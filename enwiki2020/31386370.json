    "text": "King George V Bridge George V Bridge (sometimes referred to as King George V Bridge) is a three-arched road bridge over the River Clyde in the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland, named after King George V. The bridge was designed by Glasgow City Engineer Thomas Somers and built by Melville Dundas & Whitson. It links the southside Tradeston area to Oswald Street in the city Centre. The bridge was commissioned in 1914, but was delayed due to the First World War: the bridge was not completed and opened until 1928. It is now protected as a category B listed building. Despite its appearance as a masonry bridge, the bridge is actually built of reinforced concrete box girders, faced with Dalbeattie granite. ==References== Category:Bridges in Glasgow Category:Bridges across the River Clyde Category:Road bridges in Scotland Category:Listed bridges in Scotland Category:Category B listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Gorbals Category:Bridges completed in 1928 Category:1928 establishments in Scotland ",
