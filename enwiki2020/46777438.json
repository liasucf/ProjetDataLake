The daughter eventually became an art historian specializing in Japanese art, and, at the age of 56, Marian began her printmaking career by making woodcuts and linocuts.Richie, Donald, \"Marian Korn: An Appreciation\" in Statler, Oliver, The Prints of Marian Korn, Weatherhill, New York and Tokyo, 1988, p. 14.
