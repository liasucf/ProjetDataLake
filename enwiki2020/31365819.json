    "text": "Andromeda XXII (Pisces VI, Triangulum I) is a low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxy about away from the Sun in the constellation Pisces, of the Local Group. Andromeda XXII is located much closer in projection to M33 than M31 [ vs. ]. This fact suggests that it might be the first Triangulum (M33) satellite ever discovered. However, it is currently catalogued as a satellite of Andromeda (M31).Nicolas F. Martin, Alan W. McConnachie, Mike Irwin, Lawrence M. Widrow, Annette M. N. Ferguson, Rodrigo A.

This survey was conducted with the Megaprime/MegaCam wide-field camera mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. ==See also== * Low surface brightness galaxy (LSB galaxy) * Dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) * Satellite galaxy * Triangulum Galaxy * Andromeda Galaxy * Pisces constellation ==References== Category:Dwarf spheroidal galaxies Category:Local Group Category:Andromeda Subgroup Category:Pisces (constellation) ",
