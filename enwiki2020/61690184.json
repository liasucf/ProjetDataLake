At the New York Archives, she has been involved in some of the first projects that introduced the MARC AMC format to public record repositories.

She has had a monumental impact on women's involvement in archives and helping to bring forward unheard voices of women and minorities. In an interview with the Women Archivists Roundtable, Roe explains: \"All the archival work I do, however intertwined it may be with technology, processes and procedures, is ultimately to bring those voices forward so that they can inform an incredible range of purposes from proving individual rights to molding public policy or providing the evidence for historical interpretation.\" === Published work === Roe has taught several workshops and seminars through SAA and written numerous articles in The American Archivist on the importance of archival work and the archival processing system. In one of her published journal articles, Archival Gothic to MARC Modern: Building Common Data Structures, she details her passion for archive method: > The author analyzes widely used manuals of archival description, discussing > the elements of information recommended for inclusion in various kinds of > finding aids and the implicit \"data structures\" intended to contain those > elements. She also reviews recent developments, mostly related to automation > efforts, that have led to more explicit definitions or data structures and > presents issues that must be addressed in order to define a general archival > information system standard. In a review of Roe\u2019s Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts, Susan E. Davis of the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland praises Roe\u2019s contributions to archival studies. \u201cKathleen Roe is the perfect author to take on the challenge of explaining the evolution of arrangement and description theory and practice. She has been a leader in descriptive standards development throughout the series of changes brought about by several generations of technology.\u201d In Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts, Roe describes the archival process step by step guidelines and explains the nature of archives and manuscripts as well as the functional role of arrangement and description. She explains the different stages of archival work, with acquisition and accessioning to arrangement and processing and finally the developing of accessing tools. Roe defines the principles of archiving and emphasizes the importance of context and description. Roe also describes the development of archival work and descriptive practice in Europe and North America. She remains a passionate advocate for archives and their importance to everyone. In an interview with the Women Archivists Roundtable of the SAA, Roe elaborates on the relevance of archives: > Here are some examples of how we can explain why archives are essential > evidence, why they are valuable to our society, and why they deserve support > and wide use: Nine miners harbored in a closed shaft after an explosion, and > are alive today because the rescuers used archival maps to find that closed > shaft; a teacher uses a manumission record as the tangible evidence to help > students explore the ideas of slavery and freedom; biologists use historic > maps to identify potential sites for reforestation of the American chestnut; > a 70 year old woman uses court records to locate her siblings who were > adopted out to different families after the death of their parents. That\u2019s > why archives matter. == References == Category:Living people Category:Female archivists Category:Presidents of the Society of American Archivists Category:Wayne State University alumni Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:1950 births ",
