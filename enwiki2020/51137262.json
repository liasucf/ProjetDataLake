    "text": "Gavrilo III Nikoli\u0107 () was Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Serbian Patriarch from 1752 to 1758. Before he became Serbian Patriarch, he was Metropolitan of Ni\u0161, under Serbian patriarch Atanasije II. When Atanasije died in 1752, Serbian patriarchal throne was taken by Metropolitan of Dabar-Bosnia Gavrilo Mihailovi\u0107 who also died soon after returning from Constantinople in the autumn of the same year, struck by sudden illness. Before death, he made succession arrangements with metropolitan Gavrilo Nikoli\u0107, who was elected new Serbian Patriarch as Gavrilo III. In following years, Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 was in constant internal turmoil, accompanied by worsening financial crisis and huge debts. Between 1755 and 1758, Gavrilo III was challenged by rivals and finally lost the patriarchal throne, but in 1761, a group of Serbian bishops and other ecclesiastical leaders who met in Ni\u0161 tried to bring him back, without final success. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * ==Further reading== * \u0409. \u0414\u0443\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b- \u0408\u0430\u043a\u0448\u0438\u045b: \u201e\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0458 \u0426\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0443 \u041d\u0438\u0448\u0443 1761. \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 III \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u045b\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e,\u201c \u0443: \u0417\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 II, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 1951, 135- 139. ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Gavrilo III Category:18th-century Serbian people Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire ",
