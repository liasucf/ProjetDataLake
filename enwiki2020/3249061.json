    "text": "The rufous-bellied thrush is the national bird of Brazil. Brazil has one of the richest bird diversities in the world. The avifauna of Brazil include a total of 1823 confirmed species of which 238 are endemic. Five have been introduced by humans, 78 are rare or vagrants, and four are extinct or extirpated. An additional 21 species are hypothetical (see below). Brazil hosts about 60% of the bird species recorded for all of South America. These numbers are still increasing almost every year, due to new occurrences, new species being described, or splits of existing species. About 10% of the bird species found in Brazil are, nonetheless, threatened. In June 2013 a simultaneous discovery of fifteen bird species in Brazil was announced, the first such since 1871, when August von Pelzeln described forty new species. The birds were from the families Corvidae, Thamnophilidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Tyrannidae, and Polioptilidae. Eleven of the new species are endemics of Brazil and four also inhabit Peru and Bolivia. Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society. The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC.Remsen, J. V., Jr., J. I. Areta, E. Bonaccorso, S. Claramunt, A. Jaramillo, J. F. Pacheco, C. Ribas, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F. Stotz, and K. J. Zimmer. Version 28 July 2020. A classification of the bird species of South America. American Ornithological Society. http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.htm retrieved July 29, 2020 The notes of population status, for instance (endangered), are those of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2017-3. http://www.iucnredlist.org accessed 17 February 2018 The status notes apply to the worldwide population, not solely the Brazilian population except for endemic species. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. * (V) Vagrant - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Brazil * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Brazil * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Brazil as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (H) Hypothetical - a species recorded but with \"no tangible evidence\" according to the SACC ==Rheas== Greater rhea Order: RheiformesFamily: Rheidae The rheas are large flightless birds native to South America. Their feet have three toes rather than four which allows them to run faster. * Greater rhea, Rhea americana (near-threatened) ==Tinamous== Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae Little tinamou Red-winged tinamou The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), which includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. * Gray tinamou, Tinamus tao * Solitary tinamou, Tinamus solitarius (near-threatened) * Great tinamou, Tinamus major * White-throated tinamou, Tinamus guttatus * Cinereous tinamou, Crypturellus cinereus * Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui * Brown tinamou, Crypturellus obsoletus * Undulated tinamou, Crypturellus undulatus * Brazilian tinamou, Crypturellus strigulosus * Gray-legged tinamou, Crypturellus duidae * Red-legged tinamou, Crypturellus erythropus * Yellow-legged tinamou, Crypturellus noctivagus (E) (near- threatened) * Black-capped tinamou, Crypturellus atrocapillus * Variegated tinamou, Crypturellus variegatus * Rusty tinamou, Crypturellus brevirostris * Bartlett's tinamou, Crypturellus bartletti * Small-billed tinamou, Crypturellus parvirostris * Tataupa tinamou, Crypturellus tataupa * Red-winged tinamou, Rhynchotus rufescens * White-bellied nothura, Nothura boraquira * Lesser nothura, Nothura minor (vulnerable) * Spotted nothura, Nothura maculosa * Dwarf tinamou, Taoniscus nanus (vulnerable) ==Screamers== Southern screamer Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anhimidae The screamers are a small family of birds related to the ducks.

Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. * Sabine's gull, Xema sabini (V) * Brown-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus maculipennis * Gray-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus * Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla * Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (V) * Olrog's gull, Larus atlanticus * Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis (V) * Kelp gull, Larus dominicanus * Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (V) * Brown noddy, Anous stolidus * Black noddy, Anous minutus * White tern, Gygis alba * Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata * Least tern, Sternula antillarum * Yellow-billed tern, Sternula superciliaris * Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex * Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica * Black tern, Chlidonias niger * White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (V) * Common tern, Sterna hirundo * Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii * Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea * South American tern, Sterna hirundinacea * Antarctic tern, Sterna vittata (V) * Snowy-crowned tern, Sterna trudeaui * Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis * Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus ==Sunbittern== Sunbittern Order: EurypygiformesFamily: Eurypygidae The sunbittern is a bittern-like bird of tropical regions of the Americas and the sole member of the family Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga. * Sunbittern, Eurypyga helias ==Tropicbirds== Red-tailed tropicbird Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. * Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga ==Cormorants== Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.
