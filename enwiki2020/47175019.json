Based on this company, the ministry of People's Armed Forces of Weihai established Jianguo Ironwork Cooperatives which was later renamed Coastal Ironworks. It mainly manufactured 79-type rifles and repaired steamboats. It is two years later that Coastal Ironworks moved to Weifang, where they started to manufacture 15 hp and 40 hp low-speed diesel engines. At the same time, the company was renamed Dahua Machinery Factory. In 1953, the company successfully launched the 6108 series diesel engine and was renationalized into the fourth Mechanical Industry Bureau in the first Ministry of Machine-Building Industry. The same year, it was renamed Weifang Diesel Engine Works and started research, development and production of diesel engines. Weifang Diesel Engine Works, 1953 From 1955, the Czech 6160 diesel engine was successfully trial- manufactured and became the dominant engine model for China's coastal fishing and inland shipping. Ten years later, Weichai was named one of the seventy \u201cDaqing-Type\u201d enterprises, a famous national denomination in terms of industrial production. In 1968, the 6200 marine diesel engine was developed and manufactured for light fishing vessels. In 1970, the National Defense Industry requested Weichai to develop and produce the 8V160 type tank engine. Weichai R&D; team successfully developed an 800 hp tank engine and won, in 1978, the National Science Conference Prize. In 1984, the Austrian heavy-duty vehicle engine Steyr WD615 was introduced. WD615 passed the national-level project acceptance certification in 1989, establishing a new pattern of parallel development of both medium and high-speed diesel engines for the factory. Faced to a serious situation in 1998, the new management team made \u201cThree commitments\u00bb to lead the company to implement the \u201cThree One-Thirds\u201d Property Reforms through innovation which included labor, personnel, and compensation. Weichai got its activity fields more diversified in 2000.

In 2005, Weichai launched the Euro III \u201cLandking\u201d series engines: WP10 and WP12, which are China's first Euro III diesel engines. In the same year, Weichai Power acquired Torch Automobile Group Co., Ltd. (), allowing Weichai to own, among others, heavy-duty trucks, transmissions, and axles. In 2006, Weichai Power formed the \u201cInternational Strategic Alliance\u201d with companies in the industry such as Foton, BOSCH and AVL , in order to explore new approaches for product innovation. In 2007, Weichai Power was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, creating the first domestic case of an \u201cH to A\u201d innovative capital operation. At the same time, Weichai Heavy Machinery, formerly Shandong Juli, was re-listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
