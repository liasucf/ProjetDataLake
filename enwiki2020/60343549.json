M. Kirby & Co. 5 & 10-cent Store chain[1], and a philanthropist. Kirby's company was a major rival of the much larger F. W. Woolworth & Co. and the two businesses merged in 1912. Fred Kirby then became a Vice President of the F. W. Woolworth & Co., which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Gloria Kirby was the daughter of Doris Landy Wayland and Sumner Moore Kirby (1885 -1945) who died in the Buchenwald concentration camp. Summer Moore Kirby married 1934 in third nuptials Leonida Georgievna Romanova, Grand Duchess of Russia and mother of Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia, head of the imperial house of the Romanovs. Gloria Kirby married in 1948 Robert St Clair Conahay III (1923-1984), they had three children: Richard Conahay, Cassandra Kirby-Conahay and Robert Conahay IV (1949 - 1979). === Art Collector === Gloria Kirby began collecting art in 1970 and her collection had more than a thousand works by international artists, including works by Rafael Bartolozzi, Claudio Bravo, Dar\u00edo Villalba, Guillermo P\u00e9rez Villalta, Pablo Runyan, Rafael Cidoncha, Jos\u00e9 Paredes Jardiel, Armando Pedrosa, Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Fern\u00e1ndez, Zush, Daniel Garbade, Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, Juan Mu\u00f1oz, Luis Gordillo, Juan Giralt, Antoni Mutadas, Joan Herm\u00e1ndez Pijuan, Jordy Texidor, Ceseepe, Costus and Miquel Navarro. She was a friend of the writer and composer Paul Bowles, and established the original Paul Bowles room (in 2010 it was expanded to three rooms, now named the Paul Bowles Wing) with her acquired photographs, furniture and documents dedicated to Bowles at the American Legation, Tangier. === Galerist === Gloria Kirby lived in France and studied in the United States. In 1965 she moved to Madrid where she met Fernando Vijande. Together they founded the Vandr\u00e8s Gallery. The careful selection of artists and the boldness to present avant-garde exhibitions in Francoist Spain made the Gallery well known. Times where difficult and they were denounced for their exhibition of Erotic art: \"Eros and current art in Spain\" in 1970, but fortunately they won the case with help personalities of Madrid's Art scene, such as gallery owners Elvira Gonz\u00e1lez and Juana Mord\u00f3. Franco's censorship closed the collective exhibition \"La Paloma\" with works in homage to Pablo Picasso in which artist Alfredo Alca\u00edn exhibited a naked doll; the exhibit was reopened a few days later, after the doll was dress up with some panties. In 1980 the Vandr\u00e9s Gallery was chosen as the main provider for the exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum about Spanish art: New Images From Spain (1980), curated by Margit Rowell. Kirby closed the Gallery in 1980, and Fernando Vijande reopened a Gallery under his own name in a garage in 1981. == Literature == * Claudia Arbul\u00fa Soto:Los Catalanes de Par\u00eds: un an\u00e1lisis est\u00e9tico, Dykinson, * Rafael Cervera Torres: Alaska y otras historias de la movida, Random House, Mondadori * Pablo J.
