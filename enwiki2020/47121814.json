The ground colour of the forewings is brown, but this is little visible. The basal area is glossy leaden grey, enclosing an elongate blackish white- edged median blotch from the base to one-fourth, with some dark fuscous suffusion towards the dorsum beneath this, and a light glossy leaden-grey white-edged fascia from the upper end of this area to the dorsum beyond middle limits a large irregularly rounded triangular blackish-fuscous white-edged dorsal blotch. There is a rather angulated light leaden-grey fascia from the middle of the costa confluent with the preceding fascia near the dorsum, this fascia includes a wedge-shaped streak of ground colour becoming black towards the costa. Beyond this, a white sinuate line runs from three-fifths of the costa to the dorsum before the tornus, followed on the costal half first by a blackish blotch and then a quadrate white apical blotch. There is also a smaller leaden-grey blotch on the lower half of the termen and a dark fuscous terminal line.
