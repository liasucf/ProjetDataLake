When he raises Eliezer from the dead the boy promptly resumes beating Jesus. Eliezer's parents ask Joseph, Jesus and Mary to leave Alexandria saying \"7 years is more than enough\".

Mary insists on returning to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem. The family departs for Israel. On the road to Israel Jesus and his family encounter an increasingly unwell Cleopas coughing and though Mrs. Cleopas asks Jesus to heal him , Jesus says he cannot because he has been asked not to.

Greydanus reviewed The Young Messiah for the National Catholic Register, saying it was smartly adapted by Cyrus and Betsy Nowrasteh. Greydanus said he could imagine watching the film with a mixed group of people of faith and no faith while holding everyone's interest. He says this project could have turned into \"the greatest imaginable act of authorial hubris and irrelevance\", except that the filmmakers found an elegant solution in drawing on both the Gospels and the apocryphal Gospels, while reworking all the material to bring it into conformance with right beliefs among Christians. Greydanus says that \"The Young Messiah offers an imaginative vision of the most iconic and celebrated family in human history that is both surprising and familiar, warmly human and credible yet also different.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Official resources website Category:2016 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2016 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:Films about babies Category:Films about children Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on the Gospels Category:Films directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh Category:Films produced by Chris Columbus Category:Films produced by Michael Barnathan Category:Films set in ancient Egypt Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Films shot in Matera Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film Category:CJ Entertainment films Category:1492 Pictures films Category:Focus Features films Category:Films based on works by Anne Rice ",
