    "text": "Douglas Edwin Oakervee FHKIE (born December 1940) is a British civil engineer who is a past chairman of both HS2 and Crossrail, and was the 139th president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He is often announced at dinners as coming out of retirement more times than Frank Sinatra. He was awarded the CBE in the 2010 Birthday Honours for his contributions to civil engineering. ==Early life and education== He was born in 1940 in northwest London and attended Willesden Technical College. ==Civil engineering projects== In 1991, Oakervee was appointed as project director for the Hong Kong International Airport project, built on a man-made island in the South China Sea. Before that he was the chief tunnel engineer on the Hong Kong mass transit railway project. From 2012 to 2014 he was chairman of the company constructing the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway in England. == HS2 review == In June 2019, Boris Johnson, then a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership, said he would ask Oakervee to lead a review of the plans for HS2. In August, with Johnson now Prime Minister, the review was announced and terms of reference were published by the Department for Transport. Work was completed in November but its report \u2013 known as the Oakervee Review \u2013 was not published until February 2020. The report concluded that the original rationale for HS2 was still valid as \"there is a need for greater capacity (both more trains on tracks and more seats on trains and reliability on the GB rail network). ==Honours and awards== * 2000 Awarded the OBE in the diplomatic list of the 2000 New Year Honours for services to civil engineering overseas * 2003 Appointed president of the Institution of Civil Engineers * 2008 Awarded the Institution of Civil Engineers Gold Medal * 2010 Awarded the CBE in the Birthday Honours for services to civil engineering * 2020 Elected president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers ==References== Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering Category:Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers ",
