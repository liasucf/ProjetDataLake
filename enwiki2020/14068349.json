Consisting today of just five properties with a total population (in 2007) of 19, it occupies the site of an earlier, larger village which was depopulated in the 15th and 16th centuries as the result of land clearance schemes carried out by the then lords of the manor.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=57077 British History Online A Norman church survives, now standing alone in the middle of fields, and the medieval village's fish ponds are still visible today when the river floods. ==Parish== Until 1931 the parish of Whitchurch \u2013 which includes the larger settlements of Wimpstone and Crimscote \u2013 formed (together with the parishes of Ilmington and Stretton-on-Fosse) a detached part of Warwickshire, separated from the rest of the county by an exclave of Worcestershire. John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the parish in 1870-72 thus: From 1997 to 2001, the British children's television series Teletubbies created for the BBC was filmed at a farm in Wimpstone. ==See also== *List of county exclaves in England and Wales 1844\u20131974 == References == Category:Villages in Warwickshire Category:Civil parishes in Warwickshire Category:Stratford-on- Avon District ",
