In the , Yungaburra had a population of 1,239 people. ==Geography== Yungaburra is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland. The landscape around Yungaburra has been shaped by millennia of volcanic activity. The most recent eruptions were approximately 10,000 years ago. Notable geological features nearby include: *Seven Sisters and Mount Quincan are volcanic cones. *Lake Eacham (Yidyam) and Lake Barrine are lakes inside volcanic craters. *Mount Hypipamee Crater is a diatreme (crater). *Tinaroo Dam submerged the old town of Kulara is visible, on whose cricket-pitch, when drought conditions drastically lower the water-level, locals play cricket matches. ==History== Prior to European settlement the area around Yungaburra was inhabited by about sixteen different indigenous groups, among them the Ngatjan, with the custodians being Yidinji people and neighbouring Ngajanji people. The Queensland police and native troops carried out extensive massacres in the area to rid it of blacks. In one incident in 1884, at Skull Pocket just north of the town, a group of Yidinji were surrounded at night, and at dawn mowed down after they fled on hearing the first shot. The children were brained or stabbed to death by native troopers. In the early 1880s the area around Allumbah Pocket was used as an overnight stop for miners travelling west from the coast. In 1886 the land was surveyed, and in 1891 settlers moved in. Allumbah State School opened on 7 June 1909. In 1911 it was renamed Yungaburra State School. In 1910 the railway arrived and the railway station was named Yungaburra by the Queensland Railways Department. The town was then renamed Yungaburra, to avoid confusion with another town called Allumbah. The name Yungaburra comes from the local Yidiny word janggaburru, denoting the Queensland silver ash (Flindersia bourjotiana). By 1911 indigenous numbers had fallen to 20% of the pre-settlement population due to disease, conflict with settlers and loss of habitat. In January 1911, Kulara residents began lobbying for a school, claiming there were 42 children in the district. Kulara State School opened on 17 June 1912. It closed on 1 September 1958. In 2006, the Atherton Tableland region was damaged by Cyclone Larry, rated as Category 4 cyclone on the Australian scale. Of the 19 heritage listed sites in Yungaburra, only the roofs of the community hall, police station and one of the bush cottages were badly damaged, as were the front of the Yungaburra Butchery and Gem Gallery sign. The town was restored very quickly; little evidence of the cyclone is visible. At the , Yungaburra had a population of 932.
