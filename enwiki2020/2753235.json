Cornerstone) is a town and local council in the Korazim Plateau in the Upper Galilee on the eastern slopes of Mount Kna'an in the Northern District of Israel. It was established as Gei Oni in 1878 by local Jews from Safed but was abandoned. In 1882, thirty Jewish families who had immigrated from Romania reestablished settlement as a moshavah called Rosh Pinna. The town is one of the oldest Zionist settlements in Israel. In it had a population of . ==Geography== Rosh Pinna is located north of the Sea of Galilee, on the eastern slopes of Mount Kna'an, approximately east of the city of Safed, above sea level, latitude north 32\u00b0 58', longitude east 35\u00b0 31'. North of Rosh Pina is Lake Hula, which was a swamp area drained in the 1950s. ==History== Around 1878, the Arab village of al-Ja'una sold half its lands, about 2,500 dunum, to Jews from Safed in order to fund the emigration of some of the villagers to the Hauran. Led by Elazar Rokah, the Jews moved into al- Ja'una, living among the Arabs for fear of being unable to cope with Bedouin raids on their own. They called their settlement Gei Oni (\"Valley of my Strength\") as a Hebrew adaption of the Arabic name. After one year of good harvests, a year of drought saw the Arabs mortgage their lands to money lenders, but the Jews were unwilling to do the same and left. In 1882, the settlement was renewed as a moshavah by immigrants from Romania, who named it Rosh Pinna (\"cornerstone\") after Psalm 118:22: \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\". Rosh Pinna was one of the first modern Jewish agricultural settlements in the history of the Land of Israel, then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. In 1883, it became the first Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel to come under the patronage of the Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. Rothschild's agent Joshua Ossovetski expanded the settlement with more land from Safed and Ja'una. Rosh Pinna had good relations with Ja'una, even establishing a modern Arab school there, but had some serious clashes with the el-Zangariya Bedouin tribe. Moshe David Shub (born 1854 in Moine\u015fti; died 1938 in Jerusalem) had been sent ahead to find and purchase an appropriate piece of land. Born as Mo\u015fe David Iancovici, in Palestine he became known as: \u05e9\u05d5\"\u05d1, Shub, a Hebrew abbreviation of the name of his profession, \u05e9\u05d5\u05d7\u05d8 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05e7, read \"shochet u-bod\u00e9k\", butcher and examiner [of kosher meat]; (\"shuv\" has also the Hebrew meaning of \"once again\", or \"return!\", an allusion to the main principle of Zionism; in Hebrew the same letter [\u05d1] is used for \"v\" and \"b\"). Laurence Oliphant collected funds for Rosh Pina from Christadelphians and other sympathizers in Britain.Abstract: Laurence Oliphant's interest in the development of Jewish settlement in Ottoman Palestine, preceded his interest in the plight of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. While his intensive involvement in these matters is well known, especially in modern Israel, the fact that the funds for his largesse were contributed by the Christadelphian Brotherhood has not previously been published. The present article brings to light material from the archives of this sect, and thus, too, the motivation behind these efforts. Amit, Thomas. Laurence Oliphant: Financial Sources for his Activities in Palestine in the 1880s Palestine Exploration Quarterly, Volume 139, Number 3, November 2007, pp. 205\u2013212(8) He wrote about his visit to Rosh Pina in 1886: > \"Jauna, which was the name of the village to which I was bound, was situated > about three miles (5 km) from Safed, in a gorge, from which, as we descended > it, a magnificent view was obtained over the Jordan valley, with the Lake of > Tiberias lying three thousand feet below us on the right, and the waters of > Merom, or the Lake of Huleh, on the left.
