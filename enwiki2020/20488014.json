Until the June 2012 legislative elections, he represented the 3rd constituency of the Allier department, and is a member of the Socialist Party. Major boundary changes in 2011 reduced Allier's parliamentary entitlement from 4 constituencies down to 3, and the old 3rd constituency was in effect abolished, its name and substantially its place being taken over by the pre-2012 4th constituency. Mallot chose to retire from the National Assembly at the June 2012 election. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Allier Category:Politicians from Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:Socialist Party (France) politicians Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
