    "text": "Mangled After Dinner was an English gothic rock band founded in 1981 in Manchester, England.List of Manchester Bands . Retrieved 16 April 2010. Mangled After Dinner reached a small but loyal community of fans and played an overly gloomy sound, using synthesizer effects and well-written lyrics of exceptionally romantic poetry. Their major themes included: rainstorms, dark forests, abandoned castles, English folklore and the pursuit of answers through solitude and disbelievement. ==Members== The band was formed by: * Trevor \"Poeraver\" Chadwick - vocals (1959\u20131989) * Henry Lansford - guitar (born 1961) * Frederick \"Fred\" Ritchen - bass (born 1961) * John \"Johnny\" Lansford - drums (born 1957) Their first success was Mangled After Dinner Ritual, recorded in long play with eight total tracks and a stylized black cover with a designed skull with a lit candle abovehead. The band disbanded in the late 1980s, when Chadwick died in a car crash near London in October 1989. ==Discography== * Mangled After Dinner Ritual (1981) * The Symphony of the Mangled One (1983) * Darkened Club Symphony (1984) * Hits from the Grave - M.A.D. Collection (1986) * The Hanging Man (1988) ==Bootlegs== * Voices Far Beyond (1991), collection of recorded but never released demo, outtakes and general discarded musics.
