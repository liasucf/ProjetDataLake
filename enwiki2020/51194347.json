    "text": "thumb Ricarte Madamba Puruganan (November 20, 1912 \u2013 January 15, 1998) was born in Dingras, Ilocos Norte. He is the first of six children of Honorio S. Puruganan, a musician, composer, poet and painter, and Victoria M. Puruganan, a school teacher and housewife. Puruganan is regarded as \"One of the Thirteen Moderns\", a group of artists that broke away from the Conservatives, led by Fernando Amorsolo. His paintings were exhibited side by side with those of the other masters: Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Fabian de la Rosa, Amorsolo, Victorio C. Edades, Vicente Manansala, Hernando R. Ocampo & Cesar Legaspi. The other side of Ricarte Puruganan\u2019s artistry is manifested by the 60 existing government and private edifices, sculptures and landscapes which he undertook during his 25 years of self-imposed exile from the art scene of Manila starting 1950. During those years, he spent communing with his ancestral town of Dingras, Ilocos Norte. Which is why we see in many of his paintings those scenes closest to his heart \u2013 the rustic, the indigenous; quaint seascapes and evocative agricultural.(*) Education *1920 - 1927 Dingras Elementary School *1927 - 1931 Ilocos Norte National High School *1931 - 1936 School of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines \u201cDiploma in Painting\u201d *1939 - 1941 College of Fine Arts and Architecture, University of Santo Tomas,(Degree Bachelor of Fine Arts) 'Honors as a student and a faculty member' * At UP - Awarded 6 Medals (first prize), 25 honorable mentions, and two special prizes from the President of University and from the School Director, and named \u201cMost Distinguished Graduate\u201d of the year. * Elected School Representative to the UP Student Council. * Elected Class Representative to the UP Senior Council. * Appointed \u2018Chief \u2013 Artist\u2019 of the 1936 Philippinensian. * At UST - Awarded \u201cFull Scholar\u201d for two years on the basis of maintaining excellent grades on every academic subject every semester * Appointed Instructor, School of Fine Arts, 1937 * Appointed Assistant Professor, College of Fine Arts and Architecture, 1946 * Appointed Associate Professor, 1948\u20131950 Achievements as a professional artist *1935 \u2013 Painting, \u201cComing Storm\u201d, 1st Prize Winner.
