King Farouk was removed from power in 1952 during a revolution that placed Gamal Abdel Nasser in power. In January 1956, he abolished the domestic relations court and required all decisions be made in civil court, instead of the religious court. The Egyptian Ministry of Justice appointed Rabbi Douek as a Notary Delegate in charge of all matters affecting the personal relations of Jews. This included authority on issues involving marriage, divorce, wills, children and disposition of assets.\"La Nouvelle Loi du Statut Personnel: Designation de notaires religieux pour l'enregistrement des marriage et divorces, [French], La Reforme, January 2, 1956, p. 2.

In September 1956, Rabbi Douek was appointed as deputy to Chief Rabbi Haim Nahoum, who recommended that Rabbi Haim Douek succeed him as Chief Rabbi of Egypt. When Rabbi Haim Nahoum's died in November 1960, Rabbi Haim Douek assumed responsibility for leading the Jewish community as the nation's last Chief Rabbi. At the time, the number of Jews in Egypt had dwindled to about 10,000 due to the changing political environment in Egypt. Rabbi Douek continued to preside over a community that was gradually emptying out of Egypt as they made their way to Israel, the United States and other countries. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War with Israel, Rabbi Douek and his family were ordered to go to the offices of the Chief Rabbinate, where they were held under house arrest for two weeks without outside contact. When the Egyptian government allowed Rabbi Douek to reopen the Chief Rabbinate, families of the detained men flooded his office. Rabbi Douek fielded questions from families about where their sons and brothers were detained. Still there was police presence outside and secret police inside his offices. Rabbi Douek helped families with finances, health coverage, and schools. After almost three month he was able with the help of the Red Cross to have family visitation.

The Six Day War had further accelerated the decline of the Jewish community. In 1968 there were about 2,000 Jews in Egypt, down from about 80,000 twenty years earlier. Rabbi Douek met with Egyptian politicians and dignitaries from around the world to obtain relief for the Egyptian Jews so they could leave the country. After three and a half years, all the detainees were released and permitted to leave Egypt with their families. By 1971, there were only 300 members of the community remaining. Many of these were families with young children. Rabbi Douek advised them to leave Egypt, since he saw no future there for the families. Rabbi Douek led Egypt's Jewish population during a period of political turmoil and instability. Rabbi Douek left Egypt for France in March 1972. Prior to leaving, he made sure that the remaining Jews had their religious needs met.
