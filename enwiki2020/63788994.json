She is mostly known for her efforts to raise public awareness about participation of Lithuanians in the Holocaust. == Biography == Vanagait\u0117 was born on January 25, 1955 in \u0160iauliai. From 1961 to 1972 she studied in secondary school no. 22 in Vilnius. In 1978 she graduated from the Russian Institute of Theatre Arts where she studied drama, and began publishing her theatre review articles before graduation. In 1978 she was appointed head of the theatre, cinema and TV section in ' monthly magazine, and later worked at the Literat\u016bra ir menas newspaper. From 1985 to 1989, she lived in Helsinki where she worked in the library of the University of Helsinki and wrote articles on social and cultural topics for Helsingin Sanomat newspaper. In 1989, she returned to Lithuania and became the art director of the National Youth Theatre. Since 1991 she was organizing annually the international theatre festival LIFE.

Since 2006, she is a director of Vilko valia agency. In 2015, she met Efraim Zuroff who discussed with her the extermination of the Lithuanian Jews during the Holocaust. This was the beginning of her work on writing the book M\u016b\u0161i\u0161kiai. Kelion\u0117 su prie\u0161u (Our People. A Journey with the Enemy), which was published a year later, and was translated into multiple languages (English, Polish, Russian, Hebrew). The book discusses the problem of participation of common Lithuanians in the execution of Jews and robbing of their property, a topic very much unpopular in the modern Lithuania. She was shunned by some of her relatives and friends after the publication of the book. She is currently working in cooperation with German historian Christoph Dieckmann on her new book about the Holocaust How Did It Happen?, which is expected to be published in 2020.
