    "text": "Ronald Versoza Singson (born November 18, 1968 in Manila) is a Filipino politician, businessman and concert producer. A son of the patriarch of the Singson political clan Chavit Singson, he served as representative of Ilocos Sur's first district from 2013 to 2016, and earlier from 2007 to 2010, when he resigned after being convicted for 18 months for drug possession by the Wan Chai District Court in Hong Kong. ==Career== Singson was elected as representative of Ilocos Sur's first district on the 2007 election, succeeding Salacnib Baterina who was term-limited, serving in the 14th Congress. While in Congress, he co-authored a bill giving more benefits to people involved in the judicial branch of the government. Singson relaunched music channel Channel V Philippines on December 2009. Early in 2010, Singson later was linked to actress Lovi Poe, daughter of presidential candidate Fernando Poe, Jr., a relationship downplayed by Poe when she is being interviewed by the media. Singson also became a partner of Jomari Yllana in Fearless Production, a production outfit that produces live concerts. Singson sought to defend his seat in the 2010 House of Representatives election against Beltran Baterina, winning in May 2010. On July 9, 2010, Singson's production outfit co-produced Usher's concert at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds, and was considering to bring Justin Bieber to the Philippines. In an earlier event, his company also funded the Cook-Archuelta concert held at the Mall Of Asia concert grounds.http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/442941/american-idols-david-c- david-cominghttp://www.philstar.com/entertainment/468421/saturday-night-live- david-david ==Arrest in Hong Kong== In late July 2010, it was reported that Singson had been arrested on the 11th of the month at the Hong Kong International Airport for allegedly possessing 26.1 grams of cocaine and 2 tablets of Valium. He refused to be helped by the Philippine consulate in Hong Kong, and on July 22, a judge denied him of bail on his arraignment. In August, the judge granted him bail worth HK$2 million (PHP12 million) after it was determined that the weight of the drugs seized on Singson was only 6.7 grams. Representative Miro Quimbo observed the proceedings to compile a report to Congress. In September, the court extended his bail due to him undergoing medical treatment; it also delayed Singson's plea bargaining on October. The judge then rescheduled the next hearings to November when the judge ordered Singson's lawyer to explain why a medical report would be necessary. After Singson admitted that the drugs seized were for his own personal use, his lawyers arranged him to plead guilty for drug possession; this was opposed by the prosecution that insisted that Singson was importing the drugs to Hong Kong. After pleading guilty, Akbayan representative Walden Bello urged Speaker of the House of Representatives Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. to initiate expulsion proceedings against Singson. Majority floor leader Neptali Gonzales II maintained the House of Representatives' stand was to let the trial finish. On January 2011, Stanley Chan, the judge presiding Singson's trial stood down after receiving a letter with \"prejudicial allegations\" against Singson. His father Chavit remarked after the hearing that his son was \"set up.\" Chavit later said that his son may be used as an example by the Chinese who are still angry on the Manila hostage crisis that led to the deaths of several Hong Kong residents in a bloody rescue attempt by the Manila Police District. Singson considered resigning from his House seat but urged other representatives to let the trial finish before judging him. On February 23, 2011, judge Joseph Yau agreed with Singson that the drugs were for his own personal use, since that he did not need to traffic drugs to maintain a living considering he is a member of a wealthy family, although he contended that Singson overstated his level of drug use. Singson's lawyer proposed a sentence of less than two years. Yau ruled that Singson was guilty of drug possession, sentencing him to two and a half years in prison, but reducing it by a year due to Singson pleading guilty, and his good personal background. Singson's family and Lovi Poe attending the sentencing; Chavit later said that they would not appeal the decision. On March 1, Singson resigned from the House of Representatives, with the lower house accepting his resignation and declaring a vacancy to his seat a week later. With the vacancy, the House of Representatives ordered the Commission on Elections to call a special election to fill Singson's seat. The commission subsequently scheduled the special election on May 28, where he was succeeded by his brother, Vigan Vice Mayor Ryan Singson. His father Chavit said a few weeks before Ronald's January 18, 2011 release that his son won't reenter politics and will instead focus on his businesses. ==Return to politics== Singson filed his certificate of candidacy for his old House of Representatives seat for the 2013 elections; his brother Ryan will instead contest Ilocos Sur's governorship, which is being held by Chavit, who will not run. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Nacionalista Party politicians Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Ilocos Sur Category:People from Vigan Category:Living people Category:Lakas\u2013CMD (1991) politicians ",
