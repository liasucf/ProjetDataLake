The by-election was caused by the death of the town's Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Richards, who had held the seat since the 1935 general election. The result was a victory for the Labour candidate James Idwal Jones, who held the seat with a majority of nearly 11,000 votes. == Result == == See also == * List of United Kingdom by-elections * Wrexham constituency == References == ==External links== * British parliamentary by-elections: Wrexham 1955 * UK General Election results October 1951: Wrexham * A Vision Of Britain Through Time (Constituency elector numbers) Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Welsh constituencies Category:1955 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1955 in Wales Category:1950s elections in Wales Category:Wrexham Category:March 1955 events ",
