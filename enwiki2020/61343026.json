    "text": "Are You Sleeping is the debut novel of Kathleen Barber, a lawyer. Barber acknowledges that she was influenced by the Serial podcast, and a key element of the novel is a podcast that looks into the case of prisoner who may have been wrongfully convicted of murder. The hardcover edition was published in 2017 and the paperback in 2018. Television rights were acquired, and Nichelle Tramble Spellman produced a television series for the streaming service Apple TV+, entitled Truth Be Told. ==Plot== Estranged twins Josie and Lanie Buhrman lost both their parents when they were fifteen years old. Their father was murdered, and their mother ran away to join a cult. Thirteen years later the sisters each learn that another major character, Poppy Parnell, is regularly releasing podcasts in which she investigates whether Warren Cave, the man convicted of killing their father, was wrongfully convicted. His conviction relied heavily on Lanie's eyewitness testimony. After some podcasts have been released the twins are forced to meet after their mother commits suicide. Bustle magazine published a guide to the novel for fans of the TV series, detailing major adjustments the screenwriters made in their adaptation to a visual media. For instance the novel's protagonist is Josie Burhman, one of the twins, and Poppy Parnell, the podcaster, is merely a minor character. As Parnell's podcasts dig up new evidence, Josie's doubts about Cave's convictions grow. ==References== Category:2017 American novels Category:2017 debut novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Simon & Schuster books ",
