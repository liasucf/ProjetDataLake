    "text": "Nigel Lived is the first album by the British lead vocalist and actor Murray Head, released in 1973 on CBS Records. It is a concept album which tells the story of Nigel, a young singer who arrives in London seeking to make a career in the music business. His early optimism gives way to disillusionment, struggle, and finally heroin addiction. The original vinyl release came in an elaborate package, with a lyric sheet featuring pages from Nigel's diary to depict the course of his gradual disintegration. In 2017 Intervention Records reissued Nigel Lived on 180-gram double 45RPM vinyl. The reissue was 100% analog mastered using the original master tapes provided to the label by the original sound engineer on the project, Phill Brown. The album quickly became Intervention\u2019s best selling reissue ever and resulted in Murray Head\u2019s decision to perform songs from the album live for the first time ever. ==Track listing== Side One (labelled \"Success\"): #\"Pacing On the Station\" \u2013 4:55 #\"Big City\" \u2013 3:29 #\"Bed & Breakfast\" \u2013 2:28 #\"The Party\" \u2013 3:13 #\"Ruthie\" \u2013 3:19 #\"City Scurry\" \u2013 1:58 #\"When You Wake Up in the Morning\" \u2013 3:10 Side Two (\"Failure\"): #\"Why Do We Have to Hurt Our Heads\" \u2013 3:13 #\"Pity the Poor Consumer\" \u2013 2:29 #\"Dole\" \u2013 3:05 #\"Nigel, Nigel\" \u2013 2:11 #\"Miss Illusion\" \u2013 2:18 #\"Religion\" \u2013 4:46 #\"Junk\" \u2013 8:49 ==Background== This album followed Head's appearance as Judas, a leading role on the recording of the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, and his subsequent 1971 single \"Superstar\".
