    "text": "Google frequently inserts jokes and hoaxes into its products on April Fools' Day, which takes place on April 1. == 2000 == Google's first April Fools' Day hoax, the MentalPlex hoax, invited users to project a mental image of what they wanted to find whilst staring at an animated GIF. Several humorous error messages were then displayed on the search results page, all listed below: # Error 005: KUT Weak or no signal detected. Upgrade transmitter and retry. # Error 666: Multiple transmitters detected. Silence voices in your head and try again. # Error 05: Brainwaves received in analog.

An additional error message was included which converted all navigation text to German, but was scrapped after user complaints. == 2002 == Google reveals the technology behind its PageRank Systems\u2014PigeonRank. Google touts the benefits of this cost-effective and efficient means of ranking pages and reassures readers that there is no animal cruelty involved in the process. The article makes many humorous references and puns based on computer terminology and how Google PageRank really works, (for example, a chart showing the pigeons' consumption of seed and flaxle, represented as the \"Linflax Kernel,\" a pun on the Linux kernel). * Pigeon Rank == 2004 == Fictitious job opportunities for a research center on the moon. Copernicus is the name of a new operating system they claimed to have created for working at the research center. * Google Job Opportunities: Google Copernicus Center is hiring Google also announced Gmail on April 1, with an unprecedented and unbelievable free 1 GB space, compared to e.g. Hotmail's 2 MB. The announcement of Gmail was written in an unserious jokey language normally seen in April Fools' jokes, tricking many into thinking that it was an April Fools' joke. In reality, it was a double fake, in that the announced product was serious. == 2005 == Google Gulp, a fictitious drink, was announced by Google in 2005. According to the company, this beverage would optimize one's use of the Google search engine by increasing the drinker's intelligence. It was claimed this boost was achieved through real-time analysis of the user's DNA and carefully tailored adjustments to neurotransmitters in the brain (a patented technology termed Auto-Drink; as the \"Google Gulp FAQ\" suggests, partly through MAO inhibition). The drink was said to come in \"4 great flavors\": Glutamate Grape (glutamic acid), Sugar Radical (free radicals), Beta Carotty (Beta-Carotene), and Sero- Tonic Water (serotonin). This hoax was probably intended as a parody of Google's then invite-only email service called Gmail. Although ostensibly free, the company claimed the beverage could only be obtained by returning the cap of a Google Gulp bottle to a local grocery store: a Catch-22. In the Google Gulp FAQ, Google replies to the observation \"I mean, isn't this whole invite-only thing kind of bogus?\" by saying \"Dude, it's like you've never even heard of viral marketing.\" * Google Gulp * Google Gulp FAQ == 2006 == Google Romance logo On April Fool's Day 2006, Google Romance was announced on the main Google search page with the introduction, \"Dating is a search problem. Solve it with Google Romance.\" It pretends to offer a \"Soulmate Search\" to send users on a \"Contextual Date\". A parody of online dating, it had a link for \"those who generally favor the 'throw enough stuff at the wall' approach to online dating\" to Post multiple profiles with a bulk upload file, you sleaze in addition to Post your Google Romance profile. Clicking on either of these gave an error page, which explained that it was an April Fool's joke and included links to previous April Fool's jokes. * Google Romance * Google Romance FAQ * Google Romance Tour == 2007 == === Gmail Paper === At about 10:00 pm, Pacific time (where Google has its headquarters) on March 30, 2007, Google changed the login page for Gmail to announce a new service called Gmail Paper. The service offered to allow users of Google's free webmail service to add e-mails to a \"Paper Archive\", which Google would print (on \"94% post- consumer organic soybean sputum\") and mail via traditional post. The service would be free, supported by bold, red advertisements printed on the back of the printed messages. Image attachments would also be printed on high-quality glossy paper, though MP3 and WAV files would not be printed. The page detailing more information about the service features photographs of Ian Spiro and Carrie Kemper, current employees of Google. Also featured are Product Marketing Managers of Gmail Anna-Christina Douglas, and Shane Lawrence. * Gmail Paper Index * Gmail Paper Announcement * Gmail Paper Program Policies === Google TiSP === Google TiSP (short for Toilet Internet Service Provider) was a fictitious free broadband service supposedly released by Google. This service would make use of a standard toilet and sewage lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8 Mbit/s (2 Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32 Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60 minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a Windows XP or Windows Vista computer (\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy nanobots through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by \"discreet DNA sequencing\" of \"personal bodily output\" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health. Google also referenced the diet coke-and- Mentos reaction in their FAQ: \"If you're still experiencing problems, drop eight mints into the bowl and add a two-liter bottle of diet soda.\" They also claim that Enterprise plans will include support in the event of backup problems, brownouts and data wipes. * Google TiSP * Google TiSP FAQ * Installation page * Press Release page * Not found page \u2013 April fools version == 2008 == === Blogger \"Google Weblogs (beta)\" === The Blogger dashboard featured an announcement for Google Weblogs, or \"GWeblogs,\" or \"Gblogs,\" the next revolution in personal publishing. Features include algorithms putting the user's best content at the top of the user's blog (rather than publishing by reverse chronology), automatically populating the blog's sidebar with the most relevant content, posting directly into Google search results for maximum visibility, blog headers refreshed with images from Google's team of artists for anniversaries of a scientific achievement (similar to Google Doodle), and automatic content generation ('Unsure of what to post about? Just click \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" and we'll \"take care\" of the rest!') The announcement was followed by a link to a video tour of the product, which actually led to Tay Zonday's cover of Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\" * Blogger Buzz: The Official Buzz from Blogger at Google: Announcing Google Weblogs (beta) === Daja === Google launches Daja in Japan (google.co.jp), with the mission of \"organizing the world's laughter.\" === Day === Google announced Day in Australia, a new beta search technology that will search web pages 24 hours before they are created. The name is a play on the phrase \"g'day\". * gDay === Gmail Custom Time === Gmail's sign-in page and a banner at the top of each Gmail inbox announced a new feature, called Gmail Custom Time, that would allow its users to \"pre-date\" their messages and choose to have the message appear as \"read\" or \"unread\". The new feature uses the slogan \"Be on time. Every time.\" Around 11:00 pm EST March 31, 2008, on the newer and older version of Gmail, but not in the basic HTML version, in the upper right corner, next to Settings, a link appeared labeled, \"New! Gmail Custom Time\". The link led to a 404 error until April 1, when it led to the full Gmail Custom Time hoax page. Clicking any of the three links at the bottom of the page brought the user to a page stating that Gmail Custom time was, in fact, their April Fool's Day joke. === Google Book Search Scratch and Sniff === Google Book Search has a new section allowing users to \"scratch and sniff\" certain books. Users are asked to \"...please place your nose near the monitor and click 'Go'\", which then \"loads odors\". When clicking on \"Help\", users are redirected to a page in a book that describes the origins of April Fools' Day. * Inside Google Book Search Blog: \"Google Book Search now smells better\" === Google Calendar is Feeling Lucky === Google added the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button to its calendar feature. When a user tries to create a new event, the user was given the regular option of entering the correct details and hitting \"Create Event\", and also the new option of \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" which would set the user up with an evening date with, among others, Matt Damon, Eric Cartman, Tom Cruise, Jessica Alba, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton, Angelina Jolie, Britney Spears, Anna Kournikova, Johnny Depp, George W. Bush, or Lois Griffin. === Google Manpower Search === Google launched Manpower Search (\u8c37\u6b4c\u4eba\u8089\u641c\u7d22) in China (google.cn). The feature was presented as being powered by 25 million volunteers who conducted searches around the clock. When the user entered a keyword, volunteers would search any possible answers from a mass of paper documents as well as online resources. The user was expected to get the search result within 32 seconds. The \"search\" button would avoid the user's cursor. === Google Saturi Translate === Google Korea announced that 'Google Saturi (, Korean dialect) Translate' had been opened on April 1, 2008. When the user tried to use this translator, a message appeared, explaining that it was April Fools' Day event and was not executable. === Google Talk === Google announced plans to, on April 22, 2008 (Earth Day), shorten all conversations over Google Talk thereby reducing the energy required to transmit chats in an effort to reduce carbon output. * Google Talk Goes Green === Google Wake Up Kit === Google launched their \"Wake Up Kit\" as a calendar notification option. > The 'wake up' notification uses several progressively more annoying alerts > to wake one up. First it will send an SMS message to their phone. If that > fails, more coercive means will be used. The kit includes an industrial- > sized bucket and is designed to be connected to their water main for > automatic filling. In addition, a bed-flipping device is included for > forceful removal from their sleeping quarters. === Virgle === Virgle Logo Google announced a joint project with the Virgin Group to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. This operation has been named Project Virgle. The announcement includes videos of Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) as well as Larry Page and Sergey Brin (the founders of Google) on YouTube, talking about Virgle. An \"application\" to join the settlement includes questions such as: I am a world-class expert in: After the user submitted the application, the site notifies the user that the user is not fit for space, or that the user's application is fine and \"all you have to do is submit your video\" [as a response to their video on YouTube]. As a result, an open source Virgle group has been established, OpenVirgle. On the FAQ page, the final question is \"Okay, come on \u2013 seriously. Is this Virgle thing for real?\" The reply links to a page that tells the user it's an April Fool's joke, and then mentions that the user \"Dragged us out of our lovely little fantasy world, to crush all our hopes and dreams.\" * Virgle Application Page \u2013 Virgle: The Adventure of Many Lifetimes === Yogurt === Yogurt Google's Orkut displayed its name as yogurt. === YouTube === On April 1, 2008, all featured videos on the UK and Australian homepages, and later, all international homepages, of Google-owned YouTube linked to a video of Rick Astley's song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", causing all users of the website who clicked on featured videos to be Rickrolled. This was the first year YouTube participated in Google's April Fool's Day tradition. == 2009 == === Google runs on Microsoft Windows IIS/3.0 === google.com.au reported as if it ran on IIS/3.0 and google.com on Apache/0.8.4 (on Linux). === CADIE === The announcement of CADIE was made on 31 March 2009 11:59 pm by the CADIE Team, not on April 1. The announcement on the Google blog was made at 2009/04/01 12:01:00 am. The introduction page and all of the references to CADIE in Google's Products were taken down on April 2, replaced with a message stating' > We apologize for the recent disruption(s) to our service(s). > > Please stand by while order is being restored. However the technology page describing the technical capabilities of the software remained at: Technical Description When using Google Books or GMail, a user would come across an announcement dated March 31, 2009 at 11:59:59, declaring a new \"Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity\". CADIE is also mentioned on the gBall FAQ page: \"Google's new CADIE technology will interpret the data obtained from each ball to provide useful tips to owners\". There was also a link on Google's Homepage for CADIE, and a blog entry in Google's official blog. CADIE technology is also used to generate \"senryu\" (a type of Japanese poem similar to haiku) based on search terms for certain Japanese queries. The Google Search homepage had a link to the CADIE announcement, stating that \"For several years now a small research group has been working on some challenging problems in the areas of neural networking, natural language and autonomous problem-solving. Last fall this group achieved a significant breakthrough: a powerful new technique for solving reinforcement learning problems, resulting in the first functional global-scale neuro- evolutionary learning cluster.\" The page links to the blog below. On mobile devices, a link shows up to Brain Search, which uses CADIE technology to \"index your brain\". === Gmail === When one is using the Gmail service, they will notice that it has a new option, named \"Gmail Autopilot\" in which the service would analyze an email. On that page it says under the FAQ section,\"You can adjust tone, typo propensity, and preferred punctuation from the Autopilot tab under Settings.\" However, if a person logs into their Gmail account and goes under the Settings tab they will notice that there is no Autopilot tab. The program could be customized to contain certain types of grammatical or spelling errors, as well as complexity and length of the sentence. It also has a way of responding to relationship related messages, such as if someone spoke aggressively, even in a humorous way, the system would \"terminate relationship.\" === gBall === Google Australia announced the development of a ball that will change how Australian Football is played the world over. The newest football technology\u2014\"gBall\" \u2014is a prototype ball for use in the Australian Football League with GPS. Google Australia announced (\"New! Get the newest football technology \u2013 gBall.\") that they are developing a prototype ball for use in the Australian Football League with GPS. Apparently, the ball will measure the location, force, and torque of a kick, and \"vibrate if player agents or talent scouts want to speak to you\". Google claimed that the ball will cost $10 with a cost-per-kick set of payments in addition to the basic fee. === Google Analytics === A blog post to the Google Analytics Blog investigates the analytics reports of CADIEs activities. === Google Maps === Google's CADIE has a recommended places to visit using Google Maps. Viewing \"CADIE's recommended places for humans\" one will see each of her suggested places listed, that, when clicked, displays a photo and humorous commentary. There is also a \"CADIE's recommended places for humans\" link in Google Maps, which leads to the \"Panda Mapplet\" and includes several marked locations with \"CADIE's\" commentary. Under Redmond WA a link is listed which will rick roll the viewer. === Blogger === CADIE's personal blog/homepage === Google Chrome with 3D === Screenshot of Wikipedia.org on April 2, 2009 using Chrome \"3-D\". Note the red/blue glasses toggle switch at the top of the browser A version of Google Chrome was offered rendering web pages in Anaglyph 3D, \"powered\" by CADIE. A 3D effect was actually possible with this browser, but it only made the window appear to be sunken into the monitor. * Introducing Google Chrome with 3D === Google Earth Powered by CADIE === Google announced a new Google Earth powered by CADIE, which claimed to allow the user to see ocean terrain imagery from the world's most advanced submarine, explore the deep sea, soar with CADIE in real time, view CADIE's Recommended Summer Vacation, and chat with CADIE, among other options. === Google Code === The Google Code Search homepage is featuring LOLCODE examples. CADIE is set to write code by itself based on specified features; however all that is returned is bad code or witty criticisms of the user's request and choice of programming language, recommending the use of INTERCAL. CADIE's source code was supposedly uploaded to Google Code, but she changed her mind and replaced it with a \"fun program\" consisting of 31 lines of INTERCAL. When executed, this program prints out the message \"I do not feel like sharing.\" === Google Book Search === CADIE recommends some books at Google Book Search homepage. Also, when viewing a book, there is a Generate book report button. When clicked it says \"Gotcha! It's April Fools' Day! Sorry, but you'll have to actually read the book yourself.\" === Google Docs on Demand === Google has announced new Google Docs features enhanced by CADIE Add subliminal messages and images to documents. If a person makes a new presentation and looks for the subliminal message and image buttons under the insert menu they will notice it is not there. === Google Mobile === Google Mobile has a link to \"Brain Search\". The instructions are to \"Put phone to forehead for brain indexing\" and \"Think your query\". When the user clicks \"Try Now\", a page loads with \"Brain indexing\" status. When indexing is complete, a button comes up with \"search me\". By clicking this button, the user is directed to fake search results. There are several possible results: * What's the name of that woman by the window? She's my boss's boss, but, oh man, is it Suzanne? Susan? Blanche? * Should I order the pizza? I don't remember if it makes me gassy. * Wow, cute guy. Should I go up to him? * Why is everyone looking at me so strangely? * When is Mom's birthday? I should send her a card. === Google Knol === Knol was updated so that all of the featured articles were about Artificial Intelligence, with a message from CADIE indicating that this \"improvement\" was for the good of mankind. === HTTP Headers === In keeping with the CADIE theme Google has altered the server HTTP header to contain the name of various AI entities, including HAL 9000, WOPR, and GLaDOS. Other server HTTP headers found were IIS/Bob (a reference to Microsoft Bob), IIS/Clippy (a reference to Clippy), IIS/3.0, Netscape iPlanet, Chrome/3.0, Google Operating System (BETA), CERN/3.0 (a reference to CERN HTTPd), Apple (a reference to Apple II), IRIX, MCP, Apache/0.8.4, Conficker, and Skynet. === Oil Tanker Data Center === During the last minutes of Google's Data Center Efficiency Summit, Urs Hoelzle presented in a \"special topic\": Google had bought an oil tanker, the \"M/S Sergey\", where Google's data center containers were being submerged in oil tanks to enable extremely high-efficiency cooling. The presentation can be seen in , and includes slightly customized Wikipedia images from the article Oil tanker, including a retouched photo of commercial oil tanker AbQaiq and the oil tankers side view graphic. Even though Google did apply for a US patent to build data centers on cargo ships and oil cooling is an existing technology, summit attendee James Hamilton believed this topic to be an April Fools joke. The ship's name \"M/S Sergey\" is also likely to be a pun on Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. == 2010 == === Google and Topeka, Kansas, Switch Places === In early March, the city of Topeka, Kansas, temporarily changed its name to Google in an attempt to capture a spot in Google's new broadband/fiber-optics project. Then, on April 1 (April Fools' Day), Google jokingly announced that it would be changing its name to Topeka, to \"honor that moving gesture\" and changed its home page to say Topeka in place of the Google logo. === Google Books available in Anachrome 3D === Google books introduced a feature which allows any book to be read in 3D, assuming the viewer has appropriate glasses. It was enabled by clicking the \"View in 3D\" button in the menu bar above the book. This feature was removed after April 1, but on June 29, 2010, Google announced its restoration. Google also released the latest form of 3D glasses, similar to the pairs one would use today when seeing a film. === Store anything on Google Docs === Google announced that Google Docs will have the capacity to upload anything, including physical objects like keys, remote controls, etc. The site declared that one could use this to find items like keys using CTRL-F and send objects around the globe by \"uploading\" and \"downloading\" them, at the low price of $0.10 per kg. === Search results generated in different units === Google's search results page displayed the time taken to load the results in different units from seconds. Several of these are pop culture references, as with 1.21 gigawatts, while others refer to slang: * at warp X.XX * 0.XX centibeats * 0.XX centons * X.XXe-15 * 0.0X femtogalactic years * 1.21 gigawatts * X.XX hertz * XX.XX jiffies * 0.XX microfortnights * 0.XX microweeks * 0.XX nanocenturies * 11.90 parsecs * 0.XXe+43 Planck times * 23.00 skidoo * 2.00 shakes of a lamb's tail * 0.XX times the velocity of an unladen female swallow * dhaka time === YouTube ASCII video filter === The logo of YouTube was overlaid with ASCII text repeating the character \"1\". The YouTube logo was a reference to some videos having a new quality setting, namely \"TEXTp\". According to a notice underneath the videos, viewing the video with this quality setting enabled allowed YouTube to save one US dollar ($1) per second on bandwidth costs. The notice also remarked on the source of this new \"feature,\" wishing the reader a happy April Fool's Day. However, in accordance with the announcement, the video quality on many videos was indeed able to be set to 'TEXTp' and video output was rendered through an ASCII filter. This feature was removed on April 2, 2010. === Animal Translator BETA === Google placed a link on the main page, advertising a new Google Animal Translator service to add to their Language Translator service. Clicking the link would take the user to a page advertising an app for Android phones for the translator, with the tagline being \"Bridging the gap between animals and humans\". * Google Translate for Animals Once the app is installed on an Android phone, it provides some amusing translations depending on the animal selected. === Standard Voicemail Mode for Google voice === Google placed a New! Standard Voicemail Mode link in the Google Voice main page. === Evil Bit === Google added an \"evil bit\" to their AJAX APIs, to aid in generating an appropriate response to nefarious deeds. If an evildoer is \"detected\", the code returns with, among other things, \"For Great Justice\", a quotation from the video game Zero Wing. Conversely, setting the evil bit to 'false' will return the Google Search results for 'April Fools' encoded in JSON. === Wave Wave Notifications === Google Wave can be set to have a human being waved at by the user to notify the user of a change to a Google Wave. The user can also select the volume of the human notifier from a list of silent, medium, loud and vibrate. They can also select which human notifier they want, including Ashton Kutcher, Dr. Wave, Grandma, Werner Heisenberg, and Puppy. Clicking on any of the links on the new notifications page redirected the user to a Google help page, alerting them that it was an April Fools' joke, but also that email notifications are possible. === Google Annotations Gallery === The Google Annotations Gallery (\"GAG\") is an exciting new Java open source library that provides a rich set of annotations for developers to express themselves. === Disemvoweling on Gmail === The English-language home page of Gmail, including its logo, was disemvowelled. A post on the Gmail blog was created to address the issue, claiming that they had encountered a server error which firstly made the data centers fail to render the vowel 'a' before failing to render the vowels, and were working on the problem. They also claimed to be investigating whether the letter 'y' was impacted. === Chrome Sounds (Google Chrome Extension) === Google created a new extension, Chrome Sounds, after \"months deep in psychoacoustic models, the Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon sampling theorem, Franssen effects, Shepard-Risset Tones, and 11.1 surround sound research\". The extension provides audio for actions performed within the Google Chrome web browser. For a few interesting sounds, try going to different countries' localized Google pages. The full list of sounds that this extension makes can be found by going to the Chrome Tools menu, choosing Extensions, turning on developer mode, and viewing the source of the extension. === Google Analytics Goes Back to Hits === Google decided that hits really is the only metric for tracking web site usage. === Life sized Picasa === Google offered an option which allows the user to print life-size cardboard cutouts of all of their photos. === ReaderAdvantage Program === Google announced a reward program for Google Reader, known as ReaderAdvantage, in which they would assign points to users depending on the number of items read on Google Reader.

If subtitles are enabled when watching the video, intertitles will be displayed containing the dialogue. The upload page also featured an option to \"send a horse-drawn carriage to me to pick [the video] up\". In addition, a few videos were made parodying several viral videos, such as the \"Flugelhorn Feline\". === Gmail Motion === A body gesture oriented way to send and view mail through Gmail. In the \"How it Works\" Section it reads \"Gmail Motion uses your computer's built-in webcam and Google's patented spatial tracking technology to detect your movements and translate them into meaningful characters and commands. Movements are designed to be simple and intuitive for people of all skill levels.\" An overview video presented by Gmail product manager Paul McDonald explains Gmail Motion's \"language of movements that replaces type entirely\" while a mime artist performs the full- body Gmail actions. Upon clicking the \"Try Gmail Motion\" button, it explains to the user about the prank, and says \"Gmail Motion doesn't actually exist. At least not yet...\" The page also offers a preview of the features of Google Docs Motion. * Gmail Motion * Google Docs Motion === Google Docs Motion === Using Gmail Motion's technology, Google has promoted the BETA version of Google Docs Motion which \"will introduce a new way to collaborate \u2013 using your body\" in their Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations, Drawings, and Document List tools. === Autocompleter Job === A YouTube video was posted by Google showing a \"Google Autocompleter\" employee explaining the job.

On the website, they also gave away free Google Chrome finger sweatbands for a limited time. === Japan === Due to the large- scale devastation from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, in lieu of a traditional April Fools hoax, Google Japan featured many never-before featured drawings from its 2009 Google Doodle competition, themed \"What I Love About Japan\" drawn by Japanese schoolchildren, saying \"We promised that only the top prize winners would be featured on Google, but as this is the only day where lies are forgiven, we have obtained the other children's understanding.\" As a small concession to the usual festivities, the Google Blog mentioned, \"This year's April Fools joke has been postponed until next year. Next year's April Fool's joke has been postponed until the year following that.\" === Google === Google teleport is a service that allows user to time travel. The site is written in Simplified Chinese.
