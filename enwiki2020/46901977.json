In 1930, the Dallas Baby Camp grew into the Bradford Hospital for Babies, which merged with Children's Hospital of Texas and Richmond Freeman Memorial Clinic in 1948 to form what is now known as Children's Medical Center Dallas. Children's Medical Center affiliated with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 1964. In 2014, Children's Medical Center expanded into Children's Health. ==Facilities== ===Children's Medical Center Dallas=== Children's Medical Center Dallas, the original hospital of the Children's Health system, is an academic medical center campus anchored by a 490-bed hospital It features 16 operating rooms and provides care in more than 60 specialties. ===Children's Medical Center Plano=== Built in 2008, Children's Medical Center Plano is the second hospital included in the Children's Health system.
