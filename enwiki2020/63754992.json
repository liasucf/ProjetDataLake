    "text": "Junior Songfestival () is a Dutch televised music competition for children, held annually since 2003. It is the children's version of the Nationaal Songfestival. The winner of the contest goes on to represent The Netherlands in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest (), an international version of the competition. == History == The first edition was organised in 2003 by Dutch broadcaster AVRO (which later became AVROTROS). Kids of age 8 through 15 could submit their own original songs, of which nine songs advanced to the televised final. From 2004 until 2015, the candidates also sang a common song that did not compete, and (with the exception of 2006) the show also consisted of two televised semi-finals. In 2016, there was no televised show; the entrant for that year's Junior Eurovision Song Contest was selected internally. Also, since that year the auditors no longer need to submit original songs. The show returned in 2017 with semi-finals, but the finalists sang covers instead of original songs. Since 2018, there are no semi-finals and original songs are written for the finalists. == Past editions == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! width=\"20px\" |Year ! width=\"210px\" |Presenter(s) ! width=\"160px\" |Winning artist(s) ! width=\"270px\" |Winning song ! width=\"20px\" |Pts. ! width=\"180px\" |Common song |- |2003 | rowspan=\"2\" |Angela Groothuizen |Roel Felius |\"Mijn ogen zeggen alles\" |118 | |- |2004 | |\"Hij is een kei\" |32 |\"Wij gaan ervoor\" |- |2005 |Tooske Ragas |Tess Gaerth\u00e9 |\"Stupid\" |36 |\"Alles wat ik wil\" |- |2006 | rowspan=\"4\" |Sipke Jan Bousema | |\"Goed\" |30 |\"Vrij\" |- |2007 |Lisa, Amy & Shelley |\"Adem in, adem uit\" |36 |\"Laat ons zijn wie we zijn\" |- |2008 | |\"1 dag\" |34 |\"Ojee ojee\" |- |2009 |Ralf Mackenbach |\"Click Clack\" |36 |\"Morgen is vandaag\" |- |2010 | rowspan=\"4\" |Ewout Genemans | |\"My Family\" |32 |\"Famous\" |- |2011 |Rachel Traets |\"Ik ben een teenager\" |36 |\"Yeah!
