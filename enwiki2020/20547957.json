It is owned and operated by the City of Ontario. Omnitrans Route 81 provides connecting transit a short walk away. Rail service does not operate on weekends. Bus service operates 7 days a week. There are approximately 500 parking spaces available. East Ontario is the closest station to Ontario International Airport. Airport passengers can connect to Route 81, which will take them to the consolidated rental car facility on Haven Avenue, where an airport shuttle will deliver them to the terminal. Due to the relatively limited schedule of Route 81, and the walking involved, some passengers may find an easier airport connection via Route 61 at the Downtown Pomona station. ==Platforms and tracks== == See also == * Ontario station (Amtrak) ==References== == External links == * *Omnitrans Category:Metrolink stations in San Bernardino County, California Category:Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach stations in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1993 ",
