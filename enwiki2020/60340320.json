In 2009, Castro was loaned to Liniers of Torneo Argentino B. One goal in twenty-three appearances followed. He returned to his parent club in 2010, subsequently making his debut in the Copa Argentina versus Sportivo Desamparados on 30 November 2011. A second loan spell away arrived in August 2012, with the midfielder signing for Juventud Unida Universitario. He made his bow in a 3\u20131 loss to Rivadavia on 26 August. Castro left Gimnasia y Esgrima in 2013, joining Uni\u00f3n Mar del Plata. Season two ended with promotion. After scoring goals versus Guaran\u00ed Antonio Franco, Independiente Rivadavia and Chacarita Juniors in his debut second tier campaign as they were relegated, Castro then completed a move to Crucero del Norte to remain in Primera B Nacional. Castro played in fifty- seven games and netted seven goals across all competitions in two seasons with Chacarita Juniors, with his last two goals coming in a 3\u20130 win over Estudiantes in April 2017. In the succeeding August, having suffered his second career relegation, Quilmes completed the signing of Castro. Thirteen appearances occurred with them. Ten months later, Castro agreed to join his seventh senior team in Sarmiento. His first appearance was in a fixture with Olimpo on 26 August, as he featured for eighty-five minutes before being substituted for Juan Caviglia. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Gimnasia y Esgrima |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2010\u201311 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2012\u201313 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!1!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Liniers (loan) |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Argentino B |23||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||23||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Juventud Unida Universitario (loan) |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"2\"|Torneo Argentino A |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Uni\u00f3n Mar del Plata |2013\u201314 |18||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||4 |- |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal A |10||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Torneo Federal A play-offs||0||11||0 |- |2015 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |39||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||39||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !67!!8!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!68!!8 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Crucero del Norte |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |20||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||21||1 |- |2016\u201317 |36||6||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||36||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !56!!7!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!57!!7 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Quilmes |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |13||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||13||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sarmiento |2018\u201319 |17||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||17||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !185!!16!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!189!!16 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from General Paz Partido Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Torneo Argentino B players Category:Torneo Argentino A players Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata footballers Category:Liniers de Bah\u00eda Blanca players Category:Juventud Unida Universitario players Category:Uni\u00f3n de Mar del Plata footballers Category:Crucero del Norte footballers Category:Quilmes footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Sarmiento footballers Category:San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n footballers ",
