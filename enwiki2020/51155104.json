It was the third album released by the pair, and their last recording for 12 years. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance at the 6th Annual Grammy Awards in 1964; it lost to Allan Sherman's song \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)\". Characters on the album include the Italian film director \"Federico Fetuchini\" (inspired by Federico Fellini), the Nazi inspired \"Adolph Hartner\", and the British Tippy Skittles K.C.V.B. ==Reception== The Negro Digest positively reviewed the album in their September 1963 issue, highlighting the satire on Italian film directors as the \"richest ore of humour in this platter\". Referencing the character's imaginary film, Rape, the Negro Digest wrote that \"Everything is rape with Mr. Fetuchini. He loves it. And so will the listener\". == Track listing == # \"The Cannes Film Festival\" \u2013 9:59 # \"Dr. Felix Wheird\" \u2013 5:26 # \"2000 and Two Year Old Man\" \u2013 9:41 # \"The L.M.N.O.P.
