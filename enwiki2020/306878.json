There are two men by this name in the Hebrew Bible. In , Baal-hanan is a King of Edom. He is also mentioned in the King List in . He succeeded Shaul and was himself succeeded by Hadad. He was the son of Achbor. He is called the son of Achbor; but the name of his native city is not given. For this and other reasons, Marqaurt supposes that \"son of Achbor\" is a duplicate of \"son of Beor\" (Gen. 36:32), and that \"Baal-hanan\" in the original text is given as the name of the father of the next king, Hadar.Josef Markwart (Joseph Marquart), Fundamente Israelitischer und J\u00fcdischer Gesch. 1896, pp. 10 et seq. The date and even historicity of his reign are unknown, as he is not mentioned in any other surviving source. In the Books of Chronicles there is also a second man by this name, from the city of Geder. In he is described as being responsible to King David for the care of olive and sycamore trees. ==References== * Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Kings of Edom ",
