It is a Canadian membership organization of radio, television and online journalists, news directors, producers, executives and educators. It was founded in 1962 as the Canadian equivalent of the U.S.-based RTNDA (now the RTDNA) to set standards for the field of broadcast journalism. The RTDNA code of ethics is the guideline by which the CBSC makes its rulings regarding complaints about radio and television broadcasts. RTDNA Canada has over 400 member stations. ==See also== *Canadian Broadcast Standards Council *Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ==External links== *RTDNA Canada Category:1962 establishments in Canada Category:Radio organizations in Canada Category:Television organizations in Canada Category:Canadian journalism organizations Category:Organizations established in 1962 ",
