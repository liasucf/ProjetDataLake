    "text": "I Love You but I Must Drive Off This Cliff Now is the first studio album by American musical duo Got a Girl. It was released on Bulk Recordings on July 22, 2014. It peaked at number 27 on Billboards Heatseekers Albums chart. == Production == The duo revealed that the album would feature heavy influences of French pop music, which were a shared interest between the two. According to Vents Magazine, Dan the Automator has \"assembled a rich, enveloping sound world all its own, with hints of Laurel Canyon folk, yacht rock, and sunshine pop stylized and synthesized through sumptuous arrangements, intricate electronics, and unfettered melodic invention,\" whereas he has collaborated with Mary Elizabeth Winstead to write the lyrics. In an interview with Complex, Winstead also details the inspiration behind the album \u2014 \"French '60s pop\u2014Jane Birkin, and stuff like that. It's kind of married with Dan's sensibility, which is his beats and a little bit of that low-key hip-hop vibe. So it makes for something that's very unique; it's very lounge-y and light. It's got a little bit of a French quality.\" == Release == In May 2013, the official promo track \"You and Me\" was released. It was promoted as the first single from their upcoming album, but according to the track list that was released, it will not be included in the album.
