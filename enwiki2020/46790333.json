In some places they were defined as neither exclusively mestizo (Indigenous American-European descent), nor mulatto (West African-European descent), nor zambo (Indigenous American-West African descent). In colonial Mexico, pardo \"became virtually synonymous with mulatto, thereby losing much of its indigenous referencing.\" In the eighteenth century, pardo might have been the preferred label for blackness. Unlike negro, pardo had no association with slavery.Vinson, Ben III. Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 45, 88-89. Casta paintings from eighteenth-century Mexico use the label negro never pardo to identify Africans paired with Spaniards.Katzew, Ilona. Casta Painting. New Haven: Yale University Press 2004. In Brazil, the word pardo has had a general meaning, since the beginning of the colonization. In the famous letter by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, for example, in which Brazil was first described by the Portuguese, the Indigenous Americans were called \"pardo\": \"Pardo, naked, without clothing\". The word has ever since been used to cover African/European mixes, South Asian/European mixes, Amerindian/European/South Asian/African mixes and Indigenous Americans themselves. For example, Diogo de Vasconcelos, a widely known historian from Minas Gerais, mentions the story of Andresa de Castilhos. According to 18th- century accounts, Andresa de Castilhos was described by the following: \"I declare that Andresa de Castilhos, parda woman ... has been freed ... is a descendant of the native gentiles of the land ... I declare that Andresa de Castilhos is the daughter of a white man and a (Christian) neophyte (Indigenous) woman\".Diogo de Vasconcelos, History of Minas Gerais, volume 1, testament of the Colonel Salvador Furtado Fernandes de Mendon\u00e7a, from about 1725) The historian Maria Le\u00f4nia Chaves de Resende says that the word pardo was used to classify people with partial or full Amerindian ancestry. A Manoel, natural son of Ana carij\u00f3, was baptized as a 'pardo'; in Campanha several Indigenous Americans were classified as 'pardo'; the Amerindian Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, Joana Rodriges and Andreza Pedrosa, for example, were described as 'freed pardo'; a Damaso identifies as a 'freed pardo' of the 'native of the land'; etc. According to Chaves de Resende, the growth of the pardo population in Brazil includes the descendants of Amerindian and not only those of African descent: \"the growth of the 'pardo' segment had not only to do with the descendants of Africans, but also with the descendants of the Amerindian, in particular the carij\u00f3s and bastards, included in the condition of 'pardo'\". The American historian Muriel Nazzari in 2001 noted that the \"pardo\" category has absorbed those persons of Amerindian descent in the records of S\u00e3o Paulo: \"This paper seeks to demonstrate that, though many Indians and mestizos did migrate, those who remained in S\u00e3o Paulo came to be classified as pardos.\" == Pardos in Hispanic America == Most pardos within Hispanic America historically inhabited the territories where the Spanish conquistadors imported slaves during colonial times, such as the Captaincies of Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Venezuela, as well as the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. For example, the 1887 census conducted by Spain of Puerto Rico showed Aguadilla municipality had a population of 16,140 with 1,390 pardo men and 1,650 pardo women, with the rest classified as black or white. In Peru, Pardos (or Afro-Mestizo), are referred to the mixture of Spanish and Amerindian with a little afro contribution, located exclusively along the whole coast, in greater proportion between the regions of Tumbes to Ica. == Pardos in Brazil == In Brazil, ' is a race/skin color category used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in Brazilian censuses, with historic roots in the colonial period. The term \"'\" is more commonly used to refer to mixed-race Brazilians, individuals with varied racial ancestries. The other categories are ' (\"White\"), ' (\"Black\"), ' (\"yellow\", meaning East Asians), and ' (\"indigene\" or \"indigenous person\", meaning Amerindians). The term is still popular in Brazil. According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), ' is a broad classification that encompasses Multiracial Brazilians such as ' and ', as well as assimilated Amerindians known as ', mixed with Europeans or not. The term ' was first used in a Brazilian census in 1872. The following census, in 1890, replaced the word ' by ' (that of mixed origins). The censuses of 1900 and 1920 did not ask about race, arguing that \"the answers largely hid the truth\".MAGNOLI, Dem\u00e9trio.
