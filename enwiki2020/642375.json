Distance is the fourth-best-selling album in Japan of all time with over 4.47 million copies sold, and sold over three million copies in its debut week, setting Japan's one-week sales record and the world's highest one-week sales in a single territory, Hamasaki's album having the second highest ever,ORICON STYLE - Weekly album chart : 2nd week of April 2001 a record held by the two albums until 2015, when Adele's third album 25 sold 3.4 million copies in its first week in the United States. According to Oricon, Distance is the highest selling Japanese album of the decade. Globally, the album was one of the best- selling of 2001, being listed at number 10 on the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's Top 50 Global Best Selling Albums list for 2001. ==Production== For this album, Utada worked with American producers for a few tracks: Rodney Jerkins, who has worked with the likes of Toni Braxton, produced (and performed rap vocals on) the track \"Time Limit\", while songwriters Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced both \"Wait & See (Risk)\" and the Up-in-Heaven mix of \"Addicted to You\". The melody of \"Kotoba ni Naranai Kimochi\" was originally introduced on the track \"Interlude\" found on the First Love album. Due to time constraints, the song could not be finished on time for release in full on First Love, and was carried over to this album. The title of the track \"Hayatochi-remix\" is a portmanteau Utada created of \"Hayatochiri\", the name of the original song on the \"Wait & See (Risk)\" single, and the word \"remix\". The song \"Distance\" was originally planned to be a single without any alterations, but it was instead released in a rearranged ballad form called \"Final Distance\" in memory of a fan who died in the June 2001 Osaka school massacre; this new version would appear on her next album, Deep River. The cover art for the album, as well as the whole album photography, was done by her then husband and director Kazuaki Kiriya. ==Track listing== ==Singles== The singles released from Distance would become the biggest hits of Utada's career in terms of physical sales. Three of the four singles sold at least a million units, earning a Million certification from the RIAJ and making the Top 100 list of best-selling singles in Japan, while \"For You\" / \"Time Limit\" fell just short of that mark, selling just a little over 900K (909,000). {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Date !align=\"left\"|Title !align=\"left\"|Peak position !align=\"left\"|Weeks !align=\"left\"|Sales |- |align=\"left\"|November 10, 1999 |align=\"left\"|\"Addicted to You\" |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|16 |align=\"left\"|1,784,050 |- |align=\"left\"|April 19, 2000 |align=\"left\"|\"Wait & See (Risk)\" |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|21 |align=\"left\"|1,662,060 |- |align=\"left\"|June 30, 2000 |align=\"left\"|\"For You\" / \"Time Limit\" |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|13 |align=\"left\"|909,000 |- |align=\"left\"|February 16, 2001 |align=\"left\"|\"Can You Keep a Secret?\" |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|11 |align=\"left\"|1,485,000 |} ==Personnel== *Miyake Akira \u2013 producer *Nishihira Akira \u2013 arranger, keyboards, programming *David Barry \u2013 guitar *John Blackwell \u2013 drums *Darnell Davis \u2013 keyboards *Paul Foley \u2013 editing *Steve Hodge \u2013 engineer, mixing *Goh Hotoda \u2013 engineer, shaker, mixing *Jimmy Jam \u2013 arranger, producer, musician *Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering *Rodney Jerkins \u2013 arranger, programming, producer, engineer, rap *Terry Lewis \u2013 arranger, producer, musician *Harvey Mason, Jr. \u2013 engineer, editing *Michael McCoy \u2013 assistant engineer *Alexander Richbourg \u2013 producer, drum programming *Philippe Saisse \u2013 keyboards *Dexter Simmons \u2013 mixing *Xavier Smith \u2013 drum programming, assistant engineer *Mike Tocci \u2013 assistant engineer *Sanada Yoshiaki \u2013 executive producer *Honda Yuichiro \u2013 guitar, arranger, keyboards, programming, pre-production arranger *Toriyama Yuji \u2013 guitar ==Charts== Japan (Oricon) {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Release !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Peak position !align=\"left\"|Debut sales !align=\"left\"|Sales total !align=\"left\"|Chart run |- |align=\"left\"|March 28, 2001 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Daily Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"left\"| |align=\"left\"| |align=\"left\"| |- |align=\"left\"|March 28, 2001 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Weekly Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"left\"|3,002,720 |align=\"left\"|4,472,343 |align=\"left\"|51* |- |align=\"left\"|March 28, 2001 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Yearly Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"left\"| |align=\"left\"| |align=\"left\"| |} ==See also== *List of fastest-selling albums ==References== Category:2001 albums Category:Utada Hikaru albums Category:Albums produced by Rodney Jerkins Category:Albums produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis Category:Japanese- language albums Category:Universal Music Japan albums ",
