    "text": "Lac-Ashuapmushuan is an unorganized territory in the Canadian province of Quebec, Canada, located in the regional county municipality of Le Domaine-du- Roy. The region had a population of 28 as of the Canada 2011 Census, and covered a land area of 14,998.91 km2. It is home to the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. The eponymous Ashuapmushuan Lake is roughly in the centre of the territory. This lake, about long by wide, is the source of the Ashuapmushuan River. Its name is of Innu origin, meaning \"place where one lies in wait for moose\". In 1685, French fur traders set up a trading post near Lake Ashuapmushuan that remained almost continuously in operation until the middle of the 19th century. It successively came under control of the Traite de Tadoussac (French period), King's Posts (English period), the North West Company (1802), and the Hudson's Bay Company (1821). Quebec Route 167 goes through the territory, but there are no services or fuel available for its entire length. == Etymology == The Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve and the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan take their name from the Ashuapmushuan River. This river flows into Lake Saint-Jean and was frequently traveled by fur traders at the time of the New France and also the English regime, in order to make commercial treaties, especially human trafficking fur. This river was a preferred axis to connect in canoes between Lac Saint- Jean and James Bay. This area is renowned for hunting and fishing. ==Demographics== Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 census * Population in 2011: 28 (2006 to 2011 population change: -20.0%) * Population in 2006: 35 * Population in 2001: 0 * Population in 1996: 0 * Population in 1991: 3 Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 15 (total dwellings: 1,326) ==References== ==External links== * == See also == *Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality *Rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours (Ashuapmushuan River) *Ovide River, *Petite rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours (rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'Ours) - West *Petite rivi\u00e8re Eus\u00e8be *Rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 la Carpe (Petite rivi\u00e8re Eus\u00e8be) *Deuxi\u00e8me bras des Iroquois, un cours d'eau *List of unorganized territories in Quebec Category:Unorganized territories in Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts ",
