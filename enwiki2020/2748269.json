Through the Foundation for Economic Education, Raico and his classmate George Reisman arranged to meet with economist Ludwig von Mises, who subsequently invited them to attend his graduate seminar on Austrian economics at the New York University.. There, he met fellow seminar attendee Murray Rothbard, who befriended him... Rothbard and his friends Raico, Reisman, Ronald Hamowy and Robert Hessen formed a \"self-conscious intellectual and activist salon\" they named the Circle Bastiat... In the mid-1950s, the Circle Bastiat also brought Raico into contact with novelist Ayn Rand and her followers, informally known at the time as The Collective.. Raico attended the first lectures about Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.. Eventually, relations between the two groups soured, leading to an incident in which the Circle parodied the Collective, performing a skit in which Raico played the part of Rand's protege Nathaniel Branden.. By the summer of 1958, Rand and Rothbard had broken off all ties, and the groups stopped associating. Raico received his B.A. from the City College of New York and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where his adviser was Friedrich Hayek.. == Career == While at the University of Chicago, Raico founded The New Individualist Review, a libertarian publication which first published in April 1961 and produced 17 issues until it ceased publication in 1968.. Raico and other graduate students comprised the editorial board. Hayek and Milton Friedman and later economist George Stigler were on the advisory board.
