The song reached #21 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. ==Content== The narrator sings of growing up in a small home in a small community, reflecting on knowing the \u201cgroan of every stair\u201d in the house and the \u201cname of every street\u201d in the town. She reflects that while these small communities and homes seem perfect and ideal to an outsider, they hide their own secrets and perils, and that everyone\u2019s greatest fear is that their \u201chouse of cards\u201d will be discovered and everything will crash down around them. ==Music video== The music video begins by showing a family smiling happily for a family photo. Once the photo is taken, the fa\u00e7ade falls away and the fighting, despair, and turmoil of the family is revealed. The father is an alcoholic who is buried in his work and talking to a mistress on the phone, the mother is mentally overwhelmed trying to hold up the image of her \"perfect\" family and chain smokes as a way to escape her reality as she works on a stack of Christmas cards. The older child struggles with beauty and self-esteem issues, while the younger child, feeling like he is caught in the crossfire of the family turmoil, retreats to the attic of the home, where he builds a large house of playing cards which in the end crashes to the ground. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1995) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|22 |} ==References== Category:1995 singles Category:1994 songs Category:Mary Chapin Carpenter songs Category:Songs written by Mary Chapin Carpenter Category:Columbia Records singles ",
