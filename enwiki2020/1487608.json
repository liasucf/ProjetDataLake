Polyphonic HMI and HSS have caused some controversy in the music industry because of fears (denied by Polyphonic HMI) that it removes the \"magic\" from music production. Several stars are suspected to have used the system to improve their chances of having a hit, including: *Norah Jones *Anastacia *Maroon 5 The software correctly predicted the success of Norah Jones' debut album Come Away with Me months before it topped the charts, contradicting skeptical studio executives.Studio 360 commentary . 01-10-2004. Accessed on: 19-03-2009. In December 2005, amidst disagreements with Polyphonic's parent company, the senior management team, including co- founder Mike McCready and the advisory board made up of music industry veterans, left the company and formed Platinum Blue Music Intelligence, a competing company based in New York City. ==References== ==External links== * Article in Le Monde about Polyphonic HMI * Hit Song Science Is Not Yet a Science - a study that appeared in ISMIR 2008.
