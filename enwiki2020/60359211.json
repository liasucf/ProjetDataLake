It is a double album, and features collaborations with Lil Durk, XXXTentacion, Quavo and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, amongst others. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200. ==Background== The album is split into two sides; The TrapStar and The PopStar; the former \"focuses more on his humbling upbringing in the skin-toughening streets of Philly\", whereas the latter \"showcases the life he lives now as he finally celebrates and enjoys the fruits of his labor\". PnB Rock stated that he wanted to do a double album \"so you get both sides of me. That was me then, and this is me now. You know, you see the growth and the level up.\" He also held a listening party for the album in Philadelphia. ==Commercial performance== TrapStar Turnt PopStar debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 with 42,000 album-equivalent units (including 2,000 pure album sales) in its first week. It is PnB Rock's first US top ten debut. The album also accumulated a total of 45.73 million on- demand audio streams for its songs in its debut week. ==Track listing== Notes * signifies an original producer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 2 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 94 |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:PnB Rock albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Cardo Category:Albums produced by Diplo ",
