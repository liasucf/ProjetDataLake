Typically, they consist of archbishops and/or Primates, diocesan bishops and sometimes suffragan and coadjutor bishops (who may, in turn, be elected as a fixed number, as happens in the Church of England). Houses of Bishops of Anglican Communion provinces are typically chaired by the Primate, Archbishop, or Presiding Bishop of the province, while in some provincial subdivisions of a Communion province, a House of Bishops is chaired by a provincial metropolitan. ==See also== * General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada * General Synod of the Church of England **House of Bishops (Church of England) ==References== ==External links== *House of Bishops and Deputies email list from the USA *Pastoral letters from the House of Bishops of the American Episcopal Church from Project Canterbury Category:Church of England Category:Governing assemblies of religious organizations ",
