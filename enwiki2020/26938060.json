It is the political vehicle of its leader, televangelist Eddie Villanueva. Villanueva ran for president on 2004 and 2010, but lost on both elections. The party put up a senatorial slate for the 2010 elections but none of its candidates won. Villanueva's son, Eduardo \"Jon-Jon\" Villanueva, Jr. was the highest ranking elected official of the party, serving as mayor of Bocaue, Bulacan; he ran as the Liberal Party's candidate for mayor in the 2013 elections and won. In the 2016 Senate election, the party endorsed another Villanueva son, then TESDA Director General Joel Villanueva. He won the second highest number of votes in that election. ==Candidates for Philippine general elections, 2010== *Eddie Villanueva- Presidential Candidate *Perfecto R.
