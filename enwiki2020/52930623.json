He has published extensively on the history of the country, both in scholarly journals and in popular publications such as The New Statesman, The Listener, The Spectator, The London Review of Books and The Times. In the early 1990s, he served as an advisor to President C\u00e9sar Gaviria; his work there earned him the Cruz de Boyac\u00e1 from Colombia, and an OBE from the British government.
