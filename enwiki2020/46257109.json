    "text": "The San Miguel Arcangel Parish Church, commonly referred to as Orion Church, is a 19th-century, Baroque church located at Brgy. San Vicente, Orion, Bataan, Philippines. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Michael, the Archangel, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga. A marker bearing the brief history of the structure has been installed in its fa\u00e7ade by the National Historical Committee, precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. ==Parish and Architectural History== Orion was established by the Dominican Priests on April 30, 1667. The present-day 19th- century church was built by Father Jose Campomanes, OP after an earthquake in 1852 which destroyed the previous structure. ==Architecture and Ornamentation== ===Exterior=== The church fa\u00e7ade is of barn-style Baroque, a style that has been described as typically found in most Spanish-era churches in the Philippines. It features side pillars capped by urn-like finials, pilasters that divide the fa\u00e7ade into five segments and cornices that divide the expanse of the wall into two levels. The pediment is semi-arched and ends into two small volutes before tapering down to the sides. It is adorned by a framed saint's niche flanked by two hexagonal windows. A concrete porte cochere has been added later into the structure. To the left of the church rises the four-level, slender belfry. The two uppermost levels are octagonal and are pierced with rectangular, circular and semicircular arched campanile windows. ===Interior=== 18th century altarpiece featuring the seven archangels and a tableau of the Holy Family The main altarpiece or retablo, which was done in the early 18th century, is done in Rococo style. ==See also== * Roman Catholicism in the Philippines * Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga * Balanga Cathedral ==References== ==External links== * * Official Website of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bataan Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines Category:Baroque architecture in the Philippines ",
