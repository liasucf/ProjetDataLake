He was born in Herat, where he received his basic Islamic education. Thereafter, he traveled to Mecca and studied under the scholar Shaykh Ahmad Ibn Hajar al-Haytami Makki, and al-Qari eventually decided to remain in Mecca where he taught, died and was buried. He is considered in Hanafi circles to be one of the masters of hadith and imams of fiqh, Qur'anic commentary, language, history and tasawwuf. He was a hafiz (memorizer of the Quran) and a famous calligrapher who wrote a Quran by hand every year. Al-Qari wrote several books, including the commentary al-Mirqat on Mishkat al-Masabih in several volumes, a two-volume commentary on Qadi Ayyad's Ash-Shifa, a commentary on the Shama'il al-Tirmidhi, and a two-volume commentary on Al-Ghazali's abridgment of the Ihya Ulum ad-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) entitled `Ayn al-`Ilm wa Zayn al-Hilm (The spring of knowledge and the adornment of understanding). He also wrote Daw' al-Ma'ali Sharh Bad' al-Amali (), an exposition of Qasida Bad' al-Amali by Siraj al-Din al-Ushi. His most popular work is a collection of prayers (dua), taken from the Quran and the Hadith, called Hizb ul-Azam. The collection is divided into seven chapters, giving one chapter for each day of the week. This work is sometimes found in a collection with the Dalail al-Khayrat. ==See also== * List of Hanafis * List of Muslim theologians * List of Ash'aris and Maturidis * List of Islamic scholars ==References== Category:Hanafis Category:Maturidis Category:Muslim theologians Category:Hadith scholars Category:Sunni imams Category:Sunni fiqh scholars Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Sunni Sufis Category:People from Herat Category:1605 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:16th-century jurists Category:17th-century jurists ",
