A number of different Housemates, celebrities with different degrees of fame, are locked up together in a house, where the viewing public can watch them and vote them out of the House as they choose to. The housemates live in isolation from the outside world in a house custom built with everyday objects, like fridges and a garden. The house also includes cameras and microphones in most of the rooms to record all of the activity in the house. The only place where Housemates can be away from the other contestants is in the Diary Room, where they can express their true feelings. The winner is the last contestant remaining in the house and receives a large cash prize. Housemates are evicted weekly throughout the show by the viewing public. ==Season details== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:left; line-height:20px;\" |- ! Season !
