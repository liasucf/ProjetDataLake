He was also Lord Mayor and later High Sheriff of Dublin CityBoylan, John (1998) Dictionary of Irish Biography p.153, 3rd.ed. and became a strong supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. == Early life and family == Gray was born on 29 December 1845 in Dublin, the second son of Sir John Gray and his wife Anna Dwyer. After receiving his education, he joined his father in managing the Freeman's Journal, the oldest nationalist newspaper in Ireland. When his father died in 1875, Gray took over proprietorship of the Journal, and his family's other newspaper properties such as the Belfast Morning News and the Dublin Evening Telegraph.G. B. Smith, 'Gray, Edmund Dwyer (1845\u20131888)\u2019, rev. Alan O'Day, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2006, accessed 7 May 2008. In 1868, Gray saved five people from drowning in a wrecked schooner at Killiney Bay, an action for which he received the Tayleur Fund Gold Medal for bravery from the Royal Humane Society. By coincidence, the rescue was witnessed by his future wife, Caroline Agnes Gray, whom he would meet shortly afterwards.Edmund Dwyer Gray Album, NUACHT Leabharlann N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann (National Library of Ireland NEWS), Spring 2005. Agnes was the daughter of Caroline Chisholm (an English humanitarian renowned for her work in female immigrant welfare in Australia), and although Gray was descended from a Protestant family, he converted to Catholicism to marry her. The wedding in London on 17 July 1869 was conducted by the Bishop of Northampton. The couple had one son, Edmund Dwyer-Gray, who would take over from his father as proprietor of his newspapers and would go on to become Premier of Tasmania. == Political career == From 1875 to 1883, Gray served as a member of the Dublin Corporation, and in 1880 served a term as Lord Mayor of Dublin. Unusually for an Irish nationalist politician, Gray was very much focussed on urban rather than rural affairs, and like his father was heavily involved in public health and water provision for Dublin. He also promoted reform in the municipal health system. Gray unsuccessfully ran for his father's seat of Kilkenny City at Westminster in the 1875 by-election that followed Sir John Gray's death. He won a later by-election in 1877, becoming a Member of Parliament representing Tipperary for the Home Rule League. At the 1880 general election, he won the seat of Carlow County. At the 1885 election, as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he won representation of both Carlow and the new constituency of Dublin St Stephen's Green, and chose to represent the latter.

He was imprisoned for six weeks in 1882 for remarks made in the Freeman's Journal with regard to the composition of the jury in the case of a murder trial. (Gray was actually High Sheriff of the City of Dublin at the time of his imprisonment, and \u2013 because of the conflict of office \u2013 was taken into custody by the city coroner.)\"Dublin people excited; The Hon. E. Dwyer Gray imprisoned for contempt\" New York Times 17 August 1882 The defendant in the case in question was later hanged. A heavy drinker and asthma sufferer, Gray died aged 42 after a short illness on 27 March 1888, and was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. == References == == External links == * Category:1845 births Category:1888 deaths Category:19th-century Irish people Edmund Category:Burials at Glasnevin Cemetery Category:Home Rule League MPs Category:Irish newspaper editors Category:Irish Parliamentary Party MPs Category:Lord Mayors of Dublin Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Carlow constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Dublin constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Tipperary constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:UK MPs 1874\u20131880 Category:UK MPs 1880\u20131885 Category:UK MPs 1885\u20131886 Category:UK MPs 1886\u20131892 Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:High Sheriffs of Dublin City ",
