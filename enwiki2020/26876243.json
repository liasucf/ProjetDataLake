Their style consists of a combination of melodic death and black metal with influences from other styles of metal like heavy, thrash, speed and classical music. ==History== The Bulgarian symphonic progressive/black metal band Claymore was formed in the summer of 1999 in the city of Ruse. Founding members are Kamen Manev (drums), Martin Manev (guitar). Choosing the keyboard was complex and after three months of auditions Tsvetelin Baltov was chosen for keyboards: he became one of the pillars of Claymore. After a number of changes over the years, the current staff is: Martin - guitar; Kamen - drums; Tsvetelin - keyboards, Emil - vocals and bass. Claymore quickly became popular among Bulgarian fans with unique and pure style of symphonic progressive/black metal combining aggression and melody in one with influences from other styles like heavy, thrash, death, grind, pagan as well as a good amount of classical music. Their first ever performance is in September 1999 to start a long tour in many cities across Bulgaria . This earns them a place at the biggest Bulgarian Underground Music Festival (Bourgas 2000). At the end of 2000 Claymore recorded their first demo tracks quickly followed by a demo CD titled \"Warriors of Claymore\" which is posted on many web magazines and played on radio shows in Bulgaria and abroad. During 2002 Claymore worked hard on the sound quality for the recording of the actual demo \"Released\" consisting of 5 songs. These songs represent their style and part of their live shows. Claymore's remarkable popularity and success earns them a place in \"Trash till Death 2005,2006\", \"Heatework festival 2006\", \"Heart Rock festival 2008\", \"Black Curs Fest 2008\", \"Legacy Open Air Fest 2009\", \"Barock Fest 2009\", \"Ost festival 2012\", \"Sea Black Festival 2013\", \"Urpin Fest 2014\" etc., where they played alongside well-known international bands like Destruction, Dimmu Borgir, Primordial, Napalm Death, Sinister, Lord Belial, Graveworm, Eastern Front, Exumer, Negura Bunget, Izegrim, Spoil Engine, Zombie INC, etc. Claymore recorded their first full-length album Prolonged Active Antagonism and took part in \"Black Curse Over Europe\" tour in 2008. The album is out on D.O.P. (Bulgaria). Official mp3 distributors are Forces of Satan (Norway), Toxicity Records \u2013 Vodafone Live (Bulgaria). They want to spread their music among the Underground circles all over the world. That actually happens - completion of the second album \"Vengeance is Near\" led to a deal with the Japanese label Red Rivet Records great step in the progress of the band . Included is the song \"Centuries of chaos part II\" compilation magazine TERRORIZER issue 247 After much effort, the band realized another dream: In 2014, CLAYMORE make his first European tour \"Vengenace is Near\" which passes through Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria.
