Its first full-length episode was released on October 31, 2017. New episodes were released weekly until the second season, when they were released every two weeks.

After that, the hosts create a mixed drink that is connected to the disease, called a 'Quarantini'. This segment is generally referred to as 'Quarantini time'. After this introduction, the biology of the disease is explained, then history, epidemiology, and finally, the disease's effect on the modern world. Generally, Welsh tells the history of the disease and Updyke explains the biology epidemiology. Finally, the hosts cite the sources used to present the information, and supply a link to their website where the sources can be found. == History == Erin Allmann Updyke, co-host, has both an M.S. from The University of Hawaii and a Ph.D. from University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign in epidemiology. Erin Welsh, co-host, has a M.S. in epidemiology from the University of Louisville and a Ph.D. in ecology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"The Erins\", as they've coined themselves, started \"This Podcast Will Kill You\" because they felt that the medical knowledge that they have gained from their education rarely transfers out of the academia world. They wanted to make medical knowledge more accessible and easier to understand to the general public, without diluting it. Their first episode aired on October 31, 2017. In 2018, prior to launching Season 2, \"This Podcast Will Kill You\" joined The Exactly Right Network. In doing so, their downloads rose four times. There are currently three seasons and one mini- series about COVID-19. == List of Episodes == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Season !Date !Episode !Title |- |1 |October 23, 2017 |0 |Trailer |- |1 |October 31, 2017 |1 |Influenza Will Kill You |- |1 |November 7, 2017 |2 |Skin in the Game, Horse in the Race |- |1 |November 14, 2017 |3 |Gnarlypox |- |1 |November 21, 2017 |4 |The Poop Show |- |1 |November 28, 2017 |5 |Plague Part I: The GMOAT |- |1 |December 5, 3017 |6 |Plague Part II: TGFA |- |1 |December 12, 2017 |7 |Hit Me With Your Best (Polio) Shot |- |1 |December 19, 2017 |8 |ABRACADABRA - Go Away Malaria! |- |1 |January 2, 2018 |9 |Tuberculosis: A Slow Burn |- |1 |January 9, 2018 |10 |Yellow Fever: Is there a Hamilton song about this? |- |1 |January 16, 2018 |11 |Ebola: The New Kid on the Block |- |1 |January 23, 2018 |12 |HIV/AIDS: Apathy Will Kill You |- |1 |January 30, 2018 |13 |Bonus Episode: HIV/AIDS |- |1 |February 27, 2018 | |Don't Tread on my Monkshood: Crossover w/ IDOP |- |2 |November 27, 2018 |14 |Rabies, Don't dilute me, bro |- |2 |December 11, 2018 |15 |MRSA: Make resistance Susceptible Again |- |2 |December 24, 2018 |16 |Scratch and Sniff Diphtheria Membrane |- |2 |January 8, 2019 |17 |Oh No Tetrodo: Crossover w/ TBOSP |- |2 |January 22, 2019 |18 |Hantavirus: The Real Rat Race |- |2 |February 5, 2019 |19 |Scurvy: Thanks a lot, evolution |- |2 |February 20, 2019 |20 |Prions: Apocalypse Cow |- |2 |March 5, 2019 |21 |Measles: The Worst Souvenir |- |2 |March 19, 2019 |22 |Belladonna will dilate your mind: Crossover w/ IDOP |- |2 |April 2, 2019 |23 |Opening a can of Hookworms |- |2 |April 16, 2019 |24 |Zika: Rumors and Rumours |- |2 |April 30, 2019 |25 |Put your hands together for: Gonorrhea! |- |2 |May 16, 2019 |26 |Vaccines Part I: Let's hear it for Maurice |- |2 |May 21, 2019 |27 |Vaccines Part II: Have you thanks your immune system lately? |- |2 |May 28, 2019 |28 |H.pylori: Don't try this at home |- |2 |June 11, 2019 |29 |Aspirin the Wonder Drug: Crossover w/ IDOP |- |2 |June 25, 2019 |30 |Encephalitis Lethargica: Sleep Perchance to Dream (& Dream & Dream) |- |2 |July 9, 2019 |31 |Giardia: Gerardia |- |2 |July 23, 2019 |32 |Ask the Erins |- |2 |August 6, 2019 |33 |Chytrid: The Silent Forest |- |2 |August 20, 2019 |34 |Cystic Fibrosis: Complete Somatic Rebellion |- |2 |September 3, 2019 |35 |Lyme Disease: I'd like to check you for ticks |- |3 |October 29, 2019 |36 |Shades of Syphilis |- |3 |November 12, 2019 |37 |E. coli (unless it's beets) |- |3 |November 26, 2019 |38 |Lead Poisoning: Heavy Metal Episode |- |3 |December 10, 2019 |39 |Toxoplasmosis: Calling All Cats |- |3 |December 24, 2019 |40 |Dancing Plague: Worst Dance Party Ever |- |3 |January 7, 2020 |41 |Ricin: A Bad Seed (crossover with IDOP) |- |3 |January 21, 2020 |42 |Dandy Dengue Fever |- |3 |February 4, 2020 |43 |M-m-m-my Coronaviruses |- |3 |February 18, 2020 |44 |Pertussis: Whoop Here It Is |- |3 |March 3, 2020 |45 |Hepatitis C: Hepatiti? |- |3 |March 17, 2020 |46 |Lactose Intolerance: Never trust a fart |- |3 |March 31, 2020 |47 |Schistosomiasis: A Snail's Pace |- |3 |April 14, 2020 |48 |Botulism: Why are you the way you are? |- |3 |April 28, 2020 |49 |Eastern Equine Encephalitis: Triple EEEk! |- |3 |May 12, 2020 |50 |Antibiotics: We owe it all to chemistry! |- |3 |May 26, 2020 |51 |The Path of Most (Antibiotic) Resistance |- |3 |June 23, 2020 |52 |Rinderpest: Moo Cows, Moo Problems |- |3 |July 7, 2020 |53 |Radiation: X-Ray Marks the Spot |} To discuss the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the podcast introduced \"The Anatomy of a Pandemic\" series in which each episode tackles a particular aspect of COVID-19.
