KBDB-FM is the only commercial radio station serving the West End of Clallam County, Washington. The studios are at 260 Cedar Avenue in Forks. The station's transmitter was located next to the studios until early 2016. Because of its low-lying position in relation to the surrounding mountainous terrain\u2014the antenna was 23 meters (75.5 feet) below average terrain\u2014the 6,000 watt Class A signal barely reached beyond the valley. In the spring of 2016, KBDB-FM began broadcasting a Class C3 signal from a mountaintop transmitter located approximately 5.5 km (3.4 miles) north-northwest of Sappho. ==References== *Marketwire - Nov 19, 2012 ==External links== BDB-FM Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Washington (state) ",
