His work tends to be fairly conservative in style, with a strong rhythmic element. His pieces include six symphonies; a number of concertos, including two for violin,. one for marimba and orchestra (premiered by Ruth Stuber), one for one piano, one for two pianos, one for accordion and one for alto saxophone (the latter dedicated to Cecil Leeson); a fantasia for trombone and orchestra (composed for and premiered by Robert Marsteller). Also for alto saxophone he wrote a Rapsodie for Jean-Marie Londeix; a suite (1935) and a sonata (Op. 19, 1939), both dedicated to Cecil LeesonLiley, Thomas, \"The Repertoire Heritage\", in Ingham, Richard (1998). , pages 55, 57.

Several of his works were inspired by the poetry of Walt Whitman. He died in Poway, California, a suburb of San Diego. Creston was one of the most performed American composers of the 1940s and 1950s.
