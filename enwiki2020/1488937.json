    "text": "The Sir Julius Vogel Awards are awarded each year at the New Zealand National Science Fiction Convention to recognise achievement in New Zealand science fiction, fantasy, horror, and science fiction fandom. They are commonly referred to as the Vogels. ==Name== Sir Julius Vogel, 8th Prime Minister of New Zealand. The awards are named for Sir Julius Vogel, a prominent New Zealand journalist and politician, who was Premier of New Zealand twice during the 1870s. He also, in 1889, wrote what is widely regarded as New Zealand's first science fiction novel, Anno Domini 2000, or, Woman's Destiny.\"Curiosities: Anno Domini 2000; or Woman's Destiny by Julius Vogel\" by Lucy Sussex, Fantasy and Science Fiction, December 2008, page 162. The book, written and published in Great Britain after Vogel had moved from New Zealand, pictured a New Zealand in the year 2000 where most positions of authority were held by women\u2014at the time of writing, a radical proposition. In 2000, New Zealand's Head of State, Governor General, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Attorney General were all women, as was the CEO of one of the country's largest companies, Telecom. ==History== National awards have been presented annually since 1989, but were initially simply known as the New Zealand Science Fiction Fan Awards, and were originally aimed primarily at fandom rather than at professional science fiction. In these early years the awards were organised on an ad-hoc basis by the organising committees of the national conventions, though with the support of the former national fan organisation, the National Association for Science Fiction which nominally ran the awards from 1993. In the early 1990s the awards were briefly known as the Edmund Bayne Awards, after a well-known Wellington fan who had been killed in a road accident, but this name was never formalised. In 2002 the awards were revamped and reorganised, and since that time have been aimed more at the professional science fiction and fantasy community. The current name also dates to 2002. These changes accompanied a change in the organisation of the awards, which are now formally run by national organisation SFFANZ (the Science Fiction and Fantasy Association of New Zealand). Categories change to some extent on an annual basis, but generally include professional awards for best novel, short story, dramatic presentation, and services to science fiction, as well as equivalent fan awards. Due to the size of New Zealand's science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction communities, the awards cover all three of these frequently intertwined genres and attempt to treat each equally. ==New Zealand science fiction fan award winners 1989-2001== ;1989 *Best fan writing: Alan Robson *Best fanzine: Phlogiston *Best fan art: Dan McCarthy *Best fan editor: Alex Heatley :Numerous other one-off awards were made in these debut awards ;1990 *Best fan writing (general): Alan Robson *Best fan writing (media): Lana Brown *Best fanzine: Cry Havoc *Best media fanzine: Katra *Best fan art: Peter Gainsford *Best fan editor: Lyn McConchie ;1991 *Best fan writing: Alan Robson *Best fanzine: Phlogiston *Best fan art: Dan McCarthy *Best fan editor: Alex Heatley ;1992 *Best fan writing: Alan Robson *Best fanzine: Phlogiston *Best fan art (tie): James Benson and Mike Hanson *Best fan editor (tie): James Dignan and Alex Heatley ;1993 *Best fan writing: Jon Preddle *Best general fanzine: Timestreams *Best club fanzine: Time Space Visualiser *Best fan art: Warwick Gray *Special achievement: Lana Brown ;1994 *Best fan writing: Anne Marie Lloyd *Best fanzine: Chunder *Best fan art: Mark Roach *Best other publication: Trimmings from the Triffid's Beard ;1995 *Best fan writing: Peter Friend and Li Cross (co-authors) *Best fanzine: Time Space Visualiser *Best fan art: Warwick Gray *Best other publication: The Best of Time Space Visualiser 21-26 *Special achievement: Continuum convention committee ;1996 *Best fan writing: Peter Friend *Best fanzine: Phoenixine *Best fan art: Nick Kim ;1997-2000 (details unknown) ;2001 *Best fan writing: Jon Preddle *Best fanzine: Phoenixine *Best fan art: Richard Manx *Services to fandom: Paul Scoones ==Professional award winners since 2002== ;2002 *Best Novel: First Hunter by Dale Elvy *Best Short Story: \"The Good Earth\" by Peter Friend *Dramatic Presentation - Long Form: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring *Best New Talent: Dale Elvy *Services to Science Fiction and Fantasy: Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Phillipa Boyens ;2003 *Best Novel: Beast Master\u2019s Ark by Andre Norton and Lyn McConchie *Best Art Work: John Baster, Mary Maclachlan *Services to Science Fiction and Fantasy: Weta Workshop, Weta Digital ;2004 *Best Novel: Dark Shinto by Dale Elvy *Best Short Story (tie): \"A Plea for Help\" by Kevin G Maclean and \"The Alchemist\" by Peter Friend *Best New Talent: Glynne Maclean *Special Award: Peter Jackson and the team responsible for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy ;2005 *Best Novel: Beastmaster\u2019s Circus by Lyn McConchie and Andre Norton *Best Short Story: \"When Dragons Dream\u201d by Kevin G Maclean *Services to Science Fiction and Fantasy: Ken Catran ;2006 *Best Novel: The Duke's Ballad by Andre Norton and Lyn McConchie *Best Short Story: \"The Real Deal\u201d by Peter Friend *Services to Science Fiction and Fantasy: Margaret Mahy ;2007 *Best Novel: The Assassin of Gleam by James Norcliffe *Best Short Story: \"Western Front, 1914\u201d by Peter Friend *Best Dramatic Presentation - Long Form: Maddigan's Quest *Best New Talent: Douglas A.
