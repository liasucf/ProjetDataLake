    "text": "The 900 class were a class of diesel locomotives built by Islington Railway Workshops for the South Australian Railways between 1951 and 1953. ==History== The 900 class were the first main line diesels operated by the South Australian Railways. Ten were built at Islington Railway Workshops to replace steam locomotives on the heavily graded Mount Lofty Ranges. They operated both heavy freight trains and passenger services including The Overland. After the arrival of more powerful diesels, they were concentrated on the easier graded lines from Adelaide to Port Pirie and Peterborough. In March 1978 all were included in the transfer of the South Australian Railways to Australian National. Withdrawals commenced in May 1979 with the last two withdrawn on 18 June 1985 after operating a cement train from Angaston to Dry Creek.\"South Australia\" Railway Digest August 1985 page 247Broad Gauge 900-class diesel locomotives Chris' Commonwealth Railway Pages Three have been preserved with the other seven scrapped.900 Class Railpage ==Preserved== Three units have been preserved: *900 Lady Norrie resides at the National Railway Museum, Port AdelaideLady Norrie National Railway Museum *907 resides in Tailem Bend under private ownership in derelict conditionThe Tailem Bend Train Graveyard Weekend Notes 10 February 2013 *909 resides in Tailem Bend under private ownership being standard gauge converted ==References== English Electric brochure TD120 https://www.flickr.com/photos/29903115@N06/6747430491 900 class drivers cab Two 900 class locomotives Category:A1A-A1A locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1951 900 Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:5 ft 3 in gauge locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Australia Category:English Electric locomotives ",
