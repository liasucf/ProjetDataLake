    "text": "Central European Time (CET), used in most parts of Europe and a few North African countries, is a standard time which is 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time offset from UTC can be written as UTC+01:00. The same standard time, UTC+01:00, is also known as Middle European Time (MET, German: MEZ) and under other names like Berlin Time, Warsaw Time, Paris Time or Rome Time. The 15th meridian east is the central axis for UTC+01:00 in the world system of time zones. As of 2011, all member states of the European Union observe summer time; those that during the winter use CET use Central European Summer Time (CEST) (or: UTC+02:00, daylight saving time) in summer (from last Sunday of March to last Sunday of October). A number of African countries use UTC+01:00 all year long, where it is called West Africa Time (WAT), although Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia also use the term Central European Time. == Usage == === Usage in Europe === The monument 'The 15th Meridian' in Stargard, Poland ==== Current usage ==== Central European Time is currently (updated 2017)CET \u2013 Central European Time / European Central Time (Standard Time) used in Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo*, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain (except Canary Islands), Sweden and Switzerland. ==== History ==== * 1884 ** Serbia starts using CET. * 1 October 1891 ** Austro-Hungarian Empire adopts CET. At first railways and post offices, cities such as Prague and Budapest, but not Vienna. (present-day Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and some other regions) * 1 April 1893 ** The German Empire unified its time zones to use CET (MEZ). ** Italy, Malta use CET. ** Vienna (then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire) starts using CET. * 1894 ** Switzerland switches from UTC+00:30 to CET ** Liechtenstein introduces CET. ** Denmark adopts CET. * 1895 ** Norway adopts CET. * 1900 ** Sweden adopts CET. * 1904 ** Luxembourg introduces CET, but leaves 1918. * 1914 ** Albania adopts CET. * 1914-1918 ** During World War I CET was implemented in all German-occupied territories. * 1920 ** Lithuania adopts CET (but subsequently rescinded in 1940) and 1998\u22121999 again. * 1922 ** Poland adopts CET. * 1940 ** Under German occupation: *** The Netherlands was switched from UTC+00:20 to CET. *** Belgium was switched from UTC+00:00. *** Luxembourg was switched from UTC+00:00. *** France, which had adopted Paris time on 14 March 1891 and Greenwich Mean Time on 9 March 1911, was switched to CET. ** Spain switched to CET. After World War II Monaco, Andorra and Gibraltar implemented CET. Portugal used CET in the years 1966-1976 and 1992-1996\\. ;United Kingdom The time around the world is based on Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) which is roughly synonymous with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). From late March to late October, clocks in the United Kingdom are put forward by one hour for British Summer Time (BST). Since 1997, most of the European Union aligned with the British standards for BST. In 1968 there was a three-year experiment called British Standard Time, when the UK and Ireland experimentally employed British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year round; clocks were put forward in March 1968 and not put back until October 1971. Central European Time is sometimes referred to as continental time in the UK. === Other countries === Several African countries use UTC+01:00 all year long, where it called West Africa Time (WAT), although Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also use the term Central European Time, despite being located in North Africa. Between 2005 and 2008, Tunisia observed daylight saving time. Libya also used CET during the years 1951-1959, 1982-1989, 1996-1997 and 2012-2013\\.

The CET time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 7\u00b030\u2032 E and 22\u00b030\u2032 E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a \"physical\" or \"nominal\" UTC+01:00 time, actually use another time zone (UTC+02:00 in particular \u2013 there are no \"physical\" UTC+01:00 areas that employ UTC+00:00). Conversely, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+01:00, even though their \"physical\" time zone is UTC (typically), UTC\u221201:00 (westernmost Spain), or UTC+02:00 (e.g. the very easternmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Poland and Serbia). On the other hand, the people in Spain still have all work and meal hours one hour later than France and Germany even if they have the same time zone. Following is a list of such \"incongruences\": Historically Gibraltar maintained UTC+01:00 all year until the opening of the land frontier with Spain in 1982 when it followed its neighbour and introduced CEST. === Areas located within UTC+01:00 longitudes using other time zones === These areas are located between 7\u00b030\u2032 E and 22\u00b030\u2032 E (\"physical\" UTC+1) ==== Areas using UTC+02:00 ==== * The westernmost part of Greece, including the cities of Patras, Ioannina and the island of Corfu * The westernmost parts of the Bulgarian provinces of Vidin and Kyustendil * The westernmost part of Romania, including most of the area of the counties of Cara\u0219-Severin, Timi\u0219 (capital Timi\u0219oara), Arad, and Bihor, as well as the westernmost tips of the counties of Mehedin\u021bi and Satu Mare * The westernmost tip of Ukraine, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia, at the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), essentially comprising the city of Uzhhorod and its environs.

The green area is the Finnish part of the Rybachi peninsula (Kalastajasaarento) which was ceded to the Soviet Union after the Winter War. The Red area is the J\u00e4niskoski-Niskakoski area ceded to the USSR in 1947. * The easternmost part of North Macedonia, including the city of Strumica * The easternmost part of Serbia, in the Pirot District, including the city of Pirot, and small easternmost parts of Bor District. * The easternmost tips of Hungary and Slovakia, bordering to the north and south respectively the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), a bit to the east of V\u00e1s\u00e1rosnam\u00e9ny, Hungary \u2013 Uzhhorod, Ukraine (both at 22\u00b018\u2032 E) line * The easternmost part of Poland, including the cities of Lublin and Bia\u0142ystok * The northeast of Sweden, in the Norrbotten province, including the cities of Kalix and Haparanda * The northeast of Norway, lying north of Finland, roughly coinciding with the county of Finnmark. The easternmost town in Norway, Vard\u00f8, lies at 30\u00b051\u2032 E, which is so far east, so as to be east even of the central meridian of EET (UTC+02:00), i.e. east of Istanbul and Alexandria. The sun reaches its highest point at 10:56 (when not DST), although the sun does not vary so much in height at the latitude 70\u00b0N. The Norwegian\u2013Russian and the Polish-Belarussian border are the only places where CET (UTC+1/+2) borders Moscow time (UTC+03:00), resulting in a two hours time change (or one hour in summer) for the travellers crossing that border. * There is a \"tri-zone\" point (where UTC+01:00, UTC+02:00, and UTC+03:00 meet, winter times) at the Norway\u2013Finland\u2013Russia tripoint near Muotkavaara. During the summer Finland and Russia both have UTC+03:00. == See also == * Summer Time in Europe * Other countries and territories in UTC+1 time zone == References == == External links == *German Time Act *Dutch Time Act *List of countries using CET (Central European Time) Category:Time zones Category:Time in Europe Category:Geography of Central Europe ",
