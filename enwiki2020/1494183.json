The LASSO service automatically recognizes CDs, DVDs, and digital audio files in formats such as MP3, WMA, and others. The service uses CD table of contents (ToC), DVD ToC, and acoustic fingerprint based recognition to recognize media. LASSO is available in versions for PCs and embedded devices. LASSO competes with user submitted services like freedb, Gracenote, MusicBrainz, and Discogs. ==See also== *List of online music databases ==External links== *Macrovision's LASSO Product Page (using AMG data) Category:Online music and lyrics databases Category:Acoustic fingerprinting ",
