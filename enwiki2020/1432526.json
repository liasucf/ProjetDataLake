    "text": "Sha Na Na is an American rock and roll doo-wop group. Performing a song-and- dance repertoire based on 1950s hit songs, Sha Na Na has been simultaneously reviving and parodying the music of 1950s New York street culture since the group's formation in 1969. After gaining initial fame for their performance at Woodstock, made possible with the help of their friend Jimi Hendrix, the group hosted Sha Na Na, a syndicated variety series that ran from 1977 to 1981. Billing themselves as \"from the streets of New York\", members were frequently outfitted in gold lam\u00e9 or leather jackets, and sporting pompadour or ducktail hairdos. The group's name is taken from a series of nonsense syllables (\"Sha Na Na Na Sha Na Na Na Na\") in the song \"Get a Job\", originally recorded by the Silhouettes. The current lineup features original members Donny York and Jocko Marcellino, as well as longtime member Screamin' Scott Simon, who joined in 1970. Everyone else from the original band and TV show has since departed. Current band members include bassist Tim Butler, guitarist Randy Hill, drummer Ty Cox, and sax player Michael Brown. ==Career== The group began singing as part of the long-standing Columbia University a cappella group the Kingsmen, but changed their name due to the Pacific Northwest group of the same name that became famous for recording \"Louie, Louie\". Conceived by George Leonard, then a graduate student in humanities, Sha Na Na began performing in 1969 at the height of the hippie counterculture, and achieved national fame after playing at the Woodstock Festival, where Rob Leonard, the president and bass singer of the band, sang the lead on \u201cTeen Angel\u201d when the band opened for their friend Jimi Hendrix. Their 90-second appearance in the Woodstock film brought the group national attention and helped spark a 1950s nostalgia craze that inspired similar groups (Flash Cadillac, Showaddywaddy, Big Daddy), as well as the Broadway musical Grease (and its feature film adaptation), the feature film American Graffiti and the TV show Happy Days. The group's first manager, Ed Goodgold, codified trivia as a nostalgic quiz game and conducted the nation's first trivia contests with Dan Carlinsky in 1965. The future Sha Na Na/Kingsmen were featured singers at these contests. Four years later, he co-authored \"Rock 'n' Roll Trivia\" just as he and the William Morris Agency began steering Sha Na Na's career. From 1969 until 1971, the band played at, among other places, the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, opening for such bands as the Grateful Dead, the Mothers of Invention, and the Kinks.Amalie R. Rothschild, Live at the Fillmore East, 1999 Thunder's Mouth Press When Sha Na Na began headlining at other venues, one of their opening acts was Bruce Springsteen.Marc Dolan, Bruce Springsteen and the Promise of Rock 'N Roll, 2012, W.W. Norton & Co. In 1972, Sha Na Na was one of just four acts invited by John Lennon and Yoko Ono to perform with them at their One-to-One benefit concert at Madison Square Garden. Subsequently, the group appeared in the 1978 movie Grease, and from 1977 to 1982, the group reached perhaps the height of its success with its own hit syndicated television show Sha Na Na, featuring guest musicians such as James Brown, the punk rock band the Ramones, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, the Ronettes, and Chubby Checker. The original band line-up featured 12 performers: Robert A. Leonard (Rob Leonard) (bass vocals), Alan Cooper (bass vocals), Frederick \"Dennis\" Greene (Denny) (vocals), Henry Gross (guitar), Jocko Marcellino (drums), Joe Witkin (piano), Scott Powell (also known as Captain Outrageous and Tony Santini) (vocals), Donald \"Donny\" York (vocals), Elliot \"Gino\" Cahn (rhythm guitar), Rich Joffe (vocals), Dave Garrett (vocals) and Bruce \"Bruno\" Clarke (electric bass). The initial act had three up-front performers in gold lam\u00e9 and the other nine in \"greaser\" attire (rolled up T-shirt sleeves, leather jackets, tank tops). On their album The Golden Age of Rock and Roll, the lead singer taunts the audience on one of the live tracks by announcing, \"We've got just one thing to say to you fuckin' hippies, and that is that rock and roll is here to stay!\" The act usually ended after several encores, and closed with \"Lovers Never Say Goodbye\". The closing song was changed to \"Goodnight Sweetheart\" for the TV series. In concert, they would often return for up to seven encores, and this included when performing in Toronto, at Ontario Place and performing \"Hound Dog\" after announcing Elvis Presley's death earlier that same day (August 16, 1977). ==TV series== Sha Na Na hosted the Sha Na Na syndicated variety series that ran from 1977 to 1981. It was among the most watched programs in syndication during its run.The Complete Directory of Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows. 8th Edition \u2013 2003, Ballantine Books. The show was produced by Pierre Cossette and originally distributed by LBS Communications. The show featured the group performing hits from the 1950s and 1960s, along with comedy skits. The \"tough guys\" road act from their original road shows was adapted for TV and the group moved to a comedy and self-deprecating routine. The mainstay continued to be the 1950s song and dance routines. The show opened in a typical concert scene, and then moved through various street and ice cream parlor scenes where they and their guests performed several songs. That was followed by a comedy-oriented song (\"Alley Oop\", \"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah\") and closed with a slow song, again in their concert format. Among the supporting members featured in the series were Avery Schreiber, Kenneth Mars and Philip Roth (all of them in the first season); both Pamela Myers and actress Jane Dulo (the crabby Lady in the Window, who watched over the street scenes from her apartment with undisguised disdain) throughout the show's run, June Gable and Soupy Sales (seasons 2 to 4); Michael Sklar (season 2); and Karen Hartman (season 4). Guests included Jan & Dean, Fabian, Chubby Checker, the Ramones, Ethel Merman, Frank Gorshin, Billy Crystal, Danny and the Juniors, Rita Moreno and others. The members of Sha Na Na during the TV series were Jon \"Bowzer\" Bauman (vocals), Lennie Baker (sax/vocals), Johnny Contardo (vocals), Frederick \"Dennis\" Greene (vocals), Danny \"Dirty Dan\" McBride (guitar/vocals) (left after third season), Jocko Marcellino (drums/vocals), Dave \"Chico\" Ryan (bass/vocals), 'Screamin' Scott Simon (piano/vocals), Scott \"Santini\" Powell (vocals), Donald \"Donny\" York (vocals). Every member was featured with a solo vocal spot during the course of the series. Each was introduced only by his nickname or his first name in a voice-over by Myers at the beginning of each show. ==Film== The group appear as themselves in the documentaries Woodstock (1970) and Festival Express (2003). Sha Na Na also appeared in the 1978 film Grease (an adaptation of the 1971 Broadway musical of the same name) as a 1950s band called Johnny Casino and the Gamblers. Their tracks on the film and Grease soundtrack include two songs from the original 1971 musical: \"Those Magic Changes\" and \"Born to Hand Jive\"; as well as four songs from the early rock and roll era: versions of Elvis Presley's covers of \"Hound Dog\" (1956) and \"Blue Moon\" (1956), a cover of the Imperials' \"Tears on My Pillow\" (1958), and a cover of Danny & the Juniors' \"Rock & Roll Is Here to Stay\" (1958). The song \"Sandy\" sung by John Travolta in the film, was co- written specifically for the film by Sha Na Na's Screamin' Scott Simon. ==Members== In alphabetical order ;Current members * Donald York, a.k.a. \"Donny\" (1969\u2013present): original vocalist * Gene Jaramillo (2006\u2013present): guitarist; replaced Buzz Campbell * John Marcellino, a.k.a. \"Jocko\" (1969\u2013present): original drummer, vocalist * Michael Brown, a.k.a. \"Downtown Michael Brown\" (2005\u2013present): saxophonist and vocalist, replaced Frankie Adell * Randy Hill, a.k.a. \"Rockin' Randy\" (2008\u2013present): lead guitarist * \"Screamin'\" Scott Simon (1970\u2013present): pianist, vocalist; replaced Joe Witkin * Tim Butler (2006, 2009, 2011\u2013present): bass guitarist * Ty Cox (2013\u2013present): drummer ;Former members: * Alan Cooper (1969\u20131970, 1971): original bass singer; brief return in 1971 due to Bowzer's illness * Billy Schwartz (1971): guitarist on Canadian tour in 1971 due to Chris Donald's inability to enter Canada * Bruce C.

Bass player Dave \"Chico\" Ryan died in 1998. While remaining in Sha Na Na, he joined Bill Haley & His Comets for the group's fall 1979 tour of Europe (Haley's last major tour before his death).
