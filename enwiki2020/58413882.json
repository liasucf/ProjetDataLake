    "text": "Pajub\u00e1 () is the name of the Brazilian cryptolect constituted of the insertion of numerous words and expressions coming from West African languages into the Portuguese language. It is spoken by practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions, such as Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda, and by the Brazilian LGBT community.Dicion\u00e1rio Bajub\u00e1-pajub\u00e1 Its source languages include Umbundu, Kimbundo, Kikongo, Egb\u00e1, Ewe, Fon and Yoruba. It is also often described as \"the speaking in the language of the saints\" or \"rolling the tongue\", much used by the \"saint people\" (priests of African religions) when one wants to say something so that other people cannot understand.Uma das l\u00ednguas de santo sendo analisadas, AS L\u00cdNGUAS VEICULARES NO CANDOMBL\u00c9 DE CONGO-ANGOLA Professor Doutor S\u00e9rgio Paulo Adolfo \u2013 Tata Kisaba Kiundundulu Universidade Estadual de LondrinaA Linguagem no Candombl\u00e9:um estudo lingu\u00edstico sobre as comunidades religiosas afro-brasileiras, por Antonio Gomes da Costa Neto ==Etymology== In both the candombl\u00e9 and the LGBT community, the word pajub\u00e1 or bajub\u00e1Bajub\u00e1 means \"gossip\", \"news\", or \"update\", referring to other related groups or events occurring (both good things and bad things) in those circles. ==History== Pajub\u00e1 began to be used by the LGBT community during the period of the military government of Brazil (1964\u201385) as a means of facing police repression and mislead what people could gather from what they heard. Originally created spontaneously in regions with the strongest African presence in Brazil, such as Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 \"terreiros\" (religious locations), the dialect resulting from the assimilation of current Africanisms, which was incomprehensible to those who had not previously learned their meanings, was adopted as a code between transvestite and later between all LGBT communities and sympathizers. In November 2018, a question mentioning Pajub\u00e1 was included in the National High School Exam. ==References== Category:Cant languages Category:LGBT culture in Brazil Category:Afro-Brazilian culture ",
