He held ministerial office in the governments of Alfred Deakin and Stanley Bruce, serving as Minister for Defence (1903\u20131904), Postmaster-General (1905\u20131907), Minister for Trade and Customs (1907\u20131908, 1923\u20131924), and Minister for Health (1923\u20131924). ==Early life== Chapman was born on 10 July 1864 in Bong Bong, New South Wales. He was the son of Monica (n\u00e9e Cain; also spelt Kean or Kein) and Richard Chapman, his father being a wheelwright and publican. His mother was born in Ireland. His given name was spelled \"Austen\" until 1897. Chapman attended the state school in Marulan until the age of 14, when he was apprenticed to a saddler working in Goulburn and Mudgee. By 1885 he was operating Chapman's Hotel in Bungendore, close to the eventual site of Canberra. Chapman moved to Sydney in 1887 and went into partnership with Edward William O'Sullivan in an auctioneering firm, of which he was managing partner. He was also the proprietor of the Emu Inn on Bathurst Street. His partnership with O'Sullivan was dissolved in 1889, and he subsequently established the Royal Hotel in Braidwood. ==New South Wales politics== In 1894 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as MLA for Braidwood. Like most politicians from the southern border regions of New South Wales, he was an active supporter of federation of the Australian colonies. ==Federal politics== Chapman c. 1907/08 In 1901 Chapman was elected to the first House of Representatives as MP for the Division of Eden-Monaro (his brother Albert succeeded him as the member for Braidwood in the New South Wales Parliament). A Protectionist, he was Minister for Defence in the first ministry of Alfred Deakin (1903\u201304), Postmaster-General in the second Deakin ministry (1905\u201308), and Minister for Trade and Customs from 1907 to 1908. After a long period on the backbench as a result of a stroke in 1909, which paralysed one of his arms, he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister for Health in the Bruce government in February 1923. He was criticised by both Nationalists and the Country Party and he resigned in May 1924 on the grounds of ill health and was subsequently made a . Chapman's most important contribution was his influence on the choice of the site of Australia's national capital, Canberra. He lobbied hard for the site on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan, in his electorate. The success of his lobbying benefited many of his friends who owned land in the area, and also greatly boosted trade in Queanbeyan, the nearest town to the site. He was still MP for Eden-Monaro at the time of his death in Sydney of cerebro-vascular disease. He was survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons, James Austin Chapman and John Austin Chapman who both became distinguished soldiers. The Canberra suburb of Chapman was named after him. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Australian politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Protectionist Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Cabinet of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Eden-Monaro Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Australian federationists Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:People from Bowral Category:People from Sydney Category:Australian auctioneers Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Defence ministers of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:People who died in office ",
