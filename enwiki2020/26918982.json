    "text": "Psalm 127 is the 127th psalm of the Book of Psalms, generally known in English by its first verse, in the King James Version, \"Except the Lord build the house\". The Book of Psalms is the third section of the Hebrew Bible, and a book of the Christian Old Testament. In the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, this psalm is known as Psalm 126 in a slightly different numbering system. In Latin, it is known by the incipit of its first 2 words, \"Nisi Dominus\".Parallel Latin/English Psalter / Psalmus 126 (127) medievalist.net It is one of 15 \"Songs of Ascents\" and the only one among them attributed to Solomon rather than David. The text is divided into five verses. The first two express the notion that \"without God, all is in vain\", popularly summarized in Latin in the motto Nisi Dominus Frustra. The remaining three verses describe progeny as God's blessing. The psalm is a regular part of Jewish, Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant liturgies. The Vulgate text Nisi Dominus was set to music numerous times during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, often as part of vespers, including Monteverdi's ten-part setting as part of his 1610 Vespro della Beata Vergine, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, (3 sets), H 150, H 160, H 231, George Frideric Handel's Nisi Dominus (1707) and two settings by Antonio Vivaldi. Composers such as Adam Gumpelzhaimer and Heinrich Sch\u00fctz set the German \"Wo Gott zum Haus\". == Authorship == According to Jewish tradition, this psalm was written by David and dedicated to his son Solomon, who would build the First Temple. According to Radak, verses 3\u20135, which reference \"sons\", express David's feelings about his son Solomon; according to Rashi, these verses refer to the students of a Torah scholar, who are called his \"sons\". The psalm's superscription calls it \"of Solomon\",See for example in the New International Version but Christian theologian Albert Barnes noted that \"in the Syriac Version, the title is, \"From the Psalms of the Ascent; spoken by David concerning Solomon; it was spoken also of Haggai and Zechariah, who urged the rebuilding of the Temple\". The Authorized Version describes the psalm as \"a Song of degrees for Solomon\", and Wycliffe's translators recognised both options.Noble, T. P. (2001), Psalm 127:1 Isaac Gottlieb of Bar Ilan University suggests that the reference in verse 2 to \"his beloved\" (yedido) \"recalls Solomon's other name, Yedidiah\".Gottlieb, I. B., \"Mashal Le-Melekh: the Search for Solomon\" in Hebrew Studies, Volume 51 (2010), pp. 107-127 ==Themes== Charles Spurgeon calls Psalm 127 \"The Builder's Psalm\", noting the similarity between the Hebrew words for sons (banim) and builders (bonim). He writes: > We are here taught that builders of houses and cities, systems and fortunes, > empires and churches all labour in vain without the Lord; but under the > divine favour they enjoy perfect rest. Sons, who are in the Hebrew called > \"builders\", are set forth as building up families under the same divine > blessing, to the great honour and happiness of their parents. Spurgeon also quotes the English preacher Henry Smith (1560\u20131591): \"Well doth David call children 'arrows' [v. 4]; for if they be well bred, they shoot at their parents' enemies; and if they be evil bred, they shoot at their parents\". The Midrash Tehillim interprets the opening verses of the psalm as referring to teachers and students of Torah. On the watchmen of the city mentioned in verse 1, Rabbi Hiyya, Rabbi Yosi, and Rabbi Ammi said, \"The [true] watchmen of the city are the teachers of Scripture and instructors of Oral Law\". On \"the Lord gives\" in verse 2, the Midrash explains that God \"gives\" life in the world to come to the wives of Torah scholars because they deprive themselves of sleep to support their husbands. (password: www.matsati.com) == Translation == Folio 56r, Psalm CXXVII The translation of the psalm offers difficulties, especially in verses 2 and 4. Jerome in a letter to Marcella (dated AD 384) laments that Origen's notes on this psalm were no longer extant, and discusses the various possible translations of (KJV \"bread of sorrows\", after the panem doloris of Vulgata Clementina; Jerome's own translation was panem idolorum \"bread of idols\" following LXX), and of (KJV \"children of the youth\", translated in LXX as \"children of the outcast\").Ph. Schaff, H. Wace, The Principal Works of St. Jerome (1892), Letter xxxiv. To Marcella \"The Hebrew phrase 'bread of sorrow' is rendered by the LXX. 'bread of idols'; by Aquila, 'bread of troubles'; by Symmachus, 'bread of misery.' Theodotion follows the LXX. So does Origen's Fifth Version. The Sixth renders 'bread of error.' In support of the LXX. the word used here is in Ps. cxv.4, translated 'idols.' Either the troubles of life are meant or else the tenets of heresy.\" There are two possible interpretations of the phrase (KJV: \"for so he giveth his beloved sleep\"): The word \"sleep\" may either be the direct object (as in KJV, following LXX and Vulgate), or an accusative used adverbially, \"in sleep\", i.e. \"while they are asleep\". The latter interpretation fits the context of the verse much better, contrasting the \"beloved of the Lord\" who receive success without effort, as it were \"while they sleep\" with the sorrowful and fruitless toil of those not so blessed, a sentiment paralleled by Proverbs 10:22 (KJV \"The blessing of the , it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.\"). Keil and Delitzsch (1883) accept the reading of the accusative as adverbial, paraphrasing \"\"God gives to His beloved in sleep, i.e., without restless self-activity, in a state of self-forgetful renunciation, and modest, calm surrender to Him\".\"God gives to His beloved (Psalm 60:7; Deuteronomy 33:12) \u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d0 (equals \u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d4), in sleep (an adverbial accusative like \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05bc\u05e7\u05e8, \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1), i.e., without restless self- activity, in a state of self-forgetful renunciation, and modest, calm surrender to Him: 'God bestows His gifts during the night,' says a German proverb, and a Greek proverb even says: \u03b5\u1f55\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f31\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6 [the fish-trap catches while they sleep]. B\u00fccher takes \u05db\u05bc\u05df in the sense of 'so equals without anything further;' and \u05db\u05df certainly has this meaning sometimes (vid., introduction to Psalm 110:1-7), but not in this passage, where, as referring back, it stands at the head of the clause, and where what this mimic \u05db\u05df would import lies in the word \u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d0.\" Carl Friedrich Keil, Franz Delitzsch Commentary on the Old Testament (Biblischer Kommentar \u00fcber das Alte Testament vol. 8, 1883), English edition by T. and T. Clark, Edinburgh (1892-94). However, A. F. Kirkpatrick in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges (1906) argues that while the reading \"So he giveth unto his beloved in sleep\" fits the context, the natural translation of the Hebrew text is still the one given by the ancient translators, suggesting that the Hebrew text as transmitted has been corrupted (which would make the LXX and Vulgate readings not so much \"mistranslations\" as correct translations of an already corrupted reading).\"Most commentators however adopt the rendering, So he giveth unto his beloved in sleep. This rendering is certainly not the natural rendering of the Heb. text. Wellhausen condemns it as \u201cquite inadmissible\u201d. It requires the supplement of an object to the verb, and \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 must be taken as accus. of manner. If it were not for the exegetical difficulty, no one would hesitate to take \u2018sleep,\u2019 as the Ancient Versions take it, as the object of the verb \u2018giveth.\u2019 Some word however seems to be needed to correspond to the results of anxious toil, and though the Ancient Versions already had the present reading, the text may be corrupt. The anomalous form of the word for sleep (\u05e9\u05e0\u05d0 for \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4) may point in this direction.\" English translations have been reluctant to emend the translation, due to the long-standing association of this verse with sleep being the gift of God.Charles Ellicott, Commentary for English Readers (1897). Modern translations which do emend the passage include: Brenton (1844), New American Standard Bible (1968), Complete Jewish Bible (1998), New English Translation (2005); Luther (1545) already has \"denn seinen Freunden gibt er's schlafend.\" (\"as to his friends he grants while [they are] asleep.\" Abraham Cronbach (1933) refers to this as \"one of those glorious mistranslations, a mistranslation which enabled Mrs. Browning to write one of the tenderest poems in the English language\",Abraham Cronbach, Religion and Its Social Setting: Together with Other Essays (1933), p. 193. referring to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem The Sleep, which uses \"He giveth his beloved Sleep\" as the last line of each stanza. Keil and Delitzsch (1883) take \"to sit up\" as confirmation for the assumption, also suggested by 1 Samuel 20:24, that the custom of the Hebrews before the Hellenistic period was to take their meals sitting up, and not reclining as was the Greco-Roman custom.

It is also recited as a prayer for protection of a newborn infant. ===Catholic Church=== Since the early Middle ages, this psalm was traditionally recited or sung at the Office of none during the week, specifically from Tuesday until Saturday between Psalm 126 and Psalm 128, following the Rule of St. Benedict.Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger, R\u00e8gle de saint Beno\u00eet, (Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes, r\u00e9impression 2007) p46. During the Liturgy of the Hours, Psalm 126 is recited on the third Wednesday at vespers.The main cycle of liturgical prayers takes place over four weeks. === Protestantism === The pro-natalist Quiverfull movement invokes the less quoted latter part of the psalm, verses 3\u20135 concerning the blessings and advantages of numerous offspring, as one of the foundations for their stance and takes its name from the last verse (\"Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them [i.e. sons]\"). == Musical settings == The Vulgate text of the psalm, Nisi Dominus, has been set to music many times, often as part of vespers services. Settings from the classical period use the text of the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate of 1592, which groups Cum dederit dilectis suis somnum (\"as he gives sleep to those in whom he delights\") with verse 3 rather than verse 2 (as opposed to Jerome's text, and most modern translations, grouping the phrase with verse 2). Notable compositions include:see Psalm 127 at Choral Public Domain Library for a detailed list. * Orlando di Lasso, a capella motet for five voices, published in 1562.Sacrae cantiones quinque vocum, Nuremberg, 1562), no. 15. Lasso's version predates the Vulgata Clementina, but his text already follows its reading Cum dederit dilectis suis somnum, ecce h\u00e6reditas Domini filii, merces fructus ventris. which is derived from revised editions of the Vulgate published in the first half of the 16th century, notably those by Stephanus. * Hans Leo Hassler, a capella motet, published in Cantiones sacrae, 1591 * Giovanni Matteo Asola, a capella setting published in 1599 * Monteverdi's Nisi Dominus for a ten-part choir, part of Vespro della Beata Vergine (1610) * Alessandro Grandi, motet with trombones and basso continuo, published 1630 * Francesco Cavalli, setting for four parts and strings, published in Musiche Sacre Concernenti, Venice, 1656. * Giovanni Giacomo Arrigoni, motet, published in 1663 * Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Nisi Dominus for soloists, chorus, 2 treble instruments and bc H 150 (? early 1670) ; for soloists, chorus and bc H.160 - 160 a (? early 1670) ; for three voices, 2 treble instruments and bc H 231 (?) *Henry Desmarest, grand motet Nisi dominus (17..) *Michel-Richard Delalande, grand motet Nisi Dominus S.42 (1729) * Biber, cantata for 2 voices, violin and b.c.

Adam Gumpelzhaimer used the first two lines for a canon, Wo Gott zum Haus nicht gibt sein Gunst / So arbeit jedermann umsonst (\"Where God to the house does not give his blessing / There toils every man in vain\"). Another German version is Wo der Herr nicht das Haus bauet by Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (SWV 400, published 1650). == Nisi Dominus Frustra == Coat of arms of the City of Edinburgh NISI DEVS / FRVSTRA / 1648+, inscription on a house in Castle Donington, Leicestershire Nisi Dominus Frustra (Without God, [it is] in vain) is a popular motto derived from verse 1. As an abbreviation of \"Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it\". It is often inscribed on buildings. It has been the motto in the coat of arms of the City of Edinburgh since 1647 and was the motto of the former Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea. It was similarly the motto of the King's Own Scottish Borderers. It has been adopted as the motto for numerous schools in Great Britain, including King Edward VI High School, Stafford, Melbourn Village College, London, and as the insignia of Glenlola Collegiate School in Northern Ireland. Other schools with this motto are St Joseph's College, Dumfries, Villa Maria Academy (Malvern, Pennsylvania), Rickmansworth School (Nisi Dominus Aedificaverit), The Park School, Yeovil, Bukit Bintang Girls' School, St Thomas School, Kolkata, Kirkbie Kendal School, Richmond College, Galle and Mount Temple Comprehensive School, Dublin, Ireland. The Aquitanian city of Agen takes as its motto the second verse of the psalm, \"Nisi dominus custodierit civitatem frustra vigilat qui custodit eam\": \"Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain\" (verse 1a, NIV version). Edinburgh Napier University, established in 1964, has \"secularized\" the city's motto to \"Nisi sapientia frustra\" (i.e. \"without knowledge/wisdom, all is in vain\"). ==References== ==Sources== * == External links == * * * Text of Psalm 127 according to the 1928 Psalter * Psalms Chapter 127 text in Hebrew and English, mechon-mamre.org * Unless the LORD build the house, they labor in vain who build. text and footnotes, usccb.org Unites States Conference of Catholic Bishops * Psalm 127:1 introduction and text, biblestudytools.com * Psalm 127 \u2013 God\u2019s Work in Building Houses, Cities, and Families enduringword.com * Psalm 127 / Refrain: The Lord shall keep watch over your going out and your coming in.
