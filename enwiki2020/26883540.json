    "text": "Djavan (also known by its subtitle, A Voz, O Viol\u00e3o, A M\u00fasica de Djavan ) is the first album by Brazilian singer and songwriter Djavan. It was released in 1976. The album features some of the singer's early hits, like \"Flor de Lis,\" \"Para-Raio\", \"E Que Deus Ajude\" and \"Fato Consumado\". ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Alvaro Neder awarded the album 4 and a half stars stating \"The highlights are the wonderful melodies, the musical sonority of his lyrics (it even doesn't matter if you understand them, as his focus is on its musicality), the smart viol\u00e3o of Djavan, and the rich rhythmic interplay between voice and viol\u00e3o. All of the compositions are great, exploring from samba to bai\u00e3o, and, more importantly, it's mostly an acoustic band album, with cool touches of a Rhodes.\".Neder, A.
