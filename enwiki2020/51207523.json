The Pandya dynasty had provinces on either sides of the Western Ghats. The King of Pandalam helped Marthanda Varma to conquer the Kayamkulam province. In return for this help, Marthanda Varma did not attempt to attack and conquer Pandalam or Adoor, during the expansion of his kingdom. The princely state of Pandalam had extended up to Thodupuzha in Idukki district once. Pandalam and Adoor was annexed to Travancore in 1820. Before the formation of Pathanamthitta district,Adoor and Pandalam was in Mavelikara taluk of Alappuzha district. King Marthandavarma once came to Adoor to hide from ettuvettil pillai's (a wealthy family who tried to capture King Marthandavarma and to get hold of his throne) and sought the help of nellimuttil family . Mannadi is also another historical place near Adoor where Velu Thampi Dalava died evading the Britishers. Both Pandalam and Adoor were part of Central Travancore and was never directly under British Rule. Adoor was a major town of wealthy Hindu families and nottable Syro-Malabar Christian families. Adoor was never captured by King Marthanadavarma. It is known that in the rule of the Ay Kings a Buddhist Monastery was there in Adoor. ===Modern Period=== In the nineteenth century Adoor was a census town. In the twentieth century Adoor was a fully developed town, with modern facilities like schools, libraries, hospitals etc. Adoor was made a municipality in 1988 and Pandalam after 2000. ==History of Ranni== The history of Ranni can be traced 5000 years back to the early settlement activity of Adi Dravidans around Sabarimala and Nilackal. The temple at Sabarimala is an early temple of Kerala, dating back to around 2000 years. The deity's sitting posture and resemblance of the prayer 'Sharanam vili' to \"Buddham Sharanam / Sangam Sharanam\" points to the Buddhist past. Buddhist hermits always prefer to stay in interior jungles for solitary contemplation to attain Nirvana. The word 'Ayya' is a Buddhist Pali word means Lord/God. There was an ancient trade route passed through Nilackal between Kerala and Pandian kingdom. ==History of Thiruvalla== This article is primarily about the history of the settlements in areas of present city around the temple, known historically as Tiruvalla. For the history of the places in Tiruvalla, also refer : History of Niranam, History of Koipuram, History of Kumbanad, History of Kavumbhagom. ===Middle ages=== The Kaavil market, which is no longer in existence, was once one of the most famous markets of Kerala, involved in foreign trade. Even now, the houses in this street are known as \"Kaavil\" among residents, and the houses in the area which is now Pushpagiri- Thukalassery are known as \"Malayil\" because they are in an elevated area compared to Kaavil. The Kaavil market was actually situated in the street starting from Erankavu Temple to the Kaavil temple in the present Kavumbhagom. It was also the first settlement area of the early Christians in Tiruvalla. The renowned Poem \"Unnuneeli Sandesham\" discusses this then famous street and its people. This was the heartland of Tiruvalla up to the 19th century. (East to MC road was forest area. Dens were found in the KSRTC garage area, which are now buried.) The first school in Tiruvalla started sometime in mid 19th century in Kaavil market, along the road to Pallippalam. Still, major religious processions are required to pass through this way, even though new roads have been constructed in parallel. Tiruvalla Christians were part of the autonomous Indian Syrian Church, which was not affected by the schism which occurred in the 17th century due to the intervention of Portuguese colonists. By 19th century, inspired by the work of the British missionaries, a reformation movement happened which eventually resulted in a schism, leading to the formation of Marthoma Church. === Modern period === Tiruvalla was never under direct British rule, and before India's independence from Britain, it was governed by the Travancore dynasty. The Tiruvalla municipality started functioning in 1919, with Shri M.K. Kesavan Nair as the first Chairman of the Municipal Council. The constitution was officially approved on 8 October 1920. The municipal office has established several public health facilities, libraries and sports facilities. ==References== ",
