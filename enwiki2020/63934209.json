He had a junior career with the Sturt Sabres before he joined the Centre of Excellence Program at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). Mudronja has also represented Australia nationally and won a gold medal at the FIBA Oceania competition. He was a member of the South Australian state basketball team when they won the U20 Men's Championships in 2017 and was awarded the Bob Staunton Award as the most outstanding player during the 2018 competition. Mudronja trained with his hometown 36ers at the end of his AIS stint but was instead encouraged to play collegiately for the Saint Mary's Gaels. After one season with the Gaels, Mudronja returned to Australia in 2019 and signed a three-year contract with the 36ers. 36ers head coach Joey Wright called Mudronja \"the best point guard of his class in Australia\". He was assigned as a development player during the 2019\u201320 season before he was elevated to a full roster position for the remainder of his contract. ==References== ==External links== *NBL profile *College statistics Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Adelaide 36ers players Category:Australian Institute of Sport basketball players Category:Australian men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from South Australia Category:Guards (basketball) Category:People educated at Lake Ginninderra College Category:Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Adelaide Category:Universiade medalists in basketball Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Australia Category:Medalists at the 2019 Summer Universiade ",
