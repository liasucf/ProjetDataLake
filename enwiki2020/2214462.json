It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post voting system. Kilmarnock county constituency was created when the district of burghs constituency was abolished. ==Boundaries== The constituency consisted of five parliamentary burghs: Kilmarnock in the county of Ayr, Dumbarton in the county of Dumbarton, Rutherglen in the county of Lanark and Renfrew and Port Glasgow in the county of Renfrew. The Kilmarnock burgh was previously within the Ayrshire constituency and Port Glasgow was previously within the Renfrewshire constituency. Dumbarton, Rutherglen and Renfrew were transferred from Glasgow Burghs. In 1918 the burgh of Kilmarnock was merged into the then new Kilmarnock county constituency, which included areas previously within North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. The new Kilmarnock constituency consisted of \"The county district of Kilmarnock, inclusive of all burghs situated therein except in so far as included in the Ayr District of Burghs.\" The burgh of Dumbarton was transferred to Dumbarton Burghs, the burgh of Port Glasgow was merged into West Renfrewshire, the burgh of Renfrew into East Renfrewshire and the burgh of Rutherglen into the Rutherglen constituency. ==Members of Parliament== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1832 | John Dunlop | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1835 | John Bowring | Radical |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1837 | John Campbell Colquhoun | Conservative |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1841 | Alexander Johnston | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | May 1844 by-election | rowspan=\"2\" | Edward Pleydell-Bouverie | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1859 | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Feb 1874 | James Fortescue Harrison | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1880 | John Dick Peddie | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1885 | Peter Sturrock | Conservative |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1886 | Stephen Williamson | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1895 | John McAusland Denny | Conservative |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1906 | Adam Rolland Rainy | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1911 by-election | Will Gladstone | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1915 by-election | Alexander Shaw | Liberal |- |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 1918 |colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished: see Kilmarnock |} ==Election results== ===Elections in the 1830s=== ===Elections in the 1840s=== Johnston's death caused a by-election. ===Elections in the 1850s=== Pleydell-Bouverie was appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade, requiring a by-election.
