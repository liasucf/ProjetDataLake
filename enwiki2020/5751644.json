The 'M' of Moreno Valley on the mountain, lit in 2009. The \"Big C\" on the mountain. Box Springs Mountain is said to have gotten its name during the 1880s. Teamsters with horse-drawn wagons would stop at a natural spring in an arroyo of the range to water their horses. A teamster surrounded it with a box to maintain water access, later giving the spring and range their names.Holtzclaw, Kenneth M. Images of America: Moreno Valley, Arcadia Publishing, 2007. . The letter \"C\" is embedded on the Riverside-facing side. The \"Big C\" was built in 1957, mostly by UC Riverside students. E.L. Yeager donated the materials for it. The \"C\" is approximately 1,500 feet above the UCR campus, and was the world's largest poured-concrete block letter, 132 feet high by 70 feet wide. The \"C\" is often vandalized with graffiti.

There are several large eucalyptus trees that were planted at its base that originally marked sources of water. The mountain is susceptible to wildfires which char the hillsides and pose a danger to residences at the base of the mountain. However, they are a natural part of fire ecology in the chaparral and woodland natural habitats. ==See also== * Box Springs Mountains * University of California Natural Reserve System == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == * * Google Maps Satellite view of Box Springs Mountain showing the large painted concrete letter \"C\" * Google Maps Satellite view of Box Springs Mountain showing the large painted letter \"M\" Category:Mountains of Riverside County, California Category:Geography of Riverside, California Category:Mountains of Southern California ",
