Places it is found include Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Eswatini, West Africa, Fiji and Samoa. It is known to be a pasture grass and is a livestock grazing feed grass specialty, but in some cases it is a common rice weed. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia\u2019 records that it is \"an excellent pasture grass, much relished by stock ; it has tender panicles, and grows from two to three feet high. It is not endemic in Australia but is found in New South Wales and Queensland\" == Gallery == File:\u5343\u91d1\u5b50 Leptochloa chinensis 20190509105938 01.jpg File:\u5343\u91d1\u5b50 Leptochloa chinensis 20190509105938 02.jpg ==References== Category:Chloridoideae Category:Grasses of Africa Category:Grasses of Asia Category:Flora of tropical Asia Category:Flora of Fiji Category:Flora of Japan Category:Flora of Samoa Category:Flora of South Korea Category:Flora of Swaziland Category:Poales of Australia ",
