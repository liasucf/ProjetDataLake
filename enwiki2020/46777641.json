    "text": "Laff Trakk is an indoor-spinning steel roller coaster at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The roller coaster was designed by Maurer AG while the indoor theming was designed by Raven Sun Creative. Laff Trakk is Hersheypark's 13th current roller coaster and is located in the Midway America section of the park, adjacent to the Whip and Merry-Derry-Dip attractions. The site of the coaster is on the former location of Granny Bugs, Miniature Train, and Pony Parade, three kinds of kiddie rides. The coaster is considered a \"glow coaster\" because of the interior theming of the ride which appears to glow in the dark. The ride track is black-blue as is its support, with the ride vehicles being violet. The theming also recalls past funhouses that were in Hersheypark between 1930 and 1972. Laff Trakk opened to the general public on May 23, 2015. ==History== On July 15, 2014, the first hint of Hersheypark's 2015 attraction was released. Each clue would consist of a riddle, relating to the theme of the attraction. The clues were released every Tuesday for four weeks until Laff Trakk was officially announced on August 12, 2014. with the official name announced, an animated on-ride POV, photo-ops referencing the ride theme, and meet-and-greet characters seen in the clues including a fortune teller and Laffing Sal. The ride reaches an approximate height of 50 ft (15 m) and consists of 1,400 ft (427 m) of track. The ride vehicle consists of four seats, back-to-back, that will begin to freely-spin 360\u00b0 during the ride. The spinning of the ride vehicle depends on weight distribution throughout the car. The ride vehicle features decals including the Hersheypark Logo, the Laff Trakk logo, and multiple playing cards featuring Laffing Sal. ==Ride experience== After boarding, you take an immediate right out of the station and travel up the lift hill to approximately 50 ft (15 m). Turning left off the lift, you proceed through a short brake run, with a giant 2-D stack of cards to your right. The car then takes a dip to the right through three pairs of giant green picture/mirror frames. After going up another hill, you glide past a 2-D large snake on the wall before turning left into a small brake run with walls on the left and right of the cars. Upon exiting this brake run, your ride vehicle is able to freely spin 360\u00b0. Taking a dive to the right, you then experience an 85\u00b0 high-banked turn. Then, you turn around and go through multiple short s-bend track parts until you turn right into yet another break run with 2-D \"fire\" rings going around the track. Following the brake run, you go through a helix around a fortune teller's table featuring a \"crystal ball\". Going through more s-bend turns, you curve around and enter the final brake run featuring small fun house mirrors on each side of the car. At this point your ride vehicle spins to its neutral position and the ability to spin locks. ==See also== * 2015 in amusement parks ==References== Category:Hersheypark Category:Roller coasters in Pennsylvania Category:2015 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
