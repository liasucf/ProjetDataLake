    "text": "Governance without government is a form of governance which uses non- governmental means (NGM) of government. It is a paradigm opposing modern democracy. Modern democracy uses democratic procedures and institutions, including legislation and communicative rationality, whereas governance without government uses laws of nature instead of legislation, and one-way communication instead of dialogue. Governance without government is linked to managed democracy, a distorted version of democracy, and inverted totalitarianism, dismantling public institutions and giving the power to institutions where democratic claims are no valid, e.g. big corporations and secret societies. == Studies in governance without government == === Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri === Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri describe governance without government as the method of governing an empire, by which they mean the current world-system based on Friedmanite economics and military power. Thus governance without government uses governmental agencies to promote itself.Hardt, Michael & Negri, Antonio: Emipre. === Georg Simmel === Georg Simmel uses German concept \"Form des Beharrens\" meaning the idea of governance without government, in connection to monetarist idea of economic exchange in fixed-monetary-base regime.Simmel, Georg: Philosophie des Geldes (The Philosophy of Money) === Pierre Bourdieu === Pierre Bourdieu sees independent i.e. Friedmanite central banks as the key powerholders, connecting them to Chicago economics, and Chicago economics to one-way communication, economists being not willing to discuss and keen to explain.Bourdieu, Pierre: Contre-Feux (Counterfire: Against the Tyranny of the Market) === Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann === Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann describe year 1989 as the end of the modern era and beginning of the non-democratic regimes around the world attacking against the welfare of the majority of people.Martin, Hans-Peter & Schumann, Harald: Die Globalisierungsfalle: Der Angriff auf Demokratie und Wohlstand (The Global Trap) === Naomi Klein === Naomi Klein describes year 1989 as the beginning of Washington consensus and the policy of denying all discussion about alternative economic policies.Klein, Naomi: Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism === Larry Cat\u00e1 Backer === Larry Cat\u00e1 Backer describes the organization of economics within multinational enterprise and in global production chains as the basis for governance that in some respects displaces the traditional organization of politics in government within states.
