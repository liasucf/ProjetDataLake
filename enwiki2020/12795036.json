    "text": "Salsat toum or toumya (Levantine Arabic 'garlic') is a garlic sauce common to the Levant. The word toum is how the Arabic word for garlic (\u062b\u0648\u0645) \"thoum\" is pronounced in the dialect of the people from the Levant region. Similar to the Proven\u00e7al aioli, there are many variations with a common one containing garlic, salt, olive oil or vegetable oil, and lemon juice, traditionally crushed together using a wooden mortar and pestle. There is also a variation popular in many places, such as the town of Zgharta, in Lebanon, where mint is added; it is called zeit wa toum (lit. \u2018olive and garlic\u2019). Salsat toum (garlic sauce) is used as a dip, especially with French fries, chicken and artichoke, and in Levantine sandwiches, especially those containing chicken. It is also commonly served with grilled chicken dishes. ==See also== * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Arab cuisine Category:Lebanese cuisine Category:Levantine cuisine Category:Egyptian cuisine Category:Iraqi cuisine Category:Syrian cuisine Category:Garlic dishes Category:Condiments Category:Jordanian cuisine ",
