Starring Rajendra Prasad, Suhasini, Kaveri Jha in the lead roles and music composed by E. S. Murthy. The film is remake of Kannada film Eradane Maduve (2011). ==Plot== Venkat (Rajendra Prasad) is an Income Tax officer, who falls victim of being too sincere to his duty. He ends up caught in an embarrassing situation with a lady, caught live on TV by overly enthusiastic media, as a result of which he is suspended from duty. What causes him trouble is not that he lost his job, but that he has lost the trust and respect of his wife Madhavi (Suhasini), and his three daughters. Unable to bear their tantrums, especially of his wife, he schemes a weird plot to re-establish his importance in the family. He brings in Veena (Kaveri Jha) as his girlfriend to make his family members insecure of losing him. What Venkat doesn't know is that his wife will do the same to get back attention from her husband. However, the guy whom she chooses as her acting boyfriend happens to be her elder daughter's real-life boyfriend. It is through this confusing relationship the movie tries to tell the importance of love, respect, family and importantly trust through troubling times. ==Cast== * Rajendra Prasad as Venkat * Suhasini as Madhavi * Kaveri Jha as Veena * Naresh * Raghu Babu * Harsha Vardhan * Jhansi * Rajitha * Shilpa ==References== ==External links== Category:Indian films Category:Indian comedy-drama films Category:Telugu remakes of Kannada films Category:2010s Telugu-language films Category:2011 comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Dinesh Baboo ",
