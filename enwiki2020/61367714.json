    "text": "\"Midnight to Six Man\" is a song by British garage rock band the Pretty Things. It was first published in 1966 and registered at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart and 19 in the Netherlands. The arrangement is one of the fullest on early Pretty Things cuts, due to the piano of Nicky Hopkins (who played similar R&B; piano on the Who's My Generation album) and the organist from the all-female band Goldie and the Gingerbreads. == Personnel == *Phil May \u2013 vocals *Dick Taylor \u2013 lead guitar *Brian Pendleton \u2013 guitar *John Stax \u2013 bass guitar *Skip Alan \u2013 drums == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
