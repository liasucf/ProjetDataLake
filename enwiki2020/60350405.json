The 1910 Rogers Pass avalanche was the deadliest avalanche in Canadian history, resulting in the deaths of 62 Canadian Pacific Railway workers. http://www.revelstokemuseum.ca/blog/2016/3/4/overwhelmed-remembering-the- march-4-1910-avalanche-at-rogers-pass In the late afternoon of March 4, 1910, an avalanche swept down the slopes of Cheops, burying the railroad tracks in snow. The men were working to clear the tracks when shortly before midnight the deadly slide hit, coming from the opposite side of the valley down Avalanche Mountain. The mountain's current name was officially adopted in 1951 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Prior to that it was known as Mount Cheops. The peak was named by Otto Julius Klotz for its resemblance to the Pyramid of Cheops.Cheops Mountain BC Geographical Names ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Cheops Mountain has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
