    "text": "Benjamin Ferrey, FSA, FRIBA (1810 \u2013 1880) was an English architect who worked mostly in the Gothic Revival. ==Family== Benjamin Ferrey was the youngest son of Benjamin Ferrey Snr, a draper who became Mayor of Christchurch.Pevsner & Lloyd, 1967, page 169 He was educated at Wimborne Grammar School. In 1836 Benjamin married Ann Lucas. They had two daughters, Alicia and Annie, and one son, Edmund Benjamin (b. 1845 or 1846), who also became an architect, studying under his father and then assisting in his work. Ferrey married a second time in 1872. ==Career== After grammar school, Ferrey went to London to study under Augustus Charles Pugin and alongside Pugin's son Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. In his early twenties Ferrey toured continental Europe, then studied further in the office of William Wilkins. He started his own architectural practice in 1834, in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London. Some of the earliest work of his practice was in the design of the new seaside resort of Bournemouth. The business grew rapidly and was very successful, with Ferrey designing and restoring or rebuilding many Church of England parish churches. Ferrey also designed private houses and public buildings, including a number of Tudor Revival ones in the earlier part of his career.Newman & Pevsner, 1972, page 55 Charles Eastlake in his History of the Gothic Revival described Ferrey as \"one of the earliest, ablest, and most zealous pioneers of the modern Gothic school\" and said his work \"possessed the rare charm of simplicity, without lacking interest\".Eastlake, 1872, page 220 Ferrey was twice Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects and in 1870 was awarded a Royal Gold Medal. He was Diocesan Architect to the Diocese of Bath and Wells from 1841 until his death, carrying out much of the restoration work on Wells Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace. He was also appointed Honorary Secretary to the Architects' Committee for the Houses of Parliament. ==Work== ===Buildings=== *Tarrant Hinton, Dorset: Old Rectory, 1836Newman & Pevsner, 1972, page 418
