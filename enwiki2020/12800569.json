    "text": "Countryman is a 1982 action/adventure film directed by Dickie Jobson. It tells the story of a Jamaican fisherman whose solitude is shattered when he rescues two Americans from the wreckage of a plane crash. The fisherman, called Countryman, is hurled into a political plot by the dangerous Colonel Sinclair. Countryman uses his knowledge of the terrain and his innate combat skills to survive and protect his new friends from being caught by Sinclair. This film explores Jamaican culture; at the end of the film, it is described as a tribute to the musical legend Bob Marley whose music is often played throughout the film. The film was the first from Island Records' new film division. The film was shot in Jamaica and featured a reggae soundtrack performed by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Bob Marley & the Wailers, Steel Pulse, Dennis Brown, Aswad, Toots & The Maytals and Rico Rodriguez. It was written by Jobson and produced by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and has become a cult classic.Johnson, Richard (2016) \"Actor Countryman is dead\", Jamaica Observer, 20 September 2016.
