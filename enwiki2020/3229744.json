    "text": "Berlin Frankfurter Allee is a railway station situated on Frankfurter Allee in the Friedrichshain district of Berlin, close to the district's border with Lichtenberg. It is served by the S-Bahn lines , (the ringbahn), , and the U-Bahn line . ==History== The station was first opened on 1 May 1872 as Friedrichsberg. In 1890-91 the current station Frankfurter Alle was opened, in addition to the platform between the tracks, the station had a brick entrance. When the U5 was built at the end of the 1920s, the old Ringbahn bridge was torn down and replaced with a wider bridge. There was intended to be a direct connection between the underground U5 station and the above ground S-bahn station;- however, this was never developed. It is not practical to build such a connection now as the S-bahn platform would need to be on the bridge over the road. As the rails are not wide apart enough to fit a platform between them, the bridge would need to be entirely rebuilt. ==References== Category:Berlin S-Bahn stations Category:Berlin U-Bahn stations Category:Buildings and structures in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1872 ",
