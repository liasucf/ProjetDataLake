    "text": "Katherine River Bridge Katherine Low Level View in June 1962 Katherine River at the town of Katherine during the dry season. Katherine River is located in the Northern Territory, Australia. Its headwaters are in Nitmiluk National Park, it flows through the town of Katherine, and is a major tributary of the Daly River. The Katherine River drops around 384m over its 328 km length. The first European to see and name the river was the Scottish explorer John McDouall Stuart on 4 July 1862, and named it Katherine after Catherine Chambers, the second daughter of expedition sponsor James Chambers. The major town Katherine was named after the river. In late January, 1998, heavy rain associated with Cyclone Les raised the level of the river by more than 20 metres and flooded a large part of Katherine town. A more recent flood on 6 April 2006 caused a state of emergency to be declared. During this event the river peaked at a height of just below 19 metres at the Katherine bridge on the Stuart Highway. ==See also== *List of rivers of Northern Territory ==References== Category:Rivers of the Northern Territory ",
