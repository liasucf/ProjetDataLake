The series took place from 6 to 10 April 2019, with all matches played at the Lugogo Cricket Oval in Kampala. The participating teams were the women's national sides of Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe. These were the first matches played by Kenya Women to have WT20I status after the International Cricket Council announced that all matches played between women's teams of Associate Members after 1 July 2018 would have full T20I status. The tournament provided all three teams with some preparation for the 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Africa. Zimbabwe defeated Uganda in the final by 25 runs. ==Points Table== ==Matches== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Final== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:Women's cricket in Uganda Category:International cricket competitions in 2018\u201319 Category:2019 in Ugandan cricket ",
