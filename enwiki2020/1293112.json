Despite hit singles and fan favorites such as \"Lock and Load,\" \"Manhattan,\" and \"Hands in the Air,\" the album charted at No. 27 on The Billboard charts. This was Seger's lowest chart position since 1976's Live Bullet which charted at No. 34 on the Billboard 200. It's a Mystery was Seger's last album before taking a hiatus from the music industry to be with his family. He would return in 2006 with the album Face the Promise. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Bob Seger \u2013 synthesizer, acoustic guitar, guitar, piano, bass, vocals, drum machine *Kenny Aronoff \u2013 drums *Eddie Bayers \u2013 drums *Roy Bittan \u2013 piano *George Bohanon \u2013 trombone *Rosemary Butler \u2013 background vocals *Chris Campbell \u2013 bass *Sam Clayton \u2013 maracas *Scott Crago \u2013 drums *Laura Creamer \u2013 background vocals *Craig Frost \u2013 synthesizer, keyboard, electric piano, drum machine *Donny Gerrard \u2013 background vocals *Bob Glaub \u2013 bass *Richie Hayward \u2013 drums *Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums *Gary Mallaber \u2013 drums, brushes *Tim Mitchell \u2013 guitar, rhythm guitar *Shaun Murphy \u2013 background vocals *Buell Neidlinger \u2013 bass *Bill Payne \u2013 synthesizer *Alto Reed \u2013 baritone saxophone *Rudy Richman \u2013 percussion *Tom Roady \u2013 maracas *Harry Stinson \u2013 drums *Fred Tackett \u2013 guitar *Michael Thompson \u2013 guitar *Jeffrey C.J.
