It is an ecoregion of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands Biome.The Rupununi Savannahs: An Eco-Tourist's Dream ==Description== The Rupununi Savannah is located between the Rupununi River and the border with Brazil and Venezuela. The Rupununi forms the southwestern wilderness territory of Guyana, a South American country situated on the Northeastern littoral of South America. The savannah is dissected by the Kanuku Mountains. The Rupununi Savannah encompasses 5000 square miles of virtually untouched grasslands, swamplands, rain-forested mountains. The region usually floods in the wet season (May to August). Early European explorers believed that the Rupununi floodplains were the legendary Lake Parime.Charles Waterton, Wanderings in South America, Cassell & Co, Ltd: London, Paris & Melbourne. 1891.Humboldt, Alexander von, Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799-1804, (chapter 25). Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853.Graham Watkins, Pete Oxford, and Rene\u00e9 Bish. Rupununi: Rediscovering a Lost World, Earth in Focus Editions; November 1, 2010 . The area is inhabited by some 15,000 Amerindians. ==Biodiversity== The savannah is divided north from south, by the Kanuku Mountains, Guyana\u2019s most biologically diverse region. According to Conservation International, the \"area supports a large percentage of Guyana\u2019s biodiversity\", including 250 species of bird life, 18 of which are native \"only to the lowland forests of the Guianas.\" The savannah is teeming with wildlife, including a large variety of bird species. The savannah is also home to the jaguar as well as the Harpy Eagle, the world\u2019s most powerful bird of prey, an extremely rare and endangered species which once ranged the forests of South America and is found in the Rupununi/Kanuku mountain range. ==Population== The Rupununi is the home of the Wapishana, Macushi, Wai-Wai and Patamona peoples.Rupununi people A recent survey recorded a population of 14,689 Amerindians. The Wapishana live mainly in the south savannah, the Macushi in the north. Some 200 Wai-Wai live in near isolation in the remote southeastern region bordering Brazil virtually untouched by modern life. The major occupations or industries in the Rupununi Savannah are cattle ranching for beef, Balat\u00e1 bleeding to extract latex; farming groundnuts, maize (corn), cassava, and vegetables; fishing and hunting; and craft work such as the manufacture of hammocks, leather articles, Nibbi furniture and beadwork). There are Amerindian villages dotted throughout the Rupununi Savannah, as well as many ranches worked by vaqueros (cowboys), some of whom are descendants of 19th century Scottish settlers. The main town is Lethem, located beside the Takutu River, on the border with Brazil. Owing to the savanna's remoteness from the rest of the country most trade is conducted with Brazil and most people speak Portuguese. In 1969 some ranchers started what has been referred to as the Rupununi Uprising. The revolt was quelled within a few days.Odeen Ishmael.

It is designated a \"protected area\" by the government of Guyana, housing some 80% of the mammals and 60% of the bird life found in Guyana\u2019s tropical forests and savannahs. Several Lodges welcome guests, for example Dadanawa Ranch or Karanambu ranch.Guyana\u2019s Rupununi Land of Nature, Authentic Culture, and Adventure The Rupununi is accessible by small aircraft and helicopter flights regularly available from Guyana\u2019s capital Georgetown on the Atlantic coast. In the dry season it is accessible by an unpaved \"all-weather\" road using trucks or 4x4 vehicles. It takes about 48 hours of tough driving. Heavy flooding makes this drive unpredictable and dangerous in the rainy season during the months of April to June. ==References== Category:Geography of Guyana Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands Category:Ecoregions of South America ",
