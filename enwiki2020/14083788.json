It was the second rebellion led against the Le, following an uprising led by Tr\u1ea7n Tu\u00e2n in 1511.Keith Weller Taylor, John K. Whitmore Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts1995 Page 128 \"However, in the Hong-thuan (1509-1516) and Quang-thieu (1516-1522) periods, the state fell into many troubles. . . . Men like Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o and Trinh Tuy tore up the countryside.

Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o led an uprising in support of his claim to be a descendant of a Tr\u1ea7n king and also a reincarnation of the god Indra. His army managed to capture the capital briefly and forced the L\u00ea king to flee south.145 Tr\u1ea7n Cao's first base ...\" == Background == The L\u00ea Dynasty was established by Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i in 1428 after expelling the Ming Dynasty of China, which had occupied Annam. In 1460, one of his successors, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng, rose to the throne, beginning what was regarded as a golden age in Vietnamese history. During his rule of 37 years, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng instituted wide-ranging political and structural organisation of the country, implementing a Confucian model of government, introducing a mandarin system of government, expanding education, science, and art. He also expanded \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's territory substantially. At the time, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was confined to the area around the Red River Delta, but L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng expanded \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's army and expanded south towards Hu\u1ebf in what is now central Vietnam by conquering Champa territory. He also pushed westwards into the hills against the Tai. However, after his death, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t fell into disarray as a succession of weak emperors came and went, and palace intrigue crippled the country. This caused public discontent and set the scene for popular uprising. The first significant rebellion, that of Tran Tuan in 1511, is largely lost to history. However, it is known that he was a charismatic figure who quickly gathered thousands of followers in eastern H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a and western S\u01a1n T\u00e2y provinces, and moved them directly against the capital Th\u0103ng Long, now modern-day Hanoi. On arrival they defeated the army of Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n, the head of aristocratic the Tr\u1ecbnh family which was part of the ruling dynasty. The royalists left Th\u0103ng Long defenceless and its people in panic. Shortly after, Tuan was killed by unlucky chance and his rebels were massacred. He was reported to have been dressed in red at the time, suggesting that he may have been a Taoist sorcerer. One of his followers rebelled again in the same region the following year but was isolated and defeated. == Uprising == Like the Tran Tuan revolt of 1511, Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o's rebellion was also regarded as a simple peasant rebellion. Contrary views hold that both were revolts of the peripheral powers against the central administration led by charismatic figures bent on striking directly at the political and symbolic heart of the L\u00ea Dynasty. These two uprisings shared a pattern that set them apart from virtually all later Vietnamese peasant rebellions, which were much more locally oriented. Although they were clearly opposed to central control, later rebellions generally focused their discontent on local representatives by attacking district and provincial posts. They usually roamed the countryside intimidating landlords and pillaging opposing villages, allowing government forces in the capital enough time to organize an effective response. The Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o rebellion exhibited none of these characteristics. Cao based his bid for the throne on a combination of genealogical and spiritual platform that balanced maternal and paternal lineage and doctrinal Buddhist and folk elements. C\u1ea3o claimed direct descent from the founder of the former Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty and membership of the family of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's mother. Spiritually, he proclaimed himself as an incarnation of Indra and as the fulfillment of a popular prophecy. This combination quickly gave rise to a large following in his home district of Thuy Duong and the adjacent \u0110\u00f4ng Tri\u1ec1u, where \"all bowed down to him like grass before the wind\". In early 1516, C\u1ea3o recruited fighters at Quynh Lam Pagoda in \u0110\u00f4ng Tri\u1ec1u, a religious site reputed to have miraculous powers. After shaving their heads, he marched them unopposed, ten thousand strong, through the Kinh Bac districts of Que Duong and Ti\u00ean Du, down to the plains of Gia L\u00e2m to T\u1eeb Li\u00eam in S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Province. This march took little more than ten days. With the insurgents only separated from the capital by the river, Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n murdered the emperor L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c and fled with his puppet successor L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng, leaving the capital undefended. This time, chaos ensued. First a rival general, Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng D\u1ee5 of the Nguy\u1ec5n, turned his army loose to raze and loot. Then the inhabitants of the capital seized their chance to loot the palaces and administrative buildings of the hated former king, T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c. Finally, Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o's forces marched into the capital, destroying the L\u00ea dynastic temple and proclaiming a new reign. These events dealt a heavy blow to L\u00ea prestige and legitimacy, as well as its capacity to rule. The court annals noted that \"After Tran Cao entered the Capital and the tan mieu (the dynastic temple) was sacked, after [Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng D\u1ee5's army] rebelled and the Capital was deserted\", they wrote, \"seeing this was enough to know that the Le could no longer prosper\". Even when the Tr\u1ecbnh and Nguyen generals decided to combine against the rebels that threatened their privileges, it took months to push the rebels back to their H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng-Kinh Bac border stronghold. There they fought at least one major battle, at Sung Nghiem, before retreating to a Kinh Bac area which they controlled until the royal forces finally overcame them in 1521. Before that, Tr\u1ea7n C\u1ea3o had already transferred power to his son and become a monk. He then disappeared into the countryside, notwithstanding a reward of three hundred taels of gold and two thousand ares of land for his capture. The failure to apprehend him was despite the efforts of the populace who might have sought it, blaming him for the high death toll in \u0110\u00f4ng Tri\u1ec1u, Giap Son, Yen Phong, Ti\u00ean Du, and Dong Ngan caused by starvation after vengeful L\u00ea royalists razed the area. He is believed to have died in far north-eastern Kinh Bac (later L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Province). At the end of the seventeenth century, nearly two hundred years later, three villages in B\u1ea3o L\u1ed9c district still worshipped his cult. == References == ==Sources== * ==External links== * Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu (Complete history record of Great Viet), part regards to the Tr\u1ea7n Cao rebellion.
