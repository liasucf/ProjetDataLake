    "text": "The Gay Anties is a 1947 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng and written by Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce. The short was released on February 15, 1947.. The title is a play on word to the Gay Nineties, a phrase that references 1890's United States. ==Plot== A colony of ants surreptitiously invade a young couple's park picnic in the 1890s and contrive to steal their food. The gags include a scene in which the ants, frustrated three times in their efforts to make off with a sandwich, spread mustard on the back of the girlfriend's hand and trick the boyfriend into biting it, and one in which a female ant sings an overly melodramatic song (\"Time Waits for No One\") which gets the other ants to run for cover. ==References== ==External links== * Internet Movie Database article at * Big Cartoon Database article at Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.
