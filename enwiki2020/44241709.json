Russell Nelson Nelson earned his bachelor's degree in business and economics from Pacific Union College in Napa Valley, California, and a Master of Business Administration and Ph.D in finance from the University of California Los Angeles.Preliminary Inventory of the Office of the President Records, 1931-1991 (J. Russell Nelson), Arizona State University) From 1961-1970, Nelson served as an associate professor in finance at the University of Minnesota.Nelson, J. Russell. \"Price Effects in Rights Offerings.\" The Journal of Finance 20.4 (December 1965): 647. In 1970, Nelson moved to become vice provost and professor in finance at the University of Colorado Boulder. During his first stint at the university he was rapidly promoted, to associate provost (in 1971), vice president for budgets and planning (1972-74), vice president of administration (1974-77) until becoming acting chancellor in 1977 and chancellor in 1978. ===ASU presidency=== ASU West (Fletcher Library pictured) In 1981, Nelson became the fourteenth president of Arizona State University.The New ASU Story: J. Russell Nelson Under Nelson, the university focused on education, upgrading its computer infrastructure, and expanding to a second campus. Nelson's presidency was marked by a combative tenure with the athletics department, which fell into disrepute after losing seasons and ethics scandals.Tracy Dodds, \"TROUBLE AT ASU: Scandals in Sun Devil Athletic Department Bring Reform\" , Los Angeles Times June 18, 1985 However, Nelson oversaw the construction of the Karsten Golf Course and started the first efforts to bring a Super Bowl to the Phoenix area. In 1988, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized funding for a Computing and Network Services Building, which was billed as a \"computing union\" for students to have access to technology for their classes. The building did not break ground until February 1991, two years after Nelson departed the university. Nelson also brought the university to western Maricopa County, a vision first seen by G. Homer Durham in the 1960s. ASU West opened in 1984, and ground was broken in 1986 on the permanent campus facility. The university also grew more adept at fundraising. In 1984, work was completed on an expansion to the College of Business Administration and a new research building for the school of engineering. Initiated in the late 1980s, the Campaign for ASU raised more than $75 million and led to the construction of a profusion of new buildings toward the end of Nelson's tenure, including an expanded Hayden Library, a second Memorial Union expansion and an additional building for the College of Architecture. One of these buildings, the Fine Arts Center designed by Antoine Predock, was named for Nelson and his wife Bonita.ASU Tempe Campus Tour: Fine Arts Center Research grants also doubled from 1981 to 1989. Nelson resigned in 1989 to return to Boulder and lead CU's College of Business Administration.ASU Insight, July 3, 1989 Richard Peck, a former English professor and then-provost and vice president of academic affairs, was named as interim president, serving until the installation of Lattie F. Coor on January 1, 1990. Nelson retired from academia in 1992. Nelson died at his Tempe home on March 23, 2016 of complications of Alzheimer's disease. ==References== Category:University of Minnesota faculty Category:Leaders of the University of Colorado Boulder Category:Presidents of Arizona State University Category:1929 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Pacific Union College alumni Category:UCLA Anderson School of Management alumni ",
