    "text": "\"You Got Me\" is a song by the hip hop band The Roots, featuring vocals by Erykah Badu (who sings the chorus) and Eve, then known as Eve of Destruction, who raps the second verse but does not appear in the music video. The track was released as a single from the band's fourth studio album, Things Fall Apart (1999). \"You Got Me\" was co-written by musician Jill Scott, who recorded vocals for the song's chorus and bridge. Her part was subsequently re-recorded by Badu at the insistence of MCA Records, who wanted a higher-profile collaboration for the album's official lead single (at the time, Scott was relatively unknown outside Philadelphia). When the group later went on tour, Scott joined them during performances of the song. The original version was later released on the 2005 compilation Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding the Roots, Volume One. The song garnered The Roots and Badu a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2000. ==Music video== The music video for \"You Got Me\" was directed by Charles Stone III and features a cameo from rapper and actor Common. ==Track listing== #\"You Got Me\" #\"Adrenaline!\" #\"New Year's @ Jay Dee's\" #\"You Got Me\" (Me Tienes Remix) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Charts (1999) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1999 singles Category:Erykah Badu songs Category:Eve (rapper) songs Category:Songs written by Scott Storch Category:The Roots songs Category:1998 songs Category:Songs written by Jill Scott Category:MCA Records singles ",
