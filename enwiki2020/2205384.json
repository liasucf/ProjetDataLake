Zarchi's first film as director was I Spit on Your Grave a.k.a. Day of the Woman (1978), which starred Camille Keaton, whom he married the following year. The story of a woman seeking violent revenge on the men who raped her, Grave was considered controversial at the time of its release and suffered censorship in various countries.

Zarchi's sophomore effort came seven years later with the revenge-drama, set in New York City, Don't Mess with My Sister (a.k.a. \u201cFamily and Honor\u201d) which was nominated by the American Film Institute, The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard Magazine as Best Fiction Feature Length Film on video. He acted as the Executive Producer for the movie Holy Hollywood, a comedy-drama about wannabe actors, starring Mickey Rooney. Holy Hollywood was written and directed by Meir\u2019s son, Terry Zarchi, who also made a documentary, Growing Up With I Spit On Your Grave, planned for release in conjunction with the launching of the sequel in 2018.
