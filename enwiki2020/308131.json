    "text": "Jackie Mason (born Yacov Moshe Maza; June 9, 1928) is an American stand-up comedian and film and television actor. He is ranked #63 on Comedy Central's 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all-time. His 1986 one-man show The World According to Me won a Special Tony Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, an Ace Award, an Emmy Award, and a Grammy nomination. Later, his 1988 special Jackie Mason on Broadway won another Emmy Award (for outstanding writing) and another Ace Award, and his 1991 voice-over of Rabbi Hyman Krustofski in The Simpsons episode \"Like Father, Like Clown\" won Mason a third Emmy Award. He has written and performed in six one-man shows on Broadway. Known for his delivery and voice, as well as his use of innuendo and pun, Mason's often culturally grounded humor has been described as irreverent and sometimes politically incorrect.Zeke Jarvis (2015). Make 'em Laugh! American Humorists of the 20th and 21st CenturiesNorman H. Finkelstein (2010). Jewish Comedy Stars: Classic to Cutting Edge A critic for Time wrote that he spoke to audiences: \"with the Yiddish locutions of an immigrant who just completed a course in English. By mail.\"Eli Lederhendler, Gabriel N. Finder (2016). A Club of Their Own: Jewish Humorists and the Contemporary World, Oxford University Press ==Early life== Jackie Mason was born Yacov Moshe Maza on June 9, 1928 (according to 1940 NYC census), in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the fourth and last son (and first one born in the United States) in a family of six children of strict Orthodox Jews.Karen Heller (January 8, 1987). \"A Really Big Broadway Show; Jackie Mason`s Hit Buries Ed Sullivan Flap\" , The Chicago Tribune Mason comes from a long line of rabbis, which included his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and his great-great grandfather.\"A Mason by any Other Name,\" Jewish Book World (2006). His father Eli and his mother had both been born in Minsk, and had emigrated to the U.S. in the 1920s with the rest of Mason's family; his father died in 1959.Robert Wiener (October 12, 2006). \"One Jew Talking: Jackie Mason heads to Newark,\" New Jersey Jewish NewsJackie Mason, Ira Berkow (1991). How to Talk Jewish, Macmillan A Jewish refugee organization helped his father find a position in Sheboygan, as it needed a rabbi. When Mason was five years old his family moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, largely so that he and his siblings could pursue a yeshiva education, where he grew up on Henry Street, Rutgers Street, and Norfolk Street.Ken Gross (February 23, 1987). \"Too Much of a Ham to Remain a Rabbi, Broadway's Jackie Mason is Now the Toast of the Town\", People\u00b7 Page 359, The Los Angeles Times, August 13, 1978 There, his parents and their friends all spoke Yiddish. According to U.S. census report from New York City 1940 census, it states Jacob Maza (Jackie Mason's birthname) was born in 1928. As a teenager, Mason worked as a busboy at resorts in the Borscht Belt in New York's Catskill Mountains. He recalled: \"Twenty minutes, at the Pearl Lake Hotel. I broke all the dishes. They made me a lifeguard. 'But I can't swim,' I told the owner. 'Don't tell the guests,' he says.\" In 1953 Mason graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in his double major of English and Sociology from the City College of New York.Joseph Dorinson (2015), Kvetching and Shpritzing: Jewish Humor in American Popular Culture, McFarland At age 18 he became a cantor, and at age 25 he received semikhah from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and was ordained a rabbi (as his three brothers, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been), in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He led congregations as their rabbi in Weldon, North Carolina and Beth Israel Congregation in Latrobe.Murry Frymer (November 12, 1991). \"Jackie Mason Finally Reaches Stardom\", Deseret NewsAdam Reinherz. \"End of an era; Soon all that will remain will be Beth Israel's history legacy\", The Jewish Chronicle He said that in synagogue, \"I started telling more and more jokes, and after a while, a lot of gentiles would come to the congregation just to hear the sermons.\" Three years later, after his father died, he resigned from his job as a rabbi in a synagogue to become a comedian because, he says, \"Somebody in the family had to make a living.\"\"All About ... Jackie Mason\", Jackie Mason; The Official Site, Retrieved July 14, 2014 ==Career== ===Early years=== Mason has written most of his own material. A sampling of his humor is his commentary on doctors: \"That's a great profession, a doctor. Where else can you ask a woman to get undressed and then send the bill to her husband?\" And his commentary on what is important in life: \"Money is not important. Love is important. Fortunately, I love money.\"Lawrence J. Epstein (2008). The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish Comedians in America As well as his ruminations on pleasing people: \"You can't please everyone. I have a girlfriend. I think she's the most wonderful person in the world. That's to me. But to my wife ...\"Craig R. Whitney (November 23, 2008).\"Britain Imports Mason Just for Fun\", The New York TimesAubrey J. Sher, The Stand-Up Comedy Festival: Send In The Clowns And on trust: \"My grandfather always said that I shouldn't watch my money. That I should watch my health. So while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather.\" And on fidelity: \"Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe.\" He was a comedian at the Fieldston Hotel in Swan Lake, New York, in the summer of 1955.Keith Loria (October 20, 2016).\"Howard Theatre welcomes legendary comedian\", Fairfax Times Mason was let go because his act was considered too far ahead of its time. The patrons had not been exposed to a comic who seemed to be ridiculing them. A few years later, Don Rickles came along, but at that point audiences had become open to this type of humor throughout the Borscht Belt. He adopted his stage name after appearing on the Barry Gray radio show.Jackie Mason - Biography, Billboard He performed at New York City nightclubs (where he was earning as much as $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) a week), and on The Steve Allen Show, his first national TV appearance; in 1962, and the Tonight Show with Steve Allen, as well as on The Perry Como Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Gary Moore Show. The William Morris Agency advised him in 1962 to take elocution lessons so that he could shed his heavy Jewish accent, but he refused. 1968 ad for the Jackie Mason Show Mason made several appearances as a guest on The Ed Sullivan Show during the 1960s. He claimed to have been on the first episode to feature the American television debut of the Beatles, although research does not bear this fact out.Ed Sullivan Show episode guide, thetvdb.com Mason revealed during his appearance on the BBC show Desert Island Discs that at the time he did not think much of the group, referring to them as \"four kids in search of a voice who needed haircuts\". In 1962 he came out with his initial LP record, a best-seller entitled I'm the Greatest Comedian in the World, Only Nobody Knows It Yet, followed by I Want to Leave You with the Words of a Great Comedian.Bob Rolontz (August 10, 1963).\"Clay Talks a Nice Fight Disk,\" Billboard === \"Middle finger\" incident (1964) === On October 18, 1964, in an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Mason allegedly gave host Ed Sullivan the finger on air. Footage of the incident shows Mason in the middle of doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, who had placed himself directly behind the camera, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by holding up two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, and to cut his act short, as the program was about to cut away due to having been partly pre-empted by an impromptu speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson that the show carried. Mason began working his own fingers into his act to make fun of the situation, and pointed toward Sullivan with an index finger, a thumb, but not (as Sullivan mistakenly believed) his middle finger. Sullivan was infuriated by this, and banned Mason from future appearances on the show, canceling Mason's $45,000 ($ in current dollar terms), six-appearance contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger; he later said that he had not heard of the middle finger gesture at that time. To clear his name, Mason filed a libel suit on the grounds that Sullivan had defamed him at the New York Supreme Court. That court dismissed most of Mason's complaint. Both Mason and Sullivan appealed to the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division (which reinstated three additional causes of action against Sullivan) in June 1966.Barry Avrich (2016). Moguls, Monsters, and Madmen: An Uncensored Life in Show Business He was nevertheless banned from the show for a period of time. Sullivan asserted that Mason was unpredictable and could not be trusted. Because of Sullivan's influence, he was branded as unreliable, volatile, and obscene, and he failed to get substantial TV work for the next two decades. There was no ruling on the merits, merely a determination that Mason's suit could proceed and that he would be given an opportunity to prove his claim. Mason was given a single comeback appearance on Sullivan's TV program two years later, and Sullivan publicly apologized to him, but the damage was done. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, \"It is a great thrill ... and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again.\" Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; February 25, 1968; November 24, 1968; July 22, 1969; and August 31, 1969. Mason later said: \"It took 20 years to overcome what happened in one minute\". ===1965\u201385=== In 1969, Mason made his Broadway theater debut as Jewish widower Nat Weiss in the comedy play A Teaspoon Every Four Hours, which he wrote with Mike Mortman. It held the Broadway record of 97 previews and closed after its official opening performance (a preview record succeeded by Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark with its 182 previews prior to opening). He also appeared in the films The Jerk (1979) and History of the World, Part I (1981).Joseph A. Comm (2015). Legendary Locals of Latrobe, Arcadia Publishing ===1986\u2013present=== In 1986, Mason made a triumphant return to Broadway in the two-year run of The World According to Me which ran for 367 performances in its first run and 203 performances in its second run at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, his first of several one-man theatrical shows.Dan Dietz (2016). The Complete Book of 1990s Broadway Musicals It was well received both by critics and the public; Frank Rich, the generally harsh reviewer of The New York Times, wrote: \"So sue me ... Mason was very, very funny\". It won a Special Tony Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, an Ace Award, an Emmy Award, and a Grammy nomination.Comic Genius: Portraits of Funny People, 2015.Romi Oliverio (September 21, 2009). \"Jackie Mason's One-Man Show, 'No Holds Barred', To Play Los Angeles' Wadsworth Theatre\", Broadway World His special Jackie Mason on Broadway won an Emmy Award for outstanding writing and an Ace Award.

Critic Mel Gussow of The New York Times remarked on the \"exact meeting\" between performance and material in which Mason engaged in a comic attack on everyone, including himself, cutting them all down to size. In 1992, Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his voice-over of Rabbi Hyman Krustofski in The Simpsons episode \"Like Father, Like Clown\",Basile, Nancy.

One of his Broadway shows, his two-act Politically Incorrect (1994\u201395) which ran for 347 performances at Broadway's John Golden Theater. Critic John Simon of Time wrote: \"His method is hyperbole and reductio ad absurdum, but always informed by bitter reason. His irony is a spotlight illuminating our absurdities; his zingers are scalpels laying bare the sickness under the skin. There is a unifying thrust, a focus, a structure: an attack on both liberal hypocrisy and conservative apathy, and on the climate of political correctness that makes it impossible to attack anyone but WASPs. ... Mason is a true satirist in the mold of ... Mark Twain . ... \"John Simon (April 18, 1994).\"Two Stand-Ups; One Standout,\" New York Magazine It was performed during the same period that Bill Maher's late-night, half-hour political TV talk show Politically Incorrect was on the air. Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason's production, which was dismissed as frivolous. Mason was able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television interfaith sitcom called Chicken Soup alongside Lynn Redgrave. Mason also put on the Broadway one-man shows Love thy Neighbor (1996\u201397) which ran for 225 performances at the Booth Theatre (critic Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times described Mason's routines as \"roaringly funny\"), Much Ado About Everything (1999\u20132000; nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment) which ran for 183 performances at the John Golden Theatre (critic Van Gelder of The New York Times described Mason as \"convulsing audiences\"), Prune Danish (2002; nominated for a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event), Jackie Mason: Freshly Squeezed (2005; for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance), and The Ultimate Jew (2008).\"Just the Facts: List of 2003 Tony Award Winners\", Playbill In a 2005 poll to find the Comedian's Comedian, Mason was voted among the top-50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

January 29, 2003. Mason and Raoul Felder wrote, \"We have paralyzed ourselves by our sickening fear of World Opinion, which is why we find it impossible to face one simple fact: We will never win this war unless we immediately threaten to drive every Arab out of Israel if the killing doesn't stop.\" They added: \"We are brain-dead if we accept the idea that we have to guess which Arab is our next killer. We are not obligated to victimize ourselves by letting the Arabs play Russian roulette with Jewish lives. Israelis are constantly asked the same obnoxious question: 'How can you throw the Arabs out? where would they go?' The answer is, if they don't care whom they kill, why are we obligated to care where they go?\" ==Personal life== On August 14, 1991, Mason married his 37-year-old manager Jyll Rosenfeld.Comedian Jackie Mason Ends Bachelor Days At 57 , Orlando Sentinel Sheba Mason, born in 1985, is the daughter of Jackie Mason.Oy!

(Schvartze is a Yiddish term for a black person). He later apologized. In 2009, Mason also referred to Barack Obama as a schvartze during one of his stand-up routines, which prompted members of the audience to walk out.Bill Hutchiinson. \"Comments about President Obama by Jackie Mason draw racism charges\".

The group responded to the suit by saying, \"Shame on him for getting so upset about this.\" The lawsuit was settled in 2006, with Jews for Jesus apologizing. On March 30, 2012, Mason said that a friend at the time, Kaoru Suzuki-McMullen, attacked him while leaving his apartment on West 57th Street in Manhattan. Suzuki-McMullen said she was attacked by Mason, but she was arrested. On May 12, both sides agreed to drop the matter and all charges were dropped against Suzuki-McMullen. ==Works== ===Selected TV, film and radio roles=== *The Ed Sullivan Show (1961\u201368) \u2013 frequent guest appearances *Sleeper (1973) \u2013 Voice of robot tailor (uncredited) *The Stoolie (1974) \u2013 Roger Pitman * The Jerk (1979) \u2013 Harry Hartounian * History of the World, Part I (1981) \u2013 Jew #1 * Jackie Mason Radio Show live from Rum Runner Bay, Miami Beach (1982) \u2013 produced by John L.
