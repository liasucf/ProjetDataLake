    "text": "Haughton (or Haughton Moss) is a village and civil parish which lies northwest of Nantwich in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. According to the 2001 Census, its population was 223, reducing to 204 at the 2011 Census, and has four fully active farms. ==Landmarks== The Nags Head public house, a half timbered building dating back to 1629, is situated in the village. A war memorial mounted on a brick plinth on Long Lane was originally from neighbouring Radmore Green chapel. It was rescued by local residents Derek Rogers and Tom Dawson when the chapel was converted to a dwelling. It is dedicated to those associated with the chapel and the village, who fought in the First World War. Every year, Haughton Hall gardens are opened to the public, it features a medium-sized garden; filled with rhododendrons, azaleas, shrubs, a rock garden, a lake with a temple, a waterfall and a collection of ornamental trees. ==Archaeology== A 3 cm long silver gilt crucifix was discovered in a field near the village in 2002. The artifact, likely to have been worn around the neck on a chain, was dated as late fourteenth or early fifteenth century by experts at the British Museum. ==Governance== As the population is small, instead of having a parish council, the civil parish holds a regular (about four times a year) parish meeting for residents. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 ==See also== *Listed buildings in Haughton, Cheshire ==References== ==External links== * BBC Domesday Reloaded - http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-356000-354000 Category:Villages in Cheshire Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire ",
