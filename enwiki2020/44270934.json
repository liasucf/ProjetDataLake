The facilities at this location include an office building, two clear wells, one wellhouse, an aeration chamber, a water wheel, and a c. 1980 brick outbuilding and steel watertower. The main office building was built in 1936\u201337 with funding from the Public Works Administration, a Depression-era jobs program, while many of the other facilities were built c. 1930. The office building is rambling T-shaped structure, with sections that are either one or two stories in height. It is built of red brick in the then-popular Spanish Revival style. The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lee County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Water supply infrastructure on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Neoclassical architecture in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1930 Category:Buildings and structures in Lee County, Arkansas Category:Former pumping stations Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lee County, Arkansas ",
