It is a janya r\u0101gam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven swaras (musical notes). It is said to evoke intense self-reflection to the listener and Karu\u1e47a rasa (pathos). ==Structure and Lakshana== D1 only in avarohanam * : * : (notes used in this scale are shuddha rishabham, shuddha madhyamam, panchamam, shuddha dhaivatham, kaisiki nishadham) Svadhya is considered a janya r\u0101gam of Ratnangi, the 2nd Melakarta r\u0101gam. This Raga was created by composer Rajan Somasundaram. ==Popular compositions== Here are some popular kritis composed in Svadhya. *Maya- The Reflection of Self by Rajan Somasundaram *Ashtavakra Gita- Self Realization Musical by Rajan Somasundaram ==Related r\u0101gams== This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this r\u0101gam. ===Scale similarities=== *Revati ragam has similar aurohana but a different avarohana, especially the presence of shuddha dhaivatham makes Svadhya raga a complex one and lends a different color.Raganidhi by P.
