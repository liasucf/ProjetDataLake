    "text": "Satya Narayan is a deva form of Vishnu who is worshipped by Hindus, mainly in the Indian states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam, Manipur and Tripura. His avatar is Krishna. Satya Narayan is part of a triad on the ratnavedi (jewelled platform). ==Festivals== Satya Narayan is honoured at the Saty Narayan Ji Temple (mandir) in Nabha, at the Rath Yatra Nabha, and as part of the Holi festival. The large chariots of Jagannath (another aspect of Vishnu) which are pulled during a Ratha-Yatra form the etymological origin of the English word juggernaut. ==Puja== The present puja to the deva originated in the syncretism of Hindu and Sufi traditions in Bengal during the Middle Ages, when the Hindu Satya Narayan became the Muslim Satya Pir. The puja is also performed by some Buddhists in Bangladesh. ==Gallery== File:Chariot Pulling.jpg|alt=A crowd pulling two large vehicles|Ratha-Yatra chariots in Puri File:Jagannath 4 - Pahandi bije.jpg|alt=Worshippers at a shrine|Worshippers in Puri Image:Vishnu.jpg|alt=see caption|Painting of Vishnu seated on a lotus Image:SNpoojaprep.jpg|alt=Decorative pitcher and food|A kalasha and other puja items File:Satyanarayan Pooja.jpg|alt=Plants, a pitcher and food items|Satya Narayan puja ==References== Category:Forms of Vishnu ",
