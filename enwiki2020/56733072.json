The two fought but broke the locket, making Griselle lose it after the two went their separate ways. She spent years using her science to replicate its powers but failed, until the day when she discovered Polly Pocket had found it and reactivated its powers. She and Gwen now try to take the locket to conquer Littleton by shrinking its citizens and trapping them in a model city called \"Grandeville\". She eventually gets arrested at the end of episode 13 (11 in production order), after her plan to become the town's new mayor, steal Polly's locket, and shrink the Littleton while covering it in an energy bubble failed, and Nicholas helped Lila and Shani expose Griselle's secret plans to the world. But after doing community service, she resumes her hunt for the locket while also wanting revenge on Polly and her friends, starting with episode 15 onwards. * Gwen Grande (voiced by Rhona Rees) - Griselle Grande's dim-witted granddaughter and Polly's rival inside and outside of school. In episode 7, \"Con Job\", she actually helps the girls escape to avoid Griselle ruining their one day off from Pocket-hunting. * Paranormal Patty (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) - A paranormal investigator whose only appearance so far is in \"Pocket Poltergeist\" when Pierce, believing to have been haunted by a ghost calls her in, unaware it was the Pocket Posse pulling a prank. Aside from her equipment almost ratting out Polly's secret, she tried to destroy the Pocket house in an attempt to get rid of the ghost before Polly arranged for her and Pierce to \"banish\" it, (really Shani via voice-acting and special effects), with a spirit dance. * Mr. Scheeman - A shady businessman who conned Nicholas into journeying to Almost Dead-Man's Island, hoping the boy's vlog would spread rumors about a haunted temple and keep competing businesses from taking root there. His magnet crane caused Polly's powers to glitch until Shani found and disabled it. He stole a sample of genuine \"Bigfoot\" hair from Nick until Shani stole it back in secret. ==Episodes== ==Broadcast== Additional broadcasters are: Nine Network in Australia, POP in United Kingdom, RTL Telekids in Netherlands, Kidzone TV in Baltics, Lagard\u00e8re's Gulli and Tiji in France, Gulli in Africa, Gulli Girl and Carousel in Russia, TeleTOON+ in Poland, AMC Minimax in Eastern Europe, Vtmkzoom in Belgium, Canal Panda in Portugal, Turner in (Italy, Middle East, Turkey & Greece), Star Channel in Greece, KidZ in Israel, SABC in South Africa, Super RTL in Germany and Discovery Kids in Latin America. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2010s Canadian animated television series Category:2018 Canadian television series debuts Category:American flash animated television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated science fiction television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:Canadian flash animated television series Category:Canadian children's animated adventure television series Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian children's animated science fiction television series Category:Canadian children's animated action television series Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Family Channel (Canadian TV network) original programming Category:Family Jr. shows Category:Universal Kids shows Category:Television series about size change Category:Television series about revenge Category:Television series by DHX Media Category:Television series by Mattel Creations Category:Magical girl television series Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about families ",
