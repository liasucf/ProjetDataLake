    "text": "Mutton's Mill (also known as Manor House Mill) is a windpump located on the Halvergate Marshes in the detached parish of Freethorpe within The Broads in the English county of Norfolk. The mill is a Grade II* listed building and is east of the village of Halvergate and north-west of Berney Arms. It lies close to the route of the Weavers' Way long-distance footpath. == History == Mutton's Mill as it looks today The mill was last worked in 1947 by Mr Fred Mutton (hence the name Mutton's Mill) and was used to drain the surrounding marshland into the Halvergate Fleet. The mill is now in private ownership and in 1984 a new cap and six-bladed fantail followed by one pair of patent sails in 1998. The mill's restored fantail was blown off the mill in 2005; however, it has since been replaced during 2008. From time to time it is possible to see the sails turning. == References == ==External links== * Information regarding many of the windpumps on Halvergate Marshes Category:Windmills of the Norfolk Broads Category:Tower mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Norfolk ",
