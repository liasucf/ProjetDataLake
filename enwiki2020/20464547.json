Listed at , 195 lb., Murff batted and threw right-handed. He attended Gettysburg College. A native of Burlington, Texas, Murff started his professional baseball career in A and AA ball. On June 8, , while pitching for the Texas City Texans, he threw a no-hitter against the Harlingen Capitals. A year later he pitched 19\u2154 innings of a 20-inning game, in a lost cause against the Texarkana Bears, who defeated the Texans, 3\u20132. Then, in 1955 was selected both the Minor League Player of the Year by The Sporting News and Texas League Pitcher of the Year after going 27\u201311 for the Dallas Eagles. Murff entered the majors in 1956 with the Braves as a 35-year-old rookie, having been signed by Milwaukee scout Earle W. Halstead. In a story chronicled in Murff's biography \"The Scout\", Halstead negotiated with Dick Burnett, owner of the Dallas Eagles in the Texas League, where Murff played. The two sides reached an impasse until Halstead proposed a game of gin rummy with the winner setting the terms of the trade. Halstead won and the Braves paid Burnett $40,000 and three players from the 40 man roster to obtain Murff's contract. In part of two seasons, he posted a 2\u20132 record with a 4.65 ERA and three saves in 26 appearances, including two starts, giving up 26 earned runs on 56 hits and 18 walks while striking out 31 in 50 \u2153 innings of work. Following his majors career, Murff coached in the minors and managed the 1960 Jacksonville Braves of the South Atlantic League. As a scout for the New York Mets, he discovered and signed future Hall of Famer pitcher Nolan Ryan and All-Star catcher Jerry Grote. Ryan, later named president of the Texas Rangers, noted his friendship with Murff in his 1999 Hall of Fame induction speech. In the early 1970s, Murff helped start the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor baseball program, and retired to Tyler, Texas in 1991 after serving 34 years as a scout. He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Texas Scouts Association Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 1994 the UMHB's ballpark was named in his honour, Red Murff Field. Murff died in a Tyler nursing home at the age of 87. ==External links== *Baseball Reference (Minors) *Baseball Almanac *BR Bullpen * *Obituary *Retrosheet *SABR BioProject *Temple Daily Telegram news *Texas Baseball Hall of Fame *TSN Minor League Player of the Year *Venezuelan Baseball League Category:1921 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Atlanta Braves scouts Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Baton Rouge Red Sticks players Category:Gettysburg Bullets baseball players Category:Dallas Eagles players Category:Houston Astros scouts Category:Industriales de Valencia players Category:Jacksonville Braves players Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Mary Hardin\u2013Baylor Crusaders baseball coaches Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Montreal Expos scouts Category:Nashville Vols players Category:New York Mets scouts Category:Texas City Texans players Category:Tyler East Texans players Category:Wichita Braves players Category:People from Milam County, Texas ",
