    "text": "Lorkovi\u0107\u2013Voki\u0107 plot () was a mid-1944 attempt initiated by the Minister of Interior, Mladen Lorkovi\u0107 and Minister of Armed Forces, Ante Voki\u0107, to form a coalition government with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), abandon the Axis powers and align the Independent State of Croatia with the Allies with the help of the Croatian Home Guard. The plan originated from the HSS which was also involved in the negotiations with the Allies. The plot ended with massive arrests and the execution of major plotters, including Lorkovi\u0107 and Voki\u0107. ==Situation in Europe== On 24 August 1942, the Germans launched an attack on Stalingrad. The battle of Stalingrad ended in German defeat on 2 February 1943. After this victory, the war turned in the Soviets' favour. The Allied invasion of Sicily was launched on 9 July 1943, and not long after, Benito Mussolini was overthrown and arrested on 25 July. On the same day, Italian king Victor Emmanuel named Pietro Badoglio as Italy's new Prime Minister and on 8 September 1943, signed the unconditional capitulation of Italy. On 6 June 1944 the Allies launched the D-Day landings on the German-occupied coast of Normandy. ===Coup attempts among the Axis nations=== Because of defeats that Axis forces suffered from the Allies, some Axis nations tried to change sides. On 23 August 1944, as the Red Army approached Romania, Romanian King Michael staged a coup against dictator Ion Antonescu and joined the Allies. Not long after the coup in Romania, the Fatherland Front in Bulgaria overthrew the pro- German Bulgarian government on 2 September 1944. Three days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria, soon occupying the northeastern part of the country. The Bulgarian Army was ordered not to offer any resistance. Bulgaria joined the Allies on 8 September 1944. On 15 October 1944, the regent of Hungary, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, announced that he had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. In response, the Germans launched Operation Panzerfaust, arrested Horthy and installed Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi, leader of the fascist Arrow Cross Party, as leader of Hungary. Hungary would continue to fight the Red Army on the Axis side until the end of the war. ==Preparations for the coup== August Ko\u0161uti\u0107, Vice President of the HSS Ljudevit Toma\u0161i\u0107, Deputy Secretary of the HSS Vladko Ma\u010dek, the President of the Croatian Peasant Party, thought that the British would support the democratic and anti-communist Croatian state. Because of that, he thought that the Allies would eventually land on the Dalmatian coast and support his party as democratic and anti-communist. He also assumed that the Croatian Home Guard would support the HSS once the invasion of Dalmatia started. Nevertheless, Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107's Serb-dominated Chetniks had a plan directed against both Croats and Communists if the projected Allied invasion of Dalmatia were to occur. The three members of the HSS' leadership, August Ko\u0161uti\u0107, the Vice President; Ljudevit Toma\u0161i\u0107, a deputy secretary and representative who was already in contact with the Allies; and Ivanko Farolfi were assigned the task of carrying out negotiations with the British. Farolfi was the most active and was in charge of maintaining contact with Croatian army officers, party leaders and foreign intelligence services. Mladen Lorkovi\u0107 had a plan to disarm the German army on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), install the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) as the new government, and to call all of the Allied armies to land on the territory of the NDH. He also believed that the HSS would prevent the communists or King Peter II from coming to power. In July 1944, Voki\u0107 held a meeting at which he pointed out that once the Allies invaded the Balkans, the German armed forces would have to be disarmed. The Germans were aware that Croatia could join the Allies. The Luftwaffe's attach\u00e9 in Zagreb on 11 August reported that the Croatian military was becoming increasingly uncooperative towards the Germans. He also noted their request for more arms and ammunition from the German military. Lorkovi\u0107 established contact with the Croatian Peasant Party representatives in Croatia, Ivanko Farolfi, Ljudevit Toma\u0161i\u0107 and August Ko\u0161uti\u0107. Their notion of an Allied invasion of Dalmatia failed to materialize, as Allies had no intention of landing in Dalmatia. Even so, Winston Churchill was sympathetic to the idea of an Allied invasion of the Croatian coast, so he initiated a discussion with Josip Broz Tito about a possible invasion of the Istrian peninsula in August 1944. The representatives of the HSS and Croatian Home Guard offered only promises, while the Yugoslav Partisans were involved in the war, and at the Teheran Conference, the Partisans gained the status of an Allied force. The British did not wanted to risk cooperation with the Partisans, and their involvement in Yugoslavia was already complicated as they dealt with both the Royal Yugoslav government-in-exile and the Communists; the involvement of the Croatian Home Guard and the HSS would complicate the situation even further. The Croatian negotiators with the Allies were Tomo Jan\u010dikovi\u0107, Zenon Adami\u0107 and Ivan Babi\u0107. The British always had a separate meeting with them. The HSS thought that their emissaries were successful in securing the Dalmatian invasion plan. The appointment of Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 as the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in exile and General Ivan Toma\u0161evi\u0107's offer to put his army under Allied command once the invasion began, encouraged the plotters even more. Finally, the Romanian coup and the advance of the Soviet troops led them to believe that the Allies would soon invade Dalmatia. ==End of the plot and arrests== Ante Paveli\u0107, Poglavnik of the Independent State of Croatia, thought that the Germans would win the war with the \"horrible weapons\". He called a meeting of his cabinet to his villa, which was guarded by armed men. A meeting took place on 30 August 1944, and Paveli\u0107 accused both Lorkovi\u0107 and Voki\u0107 of involvement in the plot and treason. Vice President of the Government, D\u017eafer Kulenovi\u0107, and many others defended them, but to no avail. Lorkovi\u0107 and Voki\u0107 were arrested, along with 60 others. Lorkovi\u0107 requested that Paveli\u0107 not do harm the members of the HSS, \"as promised\", while Voki\u0107 defended them in front of Paveli\u0107, asserting that they did everything he ordered them to do. Some of those who were arrested were soon released, while Lorkovi\u0107 and Voki\u0107 were tried, imprisoned, and later executed. ==Conspirators== *Mladen Lorkovi\u0107 - Minister of Internal Affairs *Ante Voki\u0107 - Minister of Armed Forces *Franjo \u0160imi\u0107 - Croatian Home Guard general who was supposed to greet the English and American forces after their arrival on the Dalmatian coastNikica Bari\u0107.
