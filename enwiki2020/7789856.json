    "text": "\"Love Is\" is the title of a 1993 duet written by Tonio K, Michael Caruso and John Keller, and originally recorded and released by American singer and actress Vanessa Williams and American R&B; recording artist Brian McKnight. The single originally appeared on the soundtrack to the television drama series Beverly Hills, 90210; and was also used in the spin-off series Melrose Place. After this exposure, the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming McKnight's breakthrough hit and another hit for Williams. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, where it spent three weeks at the summit. There were two different versions released to radio: the more common mix includes energetic electric guitar performing the solo in the bridge; an alternate, lesser-known mix presents melodic solo piano at the bridge. The edit version was that of the guitar mix, which presented a fade out during the second of the two ending chorus refrains. This mix appears on Brian McKnight's greatest hits album From There to Here: 1989-2002 without the fade, although the piano solo ending is slightly trimmed. The \"piano mix\" also appears on Vanessa Williams's Greatest Hits - The First Ten Years album. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1993) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1993) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |30 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |35 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |21 |} == Cover versions == In 1994, jazz fusion saxophonist Nelson Rangell covered the song for his album Yes, Then Yes. ==References== *The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition, 1996 ==External links== *Discogs * Category:1993 singles Category:Vanessa Williams songs Category:Brian McKnight songs Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Male\u2013female vocal duets Category:Giant Records (Warner) singles Category:1992 songs ",
