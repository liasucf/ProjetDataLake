Murphy is an American virologist and former co-chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. ==Education and career== Brian Murphy was born in 1942. He completed his undergraduate B.S. degree from Wesleyan University in 1964. He then went on to medical training, completing his M.D. in 1969 at the University of Rochester Medical School, and internship the next year at Stanford University Hospital. He moved to the National Institutes of Health in 1970 as a Research Associate in the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases within the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. In 1983, he was promoted to head the respiratory viruses section of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases. In 2001, he became co-chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases with Robert H. Purcell. He retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2010. Brian Murphy administers an intranasal flu vaccine during a 1984 clinical trial Brian Murphy received the inaugural Robert M. Chanock award for lifetime achievements in RSV research at the Respiratory Syncytial Virus 2003 symposium in November 2003.Alexander C.
