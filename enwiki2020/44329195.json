    "text": "Austin Michael Appleby (born June 4, 1993) is an American football coach and former quarterback, who is the current wide receivers coach for the Missouri State Bears. He played college football at Purdue University from 2012 to 2015 for coaches Danny Hope and Darrell Hazell, before graduate transferring to the University of Florida where here he played for coach Jim McElwain in 2016 and played in the Alliance of American Football in 2019. He was a consensus 3-star high school prospect as a senior. ==Early years== Appleby attended Hoover High School in North Canton, Ohio. While at Hoover, Appleby played three sports (baseball, basketball, and football) during his freshman and sophomore years. As a member of the varsity football team in 2009, Appleby served as a backup quarterback for the Vikings, who would go on to lose in the State Semi-Final game. As a junior in 2010, Appleby was named the starting quarterback but eight weeks into the season, he suffered a torn ACL, ending his season. Despite his injury, Appleby was invited to the ESPN RISE Elite 11 Camp in 2011, after qualifying at a regional camp at Ohio State University. Appleby was named the best in chalk talk during the camp. Following his Elite 11 performance, Appleby's recruiting picked up momentum, landing his first power conference scholarship offer from Louisville. Just a few days following the Louisville offer, Appleby was offered by Purdue, and Appleby made his commitment to the Boilermakers on June 29, 2011. ==College career== ===Purdue=== Appleby was redshirted as a true freshman in 2012. In 2013, he appeared in one game as a reserve. In 2014, Purdue had a quarterback position battle in fall practice, this time between Appleby, Danny Etling, and true freshman David Blough. Appleby pushed hard for the starting spot over the entrenched Etling, but fell just short and was named the backup on August 18. Etling would lead Purdue to a 2\u20133 record of the first five games of the season, before Darrell Hazell turned to Appleby to start Purdue's 6th game against Illinois. Appleby led Purdue to a 38\u201327 victory, Hazell's first Big Ten Conference victory. On August 25, 2015, head coach Darrell Hazell named Appleby the starting quarterback for the opening game of the 2015 season. On September 22, 2015, it was announced that Appleby will be replaced as the starting quarterback in favor of redshirt freshman, David Blough. Appleby returned to his starting role when Blough was injured during the November 21, game at Iowa. Following the conclusion of the season, Appleby was given his release to explore transfer options as a graduate student. ===Florida=== On January 4, 2016, Appleby announced his decision to play his final year of college football at the University of Florida as a graduate transfer. Under head coach Jim McElwain, Appleby competed with Luke Del Rio for the starting quarterback position, and lost out to Del Rio. After an injury early in the season to Del Rio, Appleby started seven games for the Gators in the 2016 season. Despite finishing with a 4\u20133 record as a starter, Appleby helped lead Florida to an SEC East title and a berth in the 2016 SEC Championship Game. In the 2017 Outback Bowl and his last game as a Gator, Appleby passed for 222 yards in a 30\u20133 defeat of the Iowa Hawkeyes. ===Statistics=== Appleby's college statistics are as follows: {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center;\" |- |! colspan=\"15\" style=\"background:gray; border:2px solid silver; color:white;\"|NCAA collegiate career statistics |- |! colspan=\"15\" style=\";\" |Purdue Boilermakers |- ! rowspan=2|Season ! rowspan=2|Games ! rowspan=2|Games Started ! rowspan=2|Record ! colspan=7|Passing ! colspan=4|Rushing |- !
