    "text": "Antony Hewish (born 11 May 1924) is a British radio astronomer who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 (together with fellow radio-astronomer Martin Ryle) for his role in the discovery of pulsars. He was also awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1969. ==Early life and education== Hewish attended King's College, Taunton. His undergraduate degree at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, was interrupted by war service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and at the Telecommunications Research Establishment where he worked with Martin Ryle. Returning to Cambridge in 1946, Hewish completed his degree and immediately joined Ryle's research team at the Cavendish Laboratory, obtaining his PhD in 1952. Hewish made both practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the apparent scintillations of radio sources due to their radiation impinging upon plasma. This led him to propose, and secure funding for, the construction of the Interplanetary Scintillation Array, a large array radio telescope at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO), Cambridge to conduct a high time- resolution radio survey of interplanetary scintillation. ==Career and research== Hewish was professor of radio astronomy in the Cavendish Laboratory from 1971 to 1989 and head of the MRAO from 1982 to 1988. He developed an association with the Royal Institution in London when it was directed by Sir Lawrence Bragg. In 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Exploration of the Universe. He subsequently gave several Friday Evening Discourses and was made a Professor of the Royal Institution in 1977. but according to a search of the Royal Institution website he was Professor of Astronomy during 1976\u20131981 Hewish is a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. He is also a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. ===Awards and honours=== Hewish has Honorary degrees from six universities including Manchester, Exeter and Cambridge, is a Foreign Member of the Belgian Royal Academy and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. Other awards and honours include: * Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1968 * Eddington Medal, Royal Astronomical Society (1969) * Dellinger Gold Medal, International Union of Radio Science (1972) * Albert A. Michelson Medal, Franklin Institute (1973, jointly with Jocelyn Bell Burnell) * Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize (1974) * Nobel Prize for Physics (jointly) (1974) * Hughes Medal, Royal Society (1977) * Elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1998 ===Nobel Prize=== One of his PhD students, Jocelyn Bell (later known as Jocelyn Bell Burnell), discovered a radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first pulsar. The paper announcing the discovery had five authors, Hewish's name being listed first, Bell's second. Hewish and Martin Ryle were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974 for work on the development of radio aperture synthesis and its role in the discovery of pulsars. The exclusion of Bell from the Nobel prize was controversial and condemned by Hewish's fellow astronomer Fred Hoyle. See Nobel prize controversies. ==Personal life== Hewish married Marjorie Elizabeth Catherine Richards in 1950. They have a son, a physicist, and a daughter, a language teacher. ===Religious views=== Hewish has argued that religion and science are complementary. In the foreword to Questions of Truth Hewish writes, \"The ghostly presence of virtual particles defies rational common sense and is non-intuitive for those unacquainted with physics. Religious belief in God, and Christian belief ... may seem strange to common-sense thinking. But when the most elementary physical things behave in this way, we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense understanding.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Interviewed by Alan Macfarlane 26th March 2008 (video) * including the Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1974 Pulsars and High Density Physics Category:Living people Category:1924 births Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:English astronomers Category:British Nobel laureates Category:Fellows of Churchill College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:People from Fowey Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category:English Christians Category:People educated at King's College, Taunton Category:People from Taunton Category:English Nobel laureates Category:Spectroscopists Category:Radio astronomers ",
