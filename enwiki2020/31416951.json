He is also notable for commissioning two major works by Jean Fouquet - the Melun Diptych (which he gave to the Coll\u00e9giale Notre-Dame de Melun) and the Hours of \u00c9tienne Chevalier (in which he is shown twice praying before the Virgin, to whom he is presented by his patron saint Stephen). ==Life== The son of a secretary to Charles VII, he was twice sent to England with Guillaume Cousinot de Montreuil before becoming secretary to the king, then conseiller and ma\u00eetre des comptes, contr\u00f4leur de la recette g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances and finally treasurer of France (1452). Chevalier, Jacques C\u0153ur and the doctor Robert Poitevin were made executors of the king's favourite Agn\u00e8s Sorel, probably the model for the Virgin Mary in the second panel of the Melun Diptych. ==Sources== * Pierre Cl\u00e9ment, Jacques C\u0153ur et Charles VII, ou La France au XVe si\u00e8cle, Guillaumin, Paris, 1853, pp. 76\u201377 . * Press dossier for the exhibition L'enluminure en France au temps de Jean Fouquet, 26 March - 22 June 2003, mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly .
