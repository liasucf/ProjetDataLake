She won a silver medal in the 200 m breaststroke at the 1931 European Championships, behind Cecelia Wolstenholme. Next year she set four world records in the 400 m and 500 m breastroke (unofficial events), but could not compete in the Olympics due to the overall financial problems related to the Great Depression. She won the national titles in the 200 m in 1933, 1935 and 1936, yet her performance declined, and at the 1936 Summer Olympics she finished in a mere seventh place. In 1942, Kastein married Evert Heleonardus Scheijde, a physician; they had two sons. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Dutch female swimmers Category:Female breaststroke swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of the Netherlands Category:Swimmers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers from Amsterdam Category:European Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming ",
