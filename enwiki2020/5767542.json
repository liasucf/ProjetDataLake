U-Y had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine- cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-Y was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a Flak M42 as well as two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of forty-eight. ===Armament=== ====FLAK weaponry==== U-889 was mounted with the rare Twin 3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U on the DLM42 mount. This was one of the best AA weapons used by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The DLM42 mount was mainly used on the Type IX as it was rather heavy for the Type VII U-boats. The 3.7 cm Flak M42U was the marine version of the 3.7 cm Flak used by the Kriegsmarine on Type VII and Type IX U-boats.

The FuMB 26 Tunis combined the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted in either the Direction Finder Antenna Loop and separately on the bridge.

Until 14 March 1945 she was attached to 4th U-boat Flotilla for training. She was then assigned to 33rd U-boat Flotilla, a combat unit based at Flensburg. Her first, and only, active patrol started on 15 March 1945. She sank no vessels before the war ended and subsequently surrendered to a Canadian patrol. ==Surrender== After the German surrender on 8 May 1945, the German High Command ordered all U-boats to surrender. On the afternoon of 10 May, U-889 was spotted south of Newfoundland by a RCAF airplane, steaming at 10 knots and flying a black flag of surrender. The RCAF plane radioed to nearby Western Escort Force W-6 who intercepted the submarine an hour later. U-889 was ordered to head to Bay Bulls, Newfoundland. 24 hours later U-889 was turned over to the frigates and who escorted her to Shelburne Harbour where she was boarded and Braeucker, her commanding officer, made a formal surrender. On 14 May 1945, U-889 was commissioned into the RCN and decommissioned in December 1945. U-889 was one of ten U-boats allocated to the United States as part of the Tripartite Naval Commission sitting in Berlin in November 1945. She sailed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 11 January 1946 and experiments were conducted on her special hydrophone gear. She was scuttled at the end of 1947. ==See also== * - also captured and commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy * Military history of Nova Scotia ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * Brief History of HMCS ROCKCLIFFE ==External links== * Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in Bremen (state) Category:German Type IX submarines Category:U-boats commissioned in 1944 Category:U-boats sunk in 1947 Category:Maritime incidents in 1947 Category:1944 ships Category:World War II submarines of Germany Category:Submarines of the Royal Canadian Navy ",
