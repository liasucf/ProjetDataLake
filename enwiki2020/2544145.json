The electoral division in which the village sits has a sparsely distributed population of about 450 people. Adrigole is a scattered village strung approximately 9 km along the north-western shore of Bantry Bay on the scenic south coast of the Beara Peninsula. Looming over it is Hungry Hill (687m, 2,253 ft) with two rock-girt lakes which feed a cascade. Hungry Hill is the highest of the Caha range which forms the spine of the peninsula, and gave its name to Daphne du Maurier's novel about the local copper-mining barons of the 19th century. There is also Adrigole Mountain and the Healy Pass (334m) nearby. == Amenities and economy == The main industries in the area are fishing, farming, and tourism.
