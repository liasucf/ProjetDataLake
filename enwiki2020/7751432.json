    "text": "Empress Wang (\u738b\u7687\u540e, personal name unknown) (died 563), formally Empress Jing (\u975c\u7687\u540e, literally \"the meek empress\"), was an empress of the Chinese dynasty Western Liang. Her husband Emperor Xuan of Western Liang (Xiao Cha) founded the Western Liang with the support of Western Wei. It is not known when she married Xiao Cha, but it is known that she was his wife, not his concubine, and that while he carried the title Prince of Yueyang, she was the Princess of Yueyang. It is not known whether she was the mother of any of Xiao Cha's five known sons, although she was not the mother of his eventual heir Xiao Kui, whose mother was Xiao Cha's concubine Consort Cao. In 549, when the Liang dynasty was in a state of disarray after the capital Jiankang had fallen to the rebel general Hou Jing, Xiao Cha, then with his headquarters at Xiangyang (\u8944\u967d, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), feared an attack from his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, and therefore became a Western Wei vassal. In order to show his loyalty, he sent Princess Wang and his heir apparent Xiao Liao (\u856d\u5d9a) to Western Wei as hostages. At some point, Western Wei allowed her to return to Xiao Cha. In 555, after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed Xiao Yi, Western Wei created Xiao Cha the emperor of (Western) Liang (as Emperor Xuan). He created Princess Wang empress. In 562, after Emperor Xuan died and was succeeded by Xiao Kui (who had been created crown prince because Xiao Liao died before Emperor Xuan's ascension) as Emperor Ming, Emperor Ming honored her as empress dowager. She died in 563. ==Footnotes== |- Neither Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Ming nor grandson Emperor Jing was recorded in history as having created an empress, although it was possible that either or both did Wang, Empress Xuan Category:563 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
