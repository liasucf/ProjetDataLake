The film is set in and around the small city of Fenyang, Shanxi province, China (Jia's birthplace), from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1990s. It follows a group of twenty-something performers as they face personal and societal changes. The dialogue is a mixture of local speech, mainly Jin Chinese and Mandarin. The film has been called \"an epic of grassroots\". It is named after a popular song about waiting at a railway platform. Platform has garnered wide acclaim from critics in the years since its release, and is often named one of the greatest films of the 2000s. ==Plot== The film starts in 1979 in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. A theatre troupe of young adults in Fenyang performs state-approved material. The troupe includes Cui Minliang and his friends, Yin Ruijuan, Zhang Jun, and Zhong Ping. Zhang and Zhong are together. Cui asks Yin if she is his girlfriend, but she replies that she is not. The troupe leaves their hometown and travels throughout the country for several years during the 1980s. Yin stays behind in Fenyang and becomes a tax collector. The authorities find out about the illegal sexual relationship between Zhang and Zhong, and Zhong then leaves the group, never to return. As China undergoes massive social changes, the troupe alters their performances and starts to play rock music. They eventually return to Fenyang. Cui, jaded by his years on the road, reunites with Yin. ==Cast== * Wang Hongwei \u2013 Cui Minliang * Zhao Tao \u2013 Yin Ruijuan * Liang Jingdong \u2013 Zhang Jun * Yang Tianyi \u2013 Zhong Ping * Wang Bo \u2013 Yao Eryong * Han Sanming \u2013 Sanming ==Critical reception== Platform was voted the second best film of the past decade by the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF)'s Cinematheque, by more than 60 film experts (historians, archivists, etc.) from around the world.TIFF Cinematheque's Best of the Decade \"Thai film tops TIFF list of decade's best\" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
