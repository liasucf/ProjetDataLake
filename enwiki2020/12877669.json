Two days later the ship was transferred to the Coast Guard for operation before being permanently transferred on 11 March 1946. Renamed Kukui and designated WAK-186 the ship was the largest in the Coast Guard with notable service installing, servicing and supplying the Loran-A and Loran-C electronic navigation chain stations in the Pacific until March 1972. The ship was transferred to the Philippines to serve as the Philippine Navy's supply ship BRP Mactan (TK90) until June 2001. ==Construction== Colquitt was launched 21 January 1945, by Froemming Brothers, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2147; sponsored by Mrs. Fred Zillman. ==US Navy service== The ship was transferred to the Navy 17 August 1945 and commissioned USS Colquitt, designated AK-174, on 22 September 1945 with Lieutenant Commander F. E. Miner, USCG, in command. Two days later the ship was transferred to the US Coast Guard for operation with permanent transfer on 11 March 1946. In the very brief Navy service the ship was one of the . ==Coast Guard history== On permanent transfer the ship was renamed and reclassified Kukui (WAK-186) as the needed large cargo vessel to supply the equipment and personnel for the construction and logistical support of the Pacific Loran-A and Loran-C systems. Her name was changed to Kukui, a name taken from a buoy tender that had just been decommissioned, and was given the designation WAK-186. She was converted to Coast Guard specifications at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. During her Coast Guard career she was based out of Honolulu, Hawaii. Construction, major maintenance and supply of the systems was done by sailors of Kukui. Their dual role as seamen and construction workers was one of the most unique assignments in the armed forces. She carried on her decks two LCMs to ferry men and equipment to shore and also had three bulldozers, several trucks and a few jeeps stashed in her holds. Seven months a year she was underway providing necessary logistic support to members of the Coast Guard LORAN chain throughout the western Pacific. During this time she delivered \"everything from toothpicks to antenna poles; from a can of pepper to a Quonset hut.\" She also carried the complex electronic equipment necessary to set up the LORAN system. As a Coast Guard public affairs release noted: \"The men and officers of the black-hulled cutter were a versatile group. They not only sailed the ship but they operated bulldozers, landing craft, trucks and jeeps.\" A typical voyage would cover over and Kukui would deliver of cargo to the many Coast Guard operated LORAN stations throughout the western Pacific. In all she would make over 20 stops at various stations and ports, including Yokosuka, Japan and Manila Harbor in the Republic of the Philippines. On 15 June 1953 she rendered medical assistance to a civilian workman injured at Batan LORAN station. In 1957 the crew of the Kukui observed a lack of books in the Philippine school districts they visited. The following year they got up a collection of 400 books to give to needy schoolchildren. Through hard work and perseverance they increased the total to 45,000 books within the next three years. She also delivered relief supplies to the island of Batan after it was hit by Typhoon Elaine. On 1 December 1969, French Frigate Shoals LORAN Station was hit by a tidal wave, forcing the crew to evacuate and destroying much of the station. Kukui was sent to the island the following month and was responsible for her reconstruction and rehabilitation. On 24 June 1970 she collided with the M/V Myoriki Maru No. 25 six miles from Yokosuka, Japan, with both vessels receiving minor damage. In January 1972, the Kukui received word that as part of a move to reduce Coast Guard spending, she would be decommissioned. She later received word that upon her decommissioning in Honolulu on 1 March 1972, she would be turned over to the Navy who in turn would give her to the Philippine Navy. ==Philippine Navy history== Kukui was transferred to the Republic of the Philippines, renamed BRP Mactan (TK90), and reclassified a supply ship. She was removed from the Philippines Navy 7 June 2001. ==Awards and decorations== Her crew members were eligible for the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * National Defense Service Medal == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * * ==External links== * Category:Alamosa-class cargo ships Category:Ships built in Milwaukee Category:1945 ships Category:Ships of the United States Coast Guard Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Georgia-related ships Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Philippine Navy ",
