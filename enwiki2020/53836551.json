    "text": "Age-related mobility disability is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, dexterity or stamina.Ward, Rachel E. et al. \u201cSensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.\u201d Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273\u20132279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017. It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.Guralnik, Jack M., et al. \"Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery.\" The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231. ==History== According to the National Research Council, the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the baby boomer generation; this will increase the population of mobility disabled individuals in the community.Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996. This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility, in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. \"The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender.\" Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148. The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilities are not restricted to older and hospitalized individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non- hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. \u201cMobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.\u201d Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235\u2013243.

Guralnik. \"Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk.\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. \"The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons.\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. \u201cStopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.\u201d Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260\u2013265.

PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017. Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of mobility aid devices such as mobility scooter, wheelchair, crutches or a walker which will eventually help in the community ambulation. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is \u201cperformance based mobility disability\u201d.Goldman, Noreen et al. \u201cPerformance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self- Reports.\u201d Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227\u2013252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017. It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4 m/s.Tinetti, Mary E., et al. \"Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes.\" Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. \"Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability.\" The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. \u201cThe Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.\u201d The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319\u20131323. Print. If an individual is unable to walk at >0.4 m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a mobility device to walk in community. ==Risk factors== There are number of factors that could be associated with mobility disability, but according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cstroke is found to be the leading cause of mobility disability, in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the stroke survivors above 65 years of age\u201d.Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. \"Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association.\" Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447. ==Measures== There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, self-reported measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and validity. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,Ettinger, Walter H., et al. \"Self\u2010Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study.\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. \u201cAssociation of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.\u201d Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721\u2013725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. \u201cDisabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?\u201d Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766\u2013773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne\u2010maree, et al. \"Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty\u2010five.\" Arthritis Care & Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. \"Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over.\" Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539. but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.Gill, Thomas M., et al. \"The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons.\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254. ===Self-reported measures=== Several qualitative research studies use survey (human research), questionnaires and self-reported scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future mobility disability in older adults.Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. \u201cUse of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.\u201d Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416\u2013434. Print. The advantages of these qualitative research scales are easier data acquisition and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in perception of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of chronic conditions and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still self-reported measures have been used extensively in behavioral and correlation studies.Baranowski, Tom. \"Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information- processing perspective.\" Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327. The commonly used self-reported measures to detect mobility disability are Stroke Impact scale, Rosow- Breslau scale, Barthel index, Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale. Based on reliability and validity of these scales, Stroke Impact scale has proven to have excellent test-retest reliability and construct validity, however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, Rosow- Breslau scale, Barthel Index and Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale proved important to predict future mobility disability based on the activities involved in these questionnaire scales. ===Performance-based measures=== Mobility disabilities due to age-related musculoskeletal pain or increase in chronic conditions are easier to detect by performance measures. Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, 5-minute walk test , walking speed, short physical performance battery test. Among these measures, 400-meter walk test and short physical performance battery test has been proven to be strong predictors of mobility disability in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent correlation between these two tests.Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. \u201cUse of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.\u201d The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223\u2013229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017. Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict mobility disability, self-reported measures such as Barthel index, and performance measures such as 400 m walk test and short physical performance battery test are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Aptitude Category:Gerontology Category:Motor control Category:Motor skills Category:Physical exercise Category:Physical fitness ",
