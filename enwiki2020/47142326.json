Like many of MVS's Baja California stations, it was originally owned by Carlos Armando Madrazo Pintado's Sociedad Mexicana de Radio de Baja California. MVS quickly bought SOMER Baja California and later dissolved the concessionaire. As part of its 2017 concession renewal, on August 27, 2018, XHADA-FM moved to 104.1 MHz, in order to clear 106-108 MHz as much as possible for community and indigenous radio stations.Renewal of concession and frequency change ==References== Category:Radio stations in Ensenada, Baja California Category:Radio stations established in 1991 Category:MVS Radio ",
