    "text": "Glauke (minor planet designation: 288 Glauke) is a stony, tumbling asteroid and slow rotator from the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately 32 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 20 February 1890, by Robert Luther at D\u00fcsseldorf-Bilk Observatory in Germany. It was the last of his asteroid discoveries. It is named after Creusa (known as Glauce or Glauke), a daughter of Creon a king of Corinth in Greek mythology. == Description == Glauke has an exceptionally slow rotation period of about 1200 hours (50 days). This makes it one of the slowest-rotating asteroids in the Solar System. The rotation is believed to be \"tumbling\", similar to the near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis. It is a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification. == References == == External links == * * Category:Background asteroids Glauke Glauke Glauke Category:Slow rotating minor planets Category:S-type asteroids (Tholen) Category:S-type asteroids (SMASS) 18900220 ",
