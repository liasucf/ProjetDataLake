    "text": "In differential geometry, Santal\u00f3's formula describes how to integrate a function on the unit sphere bundle of a Riemannian manifold by first integrating along every geodesic separately and then over the space of all geodesics. It is a standard tool in integral geometry and has applications in isoperimetricCroke, Christopher B. \"A sharp four dimensional isoperimetric inequality.\" Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici 59.1 (1984): 187\u2013192. and rigidity results.Ilmavirta, Joonas, and Fran\u00e7ois Monard. \"4 Integral geometry on manifolds with boundary and applications.\" The Radon Transform: The First 100 Years and Beyond 22 (2019): 43. The formula is named after Luis Santal\u00f3, who first proved the result in 1952.Santal\u00f3, Luis Antonio.

Cambridge university press, 2004 == Formulation == Let (M,\\partial M,g) be a compact, oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary. Then for a function f: SM \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C} , Santal\u00f3's formula takes the form : \\int_{SM} f(x,v) \\, d\\mu(x,v) = \\int_{\\partial_+ SM} \\left[ \\int_0^{\\tau(x,v)} f(\\varphi_t(x,v)) \\, dt \\right] \\langle v, u(x) \\rangle \\, d \\sigma(x,v), where * (\\varphi_t)_t is the geodesic flow and \\tau(x,v) = \\sup\\\\{t\\ge 0: \\forall s\\in [0,t]:~ \\varphi_s(x,v)\\in SM \\\\} is the exit time of the geodesic with initial conditions (x,v)\\in SM , * \\mu and \\sigma are the Riemannian volume forms with respect to the Sasaki metric on SM and \\partial S M respectively ( \\mu is also called Liouville measure), * u is the inward-pointing unit normal to \\partial M and \\partial_+ SM := \\\\{(x,v) \\in SM: x \\in \\partial M, \\langle v, u(x) \\rangle \\ge 0 \\\\} the influx-boundary, which should be thought of as parametrization of the space of geodesics. == Validity == Under the assumptions that # M is non-trapping (i.e. \\tau(x,v) <\\infty for all (x,v)\\in SM ) and # \\partial M is strictly convex (i.e. the second fundamental form II_{\\partial M}(x) is positive definite for every x \\in \\partial M ), Santal\u00f3's formula is valid for all f\\in C^\\infty(M). In this case it is equivalent to the following identity of measures: : \\Phi^*d \\mu (x,v,t) = \\langle u(x),x\\rangle d \\sigma(x,v) d t, where \\Omega=\\\\{(x,v,t): (x,v)\\in \\partial_+SM, t\\in (0,\\tau(x,v)) \\\\} and \\Phi:\\Omega \\rightarrow SM is defined by \\Phi(x,v,t)=\\varphi_t(x,v). In particular this implies that the geodesic X-ray transform I f(x,v) = \\int_0^{\\tau(x,v)} f(\\varphi_t(x,v)) \\, dt extends to a bounded linear map I: L^1(SM, \\mu) \\rightarrow L^1(\\partial_+ SM, \\sigma_ u), where d\\sigma_ u(x,v) = \\langle v, u(x) \\rangle \\, d \\sigma(x,v) and thus there is the following, L^1-version of Santal\u00f3's formula: : \\int_{SM} f \\, d \\mu = \\int_{\\partial_+ SM} If ~ d \\sigma_ u \\quad \\text{for all } f \\in L^1(SM,\\mu). If the non-trapping or the convexity condition from above fail, then there is a set E\\subset SM of positive measure, such that the geodesics emerging from E either fail to hit the boundary of M or hit it non- transversely. In this case Santal\u00f3's formula only remains true for functions with support disjoint from this exceptional set E. == Proof == The following proof is taken from [,Guillarmou, Colin, Marco Mazzucchelli, and Leo Tzou. \"Boundary and lens rigidity for non-convex manifolds.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.10059 (2017). Lemma 3.3], adapted to the (simpler) setting when conditions 1) and 2) from above are true. Santal\u00f3's formula follows from the following two ingredients, noting that \\partial_0SM=\\\\{(x,v):\\langle u(x), v\\rangle =0 \\\\} has measure zero. * An integration by parts formula for the geodesic vector field X : : \\int_{SM} Xu ~ d \\mu = - \\int_{\\partial_+ SM} u ~ d \\sigma_ u \\quad \\text{for all } u \\in C^\\infty(SM) * The construction of a resolvent for the transport equation X u = - f: : \\exists R: C_c^\\infty( SM\\smallsetminus\\partial_0 SM) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(SM): XRf = - f \\text{ and } Rf\\vert_{\\partial_+ SM} = If \\quad \\text{for all } f\\in C_c^\\infty( SM\\smallsetminus\\partial_0 SM) For the integration by parts formula, recall that X leaves the Liouville-measure \\mu invariant and hence Xu = \\operatorname{div}_G (uX) , the divergence with respect to the Sasaki-metric G . The result thus follows from the divergence theorem and the observation that \\langle X(x,v), N(x,v)\\rangle_G = \\langle v, u(x)\\rangle_g , where N is the inward-pointing unit-normal to \\partial SM. The resolvent is explicitly given by Rf(x,v) = \\int_0^{\\tau(x,v)} f(\\varphi_t(x,v)) \\, dt and the mapping property C_c^\\infty( SM\\smallsetminus\\partial_0 SM) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(SM) follows from the smoothness of \\tau: SM\\smallsetminus\\partial_0 SM \\rightarrow [0,\\infty), which is a consequence of the non-trapping and the convexity assumption. == References == * Category:Differential geometry Category:Mathematical concepts Category:Integrals Category:Riemannian geometry ",
