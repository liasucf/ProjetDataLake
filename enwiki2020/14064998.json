    "text": "Abercorn Walk is an upscale shopping center that runs along Abercorn Street in midtown Savannah, Georgia. It is located near the city's more upscale midtown commercial sector. Abercorn Walk resembles a village in which each storefront retains a different style. Originally announced in 2003, Abercorn Walk was built atop a stretch of buildings that had been a church, a funeral home, a car lot and a house. The anchor store, which had been announced the previous year, was The Fresh Market. By the fall of 2004, several other tenants had joined the roster and signed letters of intent. As of 2016, major tenants besides The Fresh Market include Ann Taylor, White House Black Market, Francesca's Collection, Chico's, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Talbots, Williams Sonoma, and Ethan Allen. Abercorn Walk sits across the street from another upscale shopping center, Twelve Oaks du March\u00e9, which opened in 1984 and has a horseshoe shape. This center includes Publix, Cold Stone Creamery, Starbucks, Bonefish Grill, and Pier 1 Imports, among many others. Many locally owned boutiques like Globe Shoe Company have suburban branches at Twelve Oaks. It is built of imitation \"Savannah gray\" brick and has a copper patina roof. ==References== *http://edensandavant.com/oc_center_detail.asp?cid=963 *https://archive.is/20130203123953/http://old.savannahnow.com/stories/101304/2510450.shtml *https://archive.is/20130201175535/http://old.savannahnow.com/stories/061105/3093791.shtml *https://archive.is/20130201180914/http://old.savannahnow.com/stories/081505/3225634.shtml Category:Shopping malls established in 2005 Category:Shopping malls in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Buildings and structures in Savannah, Georgia Category:Tourist attractions in Savannah, Georgia Category:2005 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
