Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=714721 on 2020-10-04 ==Description== The shell attains a length of 74 mm. Volutes are predators that live in deep waters where they stalk and kill other molluscs. Volutes do not have a free-swimming larval stage. Their large egg capsules contain enough food to allow the embryos to develop over several months. What emerges from these capsules are tiny but fully formed shells. Volutes tend to spend their life in colonies and have small home ranges. ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off New Britain and Western Australia. ==References== == External links == * Sowerby, G.
