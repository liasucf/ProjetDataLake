Baba Voss, the chieftain of the Alkenny tribe, takes in and marries a woman, Maghra, who comes to the Alkenny seeking shelter. Baba Voss has been unable to father children, and the woman is pregnant when she first arrives. To both the woman and Baba Voss's surprise, the woman has twins who can see. The twins are named Kofun and Haniwa, and their biological father is Jerlamarel. As word spreads, it gets the attention of a cynical tribe and its queen who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the twins. The queen knows Jerlamarel had the ability to see and wants his children. Jerlamarel was also the queen's favored consort who ran away with Maghra. In order to protect the children, Voss is forced to rely on his instincts and must rally fellow tribes to take down the queen and her tyrannical cult before they can capture the children.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though its capable cast is clearly game, an over- reliance on gore and a grimly\u2014and at times comically\u2014convoluted narrative blurs Sees bold vision.\" On Metacritic the series has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Variety's Daniel D'Addario was critical of the show, saying it: \"Wastes the time of Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard, among others, on a story that starts from a position of fun, giddy strangeness and drags itself forward at a lugubrious pace.\" Ben Travers at IndieWire responded positively: \"Steven Knight's action-drama is a strange-but-effective blend\" and \"the balance isn\u2019t quite there yet, as episodes don\u2019t exactly earn their hourlong run time. Momoa, meanwhile, fits the role well.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Visual Effects Society Awards | rowspan=\"1\" |January 29, 2020 |Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Episode | Adrian de Wet, Eve Fizzinoglia, Matthew Welford, Pedro Sabrosa, Tom Blacklock | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==References== ==External links== * \u2013 official site * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2010s American science fiction television series Category:Dystopian television series Category:Dystopian web series Category:English-language television shows Category:Apple TV+ original programming Category:Television series set in the future Category:Television shows set in British Columbia Category:Television series produced in Vancouver Category:Post-apocalyptic television series Category:Post-apocalyptic web series Category:Television series created by Steven Knight Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic ",
