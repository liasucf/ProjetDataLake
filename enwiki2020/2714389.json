    "text": "Bridge of Sighs is the second solo album by the English guitarist and songwriter Robin Trower. Released in 1974, it was his second album after leaving Procol Harum, and was a commercial breakthrough for Trower. Songs such as \"Bridge of Sighs\", \"Too Rolling Stoned\", \"Day of the Eagle\" and \"Little Bit of Sympathy\" became live concert staples. ==History== The album was produced by organist Matthew Fisher, formerly Trower's bandmate in Procol Harum. Acclaimed Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick was this album's sound engineer. In an interview with Guitar World, Trower explained how the album got its title. Robin said that he had had the first line of the song for years and one day saw some sport pages which listed a racehorse called Bridge of Sighs, which he thought would be a great title. Bridge of Sighs (Chrysalis 1057) reached #7 in the United States during a chart stay of 31 weeks. It was certified Gold on 10 September 1974. Early printings of the original album cover had the front image upside-down and were more greenish in colour. The title track was covered by Opeth for the special edition of their 2008 album Watershed. A segment of it also appears as a hidden track on Metallica's 1998 cover album Garage Inc. \"Day of the Eagle\" was covered by Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens on his third solo album Memory Crash (2008). Tesla also covered the song on their 2007 Real to Reel album as did Armored Saint on their Nod to the Old School record. \"Too Rolling Stoned\" was covered by UFO on their 2004 covers album The Salentino Cuts. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Robin Trower; except where indicated ===Side one=== #\"Day of the Eagle\" - 4:59 #\"Bridge of Sighs\" - 5:05 #\"In This Place\" - 4:28 #\"The Fool and Me\" (James Dewar, Robin Trower) - 3:57 ===Side two=== #\"Too Rolling Stoned\" - 7:29 #\"About to Begin\" - 3:43 #\"Lady Love\" (Dewar, Trower) - 3:21 #\"Little Bit of Sympathy\" - 4:20 The album was remastered and remixed in 1999 with five bonus tracks recorded for KMET radio at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California: # * \"Day of the Eagle\" (recorded 29/5/74) - 3:48 #\"Bridge of Sighs\" (recorded 29/5/74) - 5:16 #\"Too Rolling Stoned\" (recorded 29/5/74) - 6:26 #\"Lady Love\" (recorded 29/5/74) - 3:12 #\"Little Bit of Sympathy\" (recorded 29/5/74) - 4:49 The album was remastered once again and released in 2007 with eight bonus tracks from BBC Radio 1's \"John Peel Sessions\": # * \"Bridge of Sighs\" (recorded 5/3/74) - 4:54 #\"In This Place\" (recorded 5/3/74) - 4:04 #\"Alethea\" (recorded 5/3/74) - 3:55 #\"Little Bit of Sympathy\" (recorded 5/3/74) - 3:52 #\"Fine Day\" (recorded 28/1/75) - 3:22 #\"Confessin\u2019 Midnight\" (recorded 28/1/75) - 4:47 #\"It's Only Money\" (recorded 28/1/75) - 5:01 #\"Gonna Be More Suspicious\" (recorded 28/1/75) - 2:58 ==Personnel== *Robin Trower \u2013 guitar *James Dewar \u2013 bass, vocals *Reg Isidore \u2013 drums === Additional Personnel === * Matthew Fisher \u2013 producer *Geoff Emerick \u2013 sound engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|41 |- |United States (Billboard 200) |align=\"center\"|7 |} ==References== == External links == * Robin Trower - Bridge of Sighs (1974) album releases & credits at Discogs * Robin Trower - Bridge of Sighs (1974, Remaster 2007) album to be listened on Spotify * Robin Trower - Bridge of Sighs (1974, Remaster 2007) album to be listened on YouTube Category:1974 albums Category:Robin Trower albums Category:albums produced by Matthew Fisher Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Chrysalis Records albums ",
