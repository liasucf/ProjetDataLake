Although the Aja are ethnically Kresh, their language is unintelligible to other Kresh languages. It is largely Banda in vocabulary, though it remains Kresh in structure. Most members of the tribe are bilingual in Kresh. Alternate spellings are Adja and Ajja. ==References== Category:Central Sudanic languages Category:Languages of South Sudan Category:Languages of the Central African Republic Category:Kresh languages ",
