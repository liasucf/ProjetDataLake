It has sold more than 500,000 physical copies and 3,000,000 digital copies in Japan. == Music video == On February 26, 2018, the music video was published on YouTube.

The temporary title was \"Memento.\" He said, \"I think it came from somewhere in my memory, but I can't really explain it well either.\" Even when the day before recording, he was still writing the lyrics, the last two sentences \"Like one half of a fruit sliced in two, even now, you are my light\" suddenly appears in his brain and he said, \"Ahh, so this song really was \"Lemon.\"\" He also did the cover illustration himself. He focused on liveliness and freshness of a lemon, giving it an image quite unlike what's typically associated with death. For the song, he wanted to go for a ballad, but a simple ballad is not very interesting for him, and he did not want it to be purely gloomy. As a result, he made a hybrid of sorts, with sad words over a dancing, skipping rhythm. He made this song while on his nationwide tour, during which his grandfather passed away. He agonized over it a lot, so it took even longer to finish than usual. == Track listing == == Charts == === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Hot 100) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Oricon) | 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Oricon Combined) | 1 |} === Year-end charts === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Hot 100) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Oricon) | 18 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Hot 100) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Oricon) |34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Oricon Combined) |10 |} == Certifications == ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
