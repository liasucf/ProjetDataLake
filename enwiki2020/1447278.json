    "text": "Obertruppf\u00fchrer (, \"senior troop leader\") was a paramilitary rank of the Nazi Party that was used between the years of 1932 and 1945. The rank is most closely associated with the Sturmabteilung (SA), but also was an early rank of the Schutzstaffel (SS) in that group\u2019s formative years. Translated as \u201cSenior Troop Leader\u201d, Obertruppf\u00fchrer traces its origins to the rank of Truppf\u00fchrer which was a title used by Stormtrooper Companies (Shock Troops) during the First World War. As an SA rank, Obertruppf\u00fchrer was created in 1932 due to the SA\u2019s expansion and growing membership. The rank of Obertruppf\u00fchrer was junior to Haupttruppf\u00fchrer and typically served as a senior non-commissioned officer rank equivalent to a Platoon Sergeant in other military organizations. As an SS rank, Obertruppf\u00fchrer was used by the SS between the years of 1932 and 1934. An SS-Obertruppf\u00fchrer carried similar duties to their SA counterparts and the rank was also used in the very early days of the SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe (SS-VT). Obertruppf\u00fchrer was abolished as an SS rank after the Night of the Long Knives (1934), when the rank was renamed as SS-Hauptscharf\u00fchrer. Obertruppf\u00fchrer survived as a rank of the SA until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945. The insignia for Obertruppf\u00fchrer consisted of two button pips and a silver stripe centered on a collar patch. {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\" |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior Rank Truppf\u00fchrer |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|SA rank Obertruppf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior Rank Haupttruppf\u00fchrer |} ==Insignia== NSFK-Obertruppf\u00fchrer.svg|NSFK NSKK- Obertruppf\u00fchrer.svg|NSKK OT-Obertruppf\u00fchrer.svg|OT RAD-Obertruppf\u00fchrer.svg|RAD RBL-Luftschutzobertruppmeister.svg|RBL SA-Obertruppf\u00fchrer.svg|SA == Notes == == Bibliography == * * Category:Nazi paramilitary ranks ",
