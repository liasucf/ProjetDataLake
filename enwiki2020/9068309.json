Maneuver and Firepower: The Evolution of Divisions and Separate Brigades Government Printing Office, 1 January 1999 It assumed the mission of the tank battalion of the 5th Infantry Division previously there. The next change occurred in the mid-1960s amid Army-wide reductions to make resources available for the Vietnam War. In a personnel-saving action, the Combat Developments Command's 194th Armored Brigade at Fort Ord was replaced by a battalion-size combat team and reorganized at Fort Knox to support the Armor School in place of the 16th Armored Group. Under the new configuration, the brigade included one mechanized infantry and two armored battalions. The brigade was cannibalized to fill out CONUS-based III Corps units deploying to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. == Historical composition == David Isby & Charles Kamps, Jr., record the composition of the 194th Armored Brigade (Separate) in 1984 in Armies of NATO\u2019s Central Front as including: *4th Battalion, 54th Infantry *5th Battalion, 73d Armor *5th Battalion, 33d Armor *5th Battalion, 41st Field Artillery *D Troop, 10th Cavalry *522d Engineer Company *3rd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery There were the following units assigned to the 194th Armored Brigade (Separate) in 1990.Unit Assignments under the U.S. Army Regimental System in 1990 They were: *HHC, 194th Armored Brigade *1st Battalion, 10th Cavalry *2d Battalion, 10th Cavalry *2d Battalion, 33rd Armor *D Troop, 10th Cavalry *4th Battalion, 15th Infantry *19th Engineer Battalion *75th Support Battalion *1st Battalion, 77th Field Artillery *MP Platoon *517th Military Intelligence Detachment The brigade downsized to primarily the 19th Engineer Battalion and Task Force 1st Battalion, 10th Cavalry. The task force consisted of a headquarters company that included Cav Scouts (hmmv and silenced motorcycle) medics and indirect fire infantry (mechanized mortars/M106), three armored (M-1 Abrams,A-2, then A-3) companies, two infantry companies (mechanized) and one field artillery battery (M109 SP 155mm - Battery A, 77th Field Artillery) and a squadron of Apaches. The brigade was reduced to a separate battalion task force in 1993, the 2d Battalion, 33d Armor, of which at least three companies were tank and one was mechanized infantry, with sources also mentioning artillery and Bradley M-3 scout companies.Blog posting by former 194th Bde (2\u201333 AR) crews 2\u201333 AR Task Force was finally disbanded in mid-late 1994. == Current configuration == The 194th Armored Brigade designation has been restored to active duty.
