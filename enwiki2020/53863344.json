    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Demonstration tournament was played from 14 to 20 October 1968 at three venues in Guadalajara, Mexico: Guadalajara Country Club, Atlas Sports Club and Guadalajara Sports Club; all of them featured clay courts. All matches were played at best-of-five sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Americans Julie Heldman and Herb Fitzgibbon won the tournament by defeating West Germans Helga Niessen and J\u00fcrgen Fassbender 6\u20131, 6\u20133 in the final. Peaches Bartkowicz and Jim Osborne, also Americans, won the third place. ==Seeds== The top two seeds received a bye into quarterfinals. ==Draw== Bronze Medal Match ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Demonstration ",
