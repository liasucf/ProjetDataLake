    "text": "Westlock-Sturgeon was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using first-past-the-post balloting from 1986 to 1993. ==History== ===Boundary history=== {|class=wikitable align=right !colspan=5|Members of the Legislative Assembly |- !Assembly !Years !colspan=2|Member !Party |- |colspan=5 align=center|See Athabasca 1905-1986, Redwater-Andrew 1971-1986, and St. Albert 1905-1986. |- |21st |1986-1989 |rowspan=2 | |rowspan=2|Nicholas Taylor |rowspan=2|Liberal |- |22nd |1989-1993 |- |colspan=5 align=center|See Barrhead-Westlock 1993-2004, Redwater 1993-2004, and Spruce Grove-Sturgeon-St. Albert 1993-2012 |} The riding was created for the 1986 election from parts of three ridings: the town of Westlock was transferred from Athabasca, while the part of Sturgeon County around Morinville was transferred from St. Albert, along with a small part of Redwater-Andrew. The riding was abolished only seven years later at the next redistribution. The northern half of the riding was transferred to Barrhead-Westlock, with Morinville and the area east of it going to Redwater and the remainder to Spruce Grove-Sturgeon-St. Albert. ===Representation history=== The riding's only MLA was Nicholas Taylor, who had led the Liberal Party through its decade-long drought. His election in 1986, along with three other Liberals in Edmonton and Calgary, was a breakthrough for the party. He was replaced by Laurence Decore as party leader only two years later, but was re-elected in Westlock-Sturgeon in 1989. For the second term in a row, Taylor was the only Liberal MLA in rural Alberta. When the riding was abolished in 1993, he went on to serve as MLA for Redwater. ==Election results== ===1986 general election=== ===1989 general election=== ==Also see== *Alberta provincial electoral districts ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Elections Alberta *The Legislative Assembly of Alberta Category:Former Alberta provincial electoral districts ",
