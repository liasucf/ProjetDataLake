    "text": "The Andean Wolf (Dasycyon hagenbecki) is a purported canine that is falsely labelled a wolf. In 1927, Lorenz Hagenbeck bought one of three pelts from a dealer in Buenos Aires who claimed that they had come from a wild dog of the Andes. The German mammalogist Ingo Krumbiegel published two papers describing the animal and giving it the scientific name of Dasycyon hagenbecki.Krumbiegel, I. von. 1949. Der Andenwolf-ein neuentdecktes Grosstier. Unschau Wiss. Tech., vol. 19, pp. 590-591.Krumbiegel, I. von. 1953. Der \"Andenwolf', Dasycyon hagenbecki (Krumbeigel, 1949). Saugetierk. Mitt., vol. 1, pp. 97-104. The American zoologist Howard J. Stains supported Krumbeigel's new genus Dasycyon.Stains, Howard J. 1967. Carnivores and pinnipeds. In S. Anderson and J. K. Jones (eds.), Recent mammals of the world, a synopsis of families. New York, The Ronald Press Co., pp. 325-354.Stains, Howard J. 1975. Distribution and taxonomy of the Canidae. In M. W. Fox (ed.), The wild canids, their systematics, behavioral ecology and evolution. New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., pp. 3-26 Other mammalogists believe that the skin was that of a domestic dog. ==References== Category:Wolves ",
