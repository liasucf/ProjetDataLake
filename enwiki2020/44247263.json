    "text": "The 2014\u201315 Wichita B-52s season was the second season of the Wichita B-52s professional indoor soccer club. The Wichita B-52s, a Central Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games at Hartman Arena in Park City, a suburb of Wichita, Kansas. The team was led by team president Joseph Pindell and head coach Kim Roentved. The B-52s finished the season with a 10\u201310 record, placing them 4th in the Central and out of the MASL playoffs. ==Season summary== Wichita struggled at the start of the season, losing on the road to the Dallas Sidekicks then defeating the Tulsa Revolution at home before losing their next 3 games. The B-52s began to find their footing with wins over Tulsa and the Chicago Mustangs then losses to the Missouri Comets and Oxford City FC of Texas. A 5-game win streak started with back-to-back road wins over the Seattle Impact and 3 wins over the St. Louis Ambush on 3 consecutive Saturday nights. Wichita lost 4 more games before home-and-road wins over Tulsa to complete the season. They team finished with a 10-10 record, earning fourth place in the Central Division but not qualifying for post-season play. ==History== B-52s defending against the Dallas Sidekicks. B-52s in action at Hartman Arena. The B-52s franchise fills a gap left when the second Wichita Wings, a franchise of the third Major Indoor Soccer League, folded in 2013. The B-52s' team colors are based on the Wings' team colors. In their inaugural season, the B-52 struggled through their first 4 games, beating only the Illinois Piasa and giving up 43 goals with Nic Martinez as keeper. Jason Dewey was brought in as the new primary goalkeeper, improving the winning percentage and sharply decreasing the number of goals surrendered per game. Wichita earned a 7\u20139 record but did not qualify for the Ron Newman Cup playoffs. The team performed better at the box office, drawing an average of 1,650 fans per game, placing them 6th in the 20-team league for average attendance. ==Off-field moves== In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. The 2014\u201315 MASL season will be 20 games long, 4 more than the 16 regular season games of recent PASL seasons. With the league expansion and reorganization, the B-52s' Central division rivals for 2014\u201315 are the Chicago Mustangs, Milwaukee Wave, St. Louis Ambush, Tulsa Revolution, and Kansas City-based Missouri Comets. After an inaugural season where the team lost more games than they won and failed to make the post-season, Wichita released Larry Inlow as head coach in September 2014. New head coach Jeff Kraft is a veteran player and coach with more than 20 years experience in indoor soccer. In late October, the team hired Kim Roentved as director of soccer operations, a job combining coaching, recruiting, and community outreach. Roentved has strong ties to Wichita, first as a player for the original Wichita Wings from 1980 to 1987 then as a player/coach from 1991 to 1998, with the last 4 of those years as head coach. He had most recently served as the head coach for the Missouri Comets of the now-defunct MISL. On November 26, with the B-52s earning only a 1\u20134 record after 5 games and struggling at the box office, the team released head coach Jeff Kraft and named his assistant coach, Darin Smith, to replace him on an interim basis. At the same time, the team released players Damian Garcia and Carlos \"Chile\" Farias, citing the need to \"rebuild\" and \"to keep moving forward\" as a team. On December 2, the team announced Kim Roentved as their new head coach. In late May 2015, local media reported that some players and staff had worked this season with little or no pay, some checks written by the team to vendors had bounced, and that the team owed Hartman Arena approximately $2,000. Team owner Joey Pindell told KWCH-DT that the \"B-52's are experiencing some struggles\" but that he was working with MASL officials to resolve their issues. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"220\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 26 | 5:05pm | Mexican National Indoor Team | L 4\u20139 | 0\u20131 | Hartman Arena | |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | November 1 | 7:00pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | L 6\u20137 | 0\u20131 | Allen Event Center | 3,768 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 8 | 7:05pm | Tulsa Revolution | W 12\u20136 | 1\u20131 | Hartman Arena | 1,510 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 3 | Sunday | November 16 | 3:05pm | Oxford City FC of Texas | L 9\u201310 (SO) | 1\u20132 | Hartman Arena | 885 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 4 | Saturday | November 22 | 7:05pm | at Missouri Comets | L 3\u201313 | 1\u20133 | Independence Events Center | 4,242 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 5 | Sunday | November 23 | 3:00pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 2\u20133 (OT) | 1\u20134 | Hartman Arena | 991 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 6 | Saturday | November 29 | 7:05pm | at Tulsa Revolution | W 8\u20134 | 2\u20134 | Cox Business Center | 461 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 7 | Saturday | December 6 | 7:05pm | Chicago Mustangs | W 8\u20135 | 3\u20134 | Hartman Arena | 1,539 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | December 13 | 7:05pm | at Missouri Comets | L 3\u201312 | 3\u20135 | Independence Events Center | 3,561 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 9 | Saturday | December 20 | 7:05pm | Oxford City FC of Texas | L 7\u20138 | 3\u20136 | Hartman Arena | 1,340 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 10 | Saturday | January 3 | 7:30pm | at Seattle Impact | W 12\u20134 | 4\u20136 | ShoWare Center | 723 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Sunday | January 4 | 4:00pm | at Seattle Impact | W 10\u20135 | 5\u20136 | ShoWare Center | 604 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 12 | Saturday | January 10 | 7:05pm | St. Louis Ambush | W 7\u20135 | 6\u20136 | Hartman Arena | 2,116 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 13 | Saturday | January 17 | 7:05pm | St. Louis Ambush | W 14\u20139 | 7\u20136 | Hartman Arena | 1,864 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 24 | 7:05pm | at St. Louis Ambush | W 9\u20138 (OT) | 8\u20136 | Family Arena | 6,027 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 25 | 3:05pm | at Milwaukee Wave | L 4\u201312 | 8\u20137 | UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena | 2,874 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 16 | Saturday | January 31 | 7:05pm | at Chicago Mustangs | L 5\u20138 | 8\u20138 | Sears Centre | 1,556 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 17 | Saturday | February 7 | 7:05pm | Milwaukee Wave | L 12\u201314 | 8\u20139 | Hartman Arena | 1,957 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 18 | Sunday | February 8 | 3:05pm | Missouri Comets | L 4\u201311 | 8\u201310 | Hartman Arena | 2,139 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 19 | Saturday | February 21 | 7:05pm | Tulsa Revolution | W 12\u20136 | 9\u201310 | Hartman Arena | 2,458 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 20 | Sunday | February 22 | 3:05pm | at Tulsa Revolution | W 22\u20134 | 10\u201310 | Expo Square Pavilion | 208 |} Game originally scheduled for Saturday, November 15.
