She came from the Kat\u014d clan and was the wife of the samurai warlord Okumura Nagatomi. She helped her family and the Maeda troops resist Sassa Narimasa at the Siege of Suemori Castle by providing food and medical aid to injured warriors and arming herself with a naginata to fight beside them during the conflict. == Siege of Suemori castle == Otsune patrols the inside of the castle with a naginata, cheers up the morale of castle soldiers, defend the castle walls from the attack of Narimasa troops consisting of 15,000 men and resisted until the arrival of the troops of Maeda Toshiie. Otsune's two eldest sons participated in the defense at a very young age.
