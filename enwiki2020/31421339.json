    "text": "Aviation pioneer Ladislao Pazmany (November 25, 1923 \u2013 August 21, 2006) was an aeronautical engineer, designer, builder, pilot, teacher, speaker and author. Ladislao Pazmany (November 25, 1923 - August 21, 2006) was an aviation pioneer, aeronautical engineer, designer, builder, pilot, teacher, speaker, and author. Born a Hungarian, Pazmany grew up, went to school and worked in his formative years in Argentina, then immigrated to the United States where he lived for the remainder of his life. His design engineering stretched from early model airplanes made of wood as a child in Argentina through six decades of work on gliders, small planes, jets, and missiles both for private purchase and for the largest defense contractors in America including Convair, General Dynamics and Rohr. Contributions to the unmanned stealth aircraft were utilized in action during the Iraq War in 2004. And for Ryan the Cloudster was his commercial contribution. With a passion for small personal aircraft he became recognized as a world authority on landing gear, light aircraft, and flight efficiencies through his books, plans and planes: The Pazmany PL-1 and PL-2,Jane\u2019s Encyclopedia of Aviation 1980. were used for training, the PL-4A, is a single seat VW powered, T-Tailed with folding wings; and the PL-9 Stork is a \u00be adaptation of the Luftwaffe STOL warbird. He was inducted into the Experimental Aircraft Association Hall of Fame in 1997 for his work in homebuilt aircraft. \"His work and reputation as an aeronautical engineer stretched across continents and touched people in every level of aviation, from government officials to young amateur pilots.\"EAA News \u201cAviation Pioneer Ladislao Pazmany Passes Away\u201d www.eaa.org == Ancestry == The Pazmanys, a Hungarian family of landed gentry with a rich cultural heritage, trace their ancestral roots back to the Middle Ages and to prominent Churchman Peter Pazmany, who codified the literary Hungarian language. \u201cPazmany, a Jesuit Cardinal and a master of Hungarian prose, was outstanding as an orator and essayist. His writing was characterized by a vigorous and clear, though far from simple, style, and the use of popular expressions and solid argument Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Com. Peter Pazmany Contribution to Hungarian Literature He led the Counter-Reformation in Hungary and is honored as national figure with the university he founded in Budapest, which is still a seat of higher learning today. == Childhood and early life == Ladislao's father Zoltan carried on the literary tradition as a journalist and contributing writer who spoke seven languages and, following the devastation of World War I moved his family of wife Maria Kacelli, and young sons Ladislao and Zoltan from the rural enclave of Zenta to the thriving metropolis of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital city, in 1926. In their new house in the Padilla district, the family prospered. Older son Ladislao made his first model plane at age five, followed by others, and was encouraged by his father to visit the airports and trains stations, developing an interest in trains, planes, motors and engines \u2013 leading to his first flying, in gliders at age 15. A prodigious student, the young Pazmany began teaching elementary aviation to adults while still a young man and later graduated with an honors degree from the prestigious Otto Krause Technical School in Buenos Aires. He continued four years of aeronautical engineering study at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata.Margarita Pazmany Interview: \u201cBiography\u201d Early Years March 2011 www.Pazmany.com Following his experience with gliders, Pazmany's first plane was a Piper Cub J-3 then a Cessna, becoming a pilot at only 15 years old. As the barnstorming spirit was very much alive with he and his like-minded friends Pazmany learned to fly over the cow pastures and farmlands outside of Buenos Aires, logging hours and integrating hundreds of air hours of practical flight experience into a growing knowledge of aeronautical engineering.Kitplanes September 1996 \u201cThe Chinese Connection\u201d By Shirley Hanson == Career == === Buenos Aires, Argentina === For nearly a decade he designed aircraft, pipelines, high tension power lines, suspension bridges, chemical and hydroelectric plants, and was an instructor (at Raggio Escuela Tecnica) an aeronautical school. He also worked as an auto company draftsman -sometimes holding as many as three jobs at the same time.Sport Aviation December 1997 Hall Of Fame Inductions\u201d, Ladislao PazmanySport Aviation October 1971 'Ladislao Pazmany Designer and Builder\u201d By Roy Gordon He also did work for The Air Force of Argentina (Fuerza Aerea Argentina), Techint Engineering, the international conglomerate, and finally, spent a year on the wing design of the Dewoitine 7-10, a twin engine light transport by the famous French designer who also produced in the same era, South America's first jet plane. After the end of World War II and a decade of political, social and economic unrest, the Peron regime ended and the many restrictions on professionals- including engineers, were lifted, allowing Ladislao Pazmany to pursue the unlimited possibilities of aeronautics in the United States, with its growing economy, expanding commercial aviation, and huge cold war contracts in the defense industry.Juan Domingo Peron : A History AuthoAlexander, Robert Jackson, Westview Press, 1979 === Immigration to the United States === In 1948 Ladislao Pazmany married Margarita Byro, a ballet dancer and an artist, also Hungarian with a similar ancestry, and with whom he had two young daughters when he arrived in San Diego, California in May 1956. With a house downtown just minutes from Lindbergh Field, Pazmany would make a home for his family, raise his children to maturity, become an American citizen, and years later have residence and office overlooking the airport and bay.Margarita Pazmany Interview: \u201cBiography\u201d Immigration March 2011 www.Pazmany.com == Career == === San Diego, California === \u201cIn 1953, the Soviets exploded a thermonuclear device and were supposedly working on ICBMs to carry uranium and hydrogen warheads. In reaction to this, in March 1954, the Western Development Division, a special missile command agency created by the Air Research and Development Command, awarded Convair its first long-term contract for engineering and fabrication of an ICBM.\u201d U.S.Centennial of Flight Commission www.centennialof flight.go The threat of Soviet supremacy in the nuclear age heightened Cold War tensions and spurred an expansion of spending, research and building in the defense industry that would continue unabated until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In addition to the strengthening of the American deterrent, great strides were made in aeronautics that spread and applied to all fields of aviation. Pazmany quickly earned a position at Convair which was a division of General Dynamics, and worked on the company's innovative Delta wing designed jets \u2013 the F-102 Delta Dagger an interceptor plane which was known as the \u201cDeuce\u201d and was used in Vietnam, and the more advanced F-106 Delta Dart a supersonic jet technology which prevailed well into the 1980s. During this period of some 25 years, starting with Convair, and General Dynamics Pazmany also worked at McDonnell Douglas for aerostructures and engines. Douglas was a specialist in fighter aircraft who merged with Boeing in 1967. At Rohr he produced related components, including engine nacelles, thrust reversers, and mounting pylons for both military and commercial aircraft. Pazmany's engineering talents stretched from conventional prop-driven aircraft to jets, missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned stealth craft, aero systems and parts. He earned seven patents for inventions for aircraft thrust reversers to emergency natural gas shut-off valves that activate during earthquakes. He researched, analyzed and wrote the NASA contractor report: \u201cPotential Structural Material and Design Concept For Light Airplanes\u201d NASA CR93258\" 1968, for mission analysis division. National Aeronautics Space Administration. Ames Research Center Moffett Field, California.Rohr, Inc: Private Company Information - BusinessWeek Pazmany then joined the legendary Claude Ryan (Lindbergh's Spirit Of St. Louis is credited to Ryan) and his son in developing the Ryson ST-100 Cloudster, a tandem two seat motor glider that was intended for cross country flight and as the latest contribution to Ryan's pioneering tradition in the San Diego aviation industry. \u201cThe Cloudster is a powered sailplane or an airplane that soars, whichever you prefer. As a touring airplane, it cruises at 135 mph (75-percentpower) using just 6 gph to yield a range of 690 miles. At lower power settings, the range can be greatly increased. Only 20-percent power is required to keep the Cloudster in level flight.\u201dPlane and Pilot February 10. 2009 Ryson ST-100 Cloudster ===University teaching=== From his this defense work Pazmany introduced new concepts, innovations, principles and practices as a lecturer at both UCSD, the University of California at San Diego, 1979\u20131980; and SDSU, San Diego State University, 1975\u20131979. Subjects ranged widely from light aircraft design, engineering, and construction to larger, jet, missile, and space applications.Sport Aviation December 1997 Hall Of Fame Inductions, Ladislao Pazmany ===Experimental Aircraft Association === After only one month of arriving in the United States and getting his start at Convair a dedicated Ladislao Pazmany attended his first EAA meeting \u2013 the new, Experimental Aircraft Association that had just been founded shortly before in January 1953, at Curtis-Wright Field in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Led by Paul Poberezny and a small group of aviation enthusiasts who promoted sport aviation, these pilots quickly expanded their mission to include antiques, classics, warbirds, aerobatic aircraft, ultra-lights, helicopters, and contemporary manufactured aircraft. The EAA embodied the spirit of the Wright Brothers and a commitment to personal aviation.History, The EAA. www.eaa.org ===Planes === ===Pazmany PL-1=== The EAA chapter in San Diego began a group design project that evolved into Pazmany's own unique vision of a two-seat, side-by-side, low-wing, tri- cycled gear airplane that was stressed for aerobatics with a plus 9 and minus 4 1/2G ultimate load factor at full gross weight and that carried all its fuel in two 13 gallon fiberglass wing tip tanks.\u201cP\u201d for Pazmany, \u201cL\u201d for Laminar, \u201c1\u201dfor prototype. It would be quickly followed by an improved successor, the PL-2.Air Progress August/September 1963 \u201cWe Fly The Pazmany PL-1\u201d Don Downie ===Pazmany PL-2 === The basic configuration of the PL-2 incorporates two- place, side by side seating, a low wing of rectangular plan form, and tricycle landing gear. The overall layout is compact and light compared with some other contemporary aircraft in the same category. The structure is stressed to + 6 g\u2019s limit for safety and aerobatics. Aluminum 2024-T3 is the basic material. Landing gear and engine mount are made from 4130 steel tubes and plates. There are no double curvature skins in the whole airplane. Very few formed blocks are necessary, considering that the wing and horizontal tail have constant chord. The wing has a 15% thickness laminar airfoil, with the single spar located at the maximum thickness and is assembled as a unit to the fuselage and can be removed in approximately two hours. The wing-fuselage connection is provided by two bolts at the main spar and two bolts at the rear spar. The seats form an integral structure with the wing. Also, the control sticks and flap control lever are directly attached to the wing structure. The elevator trim is located in a centre box between the seats. Aileron and flaps are piano-hinged to the bottom skin. The elevator trim is located in a centre box between the seats. Aileron and flaps are piano-hinged to the bottom skin. Ailerons are mass-balanced and push-pull controlled, having differential displacement. The three-position flaps run through the fuselage. Top Speed 138.

At the time, Major-General Chao, vice-commander of the Air Academy, indicated that the academy was most pleased with the results of the program, although it was still in its infancy. Major-General T. M. Lee, commanding general of the Air Technical School, discussed the very substantial savings in airframe costs and a vital saving in training time for airframe mechanics. Because the cost of the program was only the plans themselves \u201cNationalist China may have picked up the smallest bill in history for the design of a military aircraft \u201dand Pazmany\u2019s \u201c yield comes largely from the satisfaction of knowing that many persons consider his aircraft the finest in its class.San Diego Union Tribune Sunday December 8, 1968 \u201cChina Gets A Bargain\u201d By Russell Van Densburgh Following the success of PL-1 and PL-2 as a military trainer in Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Pakistan and Sri Lanka began pilot training programs of their own based on Pazmany-designed aircraft. === Pazmany PL-4A === The PL-4A is a sport airplane intended to answer the need for a well designed, all-metal airplane which is easy to build, easy to fly, with low initial and operating costs, and folding wings so that it may be towed behind an automobile and stored at home. It is a low-wing airplane, VW-powered, with a closed or open cockpit large enough to accommodate even very large persons, and a generous baggage compartment. A \u201cT\u201d tail configuration improves rudder effectiveness and prevents the stabilator from interfering with the folded wings. Wing: In order to favor takeoff and climb performance, a high aspect ratio of 8 is used, which in combination with a large diameter, slow turning prop should provide good performance even at high altitude airports. The airfoil is the NACA 633418, which has a mild stall and a good overall performance even at \u201cstandard roughness.\u201d The 18% thickness provides a deep spar, high torsional rigidity, and makes possible the simple, compact fittings at the wing folding joint, which are band-sawed from aluminum plate. The chord is constant at 40 in., and there is no washout. The ailerons have differential travel to minimize, adverse yaw. They are hinged at the bottom skin with standard piano hinges, as in the PL-1 and 2, providing smooth airflow over the top of the \u201cdown\u201d aileron, and a good gap seal. The mass balance is concentrated in a lead weight attached to an arm extending into the wing box.The Pazmany PL4A By Ladislao Pazmany PDF 1999 www.pazmany.com Single seat monoplane, Top Speed 120 mph.

Markowski, Mark (1979). Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania: === Pazmany PL-9 Stork === The original German Luftwaffe Fieseler F-156 Storch was an outstanding WWII airplane, designed to take off and land in extremely short distances. The Storch had a take off ground roll of 131 feet and a landing roll of 36 feet with 13 miles per hour head wind. The Pazmany PL-9 Stork is a 3/4 replica, with the same flying and handling characteristics as the original German Aircraft. The PL-9 Stork is a professionally designed STOL aircraft. It has a well-proven aircraft configuration designed for a number of functions such as fish spotting, forest fire detection, farm work, missionary work, etc. It features a welded chrome alloy steel tube fuselage and aluminum sheet metal/fabric covered wings and empennage. The PL-9 Stork has a cruise speed of 104 mph with a standard Lycoming O-320/150 hp engine.Aircraft Spruce : PL-9 Stork www.aircraftspruce .com \u201cThe PL-9 was started in March 1990 with an extensive literature search. I acquired books, reports, manuals, microfilm reproductions and movies. I also talked with former Luftwaffe pilots who had flown the Storch.\u201d For the redesign of the PL-9 Stork maximum effort has been made to reproduce the performance of Fi-156.\u201dSport Aviation February 1991 The Pazmany PL-9 Stork\u201d' Ladislao \u201cPaz\u201d Pazmany With PL-9, amateur builders were provided with a STOL aircraft which will please the sport pilot, the nostalgia pilot and the bush pilot. \u201cPilots have always been fascinated by the Storch because it was capable of flying in and out of almost any open space and moping along at incredibly low airspeed when desired. The thought that occurs to any pilot is that one could fly the airplane with almost complete confidence that should engine failure occur, it could be landed anywhere within gliding range without fear of injury to its occupants.Sportsman Pilot Summer 1993 Editorial Review \u201cPazmany PL-9 Stork\u201d' The Stork is a high wing, two seat monoplane: Top Speed 116 mph.

It is still used as the standard for high quality homebuilding. While a great many people had searched for years to find some standard of airplane performance it was Pazmany, with his scrupulous attention to detail, combined with his aeronautical appreciation of flight data that made the breakthrough. Paz created and for several years conducted the Pazmany Efficiency Contest at Oshkosh \u2013 which gave EAAers one of their first real world evaluations of homebuilt performance Sport Aviation 1997 \u201cHall of Fame Inductions\u201d 1997 Now designers, engineers, pilots and companies could address how a plane could be improved, where technique came into play, where an aircraft stood in comparison to its peers, and what are the basic performance factors that allow for results. This was especially important in trying to compare different types of aircraft \u2013 Cubs, TaylorCrafts, and Sidewinders \u2013 with the low-speed performance of the airplane-aviator combination factor as a key to the overall efficiency coefficient. And at low, minimum speed, different type of aircraft could be compared, and evaluations also made within the design concept of an aircraft by its engineers.Sport Aviation July 1974 \u201cThe Pazmany Efficiency Test, Make it Work For You\u201d Phillip B.

The award is based on exemplary contributions to the history, growth, and development of aviation, and is accompanied by a trophy and inscription in the Hall Of Fame display.Sport Aviation 1997 Hall of Fame Inductions. ===Digital Age === Helped by friends and family, the Pazmany Aircraft Corporation opened an extensive multi-page website in 1999 complete with photos, descriptions, specifications, downloadable articles, videos, and technical support through e-mails, and aeronautical information through PDFs and e-books. It was thought by many to be innovative, and thorough in its informational ability. ===Retirement === In the summer of 1999 an ailing Ladislao Pazmany would travel to Oshkosh for the last time to attend the AirVenture, as it has now been called. Pazmany spoke to guests both formally in presentation and informally around the first showing of the now completed Pazmany PL-9 Stork, a plane that would have over hundred plan requests within its first years of availability. Partially incapacitated by Parkinson's disease, Pazmany, while infirmed, retained much of his acute intelligence, strong will, humor and appreciation of life, commenting, shortly before his death, and ignoring his adversities, \u201clife has many good things\u201d.Margarita Pazmany Interview: \"Biography\" Retirement March 2011 www.Pazmany.com === Awards === * Dr. August Raspet Award for Outstanding Contribution to Light Aircraft Design 1970 * EAA Award : Outstanding contribution to aerospace engineering and light airplane design 1970 1972 * AIAA Achievement Award.
