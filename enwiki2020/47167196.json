    "text": "Rainer K\u00fcschall (born 17 April 1947 in Flims, Switzerland) is a Swiss tetraplegic, car racer, inventor and designer. ==Accident== At the age of 16, K\u00fcschall suffered a severe injury to his cervical spine at the level of the C4-C6 vertebrae. At the time, there was no treatment available for quadriplegia, and he spent the following two years bedbound in different hospitals. K\u00fcschall then met the neurologist and neurosurgeon Ludwig Guttmann who founded Stoke Mandeville Hospital. Guttmann was the first to place K\u00fcschall into a wheelchair and a difficult period of rehabilitation followed.K\u00fcschall AG \u2013 When Rainer met Sir Ludwig Guttmann (English) ==Career== After many years of rehabilitation and sports, K\u00fcschall started his first job as an office clerk in 1976. However, this work proved impossible for him and he left after two weeks. At home, K\u00fcschall tinkered around with an old wheelchair and improved it with a few essential changes. This eventually led him to establish K\u00fcschall AG. K\u00fcschall began serial production of wheelchairs in 1976 \u2013 first in his living room, later in a factory. After a severe infection which caused a coma, K\u00fcschall sold his company to Invacare, a major medical equipment manufacturer based in the USA, in 1996. After several years K\u00fcschall recovered and took on the responsibility for engineering and product development as the company's research and development director.Conversation with Rainer K\u00fcschall, August 2011 (PDF, 227 KB) ==Invention of the monotube designs== Until the 1980s, wheelchairs were heavy vehicles which were almost impossible for the patient themselves to manoeuvre. In 1985, Rainer K\u00fcschall designed a completely new wheelchair which only weighed 14 instead of the usual 25 kilograms and had a volume that was 40% smaller. By reducing the weight and adding new adjustment possibilities for seated positions, K\u00fcschall increased the range of uses and the mobility of the wheelchair and established the now common monotube design. The product, which he called the Competition (known as Champion 3000 in the USA), was revolutionary at the time and is still one of the most copied basic designs for wheelchairs today. In 1986, K\u00fcschall received the award of the Museum of Modern Art.MoMA \u2013 The Collection \u2013 Rainer K\u00fcschall. Champion 3000 Adjustable Rigid-Frame Wheelchair. 1986 The Competition wheelchair was the first medical device added to the collection at the MoMA and is still exhibited there. One of its successor models weighs only 6.7 kilograms.K\u00fcschall AG \u2013 Product information File:K\u00fcschall wheelchair.jpg|Active wheelchair from K\u00fcschall in the Monotube-Design File:Medline F-1 manual wheelchair 2.JPG|Active wheelchair in the old box design ==Sporting career== K\u00fcschall began playing table tennis during his rehabilitation at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1960s and participated in the Summer Paralympics for the first time in 1968. From 1982 onwards, he devoted himself to wheelchair racing and broke the world record for almost every distance on several occasions. By the end of his paralympic sporting career in 1992, K\u00fcschall had won 21 paralympic medals and was five times world champion.Exotische Fahrzeuge (German, PDF, 446 KB) In 2002, K\u00fcschall bought an AC Cobra 427 which he has been driving ever since as the first Swiss quadriplegic with an international motor racing license. ==Notes== ==External links== * Website of the company * http://www.rehatreff.de/archiv/2005/2005_02_Kueschall_1005.pdf (PDF-File; 1,8 MB) * http://www.mandevillelegacy.org.uk/documents/Rainer2.pdf (PDF-File; 0,2 MB) Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss inventors Category:Swiss businesspeople Category:Swiss racing drivers Category:Swiss male table tennis players Category:Paralympic table tennis players of Switzerland Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Switzerland Category:Paralympic silver medalists for Switzerland Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Switzerland Category:Paralympic medalists in table tennis Category:Medalists at the 1968 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Paralympics Category:Table tennis players at the 1972 Summer Paralympics Category:Table tennis players at the 1976 Summer Paralympics Category:Table tennis players at the 1968 Summer Paralympics Category:Paralympic medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Paralympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Paralympics Category:Paralympic athletes of Switzerland ",
