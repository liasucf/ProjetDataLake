    "text": "The Cortesi Brothers were four siblings of Italian descent who became notorious crime figures in London during the first decades of the 20th century. The brothers were Augustus \u2018Gus\u2019 Cortesi, Enrico \u2018Frenchie\u2019 Cortesi, Paolo \u2018Paul\u2019 Cortesi and George Cortesi. Originating in Italy, the Cortesi family moved to Paris, France, where all four brothers were born. Their mother, Angele Cortesi, brought the family to England between 1891 and 1901, In 1901, the family is listed at Little Saffron Hill, Clerkenwell. Gus and George Cortesi had criminal records for assault in the 1910s. As the Cortesi brothers reached adulthood, they became involve in protection racketeering of gamblers and bookmakers. They were close to criminals in the Italian Sabini family. However, the two families became rivals because the Cortesi brothers believed they were being denied a fair share of proceeds from West End of London gambling clubs and wrung from bookmakers. The Cortesi Brothers allied themselves with Freddie Gilbert's Finsbury Boys and the premier Jewish gang led by Alfie Solomon. In 1922, the rivalry culminated in a confrontation at the Fratellanza Social Club at 23 Great Bath Street, Clerkenwell. It started when Harry Sabini pointed a revolver at them at the Cortesi brothers after learning about their alliance with the Finsbury gang. On 20 November 1922, Darby and Harry Sabini arrived at the club, probably to talk peace. Three women occupied one table and the only others present were the four Cortesi brothers and Alex Tomaso. Words were exchanged and tempers boiled over \u2013 Paul Cortesi threw a cup of hot coffee in the face of Harry Sabini and they started to fight. On this occasion it was the Cortesis who were armed with revolvers. Gus tried to shoot Darby Sabini, but his hand was knocked aside by one of the three women, Louisa Doralli, daughter of the secretary of the club. The shot went through a window. Darby Sabini was knocked down when Tomaso hit him with a bottle. Louisa then jumped in front of Harry Sabini as Enrico Cortesi went to shoot him. Harry pushed her away, allowing his brother to shoot Harry Sabini in the stomach. When police officers later attempted to arrest the Cortesi brothers at their homes, a large thwarted them. However, the Cortese brothers later surrendered. Gus and Enrico (Frenchie) Cortesi were jailed for three years for attempted murder. George and Paul Cortesi and Tomaso were found not guilty of assault and discharged. Augustus Cortesi (1886\u20131949) is buried in St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green. Enrico \u2018Frenchie\u2019 (1884\u20131954) died in Hackney, London. Paolo \u2018Paul\u2019 (1891\u20131938) died in Islington.
