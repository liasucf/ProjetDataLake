In 1998, the shopping centre tower won the annual European Shopping Centre Award that is presented by the ICSC, the International Council of Shopping Centres. The glass and steel tower has a staircase, an escalator and a glass lift, ferrying customers to the top. From the restaurant on the top floor (named Blue\u00b0), one has a view of Amsterdam's inner city. Besides many shops, it is also home to two department stores, various cafes and a restaurant.
