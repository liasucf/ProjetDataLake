    "text": "The Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a kinase inhibitor protein, that regulates many signaling pathways within the cell. RKIP is a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein family and has displayed disruptive regulation on the Raf-1-MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB signalling pathways, by interaction with the Raf-1 kinase. RKIP has also been shown to inhibit G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRK) when phosphorylated by protein kinase C.Lorenz K, Lohse MJ, Quitterer U (2003): Protein kinase C switches the Raf kinase inhibitor from Raf-1 to GRK-2. Nature 426: 574-579. Via this mechanism it has been shown to exert beneficial effects on cardiac structure and function.Schmid E, Neef S, Berlin C, Tomasovic A, Kahlert K, Nordbeck P, Deiss K, Denzinger S, Herrmann S, Wettwer E, Weidendorfer M, Becker D, Sch\u00e4fer F, Wagner N, Erg\u00fcn S, Schmitt JP, Katus HA, Weidemann F, Ravens U, Maack C, Hein L, Ertl G, M\u00fcller OJ, Maier LS, Lohse MJ, Lorenz K (2015): Cardiac RKIP induces a beneficial \u03b2-adrenoceptor-dependent positive inotropy.
