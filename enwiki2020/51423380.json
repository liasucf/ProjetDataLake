    "text": "The New Zealand Labour Party's Senior Whip administers the \"whipping in\" system that tries to ensure that party MPs attend and vote according to the party leadership's wishes. The position is elected by the Labour caucus members. The Senior Whip also acts as an intermediary between the backbenchers and the party leadership. Whenever Labour is in government the senior whip serves as the Chief Government Whip and when out of government serves as Chief Opposition Whip. All Labour whips have been members of the House of Representatives, with none coming from the Legislative Council before its abolition in 1950. The current senior whip is Michael Wood. ==List== The following is a list of all senior whips of the Labour Party: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=2|No. !Name !Portrait !Electorate !colspan=2|Term of office |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 1 | Andrew Walker | 75px | | 7 July 1916 | 28 August 1919 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 2 | James McCombs | 75px | | 28 August 1919 | 10 March 1921 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 3 | Dan Sullivan | 75px | | 10 March 1921 | 5 December 1935 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 4 | Bill Jordan | 75px | | 5 December 1935 | 11 June 1936 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 5 | Robert McKeen | 75px | | 11 June 1936 | 11 May 1939 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 6 | James O'Brien | 75px | | 11 May 1939 | 2 December 1942 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 7 | Arthur Shapton Richards | 75px | | 2 December 1942 | 5 August 1947\u2020 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 8 | Robert McFarlane | 75px | | 19 September 1947 | 27 June 1951 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 9 | Phil Connolly | 75px | | 27 June 1951 | 10 July 1952 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 10 | Joe Cotterill | 75px | | 10 July 1952 | 9 January 1958 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 11 | Henry May | 75px | | 9 January 1958 | 29 November 1972 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 12 | Ron Barclay | 75px | | 29 November 1972 | 29 January 1976 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 13 | Roger Drayton | 75px | | 29 January 1976 | 5 May 1978 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 14 | Russell Marshall | 75px | | 5 May 1978 | 13 February 1980 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 15 | Jonathan Hunt | 75px | | 13 February 1980 | 19 July 1984 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 16 | Michael Cullen | 75px | | 19 July 1984 | 18 August 1987 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 17 | Margaret Austin | 75px | | 18 August 1987 | 8 February 1990 |- ! style=\"background:\"| ! 18 | Trevor Mallard | 75px | | 8 February 1990 | 31 October 1990 |- ! style=\"background:\"| !
