Andrew \"Andy\" Shearer (January 26, 1864 - February 6, 1944) was a Canadian lumber merchant and amateur ice hockey player. He was the father of Hollywood actresses Norma and Athole Shearer and sound designer and recording director Douglas Shearer, and an older brother of zoologist Cresswell Shearer. ==Biography== Andrew Shearer was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1864 to James Traill Shearer and Eliza Shearer (n\u00e9e Graham).James Traill Shearer findagrave.com His father was born in Rosegill near Dunnet in Caithnesshire in northern Scotland in 1822 and his mother was born in Montr\u00e9al in 1827. James T. Shearer was a carpenter and lumber manufacturer and Andrew Shearer later worked as a lumber merchant and as a director of the James Shearer Company in Montr\u00e9al.Men of Canada. Cooper, John Alexander. 1901\u20131902. pg. 206. The Canadian Historical Company (Montreal and Toronto). He married Edith Mary Fisher in Montr\u00e9al in 1899 and they had three children: Douglas (b. 1899), Athole (b. 1900) and Norma (b. 1902). The family lived in a well-to-do neighborhood of Montr\u00e9al, but around 1919 the Canadian economy fell into a slump and he sold the business and lost most of the family money in the deal. He was forced to move the family to a more modest part of Montr\u00e9al, and his wife Edith soon took her two daughters to New York City to find jobs in the entertainment industry, whereas Douglas stayed with his father. All of his three children would later pursue careers within the film industry in Hollywood, Norma and Athole as actresses and Douglas as a sound designer and recording director. Mental health issues also came to plague the family. Andrew Shearer was allegedly prone to manic depression and Norma described how he used to move like a \"ghost like presence\" around the house.Norma Shearer: A Life. Lambert, Gavin. 1990. Alfred A. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group (New York) (978-0-394-55158-6). Both his daughters also came to suffer from mental instabilities. Andrew Shearer followed his family to California and died in Los Angeles in 1944 aged 80. He is buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California where his wife Edith and two daughters also rest. === Career in ice hockey === While in his 20s in Montr\u00e9al Andy Shearer played ice hockey in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, an early league organized to determine the Canadian champion. Shearer played with the Montreal Victorias between 1883\u20131891 and in 1888 he captained the club to a second place finish behind the Montreal Hockey Club, scoring four goals in seven games in the process. Shearer played at the forward position. ==Statistics== {| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" width=\"30%\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"2\" | League |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
