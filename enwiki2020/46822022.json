    "text": "Benedikt Benko Vinkovi\u0107 () (1581 - 2 December 1642) was a Catholic bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of P\u00e9cs (1630-1637) and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb (1637-1642). ==Early life== Vinkovi\u0107 was born in 1581 in Jastrebarsko (or Jaska). While some contemporary sources say his parents Petar and Magdalena were free peasants, other sources, including Toma Kova\u010devi\u0107, claim that they were serfs. During his early years, Vinkovi\u0107 was educated by Jesuits in seminaries in Erdelj, Zagreb, and Vienna. In 1606 Vinkovi\u0107 became rector of the Ilyrian College in Bologne, and in 1608 he received a PhD in philosophy. In 1611 Vinkovi\u0107 became archdeacon of \u010cazma, and in 1612 he became archdeacon of Komarnica. In 1619, Vinkovi\u0107 served as an envoy of the Croatian Diet sent to the Emperor to discuss Serb-related issues. In 1622, he was appointed as cathedral archdeacon. Due to Vatican policies on Ottoman- controlled territories in Europe, several Jesuit priests who fluently spoke different Slavic languages were appointed to higher positions in the Catholic church. Vinkovi\u0107 was appointed bishop in Ottoman-controlled P\u00e9cs in 1630. Aside from his native language, he also used Latin and Hungarian in his correspondences. Vinkovi\u0107 was a supporter of Martin Borkovi\u0107's counter- reformation activities in Me\u0111imurje. ==Activities related to Serbs== According to Serb historian Slavko Gavrilovi\u0107, Vinkovi\u0107 (and Petar Petreti\u0107) wrote numerous inaccurate texts meant to incite hatred against Serbs and Orthodox Christians, some of which included advice on how to Catholicize the Serbs. Vinkovi\u0107 also targeted the bishop of Mar\u010da, Maksim Predojevi\u0107, whom he reported to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith after refusing to support the conversion of the population of his bishopric to Catholicism. Vinkovi\u0107 estimated the number of Serbs in Slavonia to be about 74,000. In 1640 Vinkovi\u0107 requested Predojevi\u0107's deposition from the Roman Curia in his 1640 letter to the Pope's nuncio in Vienna. Vinkovi\u0107 claimed that Predojevi\u0107 was subordinate to him and Vinkovi\u0107 expected to receive some income from him. He also intended to appoint Rafael Levakovi\u0107 as bishop of Mar\u010da instead of Predojevi\u0107. In 1640, Vinkovi\u0107 wrote that Catholicized Serbs were the most ardent followers of the Catholic faith. In the same year he reported that Serbs still used the Cyrillic script. In 1642, Vinkovi\u0107 sent a report to emperor Ferdinand III discussing \"Vlachs\" (the pejorative term Vinkovi\u0107 used to describe Orthodox Serbs). In a 1673 letter, Vinkovi\u0107 reported that some Serbs from Istria, Senj, and Vinodolski had been converted to Catholicism. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Profile, Archdiocese of Zagreb website; accessed 8 January 2017.
