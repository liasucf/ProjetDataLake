It lies next to Mount Boundinga, also a sandstone rock. The road connecting Moanda to Bakoumba passes between the two rocks. The rock is respected by Moanda residents and almost holy to residents of the Third Zone district of the city. Several stories and legends about the rock exist. ==See also== * Mount Boundinga * Moanda Category:Mountains of Gabon ",
