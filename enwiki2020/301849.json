    "text": "Three Times Dope was a hip hop/rap group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania consisting of EST (Robert Waller), Chuck Nice (Walter Griggs) and Woody Wood (Duerwood Beale). 3xD, as they were called for short, were a part of the Hilltop Hustlers Crew (which also included Steady B, Cool C, Da Youngsta's, Mentally Gifted, and others). At first, they recorded under the name 3-D. ==Career== Their debut LP, Original Stylin' was well-received, peaking at #122 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart[ Billboard.com] and the group became well known for the terminology they created, such as \u201cAcknickulous\u201d and \u201cThe Giddy Up\u201d. 3xD's follow-up album Live from Acknickulous Land was an attempt at a more serious work. Despite spawning two minor hits, it failed to chart on the Billboard 200. It did, however, peak at #30 on Billboard's R&B;/Hip-Hop Album chart. 3xD later became closely associated with rapper/producer Kwam\u00e9. Their third album, Da Sequel, was not released until 1998. EST would eventually go on to become an award-winning songwriter for top-tier acts, most notably a Grammy nomination in 2005 for Destiny's Child's \"Cater 2 U\". ==Discography== ===As 3-DDiscogs.com=== * 1987 Crushin & Bussin' (12\") * 1988 From Da Giddy Up (12\") * 1988 Original Styling (LP) ===As Three Times DopeDiscogs.com=== *1988 The Greatest Man Alive (12\") *1988 Original Stylin' (LP) *1989 Funky Dividends (12\") \u2013 #22 Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop[ Billboard.com] * 1989 Original Stylin' (12\") * 1990 Live From Acknickulous Land (LP) * 1990 No Words (12\") * 1990 Mr. Sandman (12\") * 1990 Weak At The Knees (12\") \u2013 #41 Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop * 1991 Peace Ya'Self (12\") \u2013 #85 Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop * 1994 Da Sequel (12\") * 1999 The Sequel 3 (LP) ==Sampling== * Delegation(UK) \"Oh Honey\" - \"Funky Dividends\"(1989) * Marvin Gaye \"What's Going On\" - \"Increase The Peace\"(1989) ==References== Category:American hip hop groups Category:Musical groups from Philadelphia Category:Rappers from Philadelphia ",
