    "text": "Perspective view and ground plan, published in The Building News, 16 July 1875 Haseley Manor is a Grade II-listed country house in Haseley, Warwickshire, England. == Architecture == The house was built from 1875 to 1878, to designs by the architect William Young, for Alfred Hewlett, a coal merchant from Lancashire. It has walls of rock-faced stone and plain tile roofs, and is in the Gothic and Elizabethan styles, including a Gothic turret. It has been Grade II listed since January 1987, giving it legal protection from unauthorised alternations or demolition. == Uses == In 1930, the house was acquired by the Birmingham Society for the Care of Invalid Children, and put to use as a convalescent home and hospital school for girls. It was then purchased by Birmingham Education Authority and, from 1941, became Haseley Hall Residential Open-Air School For Boys, and was used as a children's home and orphanage. At some subsequent point is was owned by W & T Avery. By the mid-1960s, it was being used as staff college by the British Motor Corporation, and its nationalised successor, British Leyland. It was next used as a business and conference centre. It was acquired subsequently by Spitfire Bespoke Homes who subdivided and converted it into a number of private residences, completed circa 2018, including thirteen one, two and three- bedroom apartments. An additional nine residences, including three garden villas and five terraced houses, were created in its grounds. The project architects were Lapworth Architects. ==References== ==External links== * Haseley Manor, Warwick \u2013 includes aerial footage Category:1875 establishments in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Warwickshire Category:Grade II listed houses Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1875 Category:Defunct hospitals in England Category:Hospitals in Warwickshire Category:Defunct schools in Warwickshire Category:Birmingham City Council Category:British Leyland ",
