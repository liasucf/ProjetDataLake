    "text": "The Augusta County Committee of Safety was the shadow government of patriots from Augusta County, Virginia prior to and throughout the American Revolution. One of many such revolutionary committees of safety, the Augusta County committee is notable for writing the first known policy proposal to create a permanent independent state government and federal union of American colonies.Grigsby1, p.338 The paper was presented by Thomas Lewis at the Fifth Virginia Convention on May 10, 1776, preceding the United States Declaration of Independence by more than 50 days.VHD, p. 125 ==Background== After Parliament passed the Coercive Acts, also known as the Intolerable Acts, to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party, the Virginia House of Burgesses proclaimed that June 1, 1774, would be a day of \"fasting, humiliation, and prayer\" as a show of solidarity with Boston. In response, Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, dissolved the House of Burgesses. The burgesses then constituted themselves as the First Virginia Convention on August 1, 1774, and held a series of Virginia Conventions in place of the defunct House. On July 1, 1775, the convention passed an ordinance requiring each county of Virginia to elect a county committee to serve as the executive authority of that county,Waddell, p. 238 and on August 1, 1775, the following men were chosen for the Augusta County committee: * Sampson Mathews * Alexander McClanahan * Samuel McDowell And: * Michael Bowyer (alternate) * Thomas Lewis (alternate) * George Moffett (alternate)VHS, p. 110 Silas Hart was elected to chair the committee.Waddell, p. 238 The committee's independence proposal is believed to have been written between August 1, 1775 and the date of its presentation, May 10, 1776. It is unknown whether the paper itself is still extant, and is currently a lost work as the specifics of the proposal are unknown.Grigsby, p. 110 However, the presentation of the proposal was documented in the journal of the Fifth Virginia Convention as such: > \"A representation from the committee of the county of Augusta was presented > to the Convention, and read: setting forth the present unhappy situation of > the country, and, from the ministereal measures of vengeance now pursuing, > representing the necessity of making the confederacy of the United Colonies > the most perfect, independent, and lasting; and of framing an equal, free, > and liberal government, that may bear the test of all future ages.\"VHD, p. > 125 Hugh Blair Grigsby, Virginia historical scholar, states that the paper presented by Lewis was, \"the first distinct and responsible proposition in favor of independence and of a federal union which I have met with.\"Grigsby, p. 110 Gabriel Jones, the clerk of court for Hampshire County, referenced the proposal in an irascible letter to George Washington, on June 6, 1777. He states: \"These wretches, I mean inhabitants, of Augusta have forgot when they petitioned the Assembly for abolishing the established church and to declare independancy [sic] how they promised their lives and fortunes should be spent in supporting the Cause if their humble prayer should be granted.\" == References == ==Bibliography== * * * * * Category:Augusta County, Virginia Category:Virginia in the American Revolution Category:1775 in Virginia Category:Patriots in the American Revolution ",
