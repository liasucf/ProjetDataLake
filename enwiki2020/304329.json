    "text": "Claude Marcelle Jorr\u00e9, better known as Claude Jade (; 8 October 1948 \u2013 1 December 2006), was a French actress. She is known for starring as Christine in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's three films Stolen Kisses (1968), Bed and Board (1970) and Love on the Run (1979). Jade acted in theatre, film and television. Her film work outside France included the Soviet Union, the United States, Italy and Japan. ==Early career== The daughter of university professors, Jade spent three years at Dijon's Conservatory of Dramatic Art. In 1964 she played on stage 40 times the part of Agn\u00e8s in Moli\u00e8re's L'\u00e9cole des femmes. In 1966 she won the Prix de Com\u00e9die for Jean Giraudoux's stage play Ondine, performed at the Com\u00e9die Boulogne. She moved to Paris and became a student of Jean-Laurent Cochet at the Edouard VII theater, and began acting in television productions, including a leading role in TV series Les oiseaux rares. ==Films with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut== Love on the run While performing as Frida in Pirandello's Henri IV, in a production by Sacha Pito\u00ebff at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Moderne, Jade was discovered by New Wave film director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. He was \"completely taken by her beauty, her manners, her kindness, and her joie de vivre\", and cast her in the role of Christine Darbon in Stolen Kisses (1968). During the filming, Truffaut fell in love with her, and there was talk of marriage. Truffaut dubbed Claude Jade \u201cFrench cinema\u2019s little sweetheart\u201d and the director and his muse were soon a couple in real life, although Truffaut changed his mind about marrying her the night before their wedding.The toast scene is noted by Pauline Kael in 5001 Nights at the Movies, as well as in Ronald Bergan's obituary in The Guardian American critic Pauline Kael wrote that Jade \"seems a less ethereal, more practical Catherine Deneuve\". When Baisers vol\u00e9s became a hit, Truffaut promised that one day he would ask Claude Jade to help him continue the series. The director's love shines through his alter-ego Doinel in Stolen Kisses (1968), Bed and Board (Domicile Conjugal, 1970) and Love on the Run (1979), as Christine puts up with Antoine's foibles and affairs. The Guardian notes Memorable scenes pass through the mind like a montage: her teaching Antoine the best way to butter toast in the morning, their writing each other little notes, his calling her \"my little mother, my little sister, my little daughter\" in a taxi, and she replying she would rather be his wife; her attempts to guess Antoine's latest job, amusingly suggesting cab driver or water taster, her reaction when Antoine hangs a scissors on her ring finger, his affectionate response to her wearing glasses in bed, the medium tracking shot of her legs as she stops at a shop for tangerines then heads up the stairs, as one of the neighbourhood men longingly admires them. Playing the same character, Jade appeared in three Truffaut Movies. Truffaut uses the occasion to examine three states, three ages, of his heroine, played with the right middle-class gentility and innocence by Claude Jade: loved from a distance (Stolen Kisses); married and misled (Bed and Board); divorced but still on good terms (Love on the Run). ==The late 1960s in film== Some months after Truffaut's Stolen Kisses Claude Jade starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz (1969), as Mich\u00e8le Picard, a secret agent's anxious daughter, married to a reporter (Michel Subor). Recommended to Hitchcock by Truffaut, she was 19 years old when cast, with Dany Robin playing her mother. Hitchcock said he chose the two actresses to provide glamor, and later quipped, \"Claude Jade is a rather quiet young lady, but I wouldn't guarantee [that] about her behavior in a taxi\". Jade recounted that they \"talked in a Paris hotel about cooking, and I gave him my recipe for souffl\u00e9 and told him I liked Strangers on a Train, and that was that.\" Hitchcock said she resembled his former star Grace Kelly, and in France she was a younger Danielle Darrieux. Some of her scenes were deleted and restored for the director's cut of Topaz in 1999. Topaz was Jade's only Hollywood film. Universal Pictures offered her a seven-year contract, which she turned down reportedly because she preferred to work in French.Hitchcock by Bruno Villien, pp. 328-31; Screenshot from trailer of Hitchcock's Topaz with Claude Jade, Michel Subor and Dany Robin Director Tony Richardson's film Nijinsky (a.k.a. The Dancer) (1970), based on a screenplay by Edward Albee, was canceled during pre- production by producer Harry Saltzman. It was to have starred Jade as Vaslav Nijinsky's wife, alongside Rudolf Nureyev as Nijinsky and Paul Scofield as his lover Sergei Diaghilev. She had a leading role as Linda in Sous le signe de Monte-Cristo (Under the Sign of Monte Cristo) by Andr\u00e9 Hunebelle, a modern version of Alexandre Dumas' novel. Here the 19 years young actress starred alongside French cinema's veterans like Pierre Brasseur and Michel Auclair. Jade starred in \u00c9douard Molinaro's My Uncle Benjamin (Mon oncle Benjamin, 1969) alongside Jacques Brel. As Manette she refuses Brel's advances until he produces a marriage contract. At the End Manette realizes she prefers happiness to a marriage contract after all. Her career continued in Belgium, where she played a young English teacher who is fatally intrigued by a murderer (G\u00e9rard Barray) in the 1969 film The Witness. Her fianc\u00e9 is this movie was played by Jean-Claude Dauphin, to whom she was engaged at this time. Also in 1969 she starred as Helena in a film adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream by Jean-Christophe Averty, Le Songe d'une nuit d'\u00e9t\u00e9 . ==The 1970s in film and TV== In 1970 she reprised her part as Christine from Stolen Kisses in Truffaut's Bed and Board as a married woman. The Truffaut films influenced her type as lovingly gentle modern young woman in contemporary cinema, which she contrasted in ambivalent figures: Critic Vincent Canby praised her in work in G\u00e9rard Brach's The Boat on the Grass (Le bateau sur l'herbe, 1971), in which she starred as Eleonore, a young girl between two friends (Jean-Pierre Cassel, John McEnery). She starred in Hearth Fires (Les feux de la chandeleur, 1972) as Laura, a daughter who wants to reconcile her parents (Annie Girardot, Jean Rochefort) and who falls in love with her mother's best friend (Bernard Fresson). Alongside Robert Hossein she played the priest's love Fran\u00e7oise in Forbidden Priests (Pr\u00eatres interdits, 1973). In Home Sweet Home (1973), she played a hardened nurse who is changed by a love affair with a social worker (Jacques Perrin). Jade played a dual role in The Choice, 1976). She starred in three Italian films: as a private investigator in Number One (1973), as Tiffany, the girlfriend of a private eye (Frederick Stafford, her father from Topaz) in La ragazza di via Condotti (1973), and as Maria Teresa, an unhappily married woman in Eriprando Visconti's A Spiral of Mist (Una spirale di nebbia, 1977). She played a nun in Kita No Misaki - Cap du Nord (1976), by Japanese director Kei Kumai. In the same year she starred as Penny Vanderwood in Thinking Robots, based on a horror novel by George Langelaan. Among other films of the 1970s were Malicious Pleasure (Le malin plaisir, 1975), Trop c'est trop (1975) and the romantic comedy The Pawn (Le Pion, 1978), in which she starred as a young widow who wins the heart of her son's teacher (Henri Guybet). One year later Claude Jade played a third time her part as Christine Doinel in Truffaut's Love on the Run. In 1970 she starred as Orphan Fran\u00e7oise in mini-series Mauregard, directed by Truffaut's co-writer Claude de Givray. Other TV roles in the decade are Sheherazade (in Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade) and Louise de La Valli\u00e8re (in Le chateau perdu), Lucile Desmoulins (in La passion de Camille et Lucile Desmoulins). She starred in such television movies as Mamie Rose, La Mandragore, Monsieur Seul, Fou comme Fran\u00e7ois, Les anneaux de Bic\u00eatre, Ulysse est revenu, and, in her biggest success of that decade, as heroine Veronique d'Hergemont in the series The Island of Thirty Coffins. ==The 1980s in film and TV== In the 1980s Jade moved to Moscow for three years with her husband Bernard Coste, a French diplomat, and her son Pierre Coste (born in 1976). She starred in two Soviet films. In Teheran 43 (1981) she played the mysterious terrorist Fran\u00e7oise, with Alain Delon and an international cast. For Sergei Yutkevich's Lenin in Paris (1981), she played the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand, although without the rumored love affair with Vladimir Lenin.

She also appeared in TV movies, such as the thriller La grotte aux loups (1980); the drama Nous ne l'avons pas assez aim\u00e9e (1980); Treize (1981); a dual role in Lise et Laura (1982); A Girl in the Sunflowers (1984); the Italian miniseries Voglia di volare (1984); the French-Spanish-Canadian-German miniseries Le grand secret (1989) and in episode L'amie d'enfance of the series Commissaire Moulin. ==The 1990s in TV and film== During the 1990s Jade worked mainly in television, such as the TV series La t\u00eate en l'air and Fleur bleue, as guest star in Une femme d'honneur (ep.M\u00e9moire perdue), Inspecteur Moretti (ep.
