It is Gertner's first published book. ==Reception== The New York Times said that Mr. Gertner's \"portraits of Kelly and the cadre of talented scientists who worked at Bell Labs are animated by a journalistic ability to make their discoveries and inventions utterly comprehensible \u2014 indeed, thrilling \u2014 to the lay reader\". The Idea Factory was reviewed favorably by Foreign Policy, the New York Times, the Cleveland Plain-Dealer and others. Three adapted excerpts from the book were published in TIME. Facebook co-founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg recommended The Idea Factory to his book club in 2015, saying of the choice, \"[he is] very interested in what causes innovation \u2014 what kinds of people, questions and environments.\" ==See also== *Bell Labs *William Shockley *Claude Shannon ==References== Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Bell Labs Category:Books about scientists ",
