    "text": "Germaine Lubin and Herbert von Karajan, 17 May 1941 at the stage door of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Germaine (L\u00e9ontine Ang\u00e9lique) Lubin (1 February 1890 \u2013 27 October 1979) was a French dramatic soprano, best known for her association with the music of Richard Wagner. She possessed a brilliant voice but her later career was tainted with accusations of Nazi sympathies. ==Biography== ===Training=== Born in Paris, Germaine Lubin was soon taken to Cayenne in French Guiana where her father was a doctor, and from him she received her first piano lessons. She returned to live in Paris at the age of eight, and attended the Coll\u00e8ge S\u00e9vign\u00e9 with the intent of studying to become a doctor. Instead, in 1908 she entered the Paris Conservatory, where Gabriel Faur\u00e9 was then the director. Faur\u00e9 formed a high opinion of her voice \u2014and her statuesque beauty\u2014 and would accompany her personally in performances of his songs. She left the Conservatory in 1912 after winning three first prizes for her singing, and she was immediately in demand for performances. Throughout most of her career however she continued to take voice lessons, studying for 10 years from 1912 with the Franco-Russian soprano F\u00e9lia Litvinne. She would later work on roles with Lilli Lehmann and Marie Gutheil-Schoder. She also studied with Jean de Reszke, although she felt that he taught her little. ===Career=== In 1912 she made her debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, singing Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann, to an audience which included Claude Debussy and Paul Dukas, and she enjoyed a great success. At the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Albert Carr\u00e9 gave her the chance to appear in several contemporary operas, including Gabriel Faur\u00e9's P\u00e9n\u00e9lope (title role). She also sang Charlotte in Jules Massenet's Werther and the title role in Gustave Charpentier's Louise, and appeared in the world premiere of Le Pays by Guy Ropartz. In 1913 Lubin married the French poet Paul G\u00e9raldy. A son, Claude, was born to them in 1916. Their marriage lasted until 1926. (In 1918, Lubin met Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain and they conducted a warm correspondence for a while; P\u00e9tain declared a wish to marry her, had she been free. Lubin would remain an ardent admirer of P\u00e9tain until his death in 1951.Nicole Casanova. Isolde 39: Germaine Lubin. (Paris: Flammarion, 1974.)) Lubin made her first appearance at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1915, in Vincent d'Indy's Le Chant de la cloche, and continued to sing there for nearly 30 years. In addition to standard French works, she also found success in the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck and Richard Strauss, singing the first French performances of Elektra in 1932. She also created roles for d'Indy, Darius Milhaud, and Henri Sauguet (La chartreuse de Parme) and sang the title role in the 1935 revival of Ariane et Barbe-bleue by Dukas. In 1921 Lubin embarked on the series of Wagner roles for which she would be most admired: first Sieglinde in Die Walk\u00fcre, then Elsa (Lohengrin), and finally Eva (Die Meistersinger), all sung in French at the Op\u00e9ra. Later came Br\u00fcnnhilde (Der Ring des Nibelungen) (1928) and Kundry (Parsifal) (1938). She performed Ariadne under Strauss in Vienna, also singing Octavian and Agathe to critical enthusiasm, later taking part in the Paris premieres of Der Rosenkavalier in 1927Casanova, Nicole. Elle nous a quitt\u00e9s : Germaine Lubin. Lyrica, Novembre- D\u00e9cembre 1979, p74-75. and Ariadne auf Naxos at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1943.Wolff, St\u00e9phane. Un demi-si\u00e8cle d'Op\u00e9ra-Comique (1900-1950). Andr\u00e9 Bonne, Paris, 1953. 263 In 1930 she sang the role of Isolde (Tristan und Isolde) at the Paris Op\u00e9ra for the first time and met with an ecstatic reception. Her physical beauty \u2014she was tall, slim and blonde\u2014 and her strong, even voice made her ideal for the part. She went on to sing it again in Paris in 1938 (this time in German, conducted by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler), and in London in 1939 (at the invitation of Sir Thomas Beecham). In July 1939 she became the first Frenchwoman to sing Isolde at Bayreuth (under the baton of Victor de Sabata). At Bayreuth, she established friendships with members of the Wagner family. She was even complimented by Adolf Hitler, who said she was the finest Isolde that he had heard. Lubin hoped to sing also at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, having been recommended to the Met's management by Kirsten Flagstad. However, she terminated her contract weeks before arrival, and never sang in the United States. ===World War II=== After the German occupation of Paris in 1940, Jacques Rouch\u00e9 sought to re-open the Op\u00e9ra and invited Lubin to return to sing Alceste. This was followed by performances of Fidelio and Der Rosenkavalier, and in 1941 she again sang Isolde, this time with the visiting company of the Staatsoper from Berlin under the direction of Herbert von Karajan.Alan Riding. And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010.) p.155. She continued to associate with German acquaintances, and in 1942 she performed at a concert to mark an exhibition by Arno Breker, the sculptor who was closely associated with the Nazi leadership. (She later said that she had agreed to this performance as part of a deal to secure the release of Maurice Franck, the Jewish \"chef de chant\", or music staff/vocal coach, at the Op\u00e9ra.) These activities brought Germaine Lubin under suspicion of collaboration with the Nazis, and after the Liberation in 1944 she was arrested and imprisoned. At her trial in 1946, she was acquitted of the accusation after a number of testimonials were produced from people she had helped during the war. Nevertheless, she was sentenced to \"d\u00e9gradation nationale\" for life (subsequently reduced to five years), confiscation of property, and \"interdiction de s\u00e9jour\" (a form of exile). She found refuge with friends in Italy. For her part, Lubin denied all ties to Nazi Germany, and grew deeply bitter over her treatment at the hands of the French government. She once said that > I have suffered an enormous injustice. They curtailed my career by ten years > \u2014 my own people! The fact is that I knew some of the Germans when they came > to Paris during the occupation. This gave my enemies the chance to satisfy > their envy \u2026 If I saw the Germans in Paris \u2014and they had been more than kind > to me\u2014 it was to save my compatriots. It was my way of serving my country at > that particular moment. Nobody knows how many prisoners I had released \u2026 > When I spent three years in prison, they confiscated my ch\u00e2teau at Tours and > my possessions. Did anyone bother to ask me why I did not accept Winifred > Wagner\u2019s invitations to sing in Germany during the occupation? But my trial > was a complete vindication: I was completely cleared. Yes, they gave back > most of what they had taken \u2026Biographical sketch of Lubin at Subito- > Cantabile website, with photographs and recordings. ===Later years=== In 1950 Germaine Lubin had returned to Paris and sought to resume her career with a recital. Although she met with some sympathy and gave a few further performances, it was a difficult transition, and when in 1953 her son committed suicide she abandoned public performance entirely. For the remainder of her life she became a voice teacher, giving lessons at her home on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. Among her notable pupils was the leading soprano R\u00e9gine Crespin. Lubin died in Paris in 1979 at the age of 89. Lubin had a powerful voice of gleaming tonal splendour. By her own admission she was a forceful and demanding personality, often haughty and distant with other people, and she responded to the heroic dimension of the characters that she portrayed on the operatic stage. \"I do not like to sing the role of victims\", she said in an interview.\"Mais je n'aime pas chanter les victimes\". In an interview given to Le Quotidien de Paris on 10 July 1974, reproduced in Altamusica. ==Recordings== Although Germaine Lubin became the foremost French dramatic soprano during the 1920s and '30s, and indeed one of the finest opera singers to be heard anywhere during the inter-war period, her performances are not particularly well represented on disc. She recorded in 1929\u201330 a number of excerpts from her central repertoire, notably her Wagnerian roles as well as Tosca, Der Freisch\u00fctz and Sigurd. She also recorded a few songs by Schubert, Schumann and her erstwhile admirer Faur\u00e9. Among her later recordings from 1944 are two of the earliest featuring the young G\u00e9rard Souzay in which they perform duets by Leguerney and Blangini. In the 1950s, she also recorded a couple of songs by Hugo Wolf. In total her recorded legacy amounts to about two dozen items, many of which are available on CD reissues. ==References== *Martin Cooper, Elizabeth Forbes: article on Germaine Lubin in: Grove Music Online; ed. by L.
