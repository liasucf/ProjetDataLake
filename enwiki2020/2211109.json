    "text": "is a 2000 maze chase video game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation. It was later released for the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and Game Boy Advance. A remake of Ms. Pac-Man (1982), players control the titular character in her quest to stop a witch named Mesmerelda from stealing the Gems of Virtue. The game was well-received upon release, with critics applauding its simplicity and faithfulness to the arcade original. ==Gameplay== The player must navigate a series of mazes with Ms. Pac-Man. Along the way, she encounters such obstacles as moving blocks, exploding boxes, and locked doors. To help her, there is 'Pac-Dot Radar' to locate missing dots the player will need before being allowed to reach the next section of a level. Placed about the maze are such devices as spring tiles (to jump over the walls of the maze, and sometimes on top of them); switches, keys, hearts to regain her health, and 'Power Pellets' used to allow Ms. Pac-Man to eat all the enemies in the area for a limited time. As the player progresses, they must eat yellow dots scattered about each area, once they have eaten enough of these, a door will open, allowing them to reach a new section of that area. Each area has its own number of dots, as well as snacks such as fruit and pretzels. If the player can get all of these, as well as reaching the exit of the areas, they are rewarded with a 'Gold Star'. Once an area is beaten, the player can also play it again for a Time Trial, 'Gold Star', and 'Gold Clock'. Earning enough stars will unlock various features such as 'Bonus Rounds' between some levels, and a 'Movie Player' to watch the game's animated scenes. Each enemy and item that the player eats gives them more points, which can earn them additional lives, as well as allow them to unlock other features. After beating the two in-game bosses (the green 'Gobblin' and the final boss 'Mesmerelda'), the player receives the 'Witch's Key' which allows them to unlock various locations in the earlier areas. However, the game requires the player to beat the bosses twice in order to see the game's ending. The multiplayer mode allows up to 4 people to play simultaneously (although a player can play solo, verse three computer-controlled characters). The original arcade version of Ms. Pac-Man is freely playable as an option on the main menu, similar to how the original Pac-Man arcade game was freely available on the main menu of the 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World game. This was not included in the Game Boy Advance version. ==Plot== Professor Pac learns that the evil forces have taken control of the Enchanted Castle, using black magic. The princess has vanished, and a witch named Mesmerelda is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage) to control the \"four wonders\" (areas of Pac-Land). These four areas each have enemies in them, and are blocked by mysterious force fields. Professor Pac creates a device called the Pactrometer, which allows Ms. Pac-Man to go to these areas to recover the gems before Mesmerelda can get them first. However, as the Professor is telling Ms. Pac-Man this, he gets sucked into a mirror by the witch, leaving Ms. Pac-Man with the Pactrometer. As she journeys through the areas, she is helped by video messages that the Professor placed in the Pactrometer, and by holograms of Professor Pac. As Ms. Pac-Man gathers the last of the gems, they are stolen by Mesmerelda. A battle ensues and the witch is defeated and runs away, leaving behind a key. Without the key, Mesmerelda is unable to get into the castle to reach her crystal ball, and thus cannot use the gems. Ms. Pac-Man returns to fight for the gems, and this time wins, regaining the gems. With them and the Pactrometer, the witch's spell is broken, and Mesmerelda returns to her true form as the princess. Professor Pac, Ms. Pac-Man, and the princess proceed to celebrate their victory. ==Reception== The Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo 64 versions received \"mixed or average reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Nintendo Power said of the N64 version, \"The multiplayer mode stumbles,\" while N64 Magazine gave it a much harsher description: \"The Multiplayer mazes are viewed from three- quarters angle \u2014 and the blurry visuals make it all but impossible to see what's going on.\" They also continue comparing the tag games as being \"ruined by the fact that the chasers move twice as fast as the other players.\" Their final comment on the multiplayer mode was simply \"Terrible.\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation version a score of 23 out of 40. Game Informer gave the same console version a favorable review over a month before it was released Stateside. Chris Charla of Next Generation said of the PlayStation version in its December 2000 issue: \"The maze format makes the game too limited to be the next Ape Escape, but it's definitely worth a look.\" Later, in its January 2001 issue, Daniel Erickson called the N64 version \"A solid package for just about any gamer.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 video games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Maze games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Pac-Man Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games about witchcraft Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists ",
