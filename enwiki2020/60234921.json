    "text": "Anuna De Wever (born 16 June 2001) is a Belgian climate activist and was one of the leading figures in the School strike for the climate movement in Belgium. == Early life and activism == De Wever was born in Mortsel, Belgium. With Kyra Gantois and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier, De Wever became one of the leading figures in the School strike for climate movement in Belgium. As a result, from February to May 2019 she had a weekly column in the magazine HUMO. In aftermath of the school strikes in Belgium centre-right Flemish minister for the environment Joke Schauvliege was obliged to resign after falsely claiming that the Belgian State Security Service had information indicating that the climate strike was a political front organisation. Personal differences led to a fissure within the Belgian Youth for Climate movement, with the departure of co-founder Kyra Gantois in August 2019. De Wever made an appearance at the 2019 Pukkelpop music festival attempting to engage the audience to call attention to the climate issues. This call angered some festival goers who harassed her group, hurled bottles of urine at her, and followed her back to her campsite, uttered death threats and destroyed their tent, forcing security to intervene. Because the attackers had been carrying a variant of the Flag of Flanders favoured by far-right elements of the Flemish Movement, the organizers banned such flags from the event, confiscating 20. In October 2019, De Wever was among the youngest climate activists to set sail on the Regina Maris for a low-carbon trans-Atlantic journey to the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Santiago, Chile. In February 2020, after returning from South America, she took an internship with the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance in the European Parliament, without becoming a member of the party. ==Awards== * In May 2019, De Wever and Kyra Gantois jointly received the Ark Prize of the Free Word. * In September 2019, De Wever and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier received Amnesty International Belgium's Ambassador of Conscience Award on behalf of Youth for Climate. ==References== Category:Living people Category:2001 births Category:Climate change environmentalists Category:Belgian women environmentalists Category:Youth activists Category:People from Mortsel Category:21st-century Belgian women Category:Climate activists ",
