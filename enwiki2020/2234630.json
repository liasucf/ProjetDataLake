A Little book of Celtic Saints Belfast: Appletree Press, 1995, , p. 59 being appointed in 661.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 219 Colman resigned the Bishopric of Lindisfarne after the Synod of Whitby called by King Oswiu of Northumbria decided to calculate Easter using the method of the First Ecumenical Council instead of his preferred Celtic method. The change to the Roman Method led Colm\u00e1n to leave and travel back to Scotland and eventually, back to Iona. Later tradition states that between the years 665 and 667, Colman founded several churches in Scotland before returning to Iona. However, there are no seventh-century records of such activity by him. From Iona he sailed for Ireland, settling at Inishbofin in 668 ADGrattan-Flood, William. \"St. Colman.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 12 May 2013 where he founded a monastery, the School of Mayo.Walsh A New Dictionary of Saints p. 127 When Colman came to Mayo he brought with him half the relics of Lindisfarne, including the bones of St. Aidan and a part of the true cross. This was reputed to be in Mayo Abbey until its vanishment during the Reformation in 1537. Colman was stepping into a landscape that had been decimated by the plague of 664-665. He may have been reviving an earlier church on the island or one in the area in central Connacht where Mag \u00c9o was founded later. On Inishbofin a rift occurred between the Irish and the English \"because in summer the Irish went off to wander on their own around places they knew instead of assisting at harvest, and then, as winter approached, came back and wanted to share whatever the English monks had gathered.\" What was the reason for their intermittent absence? Earlier commentators suspected that the two nations came from different agricultural backgrounds and that the Irish intermittently removed themselves from the island with the monastery\u2019s livestock for the purpose of \u2018booleying\u2019, a form of transhumance. It is also possible that the Irish visited their kinsfolk on the mainland. Returning to the island in winter, they helped to consume the fruits of the Saxons' labours. This situation inevitably led to tensions within the community. Disputes arose between the Saxon and Irish monks after a short time. Colman brought his Saxon followers onto the mainland and founded a monastery for them at \"Magh E\u00f3\" - the Plain of Yew Trees, subsequently known as \"Mayo of the Saxons\". Colman's last days were spent on the island of Inishbofin, where he died in 674.Brett, Joe. \"The Monastic Settlement of 'Mayo of the Saxons'\", Mayo Abbey Parish Magazine, 1994 His feast is celebrated on 8 August and on 13 November. ==Citations== ==References== * * Walsh, Michael A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West London: Burns & Oats 2007 ==External links== * Category:Bishops of Lindisfarne Category:7th-century bishops Category:605 births Category:675 deaths Category:7th-century Irish people Category:7th- century Christian saints Category:Medieval Irish saints Category:Northumbrian saints Category:Colombanian saints Category:People from County Galway Category:Irish expatriates in England ",
