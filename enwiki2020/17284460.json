Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, claiming: \"Movies like this do not grab you by the throat. You have to be receptive. The first time I saw \"Chelsea Walls,\" in a stuffy room late at night at Cannes 2001, I found it slow and pointless. This time, I saw it earlier in the day, fueled by coffee, and I understood that the movie is not about what the characters do, but about what they are. It may be a waste of time to spend your life drinking, fornicating, posing as a genius and living off your friends, but if you've got the money, honey, take off the time.\"Roger Ebert review of Chelsea Walls, RogerEbert.com; accessed July 4, 2015. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2001 films Category:2001 drama films Category:2001 independent films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films Category:American spy films Category:English-language films Category:Camcorder films Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films about suicide Category:American films based on plays Category:Films set in hotels Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films scored by Jeff Tweedy Category:Films directed by Ethan Hawke Category:Films produced by Christine Vachon Category:Killer Films films Category:Lionsgate films Category:2001 directorial debut films ",
