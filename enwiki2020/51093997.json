    "text": "Claude Guimond de La Touche (17 October 1723 \u2013 14 February 1760) was an 18th- century French playwright and poet. == Life == After completing his studies in Rouen, La Touche entered the Society of Jesus where he remained until the age of fourteen. After leaving, he devoted himself to poetry and began with an ode on the birth of the Duke of Burgundy entitled Mars au berceau (1751, in-8\u00b0). The only tragedy that he made and which made his name live, Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride, was presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais 4 June 1757. If one believes mademoiselle Clairon, the fifth act, which the actors were not satisfied with, was re-built this very day by the author, yet the curtain rose at half past five. The success of Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride was all enthusiasm. Guimond asked again loudly, let himself get on stage and fainted with joy as he withdrew. His play, remarkable in several respects and remained as one of the best second-rate tragedies, however, was abused by Fr\u00e9ron, Grimm and Geoffroy who called it a \"burlesque farce,\" an \"extravagant hodgepodge.\" In imitation of the Greeks, or simply following the example of Coll\u00e9, the author fulfilled his subject, without introducing any love episodes, and maintaining the simplicity of Euripides' plan failed not of interest nor pathetic. Many loans were reported: the scene of recognition was drawn entirely from the opera Iphig\u00e9nie by Duch\u00e9 in 1704 ; the one where Iphig\u00e9nie asks Orestes about the fate of the family of Atreus, whose background is in Euripides, recalled by some details Oreste et Pylade by Lagrange-Chancel (1697), but improving it. The author was also criticized for exaggerating Thoas' stupid ferocity uselessly for the action, and for not having enough prepared nor motivated the outcome. As for style, it was said that the heavy, monotonous, versification, the declamatory pieces and Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride language mistakes were saved by the energy and heat that animated all of the work that was printed several time (Paris, 1758, 1784, 1811, 1815, 1818, in-8\u00b0). Guimond de La Touche also left an \u00c9p\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019amiti\u00e9 (London, 1758, in-8\u00b0) ; les Soupirs du clo\u00eetre, ou le Triomphe du fanatisme (1765, in-8\u00b0), a satire against his former colleagues, the Jesuits. == Sources == * Gustave Vapereau, Dictionnaire universel des litt\u00e9ratures, Paris, Hachette, 1876, p. 958 == External links == * Claude Guimond de La Touche on Data.bnf.fr * Claude Guimond de La Touche on C\u00c9SAR Category:18th- century French dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century French poets Category:18th-century male writers Category:1723 births Category:People from Ch\u00e2teauroux Category:1760 deaths ",
