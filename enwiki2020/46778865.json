On the northwestern side of the mountain the remains of a rampart and ditch system from the end of the 17th century may be made out. In the area of the Ro\u00dfberg the fortifications (known as Schanzen) run from the Schanzenh\u00e4usle via the Ringelschanze to the zur Ro\u00dfbergschanze. Between the Ringelschanze and the Ro\u00dfbergschanze there are continuous, linear structures with several triangular bastions. In 1690 battles were fought at Breitnau, but by the early 18th century the fortifications had lost their military significance. Immediately next to the Ro\u00dfbergschanze lies the Breitnau Friends of Nature house (Naturfreundehaus Breitnau, ).
