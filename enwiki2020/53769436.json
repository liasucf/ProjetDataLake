In 2016, NPR named Dylan Golden Aycock's Church of Level Track one of the \"Top 10 Solo Guitar Records of 2016\" Uncut Magazine described him as \"respectfully expanding on Takoma School roots, moving towards the sort of chamber folk compositions mastered by James Blackshaw and William Tyler.\" In the Bandcamp article \"New Directions in Acoustic Guitar\" Pitchfork writer Marc Masters writes \"Aycock credited with nine different instruments, including violin, drums, pedal steel guitar and synthesizers add atmosphere to his thoughtful picking.\" ==Background== Aycock began making music as a turntablist in 2004 before later moving to drums and in 2011 he began playing solo instrumental guitar. He has released music under his own name as well as Talk West, The Doldrums, and in 2007 was a member of the band Mar whose debut album was recorded in Iceland with members of m\u00fam and The Album Leaf.

Aycock formed The Doldrums with Mark Kuykendall at the age of 19. Before releasing music under his own name, Aycock used Talk West as working title for his solo music. Most of the Talk West releases were focused around the Pedal Steel guitar and cassette. In 2016, Aycock released a critically acclaimed solo album entitled Church of Level Track, The album takes its name from the infamous train moniker artist Colossus of Roads.

The film score was composed by Bruce Langhorne who is most known for his session work in Greenwich Village in the early '60s. Bruce Langhorne accompanied Bob Dylan, Odetta, Richie Havens, and many others. In 2017, a few months before Langhorne's death, Aycock compiled tribute album to Bruce Langhorne with Loren Connors.
