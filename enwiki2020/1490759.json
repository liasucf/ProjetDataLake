    "text": "Oberkochen is a town (officially a city, despite its size) in the Ostalbkreis, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in Germany, central Europe. ==Name== The name \"Oberkochen\" consists of the two German words \"ober\", meaning \"above\" or \"upper\", and \"Kocher\", the name of the local river. The name indicates, that this settlement lies above the river Kocher or on its upper part. The river Kocher has its spring just to the south of Oberkochen and runs to the north. Therefore, the village next to the north of Oberkochen is Unterkochen, with the German \"unter\" meaning \"lower\" or \"under\". ==Geography== Oberkochen is located in and above the valleys of the rivers Kocher and Langertbach between the area of Albuch in the west and north and the area of H\u00e4rtsfeld in the east. The highest point in the area of Oberkochen is the top of the Volkmarsberg mountain (743 m above sea level). Directly south of the city the river Kocher has its origin. The city consists of two main parts: the downtown area with the city center, Spitztal, Lenzhalde and Brunnenhalde and the Heide area, which lies 100 m above the city on a hill to the northeast. ==History== ===Timeline=== (all dates after christ) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! year !! event |----- | 1137 ||align=\"left\" | first mentioning of the name \"Cochon\" in a table of goods of the Ellwangen Abbey |----- | 1147 ||align=\"left\" | first mentioning of the name \"Kochen\" in modern spelling |----- | 1337 ||align=\"left\" | first mentioning of the name \"Oberkochen\" in the table of goods of the Ellwangen Abbey |----- | 1343 ||align=\"left\" | first parish in Oberkochen |----- | 1535 ||align=\"left\" | a general set of village rules is formulated |----- | 1551 ||align=\"left\" | blast furnace is established on the source of the river Kocher |----- | 1578 ||align=\"left\" | Oberkochen gets a new detailed set of village rules |----- | 1582 ||align=\"left\" | until 1583.

Since 1933 Oberkochen has a mayor, who wears a livery collar since Oberkochen became a city in 1968.

It took nearly 200 years to reach a population of 500 again. In the 19th century the population saw a greater rise due to the industrialisation. The next remarkable growth took place after World War II, when the population quadrupled from 2,000 to 8,000 people in just 20 years. One of the main reasons for this growth was the relocation and expansion of the company Carl Zeiss. In 1968 Oberkochen became officially a city, which is remarkable, because at this time a population of 10,000 people was a condition for towns in Germany to become a city. The reason for the premature change in the status of Oberkochen was the intense growth of the population prior to 1968, which made the mayor Gustav Bosch, as well as the responsible authorities believe, that a population of 10,000 would be reached soon. Therefore, the change of the status of Oberkochen from town to city was applied for and finally granted. Despite these expectations and actions the population stalled instead and even saw a slight decrease. Today, there are more commuters working in Oberkochen than working people living there. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! year !! population !! foreignersFl\u00e4che, Bev\u00f6lkerung - Statistisches Landesamt Baden -W\u00fcrttemberg(online) |----- | 1618 || align=\"right\" | c. 500 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1648 || align=\"right\" | c. 100 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1830 || align=\"right\" | 630 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1880 || align=\"right\" | 1,202 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1900 || align=\"right\" | 1,176Fl\u00e4che, Bev\u00f6lkerung - Statistisches Landesamt Baden -W\u00fcrttemberg(online) || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1925 || align=\"right\" | 1,512 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1939 || align=\"right\" | 2,002 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1950 || align=\"right\" | 3,681 || align=\"right\" | n/a |----- | 1961 || align=\"right\" | 7,979 || align=\"right\" | 127 |----- | 1970 || align=\"right\" | 8,648 || align=\"right\" | 360 |----- | 1980 || align=\"right\" | 8,118 || align=\"right\" | 547 |----- | 1990 || align=\"right\" | 8,446 || align=\"right\" | 682 |----- | 1995 || align=\"right\" | 8,589 || align=\"right\" | 830 |----- | 2000 || align=\"right\" | 8,271 || align=\"right\" | 764 |----- | 2005 || align=\"right\" | 8,206 || align=\"right\" | 844 |----- | 2008 || align=\"right\" | 8,040 || align=\"right\" | 859 |----- | 2009 || align=\"right\" | 7,915 || align=\"right\" | 864 |----- | 2010 || align=\"right\" | 7,816 || align=\"right\" | 856 |----- | 2011 || align=\"right\" | 7,755 || align=\"right\" | 651 |----- | 2012 || align=\"right\" | 7,815 || align=\"right\" | 713 |----- | 2013 || align=\"right\" | 7,833Jahresbericht 2013 in Zahlen.
