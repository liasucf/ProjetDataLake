The former ranch is located off Utah State Route 35. Some or all of the ranch is included in what is now the Diamond Bar X Ranch. Stewart Ranch was a \"recreational ranch\" established around 1902 in Pine Valley, a mountain valley along the North Fork of the Provo River in the western side of the Uintah Mountains, about east of Salt Lake City, Utah. All but one of the buildings are in Wasatch County, east of the Provo River, across which lies Summit County. William M. Stewart visited the valley in 1900 and purchased . With purchases by a total of four Stewart brothers the ranch eventually was in size. The ranch was bought in 1931 by in-laws, the Hewletts, who built a dairy barn and otherwise made changes. \"Included among the eight buildings are the ranch homes of the four Stewart brothers who founded the ranch, the ranch homes of the two Hewlett brothers, in-law relations of the Stewarts who purchased the ranch in 1931, the ranch foreman's house, and the dairy barn. There are a number of other structures and buildings on the ranch which are not included in the nomination because they either have been altered, constructed within the past 50 years, or lack significant historical associations.\" \"Stewart Ranch is located in Pine Valley, a small mountain valley on the western edge of the Uinta Mountains, approximately 60 miles east of Salt Lake City. The valley, which runs generally north and south, is two or three miles in length, several hundred yards wide, and consists of a combination of open meadow lands and forested areas. The North Fork of the Provo River runs the length of the valley and converges with the South Fork at the southern end of the valley. Also extending the length of the valley is a dirt road which passes through a series of fences and gates that mark some of the current property lines.\" \"The eight significant buildings that are included in the Stewart Ranch Thematic Resources nomination are as follows: *Ethelbert White/William M. Stewart Ranch House (1890) *Barnard J. Stewart Ranch House (1911) *Samuel W. Stewart Ranch House (1913) *Charles B. Stewart Ranch House (1918) *Stewart Ranch Foreman's House (1929-30) *Lester F.
