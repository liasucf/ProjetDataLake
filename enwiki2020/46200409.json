    "text": "Macau and vicinity, 1912 There is currently one island in the territory of Macau. It is located at the south of Macau Peninsula and at the east of the Hengqin Island of Zhujiang, Guangdong Province, China. The island remains unnamed since its creation in the late 1990s, after the reclamation project of Cotai which filled up the channel between the Taipa Island and Coloane Island. Historically, the unnamed island was under the administration of the Municipality of the Islands, it is however now divided into the Taipa, Coloane and Cotai districts. The Macau Peninsula was once an island on the Pearl River Delta. It has linked to Mainland China as a result of sedimentation to become a peninsula a couple of thousand-years ago. Apart from this case, all of the Macanese former islands were merged either to the Macau Peninsula or the newly unnamed island directly or indirectly as the result of artificial land reclamation. ==Peninsula(s)== *Macau Peninsula ==Island(s)== *The Island of Taipa, Coloane, and Cotai. *Hengqin: formerly known as the Dom Jo\u00e3o e Montanha of the Lapa, Dom Jo\u00e3o, and Montanha islands, part of the islands is under Macanese control as enforced by a Macanese-Chinese agreement.Decis\u00e3o do Comit\u00e9 Permanente da Assembleia Popular Nacional da Rep\u00fablica Popular da China relativa \u00e0 delega\u00e7\u00e3o de poderes na Regi\u00e3o Administrativa Especial de Macau para o exerc\u00edcio de jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o no novo campus da Universidade de Macau a instalar na Ilha da Montanha(in Portuguese)REGI\u00c3O ADMINISTRATIVA ESPECIAL DE MACAU(in Portuguese) * Aterro da \"Zona A\" dos Novos Aterros Urbanos * Aterro da \"Zona C\" dos Novos Aterros Urbanos ==Former islands== *Macau Island *Taipa - was itself two islands *Coloane *Ilha Verde: connected to Macau Peninsula in 1895 when a causeway (now Avenida do Conselheiro Borja) was built. *Ilh\u00e9u de Macau-Siac: connected to the northeast of Macau Peninsula in January 1921, during the landfilling works for the Macau's Outer Harbour expansion. *Ilha Kai Kiong: connected to Macau International Airport, Taipa in 1995. *Pedra d'Areca *Ilh\u00e9u das L\u00e1zaras: connected to the northeast of Coloane. ==See also== *List of islands *List of islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong *Geography of Macau ==References== Category:Macau Category:Macau Peninsula Category:Islands of Macau Category:Islands of the South China Sea Macau ",
