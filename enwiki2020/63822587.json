    "text": "Shuchi Anand is an Indian-American nephrologist and clinical researcher investigating chronic kidney disease, tubulointerstitial disease, and global health. She is an assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center. == Early life and education == Shuchi Anand was born in India and moved to the United States with her family at age 12. After observing disparities in healthcare on a visit back to India, Anand became interested in medicine. She completed a medical degree at Washington University School of Medicine in 2006 and internal medicine training at the Brigham and Women's Hospital with Partners HealthCare and Harvard Medical School. She completed a master of science in clinical epidemiology and a nephrology fellowship at Stanford University School of Medicine. Anand worked in developing countries to gain experience in global health. During a John E. Fogarty International Center fellowship, she researched under at the (CCDC) to study the prevalence and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anand worked on a large project, the Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Surveillance Study, through which clinic and home visits gathered information related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and CKD from thousands of people in three large South Asian cities: New Delhi, Chennai, and Karachi. Anand accompanied interviewers as they went door-to-door to conduct surveys in India and then helped analyze data. A 2015 paper on which Anand was the lead author estimated one in twelve people living in New Delhi and Chennai have evidence of CKD, with diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes and hypertension that put them at risk of a heart attack, end-stage renal death or other adverse outcomes. The Fogarty fellowship segued into an NIH career development grant that allowed her to expand upon her work in India. With support from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Anand conducted mentored research on the epidemiology and management of CKD in South Asians and found, for example, that the prevalence of CKD among people in urban India is similar to that of Indians who emigrated to the U.S., but those living in India are more likely to face worse outcomes. == Career == Anand is an assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center and serves as director of the center for tubulointerstitial kidney disease. Her clinical research areas include nephrology and tubulointerstitial disease. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Stanford Medical School alumni Category:21st-century American scientists Category:21st- century American women scientists Category:American pathologists Category:Women medical researchers Category:American medical researchers Category:American nephrologists Category:Women neurologists Category:21st- century American women physicians Category:21st-century American physicians Category:Stanford University School of Medicine faculty Category:Washington University School of Medicine alumni Category:Indian emigrants to the United States ",
