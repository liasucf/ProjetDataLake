    "text": "Victoria Hern\u00e1ndez (March 23, 1897 \u2013 April 11, 1998) was an Afro-Puerto Rican music entrepreneur. Though a talented musician, she devoted her career to the business aspects of the music industry. In 1927, she opened the first Latin music store in New York City, one of only sixteen businesses owned by Puerto Rican migrant women. She served as an agent to locate music talent for record labels and bandleaders and at one point owned her own record label. After following her brother to Mexico City, Hern\u00e1ndez returned to the Bronx and founded Casa de M\u00fasica, later renamed to Casa Hern\u00e1ndez. The music store she founded in 1941, now known as Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez has the longest record of continuous operation of any music store in New York City. ==Early life== Victoria Hern\u00e1ndez was born on March 23, 1897 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rosa Espinoza. Her parents were Afro-Puerto Rican tobacco workers and her father was a talented guitarist. The oldest daughter in the family, all of her siblings Rafael (1891/92-1965), Jes\u00fas \"Pocholo\" (1899\u20131982) and Rosa Elvira (1905\u2013?) would become accomplished musicians. They were encouraged by their maternal grandmother, who lived with the family, to study music and Victoria became a skilled cellist, violinist and pianist. ==Career== In 1919, Hern\u00e1ndez moved with her mother, grandmother and siblings to New York City and began work as a factory seamstress, who gave piano lessons to generate additional income. Within eight years, in 1927, she and her brothers bought a store, located at 1735 Madison Avenue in East Harlem. The store, Almacenes Hern\u00e1ndez (Hern\u00e1ndez Music Store), the first \"Puerto Rican\u2013owned music store in New York City\", carried records and guitars, as well as music rolls for player pianos. In the back rooms, Hern\u00e1ndez gave music lessons to students like Tito Puente and Loco Esteves and her brother Rafael composed music. In the era, it was unacceptable for respectable Latina women to perform as popular musicians, so though ostensibly owned by the siblings, Victoria ran the business to support the family and give her brothers an income so that they could devote their time to composing and performing. According to the historian Virginia S\u00e1nchez Korrol, at the time Hern\u00e1ndez was one of only sixteen Puerto Rican women operating businesses in the United States. In 1927, Hern\u00e1ndez added her own recording label, Hispano to her enterprises. Her label produced several records for Las Estrellas Boricuas and Los Diablos de la Plena, two groups known in the Puerto Rican music community, as well as songs composed by Rafael, including his now well-known song, Pura Flama. She successfully sold many records until her bank failed as a result of the Great Depression, forcing her to close the label in 1929. As her business grew, Hern\u00e1ndez needed more space and relocated to 1724 Madison Avenue in 1930. In 1932, Rafael formed a group, which he named Cuarteto Victoria (Victoria Quartet) in her honor. Hern\u00e1ndez served as his booking agent and organized his tours and recording sessions. To contest the stereotype that musicians were irresponsible bohemians, Hern\u00e1ndez insisted that the quartet forego the traditional costumes featuring ruffled-sleeve shirts and instead wear suits and ties. As she gained a reputation, Hern\u00e1ndez began working with record labels like Columbia Records, Decca and Victor to book instrumentalists for recording sessions and with bandleaders like Xavier Cugat, who were searching for musicians. Hern\u00e1ndez also often assisted the musicians themselves by advancing them money in exchange for a cut of their later earnings. Her benevolence earned her the honorific La Madrina (the godmother) from some, but also less flattering titles by those who felt her charges were usurious. Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernande The Hern\u00e1ndez siblings sold Almacenes Hern\u00e1ndez to the Verne Records owner, Luis Cuevas in 1939 and both Rafael and Victoria moved from the United States. After first going to Puerto Rico and reforming the group Cuarteto Victoria, they recorded and performed in Cura\u00e7ao and the toured in Colombia, Panama, New York and Mexico before settling in Mexico City in 1940. After unsuccessfully trying to restart her business in Mexico, Hern\u00e1ndez returned to New York City and in 1941, moved into the Manhanset Building at 786 Prospect Avenue in The Bronx. She opened another music store on the ground floor of the building, known as Casa de M\u00fasica (House of Music). As before, her brother Rafael was listed as one of the owners, however, he remained in Mexico City through the 1940s and Victoria ran the business. She sold instruments, records and sheet music, but also carried men's suits, women's fashions and hats and gave music lessons for extra income. The variety of items were not uncommon at the time, as exclusive stores specializing in only one product did not emerge until the late part of the 1940s. Hern\u00e1ndez soon renamed the business as Casa Hern\u00e1ndez and operated it until 1965 when Rafael died. Losing interest in the venture upon his death, she hired Johnny Cab\u00e1n to manage the store for the next four years. In 1969 Hern\u00e1ndez sold the store to Miguel Angel \"Mike\" Amadeo. He renamed the store Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hern\u00e1ndez, retaining the historic ties to the Hern\u00e1ndez siblings. Still in operation, the store has the longest record of continuous operation of any music store in New York City. After she sold the store, Hern\u00e1ndez became the companion of Gabriel Oller, another music entrepreneur who owned the second Puerto Rican music store opened in New York, the Spanish Music Center. Hern\u00e1ndez remained in Manhattan until the 1980s. ==Death and legacy== Hern\u00e1ndez died on April 11, 1998 in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico and was buried in Rafael's tomb in the Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan. Hern\u00e1ndez's career is evidence of the ways in which women in her era took on both traditional roles as caretakers but managed to live in nontraditional ways by becoming involved in business. ==See also== * List of Puerto Ricans *History of women in Puerto Rico ==Notes== == References == ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * Category:1897 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Burials at Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery Category:Puerto Rican women Category:People from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican women in business Category:African-American businesspeople Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:American women record producers ",
