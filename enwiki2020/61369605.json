Historian Ulrike Thoms has noted that \"its membership actively sought to influence the population through the dissemination of magazines, tracts, pamphlets, and public lectures, so the society was more publicly present than the small official membership lists suggest.\" Elis\u00e9e Reclus' essay Le Vegetarisme (On Vegetarianism) was published in La Reforme Alimentaire, 1901.Clark, John P; Martin Camille.
