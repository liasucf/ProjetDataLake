    "text": "This article shows the U.S. Census totals for Aroostook County, Maine, broken down by municipality, from 1900 to 2000. There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Aroostook County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be \u201corganized\u201d, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Aroostook County also contains a very small amount of territory that is under the jurisdiction of an Indian reservation, which is considered to be a distinct entity independent from any municipality. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Aroostook County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations and unorganized entities, should yield the county total. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town. ==Corporate changes since 1900== *1901 \u2013 Crystal Plantation incorporated as a town *1903 \u2013 Castle Hill Plantation incorporated as a town *1905 \u2013 Westfield Plantation incorporated as a town *1909 \u2013 Portage Lake Plantation incorporated as a town *1911 \u2013 Eagle Lake, Merrill and Stockholm Plantations incorporated as towns *1913 \u2013 Connor and Wade Plantations incorporated as towns *1915 \u2013 Chapman Plantation incorporated as a town *1940 \u2013 Presque Isle became a city *1945 \u2013 Connor disincorporated and reverted to unorganized territory *1966 \u2013 Allagash Plantation incorporated as a town *1967 \u2013 St. Francis Plantation incorporated as a town *1968 \u2013 Caribou became a city *1976 \u2013 Hamlin and New Canada Plantations incorporated as towns.

A small portion of Aroostook County was also reported as being within an Indian reservation, but it had no population. ==Plantations== As of 1900, Aroostook County contained 32 plantations. Eleven of these remain today. The disposition of the other 21 is as follows: *18 of the plantations that existed in 1900 incorporated as towns over the course of the 20th century. Ten did so between 1900 and 1915, while a further eight did so between the 1960s and 1980s. The former group includes one municipality (Conner) which later disincorporated and reverted to unorganized territory. *Sheridan Plantation was annexed by the town of Ashland in 1901. *Sliver Ridge Plantation surrendered its organization in 1941 and reverted to unorganized territory. *E Plantation surrendered its organization in 1990 and reverted to unorganized territory. Winterville Plantation changed its name to Hill in 1903, but changed it back to Winterville in 1907, without ever having been reported in a decennial census under the name Hill. 1900 *Wallagrass 784 *Hamlin 574 *St. Francis 568 *Castle Hill 567 *Cyr 502 *Connor 453 *Sheridan 433 *New Canada 419 *Eagle Lake 406 *Cary 400 *Reed 399 *St. John 371 *Crystal 370 *Caswell 368 *Merrill 298 *Chapman 285 *Wade 271 *Westfield 259 *Portage Lake 241 *Moro 217 *Stockholm 191 *Allagash 190 *Glenwood 178 *Silver Ridge 168 *Macwahoc 153 *Oxbow 153 *Winterville 124 *Hammond 116 *Garfield 111 *Westmanland 100 *E 44 *Nashville 32 1910 *Eagle Lake 1,421 *Wallagrass 1,004 *St. Francis 918 *Stockholm 715 *Hamlin 657 *Connor 609 *New Canada 590 *St. John 571 *Reed 537 *Cyr 531 *Caswell 529 *Chapman 426 *Merrill 393 *Cary 340 *Wade 318 *Winterville 267 *Allagash 245 *Moro 215 *Oxbow 181 *Silver Ridge 155 *Macwahoc 147 *Glenwood 128 *E 126 *Garfield 121 *Hammond 115 *Westmanland 104 *Nashville 27 1920 *St. Francis 1,241 *Wallagrass 1,144 *Reed 639 *Hamlin 602 *New Canada 573 *Caswell 558 *St. John 549 *Cyr 479 *Allagash 359 *Winterville 353 *Cary 327 *Oxbow 198 *Moro 181 *Silver Ridge 164 *Garfield 142 *Hammond 132 *Macwahoc 131 *Westmanland 101 *E 97 *Glenwood 87 *Nashville 39 1930 *St. Francis 1,367 *Wallagrass 1,145 *Caswell 642 *St. John 569 *New Canada 538 *Cyr 521 *Reed 495 *Hamlin 486 *Allagash 438 *Winterville 408 *Cary 241 *Silver Ridge 186 *Oxbow 176 *Moro 169 *Macwahoc 163 *E 97 *Hammond 95 *Garfield 91 *Westmanland 87 *Glenwood 77 *Nashville 32 1940 *St. Francis 1,489 *Wallagrass 1,123 *Caswell 650 *Allagash 644 *Hamlin 638 *New Canada 633 *St. John 628 *Winterville 462 *Cyr 433 *Reed 433 *Cary 287 *Macwahoc 242 *Oxbow 178 *Silver Ridge 160 *Moro 130 *Hammond 108 *Westmanland 105 *Garfield 97 *E 79 *Glenwood 75 *Nashville 36 1950 *St. Francis 1,384 *Wallagrass 1,035 *Caswell 687 *Allagash 680 *St. John 569 *New Canada 444 *Hamlin 430 *Winterville 373 *Reed 351 *Cary 278 *Cyr 256 *Oxbow 189 *Macwahoc 131 *Hammond 120 *Garfield 116 *Moro 84 *Westmanland 77 *Glenwood 53 *E 30 *Nashville 28 1960 *St. Francis 1,058 *Caswell 853 *Wallagrass 818 *Allagash 557 *St. John 407 *Hamlin 374 *Reed 325 *New Canada 288 *Cyr 233 *Winterville 215 *Cary 208 *Macwahoc 165 *Oxbow 137 *Hammond 94 *Garfield 89 *Moro 49 *Westmanland 46 *Glenwood 30 *Nashville 30 *E 9 1970 *Caswell 693 *Wallagrass 617 *St. John 377 *Hamlin 357 *New Canada 300 *Reed 273 *Cary 184 *Winterville 164 *Cyr 155 *Macwahoc 126 *Garfield 104 *Oxbow 92 *Hammond 73 *Westmanland 52 *Nashville 50 *Moro 24 *E 18 *Glenwood 9 1980 *Wallagrass 653 *Caswell 586 *St. John 322 *Reed 274 *Winterville 235 *Cary 229 *Cyr 147 *Macwahoc 126 *Garfield 107 *Oxbow 84 *Hammond 73 *E 55 *Nashville 48 *Moro 30 *Glenwood 7 1990 *Reed 296 *St. John 274 *Cary 235 *Winterville 217 *Cyr 142 *Macwahoc 114 *Garfield 102 *Oxbow 69 *E 64 *Nashville 43 *Moro 38 *Glenwood 8 2000 *St. John 282 *Cary 217 *Reed 207 *Winterville 196 *Cyr 117 *Macwahoc 98 *Garfield 86 *Moro 63 *Oxbow 56 *Nashville 55 *Glenwood 0 ==Unorganized Territory== Like all of Maine's interior and northern counties, Aroostook County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. The extent of this territory is far greater in Aroostook County than in any other Maine County. Organized municipalities have existed only in the eastern and northeastern parts of the county, generally in lower-lying areas with access to lakes and rivers (e.g., the valleys of the St. Croix River and its tributaries). The remainder of the county to the west, much of which is quite mountainous and remote, has been left unorganized. Most of this area has historically been very sparsely populated. The bulk of the population that does live in unorganized areas lives close to the areas of the county that are organized. Historically, only about 40% the county\u2019s land area was incorporated or organized, leaving the remainder unorganized. There are more than a hundred townships in the county which have never been organized, and a number of others which have never advanced beyond the plantation stage. Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. In Aroostook County, this included one community which had been a town (Connor) and one which had not advanced beyond the plantation stage (Silver Ridge). In more recent decades, Aroostook County has lost two additional municipalities. In 1987, the town of Benedicta disincorporated, and in 1990, E Plantation dissolved. Both reverted to unorganized territory. The areas of Aroostook County that are entirely unorganized cover about 4,000 square miles, with a population of about 1,650. This covers just under 60% of the county\u2019s land area, but includes only about 2.2% of its population. Five unorganized townships have large enough populations to maintain a registrar and clerk to conduct elections for state and federal offices, although they do not have true organized municipal governments: Benedicta, Connor, Cross Lake, Madawaska Lake and Sinclair. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all \u201cUnorganized Territory\u201d listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more \u201cunorganized territories\u201d. As of the 2000 Census, five such areas are recognized within Hancock County: *South Aroostook Unorganized Territory: a group of approximately 12 contiguous unorganized townships in the southeastern part of the county. It is entirely bordered by organized municipalities and the Penobscot County line. Includes the former town of Benedicta and the former Silver Ridge Plantation. *Central Aroostook Unorganized territory: a group of approximately 15 contiguous unorganized townships in the east central part of the county. It is entirely surrounded by organized municipalities and the Penobscot County line. (There are two rows of organized municipalities in between South Aroostook and Central Aroostook.) Includes the former E Plantation. *Square Lake Unorganized Territory: a group of approximately 10 contiguous unorganized townships in the northeastern part of the county. It is entirely surrounded by organized municipalities except for a short stretch on its southwest in between Portage Lake and Winterville Plantation, across T14R6. Square Lake Unorganized Territory and Northwest Aroostook Unorganized Territory are continuous across T14R6, but the Census Bureau divides them at a line that runs through the township. As a result of this, for census purposes T14R6 is partially in Square Lake Unorganized Territory and partially in Northwest Aroostook Unorganized Territory. *Northwest Aroostook Unorganized Territory: a group of approximately 70 contiguous unorganized townships, covering most of the western part of the county. This territory includes about two-thirds of the unorganized territory in the county, and covers nearly 40% of the county\u2019s total land area. Most of this area is essentially uninhabited, however. Northwest Aroostook Unorganized Territory and Square Lake Unorganized Territory are continuous across T14R6, but the Census Bureau divides them Bureau divides them at a line that runs through the township. As a result of this, for census purposes T14R6 is partially in Square Lake Unorganized Territory and partially in Northwest Aroostook Unorganized Territory. *Connor Unorganized Territory: the former town of Connor, which is its own unorganized territory because it does not border any other land that is unorganized. When the Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census, there were four in Aroostook County. Central Aroostook, South Aroostook and Connor were similar to their present-day state. The fourth, North Aroostook, consisted of what is now both Northwest Aroostook and Square Lake. North Aroostook was divided into the current configuration for the 1980 Census, apparently in recognition of the fact that the areas represented by the two resulting territories are barely contiguous, and that there is a significant difference in population density between them. The former town of Benedicta was added to South Aroostook for the 1990 Census, and the former E Plantation was added to Central Aroostook for the 2000 census, following their dissolution as municipalities. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 10,592 Organized plantations 9,745 Unorganized territory 847 *Guerrette Twp.

As its name suggests, the baseline for this grid is the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, along Aroostook County\u2019s eastern edge. In places, it has up to 20 numbered rows, arranged from north to south, and up to 17 numbered ranges, arranged from east to west. A row \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d also exist in some areas to the south of row 1. Some townships in the southeastern part of the grid do not line up precisely with the townships to their west, and were assigned range letters rather than numbers; some such townships in range two remain unorganized (e.g., TDR2; the former E Plantation was originally TER2). Many of the WELS townships in Aroostook County are identified only by their row and range numbers and have never developed informal township names. All of the original townships in the first range are presently organized. The second through sixth ranges contain a mixture of organized and unorganized territory. The seventh through eleventh ranges only contain organized territory in the last few rows to the north, near the Saint John River, but are otherwise unorganized. No territory in Aroostook County in any range beyond the eleventh has ever been organized. In 2005, the Maine state legislature officially changed the name of Guerette Township (T2R6) to Cross Lake Township, and officially named T11R14, which had not previously had a generally used name, as Clayton Lake Township. ==Indian Reservations== Maine contains three federally recognized Indian reservations. One of these, the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, includes a very small amount of territory in Aroostook County. Maine currently treats Indian reservations as distinct entities, not part of any organized municipality or unorganized entity. This has not always been the case in the past; at one time, present-day reservation land was regarded as part of the municipalities or unorganized entities within which it is geographically located. The main body of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation is adjacent to the Penobscot River at Old Town, in Penobscot County. The reservation also has jurisdiction over the channel of the Penobscot River for some distance to the north. For a short distance near Aroostook County\u2019s southwest corner, the Penobscot River forms the boundary between Penobscot and Aroostook counties. A very small portion of river channel at this location, under the jurisdiction of the reservation, lies within Aroostook County. The portion of the reservation that extends into Aroostook County measures less than a quarter of a square mile. It is unclear how long the river channel has been considered part of the reservation. The Penobscot Indian Island Reservation has been considered a distinct entity since the 1950 Census, but the portion of the reservation within Aroostook County first appeared in the 2000 Census. The portion within Aroostook County is entirely water (not land) and did not report any population in the 2000 Census. ==Notes== 1960 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1960 census totals subsequent to their initial release. When it did so, however, it appears to have updated municipal totals only, not overall county totals or state totals, even though in most cases changing municipal totals should have caused county and state totals to change. The 1960 total for Aroostook County was originally reported as 106,064; and for the town of Stockholm, 649. The total for Stockholm was later revised to that shown in the list above (492). This should have caused the county total to change as well (to 105,907), but subsequent census publications have continued to list the county total as it was originally reported (106,064). As a result, in the list above, the municipal totals for 1960 do not add to the county total. The 1960 state total for Maine that appears in various Census materials (969,265) likewise reflects the original 1960 total for Aroostook County, and does not take into account the revision made to the population of Stockholm. 1970 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1970 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 1970 total for Aroostook County was originally reported as 92,463, and for the town of Limestone, 8,745. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. 1980 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1980 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 1980 total for Aroostook County was originally reported as 91,331, and for the town of Ashland, 1,865. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. The 1970 Census reports show Westmanland as a plantation, changing to a town for the 1980 Census. No date or explanation is provided. The author of this article has been unable to locate any source with a date of incorporation for Westmanland. Until information to the contrary is discovered, this article assumes that Westmanland became a town between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. 1990 Census The 1980 Census reports show Hammond as a plantation, changing to a town for the 1990 Census. No date or explanation is provided. The author of this article has been unable to locate any source with a date of incorporation for Hammond. Until information to the contrary is discovered, this article assumes that Hammond became a town between the 1980 and 1990 censuses. The 1990 Census reports show Wallagrass as a plantation, changing to a town for the 2000 Census. The 2000 Census reports state that Wallagrass \u201cchanged legal description from plantation to a town\u201d, but no date is provided. The author of this article was able to locate two sources containing a year of incorporation for Wallagrass, one of which indicated 1979, and one of which indicated 1986. It is possible that the 1979 date could refer to a legislative act which was not effective until 1980. It is also possible that the note in the 1990 Census reports is referring to a change which took place before 1990 but was missed in the 1990 reports. Until information to the contrary is discovered, this article assumes the most likely scenario is that Wallagrass became a town between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, and that it was shown as a plantation in 1990 in error. ==See also== *United States Census *Aroostook County, Maine Category:Aroostook County, Maine Category:Demographics of Maine ",
