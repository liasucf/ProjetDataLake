It formerly played in the Gulf Coast Premier League. == History == ===Founding=== AFC Mobile was founded in 2015 by Mobile and Baldwin County, Alabama, soccer enthusiasts in order to establish a semi-professional soccer team in the City of Mobile. It was announced on January 3, 2017, that AFC Mobile would join the Gulf Coast Premier League for its inaugural Summer Season. On November 12, 2019, it was announced that AFC Mobile would join the National Premier Soccer League in a newly formed Gulf Coast Conference that featured Mobile, Port City FC, Tallahassee SC, Pensacola FC, and NPSL mainstays the New Orleans Jesters and Jacksonville Armada. ===Inaugural season=== Prior to their debut season, AFC Mobile announced that it would play its inaugural season's home games at the Archbishop Lipscomb Athletic Complex located in the Bolton neighborhood of Mobile. For its first two years, the team was managed by Nate Nicholas, a former player for the University of Mobile, former back-to-back state championship-winning coach at UMS-Wright Preparatory School, and current varsity men's coach at McGill\u2013Toolen Catholic High School. ===Changes to coaching staff=== After finishing the 2018 GCPL season, head coach Nate Nicholas stepped down. Ultimately Spring Hill College's men's soccer coach Steve Wieczorek was named as Nicholas's replacement on January 7, 2019. == Attendance == For their debut game on May 14, 2017, AFC Mobile more than quadrupled the highest ever attendance for the Gulf Coast Premier League. In their second home game on June 10, 2017 against Biloxi City FC, AFC Mobile drew 924 to Archbishop Lipscomb Stadium, which topped the league's previous record. On June 8th, 2017, AFC Mobile became the first team in the Gulf Coast Premier League to break 1,000 people in attendance against CD Motagua of New Orleans. During their second season, AFC Mobile would go on to draw over 1,400 fans twice against the Gulf Coast Rangers and Port City FC. ==Players and staff== ===2019 roster=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|No. ! style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Position ! style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Player ! style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Nation |- |} Source: === Team management === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;\" scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Coaching Staff |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Year-by-year== {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Year !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Conference !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|League !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Regular Season !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Playoffs !style=\"background:#800000; color:white; border:2px solid #FFFF00;;\" scope=\"col\"|Open Cup |- |2017 |Eastern Conference |GCPL |6th, East |Did not qualify |Did not enter |- |2018 |Eastern Conference |GCPL |4th, East |Did not qualify |Did not enter |- |- |2019 |Eastern Conference |GCPL |2nd, East |Quarterfinals |Did not enter |- |2020 |Gulf Coast Conference |NPSL | | | |- |} == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Sports in Mobile, Alabama Category:2015 establishments in Alabama Category:Association football clubs established in 2015 Category:Soccer clubs in Alabama ",
