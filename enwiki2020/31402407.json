Maek began his career with BFC Dynamo, making his debut in 1983 at a time when the club were dominating football in East Germany. He played for the first team for four years, winning the league title on each occasion, but was not able to make a regular impact, making only 37 league appearances. In 1987, he left BFC Dynamo to join its rivals, 1. FC Union Berlin, where he spent seven and a half years, playing in the DDR- Oberliga, the DDR-Liga, and, after German reunification, in the NOFV-Oberliga. His career at Union Berlin came to an end in October 1994, when he received a six-year ban for violent conduct against a referee. After appeal this was commuted to just one month, and Maek resumed his career with Union 06 Berlin. In the summer of 1995, Maek returned to BFC Dynamo, now named FC Berlin, eventually retiring from the game in 2000, by which time the club had reverted to its traditionalal name.
