    "text": "Taoyuan (pictured above; 2.3 million) is the satellite city of Taipei (7 million). Many of the former's residents work in and commute to the latter. Satellite cities or satellite towns are smaller municipalities that are adjacent to a major city which is the core of a metropolitan area. They differ from mere suburbs, subdivisions and especially bedroom communities in that they have municipal governments distinct from that of the core metropolis and employment bases sufficient to support their residential populations. Conceptually, satellite cities could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. However, functioning as part of a metropolis, a satellite city experiences cross-commuting (that is, residents commuting out of and employees commuting into the city). ==Satellite cities versus other types of settlement== Satellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development. ===Suburbs=== Satellite cities differ from suburbs in that they have distinct employment bases, commutersheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not bedroom communities. ===Edge cities=== Satellite cities differ from edge cities, which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic downtown, a distinct independent municipal government, existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city. Conceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge city could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas, but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves. Some satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the uptown variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous. ===Multi-polar cities=== In some cases large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as twin cities. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in such cases : *satellites are clearly much less important than the larger center around which they are located, while the various nodes of multi- polar cities are close to each other in importance *satellites are separated from the larger center by a substantial belt of rural territory, while twin cities may be fully integrated in physical form For example, Fort Worth, Texas is a twin of Dallas, Texas because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite. However, Waco, Texas is a satellite town of both cities. Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same urbanized area should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other. ===Metropolitan areas=== Conceptually, satellite cities are miniature metro areas on the fringe of larger ones. Satellite cities are sometimes listed as part of the larger metro area, and sometimes listed as totally independent. In the United States, satellite cities are often (but not always) listed as independent Metropolitan Statistical Areas within a single Combined Statistical Area that is unified with the larger metropolis. ==Examples== ===Argentina=== *Campana, Buenos Aires Province (satellite of Buenos Aires) *La Plata (satellite of Buenos Aires) *Lujan, Buenos Aires Province (satellite of Buenos Aires) ===Australia=== *Central Coast (satellite of Sydney) *Gold Coast (satellite of Brisbane) *Gawler, South Australia (satellite of Adelaide) *Mandurah, Western Australia (satellite of Perth) *Melton, Victoria (satellite of Melbourne) *Palmerston, Northern Territory (satellite of Darwin) *Pakenham, Victoria (satellite of Melbourne) *Sunbury, Victoria (satellite of Melbourne) *Sunshine Coast (satellite of Brisbane) *Toowoomba (satellite of Brisbane) *Wollongong (satellite of Sydney) *Werribee, Victoria (satellite of Melbourne) *Queanbeyan, New South Wales (satellite of Canberra) ===Bangladesh=== *Purbachal New Town (satellite of Dhaka) *Uttara Model Town (3rd Phase) (satellite of Dhaka) ===Belarus=== *Fanipal (satellite of Minsk) *Smalyavichy (satellite of Minsk) *Zhabinka (satellite of Brest) *Skidziel (satellite of Hrodna) ===Brazil=== *Guarulhos (satellite of S\u00e3o Paulo) *Jundia\u00ed (satellite of S\u00e3o Paulo) *Mogi das Cruzes (satellite of S\u00e3o Paulo) *Niter\u00f3i (satellite of Rio de Janeiro) *Olinda (satellite of Recife) *Osasco (satellite of S\u00e3o Paulo) *Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo (satellite of S\u00e3o Paulo) ===Cambodia=== *Camko City (satellite of Phnom Penh) ===Canada=== *Mississauga, Ontario (satellite of Toronto) *Oshawa, Ontario (satellite of Toronto) *Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Joliette, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Sorel-Tracy, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Salaberry-de- Valleyfield, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Abbotsford, British Columbia (satellite of Vancouver) *Laval, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Terrebonne, Quebec (satellite of Montreal) *Gatineau, Quebec (satellite of Ottawa) *Windsor, Ontario (satellite of Detroit) *St. Albert, Alberta (satellite of Edmonton) ===Croatia=== *Velika Gorica (satellite of Zagreb) ===Egypt=== *6th of October City (satellite of Cairo) ===Finland=== *Espoo, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Kauniainen, Kerava and Vantaa (satellites of Helsinki) *Kangasala, Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4, Nokia, Pirkkala and Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi (satellites of Tampere) *Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali and Raisio (satellites of Turku) ===India=== Sec V Office towers, Kolkata, India.
