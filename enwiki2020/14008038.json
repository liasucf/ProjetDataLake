    "text": "{| |} USS Brockenborough (1862) was a sloop captured by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was used by the Union Navy primarily as a ship's tender and also as a gunboat stationed off Confederate ports to prevent their trading with foreign countries. ==Sloop captured and converted to Union Navy service== On October 16, 1862, the commanding officer of the Union steamer \u2014 Acting Lieutenant Edward Y. McCauley \u2014 ordered Acting Master Robert B. Smith to lead a reconnaissance expedition up the Apalachicola River. During the ensuing operation, Smith's boats exchanged fire with Southerners ashore and signaled for help. That gunboat's launch brought a howitzer into the fray, \"\u2026cleared the banks of the guerrillas,\" and enabled the Union boats to continue on upstream. A short distance past the town of Apalachicola, Florida, Smith found a sailing ship which had grounded inside the mouth of a creek. She proved to be G. L. Brockenborough, a sloop carrying 64 bales of cotton. Her master and a single passenger were still on board. The Union sailors refloated the vessel and took her to Key West, Florida, where she was condemned by the prize court and purchased by the Navy on November 15. ==Civil War service== ===Assigned to the East Gulf Blockade as a tender=== Sent back to waters off the Apalachicola, Brockenborough \u2014 also spelled Brockenboro \u2014 served the East Gulf Blockading Squadron as a tender to the double-ended sidewheeler and the former ferryboat . On February 18, 1863, while anchored off New Inlet, St. George's Sound, Somerset sighted a schooner sailing westward along the southern coast of St. George's Island; and her captain \u2014 Lieutenant Commander A. F. Crosman \u2014 sent Brockenborough in pursuit of the stranger. The armed sloop overtook and captured Hortense, a schooner bound from Havana, Cuba, for Mobile, Alabama, with an escorted cargo. Crosman manned the prize from Somerset and sent her to Key West, Florida, for adjudication, and she was condemned by the prize court there. ===Attempting to tow a Confederate boat that had been sunk=== On March 20, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant George E. Welch \u2014 who commanded the Union bark \u2014 sent his executive officer, Acting Master Richard J. Hoffner, in Brockenborough to the mouth of the Ocklocknee River to investigate a report that a schooner was loading cotton at that place. The sloop, accompanied by Amandas launch, struggled across the marshy waters of St. George's Sound for three days before reaching the Ocklocknee where Hoffner found \"\u2026a dismasted vessel lying close to [the river's] starboard bank\u2026.\" While the Union party approached the partially sunken ship, the Southerners who had been on board escaped to shore in boats. Hoffner tried to tow his quarry back toward the sound, but the prize \u2014 the schooner Onward \u2014 was stranded by the ebbing tide some two hours later. ===Attacked by Confederate cavalry, the tow is abandoned=== The next morning, when Onward was again afloat, the expedition once more headed for deep water, but took the wrong channel and again struck the bottom. After strenuously, although futilely, striving to pull free, the Union sailors decided to wait for help from the rising tide. However, a short while later, some 40 mounted Confederate soldiers and about 150 Southern infantrymen arrived and attacked the expedition. Some of the bluejackets fought back with a howitzer and muskets while their companions set fire to the prize before the whole Union party withdrew in Brockenborough and the launch. Both scraped on the bottom but were kept in motion by wading sailors who dragged the boats for about half a mile over mud flats before they floated free. Confederate riflemen kept the party under fire throughout the retreat, killing one man outright and wounding eight others, including Acting Master Hoffner. Once the boats were free of the mud, they proceeded to waters off St. Mark's, Florida, where the wounded were embarked in the Union steamer . ===Brockenborough beached and burned to prevent her capture=== Brockenborough soon returned to St. Georges Sound and, some two months later, was within signal distance of USS Port Royal, when boats from that ship captured the cotton-laden sloop Fashion on 23 May. That night a stiff breeze from the northeast arose and the next day it began to increase steadily in intensity. By the 27th, the wind had reached hurricane intensity and had created a shoreward, current through the West Pass in St. George's Sound, threatening to drive Brockenborough ashore on the mainland where she and her crew would be at the mercy of Confederate forces. On 28 May the sloop was driven ashore by the wind and wrecked on St. George's Island where she was set afire to prevent her being recaptured by the South. ==See also== * United States Navy * American Civil War ==References== Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Gunboats of the United States Navy Category:Sloops of the United States Navy Category:Tenders of the United States Navy Category:American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States Category:American Civil War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the American Civil War ",
