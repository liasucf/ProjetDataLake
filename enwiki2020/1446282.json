    "text": "Mardin Province (, , , ), is a province of Turkey with a population of 809,719 in 2017. The capital of the Mardin Province is Mardin ( \"Mardin\" Arabic: \u0645\u0627\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0646, Mard\u012bn). Located in southeastern Turkey near the traditional geographical boundary of Anatolia and Mesopotamia, it has a diverse population, composed of Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian people, with Kurds forming the majority of the province's population. A recent study from 2013 has shown that 40% of Mardin Province's population identify as Arabs, and this proportion increases to 49% in Mardin and 48% in Midyat, where Arabs form the majority.Ayse Guc Isik, 2013.The Intercultural Engagement in Mardin. Australian Catholic University. pp. 46-48. ==History== Mardin comes from the Syriac word (\u0721\u072a\u0715\u0710) and means \"fortresses\".Payne Smith's A Compendious Syriac Dictionary, Dukhrana.com The first known civilization were the Subarian- Hurrians who were then succeeded in 3000 BCE by the Hurrians. The Elamites gained control around 2230 BCE and were followed by the Babylonians, Hittites, Assyrians, Romans and Byzantines. The local Assyrians/Syriacs, while reduced due to the Assyrian Massacres and conflicts between the Kurds and Turks, hold on to two of the oldest monasteries in the world, Dayro d-Mor Hananyo (Turkish Deyr\u00fclzafaran, English Saffron Monastery) and Deyrulumur Monastery. The Christian community is concentrated on the Tur Abdin plateau and in the town of Midyat, with a smaller community (approximately 200) in the provincial capital. After the foundation of Turkey, the province has been a target of a Turkification policy, removing most traces of a non-turkish heritage.\u00dcng\u00f6r, U\u011fur (2011), The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913\u20131950.
