    "text": "Philadelphia-Montgomery Christian Academy, commonly known as Phil-Mont Christian Academy, is a selective private Christian school serving grades K-12. Phil-Mont was founded in 1943 by Cornelius Van Til and others. Phil- Mont's curriculum is rooted in a christian worldview, the principles of the liberal arts, and the classical education model. == Athletics == thumb Over half of the student body participates on a team each year and several of the school's alumni return to serve their alma mater as coaches. Starting back in the 1960s, Phil-Mont was a member of the Keystone Scholastic Athletic Conference. This was a close- knit league made up of smaller sized private schools within the surrounding counties. During their tenure within the KSAC , Phil-Mont won championships in boys soccer, cross country, basketball, baseball and tennis. Girls championships were achieved in field hockey, tennis, basketball and softball. In 2007, Phil-Mont became a member of the PIAA District One and joined the Bicentennial Athletic League. This new league, comprising both private and public schools, provides strong local competition along with the opportunity for teams as well as individuals to advance into District, Regional and State Championships.http://www.balsports.com/ League and District Championships Since 2007 Soccer (B) '07 -'08, '08 -'09, '09 -'10, '10 -'11 X-Country (B) '07 -'08, '08 -'09 Basketball (B) '10 -'11, '13 -'14, '15 -'16 Basketball (G) '13 -'14, '14 -'15, '15 -'16 == Fine Arts == === Art === thumb Art class at Phil- Mont runs from Kindergarten through 12th grade, and includes AP Advanced Placement Art. === Drama === thumb Phil-Mont hosts 4 stage performances a year, including a Fall Musical*, Winter Play**, Night of One Acts** and a Spring Fine Arts Festival*. *Middle and High School combined **High School only === Music === Music is taught at Phil-Mont at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Elementary K-5th Grade !Middle School 6th-12th Grade !High School 9th-12th Grade |- |Instruments |Core* |Core* Other** |Core* Other** |- |Lessons |Yes |Yes |Independent Study |- |Classes |ES Band |MS Band |HS Band |- |Electives |None |Jazz Band MS Worship Team |Jazz Band HS Worship Team |- |Concerts |Christmas Spring |Christmas Spring ACSI Arts Festival |Christmas Spring ACSI Arts Festival |} *Core Instruments: Clarinet, Flute, French Horn, Saxophone, Trumpet, Trombone, Percussion **Other Instruments:Baritone Horn, Tuba, Saxophone == History == In 1939, Dr. Cornelius Van Til gave a series of lectures at Calvary Pres. in Willow Grove, regarding the responsibility of Christian parents to train their children apart from the state schools. He was instrumental in leading a small group of families to start the Christian School Society of Willow Grove. In September 1943, the first classes of the Willow Grove Christian Day School began with 1 teacher and 17 students in three elementary classes. The school met in the basement of Calvary Presbyterian Church in Willow Grove. The school grew to K \u2013 8 by 1955. In 1956 the Philadelphia-Montgomery Christian High School began with 3 teachers and 34 ninth and tenth graders. The students met at the First Reformed Church of Germantown until the newly acquired Wyncote Elementary building was fixed up in preparation for grades 9-12. In 1964\u201365, the elementary and high schools merged, becoming Philadelphia-Montgomery Christian Academy. In 1969 a new school facility, to house grades K\u201312, was built on a 20-acre site in nearby Dresher. In 1979 the former Hillcrest Junior High School was purchased to house the middle and high schools (6\u201312). In 2006\u201307, the elementary, middle and high schools merged on the Hillcrest campus. == Press == In 2012, Philadelphia Magazine included Phil-Mont Christian Academy in their list, \"Guide to (45) Great Private Schools\" which ranks \"the region\u2019s best performers.\" In 2017, nich.com ranked Phil-Mont #6 (out of 113) of Pennsylvania's most diverse private high schools, ranked Phil- Mont #14 (out of 55) of Pennsylvania's best Christian high schools, and ranked Phil-Mont #46 (out of 158) of Pennsylvania's best private high schools == Notable alumni == * Christian Smith - American Sociologist, and the William R.
