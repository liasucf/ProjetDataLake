    "text": "\"Out of Touch\" is a song by American duo Hall & Oates from their twelfth studio album Big Bam Boom (1984). The song was released as the lead single from Big Bam Boom on October 4, 1984, by RCA Records. This song was their last Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, topping the chart for two weeks in December 1984. It also became the duo's fourteenth consecutive top 40 hit since 1980. The song often segued from \"Dance on Your Knees\", which is the opening song of the Big Bam Boom album. The accompanying music video for \"Out of Touch\", featuring a gigantic drum kit, also contains the \"Dance on Your Knees\" intro, which segues into an edit of the 12-inch remix version. According to John Oates, he came up with the chorus while randomly playing around with a synthesizer that he did not know how to use. He thought it could be a song for The Stylistics, having a Philly sound. But in the studio the next day a co-producer told him it should be a hit for Hall & Oates themselves. Oates and Hall then co-wrote the verse. ==Track listing and formats== US 7-inch vinyl single # \"Out of Touch\" \u2014 3:55 # \"Cold, Dark and Yesterday\" \u2014 4:35 US 12-inch vinyl single # \"Out of Touch\" (Remix) \u2014 7:36 # \"Out of Touch\" (Dub Version) \u2014 7:24 # \"Cold, Dark and Yesterday\" \u2014 4:35 UK 12-inch vinyl single # \"Out of Touch\" (Video Mix) # \"Dance on Your Knees\" (Extended Mix) # \"Everytime You Go Away\" (Remix Version) ==Credits== *Daryl Hall \u2013 lead vocals and backing vocals, rhythm guitar *John Oates \u2013 synthesizers and backing vocals *G.
