In 2001 the leaseholder was Peter Camm who was blocked from buying Moola Boola and Mount Amhurst Stations buy the then planning minister Alannah MacTiernan. The block resulted from cattle stealing charges that had been brought against Camm three years earlier. The family of Jill Jenyns placed the property on the market following her death in a helicopter crash in 2011. The property was expected to fetch 15 million and was stocked with approximately 15,000 head of cattle. It sold later the same year for 18 million to the Bunuba Cattle Company, an Indigenous group, with the Australian Agricultural Company expected to manage the operations. As of 2014 the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pastoral leases in Western Australia Category:Kimberley (Western Australia) ",
