For the next 40 years, dozens of Polish migrants arrived and settled in Australia.History of Polish immigration to Australia In the early 1900s, diplomatic relations between Australia and Poland were conducted via-London when Australia was part of the British Empire. Soon after the end of World War I, newly independent Poland established a consulate in Sydney in 1919 and a consulate in Melbourne in 1931. Both consulates, however, were closed immediately after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. During the war, both Australian and Polish troops fought together in the Italian Campaign, especially during the Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war, Poland re-emerged with different borders than it had prior to the war and established a communist system of government. From 1947\u20131966, over 61,000 Polish migrants immigrated to Australia. Many of the Polish migrants were veterans, displaced persons, survivors of labour and concentration camps, prisoner-of-war camps or immigration detention camps. In February 1972, Australia and Poland officially established diplomatic relations. That same year, Poland opened an embassy in Canberra. Australia opened an embassy in Warsaw in September 1973. Throughout the 1980s, Poland experienced the Solidarity (\"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\") movement which eventually contributed to the fall of communism in the country.
