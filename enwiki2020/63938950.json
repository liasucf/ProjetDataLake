He also worked for The Detroit Free Press, Newsweek, and The Wall Street Journal. He taught at Johns Hopkins University, among other institutions. ==Books== Shogan wrote many works of historical nonfiction and media criticism.

Kirkus Reviews called it \"a stunning re-creation of the great West Virginia uprising of 1921 . . . crackingly told.\" The Journal of Appalachian Studies declared that \"among other successes, this book presents a valuable short history of the U.S. labor movement and its discontents through crystalline evocations of figures like Samuel Gompers, John L. Lewis, the Wobblies, and Mother Jones.\" Greil Marcus, in a revised edition of The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes, cited it as a worthy source about the Battle of Blair Mountain. Publishers Weekly wrote that Bad News: Where the Press Goes Wrong in the Making of the President, published in 2001, was a \"carefully crafted retrospective on the media and presidential campaigns since JFK . . . a highly readable chronicle.\" Reviewing 1991's The Riddle of Power: Presidential Leadership From Truman to Bush, The New York Times stated that it was \"on balance . . . a lively and straightforward primer on leadership.\" ==Selected bibliography== *The Detroit Race Riot: A Study in Violence, with Tom Craig (1964) *A Question of Judgment: The Fortas Case and the Struggle for the Supreme Court (1972) *Promises to Keep: Carter's First Hundred Days (1977) *Riddle of Power: Presidential Leadership from Truman to Bush (1991) *Hard Bargain: How FDR Twisted Churchill's Arm, Evaded the Law, and Changed the Role of the American Presidency (1995) *Bad News: Where the Press Goes Wrong in the Making of the President (2001) *The Battle Of Blair Mountain: The Story Of America's Largest Labor Uprising (2004) *No Sense of Decency: The Army- McCarthy Hearings: A Demagogue Falls and Television Takes Charge of American Politics (2009) *Prelude to Catastrophe: FDR's Jews and the Menace of Nazism (2010) *Harry Truman and the Struggle for Racial Justice (2013) ==References== ==External links== * Category:American journalists Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:1930 births Category:2013 deaths ",
