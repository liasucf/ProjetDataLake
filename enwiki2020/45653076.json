He finished primary school in his native village and then went on to study at the Serbian high school in Thessaloniki where he graduated in 1906. In the next five years he was a teacher in Serb schools in Treson\u010de, Dolno Melni\u010dani and Gali\u010dnik. As a holder of a scholarship from the Saint Sava Society in 1911 he started his studies at the Philosophical Faculty in Belgrade.\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0410\u041d\u0423, \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, 2009, \u0441. 1384. == Military career == At the start of the First Balkans War, Smiljani\u0107 left the faculty to join the volunteer unit of Vojvoda Vuk in which he remained for the next four years, fighting with distinction in several battles. After the retreat of the Serbian army to Corfu as a promising student he was sent off to Clermont- Ferrand, France where he studied and graduated geography and history. He fought in April War of 1941 and spent the rest of the occupation as a teacher in Aleksinac. == Work == In 1920 he returned and started working as a professor in the grammar school in Tetovo (1920-1921) and Skopje (1921-1927) and then in Skopje's Trade Academy (1927-1930). From 1924 to 1929 he was the editor of Biblioteka Makedonija in Skopje, which he founded (renamed in 1929 to Starovremska biblioteka). He then went once again to France to finish his doctoral studies and obtained his PhD in 1931. Between 1931 and 1934 he was an MP for Gali\u010dnik-Debar county and after that an inspector (1935-1939) and head of the Educational board of Vardar Banate in Skopje. After his retirement in 1946 he moved to Belgrade.
