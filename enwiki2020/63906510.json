    "text": "Below is a list of covered bridges in Iowa. There are nine authentic covered bridges in the U.S. state of Iowa, though two halves of one bridge reside in different locations. Six of them are historic. A covered bridge is considered authentic not due to its age, but by its construction. An authentic bridge is constructed using trusses rather than other methods such as stringers, a popular choice for non-authentic covered bridges. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
