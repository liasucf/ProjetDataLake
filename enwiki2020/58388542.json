Bell (1888\u20131974) of Wrington was one of the first anglers to adopt an imitative approach to fly fishing on reservoirs in the early twentieth century.Advanced Stillwater Flyfishing by Chris Ogbourne, David & Charles (1993) Page 160. At a time when employing flashy \u2018attractor\u2019 patterns was the norm he employed the alternative tactic of using artificial flies that represented the shape and form of the creatures present in Blagdon Water where he fished regularly. Conrad Voss Bark, BBC political correspondent and angling historian, had these words to say about him, \"Dr Bell of Blagdon had the greatest formative influence of any man on the development of reservoir fishing in the first half of this century\".The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 31 Howard Alexander Bell was born at Bletchingley, near Reigate, Surrey and studied to become a General Practitioner at Cambridge and St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London. He was enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps and served abroad in Flanders and Palestine in World War I.The Field magazine, Article by J K B Crawford (6 February 1975 issue) page 211 He was a shy, sensitive and reserved individual and the horrors of war affected him deeply. He was one of the few who survived the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) in 1917. The emotional scars of what he had witnessed as he tended the wounded and dying in Flanders were to remain with him for the rest of his life. It could well be that his wartime experiences led to his desire to live in idyllic surroundings and pursue the gentle art of fly fishing with such single-minded dedication.A History of Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (paperback edition 1994) page 120 A biography entitled Dr Bell of Wrington: Pioneer of Reservoir Fly Fishing written by Adrian Freer was published in 2019.Dr Bell of Wrington: Pioneer of Reservoir Fly Fishing by Adrian V W Freer, Welford Court Press (2019)222x222px ==Contribution to reservoir fly fishing== Bell was a bank angler and, as far as is recorded, he never fished from a boat. In its formative years Blagdon anglers would normally employ large sea trout or low water salmon flies during the daytime, very often using tandem and multi-hook arrangements; or alternatively lures at night. Dr Bell would use neither, but instead he preferred to fish with his own small imitative patterns.The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) Bell made it his practice to spoon all the trout he caught and after examining the contents he made an index of all the food available to the trout. Following on from that he devised imitations of all the creatures present and the local Blagdon anglers quickly followed his exampleThe Flyfishers\u2019 Journal, Article by Alick Newsom (summer 1975 issue) page 112 A fishing friend of Bell\u2019s, Alick Newsom, described his method of fishing as follows: > He liked to fish alone, always on the move, slowly covering sunken ditches, > holes and weed beds as he sought to locate the trout. > > Bell would always go off on his own, trying to avoid other rods. He had a > pear-shaped landing net slung over his shoulder on a cord. He always fished > from the bank with three unweighted flies on a gut cast, size 1X. He liked > to fish over sunk ditches and holes and weed beds. He moved slowly along the > bank, casting as he went. He cast out as far as was comfortable. He made no > attempt to go for distance but let the flies sink slowly, judging the time > so that the tail fly did not get snagged on the bottom. He used the knot at > the end of his greased silk line as a bite indicator. When the flies were > fully sunk he would gather them in slowly. > > His flies were quite small, 10s, 12s, sometimes 14s. He might have a Worm > Fly on a single hook on the point, a Grenadier on the middle dropper and a > Buzzer on the top. All his dressings were plain and simple\".A History of > Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (1992) chapter 15: Bell's > Bugs ==Fly patterns designed by Dr Bell== Reservoir nymph patterns devised by Dr Bell Dr Bell has several reservoir nymph patterns to his credit: the Grenadier (bloodworm)Tying and Fishing the Nymph by Taff Price, Blandford a Cassell imprint (1995) page 192, Amber Nymph (sedge pupa)Fly-Dressing II by David J Collyer, David & Charles (1981) page 109, Blagdon Buzzer (midge pupa)Tying and Fishing the Nymph by Taff Price, Blandford a Cassell imprint (1995) page 29/30, and CorixaReservoir and Lake Flies by John Veniard, A & C Black (1970) page 53; derivatives of which are still in use on reservoirs almost one hundred years after their creationTrout & Salmon magazine, Article by Lt Col. Esmond Drury (February 1975 issue) page 50. Among his lesser-known patterns are the Blagdon Green MidgeA Further Guide to Fly Dressing by John Veniard, A & C Black (1964) page 123 which he may have devised with the assistance of others, Green & Orange NymphReservoir Trout Flies by Adrian V W Freer, Crowood Press (2010) page 91, Translucent NymphFlyFishing & FlyTying magazine (February 2015 issue) page 43 and Bloodworm Nymph. Recent research (in 2018) has led to the publication of a number of previously undocumented flies designed by Dr Bell including the Stickle FryFlydresser magazine (Spring 2020 issue) page 18, Green & Yellow Damsel Nymph Flydresser magazine (Summer 2020 issue) page 10 and several other patterns. A book documenting all Dr Bell's fly patterns of which there is a record entitled Dr Bell's Trout Flies: The Stillwater Nymph Patterns of Dr Bell written by Adrian V W Freer was published in 2020.Dr Bell\u2019s Trout Flies: The Stillwater Nymph Patterns of Dr Bell of Wrington, Coch-y-Bonddu Books Angling Monographs Series Volume Twelve (2020) Regrettably, being the reclusive person that he was, many of his other patterns have been lost in the mists of time.Flydresser magazine (Spring 2019 issue) page 7 ==Later years and death== Dr Bell eventually retired from medical practice in 1963 and carried on fishing for a few more years until, as a result of advancing age, he was unable to continueThe Field magazine, Article by J K B Crawford (6 February 1975 issue) page 211. He died on 2 December 1974 at the age of 86. His wife Sophia Mary \u2018Millie\u2019 Bell died a little over two years afterwards on 9 February 1977 and they are buried together in the churchyard at All Saints' Church, Wrington. There is a pathway off School Road in Wrington, Bell\u2019s Walk, which was named after the doctor. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People from Wrington Category:British fishers Category:20th-century British medical doctors ==External links== * http://webdatauk.wixsite.com/dr-bell ",
