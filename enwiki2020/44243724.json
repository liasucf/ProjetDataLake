Westmoreland personally took part in site selection. Westmoreland chose the name \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m meaning \"united hearts and minds\" or \"singleness of mind, in thoughts, and actions\" in Vietnamese. The total construction price for the Army and Navy ran close to $8,000,000. Due to lack of available dry land, the base was created by dredging from the river. Dredging work to create the base commenced in August 1966 and involved the reclamation of 600 acres of swampland. The Vietcong attempted to sabotage the base construction sinking the dredgeship Jamaica Bay on 9 January 1967 with the loss of 3 crewmembers. In January 1967 the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry was deployed to \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m to provide base and construction security followed in March by Headquarters, 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division which moved from Bearcat Base. In April the US Navy River Assault Squadron 9 was deployed to \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m to support operations. On 1 June 1967, the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) comprising the 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division and the US Navy River Assault Squadrons 9 and 11 was established at \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m. By this time the base occupied 12 square kilometres and included a 500m runway and a loading basin for boats. From June\u2013December 1967 base facilities grew providing improved support and rest and recreation for the MRF. The Vietcong regularly harassed the base with mortar fire. Other units stationed at \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m included: *1st Battalion, 11th Artillery (1968 \u2013 August 1969) *3rd Surgical Hospital (May 1967 \u2013 September 1969) ===1969\u201375=== On 1 September 1969 \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m was turned over to the ARVN 7th Division which moved its headquarters there from M\u1ef9 Tho. When President D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh announced the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on 30 April 1975, ARVN Brigadier General Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Hai committed suicide at the base ==Current use== The base was abandoned and turned over to farmland and housing while the harbour area is used for fishing and transport vessels. Harbor area as of Tet of 2018 is government controlled and leases facilities for civilian marine construction purposes. Access to this area requires government approval. ==References== Category:Installations of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Category:United States Navy installations Category:Riverine warfare Category:Installations of the United States Army in South Vietnam Category:Buildings and structures in Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province ",
