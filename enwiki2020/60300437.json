    "text": "Endless is a London-based contemporary artist. Much of his work portrays a neutral homage to the key elements of society today, covering off aspects such as brand worship, advertising, consumerism and celebrity culture. Endless makes much of his art on the streets, but his work can also be found in London galleries and in homes. alt=www.info|thumb|422x422px|Endless artist honoring late German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld at the Pitti Immagine Uomo fashion fair on 12 June 2019 in Florence, Tuscany. {| !Endless artist ! |- |Known for |Graffiti - Street art |- |Website |https://www.endlesstheartist.com |} Chapel Glitter - Mixed Media and resin finish ==Early Career== Endless is inspired by popular culture, consumerism and advertising. In his artworks he addresses topics like wealthiness, sex and religion, often using recognisable symbols and logos, and describes a modern world where brands and celebrities are the new Gods to worship. Endless\u2019 first foray into the art world was over a decade ago through creating bold street art across London. His first major opportunity came from Ed Burstell in 2016, then the boss of high-end department store, Liberty. Upon noticing Endless\u2019 artwork whilst walking to work one day, Ed contacted Endless with an opportunity to paint the department stores main display window in honour of the 40 year anniversary of the punk movement. This made Endless the first ever street artist in history to paint the department stores coveted windows. Talking of the moment and the artist, Ed Burstell, said: \"After spotting Endless\u2019 art dotted across the streets of London, I knew right away that he would be perfect to paint Liberty\u2019s tribute to the punk movement.\u201d The artist has since worked with British art duo Gilbert and George. Endless\u2019 has been asked to paint within a number of iconic spots across London and Europe. He was responsible for decorating the OXO Tower Bar and Brasserie in London, and even created the first wall mural in Cortina d'Ampezzo (Italy). ==Exhibitions and Performances == *19 January - 12 April 2015 - Gilbert & George x Endless Crusade 2014 at the Utopia Pictures exhibition by Gilbert & George, ARNDT, Singapore *December 2015 - Gilbert & George x Endless Crusade 2014, installation at the National Gallery of Canberra, Australia *July 2016 - Endless commissioned to paint the Liberty store's main display window and front doors, London, UK *22 October \u2013 2 November 2016 - Graffik Gallery, UK - Endless presents Worship at Graffik: An exhibition featuring Gilbert & George * 29 November \u2013 4 December 2016 - Scope Miami * February 2017 - Buster & Punch UK - Endless Presents Filth in collaboration with Buster & Punch * 26 April \u2013 28 June 2017 - Chelsea Waterside Artspace - The Royal Variety Adornment - A solo exhibition by Endless * 3 August \u2013 30 September 2017 - Exhibitionist Hotel, Kensington Beaut presentation, a solo exhibition * 8 November \u2013 10 December 2017 - The Holiday House London - Show *February 2018 - Chapel artwork - the Oxo Tower Restaurant, London, UK * 15 March \u2013 22 March 2018 - London Design Week - Show at Shock London * 12 \u2013 30 April 2018 - Blattler London Crotch Grab - Solo exhibition * 10 June \u2013 30 November 2018 - Venice Liquid Identity Show * 12 -20 June 2018 - Opera Gallery London - Exclusive Gilbert & George Croth Grab Artwork * 12 -15 October 2018 - Art Verona \u2013 with Cris Contini Contemporary, Italy - Show * 8-11 December 2018 - Contemporary and Co Cortina, Italy - Exhibition and live painting *March 2019 - Video projection of the artwork 'Crotch Grab' on the Flannels Building's windows, Oxford Street, London, UK *20 - 22 March 2019 - Murales THE KINGDOM OF THE FANES - Mural at the State Art High School (Polo Val Boite) in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Cortina, Italy *30 June 2019 - Live performance during the Mayfair Art Weekend, London, UK *11 - 14 June 2019 - Live performance at Pitti Uomo, Florence, Italy *16 July 2019 - Live performance for \"Contemporary art for the marginalized\", charity event in collaboration with Christie\u2019s and Cris Contini Contemporary, Rome, Italy *August 2019 - Karl Lagerfeld - the Oxo Tower Restaurant, London, UK *The House of Karl Lagerfeld launches 'A Tribute to Karl: The White Shirt Project' at Paris Fashion Week *3 October 2019 - Live performance at the Fiorucci store, London in occasion on the launch of the Fiorucci x Endless collection at Fiorucci Store, London, UK *October 2019 - Her Majesty mural for the 50 years of the Abbey Road album by the Beatles, Abbey Road Studios, London, UK *8 - 17 November 2019 - Endless Karl exhibition, Cris Contini Contemporary Gallery, London, UK in occasion of the launch of the Karl x Endless capsule collection at Karl Lagerfeld store, London, UK *5 - 8 December 2019 - Endless showing at Rosenbaum Gallery - Art Basel *12 December 2019 - Endless Night Vol 1, a one night show at Cris Contini Contemporary Gallery, London - Hosted by Motionless Fine Art ==References== Category:21st-century British artists Category:Artists from London ",
