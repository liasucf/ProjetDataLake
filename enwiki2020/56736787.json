They didn't qualify and Santos did not get to run the final. Similarly, USA was able to rest their stars, Michael Cherry and Aldrich Bailey while successfully qualifying for the final. In the final, USA was out fast with Fred Kerley having a marginal edge at the break, but extending it by running an efficient tangent from lane 6, netting himself a 3-metre lead over Poland's Karol Zalewski. Zalewski kept that gap for most of the second lap, losing a little ground in the handoff. Kerley's split 44.84. The Borl\u00e9e brothers, represented by Dylan Borl\u00e9e, representing Belgium were an equal gap back. With an efficient handoff to Michael Cherry, USA gained another 3 metres. Through the second leg, Rafa\u0142 Omelko chipped away at Cherry's lead, by the time the handoff took place, the gap between USA and Poland was back to 3 metres. Behind them, Jereem Richards brought Trinidad and Tobago past Jonathan Borl\u00e9e and approached passing Omelko before fading back. Cherry's split was 45.39. The third leg for USA was Aldrich Bailey, vs Poland's \u0141ukasz Krawczuk, Bailey lost another meter as Poland, Trinidad and Tobago and Belgium gained. Bailey's split 46.10. After taking the baton, USA's Vernon Norwood accelerated to open another metre. Behind him, Poland's Jakub Krzewina led the pursuers, with TTO's Lalonde Gordon and Belgium's Kevin Borl\u00e9e in close order. By the end of the first lap, Norwood had extended the lead to 5 metres, but down the final backstretch, the lead began to shrink. Coming off the final turn, Krzewina had a burst of speed, Norwood straightened up and tightened up, Krzewina went by. Five metres back Borl\u00e9e was attempting a similar move on Gordon, without as much authority. In a tight battle for bronze, Borl\u00e9e was able to outlearn Gordon. Poland's winning time was a new world indoor record, beating USA's team from four years earlier. The final split was timed at 45.44 from when Norwood crossed the line, but considering he made up at least three metres, Krzewina's time was considerably faster. Behind them, Belgium and Trinidad and Tobago set national records. ==Results== ===Heats=== The heats were started on 3 March at 12:32.Heats results {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !!
