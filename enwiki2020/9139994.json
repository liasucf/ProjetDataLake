He received the Order of the Legion of Honour of France. ==Biography== He studied medicine in Havana and Barcelona, earning his medical licence in 1877. Afterwards, he relocated to Paris, where he studied histology with Louis-Antoine Ranvier (1835\u20131922). In Paris, he interned under several renowned physicians, including urologist Jean Casimir F\u00e9lix Guyon (1831\u20131920), who served as an important influence to Albarr\u00e1n's career. In 1892 he became professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9, followed by chirurgien des h\u00f4pitaux two years later. In 1906 he succeeded Guyon as director of the clinic of urology at H\u00f4pital Necker. Albarr\u00e1n's early career was largely spent in the fields of microbiology and histopathology, later switching to urology, a discipline in which he made several important contributions. He performed the first perineal prostatectomy in France, and is credited with introducing the so-called \"Albarr\u00e1n lever\", a device used for adjusting the movements of a cystoscope during the catheterization of the ureter. In 1912 he was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Medicine.NCBI Joaquin Maria Albarran Y Dominguez: microbiologist, histologist, and urologist, etc. == Associated eponyms == * Albarran-Ormond syndrome: Inflammatory retroperitoneal fibrosis, usually associated with urinary obstruction.
