Her works also include installation art, body painting, \"traditional\" painting, ceramics and visual design in general. ==Life and work== Fabian was born in Hungary in 1984. She has been perfecting her artistic skills from an early childhood. In her mid teens she moved abroad, sharing residencies between Austria and Italy in the following years. Other than classical painting techniques, she ventured into photography, graphics and 3D design and researched topics such as observation of natural phenomena and social relationships. Her work is often based on primary questions of human existence with her visual themes regularly focusing on space and universe-depictions. Her art pieces were awarded at several contests and competitions in different countries and many of them were featured in newspapers, magazines, galleries and exhibitions. == Murals and Glow-in-the- Dark Technique == In her mid-twenties Fabian started experimenting with mural designs and fluorescent and glow-in-the-dark colours, mixing her two main interests that created her most-known art pieces. By applying complex painting techniques and a wide range of colors and pigments, she creates a starry atmosphere, visually opening up confined spaces, usually applying a three- dimensional effect in the daylight as well as in the dark or under UV light. == Other Interests == In addition to unique wall and body painting, her current pursuits include ceramic designs and an in-depth approach to questions of consciousness and existence. == External links == * Official Website ==References== Category:Hungarian artists Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
