The city's Niederau\u00dfem district is one of the most important suppliers for energy from lignites in Europe. St. Johann Baptist (Niederau\u00dfem) church, which is over 700 years old == Geography == Bergheim is about 20 km west of Cologne, approximately 72 metres above sea level. Its highest point is the Glessener H\u00f6he (Glessen Height) at 204 metres. The Erft River flows through Bergheim. The city lies in the Z\u00fclpicher B\u00f6rde, which belongs to the K\u00f6lner Bucht. Economically and geographically Bergheim is in the Rhenish lignite coalfield. == History == There is a burial hill in Niederau\u00dfem, dating from about 4000 BC. Romans settled in Bergheim around 50 BC. They constructed the major Roman road, the Via Belgica, that crossed the area where Bergheim is today. Later the Franks took control over the region. In the Middle Ages, Bergheim was granted city rights and later became part of the County of J\u00fclich. In the 19th and 20th centuries Bergheim grew rapidly through the settlement of industry based on the local lignite coal. In World War II, the Wesseling synthetic oil plant was bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. Then in April 1944, a large underground plant for synthetic oil manufactured from lignite was set up outside Bergheim. ==Districts== * Ahe * Auenheim * Bergheim-Mitte * B\u00fcsdorf * Fliesteden * Glesch * Glessen * Kenten * Niederau\u00dfem * Oberau\u00dfem * Paffendorf * Quadrath-Ichendorf * Rheidt-H\u00fcchelhoven * Thorr * Zieverich ==Points of interest== Points of interest are the Niederaussem Power Station with the world's tallest cooling tower as well as the Kottenforst-Ville Nature Park. ==Notable people== * Gerhard Fieseler (1896\u20131987), fighter pilot in the First World War and aircraft constructor (Gerhard-Fieseler-Werke) * G\u00fcnter Grass (1927\u20132015): writer, Nobel Prize 1999, after the end of the Second World War he lived in Bergheim-Oberaussem for several years. * Sarah Kreuz (born 1989), singer, second place with DSDS * The footballer Lukas Podolski grew up in Bergheim, played in the youth team of FC Jugend 07 Bergheim from 1991 onwards.
