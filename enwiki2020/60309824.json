In 1909 she began teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where her brother John was serving as director. One of her student at the Art Institute was Georgia O'Keeffe Also in 1909 she established, with her friend, the artist Jean Sherwood, the \"Holiday House Association\" in Boulder, to \"conserve the health of tired working women\". First they built a dwelling called the Blue Bird Cottage near the site of the Colorado Chautauqua. In 1921 they expanded into the town of Gold Hill where they converted an hotel into the Blue Bird Lodge. The Blue Bird Lodge served as a vacation spot for Chicago's working-class women, providing a respite from the city. The lodge was sold in 1962 by the Holiday House Association, but the building continues to function as an hotel. In 1923 Vanderpoel and other members of her family bought their own cabin in Gold Hill named \"Sunset View\". The same year her painting \"Morning in the Rockies\" was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago. She died on October 21, 1950 in Chicago. ==References== Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:1862 births Category:1950 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American women painters Category:Art educators Category:Artists from Chicago Category:Dutch emigrants to the United States Category:People from Haarlemmermeer Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Matilda ",
