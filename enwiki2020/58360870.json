It was the northern terminus of the line, situated north of Gourdon station. The goods yard was to the east and there was a locomotive shed nearby as well as a carriage siding to the south of the platform. The station's name was changed to Inverbervie on 5 July 1926. The station closed to regular passenger services in 1951, but continued to be used for goods trains until the last train (which was a passenger train to mark the occasion of the final closure of the station) ran on 22 May 1966. == References == == External links == * http://lightmoor.co.uk/books/the-montrose-bervie-railway/L9969 * https://www.flickr.com/photos/irishswissernie/45379911341 Category:Disused railway stations in Aberdeenshire Category:Former North British Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1865 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:1865 establishments in Scotland Category:1951 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Inverbervie ",
