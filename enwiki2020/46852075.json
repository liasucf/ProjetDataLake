The construction of the statue was done by a seven-man core team led by a Pilipino sculptor John A. Alaban from Roxas City and the foreman Jose Clarito. As of the date of completion, the giant statue of The Sacred Heart of Jesus of Roxas City is considered the largest life like statue of Jesus Christ in the Philippines. The 30 ft. deep 20 ft.x20 ft. wide excavation for the foundation of the statue Laying out the excavation site for the foundation of the statue It took a little more than three years for a seven-man core team to complete the construction but since the work runs on and off, the actual work span could be summed up to only about two years and 8 months more or less. The statue has a maximum height of 102 ft. / 31 m and mounted on a 9m / 30 ft high base making the total height . It is supported by a 0.40 m thick by elevator shaft style reinforced concrete core post. Every level of 3 meters high (equivalent to one standard building floor height) is separated by a horizontal slab. Inside the hollow statue is an access steel stair up to the 8th level. The stairs is for the use of the authorize crew only and is off limits to the public. Since one of the concepts of the construction is the so-called \u201cbuilt to last\u201d, some forms or aesthetics have been deliberately compromised to give way to the stability of the structural design for the safety of the general public.https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.752426818168966.1073741874.318194818258837&type;=1 Facebook, January 5, 2015. == Gallery == File:Lifting the face armature.jpg|The team preparing to install the armature of the statue's face File:Finger nail of the statue.jpg|Showing the size of the statue's fingernail compared to the sculptor's hand.
