    "text": "Autumn Peltier (born September 27, 2004) is a Canadian indigenous clean water advocate who is Anishinaabe-kwe and a member of the Wiikwemkoong First Nation. She is a water protector and has been called a \"water warrior\". In 2018, at the age of thirteen, Peltier addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on the issue of water protection. == Early life == Peltier lives on Lake Huron, one of the largest groups of freshwater lakes on Earth. She comes from the territory of Wikwemkoong, a First Nations reserve. Currently, she lives in Ottawa and attended St. Mother Teresa High School. Peltier grew up understanding the importance of water and the need to protect it. She also advocates for the universal right to clean drinking water, raising awareness towards water rights and ensuring communities have access to clean, safe and reliable drinking water. As young as the age of 8, Peltier was attending water ceremonies on First Nation reserves. She continues her work for the access of clean water concerning Indigenous peoples across the world (\"Autumn Peltier\" 2020). == Water advocacy == Peltier gained national and international notice when, at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations, she presented Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a copper water pot and, although she did not have time to deliver her prepared speech, she confronted Trudeau on his record on water protection and his support for pipelines. Her act inspired the Assembly of First Nations to create the Niabi Odacidae fund. She has attended international events such as the Children's Climate Conference in Sweden. In April 2019, Peltier was named the chief water commissioner by the Anishinabek Nation. This position was previously held by her great-aunt, Josephine Mandamin. In September 2019, Peltier was nominated for an International Children's Peace Prize and named as one of the United States Union of Concerned Scientists list of 2019 Science Defenders. She was also invited to speak at the United Nation Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York, in 2018 and 2019. == Public response and impact == Peltier was given the title \"Water Warrior\" (NAAEE, 2018). She has been the voice for the universal right of clean drinking water, specifically safe drinking water for Indigenous communities in Canada (NAAEE, 2018). She gained a lot of public attention when she confronted Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau in 2016 during the First Nation's annual winter meeting, telling him \"I am very unhappy with the choices you made\" (Zettler, 2019). Peltier expressed her concern about the lack of safe drinking water in various Indigenous communities across Canada, especially from Trudeau's support of pipelines as mentioned above. Peltier further gained attention when she spoke at The Global Landscapes Forum in New York City in September 2018, where she addressed the United Nations and important decision-makers (Zettler, 2019). This conference also allowed her to further spread awareness around the world for her cause and spark a change. She uses various platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, where she has over 100 thousand followers, to spread her water advocacy (Zettler, 2019). Overall, she has been receiving vast amounts of support from youth, politicians, and other activists. She has contributed greatly to bringing attention to the issues of the absence of clean drinking water in indigenous communities. == Awards and recognition == * Nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize, 2017, 2018, 2019. * Canadian Living Me to We Award Youth in Action under 12, 2017. *Ontario Junior Citizens Award, Ontario Newspaper Association, 2017. *Sovereign Medal of Exceptional Volunteerism, by Governor General of Canada and Lieutenant Governor Of Ontario, March 2017 *Ottawa Riverkeeper Award, 2018. * Water Warrior Award at the Water Docs Film Festival in Toronto, 2019. *Young Leader Award, Ontario Municipal Social Services Association Award, 2019. *Named Top 30 under 30 in North America for Environmental Education making a difference, 2019. *Named to the BBC 100 Women list for 2019. *Named to Maclean's list of 20 to Watch in 2020. *Named to Huffington Post's list of 15 Canadian Icons Who Stole our Hearts in 2019. *Named to the Union of Concerned Scientists list of 2019 Science Defenders. *Named as a Chatelaine 2019 Woman of the Year. == References == Category:Living people Category:2004 births Category:Anishinaabe people Category:Canadian child activists Category:Canadian women environmentalists Category:Canadian environmentalists Category:First Nations activists Category:First Nations women Category:People from Manitoulin Island Category:BBC 100 Women ",
