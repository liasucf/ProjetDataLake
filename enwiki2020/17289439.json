    "text": "The Pirates of Penzance is a 1983 British-American romantic musical comedy film written and directed by Wilford Leach based on Gilbert and Sullivan's 1879 comic opera of the same name. The film, starring Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt, George Rose, and Rex Smith, is an adaptation of the 1980 Joseph Papp production of Pirates. The original Broadway cast reprised their roles in the film, except that Lansbury replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. Choreography was by Graciela Daniele. It was produced by Papp and filmed at Shepperton Studios in London. ==Plot== Frederic was sent in the care of his nursemaid, Ruth, to be apprenticed to a pilot. But she misunderstood her instructions, being hard of hearing, and apprenticed him instead to the Pirate King. Now turning 21 years old, his service is finished, so he decides to leave the Pirates of Penzance. Ruth wants him to take her with him, but he soon meets some young maidens, the daughters of Major-General Stanley, and realizes that Ruth is \"plain and old.\" Frederic quickly falls in love with one of them, Mabel. He has a strong \"sense of duty\" and has vowed to lead a blameless life and to exterminate the pirates. Soon, however, the pirates return and seize the young ladies. Their father then arrives and lies to the pirates, telling them that he is an orphan. He knows that the pirates are orphans themselves and never attack another orphan. After the pirates leave, General Stanley wrestles with his conscience, having told a lie. Mabel and Frederic try to cheer him up, and Frederic has engaged the constabulary to help him defeat the pirates. The police arrive, but they turn out to be timid. Then the pirate king and Ruth find Frederic alone. They have reviewed the fine print on his apprenticeship indenture and have discovered that he is still a pirate because he was born in leap year on February 29, and he will not be out of his indentures to the pirates until his 21st birthday. Mabel agrees to wait for Frederic until then. The Police return and, hearing the pirates approach, they hide. The pirates arrive and seize the still guilt-ridden Major-General. The police are coaxed to battle the pirates, but they are defeated. However, the Sergeant of Police calls on the pirates to \"yield in Queen Victoria's name.\" The pirates tearfully do so and release the Major-General, surrendering to the police. However, Ruth reveals that the pirates are all \"noblemen who have gone wrong,\" and the Major-General pardons them and invites them to marry his daughters, as all ends happily. ==Cast== * Kevin Kline as The Pirate King * Angela Lansbury as Ruth * Linda Ronstadt as Mabel Stanley * George Rose as Major-General Stanley * Rex Smith as Frederic * Tony Azito as the Police Sergeant * David Hatton as Samuel ** Stephen Hanan as Samuel's singing voice * Louise Gold as Edith ** Alexandra Korey as Edith's singing voice * Teresa Codling as Kate ** Marcie Shaw as Kate's singing voice * Tilly Vosburgh as Isabel ==Musical numbers== # Overture # Pour, oh Pour the Pirate Sherry \u2013 Pirates and Samuel # When Frederic Was a Little Lad+ \u2013 Ruth # Oh Better Far to Live and Die++ \u2013 Pirate King # Oh False One, You Have Deceived Me \u2013 Frederic and Ruth # Climbing Over Rocky Mountain+ \u2013 Major General's Daughters # Stop, Ladies, Pray \u2013 Frederic and Daughters # Oh Is There Not One Maiden Breast+ \u2013 Frederic and Daughters # Oh Sisters, Deaf to Pity's Name \u2013 Mabel and Daughters # Poor Wandering One++ \u2013 Mabel and Daughters # Stay, We Must Not Lose Our Senses \u2013 Frederic, Daughters and Pirates # Hold Monsters and I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General+ \u2013 Mabel, Major General and Chorus # Act I Finale \u2013 Company # Oh Dry the Glistening Tear* \u2013 Mabel and Daughters # When the Foeman Bares His Steel++ \u2013 Sergeant of Police # Now for the Pirate's Lair \u2013 Frederic, King and Ruth # When You Had Left Our Pirate Fold+ \u2013 Ruth, King and Frederic # My Eyes are Fully Open (from Ruddigore) \u2013 Frederic, Ruth and King # Away, Away, My Heart's on Fire \u2013 King, with Frederic and Ruth # Stay, Frederic, Stay \u2013 Mabel and Frederic # Ah, Leave Me Not to Pine \u2013 Mabel and Frederic # Oh Here Is Love and Here Is Truth \u2013 Mabel and Frederic # No, I Am Brave+ and Sergeant, Approach+++ \u2013 Mabel, Police and Sergeant # When a Felon's Not Engaged in His Employment+ \u2013 Sergeant and Police # A Rollicking Band of Pirates, We \u2013 Sergeant, Pirates and Police # With Cat Like Tread++ \u2013 Pirates and Police # Sighing Softly to the River \u2013 Major-General and Men # Act II Finale++ \u2013 Company ;Differences from the stage version :+Shortened :++Extended :+++Originally dialogue. :Omitted: How Beautifully Blue the Sky ==Release== ===Box office=== Theater owners boycotted The Pirates of Penzance because Universal Pictures released it simultaneously to theaters and to subscription television services SelecTV and ONTV.Shepherd, Marc. \"Papp's Pirates\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, July 7, 2010, accessed January 31, 2015 The film opened theatrically in the United States on February 18, 1983 and earned $255,496 from 91 venues in its opening weekend, ranking fourteenth in the box office.
