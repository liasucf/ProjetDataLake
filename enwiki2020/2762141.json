Malta has been a FIBA member since 1967, and competes at tournaments such as the European Championship for Small Countries, and the Games of the Small States of Europe. ==History== Malta made their official debut at the 1985 Games of the Small States of Europe, where they achieved the bronze medal. The team repeated success at the next edition, although they did not win another medal again until the 1997 tournament. There they surprisingly won the silver medal after defeating Luxembourg in the semifinals, and losing to Cyprus in the final. In 2001 and 2003, Malta joined the qualifying stages of the EuroBasket for the 2003 and 2005 editions respectively. However, they failed to qualify for both tournaments, as the team finished with six losses in six games played each time. Malta also participated in all the editions of the European Championship for Small Countries, but did not win any medal until 2010, when they beat Moldova for the bronze medal. In 2012, they won the bronze again and in 2014, lost to Andorra in the final 66\u201363 to take home silver. On 1 July 2018, Malta won their first official title after beating Norway, by the score of 75\u201359 in the final of the 2018 European Championship for Small Countries. Samuel Deguara claimed the MVP title. After this success, Malta decided to take part in the Games of the Small States of Europe in 2019. ==Competitive record== ===At Eurobasket=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|EuroBasket !rowspan=4| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Pos. !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 2003||colspan=4|Did not qualify |6||0||6 |- | 2005||colspan=4|Division B |6||0||6 |} {| |valign=top width=0%| ===At the Championship for Small Countries=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|Championship for Small Countries |- !Year !Pos. !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1988||6th||5||2||3 |- | 1990||7th||5||2||3 |- | 1992||6th||5||1||4 |- | 1994||6th||5||1||4 |- | 1996||7th||5||1||4 |- | 1998||5th||4||0||4 |- | 2000||5th||5||2||3 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2002||7th||5||1||4 |- | 2004||9th||4||0||4 |- | 2006||8th||5||1||4 |- | 2008||7th||5||1||4 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2010||bgcolor=#cc9966|||5||3||2 |- | 2012||bgcolor=#cc9966|||5||3||2 |- | 2014||bgcolor=silver|||4||3||1 |- | 2016||6th||5||2||3 |- | 2018||bgcolor=gold|||4||2||2 |- !colspan=2|Total!! 76 !! 25 !! 51 |} |valign=top width=0%| ===At the Games of the Small States=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|Games of the Small States of Europe |- !Year !Pos. !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 1985||bgcolor=#cc9966|||3||1||2 |- | 1987||bgcolor=#cc9966|||3||2||1 |- | 1989||5th||3||1||2 |- | 1991||5th||4||3||1 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1993||6th||5||1||4 |- | 1995||5th||3||1||2 |- | 1997||bgcolor=silver|||4||3||1 |- | 2001||6th||4||2||2 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2003||7th||3||0||3 |- | 2005||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not enter |- | 2007 |- | 2009||5th||5||1||4 |- | 2013||colspan=4 rowspan=3|Did not enter |- | 2015 |- | 2017 |- | 2019||4th||4||1||3 |- !colspan=2|Total!! 41 !! 16 !! 25 |- |} |} ==Team== ===Current roster=== Roster for the 2019 Games of the Small States of Europe: ===Depth chart=== ==Kit== ===Manufacturer=== 2018: Macron ===Sponsor=== 2018: TEAMSPORT ==See also== *Sport in Malta *Malta women's national basketball team * Malta national under-19 basketball team * Malta national under-17 basketball team * Malta national 3x3 team ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Malta at FIBA site *Malta National Team - Men at Eurobasket.com Category:National basketball teams Basketball ",
