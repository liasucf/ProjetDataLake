    "text": "Anna Magdalena () is a 1998 Hong Kong romantic fantasy comedy film starring Aaron Kwok, Kelly Chen and Takeshi Kaneshiro. It was the directorial debut of production designer Yee Chung-Man. ==Title== The title refers to the keyboard piece Minuet in G Major believed to have been written by Johann Sebastian Bach's colleague, Christian Petzold, from the 1725 Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. Anna Magdalena was Bach's second wife. The music attracts the attention of Chan Kar-fu and Yau Muk-yan as Mok Man-yee plays it on her piano. The film score uses this theme repeatedly. ==Synopsis== The film structure loosely follows that of the minuet: four \"movements\", which are announced by titles: two themes, a duet, and a set of variations. 1- Chan Kar-fu's (Takeshi Kaneshiro) introduction 2- Yau Muk-yan's (Aaron Kwok) effect on his life 3- Mok Man-Yee's (Kelly Chen) effect on their lives 4- Chan Kar-fu's literary vision of love.dragonsdenuk This fourth \"movement\" (Variations) is a wild fantasy on the previous material, based on the novel written by Kaneshiro's character: The XO Pair. Unemployed aspiring writer Yau Muk-yan (Aaron Kwok) moves into the apartment of Chan Kar-fu (Takeshi Kaneshiro), a shy piano tuner. Both will soon fall in love with their new neighbor Mok Man-Yee (Kelly Chen). ==Cast includes== * Aaron Kwok as Yau Muk-yan * Kelly Chen as Mok Man- Yee * Takeshi Kaneshiro as Chan Kar-fu * Jacky Cheung as Policeman (cameo) * Leslie Cheung as Editor (cameo) * Anita Yuen as Assistant Editor * Josie Ho as Cindy, Yau Muk-yan's former girlfriend * Leo Ku as Client in restaurant (cameo) * Eric Tsang as Building watchman (cameo) * Wei Wei as Mrs. Leung * Yu Wai-Lung as Child X * Yuki Lai as Child O * Jojo Hui as Masked woman Anna Magdalena at HKMDB Anna Magdalena at chinesemov.com ==Filming locations== * Hong Kong * Vietnam for the fantasy scenes ==Reception== The film grossed HK$7.8 million in Hong Kong. ===Awards and nominations=== *18th Hong Kong Film Awards: ** Nominated - Best Cinematography (Peter Pau) ** Nominated - Best Art Direction (Poon Chi-wai) ** Nominated - Best Costume Design (Ng Lei-lo) ** Nominated - Best Original Score (Chiu Tsang-hei) *1999 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards ** Won: Film of Merit ==See also== * Aaron Kwok filmography * List of Hong Kong films ==References== ==External links== * hkcinemagic entry (includes trailers) * lovehkfilm entry * chinesecinemas.org entry (detailed review) * fareastfilms (includes several pictures of the movie) * Russian film review (includes pictures) * brns entry (more pictures) * Soundtrack listing * * Category:Hong Kong films Category:1998 films Category:1998 romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong romantic comedy films Category:1990s romantic fantasy films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Golden Harvest films Category:Films about classical music and musicians Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Vietnam Category:1998 directorial debut films Category:1998 comedy films ",
