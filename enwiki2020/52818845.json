    "text": "\"'\" (\"Lord Jesus Christ, be present now!\", literally: Lord Jesus Christ, turn to us) is a Lutheran hymn from the 17th century. Its hymn tune, Zahn No. 624, was adopted in several compositions. It was translated into English and is part of modern hymnals. == History == Hymn in 1691 W\u00fcrttemberg hymnal with soprano clef The text of the hymn has been attributed to Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, but this authorship is doubted, as the attribution appears only in prints from the late 17th century. In Thuringia and Saxony, the hymn was sung on Sundays after the minister had entered the pulpit to deliver the sermon. In a 1668 print, the 6th edition of Lutherisch Hand-B\u00fcchlein (Lutheran handbooklet) it is assigned to Trinity Sunday (Am Fest der heiligen Dreyfaltigkeit). == Text and translations == The hymn was translated into Swedish in 1695 by Johannes Gezelius, with the title \"O Jesus Krist, dig till oss v\u00e4nd\". The hymn was translated in the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of Johann Christian Jacobi as \"Lord Christ, reveal thy holy Face\".Text and melody, Psalmodica Germanica, 1722 Catherine Winkworth translated the hymn in 1863 as a communion song with the title \"Lord Jesus Christ, be present now!\" The English translations below are those of Jacobi. 1 Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, dein\u2019 Heilgen Geist du zu uns send; mit Hilf und Gnad er uns regier und uns den Weg zur Wahrheit f\u00fchr. 2 Tu auf den Mund zum Lobe dein, bereit das Herz zur Andacht fein, den Glauben mehr, st\u00e4rk den Verstand, dass uns dein Nam werd wohlbekannt, 3 bis wir singen mit Gottes Heer: \"Heilig, heilig ist Gott der Herr!\" und schauen dich von Angesicht in ewger Freud und selgem Licht. 4 Ehr sei dem Vater und dem Sohn, dem Heilgen Geist in einem Thron; der Heiligen Dreieinigkeit sei Lob und Preis in Ewigkeit. Lord Christ, reveal thy holy Face, And send the Spirit of thy Grace, To fill our Hearts with fervent Zeal To learn thy Truth, and do thy Will. Lord, lead us in thy holy Ways, And teach our Lips to tell thy Praise, Increase our Faith, and raise the same To taste the Sweetness of thy Name. Till we with Angels join to sing Th'eternal Praise of Thee, our King; Till we shall see Thee Face to Face, And all the Glories of thy Grace. To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, Three in One, Be Honour, Praise, and Glory giv'n, By all on Earth, and all in Heav'n. == Musical settings == Krebs In Weimar, Johann Sebastian Bach and his cousin Johann Gottfried Walther, who were the organists at the Schlosskirche and the Stadtkirche, both composed several settings of the hymn. Georg B\u00f6hm, Walther and Johann Ludwig Krebs all wrote chorale partitas and variations on the hymn: Krebs wrote a chorale fantasia Krebs-WV 524. Among the most notable settings by Bach are the chorale preludes BWV 632, from the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, and BWV 655, from the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes. There are further chorale preludes BWV 709, 726 and 749, with questions over the third's authenticity. Max Reger composed a chorale prelude as No. 9 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902. He also set it in 1914 as No. 11 of his 30 little chorale preludes for organ, Op. 135a. ==Hymnals== In the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch it is EG 155, the first hymn in the section Gottesdienst \u2013 Eingang und Ausgang (Service \u2013 beginning and end). In the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob it is GL 147, in the section Messges\u00e4nge \u2013 Ges\u00e4nge zur Er\u00f6ffnung (Songs for mass \u2013 songs for the opening). ==References == == External links == * * Lord Jesus Christ, Be Present Now (organ-only mp3 of the hymn tune) Category:17th century in music Category:German Christian hymns Category:Lutheran hymns ",
