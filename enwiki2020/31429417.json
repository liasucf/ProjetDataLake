Their product line includes painted solid wood, wicker, and upholstered furniture. Customers can customize their furniture by selecting from exclusive paint colors and signature fabric patterns. Started in Yarmouth, Maine in the United States, the operation is now fully run and operated out of Annapolis, Maryland. Their products ship worldwide, and are available online at www.mainecottage.com and through a direct mail catalog. ==History== The company was founded in 1988 by Peter Bass and artist Carol Bass. It was originally located in Yarmouth, Maine in a restored cannery on the Royal River. Bass is the great grandson of Wilton, Maine shoe maker G.H. Bass. Maine Cottage was the first company to offer American Country, Early Shaker, and Mid Century Modern-inspired painted wood furniture in a multitude of original colors. The idea originated with artist Carol Bass painting and selling \"found\" pieces of cottage furniture. The company then began to design furniture and paint its own custom pieces. Maine Cottage expanded its product line with the introduction of their textile line in 2000, producing colorful whimsical patterns for use on their nostalgic upholstery and wicker furniture lines. ==Russell & Mackenna== * In 2001, as Maine Cottage was continuing expansion efforts a competing furniture company called Russell & Mackenna was launched. Russell & Mackenna got its start after Lauren and Kevin Russell began designing and building furniture in their Severna Park, Maryland garage. Lauren's father, Larry Strassner, was recruited in 2004 to help with financial and operational aspects of the business freeing Lauren to focus on designing for and marketing the company. When Russell & Mackenna outgrew their garage manufacturing, they employed artisan furniture builders in Delaware to continue the bench-built, made-to-order method of production. When their signature piece, the High Tide Hall Table, was featured in Coastal Living Magazine the brand gained a loyal following nationwide. * In 2006, Russell & Mackenna launched an upholstered furniture line adding a playful element to their painted furniture collection with bright colors and cheerful prints. * By 2009, under Strassner's leadership, Russell & Mackenna was a multimillion-dollar business. Designs were sold direct-to-consumer and specified by members of the trade in coastal inspired homes around the country. * In 2011, Maine Cottage was in financial distress and faced foreclosure. Russell & Mackenna acted quickly and acquired the intellectual property of their competitor, Maine Cottage. Product lines were merged and the resulting company continued to run operations as Maine Cottage. The Maine Cottage Flagship Store located in Annapolis, MD. ==Coastal Brands== In January 2016, Maine Cottage merged with outdoor furniture company Thos. Baker and created a parent company called Coastal Brands headquartered on Bainbridge Island, off the coast of Seattle, Washington. Larry Strassner resigned from Maine Cottage while his daughter, Lauren Russell, remained on as the Chief Creative Officer for the Brand. John Thomas Baker IV took over as Chairman and CEO. During Baker\u2019s tenure, the business focused on growing the direct mail catalog channel and looking for growth capital. ==Balsam Brands== In January 2018, Baker, along with 21 shareholders, sold Coastal Brands to Balsam Brands in Redwood City, California. Balsam Hill, the artificial Christmas Tree company, is the flagship brand of Balsam Brands. CEO, Thomas Harman kept Maine Cottage operations in Annapolis with Lauren Russell in charge of all creative aspects of the business, and Sarah Wright in charge of all operational aspects. ==Bespoke Color Co.== In October of 2019, Lauren Russell and Sarah Wright formed Bespoke Color Company and bought back the Maine Cottage brand. The two women have worked together as part of the management team for eleven years and through all three acquisitions. Together they currently act as Co- Presidents of the Maine Cottage brand, with operations in Annapolis, MD and made-to-order furniture crafted in America. ==Brand Ethos== Maine Cottage refers to itself as a laid-back luxury brand, a term they coined when they realized they were predominantly a casual lifestyle brand but also retained a quality level associated with high-end luxury brands. Maine Cottage style speaks to a quintessential waterside town filled with first and second homes \u2014 retreats where families have gathered for generations to recharge their batteries and escape the stress of everyday life. These havens are spirited, refreshing, rejuvenating even therapeutic getaways. Maine Cottage furniture fits in well because it is colorful, inviting, uplifting and solidly built. ==Sales Channels== Today Maine Cottage operates an interactive e-commerce website and maintains a design blog called \"Color Cue.\" Along with the digital channel, the company produces a coffee table style catalog, coined its \u201cColorbook.\u201d The first catalog, printed in 1989, featured 5 pieces of furniture and 3 paint colors. Generally the Colorbook is produced every other year and was most recently published in 2019. A copy can be requested on the company website. The company also produces standard direct mail catalogs, which had an annual distribution of 850K copies in 2019. ==Products== Maine Cottage Inga Trestle Dining Table in Sprout with Maple Top.
