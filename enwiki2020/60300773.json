    "text": "Jeremiah 43 is the forty-third chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains prophecies attributed to the prophet Jeremiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter is part of a narrative section consisting of chapters 37 to 44. Chapters 42-44 describe the emigration to Egypt involving the remnant who remained in Judah after much of the population was exiled to Babylon. In this chapter, Jeremiah performs in Egypt one of the sign-acts distinctive of his prophetic style.Rudd, S., 33 Theatrical Prophetic Sign Acts in the Bible, accessed 4 April 2019 == Text == The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 13 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 4QJerd (4Q72a; mid 2nd century BCE) with extant verses 2\u201110, and 2QJer (2Q13; 1st century CE), with extant verses 8\u201111. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (with a different chapter numbering), made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==Parashot== The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As reflected in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English. Jeremiah 43 is a part of the \"Sixteenth prophecy (Jeremiah 40-45)\" in the section of Prophecies interwoven with narratives about the prophet's life (Jeremiah 26-45). {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. : {S} 43:1 {S} 43:2-7 {S} 43:8-13 {P} ==Verse numbering== The order of chapters and verses of the Book of Jeremiah in the English Bibles, Masoretic Text (Hebrew), and Vulgate (Latin), in some places differs from that in the Septuagint (LXX, the Greek Bible used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and others) according to Rahlfs or Brenton. The following table is taken with minor adjustments from Brenton's Septuagint, page 971. The order of Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study (CATSS) based on Alfred Rahlfs' Septuaginta (1935) differs in some details from Joseph Ziegler's critical edition (1957) in G\u00f6ttingen LXX. Swete's Introduction mostly agrees with Rahlfs' edition (=CATSS). {| class=wikitable !Hebrew, Vulgate, English!!Rahlfs' LXX (CATSS) |- |align=center|43:1-13 |align=center|50:1-13 |- |align=center|36:1-32 |align=center|43:1-32 |} ==Verses 5\u20136== :But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all nations where they had been driven\u2014 men, women, children, the king\u2019s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah.
