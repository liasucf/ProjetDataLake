    "text": "Dead Wrong (; literally \"Fatal Resurrection\") is a 2016 Hong Kong television drama produced by Lam Chi-wah and TVB. It stars Roger Kwok as Vincent Wai, a man who was abducted and imprisoned on a deserted island for ten years. After being rescued, he struggles to adjust to his new life, but soon learns that there was more to his abduction than it meets the eye. He sets out on a path of vengeance, with devastating consequences. Dead Wrong premiered with two back-to-back episodes on TVB Jade in Hong Kong and Astro On Demand in Malaysia on 20 November 2016. It was one of three TVB television dramas used to welcome the broadcaster's 49th anniversary. The final episode aired on 17 December 2016. ==Plot== During a business trip to Vietnam in 2006, Hong Kong business consultant Vincent Wai and his team get abducted by a local Vietnamese crime gang, who attempt to ransom them for money. Vincent's assistant, Max Hong, manages to escape their captors, but Vincent is taken to an uninhabited island off the shore of Ho Chi Minh City, where he is locked in a prison. Most of the gang members die in a shootout with the police, and the line of evidence leading to Vincent's whereabouts are wiped clean. After being missing for ten years, the Hong Kong Court declares Vincent legally dead. Ten years later in 2016, a battered and malnourished Vincent escapes his prison and is rescued by a Vietnamese fisherman. He returns to Hong Kong to reunite with his family, but learns that his declared death had lost him his identity and assets. His wife Cathy is also already remarried to their friend Yan, a private investigator. With nothing more left to hold on to, Vincent returns to his old firm, where he is warmly received. With the help of his former assistant Max and his superior Queenie Yip, Vincent rebuilds his business consulting empire. As Vincent struggles to adjust to his new life, he learns that his abduction ten years previously had far broader implications than just a scuffle with some gang members. Some of his friends, including his closest family, were involved. Vincent finds himself embarking on a journey of revenge, with deadly consequences. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== *Roger Kwok as Vincent Wai Yat-sing (\u97cb\u9038\u6607; wai4 jat6 sing1), the series' central character, a talented Hong Kong business consultant who was abducted and imprisoned on a deserted island off the coast of Vietnam for ten years.

Intelligent and assiduous, Vincent rebuilds his business empire at Outstanding Consulting Group and attempts to restart his life with new purpose, but suffers the psychological repercussions of his imprisonment. Upon discovering that his abduction had far broader implications than just a scuffle with some gang members, Vincent sets on getting revenge on those who are responsible, winning back the ten years he had lost. *Joey Meng as Cathy Yuen Kiu (\u962e\u55ac; jyun2 kiu4), a solicitor.

In the first few years of Vincent's disappearance, Cathy visited Vietnam every year to search for his whereabouts, but to no avail.
