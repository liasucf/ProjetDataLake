    "text": "Clyde Everett Lassen (March 14, 1942 - April 1, 1994), a native of Fort Myers, Florida, was a Commander in the United States Navy and a Naval Aviator. As a Lieutenant, he received the Medal of Honor for his rescue of two downed Naval Aviators while piloting a search and rescue helicopter in Vietnam. ==The mission== On June 19, 1968, Lassen, then a 26-year-old Lieutenant, junior grade flying a UH-2A Seasprite of HC-7 (assigned to the ), embarked on a mission to recover two downed Naval Aviators (from VF-33, off the ) whose F-4J plane had been shot down on a night interdiction mission deep inside North Vietnam. Upon reaching the hilly terrain where the aviators were hiding, Lassen made several attempts to recover the aviators, but dense tree cover, enemy weapons fire and intermittent illumination frustrated his efforts. Lassen turned on the landing lights of the helicopter, despite the danger of revealing his position to the enemy. After the pilots made their way to the helicopter and with his bullet-riddled helicopter dangerously low on fuel, Lassen evaded further antiaircraft fire before landing safely at sea on board the with only five minutes of fuel left in the helicopter's fuel lines. The account of the rescue was logged as a successful, routine search and rescue mission. LT Lassen became the first Naval Aviator and fifth Navy man to be awarded the Medal of Honor (MOH) for bravery in Southeast Asia (SEA)/Vietnam. He was also only one of three Naval Aviators to be awarded the MOH in SEA (along with CAPT Michael J. Estocin, and RADM James Stockdale), and the only rotary wing Naval Aviator to be awarded the MOH in SEA. He remained in the Navy and retired in 1982 with the rank of Commander. He lived in Pensacola, Florida until his death from cancer in 1994. In 2001, the destroyer was commissioned and named in his honor. (posted on Home of Heroes.com) An SH-60 Seahawk was painted to commemorate his actions. ==Medal of Honor citation== Lassen (at left) and three other men shortly after receiving their Medals of Honor from President Lyndon B.
