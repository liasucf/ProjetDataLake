He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Tipperary South constituency from 1961 to 1997. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1981 to 1984.Profile of Se\u00e1n Treacy ==Political career== Author RM Douglas says that Treacy was a party member of fringe Fascist group Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe during the 1940s,Douglas, R. M. (2009). Architects of the Resurrection: Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe and the Fascist 'New Order' in Ireland. Manchester University Press. . p. 250 however, by the 1960s Treacy had moved to the ideological left, albeit he was still considered to be socially conservative. Treacy was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1961 general election, as a Labour Party TD for the Tipperary South constituency. He was re-elected there in seven subsequent elections, and returned automatically in three more owing to his having been elected by the D\u00e1il as Ceann Comhairle. He was elected to that office firstly after the 1973 general election for one term, then after the 1987 general election for three. He was expelled from the Labour Party in 1985 for voting against the family planning bill, which would have liberalised the sale of contraception in the Republic of Ireland, but was elected as an independent TD at the general election that year. He was a member of the Irish Presidential Commission during the presidential vacancies of 1974 and 1976. He served as an MEP from 1981 to 1984, replacing Eileen Desmond who resigned as an MEP when she was appointed Minister for Health and Social Welfare. Treacy retired from politics at the 1997 general election. He died in Waterford on 23 March 2018, at the age of 94. His funeral, which was attended by President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and former Minister Martin Mansergh, was held on 26 March 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1923 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Local councillors in South Tipperary Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Independent TDs Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:Presiding officers of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann Category:MEPs for the Republic of Ireland 1979\u20131984 Category:Labour Party (Ireland) MEPs ",
