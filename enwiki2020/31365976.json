    "text": "This timeline of events leading to the American Civil War is a chronologically ordered list of events and issues which historians recognize as origins and causes of the American Civil War. These events are roughly divided into two periods: the first encompasses the gradual build-up over many decades of the numerous social, economic, and political issues that ultimately contributed to the war's outbreak, and the second encompasses the five-month span following the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States in 1860 and culminating in the capture of Fort Sumter in April 1861. Scholars have identified many different causes for the war. Among the most polarizing of the underlying issues from which other proximate causes developed was whether the institution of slavery should be retained and even expanded to other territories or whether it should be contained and eventually abolished. Since the early colonial period, slavery had played a major role in the socioeconomic system of British North America and was recognized in the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the United States' Declaration of Independence in 1776. During and after the American Revolution, events and statements by politicians and others brought forth differences, tensions and divisions between citizens of the slave states of the Southern United States and citizens of the free states of the Northern United States (including several newly admitted Western states) over the topics of slavery. In the many decades between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, such divisions became increasingly irreconcilable and contentious.James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (1988), ch. 1\u20138. Events in the 1850s culminated with the election of the anti-slavery Republican Abraham Lincoln as president on November 6, 1860. This provoked the first round of state secession as leaders of the cotton states of the Deep South were unwilling to remain in what they perceived as a second-class political status, with their way of life now threatened by the President himself. Initially, seven states seceded: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. After the Confederates attacked and captured Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for volunteers to march south and suppress the rebellion. This pushed four other states in the Upper South (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas) also to secede, completing the incorporation of the Confederate States of America by July 1861. Their contributions of territory and soldiers to the Confederacy ensured the war would be prolonged and bloody. ==Colonial period, 1607\u20131775== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 |- |valign=center align=right|1619 | * A Dutch ship arrives in the British Colony of Virginia carrying about twenty black Africans as indentured servants.

The law no longer applies as soon as the territories become states. In the following years, anti-slavery Northerners cite the ordinance many times as precedent for the limitation, if not the abolition, of slavery in the United States.

It declared children of slaves born after July 4, 1799, to be legally free, but the children had to serve an extended period of indentured servitude: to the age of 28 for males and to 25 for females. Slaves born before that date were redefined as indentured servants but essentially continued as slaves for life.Wagner, 2009, p. 78 * George Washington dies on December 14, 1799.

At Jefferson's urging, Congress outlaws the international slave trade in an Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, whereby importing or exporting slaves becomes a federal crime, effective January 1, 1808; in 1820 it is made the crime of piracy. Previously about 14,000 new foreign-born slaves had arrived in the U.S. each year. This number is dramatically reduced following the new law, but illegal smuggling continues to bring in about 1,000 new slaves per year.Paul Finkelman, \"Regulating the African Slave Trade\", Civil War History Volume: 54#4 (2008), pp. 379+. During the debates, Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke warns that outlawing the slave trade might become the \"pretext of universal emancipation\" and further warns that it would \"blow up the constitution\". If ever there should be disunion, he prophesies, the line would be drawn between the states that did and those that did not hold slaves.Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the President: Second Term, 1805\u20131809 (1974), pp. 545\u20136. |- |valign=center align=right|1810 | * The U.S. slave population according to the 1810 United States Census is 27,510 slaves in the North and 1,191,364 in the South.Kiefer, Joseph Warren.

After the election, he reveals a plan to admit California and New Mexico to the Union as free states covering entire Southwest and to exclude slavery from any territories. Taylor warns the South that he will meet rebellion with force. His moderate views on the expansion of slavery and the acceptability of the Wilmot Proviso angered his unsuspecting Southern supporters but did not fully satisfy Northerners who wanted to limit or abolish slavery.Richard J.

Clay proposes (1) admission of California, (2) prohibition of Texas expansion into New Mexico, (3) compensation of $10 million to Texas to finance its public debt, (4) permission to citizens of New Mexico and Utah to vote on whether slavery would be allowed in their territories (popular sovereignty), (5) a ban of the slave trade in the District of Columbia; slavery would still be allowed in the district, and (6) a stronger fugitive slave law with more vigorous enforcement. * Under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, a slave owner could reclaim a runaway slave by establishing ownership before a commissioner rather than in a jury trial. Clay's initial omnibus bill that included all these provisions failed. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois then established different coalitions that passed each provision separately.Bruce Tap, \"Compromise of 1850\", in William B.

This abrogates the Missouri Compromise prohibition of slavery north of the 36\u00b030' line of latitude and increases Northerners' fears of a Slave Power encroaching on the North. Both Northerners and Southerners rush to the Kansas and Nebraska territories to express their opinion in the voting. Especially in Kansas, many voters are pro-slavery Missouri residents who enter Kansas simply to vote. * Opponents of slavery and the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act meet in Ripon, Wisconsin in February, and subsequently meet in other Northern states, to form the Republican Party. The party includes many former members of the Whig and Free Soil parties and some northern Democrats. Republicans win most of the Northern state seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the fall 1854 elections as 66 of 91 Northern state Democrats are defeated. Abraham Lincoln emerges as a Republican leader in the West (Illinois). * Eli Thayer forms the New England Emigrant Aid Society to encourage settlement of Kansas by persons opposed to slavery. * Bitter fighting breaks out in Kansas Territory as pro-slavery men win a majority of seats in the legislature, expel anti-slavery legislators and adopt the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for the proposed state of Kansas. * The Ostend Manifesto, a dispatch sent from France by the U.S. ministers to Britain, France and Spain after a meeting in Ostend, Belgium, describes the rationale for the United States to purchase Cuba (a territory which had slavery) from Spain and implies the U.S. should declare war if Spain refuses to sell the island. Four months after the dispatch is drafted, it is published in full at the request of the U.S. House of Representatives. Northern states view the document as a Southern attempt to extend slavery. European nations consider it as a threat to Spain and to Imperial power. The U.S. government never acts upon the recommendations in the Ostend Manifesto. * Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave from Virginia, is arrested by federal agents in Boston.

Over 95 percent of the pro-slavery votes in the election of a Kansas territorial legislature in 1855 are later determined to be fraudulent.McPherson, 1982, p. 92. * Anti-slavery Kansans draft the Topeka Constitution and elect a new legislature which actually represents the majority of legal voters.

This charge angers many Southerners.Klein, 1997, p. 57.Wagner, 2009, p. 66. * The U.S. Supreme Court reaches the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, a 7 to 2 ruling that Congress lacks the power to exclude slavery from the territories, that slaves are property and have no rights as citizens and that slaves are not made free by living in free territory. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney concludes that the Missouri Compromise is unconstitutional. If a court majority clearly agreed (which it did not in this decision), this conclusion would allow all territories to be open to slavery. Scott and his family were purchased and freed by a supporter's children. Northerners vowed to oppose the decision as in violation of a \"higher law\". Antagonism between the sections of the country increases.Don E. Fehrenbacher, Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective (1981). * Anti-slavery supporters in Kansas ignore a June election to a constitutional convention because less populous pro-slavery counties were given a majority of delegates. The convention adopts the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Meanwhile, anti-slavery representatives win control of the state legislature.Wagner, 2009, p. 64.Klein, 1997, p. 53. * August: The Panic of 1857 arises, mainly in large northern cities, as a result of speculation in and inflated values of railroad stocks and real estate. Southerners tout the small effect in their section as support for their economic and labor system.Wagner, 2009, p. 65. * Buchanan endorses the Lecompton constitution and breaks with Douglas, who regards the document as a mockery of popular sovereignty because its referendum provision does not offer a true free state option. A bitter feud begins inside the Democratic party. Douglas's opposition to the Lecompton constitution erodes his support from pro-slavery factions.McPherson, 1982, p. 108. * The Tariff of 1857, authored primarily by R. M. T.

In 1861, the Old School church splits along North\u2013South lines.Ramsey Coutta, Divine Institutions (2006), p. 153. * The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858 focus on issues and arguments that will dominate the Presidential election campaign of 1860. Pro-Douglas candidates win a small majority in the Illinois legislature in the general election and choose Douglas as U.S. Senator from Illinois for another term. However, Lincoln emerges as a nationally known moderate spokesman for Republicans and a moderate opponent of slavery.Allen C. Guelzo, Lincoln and Douglas: The debates that defined America (2008). * In a debate with Lincoln at Freeport, Illinois, Douglas expresses an opinion which becomes known as the \"Freeport Doctrine\". Lincoln asks whether the people of a territory could lawfully exclude slavery before the territory became a state. In effect, this question asks Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. Douglas says they could do so by refusing to pass the type of police regulations needed to sustain slavery. This answer further alienates pro-slavery advocates from Douglas. * Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina proclaims: \"No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is King; until lately the Bank of England was king; but she tried to put her screws, as usual...on the cotton crop, and was utterly vanquished\", which argues that even Europe is dependent on the cotton economy of the Southern states and would have to intervene in any U.S. conflict, even an internal threat, to protect its vital source of raw material, King Cotton.Drew Gilpin Faust, James Henry Hammond and the old South: A design for mastery (1985). * William Lowndes Yancey and Edmund Ruffin found the League of United Southerners. They advocate reopening the African slave trade and the formation of a Southern confederacy.McPherson, 1982, p. 110. * U.S. Senator William H. Seward says there is an \"irrepressible conflict\" between slavery and freedom. * Although solid evidence of their guilt is presented, the crew of the illegal slave ship The Wanderer is acquitted of engaging in the African slave trade by a Savannah, Georgia jury. Similarly, a Charleston, South Carolina jury acquits the crew of The Echo, another illegal slave ship which is caught with 320 Africans on board. |- |valign=center align=right|1859 | * Southerners block an increase in the low tariff rates of 1857.McPherson, 1982, p. 123. * February: U.S. Senator Albert G. Brown of Mississippi says that if a territory requires a slave code in line with Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, the federal government must pass a slave code to protect slavery in the territories. If it does not, Brown says he will urge Mississippi to secede from the Union. * Oregon is admitted to the Union as a free state, but prohibits the residency of any person of African origin, slave or free.McPherson, 1982, p. 80. * In Ableman v. Booth, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law is constitutional and that state courts cannot overrule federal court decisions.Potter, (1976), p. 295. * President Buchanan and Southern members of Congress, including Senator John Slidell of Louisiana, make another attempt to buy Cuba from Spain. Douglas supports the proposed annexation of Cuba. Republicans block funding.McPherson, 1982, p. 109. * Southern senators block a homestead act that would have given settlers in the West each 160 acres of land. * The Southern Commercial Convention endorses reopening the African slave trade to reduce the price of slaves and widen slaveholding. Many members think this would lessen feelings that the slave trade was immoral and provide an incentive or tool for Southern nationalism.Bowman, 1982, p. 39 * October 4: Kansas voters adopt the anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution by a 2-to-1 margin. * October 16: Kansas abolitionist John Brown attempts to spark a slave rebellion in Virginia through seizure of weapons from the federal armory at Harpers Ferry.Eicher, 2001, p. 45. Brown holds the arsenal for 36 hours. No slaves join him and no rebellion ensues but 17 persons, including 10 of Brown's men, are killed. Brown and his remaining men are captured by U.S. Marines led by Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee. Brown is tried for treason to the state of Virginia, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty of all charges. * November 2: John Brown is sentenced and delivers his famous \"last speech\". * The New Mexico Territory adopts a slave code, but no slaves are in the territory according to the 1860 census. * December 2: John Brown is hanged, in Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia).Bowman, 1982, pp. 39\u201340. Across the North it is treated as a national calamity; church bells are rung, rallies held, speeches and sermons given. Brown is seen as a martyr to the cause of ending slavery. Brown is seen in the South as a fanatical Yankee abolitionist trying to start a bloody race war, as well as stealing their property (the enslaved). The reaction in the North to his execution reinforces the Southern fear that more such raids would soon be coming. Secession, for which support had grown steadily since the Nullification Crisis of 1832\u201333, is believed by Southern leaders to be their only option.Klein, 1997, p. 58.Hansen, 1961, p. 25\u201327.McPherson, 1982, pp. 115\u2013117. * Members of the Congress which convenes in December insult, level charges at, threaten, and denounce each other. Members come to the sessions armed. The House of Representatives requires eight weeks to choose a Speaker. This delays consideration of vitally important business.Klein, 1997, p. 60.McPherson, 1982, pp. 112\u2013113. |- |valign=center align=right|1860 | * The U.S. slave population according to the 1860 United States Census is 3,954,174. The census also concludes that the total U.S. population has increased from 23,191,875 to 31,443,321 since the 1850 Census, an increase of 35.4 percent; 26 percent of all Northerners but only 10 percent of Southerners live in towns or cities; and that 80 percent of the Southern workforce but only 40 percent of the Northern workforce is employed in agriculture.Wagner, 2009, p. 74. * Southern opposition kills the Pacific Railway Bill of 1860.

Seward of New York, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, and Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania are leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, along with the more moderate Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, when the Republican convention convenes in Chicago. Lincoln supporters from Illinois skillfully gain commitments for Lincoln. On May 18, Lincoln wins the Republican Party nomination for president. The Republicans adopt a concrete, precise, and moderately worded platform which includes the exclusion of slavery from the territories but the affirmation of the right of states to order and control their own \"domestic institutions\".McPherson, 1982, pp. 119\u2013120. * June 18: The main group of Democrats meeting in Baltimore, bolstered by some new Douglas Democrats from Southern states who are seated to the exclusion of the Southern delegates from the previous session of the convention, nominate Douglas for President. * June 28: Southern Democrats nominate Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President. Their platform endorses a national slave code.McPherson, 1982, p. 120. * Honduran militia stop another filibuster effort by William Walker.
