    "text": "Hermanus or Hermannus Angelkot Jr. (bapt. 6 February 1688, Amsterdam \u2013 d. 1727) was an Amsterdam pharmacist who also wrote poems and plays. He was the son of Judith Muijsart and Hermanus Angelkot Sr. (ca. 1648 - ca. 1713), who also wrote plays and practised as a pharmacist. The sources often cite father and son interchangeably. Hermanus Jr. married Catharina te Naerde in Amsterdam before 1717. Angelkot Jr. was friendly with Pieter Langendijk who was the first to translate Moli\u00e8re into Dutch. Together they wrote Cato, of de ondergang der Roomsche vryheid (1715), based on Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1713), dedicating it to the then mayor of Amsterdam, Nicolaes Witsen. == Works == * Vechter * Het voutje van Esphesen * Cato, of de ondergang der Roomsche vryheid (1715, with Pieter Langendijk) == References == == External links == * Category:1688 births Category:1727 deaths Category:Dutch male poets Category:18th-century Dutch dramatists and playwrights Category:Dutch pharmacologists Category:Writers from Amsterdam Category:Dutch male dramatists and playwrights ",
