At the time of its opening, the station was located in the town of Shiki (later becoming the city of Shiki). In 1960, a new entrance was added on the south side of the station to improve accessibility for students of the Rikkyo High School (present-day Rikkyo Niiza Junior and Senior High School) which had recently relocated from Ikebukuro to Niiza, Saitama. In 1970, to further improve access to the school, the station was moved closer to Ikebukuro, moving it across the boundary from the city of Shiki into Niiza. While Niiza residents petitioned to have the station name changed, this never came about, and the name was used instead for Niiza Station on the Musashino Line, which opened in 1973.
