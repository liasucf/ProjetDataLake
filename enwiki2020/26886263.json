The Council then reemphasised the mandate of the Force and requested the Secretary-General to continue negotiations with the Government of Lebanon and other parties concerned with regard to the implementation of resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and report thereon. A recent number of attacks against UNIFIL were also condemned and all parties were urged to put an end to them. Measures relating to the streamlining of UNIFIL were agreed upon, stressing that the operational capacity of the Force would not be affected. == See also == * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000) ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1006 1006 Category:South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000) Category:1995 in Israel Category:1995 in Lebanon 1006 ",
