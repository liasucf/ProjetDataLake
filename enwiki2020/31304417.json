    "text": "The Green Bay Chill was a women's American football team in the Legends Football League (formerly Lingerie Football League) that played from 2011 to 2014. The Chill played in Green Bay, Wisconsin, at the Resch Center from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with home games at U.S. Cellular Arena. Their first game in the 2014 season was set to take place in the U.S. Cellular Arena but it was rescheduled to July 12 citing lack of ticket sales. The July 12 game was the only Chill game played at the arena. The team was coached by former Green Bay Packer lineman Gilbert Brown. ==2014 roster== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#213D30; border:2px solid #FFCC00; color:white; text- align:center\"| Green Bay Chill roster |- | style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical- align:top;\" | Quarterbacks * 10 Rykki Casey * 19 Anne Erler Running backs * Receivers * 1 Taylor Haywood * 2 Jessica Peyton * 5 Danielle Jorgenson * 7 Cassie Anderson * 9 Amber McLellan * 11 Laure Gelis * 13 Anna Heasman * 15 Hallie Jiskra * 17 Amber Mane * 18 Theresa Garay * 20 Stephanie Ponzer | style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Offensive Linewomen * 3 Jennifer Freund Defensive linewomen * 1 Taylor Haywood * 3 Jennifer Freund * 5 Danielle Jorgenson * 9 Amber McLellan * 15 Hallie Jiskra * 18 Theresa Garay | style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" | Linebackers * 10 Rykki Casey Cornerbacks * 7 Cassie Anderson * 13 Anna Heasman * 20 Stephanie Ponzer Safeties * 2 Jessica Peyton * 11 Laure Gelis * 17 Amber Mane * 19 Anne Erler Roster updated 2014-11-01 |} ==Schedules== ===2011\u20132012=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
