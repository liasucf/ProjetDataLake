    "text": "He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown is the fifth prime-time animated TV special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on February 14, 1968. ==Plot== Snoopy's persistent mischief is angering the other kids in the neighborhood, and they all demand that Charlie Brown do something about it because \"He's your dog, Charlie Brown!\" In a letter to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Charlie Brown writes that he is going to send Snoopy back for a refresher course in obedience. Snoopy loathes the idea, but Charlie Brown tells him it is for his own good. As it is a two-day trip, Charlie Brown calls Peppermint Patty and asks to let Snoopy stay there for one night en route; Peppermint Patty agrees, but a scheming Snoopy decides to stay on and has Peppermint Patty waiting on him hand and foot, which confuses her. A week later, the Puppy Farm calls and informs Charlie Brown that Snoopy never showed up. When he finds out that he is still at Peppermint Patty's house, Charlie Brown goes over to her house with a leash to take Snoopy home, but the dog escapes and runs back. Peppermint Patty lets Snoopy stay, but instead of returning to the easy life he enjoyed before, Peppermint Patty puts him to work doing menial chores. Later, when Lucy and Linus both start to miss Snoopy, Charlie Brown tries again to bring him home, but Snoopy breaks the leash and sends Charlie Brown away. That night, while doing dishes, Snoopy becomes infuriated and angrily starts breaking dishes, and Peppermint Patty puts him in the garage as punishment. While there, Snoopy realizes that he had a better life at home and starts to howl incessantly. When Patty comes out to check on him, he knocks her down, gathers all his belongings from inside the house and runs back home to an overjoyed Charlie Brown. The next day, after taking Linus on a wild blanket ride and picking a fight with Lucy, the gang is also glad that Snoopy is back. Contented, Snoopy goes to nap on his dog house. ==Cast== *Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown *Bill Melendez as Snoopy *Sally Dryer as Lucy van Pelt *Christopher Shea as Linus van Pelt *Gail DeFaria as Peppermint Patty *Glenn Mendelson as Schroeder *Ann Altieri as Violet *Lisa DeFaria as Patty *Matthew Liftin as 5 Sally Brown, Frieda and Pig-Pen do not appear.
