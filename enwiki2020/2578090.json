    "text": "Way of the Tiger 1: Avenger! The Way of the Tiger is a series of adventure gamebooks by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson set on the fantasy world of Orb. The reader takes the part of a young monk/ninja, Avenger, initially on a quest to avenge his foster father and recover stolen scrolls. Later books presented other challenges for Avenger to overcome, most notably taking over and ruling a city. The world of Orb was originally created by Mark Smith for a Dungeons and Dragons game he ran while a pupil at Brighton College in the mid-1970s. Orb was also used as the setting for the Fighting Fantasy gamebook Talisman of Death, again by Smith & Thomson. Each book has a disclaimer at the front against performing any of the ninja related feats in the book as \"They could lead to serious injury or death to an untrained user\". The sixth book, Inferno!, ends on a cliffhanger with Avenger trapped in the web of the Black Widow, Orb's darkest blight. As no new books were released, the fate of Avenger and Orb was unknown. Mark Smith has confirmed that the cliffhanger ending was deliberate. In August 2013, the original creators of the series were working with Megara Entertainment to develop re-edited hardcover collector editions of the gamebooks (including a new prequel (Book 0) and sequel (book 7)), and potentially a role-playing game based on the series. The two new books plus the six re-edited original books were reprinted in paperback format by Megara Entertainment in 2014, and made available as PDFs in 2019. In December 2013, it was announced that Tin Man Games would be releasing the original six books of the series on digital platforms in 2014 and 2015. However, as of 2017, nothing has been released. ==Books== The original series comprises six books: # Avenger! # Assassin! # Usurper! # Overlord! # Warbringer! # Inferno! ==Original covers== File:Wayofthetiger book1.jpg|Avenger! The books could be played in sequence or as standalone adventures, although playing them in sequence preserves the continuity of the storyline. If played in sequence, any abilities, bonuses, penalties or special items Avenger had acquired carried over to the next book. The expanded eight- book series consists of the following titles (the first and the last having been printed many years after the original six): # * Ninja! by David Walters #Avenger! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Assassin! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Usurper! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Overlord! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Warbringer! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Inferno! by Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson #Redeemer! by David Walters, Mark Smith & Jamie Thomson ==Features== The series featured a combat system based on unarmed fighting moves with colourful names, such as the Cobra Strike punch, or Leaping Tiger kick. Avenger could also choose from a list of ninja skills such as Acrobatics or Poison Needle spitting, and used a variety of appropriate weaponry, such as a garotte and shuriken. Luck also played in part in the form of Fate tests to see if Fate smiled on you, or turned her back. Avenger could also enhance his skill by using \"Inner Force\", similar to qi energy. During the series Avenger could learn new skills, such as \"Shinren,\" a means of understanding people's intentions by observing subtle clues. ==Characters== The books had a large number of opponents and recurring characters. ===Enemies=== *Tyutchev, Cassandra and Thaum - A trio of chaos worshippers, who revere the chaos god Anarchil. They are recurring antagonists of Avenger throughout the series. Those three characters are also featured in Fighting Fantasy book 11, Talisman of Death, where they oppose the player for the titular item. **Cassandra - A warrior noted for her beauty, speed and swordsmanship. Wields a magical coldsword and wears a patchwork armor suit. **Tyutchev - This thief wears a magical cloak that blends with the dark, and wields a bastard sword taller than he is. His hair is dyed a bright corn yellow. **Thaum - a master of magic and especially illusion. \"Devious looking\" and wears a large gold earring. *Olvar the Chaos Bringer - A chaos-worshipping barbarian warrior and friend of Tyutchev, Cassandra and Thaum. His death at Avenger's hands (after an unprovoked attack by Olvar) leads to the feud between Avenger and the chaos worshippers. Wears a magical headband that can fire lightning bolts, and feels no pain in combat due to his bloodlust. *The Monks of the Scarlet Mantis - An order of evil monks who worship Vile, Kwon's evil brother. Like the followers of Kwon, the members of the Scarlet Mantis are consummate martial artists. **Yaemon, the Grand Master of Flame - Head of the Monks of the Scarlet Mantis, an order of monks opposed to the monks who follow Kwon. At the beginning of the series he has been Grand Master for more than twenty summers. He slew Avenger's foster father Naijishi and stole the Scrolls of Kettsuin. Possibly the most deadly martial artist on Orb, Yaemon is allied to Manse the Deathmage and Honoric, the leader of the Legion of the Sword of Doom and in the first book, Avenger, your quest calls for you to defeat Yaemon and so avenge the death of your father. **Aiguchi the Weaponmaster - A monk of the Scarlet Mantis and a master of weapons, he challenges Avenger to a duel in the Ring of Vasch-Ro to avenge the death of Yaemon.

A peerless swordsman, it is said he once slew a storm giant singlehandedly.

Unlike the disciples of the Tiger, the Scorpion Ninja specialize in the use of various weapons. **The Grandmaster of Shadows - The leader of the ninja who follow the Way of the Scorpion. Uses deception, trickery and his ability to create magical darkness in combat. **The Impostor - A Scorpion Ninja who is sent to Irsmuncast to establish a rule of evil while Avenger is absent on a quest in the Rift.

He is murdered by Mandrake, and his likeness adapted by the assassin in an attempt on Avenger's life. **Aiko - A female ninja like Avenger, and a contestant for the title Grandmaster of the Five Winds in Ninja.

The first, The Way of the Tiger, is a beat 'em up released by Gremlin Graphics for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX , Commodore 16 and Commodore 64. This game has Avenger fighting with staves and swords as well as utilizing unarmed combat (Avenger rarely used weapons apart from shuriken in the books). Way of the Tiger II: Avenger is an action-adventure made by Gremlin Graphics in 1986, for the computers Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and MSX. In the game's story, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame has killed the player's foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin. To recover the scrolls, the player has to find enough keys to penetrate the Quench Heart Keep, and then kill each of the three guards. The game is viewed from top-down perspective and superficially resembles Gauntlet. ==Reception== Chris Elliott reviewed Assassin! and Avenger!' for White Dwarf #71, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \"Plot and atmosphere may be a bit 'Kung Fu meets AD&D;', but both add a few new twists to the adventure gamebook formula, and deserve credit for that. Overall, good entertainment value.\" ==See also== *Choose Your Own Adventure *Fighting Fantasy, Advanced Fighting Fantasy *Legends of Skyfall *Lone Wolf ==References== ==External links== ===Book related=== *Megara Entertainment *Way of the Tiger at gamebooks.org ===Video game related=== *Way of the Tiger at World of Spectrum * Avenger at GameBase64 * * Avenger at Ready64 Category:Books by Mark Smith (author) Category:Books by Jamie Thomson Category:Fantasy gamebooks Category:Gamebooks Category:Ninja in fiction Category:Series of books Category:1986 video games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:MSX games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ",
