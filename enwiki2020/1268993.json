    "text": "Unicase and cased glottal-stop letters The character , called glottal stop, is an alphabetic letter in some Latin alphabets, most notable in several languages of Canada where it indicates a glottal stop sound. Such usage derives from phonetic transcription, for example the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), that use this letter for the glottal stop sound. The letter derives graphically from use of the apostrophe for glottal stop. ==Graphic variants== Road sign in British Columbia showing the use of the digit to represent in the Squamish language. Where is not available, not being in the basic Latin alphabet, it is sometimes replaced by a question mark , which is its official representation in the SAMPA transcription scheme. In Skwomesh or Squamish, may be replaced by the digit (see image at right). In Unicode, four graphic variants of the glottal stop letter are available. *Unicase () is provided for the International Phonetic Alphabet and Americanist phonetic notation. It is found in a number of orthographies that use the IPA/APA symbol, such as those of several Salishan languages. *A case pair, uppercase () and lowercase (), is provided for the orthographies of several Athabaskan languages. Uppercase may be slightly wider than unicase in fonts that distinguish them. *Superscript () that is used in the IPA and the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. Other common symbols for the glottal stop sound are variants of the punctuation mark apostrophe that was the historical basis of the glottal stop letters. These include the 9-shaped modifier letter apostrophe, , which is probably the most common (and the direct ancestor of ), the 6-shaped \u02bbokina of Hawaiian, , and the straight-apostrophe shaped saltillo of many languages of Mexico, which has the case forms . ==Usage== ===Technical transcription=== *Americanist phonetic notation and the International Phonetic Alphabet \u2014 unicase \u0294 or superscript \u02c0 *Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages \u2014 occasionally unicase \u0294 *Uralic Phonetic Alphabet \u2014 superscript \u02c0 only ===Vernacular orthographies=== *Languages of Canada **Chipewyan \u2014 uppercase \u0241 and lowercase \u0242 **Dogrib \u2014 uppercase \u0241 and lowercase \u0242 **Kootenai \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Musqueam language \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Nootka \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Slavey \u2014 uppercase \u0241 and lowercase \u0242 **Nitinaht \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Thompson \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Lushootseed \u2014 unicase \u0294 **Squamish language, where it is sometimes represented with . == Computing codes == In Unicode 1.0, only the unicase and superscript variants were included. In version 4.1 (2005), an uppercase character was added, and the existing unicase character was redefined as its lowercase. Then, in version 5.0 (2006), it was decided to separate the cased and caseless usages by adding a dedicated lowercase letter. The IPA character is first from left, while the extended Latin alphabet characters are third and fourth from left. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right |- align=center !
