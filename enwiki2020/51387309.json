It is located in the Santo Cristo neighborhood near the Gamboa waterfront area of the city. It was designed by L\u00facio Costa (1902-1998) in 1931 during his three-year partnership with Gregori Warchavchik, and completed in 1933. The goal of modernists in Brazil was to build for the working class, and Vila Oper\u00e1ria Gamboa is the first modernist building constructed for the poor in Brazil. Vila Oper\u00e1ria da Gamboa was built on a narrow, irregular parcel of land. It is located on the north side of Rua Bar\u00e3o da Gamboa at the intersection of Rua Cardoso Marinho on land ceded to the project by Dr. F\u00e1bio Carneiro de Mendo\u00e7a. The technology for modern construction was at an early stage in Brazil and workers in Rio de Janeiro lacked the technical skills to work with concrete, steel, and stone. Warchavchik brought workers from his modernist projects in S\u00e3o Paulo to complete the building. The structure consists of fourteen units on two floor. Twelve were full apartments of with a living room and two bedrooms. Two were simple studio apartments of , and were meant to serve as homes for the \"concierges\" or janitors of the building. The fa\u00e7ade of the building was painted in vivid green and tan with the walkway banister painted in white. In its style it resembles early 20th-century residences of Louis Bourgeois and Cliff May. Vila Oper\u00e1ria da Gamboa remains standing but is in a state of advanced dilapidation. It is a listed building of the City of Rio de Janeiro (Bens Tombados No Munic\u00edpio Do Rio De Janeiro), designated as such in 1986. ==References== Category:Apartment buildings Category:L\u00facio Costa buildings Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1933 Category:Modernist architecture in Brazil Category:1933 establishments in Brazil ",
