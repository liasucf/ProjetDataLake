In 1997, he coached the Vermont Voltage of the USISL D-3 Pro League. In 2000, he was appointed the head coach of the Montreal Impact of the USL A-League. With Montreal he brought in Darko Koli\u0107, Dejan Glu\u0161\u010devi\u0107, and several younger players like future Canadian international Patrice Bernier. After four matches he was dismissed from his position due to a poor start to the season. On March 26, 2001, Jankovic was signed as the head coach of the newly formed Montreal Dynamites of the Canadian Professional Soccer League. He brought many of his former Montreal Impact signings of the previous year. With the Dynamites he led his team to a fourth-place finish in the overall standings, thus qualifying for the playoffs. In the playoffs the Dynamites faced St. Catharines Wolves, but were defeated by a score of 2-1 with the lone goal coming from Kyriakos Selaidopolous. For his efforts he received the CPSL Coach of the Year award. In 2002, Jankovic resigned from his position to become the head coach of the ARSL (Association Regionale de Soccer des Laurentides). == References == Category:Living people Category:Yugoslav football managers Category:Soccer people from Quebec Category:Montreal Impact (1992\u20132011) coaches Category:Canadian Professional Soccer League (1998-2005) managers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
