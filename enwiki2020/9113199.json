The Axis of the Good', February 28, 2012, accessed on October 6 , 2020 (first published in Swiss Month , issue 994, March 2012 (paid access)) ==Trademarks== Piet Klocke's trademark role is Professor Schmitt-Hindemith in his show \"Musikstilarten im auslaufenden Jahrtausend\" (Music styles of the Ending Millennium), where he is accompanied by saxophonist Simone Sonnenschein as Fr\u00e4ulein Angelika Kleinknecht. As Profession Schmitt-Hindemith, Klocke dresses eccentrically, and uses his scrubby red hair and lean figure to create an image of a helplessly nervous person, speaking in a very distracted way and leaving most of his sentences unfinished. He also often employs the Schmitt- Hindemith character in radio plays. ==Discography== * HipHop f\u00fcr Angestellte (ein musikalischer Abschlu\u00dfabend in der VHS) (1995) * Das geht alles von Ihrer Zeit ab (1997) * Abenteuer im Dioptrinanzug (2000) * Puffy Egborn 2 oder Scheitern als Weg!
