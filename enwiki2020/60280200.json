    "text": "Prudence Punderson Rossiter (July 28, 1758 \u2013 September 16, 1784) was an American artist known for her needlework pictures. ==Birth and family== Originally from Preston, Connecticut, Rossiter was the first of eight children of Ebenezer Punderson and Prudence Geer Punderson; her father was a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, and as a result the family's goods were confiscated in 1778. The Pundersons fled to Long Island, where they lived in reduced circumstances for the duration of the war. ==Work and illness== Prudence turned to domestic work to earn money. In 1780 she overcame a severe illness that threatened her artistic ability; a letter to her sister from this time survives, speaking of a \"gathering\" on her breast that required lancing. ==Marriage and death== On October 20, 1783, she married Timothy Wells Rossiter; their daughter Sophia was born on July 18, 1784, and Prudence died on September 16 of the same year. She was interred in the Maple Cemetery in Berlin, Connecticut. ==Art== Rossiter produced a number of needlework pictures, including twelve depictions of the twelve apostles inspired by print sources. She is best known, however, for the self-portrait The First, Second, and Last Scene of Morality, completed around 1775. This work portrays a young woman, the artist herself, seated at a table in a finely-furnished parlor. To one side is a baby in a cradle, being cared for by a black servant. To the other is a coffin, marked \"PP\", sitting on a table. The piece is owned by the Connecticut Historical Society. The same organization owns her other needlework pieces as well as her letters, poetry, drawings, and diary. They provide a rare glimpse into the life of a young woman of the period. Rossiter's embroidery is the most-reproduced piece in the Society's collection. Elements of Rossiter's art have been incorporated into the work of artist Kiki Smith. Her needlework has been discussed by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. ==References== Category:1758 births Category:1784 deaths Category:Needlework Category:American textile artists Category:18th-century American women artists Category:18th-century American artists Category:People from Preston, Connecticut Category:Artists from Connecticut Category:18th- century women textile artists Category:18th-century textile artists ",
