    "text": "Tilllate, formerly M8 (named after the M8 motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow), is a dance music, club culture and lifestyle magazine. Formerly printed, it is now an online magazine with the option to print. It was established in Scotland in 1988. Its demographic is 18- to 25-year-olds, and it includes fashion stories and artist interviews, club or technology reviews, and coverage of current and predicted trends. The magazine has hosted parties in locations such as Miami, New York City, Ibiza, Singapore, Thailand, Sydney, Beijing, and Dubai. It has relationships with brands, labels and clubs worldwide, and many of its staff are established club DJs. Formerly known as M8 Magazine, the magazine acquired the social networking site tilllate.com and so the magazine was rebranded tilllate in August 2009.http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode;=1038392&c;=1http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-dance- mag-m8-buying-titillate.com-for-webprint-play/ M8 magazine was founded by David Faulds in September 1988. As publisher, Faulds appointed numerous successful editors including Mickey McMonagle, now Features Editor at Sunday Mail, Lesley Wright who later edited DJ Mag and Iain Thomson who now runs Essential Ibiza.

In June 2011 Tilllate launched a USA edition, which is now edited by Wilf Ligbott. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1988 establishments in Scotland Category:Dance music magazines Category:Magazines established in 1988 Category:Magazines published in Scotland Category:Mass media in Edinburgh Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Rave culture in the United Kingdom ",
