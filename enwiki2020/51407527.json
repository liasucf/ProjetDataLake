    "text": "The second season of the black comedy slasher television series Scream Queens aired on Fox. Fox renewed the series for a second season on January 15, 2016. It premiered on September 20, 2016 and concluded on December 20, 2016. The season consists of 10 episodes. Emma Roberts, Abigail Breslin, Billie Lourd, Lea Michele, Keke Palmer, Niecy Nash, Glen Powell, Oliver Hudson and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the previous season. John Stamos, Taylor Lautner, James Earl and Kirstie Alley were added to the main cast. Unlike the first season, which took place in a sorority house, the second season takes place in a hospital. On May 15, 2017, Fox announced the cancellation of the series, making this the final season of the show until Ryan Murphy announced that a third season had begun production in May 2020. ==Plot== After the events at Wallace University, Dean Cathy Munsch becomes a global icon and purchases the C.U.R.E. Institute in order to reform America's health care system and to cure incurable diseases. Hester confesses her crimes, leading to the Chanels' release from prison. However, the Chanels remain hated in the nation. Cathy then casts two doctors \u2014 Dr. Cassidy Cascade and Dr. Brock Holt \u2014 to fulfill the mission of the hospital, and installs Zayday Williams and the Chanels as medical students. Meanwhile, flashbacks to 1985 show the hospital's dark past, as a new serial killer surfaces: the Green Meanie. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Emma Roberts as Chanel Oberlin * Kirstie Alley as Nurse Ingrid Hoffel * Taylor Lautner as Dr. Cassidy Cascade * Lea Michele as Hester Ulrich / Chanel #6 * Abigail Breslin as Libby Putney / Chanel #5 * Keke Palmer as Zayday Williams * Billie Lourd as Sadie Swenson / Chanel #3 * James Earl as Chamberlain Jackson * John Stamos as Dr. Brock Holt * Jamie Lee Curtis as Dr. Cathy Munsch ===Special guest stars=== * Niecy Nash as Denise Hemphill * Colton Haynes as Tyler * Brooke Shields as Dr. Scarlett Lovin ===Recurring=== * Glen Powell as Chad Radwell * Oliver Hudson as Weston \"Wes\" Gardner * Trilby Glover as Jane Hollis * Jerry O'Connell as Dr. Mike * Laura Bell Bundy as Nurse Thomas * Andy Erikson as Marguerite Honeywell / Chanel #7 * Riley McKenna Weinstein as Daria Janssen / Chanel #8 * Dahlya Glick as Andrea / Chanel #10 ===Guest=== * Jeremy Batiste as Bill Hollis * Cecily Strong as Catherine Hobart * Kevin Bigley as Randal * Brian Baumgartner as Richard * Cheri Oteri as Sheila Baumgartner * Alec Mapa as Lynn Johnstone * Ivar Brogger as Mitch Mitchum * Mary Birdsong as Penelope Hotchkiss * Pablo Castelblanco as Tristan St. Pierre / Chanel Pour Homme * Moira O'Neill as Addison / Chanel #9 * Cathy Marks as Midge / Chanel #11 * Amy Okuda as Anna Plaisance * Ray Fega as Slade Hornborn * Bill Oberst Jr. as Clark ==Episodes== ==Casting== In June 2016, John Stamos, Taylor Lautner and James Earl joined the cast of the series, portraying doctors and an employee at the hospital, respectively.
