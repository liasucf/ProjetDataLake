    "text": "The Ohnesorge number (Oh) is a dimensionless number that relates the viscous forces to inertial and surface tension forces. The number was defined by Wolfgang von Ohnesorge in his 1936 doctoral thesis. It is defined as: : \\mathrm{Oh} = \\frac{ \\mu}{ \\sqrt{\\rho \\sigma L }} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{We}}}{\\mathrm{Re}} \\sim \\frac{\\mbox{viscous forces}}{\\sqrt{{\\mbox{inertia}} \\cdot {\\mbox{surface tension}}}} Where * \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid * \u03c1 is the density of the liquid * \u03c3 is the surface tension * L is the characteristic length scale (typically drop diameter) * Re is the Reynolds number * We is the Weber number ==Applications== The Ohnesorge number for a 3 mm diameter rain drop is typically ~0.002. Larger Ohnesorge numbers indicate a greater influence of the viscosity. This is often used to relate to free surface fluid dynamics such as dispersion of liquids in gases and in spray technology. English translation: In inkjet printing, liquids whose Ohnesorge number is less than 1 and greater than 0.1 are jettable (1 ==See also== * Laplace number - There is an inverse relationship, \\mathrm{Oh} = 1/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{La}}, between the Laplace number and the Ohnesorge number. It is more historically correct to use the Ohnesorge number, but often mathematically neater to use the Laplace number. ==References== Category:Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics Category:Fluid dynamics ",
