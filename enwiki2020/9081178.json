It is situated adjacent to Qawra, and it is a popular tourist resort, containing numerous hotels, restaurants, pubs, clubs, and a casino. ==History== During the Tarxien phase of Maltese prehistory, a small temple was built in what is now Bu\u0121ibba. The temple was excavated between the 1920s and 1950s, and it is now located in the grounds of a hotel. In around 1715, the Order of St. John built Bu\u0121ibba Battery as part of a series of fortifications defending Malta's coastline. Today, only remains of its foundations and ditch have survived. In the 1960s, Bu\u0121ibba began to see rapid development, and it is now a popular tourist resort. It is especially popular among students who go to Malta to learn English. The town's main highlight is the main square, which is located along the promenade. The area is full of nightclubs, bars and restaurants. Bugibba is a summer residence for the President Emeritus, George Abela, and Ex-Prime Minister & President Emeritus Dr. Edward Fenech Adami. ==References== Category:Towns in Malta Category:St. Paul's Bay ",
