The Modernizers: overseas students, foreign employees, and Meiji Japan, p. 47. Narisawa was born in Edo as the 22nd son of Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ienari. His mother was a concubine, Ohachi no Kata (later known as Honrin'in; d. 1850). His childhood name was Taminosuke (\u6c11\u4e4b\u52a9) or Sensabur\u014d (\u5343\u4e09\u90ce) In 1835, when Matsudaira Naritsugu (who was his brother-in- law from his sister, Asahime) died without an heir, he was chosen by the shogunate to become daimy\u014d of Fukui Domain. At that time, his court rank was raised from Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade to Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and he was granted the courtesy title of Echizen-no-kami. This was raised to Sakon'e-no-ch\u016bj\u014d in 1837. He had poor health since childhood. He departed Edo for his domain in June 1838, but died shortly after reaching Fukui in September of the same year. Under most circumstances, this would have been cause for attainder of the domain; however, through the quick intervention of Asahime, a cousin (Matsudaira Shungaku) was chosen as his posthumous successor, and the official date of Narisawa's death was changed to show that a successor had been appointed before he died. During the short period that he was daimy\u014d, Narisawa had no impact on domain affairs. The domain made an official petition to have its kokudaka raised in 1835 due to financial difficulties and its 900,000 ry\u014d debt, but this petition was refused. In 1837, the domain's Edo residence burned down, and was 20,000 ry\u014d loan was obtained from the shogunate for its reconstruction. The same year, a crop failure in Fukui resulted in another 10,000 ry\u014d loan, and a further 20,000 ry\u014d was extended the following year for Asahime's retirement residence. ==External links== * \"Fukui\" at Edo 300 * \u8d8a\u524d\u677e\u5e73\u6c0f (Echizen Matsudaira) at ReichsArchiv.jp ==Notes== Category:1820 births Category:1838 deaths Category:Shinpan daimyo Category:Fukui-Matsudaira clan Category:Tokugawa clan Category:People of Edo- period Japan ",
