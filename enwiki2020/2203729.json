Marie and from Chapleau. Franz once had a booming economy in forestry, transportation and mining. The community's original name was Hobon. In 1914, the post office's name was changed to Franz, and the railway station was renamed from Hobon to Franz Station after former Algoma Steel executive William Charles Franz.

When the Cline mine opened, Goudreau sprang to life with some 200 residents coming to the area to work. Not all of the residents worked in the mine, some of them were prospectors in search of the gold, silver, copper and iron pyrite. During the First World War, the mine was leased to the Nichols Chemicals company for the production of sulphuric acid. After the war ended, the market fell and the mine ceased operations. Other mines soon set up operations in the area. They went by the names of The Emily, Algold, Algoma Summit and The Edward. Each mine had a town site for their employees. The town continued to grow, with the building of a two-storey railway station, workers homes and a movie theatre. A post office was built in 1915 and closed in 1966. The Second World War ultimately led to Goudreau's demise as the demand for gold came second to iron and steel for the war. The mines eventually closed down as costs increased. Located along Highway 519, Goudreau is now a virtual ghost town, still used for logging operations and summer homes. === Goulais Mission === === Hale === ===Harmony Bay=== Harmony Bay is a small community built around a beach on Lake Superior. === Havilland Bay === Havilland Bay is a small unincorporated community built around a beach on Lake Superior. === Horsey === === Island Lake === === Kennedy === === Leeburn === Leeburn Leeburn () is located along Highway 638.

It is centered at the intersection of the east-west and north-south portions of Highway 638. Non-native settlers began farming in the area around the time the mines of Bruce Mines closed in 1875. In November, 1889, William Moor, a farmer prospecting after the fall harvest, found ore containing gold atop a ridge overlooking what was then Lake Ickta (now Havilah Lake). After some ownership dispute, American investors organized the Ophir Gold Mining Company (named after the biblical Ophir) to purchase the land in 1892. A small mining town was built, and gold mining operations commenced in 1893, producing 2489 tons of ore worth $8459. Operations ceased due to a financial panic in the United States and a fatal mining accident. The name of the mine and lake were changed to Havilah, another biblical reference, as mining resumed from 1910 to 1911, but the operation and its buildings were subsequently abandoned Third Report of the Bureau of Mines, 1893.Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Mines, 1910Forty-fifth Annual Report of the Ontario Department of Mines === Parkinson === === Poplar Dale === North of Ophir, this region was settled in the late 19th century for primarily agricultural reasons.
