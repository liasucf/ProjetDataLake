    "text": "The 2009-10 National League 1, previously known as National Division 2, is the first season of the third division of the English rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced with widespread league changes made by the RFU. As the new second division would reduce teams from 16 to 12, there were plenty of new additions to National League 1, itself increasing from 14 to 16 teams, with Esher, Newbury, Manchester, Manchester and Sedgley Park all dropping down from the old National 1 while Nuneaton and London Scottish came up from the 2008\u201309 National Division Three North and 2008\u201309 National Division Three South respectively (these divisions themselves now renamed National League 2 North/South). At the end of the season Esher finished as champions, way ahead of runners up and newly promoted London Scottish, suffering only one defeat and going straight back up to the 2010\u201311 RFU Championship. At the other end of the table, Manchester had an absolutely awful season, suffering their second successive relegation, with no wins, no bonus points, only 114 points scored and over 2,500 points conceded. The other two sides to join them would be Nuneaton who went straight back down after one season and Newbury Blues who also suffered a second relegation in a row, losing out to 13th place Otley by just 2 points. Manchester and Nuneaton would drop to the 2010\u201311 National League 2 North while Newbury would go down into the 2010\u201311 National League 2 South. ==Participating teams and locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Stadium !Capacity !City/Area |- |Blackheath |Rectory Field |6,000 |Blackheath, London |- |Blaydon |Crow Trees |2,000 (400 seats) |Swalwell, Tyne and Wear |- |Cambridge |Grantchester Road |1,250 (200 seats) |Cambridge, Cambridgeshire |- |Cinderford |Dockham Road |2,500 |Cinderford, Gloucestershire |- |Esher |Molesey Road |3,000 (1,200 seats) |Hersham, Surrey |- |Launceston |Polson Bridge |3,000 |Launceston, Cornwall |- |London Scottish |Athletic Ground |4,500 (1,000 seats) |Richmond, London |- |Manchester |Grove Park |4,000 |Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester |- |Newbury Blues |Monk's Lane |8,000 |Newbury, Berkshire |- |Nuneaton |Liberty Way |4,314 (514 Seated) |Nuneaton, Warwickshire |- |Otley |Cross Green |5,000 |Otley, West Yorkshire |- |Redruth |The Recreation Ground |3,500 (580 seats) |Redruth, Cornwall |- |Sedgley Park |Park Lane |3,000 |Whitefield, Greater Manchester |- |Stourbridge |Stourton Park |3,500 (499 seats) |Stourbridge, West Midlands |- |Tynedale |Tynedale Park |2,000 (400 seats) |Corbridge, Northumberland |- |Wharfedale |The Avenue |2,000 |Threshfield, Craven, North Yorkshire |- |} ==League table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|2009\u201310 National League 1 table |- |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"| |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"195\"|Club |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Played |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Won |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Drawn |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Lost |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points For |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Against |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Difference |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Try Bonus |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Losing Bonus |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text-align:center;\" | 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Esher (C) || 29 || 28 || 0 || 1 || 1416 || 338 || 1078 || 22 || 1 || 135 |- | 2 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | London Scottish || 30 || 22 || 1 || 7 || 938 || 569 || 369 || 15 || 3 || 108 |- | 3 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Launceston || 30 || 21 || 0 || 9 || 848 || 606 || 242 || 17 || 4 || 105 |- | 4 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cambridge || 30 || 19 || 1 || 10 || 880 || 572 || 308 || 14 || 5 || 97 |- | 5 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Tynedale || 30 || 18 || 1 || 11 || 1008 || 629 || 379 || 17 || 5 || 96 |- | 6 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wharfedale || 30 || 18 || 0 || 12 || 857 || 666 || 191 || 14 || 5 || 91 |- | 7 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Blaydon || 30 || 16 || 0 || 14 || 924 || 679 || 245 || 12 || 4 || 80 |- | 8 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Blackheath || 30 || 14 || 1 || 15 || 760 || 730 || 30 || 10 || 5 || 73 |- | 9 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Sedgley Park || 30 || 13 || 0 || 17 || 827 || 807 || 20 || 11 || 8 || 71 |- | 10 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Stourbridge || 30 || 13 || 0 || 17 || 751 || 799 || -48 || 12 || 6 || 70 |- | 11 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Redruth || 30 || 12 || 1 || 17 || 675 || 575 || 100 || 10 || 9 || 69 |- | 12 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cinderford || 29 || 12 || 0 || 17 || 753 || 636 || 117 || 10 || 8 || 66 |- | 13 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Otley || 30 || 12 || 1 || 17 || 710 || 811 || -101 || 9 || 4 || 63 |-style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;text-align:center;\" | 14 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Newbury (R) || 30 || 12 || 0 || 18 || 671 || 745 || -74 || 6 || 7 || 61 |-style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;text- align:center;\" | 15 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Nuneaton (R) || 30 || 6 || 0 || 24 || 559 || 903 || -344 || 4 || 4 || 32 |-style=\"background- color:#ffcccc;text-align:center;\" | 16 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Manchester (R) || 30 || 0 || 0 || 30 || 114 || 2626 || -2512 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- |colspan=\"15\"| *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Difference between points for and against # Total number of points for # Aggregate number of points scored in matches between tied teams # Number of matches won excluding the first match, then the second and so on until the tie is settled |- |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background is the promotion place.
