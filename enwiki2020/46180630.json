Later she went into exile in Mexico. ==Early years== Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola Miret was born in Huesca, Aragon on 3 September 1907 in her parents' home on calle Vega Armijo. Her father was a science assistant at the Huesca teachers' training college, and from 1923 owned a private school on Calle de Santa Paciencia. Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola was able to study at the Faculty of Sciences of the Central University of Madrid from 1925 to 1929, which was unusual for a woman at the time. She then moved to Barcelona, where she majored in Teaching. While in Barcelona in 1930 she joined the Spanish Communist Party. Before that she belonged to Rebeli\u00f3n, a group of young and independent socialists that included Navarro Ballesteros and Fern\u00e1ndez Checa. They joined the PCE, as did the Party of the Revolutionary and Anti-Imperialist Left of C\u00e9sar Falc\u00f3n and Graco Marsal. ==Career== After completing her academic training in 1933 Fuyola began teaching and also became an official in the auxiliary postal service. During these years she was involved in the Federation of Education Workers (FETE: Federaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de la Ense\u00f1anza). Her commitment to Communist ideals and her political abilities led to her being proposed by her comrades as candidate for Huesca and Zaragoza in the election of deputies to the Cortes in November 1933. She did poorly, but became known as a leading Communist in the region. She, Luc\u00eda Bar\u00f3n and Irene Falc\u00f3n launched the publication \u00a1Compa\u00f1era!, the organ of working women in the towns and country. In mid-1933 the World Committee Against War and Fascism sent a delegation to Spain to contact women interesting in forming a local branch. Fuyola joined the newly formed National Committee of Women Against War and Fascism, as did Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, Luc\u00eda Bar\u00f3n and Irene Falc\u00f3n. They contacted Republican and Socialist women through the Socialist deputy and well-known writer Mar\u00eda Lej\u00e1rraga. In August 1934 the Spanish committee sent a delegation to the World Congress of Women against War and Fascism in Paris. Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri led the group, which included two Republicans and two Communists, Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola and Irene Falc\u00f3n. The Spanish committee was dissolved in October 1934 during the repression that followed the Asturian miners' strike. Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola, Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri and others launched the Organization for Workers' Children, from which eventually emerged the Association of Antifascist Women (AMA: Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres Antifascistas). Fuyola was active in creating this association, and became its secretary-general. She was a member of the board of Mujeres (Women), the official publication of the AMA whose first issue was published on 15 February 1936. She also headed the International Red Aid (Socorro Rojo). In 1936, just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) she worked in the main postal administration in Madrid. She was arrested and imprisoned several times during this period for her opposition to the government. ==Civil War== Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola continued her political and propaganda activity after the outbreak of the civil war. She participated in the Madrid Front, and reached the rank of Major. In August 1936 she was appointed spokeswoman for the Child Protection Board in Madrid. In 1937 she published Anti-fascist Women, Work and Organization. She continued to lead the Socorro Rojo, and participated personally and at great risk towards the end of the war in releasing several communists from the concentration camps of Alicante. ==Later years== When the civil war ended Fuyola found work as a maid in Pamplona, then made her way to France. She stayed in Le Mans, then traveled to Paris where the Communist Party of France helped her leave for Mexico on the ship Le Havre. She was prevented from disembarking in Cuba because of her Communist affiliation, and reached Veracruz in November 1939. She spent four years in Zamora, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. In 1942 she moved to Mexico City where she was welcomed by Communist comrades. In 1942 the Francoist authorities proscribed Fuyola, whom they said was more dangerous and important in the Communist Party than the Pasionaria. In October 1942 her first husband, Luis Send\u00edn, was shot in Madrid. In Mexico City Fuyola started a new life with a new partner. Her son was born in Mexico. Her home was open to compatriots such as Pedro Checa (1910\u20131942), Wenceslao Roces (1897\u20131992) and Antonio Izcaray. She worked as a proofreader and translator of French texts. She maintained her old connections and interests, and wrote for Communist publications such as Mundo Obrero and Espa\u00f1a. She was active in the Union of Spanish Women, and between 1948 and 1950 was secretary and president. She died in Mexico City on 8 December 1982. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1907 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from Huesca Category:Spanish communists Category:Spanish educators Category:Spanish women educators ",
