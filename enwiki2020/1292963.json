    "text": "The Sunshine Coast Regional District of British Columbia is located on the southern mainland coast, across Georgia Strait (part of the Salish Sea) from Vancouver Island. It borders on the Powell River Regional District to the north, the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District to the east, and, across Howe Sound, the Metro Vancouver District to the south. The regional district offices are located in the District Municipality of Sechelt. ==Geography== The majority of the Sunshine Coast is sparsely populated. The Coast Mountains make up the inland area. Population is concentrated along the coast. Midway up the coast, beginning at the town of Sechelt, the coastal area forms a peninsula separated from the inland area by Sechelt Inlet. The 2001 census reported a total population of 25,599 persons living on a land area of 3,778.17 km\u00b2 (1,458.76 sq mi). The Sunshine Coast is typically accessed via boat or plane; no roads connect the district with the rest of the province. From Vancouver, ferries run from Horseshoe Bay to Gibsons across Howe Sound. At the northern end of the peninsula, ferries run from Earl's Cove to Saltery Bay. ==Communities== ===District municipality=== *Sechelt ===Town=== *Gibsons ===Indian government district=== *Sechelt (Part) ===Indian reserves=== *Chekwelp 26 *Chekwelp 26A *Schaltuuch 27 ===Unincorporated=== *Roberts Creek *Halfmoon Bay *Madeira Park *Garden Bay *Egmont *Hopkins Landing ===Electoral areas=== *Pender Harbour/Egmont/Madeira Park (Electoral Area A) - Pop 2,678 Census Profile. 2.statcan.gc.ca.
