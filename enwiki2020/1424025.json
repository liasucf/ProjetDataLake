The village is located roughly halfway between Rugby and Coventry, and had a population of 2,564 at the 2011 census. It is close to the A45 road and the Roman road the Fosse Way. The River Avon flows through the village. Near the river are the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, Brandon Castle. A Benedictine priory, Wolston Priory, was sited to the east of the village and its earthwork remains are now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The village has two churches: the parish church of St Margaret's and Wolston Baptist Church. Wolston once had a railway station, Brandon and Wolston railway station on the Rugby- Coventry line, but this was closed in 1960, although one of the platforms can still be seen. Periodic calls are made to re-open the station as the combined population of Wolston and Brandon is almost 3,000. One of the most notable features in the village is the railway viaduct which dates from the 1830s and was part of the original London and Birmingham Railway. The viaduct separates Wolston from the smaller village of Brandon. The two shared a football team \"Brandon & Wolston Football Club\".Brandon, Bretford & Wolston History Group: A History of Brandon & Wolston Football Club, page 1, Brandon, Bretford & Wolston History Group They no longer have a senior men's team but they still run a junior club. The village contains a primary school (Wolston St Margarets Primary C of E School). St Margaret's Primary was originally in School Street, but that building is now used as offices. Wolston also used to have a secondary school called Wolston High School, but it was knocked down and replaced with a community centre. Wolston still has a library, and a small selection of shops and pubs. Near to Wolston is the community-owned Brandon Wood. In geology, the village gives its name to the Wolstonian Stage, a British regional subdivision of the Pleistocene Epoch. ==Notable people== *William Rose (1842\u20131917), cricketer ==References== ==External links== *Railways of Warwickshire website Category:Villages in Warwickshire ",
