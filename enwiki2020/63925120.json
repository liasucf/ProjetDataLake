    "text": "The Arch of Isabel II The Arch of Isabel II (in Spanish el Arco de Isabel II) was an ephemeral triumphal arch, now disappeared, located in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain. This commemorative monument was built in front of the old Puerta Nueva in 1862. The reason for its construction was to welcome the arrival of Queen Isabel II to the city of Cordoba, which took place on September 14, 1862. After the Queen's visit, the arch was abandoned and later dismantled. == Description == The monument was supported by two rectangular bodies between which there was a semicircular arch. The interior facade is unknown because no images of it are preserved. == References == Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1862 Category:Buildings and structures in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Spain Category:Triumphal arches in Spain Category:Monuments and memorials in Andalusia ",
