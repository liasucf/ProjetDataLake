    "text": "Screenster is a cloud-based platform for UI testing automation. It is primarily used for visual regression testing of web applications and websites. The platform is developed and maintained by AgileEngine LLC. ==History== Screenster was developed in 2014. ==Overview== Unlike code-based solutions that use programming languages (e.g. Selenium or PhantomJS), Screenster operates as a scriptless/codeless tool. Instead of simulating user actions with scripts, Screenster offers record-playback test automation functionality, which means the platform records actual user interactions with the GUI. The recorded actions are then automatically re-run during the regression testing phase. ==Functionality== * Visual baselines: when user interactions are being recorded, the tool captures UI screenshots and DOM snapshots after each user action. The screenshots are stored as visual baselines for further comparison. * Screenshot comparison: during the regression testing phase, Screenster takes new screenshots of the UI and compares them to the visual baseline. The differences are automatically highlighted. * Management of layout differences: the platform uses screenshot comparison to detect differences between the visual baseline and new screenshots taken during regression testing. If the differences result from an intended modification of the UI, testers can add them to the baseline. * Ignoring dynamic regions: it is possible to select UI areas that will be ignored during further comparisons. This feature is used for handling UI areas with dynamic content \u2014 e.g. banner ads served from a third party server. * CI integration: the platform is compatible with continuous integration environments like Jenkins via a proprietary plugin. Screenster ships as a commercial solution that runs on a shared server on premise or on the cloud. Other functionality of the platform includes automatic management of timeouts and locators. == See also == * Test automation * GUI software testing * Web testing ** List of web testing tools **Comparison of GUI testing tools * List of GUI testing tools * Regression testing == References == Category:Graphical user interface testing ",
