As a player, he was a defender and notably played for Walsall, Hereford United and Mansfield Town. He became manager of Mansfield in 2002, and later Kidderminster Harriers. In 2006, he became assistant manager of Grimsby Town where he remained until 2009 where he then spent three years as a development coach at Hull City. He was briefly appointed assistant manager at Stockport County in 2013. ==Playing career== Watkiss started his playing career at Ward's Bridge School in his hometown of Wolverhampton. He then joined Willenhall Town, for the youth team, which reached the Midland Floodlit Youth League Cup final at Villa Park during the 1982\u201383 season. He later joined his home town club Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he served his apprenticeship as a 17-year-old. His debut was on 17 March 1984 in a Division One game with Sunderland; however, after making only two appearances, he joined West Midlands (Regional) League side Gresley Rovers in June 1985, before making a move to Crewe Alexandra in January 1986. He went on to play for Rushall Olympic, Walsall, and Hereford United before moving to Mansfield Town in 1996, scoring his only goal for the Stags in a 2\u20134 win at Darlington in October when he met a Ben Sedgemore cross with a header which bounced downward and up into the top corner of the net. Watkiss remained with Town until hanging his boots up in 1999. ==Management and coaching career== ===Mansfield Town=== Watkiss remained at Mansfield Town as youth team coach taking over from Tony Ford, producing at least ten players who progressed into the first team during his three years in charge of the club's youth set-up. In June 2001, assistant manager Mark Kearney left to join Northampton Town as youth team coach. Speculation mounted that Watkiss would step up to assistant manager. Watkiss told the press \"I do feel that the job would be a natural progression for me. A lot of the lads who have come up through the club were with me and I would like the chance to work with them again.\" A few of weeks later, the club's official website revealed that \"the worst kept secret in the club's history had been confirmed\", and Watkiss was promoted to assistant manager. Manager Billy Dearden explained, \"I gave the position a lot of thought and have decided that Stuart is the best man for the job. He is a young coach who could go a long way in the game. He is at the right age to work with me, and it is a huge reward for him. He has done an excellent job with the youth team and it was a huge wrench to take him away from the youth team.\" Watkiss said \"I am confident in my ability, I wouldn\u2019t have gone for the job if not. Obviously time will tell if I am a success or not, but I am cautiously optimistic. It will be great working with Bill Dearden. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience within the game and I will be watching and learning all the time.\" Following the resignation of Billy Dearden to take over at Notts County, Watkiss made the step up from assistant manager at Mansfield Town to become the team's manager in January 2002, where he guided them to their first promotion in 10 years.
