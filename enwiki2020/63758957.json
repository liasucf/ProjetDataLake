Parti Mon\u00e9gasque has a loose structure and looks more like a study circle with the emphasis not on the actual number of members, but on exchanging the ideas. The party has one representative on the National Council, Christine Pasquier-Ciulla, and around 30-50 supporters and sympathizers. == References == Category:Political parties in Monaco Category:Politics of Monaco Category:Political organisations based in Monaco ",
