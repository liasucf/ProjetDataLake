She is best known for her remarkable last leg in the 2014 European Championships 4 \u00d7 400 m relay, when she went from fourth to first in the last 50 metres of the race. == Career == In August 2014 at the European Athletics Championships in Zurich Gue\u00ef ran one of the most remarkable final legs of a 4 x 400m relay ever seen. She took the baton in fourth place approximately a second behind the three leading runners from the UK, Russia and Ukraine, each of whom had run faster than Gue\u00ef in the individual 400m event at the Championships. With 200m remaining she still appeared out of medal contention but finished with a sprint in which she passed all the other athletes in the last 50m to win the race for France at the last stride by 0.05 seconds. Her time for the leg was 49.71, almost two seconds faster than her lifetime best of 51.42, prompting the exclamation from an ecstatic French TV commentator \"mais ce n'est pas possible!\". On 4 Mar 2017, Floria Gue\u00ef won the 400 m gold medal at the 2017 European Indoor Championships On 24 July 2017, Gue\u00ef announced her withdrawal from the 2017 World Championships due to medical issues. In 2018, she finished second at the 2018 Athletics World Cup in the 400 metres and returned later that evening to anchor the 4x400 metres relay with another remarkable run, pulling France from a distant fifth to take the bronze medal. ==Competition record== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=2|2008 |rowspan=2|World Junior Championships |rowspan=2|Bydgoszcz, Poland |27th (h) |400 m |55.74 |- |4th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:35.83 |- |2010 |European Championships |Barcelona, Spain |5th (h) |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:27.44 |- |rowspan=4|2011 |European Indoor Championships |Paris, France |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:32.16 |- |rowspan=2|European U23 Championships |rowspan=2|Ostrava, Czech Republic |12th (h) |400 m |54.09 |- |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:31.73 |- |World Championships |Daegu, South Korea |14th (h) |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:28.02 |- |rowspan=2|2012 |European Championships |Helsinki, Finland |bgcolor=silver|2nd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:25.49 |- |Olympic Games |London, United Kingdom |6th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:25.92 |- |rowspan=4|2013 |rowspan=2|World Championships |rowspan=2|Moscow, Russia |12th (sf) |400 m |51.42 |- |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:24.21 |- |rowspan=2|Jeux de la Francophonie |rowspan=2|Nice, France |bgcolor=gold|1st |400 m |52.31 |- |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:35.20 |- |rowspan=3|2014 |IAAF World Relays |Nassau, Bahamas |4th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:25.84 |- |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland |11th (sf) |400 m |52.82 |- |bgcolor=gold|1st |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:24.28 |- |rowspan=4|2015 |rowspan=2|European Indoor Championships |rowspan=2|Prague, Czech Republic |6th (sf) |400 m |53.00 |- |bgcolor=gold|1st |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:31.61 |- |rowspan=2|World Championships |rowspan=2|Beijing, China |15th (sf) |400 m |51.30 |- |7th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:26.45 |- |rowspan=4|2016 |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Amsterdam, Netherlands |bgcolor=silver|2nd |400 m |51.21 |- |bgcolor=silver|2nd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:25.96 |- |rowspan=2|Olympic Games |rowspan=2|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |11th (sf) |400 m |51.08 |- |10th (h) |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:26.18 |- |rowspan=3|2017 |rowspan=2|European Indoor Championships |rowspan=2|Belgrade, Serbia |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |400 m |51.90 |- |5th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:33.61 |- |IAAF World Relays |Nassau, Bahamas |8th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:35.03 |- |rowspan=2|2018 |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Berlin, Germany |7th |400 m |51.57 |- |bgcolor=silver|2nd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:27.17 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Ivorian descent Category:French female sprinters Category:Sportspeople from Nantes Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of France Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for France Category:Black French sportspeople ",
