    "text": "\"Carol of the Bells\" is a popular Christmas carol, with music by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych in 1914Korchova, Olena (December 17, 2012). \"Carol of the Bells: Back to the Origins\". The Ukrainian Week. Retrieved December 21, 2015. and lyrics by Peter J. Wilhousky. The song is based on the Ukrainian folk chant \"Shchedryk\".Thompson, Matt (December 2015). \"The Ironic Intensity of 'Carol of the Bells'\" The Atlantic. Retrieved December 21, 2015. Wilhousky's lyrics are under copyright protection (owned by Carl Fischer Music); the music is in the public domain. The music is based on a four-note ostinato and is in 3/4 time signature. The ringer of the B-flat bell, though, feels it in 6/8 time. The carol is metrically bistable, and a listener can focus on either meter or switch between them. It has been performed in many genres: classical, metal, jazz, country music, rock, and pop. The piece has also been featured in films, television shows, and parodies. ==Background== ===Origins=== Composer Mykola Leontovych Conductor of the Ukrainian Republic Choir Oleksander Koshyts (also spelled Alexander Koshetz) commissioned Leontovych to create the song based on traditional Ukrainian folk chants, and the resulting new work for choir, \"Shchedryk\", was based on four notes Leontovych found in an anthology. The original folk story related in the song was associated with the coming New Year, which, in pre-Christian Ukraine, was celebrated with the coming of spring in April. The original Ukrainian title translates to \"the generous one\"Collins, Andrew (2010). \"Carol of the Bells\" in Stories Behind the Greatest Hits of Christmas. Zondervan: Grand Rapids, Michigan. p. 39. . or is perhaps derived from the Ukrainian word for bountiful (shchedryj), and tells a tale of a swallow flying into a household to proclaim the bountiful year that the family will have.Peterson, Lottie (December 20, 2015). \"The creation of carols: A look at the history behind 7 beloved holiday songs.\" The Deseret News. Retrieved December 21, 2015. With the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine and the adoption of the Julian calendar, the celebration of the New Year was moved from April to January, and the holiday with which the chant was originally associated became Malanka ( Shchedry vechir), the eve of the Julian New Year (the night of January 13\u201314 in the Gregorian calendar). The songs sung for this celebration are known as Shchedrivky. The song was first performed by students at Kiev University in December 1916, but the song lost popularity in Ukraine shortly after the Soviet Union took hold. It was introduced to Western audiences by the Ukrainian National Chorus during its 1919 concert tour of Europe and the Americas, where it premiered in the United States on October 5, 1921 to a sold-out audience at Carnegie Hall.Almond, B.J. (December 13, 2004). \"'Carol of the Bells' wasn't originally a Christmas song\". Rice University via EurekAlert! Retrieved December 21, 2015. The original work was intended to be sung a cappella by mixed four-voice choir. Two other settings of the composition were also created by Leontovych: one for women's choir (unaccompanied) and another for children's choir with piano accompaniment. These are rarely performed or recorded. ===English lyric versions=== Wilhousky rearranged the melody for orchestra with new lyrics for NBC radio network's symphony orchestra, centered around the theme of bells because the melody reminded him of hand bells, which begins \"Hark! How the bells\". It was first aired during the Great Depression, and Wilhousky copyrighted the new lyrics in 1936 and also published the song, despite the song having been published almost two decades earlier in the Ukrainian National Republic. Its initial popularity stemmed largely from Wilhousky's ability to reach a wide audience as his role as arranger for the NBC Symphony Orchestra. It is now strongly associated with Christmas because of its new lyrics, which reference bells, caroling, and the line \"merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas\". \"Ring, Christmas Bells\", an English-language variant featuring Nativity-based lyrics, was written by Minna Louise Hohman in 1947.Nobbman, Dale V.

Two other versions exist by anonymous writers: one from 1957 titled \"Come Dance and Sing\" and one from 1972 that begins \"Hark to the bells\".Crump, William D. (2013). \"Carol of the Bells\" in The Christmas Encyclopedia. 3rd Edition. McFarland & Company, Inc. Publishers: Jefferson, NC. p. 62. . American recordings by various artists began to surface on the radio in the 1940s. The song gained further popularity when it was featured in television advertisements for champagne in the 1970s by French a cappella group the Swingle Singers.Cuddihy, Kevin and Phillip Metcalfe (2005). \"Sing It and Swing It\" in Christmas's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Kris Kringles, Merry Jingles, and Holiday Cheer.
