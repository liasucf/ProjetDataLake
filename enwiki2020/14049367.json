No one, least of all the strict Sander, suspects his daughter Edith. So far, Pierrot managed to avoid being unmasked, although it sometimes takes considerable wit. And so it is again today, when being cornered, she seeks help from a perfect stranger and pretends to be his wife. During the following conversation she learns that the man is in fact Horst Brenkendorf who her father has selected as her future husband. Horst is enchanted by this cheery female in the Pierrot mask, and confides to her that his future bride has been described to him as rather humdrum and plain. They promise to see each other again. The next day Horst pays a visit to Peter Sander, and Edith, whom Horst fails to recognize, plays the role of the rather dull maiden. Disappointed by his future bride, he is even more captivated by Pierrot when they meet again at a ball that evening. Six months later Horst and Edith marry. On the wedding day, he surprisingly receives a billet-doux from Pierrot, inviting him to the tryst they promised each other at the ball. Horst is reluctant to go, but when he recognizes Pierrot's true identity from the ring she wears, he decides to go. Edith is bitterly disappointed by her husband's apparent willingness to cheat on her on her wedding day and breaks out in tears. Horst then ends the cruel play and reveals that he has seen through her disguise - echoes of Susanna and Figaro in act IV. ==Notable arias== *Goldener Pierrot, eine Nacht mit dir *Viel sch\u00f6ne Frauen gibt's im bunten Liebesgarten *Wer am Rosenmontag an Aschermittwoch denkt (duet) *Sei p\u00fcnktlich, und lass mich nicht warten *Man spielt nicht mit Herzen *Tanzen will jedes M\u00e4del *Die Welt ist sch\u00f6n und muss sich drehn (Grit) *Den ersten Walzer hat erdacht der Mann im Mond ==References== * *Reclams Operettenf\u00fchrer, Anton W\u00fcrz (ed.), Stuttgart 1962 Category:1934 operas Category:German-language operettas Category:Operas by Walter Goetze Category:Operas ",
