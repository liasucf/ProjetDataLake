Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 275 died 7 May 2020Jon Edward Ahlquist obituary, The Huntsville Times, 9\u201310 May 2020.) is an American molecular biologist and ornithologist who has specialized in molecular phylogenetics. He has collaborated extensively with Charles Sibley, primarily at Yale University. By 1987, both Ahlquist and Sibley had left Yale. In 1988, Ahlquist and Sibley were awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal by the National Academy of Sciences. In January 1991 (often listed as 1990), Charles Sibley and Ahlquist published Phylogeny and Classification of Birds, which presented a new phylogeny for birds based on DNA-DNA hybridisation techniques, known as the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. At that time, he was an associate professor of zoology at Ohio University. In 1999, Ahlquist was retired. Ahlquist became a Young Earth Creationist some years before he died. == See also == * Sibley\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy == References == Category:American ornithologists Category:American Christian Young Earth creationists Category:Living people Category:Ohio University faculty Category:Recipients of awards from the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:1944 births ",
