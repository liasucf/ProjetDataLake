    "text": "\"The Greatest\" is a song recorded by Australian singer and songwriter Sia for the deluxe edition of her seventh studio album, This Is Acting (2016). Being made available for digital consumption as the record's third single on 5 September 2016 through Monkey Puzzle and RCA Records, \"The Greatest\" features a new part with the American rapper Kendrick Lamar. The electropop song was written by Sia, Greg Kurstin, and Lamar while production was only handled by Kurstin. The solo version was written only by the former two. The song was originally intended to be in a new album called We Are Your Children.http://gagadaily.com/forums/topic/204269-is-we-are-your-children- cancelled/ An accompanying music video for the single was filmed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and features American dancer Maddie Ziegler surrounded by 48 different young people. Although the singer has not provided an interpretation of the video's plot, numerous media outlets have perceived it as a tribute to the 49 victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Commercially, \"The Greatest\" reached the top five in several countries and was awarded with certifications in different territories. The music video was nominated for a 2017 MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography.\"MTV VMA Best Choreography\", MTV.com, accessed 25 July 2017. ==Composition== Billboard editor Gil Kaufman described \"The Greatest\" as an \"uplifting, poppy song with a subtle island vibe.\" The song is written in the key of C minor with a cut common time tempo of 96 beats per minute. The vocals span from B\u266d3 to E\u266d5 in the song. ==Critical reception== Jessica Goodman from Entertainment Weekly explained the chorus \"massive and catchy.\" Once the critics had picked up on the song's connection with the Orlando nightclub shooting, Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote: > Making pop about a specific tragedy is necessarily a tricky job.

In its second week on UK Singles Chart, the song climbed to number 5, making it Sia's ninth top ten single on that chart, and Kendrick's second. It later rose to number 2 in Australia, number 1 in Switzerland, and number 18 in the US. In its fourth week on the singles chart, \"The Greatest\" was certified Gold in both Australia and Canada. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Sia and Daniel Askill and choreographed by Ryan Heffington. The director of photography was Mathieu Plainfosse. It was released on 5 September 2016 and has been viewed on YouTube more than 650 million times.Furler, Sia. \"Sia \u2013 'The Greatest'\", Youtube: SiaVEVO, 5 September 2016, accessed 29 December 2016 Writers from several media outlets, including E! Online, Cosmopolitan, Variety, People magazine, concluded that the video was a tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. The video opens with a low drone and cuts between shots of a upset Maddie Ziegler painting rainbow colours on her cheeks. She frees 48 other young people trapped in a cage (49 being the number of people killed in the shooting); their freedom is short-lived, however. Later, a wall is seen filled with bullet holes as everyone falls to the ground, and tears stream down Ziegler's face.Sources about the music video: *Vulpo, Mike. \"Sia's Music Video Tribute to Orlando With Maddie Ziegler and Kendrick Lamar Will Take Your Breath Away\", Eonline.com, 6 September 2016 *Murphy, Desiree \"Maddie Ziegler Rocks a Black Wig, Rainbow Face Paint in Sia's Haunting Tribute Video to Orlando Victims\", ETonline.com, 6 September 2016 *Adams, Char. \"Sia Releases Haunting 'The Greatest' Music Video: Is It an Orlando Shooting Tribute?\", People magazine, 6 September 2016 *Van Der Meer, Erin. \"Sia's The Greatest video is a tribute to the Orlando nightclub shooting victims\", Cosmopolitan, 6 September 2016 *Yee, Lawrence. \"Sia Evokes Orlando Nightclub Shooting in New Music Video\", Variety, 6 September 2016 *Rose, Elena. \"Sia honors victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting with new music video\", The Daily Collegian, 13 September 2016 Kornhaber wrote: > Absent of any social context, it's all striking and beautiful and ineffably > sad.
