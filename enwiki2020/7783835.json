    "text": "New York City (You're a Woman) is the fourth album by American singer- songwriter Al Kooper for Columbia Records, recorded and released in 1971. ==Background== The album was recorded with two separate groups, one in Los Angeles, California (which produced eight tracks) and the other in London, England (which produced three). It was inspired by the likes of Elton John (whose \"Come Down in Time\" is covered), The Beatles and Neil Young. Kooper trotted out a more subdued sound than on his previous albums, recorded without the horns and orchestrations. He kept to his normal format of original compositions interspersed with covers, including the traditional folk-song \"500 Miles\". Among the best-known tracks from the album is the title track, the only released portion of the presumably unfinished New York City: 6 A.M. to Midnight project. ==Track listing== # \"New York City (You're a Woman)\" (Al Kooper) \u2013 5:20 # \"John the Baptist (Holy John)\" (Kooper, Phyllis Major) \u2013 3:34 # \"Can You Hear It Now (500 Miles)\" (Traditional, arranged by Kooper) \u2013 3:27 # \"The Ballad of the Hard Rock Kid\" (Kooper) \u2013 4:19 # \"Going Quietly Mad\" (Kooper) \u2013 3:54 # Medley #:\"Oo Wee Baby, I Love You\" (Richard Parker) \u2013 1:59 #:\"Love Is A Man's Best Friend\" (Irwin Levine, Kooper) \u2013 2:24 # \"Back on My Feet\" (Kooper) \u2013 3:22 # \"Come Down in Time\" (Bernie Taupin, Elton John) \u2013 4:39 # \"Dearest Darling\" (Bo Diddley) \u2013 3:55 # \"Nightmare #5\" (Kooper) \u2013 3:00 # \"The Warning (Someone's on the Cross Again)\" (Kooper, Phyllis Major) \u2013 3:00 ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * Al Kooper \u2013 piano, organ, guitars, mellotron, harmonium, vocals * Paul Humphries \u2013 drums (tracks 2-4, 6-9, 11) * Bobbye Hall Porter \u2013 percussion (tracks 2-4, 6-9, 11) * Lou Shelton \u2013 guitar (tracks 2-4, 6-8, 11) * Terry Kath \u2013 guitar solo (track 3) * Carol Kaye \u2013 electric bass (tracks 2, 4, 7, 9, 11) * Herbie Flowers \u2013 electric bass (tracks 1, 5, 8, 10) * Bobby West \u2013 acoustic and electric basses (tracks 3, 6, 8) * Roger Pope \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 5, 10) * Sneaky Pete Kleinow \u2013 pedal steel (tracks 4, 11) * Caleb Quaye \u2013 guitar (tracks 5, 10) * Various combinations of Rita Coolidge, Venetta Fields, Clydie King, Donna Weiss, Julia Tillman Waters, Edna Wright, Maxine Willard Waters, Lorna Willard, Edna Woods, Claudia Lennear, Dorothy Morrison, Robbie Montgomery, Jessie Smith, Robert John, Michael Gately and Jay Siegel \u2013 backing vocals (tracks 2-3, 6-9, 11) ===Technical=== * Al Kooper \u2013 producer * Doug Pomeroy, Frank Laico, Ken Scott, Mark Friedman, Sy Mitchell \u2013 engineers * Richard Avedon \u2013 cover photography * John Berg \u2013 design ==References== Category:1971 albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Al Kooper albums Category:Albums produced by Al Kooper Category:Albums recorded at Trident Studios ",
