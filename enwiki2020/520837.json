    "text": "Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano (; born 15 September 1972) is Queen of Spain via her marriage to King Felipe VI. She came from a middle-class family and worked as a journalist for ABC and EFE before becoming a news anchor at CNN+ and Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. In 2004, she married Felipe, then Prince of Asturias and heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Their daughters, Leonor and Sof\u00eda, were born in 2005 and 2007 respectively. As Princess of Asturias, Letizia represented her father-in-law, King Juan Carlos, in Spain and abroad. On her father-in-law's abdication in 2014, Felipe and Letizia became king and queen. ==Family== Letizia is the eldest daughter of Jes\u00fas Jos\u00e9 Ortiz \u00c1lvarez, a journalist, and his first wife, Mar\u00eda de la Paloma Rocasolano Rodr\u00edguez, a registered nurse and hospital union representative. She has two younger sisters, Telma (b. 1973) and \u00c9rika (1975\u20132007), whose death was widely reported by press as due to an intentional prescription drug overdose. She was baptised in the Catholic Church on 29 September 1972, in Oviedo. Her parents divorced in 1999 and her father remarried in Madrid on 18 March 2004 to fellow journalist Ana Togores. Letizia's paternal grandparents were Jos\u00e9 Luis Ortiz Velasco (ca. 1923\u20132005), a commercial employee at Olivetti; and Mar\u00eda del Carmen \"Menchu\" \u00c1lvarez del Valle (born 1928), a radio broadcaster in Asturias for over 40 years. Her maternal grandfather was Francisco Julio Rocasolano Camacho (1918\u20132015), a mechanic and cab driver in Madrid for over 20 years who was of French and Occitan origin. Letizia's maternal grandmother, Enriqueta Rodriguez Figueredo (1919\u20132008) was born in the Philippines to Spanish parents. British genealogists have provided evidence that through her mother's Rocasolano lineage, Letizia descends from Astorg Roquesoulane (died c.1564) and her coat-of-arms incorporates the arms of the Rocasolano family. Armas de Do\u00f1a Letizia, Revista Internacional de Protocolo, , Number 33, 2004, pp. 64\u201365Label\u2019s position correction by RIAG, Registro Internacional de Armas Gentilicias . (Retrieved 17 June 2009) Reports have suggested \u2013 and remain unproven \u2013 that on her paternal grandfather's side, Letizia is a descendant of an untitled family descended from medieval nobility who served as constables of Castile. ==Education and career== Letizia attended La Gesta School in Oviedo, before her family moved to Rivas-Vaciamadrid near Madrid, where she attended the Ramiro de Maeztu High School.\u2013 El traslado de su familia a Madrid marc\u00f3 la direcci\u00f3n de su vida She completed a bachelor's degree in journalism, at the Complutense University of Madrid, as well as a master's degree in audiovisual journalism at the Institute for Studies in Audiovisual Journalism.The Royal Household of His Majesty the King \u2013 Her Royal Highness the Princess of Asturias During her studies, Letizia worked for the Asturian daily newspaper La Nueva Espa\u00f1a and later for the newspaper ABC and the news agency EFE. After completing her master's degree, she travelled to Guadalajara, Mexico, working at the newspaper Siglo 21 and was working on her PhD; however, she did not complete her doctoral thesis because she returned to Spain. After returning to Spain, she worked for the Spanish version of the economic channel Bloomberg before moving to the news network CNN+. In 2000, she moved to TVE, where she started working for the news channel 24 Horas. In 2002, she anchored the weekly news report programme Informe Semanal and later the daily morning news programme Telediario Matinal on TVE 1. In August 2003, a few months before her engagement to Felipe, Letizia was promoted to anchor of the TVE daily evening news programme Telediario 2, the most viewed newscast in Spain. In 2000, Letizia reported from Washington, D.C., on the presidential elections. In September 2001, she broadcast live from Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks in New York and in 2003, she filed reports from Iraq following the war. In 2002 she sent several reports from Galicia in northern Spain following the ecological disaster when the oil tanker Prestige sank. ==First marriage== Letizia married Alonso Guerrero P\u00e9rez (born in 1962), a writer and a high-school literature teacher, on 7 August 1998, in a simple civil ceremony at Almendralejo, in Badajoz, after a 10-year courtship. The marriage was dissolved by divorce in 1999. ==Second marriage and children== wedding of the Crown Princess of Sweden in 2010 On 1 November 2003, to the surprise of many, the Royal Household announced Letizia's engagement to Felipe, then Prince of Asturias. Afterwards, she moved to live in a wing of the Zarzuela Palace until the day of her wedding. The Prince of Asturias had proposed to her with a 16-baguette diamond engagement ring with a white gold trim. She marked the occasion by giving him white gold and sapphire cufflinks and a classic book. The wedding took place on 22 May 2004 in the Cathedral Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de la Almudena in Madrid. It was the first royal wedding in this cathedral. It had been nearly a century since the capital celebrated a royal wedding, as the prince's parents married in Athens, and his sisters, Infanta Elena and Infanta Cristina, married in Seville and Barcelona respectively. Letizia's bridal gown was designed by Spanish fashion designer Manuel Pertegaz, her bridal shoes by Pura L\u00f3pez; and the veil, a gift from Felipe to his bride, was made of off-white silk tulle and hand-embroidered with detailing. As Letizia's previous marriage involved only a civil ceremony, the Catholic Church does not consider it canonically valid and therefore did not require an annulment to proceed with a Catholic marriage to the Prince of Asturias. Letizia and Felipe have two daughters: Leonor, Princess of Asturias, born on 31 October 2005; and Infanta Sof\u00eda, born on 29 April 2007. They were born at Ruber International Hospital in Madrid. ==Princess of Asturias== The Prince and Princess of Asturias visit the Paranal Observatory. Princess Letizia immediately joined in the duties of her husband and traveled extensively through Spain representing her father-in-law. They also represented Spain in other countries: she has traveled along with her husband to Jordan, Mexico, Peru, Hungary, the Dominican Republic, Panama, the United States of America, Serbia, Brazil, Uruguay, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, China, and Portugal. She also greeted international dignitaries, along with other members of the royal family, and attended gatherings of foreign royalty in Luxembourg, for the silver wedding anniversary of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and in the Netherlands for the 40th birthday of the Prince of Orange. Her solo agenda was announced in 2006, shortly after the announcement of her second pregnancy. Letizia has performed a couple of audiences and her work focuses on social issues such as children rights, culture, and education. In late 2007, her solo agenda started to grow in the quantity of events she performed by herself and Felipe's and Letizia's agendas became more distinct and separate. Letizia supported Spanish designers, from couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile to Zara and Mango, and continues to as queen consort. == Queen of Spain == Queen Letizia alongside Juliana Awada, First Lady of Argentina, in 2017. On 19 June 2014, Letizia became Queen of Spain; as such, she holds the style of Majesty. She is the first Spanish-born queen consort since Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans, the first wife of Alfonso XII, in 1878. She is also the first Spanish queen to have been born as a commoner. Queen Letizia undertook her first solo engagement as queen on 23 June 2014 at the inauguration of the El Greco and modern painting exhibition at the National Prado museum in Madrid. In their first overseas trip as king and queen, Felipe VI and Letizia met Pope Francis on 30 June 2014, in the Apostolic Palace. They later met with Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, accompanied by Mgsr. Antoine Camilleri, under-secretary for Relations with States. The visit followed one by King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia on 28 April. In 2015, Letizia was named Special Ambassador for Nutrition for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Letizia and Felipe and the princesses still reside at the same residence where they have lived since 2004. It is stated that the Palace of Zarzuela is a working place only for Felipe. In March 2016, leaked text messages between Letizia and businessman Javier Lopez Madrid created a controversy. Together with other executives and board members of the Caja Madrid and Bankia financial group, Madrid had been accused of corruption. In October 2014 Letizia pledged her support for him, texting \"We know who you are and you know who we are. We know each other, like each other, respect each other. To hell with the rest. Kisses yoga mate (miss you!!!)\". Felipe also joined in, texting \"We do indeed!\" Publication of the texts by the newspaper El Diario threatened to undo the line Felipe had drawn between himself and the scandal of Infanta Cristina and her husband, as well as questions over the origins of ex-King Juan Carlos's private fortune. A palace official subsequently stated that the King and Queen were no longer friends with Madrid due to his legal issues. ==Titles and honours== At the time of her marriage to Prince Felipe, Letizia was appointed to the Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III as dame on 21 May 2004.BOE Number 124, pp. 19314-19314 22 May 2004. (Retrieved 13 September 2015) Since then, Letizia has received different appointments and decorations by foreign states and other Spanish honours. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of the Spanish Monarchy * The Ancestry of Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano (b. 1972) |- Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Oviedo Category:House of Bourbon (Spain) Category:Spanish monarchy Category:Spanish royal consorts Category:Spanish television presenters Category:Spanish journalists Category:Princesses of Asturias Category:Princesses of Viana Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Felipe VI of Spain ",
