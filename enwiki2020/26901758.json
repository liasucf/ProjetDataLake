The school has its roots in an 1869 initiative which provided organized musical education in the city of Valencia for the first time; with teachers providing instruction in their own homes rather than at a particular facility. These teachers eventually formed the school's first faculty when the conservatory opened its doors in 1879 as the \"Conservatorio Municipal de Valencia\". The school changed to its present name in 1979 in honor of the conductor and pianist Jos\u00e9 Iturbi. ==External links== *Conservatorio Municipal \u201cJos\u00e9 Iturbi\u201d de Valencia at valencia.es Category:Music schools in Spain Category:Schools in Valencia Category:Culture in Valencia Category:Educational institutions established in 1879 Category:1879 establishments in Spain ",
