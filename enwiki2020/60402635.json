    "text": "Dr Madge Judith Dresser FRHS was an Associate Professor in History at the University of the West of England, and is currently Honorary Professor in the department of Historical Studies at the University of Bristol. Her specialities are the history of slavery, national identity, women's history, and the position of religious and ethnic minorities in British society. She is active in Journey to Justice, a Bristolian charity highlighting the history of social justice and marginalised voices. She has frequently made efforts to acknowledge the role of Edward Colston in Bristol's slave trade industry, noting the \"reluctance in some quarters\" to mention it in relation to the statue of him. As such, she has been involved with the rewording process of the statue's plaque. == Published works == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\" ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Time of first publication ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | First edition publisher/publication ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Unique identifier ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- ! scope=\"row\" | Slavery Obscured: The Social History of the Slave Trade in an English Provincial Port | 2001 | Continuum | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Diary of Sarah Fox nee Champion, 1745\u20131802 | 2003 | Bristol Record Society | | Editor; written by Sarah Fox, extracted in 1872 by John Frank |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bristol: Ethnic Minorities and the City 1000-2001 | 2008 | Phillimore Publishers | | with Peter Fleming |- ! scope=\"row\" | Women and the City: Bristol 1373-2000 | 2016 | Redcliffe Press | | Editor |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century English historians Category:21st-century British women writers Category:British women historians Category:Academics of the University of the West of England, Bristol Category:Academics of the University of Bristol Category:Historians of slavery Category:Fellows of the Royal Historical Society ",
