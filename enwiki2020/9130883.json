It was founded by a monk called Ignatius (Greek: \u0399\u03b3\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) in the 12th century. It lies 1.5 kilometres from the today village of Panayia, birthplace of the late Archbishop Makarios. The present building dates to 1770. Celebrations are held yearly on 15 August in honour of the Virgin Mary. In the mid 1980s the old winery of the monastery was reopened and now runs on a commercial basis. It produces wines from the monastery's own vineyards. ==External links== *Paphos Bishopric, with links to the monastery Category:Cypriot Orthodox monasteries Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries ",
