The founder of the Sturt Football Club, Arthur Thomas, met Renfrey at the carnival and convinced him to sign with them for the 1909 season. ===Sturt (1909 \u2013 1913)=== Having captained Sturt in his first season, Renfrey was made captain-coach in 1910 and remained in that position for the rest of his time at the club. Renfrey represented South Australia in a total of 11 interstate matches and captained the 1911 Adelaide Carnival team. The South Australians finished the carnival unbeaten, defeating the VFL representative side by 43 points. In the 1913 finals series, Sturt were upset by West Adelaide and following the game several players accused Renfrey of \"playing dead\". With five members of the team refusing to play with him again, Renfrey was sacked by the committee. He was reinstated the next evening after a vote of confidence was carried and took part in their next game, a loss to his former club North Adelaide. Following the match he was involved in a fight with prominent Sturt player Albert Heinrichs and never played for the club again.The Advertiser, \"Renfrey Resigns\", 30 June 1913. p. 15 Despite the bitter end to his time with Sturt, he was later named on the interchange bench in their official \"Team of the Century\". == Coaching == He joined South Adelaide as non playing coach in 1914 and the following year guided them to third position on the ladder.
