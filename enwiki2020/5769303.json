    "text": "UFC 47: It\u2019s On was a mixed martial arts event held by the Ultimate Fighting Championship on April 2, 2004, at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. The event was broadcast live on pay-per-view, and later released on DVD. ==History== Headlining the card was the long-awaited match between Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz. The title \"It's On!\" refers to Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz's long-running negotiations leading up to the fight. Fans had been awaiting the fight for more than a year, and while both fighters had their own stories as to why it took so long, the fight finally took place in 2004. Ortiz claims that as friends and former training partners, he and Liddell had made a pact never to fight. Liddell claims there was no such pact, that he would fight anyone anytime, and accused Ortiz of ducking the fight. A match-up between Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski for the then-vacant UFC Heavyweight Championship was scheduled for the event, but Sylvia was pulled due to a recurrence of positive drug samples just a day before the event. Arlovski was re-booked on short notice in a non-title fight against Wesley Correira, who was pulled from a scheduled main card fight with Mike Kyle to replace Sylvia. Wes Sims stepped in on a day's notice to face Mike Kyle at this event as well. The Sylvia\u2013Arlovski match-up was finally re-booked for the Interim Heavyweight Championship at UFC 51 in February 2005. This was the first card to feature \"On The Mat\" with Marc Laimon, a brief instructional video demonstrating the triangle choke. ==Results== ==Fighter Payroll== The total fighter payroll for UFC 47 was $333,000. *Tito Ortiz: $125,000 ($125,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $50,000) *Chuck Liddell: $100,000 ($50,000 for fighting; $50,000 win bonus) *Andrei Arlovski: $23,000 ($15,000 for fighting; $8,000 win bonus) *Genki Sudo: $16,000 ($8,000 for fighting; $8,000 win bonus) *Wes \"Cabbage\" Correira: $12,000 ($12,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $12,000) *Yves Edwards: $12,000 ($6,000 for fighting; $6,000 win bonus) *Robbie Lawler: $8,000 ($8,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $8,000) *Hermes Franca: $6,000 ($6,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $6,000) *Nick Diaz: $6,000 ($3,000 for fighting; $3,000 win bonus) *Mike Kyle: $6,000 ($3,000 for fighting; $3,000 win bonus) *Wes Sims: $5,000 ($5,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $5,000) *Chris Lytle: $4,000 ($2,000 for fighting; $2,000 win bonus) *Jonathan Wiezorek: $4,000 ($2,000 for fighting; $2,000 win bonus) *Mike Brown: $2,000 ($2,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $2,000) *Tiki Ghosn: $2,000 ($2,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $2,000) *Wade Shipp: $2,000 ($2,000 for fighting; win bonus would have been $2,000) == See also == * Ultimate Fighting Championship * List of UFC champions * List of UFC events * 2004 in UFC ==References== ==External links== *Official UFC past events page Category:Ultimate Fighting Championship events Category:2004 in mixed martial arts Category:Mixed martial arts in Las Vegas Category:2004 in sports in Nevada Category:Mandalay Bay Events Center ",
