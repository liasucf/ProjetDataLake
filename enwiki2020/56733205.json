    "text": "S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m is a river in central Stockholm that connects Lake M\u00e4laren with the Baltic Sea. It runs south of Gamla stan from Riddarfj\u00e4rden to Stockholms str\u00f6m (the western part of Saltsj\u00f6n). It is one of two natural waterways between M\u00e4laren and the Baltic sea, the other being Norrstr\u00f6m north of Gamla stan. The river is locked by Karl Johansslussen (Karl Johan's lock), and most of the time is conceived as more like a bay of M\u00e4laren. The area around the lock is known as the Slussenomr\u00e5det, and beginning in 2016 is undergoing a major revitalization. The channel of an older lock, known as the Nils Ericson lock, still exists just to the north of Karl Johansslussen. This lock is hidden by the steps leading to Karl Johans Torg, but it still allows for the discharge of water from M\u00e4laren into the Baltic. It is planned to convert the channel of this older lock into a fish ladder, as the revitalized area will include two much larger discharge channels on either side of the new lock. ==References== Category:Geography of Stockholm Category:M\u00e4laren Category:Rivers of Stockholm County Category:Waterways in Sweden ",
