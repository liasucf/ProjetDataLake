    "text": "The site of the alleged Ratman hauntings in Southend-on-Sea, England. The Ratman of Southend is an English urban legend originating in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The story of the Ratman tells of an old homeless man, seeking shelter from the cold in an underpass, was set upon by a group of youths and beaten to near-death, cold and blood loss doing the rest. As he died, the numerous vermin who inhabit the area gathered, and were found to have devoured his face. After this, a ghostly figure was spotted in the underpass, with people hearing ratlike squealing, and scraping, as if large claws were moving across the walls. ==References== ==External links== *from Mysterious Britain *Article discussing the Ratman story among other folkloric English characters *A list of Southend's most haunted locations *BBC America article Category:Urban legends Category:English ghosts Category:Southend-on-Sea (town) ",
