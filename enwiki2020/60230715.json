    "text": "Metrotr\u00e9n Asturias is a project that consists of the creation of a suburban rail transport network through the homogenization of the lines currently existing in the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias. It consists of a unification of the lines of both operators (Renfe Operadora and Renfe FEVE), the reduction of travel times and transfers, the burying of railway lines and the creation of new stations.Todotrenes: \u00abMetrotr\u00e9n, la revoluci\u00f3n en las cercan\u00edas\u00bb ==History== The project for the renovation of the suburban railway network of Asturias was presented in August 2000 by the Ministry of Development. It consisted mainly in the creation of a new tunnel of 3,858 meters in length in Gij\u00f3n between the Humedal station and the roundabout of Viesques, which included three new stations: Bego\u00f1a, El Bibio and Viesques.La Nueva Espa\u00f1a, [\u00abhttp://www.lne.es/gijon/2011/01/14/destiempos- metrotren/1019380.html Los destiempos del Metrotr\u00e9n]\u00bb The construction of this tunnel began on June 10, 2003 and ended in December 2006, although only the El Bibio station and a technical station were built on Avenida Justo del Castillo.La Voz de Asturias: \u00abEl t\u00fanel de metrotr\u00e9n ve la luz\u00bb The project, by increasing the density of rail transport in Gij\u00f3n and being buried, was known as the \"Gij\u00f3n metro\".La Voz de Asturias, \u00abEl Metro de Gij\u00f3n\u00bb During the construction of the tunnel, the Ministry of Development changed its criteria regarding the rest of the project's actions, deciding that it be extended to reach the Cabue\u00f1es area, thus doubling the length of the section. In addition, the construction of two new stations, an interchange, and the replacement of the planned Bego\u00f1a station by another in the Plaza de Europa were included. This second phase remained paralyzed from the end of the previous phase, with the tunnel remaining unused for the whole time. The complete definition of the second phase ended in 2009, with the remaining cost estimated at \u20ac360 million, with an action along 7 km between the Humedal and Cabue\u00f1es.RTPA: \u00abFomento anuncia una inversi\u00f3n de 360 millones para el metrotr\u00e9n \u00bb The development of this second part began in 2011 through public-private financing, and involves the provisional diversion of the FEVE lines from the Humedal station to the provisional station of Sanz Crespo, which was started in February 2011.La Voz de Asturias: \u00abEl metrotr\u00e9n tendr\u00e1 doble ancho\u00bb This section will have dual- gauge tracks to be used by both Ibergian-gauge Renfe Operadora and metre-gauge Renfe FEVE trains. The project also consists of improvements at other railway stations in Asturias, such as those located in Avil\u00e9s. ==Current situation== In 2017, it was announced that work on the Metrotr\u00e9n tunnel is due to resume in 2019 and conclude in 2023. ==References== Category:Transport in Asturias ",
