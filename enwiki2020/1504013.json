It used Dongdan as its Chinese name, which means the east Dan Gur, in respect to the West Liao dynasty.\u5f90\u4fca. \u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u738b\u671d\u548c\u653f\u6743\u540d\u53f7\u63a2\u6e90. \u6e56\u5317\u6b66\u660c: \u534e\u4e2d\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u793e. 2000\u5e7411\u6708: 262. . However, political tension soon evolved between Yel\u00fc Bei and his younger brother Yel\u00fc Deguang, who took the imperial throne of Khitan after their father Yel\u00fc Abaoji died, en route to his homeland from a relatively successful campaign against the Later Tang. The new emperor ordered his elder brother to move his capital from Huhan in Eastern Manchuria to Liaoyang in Western Manchuria. Bei obeyed the imperial order but soon fled to North China to avoid possible assassination in 930. Bei's son was elevated to the new king of Dongdan, but the kingdom was annexed by the Liao Dynasty in 936.\u5f90\u4fca. \u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u738b\u671d\u548c\u653f\u6743\u540d\u53f7\u63a2\u6e90. \u6e56\u5317\u6b66\u660c: \u534e\u4e2d\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u793e. 2000\u5e7411\u6708: 262. . A minority of historians suggest Dongdan was annexed in 982. On the other hand some beliefe that Dongdan was never a \"independent kingdom\", but was instantly annexed in 926 by the Khitan. To continue Balhae's friendly relations with Japan, Dongdan sent a diplomatic mission over the Sea of Japan in 929. But the Japanese court in Kyoto rejected the mission from Dongdan, due to loyalty for the old Balhae regime.The Kitai Dynasty\u2019s governance of Bohai and the structure of Dongdanguo as seen from Yelu-Yuzu\u2019s Epitaph The King of Dongdan Goes Forth (\u6771\u4e39\u738b\u51fa\u884c\u5716), scroll, light colors on silk. 146.8 x 77.3 cm.
