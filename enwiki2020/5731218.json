    "text": "Fl\u00e1vio Rodrigues da Costa (14 September 1906 - 22 November 1999) was a Brazilian football player and manager. He managed the Rio de Janeiro clubs Flamengo and Vasco, as well as Colo Colo of Chile, and FC Porto of Portugal. Costa coached the Brazilian squad at the 1950 FIFA World Cup. As a consequence of his World Cup failure, he lost his prestige among the Brazilian press and supporters of the national team. However, he was again manager of the Brazilian team in 1955 and in 1956. He died in Rio de Janeiro in November 1999. ==Playing career== From 1926 until 1936, Costa played 145 matches, mostly as a midfielder, in the black and red jerseys of Flamengo and scored 15 goals in the process. From September 1934 forward he was player-manager. The climax of his playing career was the winning of the state championship of Rio de Janeiro in 1927. ==Statistical overview== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=4 | Coaching Career |- ! From ! To !
