    "text": "Nero's Day at Disneyland was an experimental breakcore musical project created by Lauren Bousfield in Oakland, California. Her first album, Attention Shoppers, was released in 2005, followed by From Rotting Fantasylands in 2009. Though the project was cancelled in 2011, Bousfield continued to make music independently. ==History== ===Formation (2005)=== Nero's Day at Disneyland was founded 2005 in Oakland, California by Lauren Bousfield. She made two albums, one mashup album, and two EPs. ===Rise to popularity and break-up (2005\u20132011)=== In addition to albums and EPs, she released several singles (see Discography). In 2007, she contributed to the 3rd Volume of \"The Fruit Will Rot\". The band's last album was the 15-track \"From Rotting Fantasylands\", having at least 30 additional songs left over after the album's release. Nero's Day at Disneyland then separated for unknown reasons and Lauren came out as transgender, changing her name. ===Solo career (2012-present)=== Lauren Bousfield started producing music under her own name in 2012 with her first EP Locked Into Phantasy and later on Avalon Vales in 2013. She released six singles on January 2016 and later a soundtrack for the physics-based puzzle game called Nebulous on Steam. She has also been a part of Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions, working as a score technical assistant on Kung Fu Panda 3 and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. On September 27, 2016, two months before the Ghost Ship fire, Lauren's apartment caught on fire in Los Angeles and she was later hospitalized, losing all of her belongings. She was given skin grafts on her hands, due to 3rd degree burns, for 2 months. She ran on Medi-cal during the hospitalization, which later on fans started donating to Lauren for her medical funds on PayPal and GoFundMe. She later recovered in December and made the Fire Songs EP, mourning the loss of the Ghost Ship fire. On December 9, 2016, fans have made a 30 track album of the Heaven's Gate single, found on her previous SoundCloud as Nero's Day at Disneyland, as well as other unreleased songs (in terms of albums released by her specifically). == Discography == Before Nero's Day at Disneyland * Rock and Roll Mind Control - Beautiful Mutants * Beautiful Mutants - Beautiful Mutants * Who Feeds On Whom - Beautiful Mutants === As Nero's Day at Disneyland === ====Studio albums==== * Attention Shoppers (2005) * Trickle Down Economixxx (2008) * From Rotting Fantasylands (2009) * Heaven's Gate (Unofficial/Fan Project) (2016) ====EPs==== * Grievances And Dead Malls EP (2005) * Colonists (2007) ====Singles==== * Mascara Running Everywhere (2010) * Bent Chorals feat.
