    "text": "Global top-selling light-duty plug-in electric vehicle regional or country markets . Comparison of plug-in electric car ownership per capita in selected top selling countries and regional markets as plug-in cars per 1,000 people, . Electric car use by country varies worldwide, as the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles is affected by consumer demand, market prices, availability of charging infrastructure, and government policies, such as purchase incentives and long term regulatory signals (ZEV mandates, emissions regulations, fuel economy standards, and phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles). Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are generally divided into all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), that run only on batteries, and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), that combine battery power with internal combustion engines. The popularity of electric vehicles has been expanding rapidly due to government subsidies, their increased range and lower battery costs, and environmental sensitivity. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 200 motor vehicles (0.48%) on the world's roads by the end of 2019, of which pure electrics comprised 0.32%. Global cumulative sales of highway-legal light-duty plug-in vehicles reached 2 million units at the end of 2016, 3 million in November 2017, and the 5 million milestone in December 2018. By the end of 2019 the stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles totaled about 7.5 million units. Sales of plug-in passenger cars achieved a 2.5% market share of new car sales in 2019, up from 2.1% in 2018, and 1.3% in 2017. \"Global sales totaled 2,018,247 plug-in passenger cars in 2018, with a BEV:PHEV ratio of 69:31, and a market share of 2.1%. The world's top selling plug-in car was the Tesla Model 3, and Tesla was the top selling manufacturer of plug-in passenger cars in 2018\". The PEV market is shifting towards fully electric battery vehicles. The global ratio between BEVs and PHEVs went from 56:44 in 2012, to 60:40 in 2015, and rose to 74:26 in 2019. See Exhibit 1: Global electric-vehicle sales, 2010-17. , China had the largest stock of highway legal plug-in passenger cars with 3.4 million units, 47% of the global fleet in use. China also dominates the plug-in light commercial vehicle and electric bus deployment, with its stock reaching over 500,000 buses in 2019, 98% of the global stock, and 247,500 electric light commercial vehicles, 65% of the global fleet. , the United States had 1.45 million plug-in cars, 20% of the global stock, with California as the largest U.S. plug-in regional market with almost 670,000 plug-in cars sold up until December 2019. Europe had 1.7 million plug-in passenger cars at the end of 2019, accounting for 25% of the global stock. Europe also has the second largest electric light commercial vehicle stock, with over 115,000 units, 31% of the global stock in 2019. Norway is the leading European country with over 384,000 light-duty plug-ins registered by the end of 2019. Place the pointing device over the graph to show the cumulative number of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in Norway at the end of each year. , the registered light-duty plug-in electric stock totaled 384,066 units, consisting of 268,024 battery electric vehicles and 116,042 plug-in hybrids. Norway has the highest market penetration per capita in the world, and also has the world's largest plug-in segment market share of new car sales, 55.9% in 2019. Over 10% of all passenger cars on Norwegian roads were plug-ins in October 2018, and rose to 13% in 2019. The Netherlands has the highest density of EV charging stations in the world by 2019. == History == Evolution of the ratio between global sales of BEVs and PHEVs from 2011 to 2019. \"Global sales totaled 2,209,831 plug-in passenger cars in 2019, with a BEV to PHEV ratio of 74:26, and a global market share of 2.5%. The world's top selling plug-in car was the Tesla Model 3 with 300,075 units delivered, and Tesla was the top selling manufacturer of plug-in passenger cars in 2019 with 367,820 units, followed by BYD with 229,506.\" The global stock of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) between 2005 and 2009 consisted exclusively of all-electric cars (BEV), totaling about 1,700 units in 2005, and almost 6,000 in 2009. The plug-in stock rose to about 12,500 units in 2010, of which 350 were plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). See pp. 4-5, and 24-25 and Statistical annex, pp. 34-37. By comparison, during the Golden Age of the electric car at the beginning of the 20th century, the EV stock peaked at approximately 30,000 vehicles. After the introduction of the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt in late December 2010, the first mass-production plug-in electric cars by major manufacturers, plug- in sales grew to about 50,000 units in 2011, to 125,000 in 2012, and almost 213,000 cars and utility vans in 2013. Sales totaled over 315,000 units in 2014, up 48% from 2013. In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads was a plug-in, and, by October 2018, 1 in every 10 passenger cars registered in Norway was a plug-in. In five years, global sales of highway legal light-duty plug-in vehicles increased more than ten-fold, totaling more than 565,000 units in 2015\u2014an 80% increase from 2014, driven mainly by China and Europe.

The plan has four goals: create a world-leading industry; energy security; reduce urban air pollution; and to reduce carbon emissions. Download EVS in China (full report). See Table 2: Chinas's EV Sales by Brand, 2011-2013, pp.19. In June 2012 the State Council published a plan to develop the domestic industry. The plan set a sales target of 500,000 new EVs by 2015 and 5 million by 2020. Initial sales were much lower than expected, while most output was purchased for public fleets. New incentives were issued in 2014, with a sales target of 160,000 units for 2014. This goal was also not achieved. The Chinese government uses the term new energy vehicles (NEVs) to designate plug-ins and electrics. Only EVs are eligible for purchase incentives. See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v The Chinese government has put forward the strategy of \"Energy Saving and Electric Vehicles\". The policy measures of this strategy mainly focused on carrying out pilots to subsidize EV buyers, promoting charging facilities construction and accelerating EVs commercialization. On 1 June 2010, the government announced a trial program to provide financial incentives in five cities. A 2013 joint announcement by the National Development and Reform Commission and finance, science, and industry ministries offered a maximum of toward the purchase of a BEV passenger vehicle and up to US$81,600 for electric buses.

The deal included funding 250 fast charging stations and subsidies for the first 500 private buyers of any electric approved by the EU. The first 50 i-MiEVs were delivered in October 2011, for use by municipal social workers. Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 34 in 2015 to 85 in 2018, after a stagnation in 2016 and 2017. At the first half of 2019, 42 new BEV were sold, representing 0.2% of the overall sales. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Total of new battery electric vehicles registered per year !Year !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !SEM 1 2019 |- |Total new BEV registrations |34 |35 |26 |85 |42 |- |% of total new registrations |not available |not available |0.1% |0.3% |0.2% |} Estonia's figures are low compared to other advanced economies, attributed to lack of government incentives after the carbon credit scheme was exhausted. ==Ecuador== The offer and demand for electric vehicles in the South American nation is reduced. Electric charging stations are currently being built in Guayaquil, Quito, Cuenca, and Loja. In Ecuador, all electric vehicles are exempt from customs duties and taxes starting in June 2019. The electric vehicle offer in the country is set to increase. The Ecuadorean government has been incentivizing the us of electric vehicles with tax cuts. However, both the offer and demand remained short, encouraging the government to eliminate all duties to electric vehicles. == European Union overview == Evolution of annual registrations of plug-in electric passenger cars in Europe between 2011 and 2019. Europe had more than two million plug-in electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in circulation at the end of April 2020. See infograh \"Inmatriculations de V\u00e9hicules Electrifi\u00e9s Neufs Union Europeenne + AELE - Janvier-Avril 2020\" - As of April 2020, there were 1,117,330 all-electric vehicles and 910,525 plug-in hybrids in circulation in Europe (total in use is 2,027,855 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles). , Europe accounted for 25% of the global stock, the second largest stock after China.

These goals are part of the Finnish government efforts to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Basic charging infrastructure is available all over Finland, used for winter engine pre- warming. Because of its climate \u2013 cold winters and warm summers \u2013 Finland is considered a convenient \"test laboratory\" for electric cars. Many companies in Finland are involved in next-generation vehicle manufacturing, including Valmet Automotive, Fortum (concept cars and infrastructure), Vacon (electric motor technology production), Ensto (production of charging units), Elcat (electric vehicle production since the 1980s), Raceabout (specialist electric sport car with very few sales). Research related to electric cars is in progress at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Tekes.Tekes Electric car organisations in Finland include the Electric Vehicle Association of Finland and Electric Vehicles Finland. A non-commercial electric car conversion organisation is called Electric Cars - Now! that converts Toyota Corollas into Li-ion battery-powered electric cars. ==France== Registration of light-duty plug-in vehicles in France by type of vehicle between 2010 and 2019. , cumulative registrations of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles in France totaled 305,061 plug-in cars and electric utility vans delivered since 2010, consisting of 240,032 all-electric passenger cars and utility vans, and 65,029 plug-in hybrids.

The electric utility van segment has been led by the Renault Kangoo Z.E. with over 21,000 units sold through February 2019. The registration of new all-electric cars (BEV) increased from 184 units in 2010 to 32,203 units in 2018, 1.4% of the new car registration. During the first half of 2019, 21,024 new BEV were registered, representing 1.8% of the new car sales. In 2008, France established a bonus-malus system offering a purchase incentive for low emission cars and a penalty fee (malus), for the purchase of high-emission vehicles. See Chapter 3 - Car Registration Tax ('Bonus-Malus' system) in France pp. 15-21. In 2015, the government introduced an additional bonus for all-electric car purchasers who scrapped a diesel-powered car in circulation before 1 January 2001. , the scrappage bonus had been granted for more than 10,000 purchases. ==Germany== Annual registration of plug-in cars in Germany by type of vehicle between 2010 and 2019. , cumulative registrations in Germany totaled 305,787 plug-in electric passenger cars since 2010, consisting of 168,396 all-electric cars and 137,391 plug-in hybrids. A total of 29,436 plug-in hybrids and 25,056 all-electric cars were registered in Germany in 2017. See the tab Kraftsoffarten: A total of 45,348 plug-in hybrids (market share 1.3%) and 63,321 all-electric cars (market share 1.8%) were registered in Germany in 2019. In addition, Germany had a stock of 21,890 light-duty electric commercial vehicles in 2019, the second largest in Europe after France. , the country had 4,800 public charging stations. With 108,839 plug-in passenger cars registered in 2019, Germany was the top selling country market in the European continent in 2019, with sales up 60.9% from 2018. The plug-in car segment achieved a market share of 3.10% in 2019. The Smart electric drive led the plug-in electric car segment in Germany until 2013. Cumulative number of registered electric cars was 12,156 as of 1 January 2014. Under its National Platform for Electric Mobility, Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2010 set the goal of putting one million electric vehicles on German roads by 2020. Initially, the government did not provide subsidies in favor of research. The Bundestag passed the Electric Mobility Act in March 2015 that authorized local government to grant non-monetary incentives. The measures privilege battery- powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some PHEVs, by granting local governments the authority to offer additional incentives. The introduction of the purchase bonus noticeably impacted sales only in September 2016, when registrations grew to 3,061 units. A total of 17,074 plug-in cars were registered in Germany between January and September 2016, consisting of 7,678 BEV cars and 9,396 PHEVs. An incentive scheme was approved in April 2016 including purchase subsidies, charging stations and another federal government fleet purchases, with a target of 400,000 electric vehicles. Premium cars, such as the Tesla Model S and BMW i8, were not eligible. , BMW, Citro\u00ebn, Daimler, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo had signed up to participate in the scheme. The online application system to claim the bonus went into effect on 2 July 2016. == Greece == Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 35 in 2015 to 88 in 2018. At the first half of 2019, 104 new BEVs were sold, representing 0.16% of the overall sales. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Total of new battery electric vehicles registered per year !Year !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !SEM 1 2019 |- |Total new BEV registrations |35 |9 |47 |88 |104 |- |% of total new registrations |not available |not available |0.05% |0.09% |0.16% |} In June 2020, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the government's plan to support the adoption of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) by individuals and corporations, with the aim for one-in-three new vehicles in Greece to be electric by 2030. The plan includes purchase subsidizing, exemption from the road tax and any parking fees, as well as incentives for setting up charging stations, for pure electric private passenger cars and motorbikes, as well as for pure electric or plug-in hybrid taxis and light commercial vehicles. The government's subsidy covers the purchase of new BEVs and PHEVs with a total of 100 million euros for 18 months in the first phase, which is estimated to cover 25% of the cost of about 14.000 new electric vehicles. The government will subsidize the purchase of each new electric vehicle, covering 15% of its cost (up to \u20ac5.500) for private passenger and light commercial vehicles, 20% of the cost (up to \u20ac800) for motorbikes and 25% of the cost (up to \u20ac8.000) for taxis. Vehicle owners that will concurrently retire their old vehicle will receive an additional bonus of up to \u20ac2.500. Furthermore, expenses for charging the electric car will be exempt from taxable income. The benefit for each new electric car, if combined with the ecological bonus and the relevant tax exemptions, will approach 10.000 euros. ==Hong Kong== As of December 2017, 10,666 plug in vehicles were registered in Hong Kong. March 2017 saw 2,964 EVs registered in one month before first registration tax exemption was repealed. 2,939 of these cars were Tesla Model S and X. Tesla Roadster charging at Central Star Ferry carpark in Hong Kong. , 6,298 plug-in vehicles were on the roads in Hong Kong, up from 3,253 in October 2015. The plug-in segment market share achieved 4.8% of new car sales in Hong Kong in 2015. , more than 1,200 public electric vehicle charging points were available. More than a dozen models were available for retail customers. Sales of electric cars took off in Hong Kong with the Tesla Model S in 2014. About 70% of the electric cars in Hong Kong roads by the end of Sept 2016 are Tesla Model S cars (~1,720 units). The tax waiver made the Model S competitive in the luxury car segment, at about half the price of other high- end models. According to Tesla, , Hong Kong had the world's highest density of Tesla superchargers, giving most Model S owners a supercharger within a 20-minute drive. The Government offered purchase incentives to consumers, businesses and service providers were available from 2011 to 2017. The Government further allocated million for bus companies to purchase 36 electric buses. ==Hungary== In November 2018, 8,482 PEVs were registered in Hungary. The Hungarian government introduced its e-mobility plan in March 2014. The Jedlik plan supported the domestic production of electric vehicles, expanding the necessary infrastructure and promoting the purchase of EVs with public incentives, including 1.5 million HUF, initiated at the end of 2016. Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 115 in 2015 to 1300 in 2018.

Conversion of some vehicles to electric drivetrains was introduced during the APEC Meeting in October 2013. ==Ireland== Sales of electric cars in Ireland increased more than four times in 2014 from a low base. Then, sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 466 in 2015 to 1233 in 2018. At the first half of 2019, 1954 new BEV were sold, representing 2.4% of the overall sales. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Total of new battery electric vehicles registered per year !Year !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !SEM 1 2019 |- |Total new BEV registrations |466 |392 |622 |1233 |1954 |- |% of total new registrations |not available |not available |0.5% |1.0% |2.4% |} The government committed to making 10% of all vehicles by 2020 (a projected 230,000 vehicles). Government officials reached agreements with French car maker Renault and its partner Nissan. , purchase incentives became available. As of the start of 2020, Electric Vehicles (EVs) was as a proportion of all cars for sale in Ireland very small, which could be seen in a snapshot (7 February 2020) of four different car sales websites (Autotrader.ie, Carsireland.ie, Carzone.ie, and Donedeal.ie) which showed that out of circa 38,000 to 70,000 cars listed for sale, only circa 0.7% to 1.1% were EV's, so in real terms only 431-616 EV cars were advertised for sale in the market. This very low level of EVs compared poorly to the circa 25,338 to 46,940 diesel cars shown available for sale on the same date, representing a much larger, circa 64-67% of the market at that time. The Irish Government (to January 2020) had stated an aim to ban the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid new (\u2018non-electric\u2019) cars from 2030 (compared to the proposed EU ban by 2040, and the UK's proposed ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035 as announced in the first week of February 2020) though car dealers were reported in 2020 to consider the Irish Government's target for one million electric and plug-in hybrid cars to be in use by 2030, as far too ambitious, though Government grants of up to \u20ac10,000 also available (as of 2020)(The Irish Times, 7 February 2020). It was also reported (The Irish Times, 7 February 2020) in the Irish newspapers in February 2020 that there were at that time about 1,200 electric car (EV) charging points in Ireland, but that this was compared to Norway, the European leader in EV transition, with approximately 12,000 charging stations for circa 300,000 EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). A compromise in terms of transition and non- electric ban implementation around 2030 maybe for acceptance also of Hybrid cars with smaller conventional petrol engines (regardless of whether the vehicles are \u2018Full\u2019 or \u2018Mild\u2019 hybrids) of for example at/ less than 1.6litre (1600cc) capacity, and/ or say less circa 100g/km CO2 or less in terms of emissions, or a good fuel efficiency rating (L/100 km ) for Highway/Extra Urban and \u2018Combined\u2019 journeys. == Italy == BMW i3 patrol car of the Italian police at Vatican City. over 6,100 plug-in cars were registered, consisting of 4,580 BEV cars and 1,550 PHEVs. The top EV in 2015 was the Nissan Leaf (390 units sold). About 10,000 electric vehiclesThe source does not specify if these include all PEV or only BEV were sold in Italy in 2018, double the 2017 number of about 5,000. Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 1442 in 2015 to 4996 in 2018. At the first half of 2019, 5040 new BEV were sold, representing 0.5% of the overall sales. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Total of new battery electric vehicles registered per year !Year !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !H1 2019 |- |Total new BEV registrations |1442 |1373 |2022 |4996 |5040 |- |% of total new registrations |not available |not available |0.1% |0.3% |0.5% |}The government discontinued incentives in 2014 amid a limited public charging infrastructure and tepid reception. Further, many Italian houses were equipped with electric contracts allowing only 3 kW of peak consumption, making home charging of electric cars impractical. ==Japan== The Nissan Leaf is the top selling plug-in car in Japan ever, with close to 140,000 units sold by February 2020. , Japan had a stock of plug-in passenger cars of 294,000 units on the road, consisting of 152,320 all-electric cars (51.8%) and 141,680 plug-in hybrids (48.2%). See Statistical annex, pp. 247\u2013252 (See Tables A.1 and A.12). The global stock of plug-in electric passenger vehicles totaled 7.2 million cars at the end of 2019, of which, 47% were on the road in China. The stock of plug-in cars consist of 4.8 million battery electric cars (66.6%) and 2.4 million plug-in hybrids (33.3%). In addition, the stock of light commercial plug-in electric vehicles in use totaled 378 thousand units in 2019, and about half a million electric buses were in circulation, most of which are in China. The fleet of electric light commercial vehicles in use totaled 8,720 units in 2019. Sales totaled 24,690 units in 2016, rose to 54,100 in 2017, and then declined to 49,750 in 2018, and fell to 38,900 in 2019. The segment market share declined from 0.68% in 2014 to 0.59% in 2016, and recovered to 1.1% in 2017, but drop to 0.9% in 2019. About 56,000 plug-in electric cars were sold in Japan in 2017. See pp. 5\u20137, 12\u201322, 27\u201328, and Statistical annex, pp. 49\u201351. The decline in plug-in sales reflects the governmental and domestic carmaker decision to promote hydrogen fuel cell vehicles instead. In May 2009 the Japanese Diet passed the \"Green Vehicle Purchasing Promotion Measure\". The program provided purchasing subsidies for cars, mini and keis, trucks and buses, including an extra subsidy for purchases trading in a sufficiently old used car. See pages 45\u201346. The program ended on 31 March 2010. The Japanese electric vehicle charging infrastructure climbed from 60 public stations in 2010 to 1,381 in 2012. Mitsubishi introduced multiple plug-in vehicles: the Mitsubishi i MiEV in 2009, the Mitsubishi Minicab MiEV in 2011, a truck version of the Minicab MiEV and the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV in 2013. The Nissan Leaf launched in 2010. The Toyota Prius PHEV was released in January 2012. The Leaf is Japan's all-time best-selling plug-in car, with about 140,000 units delivered by February 2020. Prius PHEV sales since inception totaled about 61,200 units up to December 2018. A total of 52,013 plug-in cars were sold in Japan in 2018, with a market share of 1.0%. The Nissan Leaf was the top selling plug-in model with 25,722 units, followed by the Prius PHEV with 12,401 units. , the Outlander PHEV had sold 42,451 units. See tables in pp. 3-4. Sales of the Outlander PHEV fell sharply from April 2016 as a result of Mitsubishi's fuel economy scandal. == Kosovo == There have not been much effort in by Kosovo of using Plug-in electric vehicles. However ProCredit Bank, Kosova, became the first institution in Kosovo to use electric vehicles, by buying 10 new Mitsubishi i-MiEV vehicles. In 2017, six teens in the city Gjakova, from BONEVET makerspace, became the first European teenager group to build an electric car out of a Renault Twingo, transforming it from a petrol-fuelled car to a fully functional electric car. == Latvia == Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 17 in 2015 to 73 in 2018.

Electric vehicles are exempt from all non-recurring vehicle fees, making electric cars price competitive with conventional cars. BEVs are exempt from the annual road tax, public parking fees and toll payments (including domestic ferries), as well as given access to bus lanes. Plug-in hybrids have a smaller market share than ZEVs because they are not eligible for the same incentives. In 2013 the government reduced taxes for to improve PHEV sales. The initial 50,000 vehicle target was reached on 20 April 2015 at a cost of up to 4 billion krone (around ). The Government decided to continue the incentives through 2017, although the Parliament phased out some of the incentives. , 24 out of 58 major municipalities kept the free parking for EVs. Among the 34 municipalities that terminated the benefit, six kept different variants of partial free parking. In 2016, the government proposed its National Transport Plan 2018-2029 (NTP) with the goal that all new cars, buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 should be zero emission vehicles. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.
