DCU is known for its academic strength, especially in the field of medical, pharmacy, health science, psychology, social science, education etc. ==History== The St. Justin Seminary, from which the university claims descent, opened in Daegu on November 1, 1914, having been founded in May of that year. The first four rectors of the school were French missionaries, the first being a Fr. Chargeboeuf, also known by his Korean name Song Duck-mang (\uc1a1\ub355\ub9dd). The first Korean rector, Fr. Choi Min-sun (\ucd5c\ubbfc\uc21c), who took up the post in 1945, was also the last rector of the seminary, which closed due to the turbulent events of that year, sending most of its students home in May but remaining open until December to allow the final class of 4 to graduate. In 1952, the Hyosung Women's Junior College (\ud6a8\uc131\uc5ec\uc790\ucd08\uae09\ub300\ud559) was established, offering instruction to 150 students in the fields of music, literature, and home economics. The following year, it became a four-year college, also offering instruction in pharmacology. The college continued to expand steadily in the following years, establishing its graduate school in 1972 and gaining university status in 1980. ==International relations== Catholic University of Daegu maintains international relations with 68 universities in 19 countries: The ASEAN International Mobility for Students (AIMS) programme member * SEAMEO RIHED === IFCU member=== *International Federation of Catholic Universities === ASEACCU member=== *The Association of South East Asian Catholic Colleges and Universities === Australia === *Australian Catholic University === Canada === *The University of Alberta ===China=== *China National Academy of Fine Art *China Sichuan Normal University *ChongQing University of Arts and Sciences *Guangdong University of Foreign Studies *Guizhou Normal University *Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine *Jilin University *Luoyang Normal University *Nanjing Normal University *Shandong Economic University *Shandong University *The Central University of Nationalities *Jiangxi Normal University *Yanbian University *Zibo Vocational Institute === France === *Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille === Germany === *Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg === Hungary === *Ferenc Liszt Academy of Music === Indonesia === *Universitas Nasional *Atma Jaya Yogyakarta University *Atma Jaya Indonesia Catholic University, Jakarta *State University of Malang *Indonesia International Institute for Life Science === Italy === *Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera *Conservatorio di Musica S.
