    "text": "John Charles Blay, born on 5 October 1944, is an Australian writer and naturalist who has written extensively about the Australian bush and its people in drama, prose and poetry. His work unveiling local landscape has had many consequences including, in 1982, discovering a new species of wattle, Acacia blayana, named in his honour. == Personal life == Blay was born in Parramatta, NSW, Australia and lived in the inner city of Sydney until 1970 when he moved to a spotted gum forest at Bermagui, on the far south coast of NSW, a move detailed in his memoir, Part of the Scenery. In following years his immersion in the wild forests and understanding of their wildlife led to him receiving the inaugural Parks Writer Award to spend 12 months alone in wilderness areas of the region. This has period extended over the years along with his understanding of the south-eastern region. He is also interested in using native plants in sustainable gardening, as in The Australian Native Plant Gardener's Almanac. Since 2001, he has researched the Bundian Way, an ancient Aboriginal pathway, in association with local Aboriginal communities and as the Bundian Way Project Officer for Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council. His researches and bushwalks while investigating this traditional route resulted in its official recognition and NSW Heritage listing in 2012.NSW Government Office of Environment and Heritage http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5060185 He is an acknowledged authority on the landscapes and history of south-eastern Australia. His understanding \"of the varying country\" of the shared history Heritage pathway between the highest part of the Australian continent and the coast is demonstrated in his book, On Track: Searching out the Bundian Way. == Style == Blay's prose focuses on place, bringing together human and physical landscape with historical influences.Ray Ericksen, Habitat, Australian Conservation Foundation, 1988 June, P. 32 http://ourpix.biz/ourpix/references/newspapers/Habitat- Ray%20Erikson%20review%20Back%20Country%201988%20June%20SM.jpg Blay's work reflects not only his expertise across literary formsDavid Malouf, Cover endorsement, On Track, John Blay, NewSouth, Sydney 2015 but also his understanding of the human experience. His writings about his bushwalking experience include a spiritual odyssey, and uncover significant history associated with the track, as well as describing the difficulties of long- distance walking. The third part of the trilogy, Wild Nature, was published in August 2020 by NewSouth. It is at once a natural history of the region and an examination of the values of its national parks and their role in sustaining nature. His work has also extended to sound sculpture. The sculptural installation, Les St Hill and the Tin Canoe that included his oral history of a WW1 veteran recorded at Bermagui in 1975, won the $10,000 major prize at the Lake Light Sculpture Jindabyne in Easter 2018. The judges said: \"It was a unanimous decision by the judges, as it extended the definition of what sculpture can be and might be. We loved its animation of space, the way it captured interest and invited pause, and loved the way it connected with the Snowy Mountains and the whole idea of storytelling and oral histories. \"It is a piece that could sit anywhere in the world, very professional and well resolved work, and a fabulous piece of public art \u2013 with a beautiful use of sound, and a beautiful use of the solar energy around to push that forward. We did not expect to see this here.\"Lake Light Sculpture, the Pride of Jindabyne.
