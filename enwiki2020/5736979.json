    "text": "Map of the Prairie Pothole Region of North America (U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center) Barringer Slough in Iowa, a remnant of the extensive prairie wetlands that once covered the region. The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is an expansive area of the northern Great Plains that contains thousands of shallow wetlands known as potholes. These potholes are the result of glacier activity in the Wisconsin glaciation, which ended about 10,000 years ago. The decaying ice sheet left behind depressions formed by the uneven deposition of till in ground moraines. These depressions are called potholes, glacial potholes, kettles, or kettle lakes. They fill with water in the spring, creating wetlands, which range in duration from temporary to semi- permanent. The region covers an area of about 800,000 sq. km and expands across five U.S. states (Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, and Montana) and three Canadian provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta). The hydrology of the wetlands is variable, which results in long term productivity and biodiversity. The PPR is a prime spot during breeding and nesting season for millions of migrating waterfowl. == Hydrology == Few natural surface water drainage systems occur in the region as pothole wetlands are not connected by surface streams. They receive most of their water from spring snowmelt and precipitation. Some pothole wetlands also receive groundwater inflow, so they typically last longer each year than those that only receive water from precipitation. Shorter-duration wetlands fed only by precipitation typically are sources of groundwater recharge. The hydrology of the potholes is very variable, responding to changes in precipitation and groundwater, and results in regular wet-and-dry cycles. == Vegetation == The vegetation of the PPR consists of emergent plants and tall grasses, while the prairie surrounding the region has dense grassland vegetation. The composition of a local plant community is heavily affected by the amount of water available. In wetter wetlands that retain water through the summer, the common plant is hard-stem bulrush, along with soft-stem bulrush and common threesquare in slightly drier regions of the wetlands. The vegetation in permanently flooded wetlands is more aquatic; duckweeds, pondweeds, aquatic buttercups, and aquatic smartweeds are some of the most common. In drier wetlands of the PPR, the vegetation varies from spikerush, which is found in the wetter areas of the wetland, to foxtail barley and wheatgrass on the outer edges of the wetland. The variable availability of water in the Prairie Pothole Region is buffered by an abundant seed bank under the soil, comprising species that thrive under different water regimes. During times of drought, shortgrass species increase and expand their range, while during wetter periods, tallgrass and mixed prairie communities become more common. == Wildlife == The Prairie Pothole Region provides important habitats for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife, supporting more than 50% of North America's migratory waterfowl.The Prairie Pothole Region, archived copy of page from former National Biological Information Infrastructure website The Prairie Pothole Region is one of North America's most important areas for duck reproduction. Although the region contains only about one-tenth of the continent's habitat area for breeding of waterfowl, roughly half the primary species of game ducks on the continent breed there. The region accounts for more than 60% of the breeding populations of mallard, gadwall, blue-winged teal, northern shoveler, northern pintail, redhead, and canvasback ducks.Austin, Jane E. 1998. Highlight Box: Waterfowl in the Prairie Pothole Region. Pages 456-457 in M. J. Mac, P. A. Opler, C. E. Puckett Haecker, and P. D. Doran, eds. Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources, Vol. 2. Jamestown, ND: Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center Online. (Version 21JAN2000). The waterfowl time their breeding around the wetlands in this region. They use the wetland as their primary breeding grounds. == Threats == The location of the PPR is the main reason as to why the wetlands are in danger. More than half of the potholes have been drained and converted to agriculture, causing pothole loss upwards to 90% or more in places. As agriculture has expanded around the area the potholes were drained. The remaining wetlands of the region are feeling the effects from the surrounding agriculture. The runoff from chemicals, excess sediment, and nutrient flow into the potholes causes irreparable damage. Climate change is another big culprit for the decline of the PPR. Climate change has caused more of the wetlands to dry earlier in the year. This affects the migration pattern for waterfowl that time their breeding to the seasonal presence of water in the PPR. Climate change has caused more wetlands to become seasonal wetlands as the increase in temperature is drying more and more wetlands. This has caused ripple effects within the migratory waterfowl breeding pattern as they use the wetlands as their primary breeding grounds. Decline in the Prairie Pothole Region, due to climate change and agriculture, will affect the migrating and breeding habits of waterfowl in that area. == References == == External links == * * * * America\u2019s Grasslands: A Threatened National Treasure Documentary produced by Prairie Public Television * Land-use Change, Economics, and Rural Well-being in the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States United States Category:Regions of the Western United States Category:Prairies Category:Regions of North Dakota Category:Regions of South Dakota Category:Geography of Alberta Category:Geography of Manitoba Category:Geography of Saskatchewan Category:Geography of Iowa Category:Geography of Minnesota Category:Geography of Montana ",
