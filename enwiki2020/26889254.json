    "text": "Eastbourne Performance is a live album by American pianist, composer and band leader Duke Ellington featuring his final recorded concert at the Congress Theatre in Eastbourne, England in December 1973 and released on the RCA label in 1975. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4\u00bd stars and states \"The Ellington Orchestra was a bit weaker than it had been (many of the veterans had either died or retired) but it was still a mighty outfit... Actually the most impressive soloist on the album (which has yet to be reissued on CD) is Ellington himself... A fitting ending to a truly remarkable career\".Yanow, S.
