    "text": "Chas Jankel is the debut solo studio album by the English singer and multi- instrumentalist Chaz Jankel. It was originally released in 1980, on the label A&M.; Ian Dury and The Blockheads's first and only album without Jankel, Laughter, was released the same year. The first track on the album \"Ai No Corrida\", was covered by Quincy Jones a year later in 1981 and was a UK chart hit for him. The song has also been covered by the Nylons and Laura More with Uniting Nations. The album was re-issued in 2005 on Angel Air in the United Kingdom as a digitally remastered CD, featuring one bonus track, \"Little Eva\" which was co-written by Jankel with Ian Dury and was originally released on Jankel's 1985 album Looking at You. The track \"Reverie\" was used as a sample by Brooklyn-based hip hop collective Pro Era in the song, \"Like Water\", which is featured on the group's second mixtape as a collective, \"P.E.E.P: The aPROcalypse\" (2012). ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. *Chaz Jankel \u2013 lead and background vocals; guitar; keyboards; synthesizer; percussion *Mark Isham \u2013 soprano saxophone; trumpet; synthesizer *Chris Hunter \u2013 alto saxophone; tenor saxophone *Peter Van Hooke \u2013 drums; percussion *Chris Warwick \u2013 synthesizer programming; percussion *Kuma Harada \u2013 bass guitar on \"Just a Thought\", and \"Lenta Latina\" *Paul Westwood \u2013 bass guitar on \"Ai No Corrida\" ;Production team *Chaz Jankel \u2013 producer; sleeve concept *Peter Van Hooke \u2013 producer; inner sleeve photography *Mark Isham \u2013 producer *Chris Warwick \u2013 producer *Chris Jenkins \u2013 engineer *Mick Glossop \u2013 engineer *Philip Bagenal \u2013 engineer *Steve Prestage \u2013 engineer *Michael Ross \u2013 art direction *Simon Ryan \u2013 design *Mike Putland \u2013 back cover photography ==See also== * List of albums released in 1980 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 debut albums Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Chaz Jankel albums ",
