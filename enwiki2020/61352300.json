When he was 6 years old, his family moved to Sha'arei Tikva. When he was 12 his mother died of cancer and two years later his family returned to live in Petah Tikva.

Plotnik began to write amateur rap in the wake of his childhood hero, Subliminal. He wrote extensively about his childhood and the beginning of his work in Petah Tikva, especially on his third album, \"Welcome to Petah Tikva\". His stage name was derived from the Amharic word \"Nech\" (\u1290\u132d, meaning: white), most of Plotnik's childhood friends were Ethiopians and called him so affectionately.
