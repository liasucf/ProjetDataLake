Linda Lindroth with her work in her studio; photo used with permission of Graham Hebel == Trickster in Flatland == In 2011 Lindroth began her Trickster in Flatland series, exploring the subject of American commerce during the early part of the twentieth century by photographing the tattered remains of small boxes that contained products once invented and manufactured in the United States. These artifacts, chosen for their design elements and materiality, offer up evidence of the level of skill and anonymity of their makers. The work is strongly influenced by constructivist and abstract expressionist painters of the first 50 years of the century. Lindroth lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut, and has been an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut since 1998. ==Bibliography== *Ballerini, Julia. \"Exhibitions.\" Julia Ballerini.
