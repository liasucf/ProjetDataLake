In April 2015, Delancey formed a joint venture with LRC Group in a project to redevelop the Royal Mint Court office near the Tower of London. The deal followed lengthy negotiations after LRC acquired a loan secured on the site's leasehold in May 2014. Delancey's DV4 fund had owned the freehold interest since 2010. In February 2015, Delancey revealed it was poised to sell its 102,000 square foot office at scheme at Orchard Brae House in Edinburgh as the firm looked to capitalise on numerous leasing deals at the building in the preceding 12 months. In January 2015, Delancey and commercial property developer Barwood partnered to launch a new industrial and logistics developer, with the aim of providing competition to its rival firms like SEGRO and Prologis in the sheds market. In May 2012, Delancey advised Brazilian business magnate Moise Safra on his \u00a3500 million purchase of an office building in London's financial district from the consortium, One Plantation Place Unit Trust. In 2011, Delancey and Qatari-owned Qatar Diar acquired 1,400 apartments in the Olympic Village area near the venue of the London 2012 Olympics for a fee of \u00a3557 million. The acquisition attracted some controversy as it occurred during the time of the economic crisis, with the property market at a low point. Built to house 23,000 athletes and officials during the games, the properties were sold to Delancey and Qatar Diar before the games had even started. Also during the Olympics, Delancey's joint venture with Infinity SDC, ICITY, was contracted to convert the Olympic broadcast and press centre into a tech hub for corporations, with BT Group as the first major tenant. ==References== Category:Property companies based in London Category:Real estate companies established in 1995 Category:British companies established in 1995 ",
