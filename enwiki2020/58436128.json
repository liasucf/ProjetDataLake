He was just 12-years-old when he played for the Carrigaline junior hurling team in the league and made his championship debut two years later in 1948. On 8 September 1974, Cooney was captain of the Carrigaline junior team that defeated Tracton by 3-10 to 2-06 in the South East Championship final. After playing his last game for Carrigaline in 1977, Cooney transferred to the Fermoy club. He retired from club hurling after a 40-year career in 1986. ===Inter-county=== ====Minor and junior==== Cooney first played for Cork at minor level in 1952.

On 1 October 1955, Cooney was at midfield when he won his first All-Ireland medal after a 6-10 to 0-02 defeat of Warwickshire in the final. Over the following few seasons Cooney was a regular member of the Cork junior team and won a second Munster Championship medal in 1958 after a 6-09 to 3-05 defeat of Waterford in the final. On 5 October 1958, Cooney won a second All-Ireland medal following Cork's 7-1- to 4-02 defeat of Warwickshire in the final. ====Senior==== Cooney made his first appearance for the Cork senior hurling team on 23 November 1958 in a 4-05 to 2-03 National Hurling League defeat by Waterford.
