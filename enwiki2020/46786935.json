Violoncello Concerto: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved May 24, 2015. ==Composition== Similar to Rouse's previous Violin Concerto, the Violoncello Concerto is composed in two movements: #Combattimento #Adagiati The movements are titled from the works of innovative Renaissance/Baroque composer Claudio Monteverdi. Additionally, the piece contains quotes from Monteverdi's opera L'incoronazione di Poppea and William Schuman's song Orpheus with his Lute. Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Conqueror Worm\" was also placed in the score as a motto for the piece. ===Inspiration=== Rouse described the Violoncello Concerto as a \"meditation upon death\" in response to the passing of several colleagues and fellow composers. In the program note to the score, Rouse wrote: ==Reception== Reviewing the world premiere, Edward Rothstein of The New York Times praised \"marvelous effects\" of Rouse's composition, despite noting its somber tone. Rothstein further remarked, \"The danger in his style is partly that the anger and despair can seem motivated by events outside the music more than by events within it. But when it works -- as it does in his Violin Concerto and in the Cello Concerto -- one is drawn into Mr. Rouse's emotional universe and is moved by its craft as well.\" Conversely, Ivan Hewett of BBC Music Magazine was much more critical and referred to the concerto as \"mediocre music.\" ==References== Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:1992 compositions Rouse Category:20th-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic ",
