It was caused by the resignation for health reasons of the constituency's MSP, Sam Galbraith. The Labour Party retained the seat with Brian Fitzpatrick winning for them. He faced a strong challenge from Dr. Jean Turner who stood as an \"independent\" candidate trying to save the local Stobhill Hospital. Turner would later stand against Fitzpatrick at the 2003 election for the Scottish Parliament and defeat him. ==Result== ==Scottish Parliament Election result, 1999== ==See also== *Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency) *Elections in Scotland *List of by-elections to the Scottish Parliament ==External links== *Scottish Election Results 1997 - present Category:2001 in Scotland Category:2000s elections in Scotland Category:Politics of East Dunbartonshire Category:2001 elections in the United Kingdom Strathkelvin 2001 Category:21st century in East Dunbartonshire Category:June 2001 events in the United Kingdom ",
