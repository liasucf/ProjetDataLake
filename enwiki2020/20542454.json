    "text": "Sillas River is a non-existent river believed by Megasthenes (c. 350 BC-290 BC) (a Greek traveller and geographer who visited India during the third century BC) to be flowing in India. According to Magasthenes, this river was peculiar since nothing cast into it would float but strangely would sink to the bottom. Magasthenes had mentioned it in his book - Indika. No such river has been ever found in India or elsewhere. ==References== Category:Mythological rivers Category:Rivers of India ",
