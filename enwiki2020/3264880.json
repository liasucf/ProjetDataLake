    "text": "Finally Out of P.E. is the debut and only album by American actress and singer Brie Larson, released on October 18, 2005, by Casablanca. The album features 13 tracks, some of which were co-written by Larson, and focuses on the ups and downs of being a teenager. In an interview, Larson stated, \"I think that I write about stuff that others don't write about. I don't have a bunch of love songs cause I don't really have much boy experience. I just write about what I am actually going through in my real life. That's where the title from my album comes from \u2013 Finally out of P.E. My P.E. teacher didn't like me at all, which was hard to deal with cause I was usually such a teachers' pet. So when I found out I got my record deal, I was like, 'Yes, I'm finally out of P.E.\"\" The song \"Hope Has Wings\" was featured on the 2005 animated film Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus. ==Commercial performance== Due to many delays in release dates, the album was expected to be released in the fall 2004, However, the album was later released on October 18, 2005.
