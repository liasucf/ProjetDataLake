    "text": "The 2018 World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series was the 40th season of the winged sprint car series sanctioned by World Racing Group, competing throughout the United States. The season began with the DIRTcar Nationals at Volusia Speedway Park on February 9, and ended with the World of Outlaws World Finals at The Dirt Track at Charlotte on November 3. Donny Schatz defended his 2017 championship by winning his tenth title in 2018. The 2018 season was the first to feature live video broadcast of every event available via pay-per- view on DIRTvision. The season was marred by the death of Jason Johnson, following the race at Beaver Dam Raceway on June 23.http://woosprint.com/news/latest-news/5090-jason-johnson-succumbs-to- injuries-sustained-at-beaver-dam-raceway == Teams and drivers == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! !Race driver !Team !Chassis !Rounds |- |rowspan=2| 0 | Bud Kaeding | Williams Motorsports | Maxim | |- | Andy McElhannon | | | |- | 1a | Jacob Allen | Shark Racing | Triple X | |- | 1AJ | Trevor Mell | | | |- | 1J | Danny Jennings | | | |- | 1k | Kyle Larson | Kyle Larson Racing | RPM | |- |rowspan=2| 1M | James Moughan | | | |- | Phillip Mock | | | |- | 1s | Logan Schuchart | Shark Racing | Triple X | |- | 1x | Scott Hunter | | | |- | 2 | Shane Stewart | Kyle Larson Racing | RPM | |- | 2A | Austin Pierce | | | |- | 2b | Billy Chester | | | |- | 2ks | Austin McCarl | | | |- | 2m | Kerry Madsen | Big Game Motorsports | | |- | 2s | Nathan Skaggs | | | |- | 2W | Scotty Neitzel | | | |- | 2X | Brian Smith | | | |- |rowspan=4| 3 | Sammy Swindell | | | |- | Jac Haudenschild | | | |- | Dakota Jackson | | | |- | Tim Kaeding | | | |- | 3c | Tanner Thorson | TRI-C Motorsports | Spike | |- | 3P | Sawyer Phillips | | | |- |rowspan=2| 4 | Parker Price-Miller | Destiny Motorsports | Triple X | |- | Kasey Kahne | Kasey Kahne Racing with Mike Curb | | |- | 4B | Steve Butler | | | |- |rowspan=2| 4k | Kasey Kahne | Kasey Kahne Racing with Mike Curb | | |- | Kody Kinser | | | |- | 4s | Danny Smith | | | |- | 4x | Eric Schulz | | | |- | 5 | David Gravel | CJB Motorsports | TI22 | |- | 5A | Justin Barger | | | |- |rowspan=3| 5B | Chase Briscoe |rowspan=4| Chase Briscoe Racing |rowspan=4| | |- | Logan Seavey | |- |rowspan=2| Christopher Bell | |- | 5C | |- |rowspan=2| 5H | Michael \"Buddy\" Kofoid | | | |- | Andy Teunessen | | | |- | 5J | Jeremy Schultz | | | |- | 5QB | Quentin Blonde | | | |- | 5w | Lucas Wolfe | Lucas Wolfe Racing | | |- |rowspan=2| 5x | Kory Bates | | | |- | Justin Peck | | | |- | 6N | Greg Nikitenko | | | |- |rowspan=2| 7 | John Carney | | | |- | Carson McCarl | | | |- | 7k | Cale Conley | Dave Jessup Racing | | |- |rowspan=2| 7S | Tim Kaeding |rowspan=3| Sides Motorsports |rowspan=3| Maxim | |- |rowspan=2| Jason Sides | |- | 7SS | |- | 7W | Tasker Phillips | | | |- | 7X | Critter Malone | | | |- | 8 | Jack Croaker | | | |- | 8H | Jade Hastings | | | |- | 8s | Steve Short | | | |- | 9 | Daryn Pittman | Kasey Kahne Racing with Mike Curb | RPM | |- | 9JR | Derek Hagar | | | |- | 9N | Wade Nygaard | | | |- | 9P | Rager Phillips | | | |- | 9X | Paul Nienhiser | | | |- | 00 | Dane Lorenc | Lorenc Racing | | |- | 01 | Matt Vandervere | | | |- |rowspan=2| 05 | Gary Taylor | Loyet Motorsports | | |- | Colin Smith | | | |- | 07 | Gerard McIntyre | | | |- | 09 | Matt Juhl | | | |- | 10 | Matthew Moles | SPF Racing | | |- | 10h | Chad Kemenah | Hunter Racing | Maxim | |- | 10P | Jim Perricone | | | |- | 10TRB | Bob Martin | | | |- | 10V | Matt Vandervere | | | |- |rowspan=2| 11 | Max McGhee |rowspan=2| McGhee Motorsports |rowspan=2| | |- | Dominic Scelzi | |- | 11k | Kraig Kinser | Steve Kinser Racing | DRC | |- | 11R | Chase Ridenour | | | |- |rowspan=2| 12 | Robert Ballou | Robert Ballou Motorsports | Boss | |- | Lynton Jeffrey | | | |- | 12N | Cole Duncan | | | |- | 12W | Dale Wester | | | |- | 13 | Clyde Knipp | Clyde Knipp Racing | Maxim | |- | 13JT | Mark Dobmeier | Jimco Motorsports | Eagle | |- | 13x | Paul McMahan | Buch13 Racing | | |- |rowspan=4| 14 | Jason Meyers | H.P.
