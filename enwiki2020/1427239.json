    "text": "Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s Riascos (Bogot\u00e1, Colombia 16 December 1934) is a Colombian-born American neuroscientist. He is currently the Thomas and Suzanne Murphy Professor of Neuroscience and Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Physiology & Neuroscience at the NYU School of Medicine. Llin\u00e1s has published over 800 scientific articles. ==Early life== Llin\u00e1s was born in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. He is the son of Jorge Enrique Llinas (a surgeon) and Bertha Riascos. He was motivated to study the brain by watching his grandfather Pablo Llin\u00e1s Olarte working as a neuropsychiatrist. Llin\u00e1s describes himself as a logical positivist.P. (2016). Rodolfo R. Llinas - Can Science Talk God? Retrieved August 26, 2016, from https://www.closertotruth.com/series/can- science-talk-god ==Education and early research== Llin\u00e1s went to the Gimnasio Moderno school in Bogot\u00e1 and graduated as a medical doctor from the Pontifical Xavierian University in 1959. During his medical studies he had the opportunity to travel to Europe and there he met several researchers in Spain, France and finally Switzerland, where he participated in neurophysiology experiments with Dr. Walter Rudolf Hess, Nobel Prize in Physiology, Medicine, professor and director of the Department of the Institute of Physiology of the University of Zurich. Additionally, while studying medicine he made a theoretical thesis on the visual system under the tuition of neurosurgeon and neurophysiologist Fernando Rosas and the mathematician Carlo Federici at the National University of Colombia. He received his PhD in 1965 from the Australian National University working under Sir John Eccles. ==Personal life== By graduation in Australia, he was very interested in the biological basis of the mind. During this time he met his future wife who was studying philosophy. His two sons are also physicians and his wife is an Australian philosopher of mind. Llin\u00e1s was a scientific advisor during the establishment of an interactive science museum located in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia called Maloka Museum. Recently, Llin\u00e1s has donated a T-Rex skeleton to the museum and helped to design a model of the nervous system for the dinosaur fossils. ==Work== He has studied the electrophysiology of single neurons in the cerebellum, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampus, the vestibular system, the inferior olive and the spinal cord. He has studied synaptic transmitter release in the squid giant synapse. He has studied human brain function using magnetoencephalography (MEG) on the basis of which he introduced the concept of Thalamocortical dysrhythmia. ==Career== Llin\u00e1s has occupied a number of positions. *Research fellow, Massachusetts General Hosp.-Harvard University, 1960\u201361 *National Institutes of Health research fellow in physiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 1961\u201363 *Associate professor, University Minnesota, Minneapolis, 1965\u201366 *Associate member, American Medical Association Institute Biomed.
