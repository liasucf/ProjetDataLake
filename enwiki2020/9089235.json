    "text": "Prolinol is a chiral amino-alcohol that is used as a chiral building block in organic synthesis. It exists as two enantiomers: the D and L forms. ==Preparation== Prolinol is obtained by reduction of the amino acid proline using lithium aluminium hydride. Because proline is cheaply available in high optical purity, enantiomerically pure prolinol is also widely available. ==Use== Prolinol is used in broad variety of chemical reactions as chiral ligand, chiral catalyst or chiral auxiliary reagent in the Hajos\u2013Parrish\u2013Eder\u2013Sauer\u2013Wiechert reaction, the Baylis\u2013Hillman reaction, Noyori type reactions and the Michael reaction. ==See also== * Enantioselective synthesis ==References== Category:Primary alcohols Category:Pyrrolidines ",
