    "text": "First Dutch Reformed Church, also known as the \"Old Church on the Green\", is located in Hackensack, New Jersey. ==History== It sits in the churchyard of the church by the same name, the current building being constructed in 1791. The east wall of the building is of particular interest because it incorporates several carved stones from the first church building erected on the site. These stones bear the monogram of several of the founding families. The Congregation was founded by Dutch Settlers in 1686. For the first ten years the congregation worshipped in various locations, and in 1696 the first building was built on the current site. In 1780 Colonial General Enoch Poor was buried in the Cemetery. George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette attended the funeral.Photographic Inventory: Hackensack First Reformed Church, accessed August 7, 2006.
