    "text": "Robert Edeson (June 3, 1868 \u2013 March 24, 1931) was an American film and stage actor of the silent era and a vaudeville performer. Edeson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of manager and actor George R. Edeson. After working as treasurer of the Park Theatre in Brooklyn, he initially acted in New York in 1887 in a production of Fascination. He debuted on Broadway in Marriage (1896). His last Broadway appearance was in The World We Live In (1922). He also performed in vaudeville. Edeson received his first boost in films in 1914 when he starred in the Cecil B. DeMille directed film, The Call of the North (1914). Edeson replaced actor Rudolph Christians in Erich von Stroheim's production of Foolish Wives (1922), after Christians died of pneumonia. Edeson famously only showed his back to the camera so as not to clash with shot footage of Christians that was still to be used in the completed film. Edeson's final film was Aloha (1931). His third wife was the former Aida Banker. On March 24, 1931, Edeson died at his home in Hollywood. He was 62 years old. ==Selected filmography== Fathers of Men (1916) *The Paymaster's Son (1913) as The Paymaster's Son *The Call of the North (1914) as Ned Stewart *The Absentee (1915) as Nathaniel Crosby *The Light That Failed (1916) as Dick Hedlar * Big Jim Garrity (1916) as Jim Garrity *On the Night Stage (1915) as Austin *The Caveman (1915) as Hanlick Smagg *Public Defender (1917) as Arthur Nelson *Extravagance (1921) as Richard Vane *Foolish Wives (1922) as Andrew J.
