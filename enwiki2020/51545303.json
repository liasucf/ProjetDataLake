It premiered at the Mardi Gras Film Festival on February 15, 2018 and was released in the United States on June 29, 2018. ==Plot== Erasmus (Coogan) and Paul (Rudd) are a gay couple whose life is turned inside out when a ten-year-old boy, Bill, shows up at their door claiming to be Erasmus's grandson. Erasmus is a famous chef and Paul is the producer of his cooking show, and they live in a large showplace house in New Mexico. Bill's father, Beau, was the result of a one-time heterosexual encounter, and Erasmus has never met him or Bill. Beau has been jailed on drug charges and instructed Bill to find his grandfather. Erasmus and Paul come to embrace parenthood, although Paul does most of the heavy lifting. Beau attempts to get clean in jail, and tells Erasmus and Paul that he plans to take Bill out of state once he is released. When Bill says he would rather stay with the couple, Erasmus consults a lawyer. He is told that it's unlikely he'll get custody unless Bill is in immediate danger from his father. Erasmus and Paul try to enjoy the holidays with Bill and the time they have left with him. After Beau shows up to take Bill, Erasmus invites him in hoping to change his mind; later that night, Beau takes Bill and leaves without saying goodbye. Erasmus and Paul's relationship has been strained, and Paul tells Erasmus that he plans to take a job with Rachael Ray's show in New York. Erasmus seems indifferent at first but jumps in front of Paul's car and begs him to stay. Paul goes as far as the airport, but turns back and they reconcile. Beau gets into a drunk-driving accident with Bill in the car, and Erasmus and Paul are awarded custody. ==Cast== * Steve Coogan as Erasmus Brumble, Beau\u2019s father, Bill's grandfather and a TV chef * Paul Rudd as Paul Morgan, Erasmus's director and long-term partner * Jack Gore as Angel/Bill Brumble, Erasmus's estranged grandson * Alison Pill as Melissa from Child Protective Services * Jake McDorman as Beau Brumble, Bill\u2019s father and Erasmus\u2019 son * Jesse Luken as Director * Eric Womack as Officer Forrest * Jenny Gabrielle as Betty * Lora Martinez-Cunningham Ms. Garcia * Monique Candelaria as Officer Guttierez * Frances Lee McCain as Doris ==Production== Andrew Fleming directed the film from his own script with producers on the film are Aaron Ryder, Gabrielle Tana, Maria Teresa Arida, Clark Peterson, and Maxime R\u00e9millard.
