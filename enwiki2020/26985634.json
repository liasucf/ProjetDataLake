Anders Melander was a composer working for the Swedish TV and a theatre director at Angeredsteatern. He was also much earlier a member in the progg band Nationalteatern. Niklas Hjulstr\u00f6m on the other hand was an actor. The two had cooperated before working on a song and Anders knew Hjulstr\u00f6m was a skilled singer. So when Anders needed a singer to sing \"Burnin'\", a song composed by him for the Swedish TV series \"Glappet\", he asked Hjulstr\u00f6m and they formed together a band called Cue. Although not strictly intended for release as a hit, just usage for the TV series, the song gained popularity and upon release as the first single for Cue, it hit the Swedish charts at #1 for 4 weeks (14 November to 12 December 1997. It eventually sold 90,000 copies making it one of the most successful singles in the 1990s in Sweden.Rate Your Music page on Cue It also reached #4 in Norway and #9 in Finland. When Hjulstr\u00f6m's work at Angeredsteatern ended, it was an opportune time for the duo to release in 2000 their first album Cue and a second single from the album entitled \"Crazy\". A second album followed in 2006 entitled Guide in Blue where both Anders Melander and Niklas Hjulstr\u00f6m wrote songs. Eventually Cue became more of a Hjulstr\u00f6m solo project besides his new work as director and art leader at the theatre Folkteatern. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! colspan=\"4\"| Chart positionsswedishcharts.com - Cue - Cue |- ! width=\"40\"| SWE |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2000 |align=\"center\"| Cue |align=\"center\"| 8 |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2006 |align=\"center\"| Guide in Blue |align=\"center\"| 24 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! colspan=\"4\"| Chart positions |- ! width=\"40\"| SWE ! width=\"40\"| NOR ! width=\"40\"| FIN ! width=\"40\"| NLD |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 1997 |align=\"center\"| Burnin' |align=\"center\"| 1 |align=\"center\"| 4 |align=\"center\"| 9 |align=\"center\"| - |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 2000 |align=\"center\"| Crazy |align=\"center\"| 9 |align=\"center\"| 14 |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |- |align=\"center\"| SwayCue (2) - Sway (CD) at Discogs |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2002 |align=\"center\"| Hello |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| 85 |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2006 |align=\"center\"| Take Me Home |align=\"center\"| 38 |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2011 |align=\"center\"| StayAmazon.com: Stay: Cue: MP3 Downloads |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2012 |align=\"center\"| Don't Wanna LieAmazon.com: Don't Wanna Lie: Cue: MP3 Downloads |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |align=\"center\"| - |} ==References== Category:Swedish pop music groups ",
