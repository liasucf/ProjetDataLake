Jinx was purchased for $600 (f.o.b. Africa) from a Miami, Florida, pet shop when he was 2 months old. \u201cWe had no idea of going into show business. We just wanted a pet\u201d, explained Darlene Sellek in an interview during one of the act's Ice Capades appearances in 1957.Chicago American, \"World\u2019s 1st Chimp on Ice Is Real Cool\", 13 Apr 1957 ==Performing career== Jinx and Darlene first appeared as an act at \u201cThe Homecoming\u201d in Dekalb, Illinois, in August, 1954, when Jinx was 10 months old.The Hinckley Review, \"A Surprise Act\", 12 Aug 1954 Jinx showed off his ability to walk a tightrope upside down and blindfolded. 4 months later, the act \u2013 billed as \u201cDarlene and Jinx\u201d \u2013 performed at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis, where the pair began a significant relationship with the major American circus impresario and director Al Dobritch. In late January, Darlene started to train Jinx to ice skate, with the help of Baptist Schreiber, who is better known for his training of elephants. A few other show-business chimpanzees in the world were known to roller skate, but Jinx was the first to skate on ice. He first appeared on ice skates in the \u201cHollywood Ice Review\u201d at Chicago Stadium in February, 1955, with the World and Olympic Ice Skating Champion Gundi Busch. The relationship with Al Dobritch provided a number of bookings at various Shriner Circuses around the USA over the next few years, the first of which was the Zuhrah Shriner Circus in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the end of February, 1955. The spring of 1955 found Darlene and Jinx in New Orleans at Pontchartrain Beach, working alongside Runyon and Edwards, and \u201cDaddy Longlegs\u201d, the man with the longest legs in the world.New Orleans Times- Picayune, \"Chimp Heads Three-Act Program at Beach Today\", 9 Apr 1955 By June, 1955, Al Dobritch had negotiated a television contract for the act; Darlene and Jinx had signed a 3-year contract with \u201cSuper Circus\u201d television show, produced in Chicago for station WBKB, \u201cChicago\u2019s Family Station\u201d.Billboard, \"\u2018Super Circus\u2019 Adds Chimp to Regulars\", 2 Jul 1955 While with Super Circus, Jinx worked with the children's television pioneer Claude Kirchner and the ever popular Mary Hartline. Darlene and Jinx were forced to leave the show after only 5 months when the production moved from Chicago to New York in November, 1955. Jinx visited New York for the first time in late 1955 when Darlene appeared on the What\u2019s My Line? television game show (Game 2, Season 7, Episode 282), hosted by John Daly. During that visit, Jinx was inducted into the American Airlines \u201cSky Cradle Club\u201d for the flight from New York to Chicago in November, 1955.Houston Chronicle, \"The Show Goes On\", 11 Nov 1955 In November, 1955, Jinx began regular appearances with Ned Locke on the \u201cCaptain Hartz and His Pets\u201d television show produced in Chicago for television station WMAQ, sponsored by the Hartz Mountain pet care company. (Jinx first appeared with Ned Locke as his WMAQ radio disc jockey assistant \u2013 the world's first chimpanzee radio personality.)
