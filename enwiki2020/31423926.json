    "text": "First produced in 1962, the Agfa Optima 1a or Agfamatic was one of the first fully automatic scale-focusing 35mm film cameras. The successor to German camera manufacturer Agfa's Optima 1 camera, the camera employed a selenium cell that generated a voltage related to the luminance, to both measure the light level and to provide the power required for automatic setting of aperture and shutter speed. Other features included a flash mode which overrode the automatic mode to set the camera shutter speed to 1/30s, and a bulb mode for long exposures.http://blia-gear.blogspot.ae/2012/12/agfa- optima-1a.html ==References== == External links== * Optima on Camera-wiki.org * Agfa Optima 1a at Lomography, examples of photographs Category:135 film cameras Category:Agfa cameras Category:Products introduced in 1962 ",
