    "text": "The Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580 (1884), also referred to as Edye v. Robertson, were a group of cases decided together by the United States Supreme Court. ==Background== Pursuant to the Immigration Act of 1882, officers from the customhouse in the Port of New York began collecting a tax from ships of fifty cents for each immigrant on board who arrived at Ellis Island. Multiple ship owners sued because they were transporting Dutch immigrants, and the Netherlands had a treaty with the United States that seemed to prohibit the tax. ==Decision== The case established the precedent that treaties, which are described in the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution as \"the supreme law of the land\" equal to any domestic federal law, do not hold a privileged position above other acts of Congress. Hence, other laws affecting the \"enforcement, modification, or repeal\" of treaties are legitimate. ==See also== *Passenger Cases: A similar case covering a head tax on British immigrants. *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 112 ==External links== * * Category:1884 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:United States Treaty Clause case law Category:Netherlands\u2013United States relations Category:Ellis Island Category:United States immigration and naturalization case law Category:Poll taxes ",
