It was founded in 1986 and is one of the six networks with national coverage. == History == The channel 13 frequency ranging between 210 and 216 MHz (NTSC-M system) in Lima was initially operated by Panamericana Televisi\u00f3n that remained at that frequency until 1965, when it changed to frequency of channel 5 (76-82 MHz). Later that frequency was assigned to the University of Lima and donation of equipment by Panamericana Televisi\u00f3n, \"Panamericana de Teleducaci\u00f3n - Canal 13\" is founded, which operated the frequency until 1974, when the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado decided to close. In 1983, with a discrete advertising campaign in Lima, Favorita de Televisi\u00f3n - Canal 13 announced the start of its operations for 1984 but never materialized. By late 1985 and early 1986, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Radiodifusora Univisi\u00f3n S.A. (unrelated to US Hispanic network Univisi\u00f3n), which was then known as SIN) launched a test signal for a few months. Due to problems in importing their equipment, the Peruvian government withdraws the operating license to the nascent corporation in 1989 to finally assign it to Empresa Radiodifusora 1160 S.A. who initially operated UHF channel 33 (Stereo 33) and moved it to 13 (now Red TV). On July 1, 1986, it started broadcasting on UHF channel 33 as Stereo 33 Televisi\u00f3n, using the then-new stereo technology. The switch to VHF 13 happened at the start of 1989 and, in 1990, it was sold to Vittorio de Ferrari. During this transitory phase, it was known as Canal 13. The name Global Televisi\u00f3n was adopted in 1991 in time for the launch of their satellite connections in order to cover the whole country. It wasn't considered a \"hot\" channel and most of their programming was imported content. In 1995, Vittorio de Ferrari signs a deal with Antena 3 and started to show their productions as well as imported films and cartoons. Following the death the channel's owner, his son, Roberto de Ferrari, revokes the contract with Antena 3 and sold it to Genaro Delgado Parker. The name changed to Red Global. At this stage, it showed programming from his production company, Astros. Said production company and Julio Vera Abad entered a dispute over the ownership of the channel over payment issues. In July of that year, Genaro and Vera Abad confronted each other at the entrance of Astros, suspending all newscasts on the channel. Cesar Hildebrandt briefly involved with the channel in 2001, but after discovering a Vladivideo (home videos where Vladimiro Montesinos bribed politicians and owners of companies) where Genaro negotiated Hildebrandt's maintenance with Montesinos, he quickly left. The channel was sold in 2006 to CORPECON, a company associated with ATV, under the intention to revert the channel's crisis. Genaro Delgado Parker left Red Global by selling the remaining 50% to Albavisi\u00f3n-owned Grupo ATV. Having assumed complete control of the channel, their headquarters move to a location adjacent to the main headquarters of ATV, and rebranded it in November 2010 as Global TV. In April 2015, the channel teased a rebrand, revealed on April 13, where the channel became known as Red TV. On March 27, 2017, the channel was replaced by NexTV. Due to Grupo ATV\u2019s brand license with Am\u00e9rica Televisi\u00f3n being expired. The network which was currently known as America Next became Global Televisi\u00f3n on December 1, 2019. However, America and ATV\u2019s syndication deal (which included Televisa programs licensed to channel 4) expired one year later. == Programming == Red TV's programming is mostly imported.
