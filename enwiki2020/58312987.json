In 2020, Tapp won the sixth series of the ITV2 reality series Love Island. Prior to appearing on the show, Tapp was a semi-professional football player for non-league club Oxford City, having previously played as a professional for Milton Keynes Dons. ==Club career== ===Milton Keynes Dons=== Tapp joined Milton Keynes Dons' academy at the age of 8, progressing through various age groups and into the club's development squad. On 10 November 2016, whilst still an academy player, Tapp was named as a substitute for the first team's EFL Trophy group stage fixture against Norwich City. After coming on as a 76th-minute substitute, Tapp scored in the 84th-minute in an eventual 4\u20131 defeat. Tapp signed professional terms with the club on 17 May 2018, signing a one-year deal with an option of a further year. He made his professional debut for the club on 28 August 2018, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3\u20130 EFL Cup second round defeat away to Premier League side Bournemouth. Following limited first team opportunities during the first half of the 2018\u201319 season, Tapp joined seventh-tier club Staines Town until January 2019. Tapp was later one of ten players released by Milton Keynes Dons at the end of the season. ===Oxford City=== On 19 July 2019, following a successful trial, Tapp joined National League South club Oxford City. ==Outside football== ===Love Island=== In January 2020, it was announced that Tapp would join the sixth series of ITV2 dating programme Love Island, the first series to feature a winter villa, located in Cape Town, South Africa. Tapp entered the villa on Day 5. On 23 February 2020, Tapp along with fellow participant Paige Turley were voted the show's winning couple by the UK public and shared a \u00a350,000 prize. Tapp contested the show without permission from Oxford City, which the club's commercial director called a breach of contract. ===Personal life=== Since January 2020, Tapp has been in a relationship with Paige Turley, whom he met during the sixth series of Love Island. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Milton Keynes Dons ||2016\u201317 |League One |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearances in EFL Trophy.||1||1||1 |- ||2018\u201319 |League Two |0||0||0||0||1||0||2||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!3!!1!!4!!1 |- |Staines Town (loan) |2018\u201319 |Southern Premier South |9||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||2 |- |Oxford City |2019\u201320 |National League South |20||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||22||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !29!!3!!2!!0!!1!!0!!3!!1!!35!!4 |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:People from Milton Keynes Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Milton Keynes Dons F.C. players Category:Participants in British reality television series Category:Staines Town F.C. players Category:Oxford City F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
