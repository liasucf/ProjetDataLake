    "text": "Joseph Zobel (April 26, 1915 in Martinique \u2013 June 18, 2006 in Al\u00e8s, France) is the author of several novels and short-stories in which social issues are at the forefront. Although his most famous novel, La Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres, was published some twenty years after the great authors of Negritude published their works, Zobel was once asked if he considered himself \"the novelist of Negritude\".Warner, Keith Q., 1979. Foreword: We All Had a M'man Tine. Black Shack Alley, 1996. == Biography == === Literary Beginnings and Influences === Joseph Zobel grew up with the support and unconditional love his grandmother and his mother. His mother, Delia, was forced to work as a nanny for a B\u00e9k\u00e9s (white Creoles) family, the Des Grotte family, in Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique. Young Zobel was a brilliant student, earning himself a scholarship that allowed him to pursue an education and finish high school. After finishing his high school studies, he had hoped to study architecture in Paris. Unfortunately, he did not have the funds or another scholarship to help pay for such endeavors. Instead, he got his first job with the Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests which forced him to move closer to the water in South Martinique, specifically to the towns of Diamant and Saint-Esprit. \u201cJoseph Zobel\u201d, sur \u00cele en \u00cele, le site des litt\u00e9ratures insulaires francophones (CUNY). His time in Diamant and Saint-Esprit allowed him to become well acquainted with the local fishermen and to learn more about their lifestyle, which would later influence his popular novel La Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres. Despite gaining an appreciation for the lifestyle on the coast, he couldn't forget the values he grew up with in the more rural inland of Martinique. During World War II, there was a blockade on the French West Indies preventing anybody, including Zobel, from leaving Martinique or traveling to France. \u201cJoseph Zobel\u201d, sur \u00cele en \u00cele, le site des litt\u00e9ratures insulaires francophones (CUNY). While he was in Martinique, he worked as a teacher and then a school master of Lyc\u00e9e Victor-Sch\u0153lcher, a boarding school in Fort-de- France. In the meantime, he found ways to express himself by writing short stories. His friends would read the stories for him. One friend, a fellow physical education teacher, brought the stories to a newspaper called Le Sportif who published the stories with popular success. The Martiniquais appreciated Zobel\u2019s stories because they accurately portrayed the habits and customs of the island and its people without exaggerating the exoticism of their lifestyle. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, a young agr\u00e9g\u00e9 at the time, taught in the same high school as Zobel. He had an appreciation for Zobel\u2019s writings and encouraged him to write a novel. Inspired by his experience working in the village of fishers in Diamant, Zobel wrote Diab\u2019-l\u00e0 in 1942. It was a story about a peasant who decided to win his freedom by working the land near a community of fishermen. When Zobel first wanted to publish the novel, Martinique was governed by Admiral Robert, an authoritarian representative of the Vichy government, delaying publication until 1947.V\u00e9ronique Larose, \u201cPawol Kreyol\u00bb.

In Sorbonne, he took courses in literature, dramatic art, and ethnology. Additionally, he earned a position as an assistant professor at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ois 1er de Fontainebleau. Settled in Fontainebleau with his wife and three children, Zobel devoted the 1950s to intense literary activity and writing. He published numerous novels such as Les Jours Immobiles and La F\u00eate \u00e0 Paris. He also wrote many poems which he recited at various festivals in France, Switzerland, and Italy. Most notably, in 1950, Zobel published one of his principle works, La Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres, a story greatly influenced by his childhood and time in Martinique. The story recounts a child, without much experience in the world, and a grandmother, who is experienced but softens her perspective of the world, resulting in a rare testimony to the West Indian Black community at the time. The \u00c9ditions Albin Michel refused to publish the text because of the Creole-inspired phrases. It was Alioune Diop who finally published La Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres in his newly created publishing house and magazine, Pr\u00e9sence Africaine. The novel proceeded to go down in history in France and in the African continent.Kidi Bebey, \u201cLa Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres passe par la case bande dessin\u00e9e\u201d, Le Monde, 30 March 2018.V\u00e9ronique Larose, \u201cPawol Kreyol\u00bb.

He was recruited to become a college director by the Senegalese Minister of Education, Amadou Matar M\u2019bow, as a college director at school of Ziguinchor (at present the Lyc\u00e9e Djignabo) in Casamance. After a few years as a general supervisor of the Van Vollenhoven school in Dakar, he became a producer of educational and cultural programs at the Radio of Senegal. His programs were heard throughout French-speaking West Africa. Some anecdotes of his experiences in Dakar are recounted in the collections of short stories Mas Badara (1983) and Et si la mer n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bleue (1982).\u201cL'\u00e9crivain Joseph Zobel est mort\u201d, L'Obs, 19 June 2006. === Retirement and Final Publications === Retiring in 1974\u201cL'\u00e9crivain Joseph Zobel est mort\u201d, L'Obs, 19 June 2006., Zobel settled in the village of G\u00e9n\u00e9rargues where he continued to write and even rewrite some novels: Les Jours Immobiles became Les Mains pleines d\u2019oiseaux and La F\u00eate \u00e0 Paris became Quand la neige aura fondu.V\u00e9ronique Larose, \u201cPawol Kreyol\u00bb.

In 1995, Zobel published D\u2019Amour et de Silence, an art book of watercolors and some unpublished poems and extracts from his personal journal. His final publications were published in 2002: Gertal et autres nouvelles, a novel combining unpublished texts and extracts from his personal journal which he held from 1946-2002; Le Soleil m\u2019a dit, a complete poetic work.V\u00e9ronique Larose, \u201cPawol Kreyol\u00bb.

The novel is an account of a young boy raised by his grandmother in a post-slavery - but still plantation- based - Martinique. The struggles of the impoverished cane-sugar plantation workers, and the ambitions of a loving grandmother who works hard to put the main character through school are the core focus of the novel, which also describes life in a colonial society. Zobel stated that the novel was his version of Richard Wright's Black Boy (1945) in that they are both semi- autobiographical. The novel was adapted for the screen by Euzhan Palcy in 1983 as Sugar Cane Alley. While La Rue Cases-N\u00e8gres is Zobel's most renowned work, the author started his writing career in 1942 during World War Two with Diab- la (a tentative English title could be \"The Devil's Garden\"), a socially conscious novel similar to Jacques Roumain's Masters of the Dew (published a year or more later). With Diab-la, Zobel tells the powerful story of a sugar- cane plantation worker freeing himself from colonial exploitation by creating a garden in a fishermen's village of Southern Martinique. Leaving Martinique in 1946 to pursue ethnology and drama studies in Paris, Zobel spent some years in Paris and Fontainebleau, before relocating to Senegal by 1957. Writing a few short stories, he had a notable impact in the cultural life of French- speaking West Africa as a public radio producer. A noted poet and a gifted sculptor as well as a writer, Zobel retired to a small village in southern France in 1974 and died in 2006. == Bibliography == * Bishop, Marie-France, et al. \u201cJoseph Zobel.\u201d Dictionnaire Des \u00c9crivains Francophones Classiques : Afrique Subsaharienne, Cara\u00efbe, Maghreb, Machrek, Oc\u00e9an Indien, H.
