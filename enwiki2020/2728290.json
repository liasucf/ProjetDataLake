(John Heaton had operated KGIX from 1930 to 1935, but low power and limited hours made it unprofitable.) For much of its early history, KENO broadcast out of the El Rancho Vegas on Las Vegas Boulevard. Southern Nevada's first radio show was called \"Listen Ladies\" and was hosted by Laura Belle Kelch. Listen Ladies provided home and household advice to women in the 1940s. The station played top 40 from the 1950s to the early 1980s, using the slogan \"Music Radio 1460\" in the 1960s and 70s. KENO also had and FM station at 92.3, until 1982 when it changed its call sign to KOMP and began playing album- oriented rock. KENO 1460 switched to AC/oldies in the early 1980s and then went to the straight oldies format in the latter part of the decade around 1987 and 1988. The oldies format lasted until 1993. KENO was originally on 1370 kHz. Under the NARBA treaty of March, 1941 it moved to 1400 kHz. It moved to 1460 kHz in 1951. Prior to switching to Spanish, KENO was the Las Vegas affiliate of the Jim Rome Show. The station was the flagship station for the Las Vegas 51s, then the Class AAA affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. On March 3, 2008, the station changed its format to ESPN Deportes Radio, and the previous programming was moved to KBAD 920 kHz. KBAD's programming was moved to 1100 kHz, KWWN. KENO is the flagship station for Spanish-language broadcasts of the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League. In 2017, an agreement was made for KENO to broadcast select Golden Knights games which made the Golden Knights the third team in the NHL to offer Spanish-language radio broadcasts. KENO is the flagship station for Spanish-language broadcasts of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League. The station started carrying the games in 2020 and is the flagship for a group of eight stations across Nevada and California carrying Raider games in Spanish. ==References== ==External links== *FCC History Cards for KENO ENO Category:Radio stations established in 1940 Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:History of Las Vegas Category:Lotus Communications stations Category:Vegas Golden Knights broadcasters Category:Las Vegas Raiders broadcasters ",
