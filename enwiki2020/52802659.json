Edward uncertainly get his eyes on Kara and she will soon taste the bitterness and cruelty of her twin sister. Rivalry arises between them with both twins fighting for their rights and ownership. But even so, Kara's love for her sister is unconditional as she gives everything to Sara to make her happy and satisfied, even knowing her sister has started to be more evil. In few times later, Kara uncovered her feelings for Edward and realized for herself that she doesn't see him beyond a friend. She meets her new savior, Sebastian (Sam Milby), who stopped her from committing suicide and helped her with her family problems. They became best friends and now it is Edward who seeks attention to Kara and gets envious of Sebastian. Sara later promised Edward that she will always be there for him. Sara began to be much more materialistic and scheming, and persistently fights for her rights as the \"legal daughter\" of Antonio (Allen Dizon). This later started a hefty and exasperating rivalry between Sara and Lucille (Carmina Villarroel). Sara started to covet for highly luxurious properties, desiring to outclass Kara for all the lavishness she used to have, and even induced Antonio to buy her own house to make up for all those years she suffered in scarcity. After the struggles that Kara has faced, every pieces of their family's secrets are finally discovered by Lucille who had known nothing about her family's well-kept secrets because of Sara's intentional declaration and evil schemes. Even her mother, Barbara (Alicia Alonzo), pretends innocently and blames Kara for falling down from a stair. Lucille was saddened by these turn of events, but chose to forgive her family and wanted them to move with her to America again for a fresh start. Unfortunately, Lucille's revenge returns and aggravates when Antonio dies in a car accident and her road to revenge is nearly arriving and she couldn't stop until she finds justice for the death of her husband. This enabled Sara to pay for her evil schemes she had caused against her family and Lucille as well. It becomes worse for Lucille when another secret from her mother is about to shock her when she meets her conniving and two-faced half-sister Alex (Maxene Magalona) and half- brother Sebastian. Lucille ordered a demolition around the area where the Suarez family lives and forcefully expelled Sara to the house which Antonio gave her. In consequence of the casualty, Ishmael (Ariel Rivera) who was badly wounded in the head and needed medical operation for his condition. Kara and Sara, nowhere to look for money, had no choice but to confront Lucille and demanded the \"donation\" which their late father left for them. Lucille displeasingly tells the twins that Antonio didn't left any money for them and this created a weird suspicion behind Sara's mind. The twin sisters confronted the attorney and fellow friend of Antonio, and upon their surprise the attorney had finally confessed that he was actually blackmailed by Lucille to hide the inheritance which Antonio left for his daughters. Kara and Sara were given a corresponding amount of money of ten million each and used these for Ishmael's operation. == Cast and characters == === Main === * Julia Montes as Kara Dela Rosa Acosta and Sara Suarez Ligaya * Carmina Villarroel as Lucille Acosta-Dela Rosa * Mylene Dizon as Laura Hipolito-Suarez * Ariel Rivera as Ishmael Suarez * Sam Milby as Sebastian \"Seb\" Acosta === Supporting === * Allen Dizon as Antonio Dela Rosa * Alicia Alonzo as Barbara Acosta * Edgar Allan Guzman as Edward Ligaya * Gloria Sevilla as Anita * John Lapus as Pacito \"Itoy\" Delgado * Anjo Damiles as Andrew \"Andy\" Delgado === Recurring === * Alora Sasam as Camille Rose \"CR\" Sanchez * Loren Burgos as Olivia Ou * Patricia Javier as Chloe Cabrera * Michael Conan as Emilio * Jason Fernandez as Jhayson * Chrisha Uy as Jessica * Chiqui del Carmen as Lourdes * Joe Vargas as Elvis * Yesha Camile as Mikay * Amy Nobleza as Bebeng *Savant Grant as Isabella Bella D.
