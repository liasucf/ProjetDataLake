The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a fusion of a rotated lowercase letter with a letter . Approved in 1928, the symbol represented a sound intermediate between and or between and until 1979 when its value was redefined as an alveolar lateral flap. Some languages that are described as having a lateral flap actually have a flap that is indeterminate with respect to centrality, and may surface as either central or lateral, either in free variation or allophonically depending on surrounding vowels and consonants. ==Features== Features of the voiced alveolar lateral flap: ==Occurrence== ====== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !
