She grew up in a household that was frequented by leading artists and calligraphers., Bio Article by Nasser Zarif Shafik], reverbnation.com. Retrieved 26 January 2016. . Najat was singing at family gatherings from the age of five. She made her first film, Hadiya (released in 1947) at the age of eight., Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper, 2007/06/27, Issue No.10468, Arabic Article \"Najat Al Saghira owner of the loud salience). , Al- Ahram Arabic newspaper in Egypt, 2012/12/06, Issue No. 46021: \"Brother of Nagat El Saghira and Soad Hosni: I taught singing to Nagat \u201c, by Ahmad Al Samehi.\" She is reported to have performed songs by the diva, Umm Kulthum, from the age of 7 years.Zuhur, S., Asmahan's Secrets: Art, Gender and Cultural Disputations Arab Women and the Media, Vol. 88, Winter 2000; Al-Raida Journal, vol. 88, 2016, pp 41\u201344, DOI:10.32380/alrj.v0i0.606 Along with Umm Kulthum, she was one of a small group of female singers who formed the Egyptian \u201cgolden age\u201d of music in the 1940s, \u201950s and \u201960s.Stars Illustrated Magazine, New York, Times Square Press, 2018, p. 80; El Sayed, S., Folk Songs Features accompanying Shaa'by dancing of Reda's Group, Cairo: Helwan University, Faculty of Musical Education, 2000, pp 39\u201341 She was known as \u201cal-Saghira, the small\u201d or \u201cal-Saghira, the young\u201d. She gained many fans after releasing the song, Irja Ilyya (Return to Me), based on a poem by Nizar Qabbani whose sister had committed suicide rather than enter into an arranged marriage. The song's feminist lyrics struck a chord with fans. During the 1970s, Najat added original lines to the song during 1970s\u2019 performances, demonstrating her capacity for \"inspired interpretation\".Nouraie-Simone, F. (ed), On Shifting Ground: Muslim Women in the Global Era, The Feminist Press at CUNY, 2014, p. 101 In a recorded interview,, Recorded Najat 1960s Interview in the mid-1960s for Egyptian TV with the presenter Ms Salwa Hegzi, Nagat stated that she had, at that time, eight brothers and sisters. Lately, some media outlets are indicating double that number; the most frequently mentioned is seventeen brothers and sisters., British Broadcasting Corporation \"BBC\", 2001/06/28: \"Egyptians mourn screen Cinderella\". The discrepancy between eight and seventeen siblings can be readily explained by the nature of an extended family. Najat is one of eight siblings (four boys: Ezz Eddin, Nabil, Farooq and Sami; and four girls: Khadiga, Samira, Najat herself and Afaf) from her father's first marriage; as well as three half-sisters from her father's second marriage to Gawhara (Kawther, Soad, Sabah). Following Gawhara's divorce from Hosni and remarriage to Abdel Monem Hafez, another six children were born (three boys: Jaheer, Jaser and Jalaa; and three girls: Gehan, Janjah and Jeely). The grand total of 17 is made up of eight full siblings; three half- sisters and six step-siblings. In the same interview, Nagat confirmed that she was brought up in a home where most of her brothers and sisters were artists., Alsharq Al Awsat newspaper, 2001/08/03, No. 8284: Article on Soad Hosni and her family by Mayad Beloun. ==Home of artists== Her father's household was known as \"the home of the Artists\". Leading artists from across the Arab world regularly visited Hosni's home in Khan el-Khalili, Cairo. He nurtured his children's talents and encouraged them to pursue careers in the performing and visual arts.It may be worth noting that some sources, especially Arabic media report, occasionally repeat stories that Hosni was cruel father and denied his daughters an education. These rumours appear to be based on a largely fictionalised TV drama, but have been repeated occasionally in the Arabic media, and in at least one Dictionary of Biography (Ginsberg, T. and Lippard, C., Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema, Scarecrow Press, 2010, pp 181\u2013182). Hosni's son, Ezz Eddin, dismissed these rumours about his family life, stressing that he and his siblings were raised in a supportive and artistic household where their talents were nurtured from a very young age. See: Al-Samahi, A., \"Najat's small brother and Suad Hosni: I learned to Survive Singing\", (Interview with composer, Ezzidin Hosny), Al-Ahram, (Arabic newspaper in Egypt), 6 December 2012, Issue No. 46021, , Online: (translated from Arabic) Many of his children became artists in their own rights. His son, Ezz Eddin Hosni (1927\u20132013) was a noted composer and taught Najat music and singing. Another brother, son Sami Hosni became a Cello player, jewellery designer and calligrapher., Al-Etihad newspaper, UAE, Obituary of Ezz- Eldin Hosni (brother of Nagat El Sagheera). Yet another brother, Farooq, was a painter and his daughter, Samira, also became an actress.Mohammad Qanawi, \"Najat Al Saghira wins 'Al Owais' Prize\", 4 December 2006, Issue No. 10233 The Egyptian actress Soad Hosni (1943\u20132001) was Najat's half-sister. Soad died in London under controversial circumstances. Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people., Arabic newspaper \"Al Bayan\" in Dubai, 2001/06/29: Article about Soad Hosni funeral. Soad Hosni performed in more than 80 films the last of which was released in 1991, and had five marriages and no children. ==Marriages== Nagat had two marriages. Her first marriage was at young age, in 1955, when she was 16 (or 17) years old to an Egyptian man called Kamal Mansi who was a friend of her brother. She was divorced around 1960 and remarried in 1967. Nagat also divorced from her second husband, Egyptian film director Houssam El-Din Mustafa (1926\u20132000), shortly afterwards and has remained single to date. Media reports suggest that she made a decision to devote her life to raising her only child, Waleed, from her first marriage, and to her work. ==Vocal development and style== In the first 10 years of her singing career Nagat imitated other singers. Renowned Egyptian journalist Fekry Abaza (1896\u20131979) demanded the State should support the young gifted Nagat. According to her family that period \"trained\" her voice. However, in 1949, the iconic Egyptian music composer Mohamed Abdel wahab (1902\u20131991) actually filed an official complaint at the Police station against Nagat's father. He claimed that such training hindered the natural process of her voice development and that she should be left alone to develop freely without it. , Arabic newspaper \"Al Watan\" in Qatar, 2012/10/03: Article on Nagat El Sagheera's retirement., 2009/07/20 2 \"Mohammed Abdul-Wahab\", latest update 2015/06/30. Nagat broke away from imitating other singers when she released her own first song in 1955 at the age of 16 years. In the above-mentioned 1960s interview, Nagat herself indicated her first song was \"Why did you allow me to love you?\" Thereafter she released several other songs for Radio stations. Each song had duration of 7 to 8 minutes. She began to deliver \"long-duration\" songs. Each of these songs tells a story and each typically lasts for some 20\u201340 minutes in studio recordings. To hold onto her audience for the longer durations on stage Nagat turned her attention to people like Nizar Qabbani. His classic poetic styles combine simplicity and elegance in exploring themes of love and feminism.\"Nizar Qabbani: From Romance to Exile\u201d, Muhamed Al Khalil, 2005, A dissertation submitted to the faculty of the Department of Near Eastern Studies in partial ulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Graduate College of the University of Arizona, USA., Art and information: text of \u201cMata?\u201d as written by Nizar Qabbani and as sung by Najat Al Saghira., Arabic news channel \"Al Arabiya\" in Saudi Arabia, original Article in December 2006 (latest update: 2011/11/01): \u201cNajat Al Saghira: This is my story with Nizar\u201d.

Nizar Qabbani poems table on page 18 shows four poems sung by Najat Al Saghira all with music by Abdul Wahab: I ask you to go, What am I going to tell him, What does he think (Aydhono) and Mata?. These long duration songs were highly successful. Her rigorous training, lengthy rehearsals in the recording studios and tireless performance on the stage are legendary. In total, Nagat El Sagheera may have recorded more than 200 songs;, Najat songs (about 200 recordings). top 53 of which are available on Apple's iTunes web site, Najat Al Saghira Albums. She built on this success in subsequent years, despite the difficulty of finding new outstanding poems and corresponding music compositions. To combat this shortage, she was forced to rely on her own abilities in performance. For example, in 1976, at the age of 37, she performed several songs in her last film \"Dried Tears\". One of these songs was \"Mata?\" derived from the poem written by Nizar Qabbani with music by Abdul Wahab. The duration of this song in the film was less than ten minutes. In the years that followed, Nagat sang it several times on stage; the last time was in 2002. One of those repeats was in the 1980s when she was in her 40s. In this performance, she extended the delivery of this song from below 10 minutes in the film to about one hour on the stage. Many consider this specific performance on the stage one of her lifetime bests. It was recorded and can be easily found on YouTube., Najat singing \"Mata?\" on stage ==Recognition and legacy== Nagat's stage performances are at the core of her legacy.

(Nagat refers to Najat Al Saghira). one of her distinguished collaborators, indicated in a TV interview that as far as music composers were concerned Najat Al Saghira was the best performer in the Arab world. This indication tallies with the position of her core fans who place her as No.1 in the Arab world. That is ahead of Umm Kulthum (1898\u20131975) who is still widely regarded by many as the greatest Arabic singer in history., Al Ahram Weekly Online, 2001/12/21 \u20132002/01/02, Issue No. 566, \"Umm Kulthoum superstar\" by Youssef Rakha and Nevine El-Aref.

Nagat El Sagheera kick-started the sixties decade with her first long- duration song \"Does he think I am a toy in his two hands? (or in short Arabic: \u201cAyadhonu\u201d)\u201d. It was written by Nizar Qabbani with music by Abdul Wahab. There is an interesting photo of an archived 1960 letter, Syrian History web site (1960 Nizar Qabbani letter to Najat Al Saghira). circulating in the media, addressed to Najat Al Saghira and hand-written by Nizar when he was in China on a diplomatic mission. In this letter he was pressing her to send him the recording of the song upon its release. It was his first with her and an immediate huge success. Besides Nizar Qabbani, other famous Arabic poets and song writers of the 20th century also obliged Nagat; such as Maamoun Shennawi (1914\u20131994) who wrote \"Your love is my life\", his brother Kamal Shennawi (1908\u20131965), Arabic newspaper \"Al Etihad\" in UAE, 2013/10/23.: \"Al Shennawi and Najat\"., Kamel El Shennawi. who wrote \"Do not lie\" and Abdel Rahman el- Abnudi who described her warm soft voice as \"diamond-like\"., English issue of Arabic newspaper \"Al Ahram\" 2014/04/16, \"El-Abnoudi's songs: The heart of Egypt and the Arabs\u201cby Ahmed El-Sayed Al-Naggar; retrieved from ahraonline on 2015/06/30. Nagat, as she herself confirms in that 1960s interview, always sought quality in words. She was extremely cautious with and meticulous in her choice of her lyrics. One example is that she replaced several words in and even deleted possibly more than one line from \u201cMata?\u201d the original poem by Nizar Qabbani before she agreed to perform it. ==Competition== Nagat El Sagheera emerged at a time when the field was already crowded with formidable competitors. From the start of the Sixties, Nagat El Sagheera quickly became a category on her own; separate from all the others. ==Awards== Nagat was honoured and given prizes many times.
