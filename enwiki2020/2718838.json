    "text": "Larry W. Smith, CQ (born April 28, 1951) is an athlete, businessperson and member of the Senate of Canada. He served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from April 2017 until November 2019. ==Education== He graduated from Bishop's University with a degree in economics. Smith was the first overall selection of the 1972 CFL Draft and went on to play nine seasons in the Canadian Football League, all of them as a running back with the Montreal Alouettes. Smith earned a Bachelor of Civil Law from McGill University in 1976, having undertaken his studies for law while playing pro football. ==Football management career== Smith became the Canadian Football League's eighth commissioner in 1992 and oversaw the league's ill-fated attempt to expand to the United States. Smith then oversaw the re-location of the Baltimore Stallions to Montreal, where they became the Montreal Alouettes for the CFL's 1996 season. After resigning as commissioner in 1997, Smith served as president of the Alouettes until 2001 and again from 2004 to 2010. ==Business career== He was president and publisher of the Montreal Gazette newspaper from 2002 to 2004. He has also held positions with Industrial Life Technical Services, John Labatt, Ltd., and Ogilvie Mills, Ltd. ==Political career== He considered running for leader of the then new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004 and was widely reported by Canadian press at the time to be on the verge of entering the race before finally announcing he would not be a candidate. On December 18, 2010, he was summoned to the Canadian Senate on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and sat as a Conservative. Following his appointment to the Senate, Smith announced his intention to seek the nomination to run as a Conservative candidate in Lac-Saint-Louis in the next federal election. When asked in a television interview why he accepted the appointment while intending to run for a Commons seat, Smith complained that he was taking a \"dramatic, catastrophic\" pay cut by serving as a senator, a remark for which Smith has been criticized. Smith was defeated in his attempt to enter Parliament, placing third behind the incumbent Liberal MP and the NDP candidate, and it was announced on May 18, 2011, he would be re-appointed to the Senate. The Conservative Senate Caucus elected Smith its leader on March 28, 2017; Smith defeated Senators Linda Frum and Stephen Greene for the position, and took office on April 1, 2017. ==Personal life== Smith has three children, two sons and a daughter. One of his sons, Bradley, is a former receiver for the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos, while his daughter, Ashley, was formerly married to CFL placekicker and punter Damon Duval. ==References== ==External links== *Official bio on Alouettes website *Parliamentary biography Category:1951 births Category:McGill University alumni Category:Canadian Football League commissioners Category:Canadian football running backs Category:Montreal Alouettes players Category:Montreal Alouettes team presidents Category:Grey Cup champions Category:Canadian sportsperson-politicians Category:Canadian sports businesspeople Category:Living people Category:People from Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Bishop's Gaiters football players Category:Businesspeople from Quebec Category:Conservative Party of Canada senators Category:Canadian senators from Quebec Category:Players of Canadian football from Quebec Category:Bishop's University alumni Category:Conservative Party of Canada candidates in the 2011 Canadian federal election Category:Quebec candidates for Member of Parliament Category:McGill University Faculty of Law alumni ",
