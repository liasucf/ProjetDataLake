    "text": "D/Generation is an action-adventure game with puzzle elements originally developed for the 8-bit Apple II during the late 80's, but instead published and released for MS-DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST by Mindscape in 1991. The game takes place in a slightly cyberpunk futuristic setting in 2021. It was ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1993, allowing use of the 6-button CD32 gamepad. A remake of the game with improved graphics called D/Generation HD was released for Microsoft Windows by West Coast Software on October 23, 2015 and for the Nintendo Switch on March 27, 2018 in North America. and in Europe on April 3, 2018. ==Plot== D/Generation's plot begins in Singapore on June 27, 2021. A French company called Genoq has developed a series of new genetically engineered bioweapons, which have run out of control and taken over Genoq's Singaporean lab. The main character is a courier making an emergency delivery by jetpack of an important package to one of Genoq's top researchers, Jean- Paul Derrida (a name likely inspired by the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida), and who is happily oblivious to the carnage until the lab's doors lock behind him. His customer is ten floors away, all of them crawling with bioweapons. ==Gameplay== The game presents an isometric point of view of different interconnected, mazelike rooms that the player passes through floor by floor. Each room can require brains, brawn or both. All bioweapons present in a room must be killed and all air duct vents that they enter through sealed before proceeding further. The building's paranoid security system has predictably gone haywire, leaving rotating grenade launcher turrets, land mines, electrified floors and laser fences targeting humans. Less hostile puzzle elements are doors, the switches and computers that control them, keycards, infrared electric eyes and teleporters. The courier is soon armed with a laser gun that holds unlimited ammunition and a great puzzle value: its shots bounce off walls, trip switches and travel in teleporters. Finally, surviving Genoq employees and some special items are scattered around the floors. Rescuing a survivor by clearing a room of bioweapons and getting him/her to its entry point in one piece earns an extra life. Bombs are the most prominent item; they can blast through doors and destroy some hazards, making them a kind of a \"get out of puzzle free\" coupon. The number of lives is limited. Losing one restarts the room if any are left, the floor if not. Saving is available, loading returns to the start of the floor. ==Development== D/Generation was originally developed for the 128K Apple IIe (utilizing Double-Hi-Res mode) under the name D-Generation. An early preliminary version for that platform exists and is dated 1989. According to the Prince of Persia journals by Jordan Mechner, the game was completed in 1990 but the MS-DOS version from 1991 appears to be the first public release. While the original Apple II version was fully playable and well polished, it was never publicly released. ==Reception== Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Amiga CD32 version a 7.25 out of 10. They criticized that the Amiga CD32 controller does not work well with the game's isometric perspective, but praised the combination of action and puzzles, describing the game as both addictive and challenging. The game was ranked the 40th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 In 1994, PC Gamer US named D/Generation the 32nd best computer game ever. The editors wrote that its \"clever mix of puzzle-solving and arcade action hooked nearly everyone who did get a chance to try it out.\" That same year, PC Gamer UK named it the 44th best computer game of all time, calling it the \"best game of its type on the PC.\" In 1998, PC Gamer US declared it the 38th-best computer game ever released, and the editors wrote that its \"gameplay is still as fresh and inviting as the day it was first released.\" == References == ==External links== * *Now available to play online at archive.org/details/msdos_D-Generation_1991 *Video of opening sequence, music, and gameplay on Youtube *Italian fan translation of the game at OldgamesItalia.net Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:Atari ST games Category:CD32 games Category:DOS games Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:Video games scored by Mark Knight Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Science fiction video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Video games set in 2021 Category:Single-player video games Category:Cyberpunk video games ",
