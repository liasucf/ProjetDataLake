It is in the complex of Sasana Budaya, the old palace of the Buleleng Kingdom. In its collection are lontar manuscripts (written on dried leaves of the rontal palm), prasasti (inscribed on copper plates) and manuscripts on paper in Balinese and Roman characters including documents from the colonial period (1901-1953). Ex Bupati of Buleleng Dr Ketut Wirata Sindhu is upgrading the library into a full museum. When completed, the museum will cover the entire Sasana Budaya complex. == References == * Bali, Lonely Planet(2003) Category:Libraries in Indonesia Category:Balinese culture Category:Buildings and structures in Bali Category:Organizations based in Bali ",
