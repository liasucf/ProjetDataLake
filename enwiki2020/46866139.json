Italian Michele Bartoli won the monument classic ahead of Fabio Baldato and Johan Museeuw. The race started in Sint-Niklaas and finished in Meerbeke (Ninove). ==Race summary== A group of 11, containing all favourites, was at the foot of the Muur van Geraardsbergen, when defending champion and race favourite Johan Museeuw had a lingering rear wheel and was distanced on the climb. Michele Bartoli attacked on the steep upper slopes of the Muur and pushed on over the Bosberg towards the finish. The stylish Italian won with a minute lead over the chase group where team mate Fabio Baldato won the sprint ahead of a returning Museeuw. ==Climbs== There were sixteen categorized climbs: {| width=65% | valign=top align=left width=33% | * Tiegemberg * Kluisberg * Knokteberg * Oude Kwaremont * Paterberg * Kortekeer | valign=top align=left width=34% | * Taaienberg * Eikenberg * Volkegemberg * Varent * Leberg * Molenberg | valign=top align=left width=33% | * Berendries * Valkenberg * Muur-Kapelmuur * Bosberg |} ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- |1 | | MG-Technogym | align=right| 6h 27' 00\" |- |2 | | MG-Technogym | align=right| + 55\" |- |3 | | Mapei-GB | align=right| s.t. |- |4 | | Rabobank | align=right| s.t. |- |5 | | MG-Technogym | align=right| s.t. |- |6 | | Lotto | align=right| s.t. |- |7 | | Festina-Lotus | align=right| s.t. |- |8 | | Roslotto-SG Mobili | align=right| s.t. |- |9 | | Rabobank | align=right| s.t. |- |10 | | TVM | align=right| s.t. |} ==External links== *Recap of the 1996 Tour of Flanders (Flemish television) ==References== Category:Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour Of Flanders Category:April 1996 sports events in Europe ",
