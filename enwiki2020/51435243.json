She submitted her PhD thesis, entitled Classifying Madness: A Philosophical Examination of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, to the University of Cambridge in January 2002. A book based on the PhD thesis, and of the same name, was published by Springer in 2005 as volume 86 of their Philosophy and Medicine series. By the time of the book's publication, Cooper had moved to Lancaster University.Cooper, Rachel (2005). Classifying Madness: A Philosophical Examination of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Dordrecht: Springer. pp. i\u2013vii. In Classifying Madness, Cooper offers an analysis of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), arguing that while the DSM goal of classifying mental disorders as natural kinds is a good one it is unlikely to be successful in real-world practice.Tsou, Jonathan Y.

The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 61 (2): 453\u20137. Double, Duncan (2006). \"Review \u2013 Classifying Madness\". Metapsychology Online Reviews 10 (1).
