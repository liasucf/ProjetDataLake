    "text": "\"With a Little Luck\" is a single by the band Wings from their 1978 album London Town. ==Writing, recording and release== \"With a Little Luck\" was written in Scotland and was Wings' follow-up single to the then best-selling UK Single of all time, \"Mull of Kintyre.\" It was recorded in May 1977 in the Virgin Islands aboard the boat Fair Carol, which had been fitted with a 24-track studio, for the album London Town. The album, which had the working title Water Wings was released in March 1978 as the band's seventh album. During these recordings, Wings' lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Joe English had recorded tracks but had left, returning the band to the three- piece line-up which had recorded Band on the Run in 1973. McCartney played electric piano, bass and synthesiser in the song; probably English was on drums, while Denny Laine and Linda McCartney helped with some keyboards.Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969-2013), L.I.L.Y. Publishing, 2013, , pp.157-8. \"With a Little Luck\" was released in March 1978 as the first single from the album and reached No. 1 in the United States and No. 5 in the UK. While it was at the top of the charts in the US, McCartney announced the new Wings line up featuring lead guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley. The single's b-side consists of the segue of two short tracks, \"Backward Traveller\"/\"Cuff Link\", also on the album, the first of which is a song and the second an instrumental that features a heavily synthesised guitar theme. Billboard Magazine described \"With a Little Luck\" as an \"optimistic and celebrative\" midtempo pop song that it expected to be one of McCartney's most commercially successful songs. Author Chris Ingham praised the song as one of the best on the album, stating it was \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches.\" Tom Waseleski of the Beaver County Times regarded \"With a Little Luck\" as having \"more substance\" than McCartney's other soft rock tracks. The song's music video, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, aired in the UK on 9 May 1978, as part of Granada Television's Paul TV show. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2014 vocals, bass guitar, synthesizer, keyboards *Linda McCartney \u2014 keyboards, backing vocals *Denny Laine \u2014 keyboards, backing vocals *Joe English \u2014 drums ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1978) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Austria | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |align=\"left\"|Australia KMR | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany | style=\"text-align:center;\"|17 |- |align=\"left\"|Ireland | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Norway | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |US Cash Box Top 100.
