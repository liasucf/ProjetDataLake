Over 2,000 decorated rock fragments extend to the foot of the mountain. These petroglyphs, some believed to date back to the Paleolithic (12,000 BCE), are carved onto dark brownish-black volcanic stones left behind by an extinct volcano. Later Chalcolithic and Bronze Age cultures continued to create petroglyphs at the site; \"the largest variety and number of carvings date to this period and the early Iron Age, before it was finally abandoned except for a few carvings made by lonely shepherds spending their summers on the mountain top.\"http://www.armenianheritage.org/en/monument/Ughtasar/120 Although the site was discovered in the early 20th century, it was not really studied until the 1920s and again in the late 1960s; it is still not fully understood today. The carvings on the rock fragments depict hunting scenes, a wide array of animals, spirals, circles and geometric shapes, and even zodiac signs. Research suggests that the area served as a temporary dwelling for nomadic cattle-herding tribes, and studies of the rock carvings indicate that they were in use for hundreds of years, with peoples of later eras adding their own engravings to the stones. According to the research of Hamlet Martirosyan, the pictograms of Ughtasar represent a writing system known as \"goat writing\" or \"itsagir\". Many scholars believe that this was due to the large number of goats drawn on the stones, but according to Martirosyan it is because in the ancient Armenian language, the words \u201cgoat\u201d and \u201cwriting\u201d were homonyms. They would use these homonyms to express concepts through pictures, thus the abstract concept of \u201cwriting\u201d (which in ancient Armenian can be expressed with words like \u201cshar\u201d \u2013 arrange, \u201csarel\u201d \u2013 compile, \u201ctsir\u201d \u2013 a line) found its reflection in the representation of a goat (\u201czar\u201d), because the words for \u201cwriting\u201d and \u201cgoat\u201d sounded the same. Goats are a prevalent theme on the stones, possibly because the word \u201cdig\u201d in ancient Armenian meant goat and was close enough to \u201cdiq,\u201d the ancient word for gods. By combining abstract signs with the images of animals and people in horizontal or vertical rows, prehistoric engravers were able to convey specific messages. Reproductions of the petroglyphs, or rock engravings, of Ughtasar can be found all over Yerevan; they are inscribed onto silver jewelry, painted onto coffee cups, traced into hand-made pottery, and they adorn the walls of cafes. Reaching the petroglyphs of Ughtasar can be challenging. ==See also== * Karahunj or Zorats Karer, a nearby prehistoric site also known as the \"Armenian Stonehenge\" * Armenian Gampr dog ==References== == External links == *Ughtasar: The Petroglyphs of Armenia *Ughtasar Petroglyphs - ArmeniaPedia.org Category:Archaeology of Armenia Category:Rock art in Europe Category:Petroglyphs ",
