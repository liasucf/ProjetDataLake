Incomplete, its style is very close to that of Effect of Snow on Petit- Montrouge and The Exposition Universelle of 1867 (Rouart, Widenstein 1975 no. 123). It is also known as Burial at the Glaci\u00e8re (Enterrement \u00e0 la Glaci\u00e8re), the title given to it in Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein's posthumous inventory of Manet's works. \u00c9douard Manet : catalogue raisonn\u00e9, tome I, peintures, Biblioth\u00e8que des arts, Lausanne, Paris, 1975, p.27. The work was sold by Suzanne Manet to the art dealer Portier in August 1894 for 300 francs. In 1902 it is recorded as owned by Camille Pissarro, who had known Manet well and frequented the Caf\u00e9 Guerbois. The painting was next acquired by Ambroise Vollard, who sold it to its present owner for $ 2319. ==Composition and dating== It shows a hearse and its attendants at the bottom of the quartier Mouffetard, heading for the Montparnasse Cemetery, with the Observatoire de Paris, \u00e9glise Notre-Dame du Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, the Panth\u00e9on, the bell tower of the \u00e9glise Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont and the tour Clovis (now the lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV) in the distance. Charles Sterling-Salinger notes that Manet has brought the domes of the Observatoire of the \u00e9glise Notre-Dame du Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce closer together to improve the composition.Impressionist and Post-impressionist Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 1967 . According to Adolphe Tabarant, the scene is set in the rue de l'Estrapade. Tabarant initially dated the work to 1870, but later amended this to the earlier date, which he felt more probable. Due to the presence of a horse grenadier of the Imperial Guard at the back of the procession, Henri Loyrette argues that the scene is set before the end of the French Second Empire. The work was most probably inspired by the funeral of the painter's friend Charles Baudelaire on 2 September 1867, at which Manet had assisted. The weather was stormy that day, the sky heavy and the cort\u00e8ge small because \u2013 according to Charles Asselineau \u2013 many people were absent from Paris and could not return in time. On their return, about a hundred people were in the church and at the Montparnasse Cemetery. ==References== == Bibliography == * Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S.
