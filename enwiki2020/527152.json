    "text": "This is a list of destroyer classes of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, organised chronologically by entry into service. == Torpedo boat destroyers == In 1913, the surviving members of the large heterogeneous array of older 27-knot and 30-knot torpedo boat destroyer types (all six of the original 26-knot ships had been disposed of by the end of 1912) were organised into the A, B, C and D classes according to their design speed and the number of funnels they possessed. All were of a \"turtle-back\" design and, excepting a few \"builder's specials\", powered by reciprocating engines. It should be stressed that these A to D class designations did not exist before 1913, and only applied to those \"turtle-backed\" destroyers surviving to that time. * \"26-knotter\" types ** Daring class: 2 ships, 1893-1894 ** Havock class: 2 ships, 1893 ** Ferret class: 2 ships, 1893-1894 * A class; (27-knot classes) ** Ardent class: 3 ships, 1894-1895 ** Charger class: 3 ships, 1894 ** Rocket class: 3 ships, 1894 ** Hardy class: 2 ships, 1895 ** Conflict class: 3 ships, 1894-1895 ** Fervent class: 2 ships, 1895 ** Janus class: 3 ships, 1895 ** Sturgeon class: 3 ships, 1894-1895 ** Salmon class: 2 ships, 1895 ** Swordfish class: 2 ships, 1895 ** Banshee class: 3 ships, 1894 ** Handy class: 3 ships, 1895 ** Sunfish class: 3 ships, 1895 ** Zebra class: 1 ship, 1895 * B class (4-funnelled, 30-knot classes) ** Quail class: 4 ships, 1895 ** Earnest class: 6 ships, 1896-1897 ** Spiteful class: 2 ships, 1899 ** Myrmidon class: 2 ships, 1900 * C class (3-funnelled, 30-knot classes) ** Star class: 6 ships, 1896-1897 ** Avon class: 3 ships, 1896-1897 ** Brazen class: 4 ships, 1896-1898 ** Violet class: 2 ships, 1897 ** Mermaid class: 2 ships, 1897-1898 ** Gipsy class: 3 ships, 1897 ** Bullfinch class: 3 ships, 1898 ** Fawn class: 6 ships, 1897-1899 ** Falcon class: 2 ships, 1899-1900 ** Greyhound class: 3 ships, 1900-1901 ** Thorn class: 3 ships, purchased 1901 ** Hawthorn special type: 2 ships, 1899, steam turbine specials ** Thornycroft special: 1 ship, 1898 ** Armstrong-Whitworth special,: 1 ship, 1900 * D class; (2-funnelled, 30-knot classes) Unlike the A, B and C classes, the D class comprised a series of similar ships built by one contractor (Thornycroft), although there were small variations between the batches ordered in each year. ** 1893-94 Programme: 4 ships, 1896 ** 1894-95 Programme: 2 ships, 1897 ** 1895-96 Programme: 3 ships, 1897-1898 ** 1896-97 Programme (special type): 1 ship, 1899 * Taku type: 1 ship, 1900, ex-Chinese prize ==Conventional destroyers== In 1913, lettered names were given to all Royal Navy destroyers, previously known after the first ship of that class.
