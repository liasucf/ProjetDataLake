At the IOC session in Copenhagen in October 2009, the IOC decided to reinstate this event for the 2016 Summer Olympics. As of the 2016 Olympics, qualification is based primarily upon the Official World Golf Ranking (Men) and Women's World Golf Rankings, with the top fifteen of each gender automatically qualifying (with a limit of four per country), and then the highest ranked players from countries that had not yet already qualified two players. ==Medal table== ===Total=== ===Men=== ===Women=== ==Events== ;1900 *Men's individual *Women's individual ;1904 *Men's individual *Men's team ;2016 *Men's individual *Women's individual ;2020 *Men's individual *Women's individual A men's individual tournament was planned for the 1908 London Games, but an internal dispute amongst British golfers led to them boycotting the event, leaving 1904 gold medallist George Lyon as the only competitor.
