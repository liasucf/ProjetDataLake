    "text": "The Nashville Student Movement was an organization that challenged racial segregation in Nashville, Tennessee during the Civil Rights Movement. It was created during workshops in nonviolence taught by James Lawson. The students from this organization initiated the Nashville sit-ins in 1960. They were regarded as the most disciplined and effective of the student movement participants during 1960. The Nashville Student Movement was key in establishing leadership in the Freedom Riders. Members of the Nashville Student Movement, who would go on to lead much of the activities and strategies of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, included Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, James Bevel, John Lewis, C. T. Vivian, and others. Protesters intentionally dressed 'sharp' during protests in anticipation of their arrests. == Response == The Nashville Student Movement received praise from Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. == Legacy == The Children, a 1999 book by David Halberstam, chronicles the participants and actions of the Nashville students. The establishment of the Nashville Student Movement was covered in the graphic novel March: Book One, as well as the animated series adaptation. A marker called the \"Nashville Student Movement Office\" was placed at 21st Avenue North and Jefferson Street to commemorate the civil rights protests in Nashville. Tourism officials in Nashville and Tennessee overall have made efforts to make the civil rights movement in Nashville as a historical tourist attraction. Efforts began in January 2018, and six Nashville locations were made a part of the U.S. Civil Rights Trail across various Southern states, a collection of different Civil Rights locations. ==See also== *Rodney N.
