    "text": "The 2003 SCCA ProRally Season was the 31st season of the SCCA ProRally and won by Manxman David Higgins and co-driver Daniel Barritt.http://www.ewrc- results.com/season.php?s=2003&nat;=34 Nine rounds were held but the season was overshadowed by a tragic accident at the Oregon Trail Rally in which the 2001 champion Mark Lovell and his co-driver Roger Freeman were killed. They were the second and third drives to die in the series, after Jonel Broscanc, who was killed in an accident at the 1992 Susquehannock Trail Performance Rally. None the less, the title was won by Higgins who beat Americans Lauchlin O'Sullivan and Ramana Lagemann to defend his title from 2002. Higgins is now known for winning five straight titles in SCCA ProRally's successor Rally America. The manufacturer's title went to Mitsubishi. ==Teams and Drivers== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
