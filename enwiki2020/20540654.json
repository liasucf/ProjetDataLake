Akpa Akpro came through the youth ranks at Toulouse FC where he picked up Ligue 1 experience, before moving to Belgian side FC Brussels. He subsequently moved to England, playing for Grimsby Town, Rochdale, Bury, Tranmere Rovers, Shrewsbury Town and Barnet. He was previously called up to play international football for France at U18 level but injury forced him to withdraw from the squad. ==Career== ===Toulouse=== Akpa Akpro was born in Toulouse,football.co.uk profile France. He started his career at his home town club, French First Division side Toulouse as a youngster in 2003. While at with the club, he spent time on loan with Stade Brestois 29 in the French Second Division where he scored twice in 15 appearances. He featured in around 40 games for Toulouse from between 2003 and 2007, managing to score a total of three goals. While with Toulouse, Akpa Akpro was briefly called up to the France U18 International team, but was forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury. He was never selected again. ===FCM Brussels=== Akpa Akpro was released by Toulouse at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. He then left France and headed north where he signed for Belgian side FC Brussels in the summer of 2007. He remained with the club for the 2007\u201308 season, playing only a cameo role in the club's season by making only three appearances for the club. Akpro was released at the end of the season. After his departure from Brussels, Akpa Akpro had travelled to England where he joined Milton Keynes Dons in a pre- season trial, before also spending a week training with Colchester United. However both trials didn't pay off and Akpro began the 2008\u201309 season as a free agent. ===Grimsby Town=== On 2 December 2008, Akpa Akpro joined English club Grimsby Town on trial with a view of earning a permanent contract. A day later he received international clearance to play for Grimsby's reserve team in their league fixture away against Bradford City. He played the entire 90 minutes in a 2\u20131 win for Grimsby. Two days later, on 4 December 2008 he was offered and subsequently signed an 18-month contract keeping him at Blundell Park until the end of the 2009\u201310 season. The signing of Akpro at Grimsby would be the third French speaking player to join the club under in the Mike Newell tenure, with Congolese midfielder Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala and fellow Frenchman Mickael Buscher also arriving at Cleethorpes. He originally was set to make his debut against Port Vale on 6 December, but his papers from the Belgian Football Association were not received on time for him to feature. He instead made his debut against Shrewsbury Town on 13 December, and helped Grimsby to record their first home league victory of the season with a 1\u20130 victory. He went on to make it into the League Two Team of the Week after setting up Nathan Jarman's winner against Wycombe Wanderers on 17 January 2009. In the remaining months of the season, The Mariners were involved in a relegation battle, in which Akpa Akpro found himself playing a key part, mainly being fielded in attack alongside Adam Proudlock. In March 2009, Akpro and Proudlock destroyed local rivals Lincoln City in a 5\u20131 victory, with Akpa Akpro scoring two, and Proudlock hitting a hat-trick. Towards the very end of the campaign Barry Conlon became Akpro's regular strike partner, and the two would turn out to become vital to the club's eventual survival from relegation. During the 2009\u201310 season, a managerial change saw the man responsible for his arrival at Grimsby, Mike Newell sacked in October 2009. During the season in which many different players were used all over the pitch, Akpro's role in the first team would change from week to week, with some weeks new boss Neil Woods choosing to play him in his usual attacking role, whilst other weeks he operated in a wide left position or on the wing, and in other weeks merely only a substitute and in some circumstances also failing to make the 18 man squad at all. Akpro would play his part in ending an awful club record when he scored in a 3\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town on 6 March 2010, which was Grimsby's first league victory in 25 games. Following relegation from the Football League, Akpro rejected Grimsby's new contract offer and left the club on 26 June 2010.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2079073,00.html ===Rochdale=== On 7 July he signed a two-year deal with League One newcomers Rochdale, after he turned down a new contract at Grimsby.http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12875_6250128,00.html He made his Rochdale debut in a friendly match against Fleetwood Town in which he scored from 20 yards out in a 3\u20130 victory. In his first season with Dale, the club earned a very respectable 9th place in Football League One, and were unlucky to miss out on capturing a play-off place. During the 2011\u201312 campaign Akpro and Rochdale were relegated. ===Tranmere Rovers=== On 19 June 2012 he signed a two-year deal with Tranmere Rovers, after he turned down a new contract from Rochdale.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18507084 He scored a brace on his debut against Leyton Orient on 18 August 2012, this prompted his manager Ronnie Moore to comment saying Jean-Louis is capable of playing in the Premier League and that he fully expected him to score 20 goals throughout the coming season.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19318482 After topping the scoring charts of League 1 with 7 goals in 10 games, it was announced Akpa Akpro would be out for 3 months with a fractured metatarsal, coming off in the 18th minute in a 1\u20130 victory away at Notts County.

On 29 November, he scored a late winner against Burton Albion for Shrewsbury's 12th victory in 14 home games, as well as handing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink his first defeat as Burton manager.

With the club close to the Financial Fair Play limit and unable to move on fringe players, chairman Roland Wycherley agreed to fund a one-year contract extension, which was signed in time for the player to be available for selection for the opening league match of the following season against Millwall. He scored his first goals of the season \u2013 a brace in a 2\u20130 win against Blackpool \u2013 to secure a first home victory of the campaign on 26 September.
