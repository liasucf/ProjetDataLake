    "text": "The Brisbane Valley Highway is a state highway in Queensland. It links the Warrego Highway near Ipswich and the D'Aguilar Highway about north of Harlin. Its direction follows the approximate course of the Brisbane River. It is part of State Route A17, duplexing with the D'Aguilar Highway to Nanango and then becomes the Burnett Highway. State Route 85 is duplexed with the Brisbane Valley Highway from Esk to the D'Aguilar Highway. The highway crosses the Wivenhoe Dam about north-west of Fernvale. In the near future, the intersection with the Warrego Highway will be converted into a grade-separated interchange. ==List of towns along the Brisbane Valley Highway== * Ipswich * Fernvale * Esk * Toogoolawah ==Major intersections== ==Gallery== File:Brisbane Valley Highway Wanora.jpg|Brisbane Valley Highway at Wanora, 2014 ==See also== * Bridges over the Brisbane River * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Queensland * List of highways numbered 85 ==References== ==External links== Category:Highways in Queensland Category:South East Queensland ",
