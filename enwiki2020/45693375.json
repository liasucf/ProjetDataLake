    "text": "The Stolen Kiss is a painting by French painter Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732\u20131806) from the end of the 1780s, depicting a secretive romance. The painting is hosted in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The style of the painting was characteristic of the French Rococo period and was favoured by the wealthy art patrons of his time. == History == The Stolen Kiss, by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois Regnault after Fragonard (ca. 1788) The earliest known evidence of The Stolen Kiss comes from the June 1788 issue of the Mercure de France magazine, where an engraving by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois Regnault of Fragonard's painting has been advertised as a pendant to The Bolt. Shortly later in the 1790s, the work was purchased by Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, the last sovereign of the first Rzechpospolita; it was present in the catalogue of the Royal Picture Gallery at the Lazienki Palace in Warsaw in 1795. Perhaps it was bought at one of the auctions, which sold goods of the French aristocracy following the Revolution of 1789. This would explain the silence of the sources about the acquisition of the work and its certain formal and thematic incompatibility with the other works of the collection. Poniatowski highly valued The Stolen Kiss, and was willing to have it taken from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg upon his abdication in 1795; the shipment did not take place, though, and the painting remained in the Lazienki Palace until 1895, when it was acquired by Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and was taken to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg together with four other paintings from Stanis\u0142aw August's collection. After regaining independence in 1918 first, and later after the end of World War II in 1945, the Polish government made diplomatic efforts to recover the painting. In the light of international law and arrangements with the authorities of the Soviet Union, the painting as work of art of national importance taken by Russians from Poland in the 19th century, or during World War II, was a subject to legal restitution. However, the Soviet authorities refused to release the painting, retaining it in the Hermitage collection, and arbitrarily compensated it (among with several others valuable paintings) with several works of lesser value. In 1922, The Stolen Kiss was specifically compensated with the smaller La femme polonaise, a painting of the 1720s formerly attributed to Jean-Antoine Watteau, from the Hermitage collection (originally purchased in 1772 from Louis Antoine Crozat's collection by Tsarina Catherine the Great of Russia, now in possession of the National Museum in Warsaw). ==Painting== The painting depicts a kiss between two lovers, showing a young lady in cream-coloured silk gown who appears to have left her company for a secret meeting with a young man. The composition is diagonal, made up by an axis composed through her leaning figure, the shawl and the balcony door opening from the outside, ending with the table the shawl is draped over. The painting offers an array of compositional contrasts between colours and shadows: the spatial intersections are complex. Jean- Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's works display the kind of eroticism and voluptuousness and the liking for romantic folly that was popular before the French Revolution among French aristocrats. Fragonard includes scenes of voyeurism in his paintings. This scene is depicting the stolen kiss in lavish surroundings, containing luxurious details of textures, silks and lace, like the rug with flower pattern, silk draperies, her shawl on the chair, the elegantly clad ladies that are visible through the open door. The dominant French culture influenced how Fragonard chose his themes, that were mostly erotic or love scenes, painted for Louis XV's pleasure-loving court's enjoyment. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * Category:1786 paintings Category:Kissing Category:Paintings by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard Category:Paintings of the Hermitage Museum ",
