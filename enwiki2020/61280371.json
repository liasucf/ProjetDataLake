    "text": "Tabita Rezaire (born 1989, France) is a contemporary artist, \"health-tech- political\" therapist, and \"kemetic\" and kundalini yoga teacher. == Biography == Rezaire defines as \"Franco-Guyano-Danish\". She grew up in Paris and studied there, as well as in Copenhagen and London, where she did a master's degree at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. She then lived in Paris, Mozambique and Johannesburg from 2014. In 2017, she was welcomed in residence by MeetFactory in Prague, where she began working on sound. == Style == She produces videos and digital works where she frequently stages herself. The body is considered a technology in her work. Many of her works deal with the concept of race and feminism. Her video work Afro Cyber Resistance (2014) denounces the Western-centric nature of the Internet, and the form of white supremacism that is exercised through network control. It describes the Internet, like the world around it, as \"exploitative, discriminatory, classist, patriarchal, racist, homophobic, coercive and manipulative\". It calls for cyber-resistance that would lead to the decolonisation of the Internet. Her first solo exhibition, Exotic Trade, was held in 2017 at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg. It includes videos, an installation, and digitally produced self-portraits. Her work has been exhibited extensively including at Arebyte Gallery, London, 2019; Athens Bienniale, 2018; Auto Italia, London; MAXXI, Rome; Artspace, Sydney. == Collaborations == She works with Alicia Mersy in the artists duo Malaxa, based in Johannesburg and Tel Aviv. She is also a founding member of SENEB as well as the Johannesburg-based collective NTU, with Bogosi Sekhukhuni and Nolan Oswald Dennis. == Notes and references == === References === == Links == === External links === * Artists website https://tabitarezaire.com/ *Artist profile on Rhizome https://rhizome.org/editorial/2018/feb/01/artist-profile-tabita-rezaire/ *NTU Exhibition Review https://www.aqnb.com/2017/06/20/fighting-for-the-future- with-the-digital-healing-survivalism-of-ntu-collectives-ubulawu-at-londons- auto-italia/ *Interview on Studio International https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/tabita-rezaire-interview === Internal Links === * Cyberfeminism * Afrofeminism * Feminist Art * Afrofuturism Category:Digital artists Category:French contemporary artists Category:1989 births Category:Living people ",
