    "text": "The Church of St Michael and All Angels, Orton Road, Lawton Moor, Northenden, Manchester, is an Anglican church of 1935-7 by N.F.Cachemaille-Day.Hartwell et al. 2004, p 493-4 Pevsner describes the church as \"sensational for its country and its time\". The church has been listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England since 16 January 1981. The Corporation of Manchester acquired the Wythenshawe Estate in 1926 and began laying out the garden suburb in 1930. Covering , it was eventually to have 25,000 houses and a population of 100,000. The garden suburb was designated part of the parish of Church of St Wilfrid, Northenden but that small parish church proved insufficient to accommodate the rising congregation. A mission church was therefore opened in 1934, and in 1935 the diocese approved plans for the construction of a new parish church at Orton Road. The budget was \u00a310,000. Nugent Francis Cachemaille-Day was appointed as architect for both the church and the adjoining parsonage. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 8 May 1937, by the Bishop of Manchester. The builder was J. Clayton and Sons of Denton. The plan of the church is a star, comprising two inter-locked squares. It is built of \"red brick in English bond with some stone dressings\". The roof is flat with a cross in the centre. The interior is \"raw but spatially subtle\". It has an \"ingenious plan with lofty columns supporting [a] flat ribbed roof\". The plans show the long-held tradition that Cachemaille-Day intended to place the altar in the centre of the building is not correct. Michael Barber, FRS (1934 \u2013 1991) was a chemist and mass spectrometrist who became the church organist. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester *Listed buildings in Manchester-M23 ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * Category:20th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Church of England church buildings in Greater Manchester Category:Churches completed in 1937 Category:Grade II* listed churches in Manchester Category:Nugent Cachemaille-Day buildings ",
