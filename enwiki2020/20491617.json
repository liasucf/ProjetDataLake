It is mentioned in Pausanias, who visited and described its temples, and who narrated the elaborate story of King Teuthis' dispute with Agamemnon and goddess Athena in Aulis, prior to the Greek fleet's departure for the Trojan War.The story goes as follows[Pausanias, Book VIII, 28 (4-6)] : During the Trojan war, the local Arcadians sent troops to Avlida to join the rest of the Greeks. Their leader, named Teuthis (or Ornytus, according to others), frustrated by the long waiting for favorable winds that would enable departure from Avlis, quarrelled with the commander- in-chief Agamemnon and was about to return his detachment of \"Teuthides\" back home. At this point, they say, Athene disguised as Melas, son of Ops, tried to block his return, but the furious Teuthis struck the thigh of the goddess with his spear and actually lead his men back to Arcadia. Upon his return to the homeland, they say Athene herself appeared to him in a vision having a wound in her thigh, and from then on a disease befell the city making it the only Arcadian district to produce no crops! Some time later, the people received instructions from the Dodona oracle on ceremonies meant to pacify the goddess, and they made s statue of Athene with a wound in her thigh. (Pausanias writes that he saw this statue, which had a purple bandage wrapped around the thigh.) == Introduction == According to Pausanias, Teuthis together with TheisoaTheisoa must not be confused with a city with the same name, located in the southwest, west of the river Alpheios in the Andritsaina area. and Methydrium, were three cities who originally \"belonged\" to Orchomenus but whose inhabitants decided to relocate and join many others in forming the Great City (Megalopolis), in 371 BCE in order to better protect themselves from the Spartans. Although labeled by some as a \"Homeric\" city, Teuthis is not explicitly mentioned in Homer. Thus the oldest and, practically, the only \"original\" information we have about its location can be found in Pausanias. Unfortunately, his description of the whereabouts of Teuthis is open to interpretation and, therefore, has caused a great deal of disagreement among the 19th century knowledgeable western travelers of Arcadia. == The Problem of Location == The following tabulation lists the names of the most important of such \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\", almost all of which used Pausanias' book as a guide in their Arcadian travels. With regard to Teuthis, their (independent) educated guesses involve two locations: the Akova/Galatas area in the north (the medieval castle of which is situated in a place inhabited in antiquity and whose habitation has had to be continuous),Antoine Bon, \"La Mor\u00e9e franque.

SmithWilliam Smith, Edit.,\"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography\", London 1854; on-line at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DT%3Aentry+group%3D6%3Aentry%3Dteuthis- geo quoted Ross, C. BursianConrad Bursian, \"Geographie von Griechenland\", zweiter Band: Peloponnesos und Inseln, Leipzig, Teubner 1868, p. 232 \"thanked\" Leake, and W. Hughes' mapWilliam Hughes, Map of the Peloponnese Peninsula, eng. G.E. Sherman, print. J. Bien, New York N.Y. 1867 also reflects Leake's ideas on the subject. Having practiced - at best - \"surface archaeology\", most of the distinguished travelers listed above were (understandably) careful when they wrote about the location of the city. They used words like \"probably\", \"perhaps\", \"may\", or the question mark next to its name (Teuthis?). Only Ross, Leake, and Levi took a definite stand on the issue (along with the \"cartographers\" Peytier, Kiessling, and Kiepert). Finally, Latterman was also firm about his choice, but he erroneously used Leake's name in the process. == A closer look at Pausanias' visit to Teuthis == Travelling on the road which joins Heraia with Megalopolis, Pausanias reached the village of Gortys, which used to be a city, and described the temple of Asclepius [Bk VIII, 28 (1)]. He then wrote about the river of the city, which has very cold water, especially in the summer. He explained that the southern part of it - which flows into the Alpheios - was called Gortynios, while the northern part was called Lousios (i.e. Wash, because new-born Zeus was bathed in it) [Bk VIII, 28 (2)]. The end of the next paragraph in Pausanias's \"Arcadika\" [Bk VIII, 28 (3)], contains the first significant information about the location problem: \" \u1f1c\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03b4\u1f74 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u1fb3 \u03c4\u1fc6 \u039c\u03b5\u03b8\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u1ff3\" \"But its springs are in Theisoa, which borders on the Methydrienses\" In other words, the Theisoa greater area, which borders the west part of Methydrio, extends all the way north-east of modern Langadia, where the actual springs of Gortynios/Lusios are found. Any map of the area shows that Theisoa - which is near the modern village of Karkalou - is located quite north of Gortys. Thus, it can be safely assumed that Pausanias was moving in a south-to-north direction, having started from Gortys and going toward Teuthis, since [Bk VIII, 28 (4)]: \"\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u1fb3 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u0398\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u1fb3 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u1f74\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b8\u03af\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9: \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f26\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f21 \u03a4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b8\u03b9\u03c2.\" \"Bordering town to Theisoa is Teuthis, which was formerly a city.\" That is, Teuthis, which is bordering Theisoa, was located somewhere north of Gortys. Pausanias, however, mentions Theisoa first, but does not indicate whether he visited there. And this, gets things complicated. Given the terrain of the greater area and the fact that Methydrium is the eastern neighbor of Theisoa, then Teuthis itself could be either the southern or the north-western neighbor. Thus, (keeping in mind that Pausanias is coming from the south) one must decide for which one of the two situations the phrase \"Teuthis borders Theisoa\" makes more sense. [Normally we are interested in what lies ahead of our destination, and not beyond it. Therefore, the preceding \"bordering\" statement could suggest that Teuthis lies beyond Theisoa, i.e. in its north- northwest.] == Conclusion == It is obvious that only systematic excavations can put an end to the doubts raised by the fact that no inscription naming Teuthis has been found in Dimitsana, the modern town which has \"claimed\" the name of the ancient city for its own ruins. As for contemporary arguments in support of such a claim, one can judge for himself reading the following opinions of esteemed personnel of the British and French \"archaeology\" schools in Athens, respectively: \u00b7 \"Dhimitsana. (...). The site is generally identified with ancient TeuthisR.
