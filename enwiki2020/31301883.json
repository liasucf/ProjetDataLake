    "text": "The men's light heavyweight (81 kg/178.2 lbs) Full-Contact category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Coimbra was the fourth heaviest of the male Full-Contact tournaments involving seventeen fighters from three continents (Europe, Asia and North America). Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Full-Contact rules. As there were far too few fighters for a tournament designed for thirty-two, fourteen of the men received a bye through to the second round. The tournament champion was Nikita Kuzmin from Russia who defeated Ehram Majidov from Azerbaijan by unanimous decision in the final to win gold. Defeated semi finalists D\u00e9nes R\u00e1cz from Hungary and Micky Marshall from Canada won bronze medals. ==Results== ===Key=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Abbreviation !
