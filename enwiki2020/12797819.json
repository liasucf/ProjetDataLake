Auchinstarry Basin is on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and a \u00a31.2M regeneration project has created a mooring basin for boats with 56 pontoon berths, a hard standing area for 40 boats, and a customer facilities block, partly funded by British Waterways Scotland. The basin was officially opened in September 2005. The Environment Advisory Service (EAS), a government agency, has implemented a number of sustainability features at Auchinstarry Basin: *Deploying recycled materials in all parts of the construction process *An innovative pump which draws heat from the canal; it is believed that this is the first such use of canal water in the UK *Plans for installing wind turbines, and a new pub which is self-sufficient in its energy needs ==See also== *List of places in North Lanarkshire ==References== *Environment Advisory Service case Study on Auchinstarry Basin It is also home to Auchinstarry Quarry which is a very popular rock-climbing destination, boasting a very wide range of climbing. ==External links== *Video footage of Auchinstarry Marina Category:Villages in North Lanarkshire ",
