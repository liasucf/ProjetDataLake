    "text": "The Golddiggers was a female singing and dancing troupe that performed in the style of Las Vegas showgirls. The group was formed in 1968, dissolved in 1992, and reorganized in 2007, and has numbered between four and 13 members over various time periods. The act debuted on The Dean Martin Show, and was later featured in a summer replacement television series over three seasons. In addition to backing Martin on his show and in his nightclub act, the group performed on their own on other TV programs, in live venues, and in three of Bob Hope's Christmas tours. Several members of the original (1968\u201373) troupe continue to perform as \"The Golddiggers\", while other former group members perform in other acts, in groups or as solo artists. ==History== The original idea to form a group of singer-dancers that would be called The Golddiggers grew out of a need to find a vehicle that would hold the attention of audiences during the summer months when The Dean Martin Showwhich began airing as a weekly series on NBC Television in September 1965would complete its regular season run and go on hiatus (as was standard practice with virtually all variety series during that era).Hale, Lee; Neely, Richard D. (2001). Backstage at the Dean Martin Show. Thorndike Press. . It was Dean Martin Show producer-director Greg Garrison who hatched the notion of a series with a nostalgic 1930s motif, and Dean Martin Show Music Director Lee Hale who, inspired by the chorines known as \"The Gold Diggers\" featured in the Busby Berkley - Warner Bros. films of the 1930s and '40s, thought of the name The Golddiggers to dub the ensemble of attractive and talented women around which this new show would revolve. The initial group, which numbered 12 performers, was introduced on The Dean Martin Show in Spring 1968 On June 20, 1968, they debuted in their own weekly summer variety series, Dean Martin Presents The Golddiggers. The program was the top-rated series of the 1968 summer season, and returned the following July (1969)with a somewhat altered lineup of performersonce again serving as the summer replacement series in Dean Martin's Thursday night time slot. For the series' third summer outing (which launched in July 1970) it shifted locales to London, with the title modified to become Dean Martin Presents The Golddiggers In London. In addition to airing for an hour each week on NBC in the U.S., this edition of The Golddiggers' series was also seen in half-hour weekly form in England. In between their summer series, The Golddiggers made occasional appearances on The Dean Martin Show and other programs, and joined Bob Hope in 1968, 1969, and 1970 on his annual USO- sponsored Christmas tours of U.S. military bases around the globe. Highlights of these trips were broadcast annually as specials on NBC, and drew some of the highest ratings of any programs during the years that they were telecast. Charles Nelson Reilly flanked by two dancers in the season premiere of NBC's The Golddiggers (1970) In the fall of 1970, The Golddiggers returned to the U.S. and became a regular part of the cast of The Dean Martin Show. That same season, four of the members of The Golddiggers (Michelle DellaFave, Tara Leigh, Susan Lund and Wanda Bailey) were selected by Greg Garrison and Lee Hale to form a smaller quartet called 'The Dingaling Sisters', which appeared from time to time in their own solo performances on Martin's show. In fall 1971, The Golddiggers group was spun off from The Dean Martin Show to headline their own weekly half-hour syndicated series entitled Chevrolet Presents The Golddiggers. At the same time, a revamped version of The Dingaling Sisters (comprising Michelle DellaFave, Tara Leigh, Taffy Jones, and Lynne Latham) succeeded The Golddiggers as the regular female singer/dancers on The Dean Martin Show. Two of the performers joining The Dingaling Sisters during the 1972-73 seasons who would later go on to greater renown were Lindsay Bloom (who appeared in many feature films and co-starred in the 1980s in the weekly CBS series Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer); and Jayne Kennedy (who would become well-known to American television audiences in the late 1970s and early '80s as a co-host of The NFL Today on CBS). The Golddiggers' syndicated series, which debuted in 1971, aired for two seasons until the early spring of 1973. The Golddiggers recorded three albums, the first in early 1969, when Metromedia Records released \u201cThe Golddiggers\u201d (MD1009), and within only a few months, released a second album, \u201cThe Golddiggers, We Need a Little Christmas\u201d (MD 1012). In 1971, RCA Corporation released their third album, \u201cThe Golddiggers\u2026 Today\u201d (LSP-4643). \"It got to the point where it got too expensive to have so many girls... they weren't being treated very fairly... It was getting really bad for the girls so they all got together and said, 'We're not going to do this anymore' and they all quit\". - Neil Daniels, former NBC VP and founder Dean Martin Fan Center.\"Beyond Our Wildest Dreams\" page=68, , Publisher=TvParty Books, Author=Maria Lauren, Author=Linda Eichberg, year=2011 \"That was the end of the line for us\". -Susan Lund, original Golddigger.\"Fanfare\" magazine number two, year=1978, page=20 by William Munger In 1973, a new group was chosen: Alberici Sisters - Maria Lauren (aka: Maria Elena Alberici) and Linda Eichberg (aka: Linda Alberici), Patti Gribow (aka: Patti Pivarnik), Deborah Pratt, Susan Buckner, Robin Hoctor, Lee Nolting and Colleen Kincaid. \"To the winners Garrison was all smiles and congratulations.\"Los Angeles Times, May 8, 1973 by Mark jones The Golddiggers, from 1973 through the 1990s continued The Golddigger legacy by being regulars on Dean Martin's TV Series and TV Specials. The biggest country music artists would join Martin and The Golddiggers on the Dean Martin Comedy Hour with a medley of hits: Lynn Anderson, Conway Twitty, Ray Stevens, Buck Owens, Loretta Lynn, Mac Davis, Mel Tillis, as well as entertainers Dionne Warwick, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and the top comedians for the Roasts segment. The Golddiggers also took their talent on the road, opening the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel and Casino performing in the \"Celebrity Room\" to sold out crowds with Dean Martin to over 2,000,000 people.Vegas Visitor newspaper, February 4, 1976 and March 9, 1977 They were the opening act for Petula Clark, Steve and Eydie, Joan Rivers at Caesars Palace and Bally's Las Vegas, and toured with Bob Hope, Louis Prima, Jerry Vale and many more entertainers. In 1977, The Golddiggers of the Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin tour were Maria Lauren (aka: Maria Elena Alberici - Riccio) and her sister, Linda (Alberici) - Eichberg, Patti Gribow, Peggy Gohl, Joyce Garro and Robyn Whatley. 1978 brought in a new look to the Golddiggers with new members Linda Snook, Marie Halton, Melody Ruhe and Julia Hanibal joining remaining members, Robyn Whatley and Peggy Gohl. In the tradition of the previous members, this group toured with Dean and performed in their own show sharing the stage with some of the entertainment world's greatest performers. For the next thirteen years, some of these women, and former members returned to the group and continued to represent the Golddiggers with all the glamour and talent they were known for. The Golddiggers continued on a grand form with another Mexico tour and also as Dean's opening act in Vegas. The group was booked for television and more Christmas in California specials... Before long we rejoined The Golddiggers. Working with Dean was a safe haven for us and we continued to perform with him until he retired in 1991.\"\"Beyond Our Wildest Dreams\" page=325, page=326, Author=Maria Lauren, Author=Linda Eichberg, Publisher=TvParty, , year=2011 All of the Golddiggers musical performances were under the direction of Lee Hale - who later wrote Backstage at the Dean Martin Show. \"Although the group started as an even dozen, they ended up as a quartet opening for Dean at his monthly dates in Las Vegas. Those last four girls were definitely among the best\". Maria (Alberici) Lauren, Linda (Alberici) Eichberg, Patti Gribow, Peggy Gohl, Marie Halton, Robyn Whatley, and Linda (Snook) Bott, were a part of that last group. With the approval of producers, Greg Garrison and Lee Hale, some of the remaining women performed as The Golddiggers within the span of over three decades and still perform as The former Dean Martin Golddiggers in \"SHOWSTOPPERS\" a tribute to the many stars that they had the honor to co-star and rub elbows with including the Rat Pack. Six of the original Dean Martin Golddiggers (Sheila Allan, Suzy Cadham, Jackie Chidsey, Susie Ewing, Rosie Gitlin, and Nancy Sinclair) have reunited and have been performing their hits on television and in Las Vegas. At a special Washington DC performance in November 2007, the six original Golddiggers were joined by two additional Golddiggers, Michelle DellaFave and Wanda Bailey.
