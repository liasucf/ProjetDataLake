    "text": "The Truce of Ulm () (also known as the Treaty of Ulm) was signed in Ulm on 14 March 1647 between France, Sweden, and Bavaria. This truce was developed after France and Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War. Both invading nations forced Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, to conclude the truce and renounce his alliance with Emperor Ferdinand III. However, Maximilian broke the truce and returned to his alliance with Ferdinand in the autumn of 1647. ==References== ==External links== * * Ulm Ulm Category:1647 in France Category:Ulm Ulm Category:1647 treaties Category:Treaties of the Swedish Empire Ulm Category:Treaties of the Electorate of Bavaria Category:1647 in Europe Category:1647 in Sweden Category:17th-century military history of France ",
