    "text": "Sverre Jordan (25 May 1889, in Bergen, Norway \u2013 10 January 1972, in Bergen) was a Norwegian composer, orchestra conductor, and pianist. == Biography == Jordan was born into the family of insurance agent Kaspar Joachim Jordan (1859\u20131924) and Anne Marie Margrethe Kj\u00e6rbye (1866\u20131935) from Denmark. From 1918 to 1949 he was married to the actress Magda Blanc, then in 1949 to actress Nina Sandvik Kristensen (29 March 1920 \u2013 30 October 1996). The family had a significant musical background, and there is a painting with Grandpa Caspar Jordan at the spinet. An aunt of his was a well known pianist in Denmark, but Jordan was not destined to become \"the musician\" of the family. After middle school graduation at Bergen katedralskole his father wanted him to attend the new trade school in Bergen. Then he worked for some years for the oil company Vestlandske Petroleumskompagni, before his father recognised that music would determine his son's further life. In 1959 he was made a Knight of the 1st order in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. == Music == In 1906 he made his first composition Nat. He went to Berlin and studied under Teresa Carre\u00f1o and Conrad Ansorge from 1907 to 1914, and studied composition with Wilhelm Klatte. His piano debut took place in Bergen, 1911. He studied piano with Nina Hagerup (Mrs Grieg), and went on a successful world tour for eight years. He performed as an accompanist with Kirsten Flagstad and Marian Anderson. In 1932, he became musical director of Den Nationale Scene, the theatre in Bergen. He led opera performances and pieces for theatre. In addition, he was conductor of Harmonien, the predecessor of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra and its associated choir. Here he gave about a hundred concerts. In the meantime, he taught and wrote articles as musical reviewer for Morgenavisen in Bergen. For 50 years (1916\u201366), he was chairman of the Philharmonic's Music Board of Directors, for several years the Chairman of the program Committee. From the start, he was also in the program Committee and advised for the Bergen International Festival. He was an honorary member of the Bergen Filharmoniske Orkester, and was awarded the gold medal chain in 1966. In the Grieghallen, there is furnished an honorary place for Sverre Jordan. == Works == His body of work consists of approximately 200 opus numbered works divided into over 85 opuses. He further expanded on the Norwegian romance style used by Edvard Grieg and Ole Bull. This makes him somewhat conservative concerning developments within the classical music of the 20th century. While still young he could be characterized as radically innovative. === Theathre music (in selection) === * Halte-Hulda (lyriks: B. Bj\u00f8rnson), op. 20, performed in 1919. * Purpur (lyriks: H.
