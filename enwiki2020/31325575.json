Dentu et Cie, Editeurs, Paris, 1887.), was a French soprano, associated with op\u00e9ra-bouffe in Paris and the USA in the mid-19th century, particularly in the works of Offenbach.G\u00e4nzl K. The Encyclopaedia of the Musical Theatre. Blackwell, Oxford, 1994. ==Life and career== Tost\u00e9e's first role at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes Parisiens was as Scipionne in Les vivandi\u00e8res de la grande-arm\u00e9e in 1859, swiftly followed by a revival of La rose de Saint-Flour, and she remained a star in the Paris op\u00e9ra-bouffe from the early 1860s to her death. She created roles in Offenbachs\u2019s Le pont des soupirs (Amoroso, 1861), Les bavards (B\u00e9atrix, 1862), and Il signor Fagotto (Fabricio, 1863). She toured with the Bouffes company to Vienna in 1861 and 1862, appearing at the Theater am Franz-Josefs-Kai. In 1867 she travelled to New York to appear at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, starring in Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Lischen et Fritzchen and Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers. Later the emergence of Zulma Bouffar diminished her opportunities. Other creations included Gotte in the collaborative work Les musiciens de l\u2019orchestre, L\u00e9onore in Le roman comique, and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Bouffe in La tradition by Delibes.Yon, Jean- Claude.
