    "text": "A focal-plane shutter. The metal shutter blades travel vertically. In camera design, a focal-plane shutter (FPS) is a type of photographic shutter that is positioned immediately in front of the focal plane of the camera, that is, right in front of the photographic film or image sensor. == Two-curtain shutters == The traditional type of focal-plane shutter in 35 mm cameras, pioneered by Leitz for use in its Leica cameras, uses two shutter curtains, made of opaque rubberized fabric, that run horizontally across the film plane. For slower shutter speeds, the first curtain opens (usually) from right to left, and after the required time with the shutter open, the second curtain closes the aperture in the same direction. When the shutter is cocked again the shutter curtains are moved back to their starting positions, ready to be released. Focal-plane shutter, low speed Focal-plane shutter at low speed Figure 1: The black rectangle represents the frame aperture through which the exposure is made. It is currently covered by the first shutter curtain, shown in red. The second shutter curtain shown in green is on the right side. Figure 2: The first shutter curtain moves fully to the left allowing the exposure to be made. At this point, the flash is made to fire if one is attached and ready to do so. Figure 3: After the required amount of exposure the second shutter curtain moves to the left to cover the frame aperture. When the shutter is recocked the shutter curtains are wound back to the right-hand side ready for the next exposure. This is a graphical representation only; the actual mechanisms are much more complex. For example, the shutter curtains actually roll on and off spools at either side of the frame aperture so as to use as little space as possible. Faster shutter speeds are achieved by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; this results in a vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster shutter speeds simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied. Focal-plane shutter, high speed Focal-plane shutter at high speed Figure 1: The black rectangle represents the frame aperture through which the exposure is made. It is currently covered by the first shutter curtain, shown in red. The second shutter curtain shown in green is on the right side. Figure 2: The first shutter curtain begins to move to the left allowing the exposure to be made. Because the exposure requires a very fast shutter speed, the second curtain begins to move across at a set distance from the first one. Figure 3: The first shutter curtain continues to travel across the frame aperture followed by the second curtain. It would be pointless to use an electronic flash with this shutter speed as the short duration flash would expose only a very small amount of the frame as the rest is covered by either the first or second shutter curtain. Figure 4: The first shutter curtain finishes moving, followed closely by the second curtain which is now covering the frame aperture completely. When the shutter is recocked both shutter curtains are wound back to the right-hand side ready for the next exposure. == Vertical-travel shutters == Vertical-travel focal-plane shutter firing at 1/500 of a second \u2013 the gap between the curtains is clearly visible near the bottom. Most modern 35 mm and digital SLR cameras now use vertical travel metal blade shutters. These work in precisely the same way as the horizontal shutters, but because of the shorter distance the shutter blades must travel (24 mm as opposed to 36 mm), the shutter blades can travel across the film plane in less time. This can result in faster flash synchronization speeds than are possible with the horizontal-curtain focal-plane shutter, and the shutter can reliably provide higher speeds (up to 1/12000 of a second). == Advantages == One of the advantages of focal-plane shutters is that the shutter can be built into the body of a camera that accepts interchangeable lenses, eliminating the need for each lens to have a central shutter built into it. Another advantage of the focal-plane shutter is that their fastest speeds are quite high: 1/4000 secondAnonymous, K200D/K20D: Pentax. no city of publication: Pentax Corp., 2008. pp 33-34. or even 1/8000 second;Anonymous, Canon EOS System Spring 2008.

San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1992. . pp 65-66. (See The Square-type metal-bladed focal-plane shutter and The quest for higher speed, below.) == Disadvantages == Dixi race car. The distortion is caused by a shutter wiping downward in the focal plane (upward in the scene). exposed differently due to a lightning strike that occurred during the exposure. A similar effect occurs if electronic flash is used when the shutter is set faster than X-sync. The main disadvantage of the focal-plane shutter is that a durable and reliable one is a complex (and often expensive) device. While the concept of a travelling slit shutter is simple, a modern FP shutter is a computerized microsecond accurate timer,Goldberg, Camera Technology' p 78 governing sub- gram masses of exotic materials,Anonymous, \"Modern Tests: Nikon FM2: Fastest Shutter and Sync\" pp 98-101, 112.

Popular Photography & Imaging, Volume 72 Number 3; March 2008. . This is why FP shutters are seldom seen in compact or point- and-shoot cameras. In addition, the typical focal-plane shutter has flash synchronization speeds that are slower than the typical leaf shutter's 1/500 s,Peter Kolonia, \"The War Continues: 35 mm Vs. 2\u00bc: Does moving to 2\u00bc from 35 mm really pay back in quality what you lose in convenience?\" pp 76-83. Popular Photography, Volume 59 Number 11; November 1995. . p 78. because the first curtain has to open fully and the second curtain must not start to close until the flash has fired. In other words, the very narrow slits of fast speeds will not be properly flash exposed. The fastest X-sync speed on a 35 mm camera is traditionally 1/60 s for horizontal Leica-type FP shutters and 1/125 s for vertical Square-type FP shutters.Goldberg, Camera Technology. pp 221-223.Alan Horder; editor, The Manual of Photography. (formerly The Ilford Manual of Photography.) Sixth edition. Philadelphia, PA: Chilton Book Company/Focal Press Limited, 1971. . pp 174, 197-199.Michael J. Langford, Advanced Photography: A Grammar of Techniques. Fourth Edition. New York, NY: Focal Press Limited, 1980. (USA edition). pp 91-99. Modern FP shutters have increased X-sync to 1/250 s with the use of exotic ultra-strong materials and computer control, and 1/8000 s through electronic sleight of hand. (See The quest for higher speed and Breaking the X-sync barrier, below.) Focal-plane shutters may also produce image distortion of very fast-moving objects or when panned rapidly, as described in the Rolling shutter article. A large relative difference between a slow wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit results in cartoonish distortion, because one side of the frame is exposed at a noticeably later instant than the other and the object's interim movement is imaged. For a horizontal Leica-type FP shutter, the image is stretched if the object moves in the same direction as the shutter curtains, and compressed if travelling in the opposite direction of them. For a downward-firing vertical Square-type FP shutter, the top of the image leans forward.Michael J. Langford, Basic Photography: A Primer for Professionals. Third Edition. Garden City, NY: Amphoto/Focal Press Limited, 1973. . pp 109-111.Goldberg, Camera Technology. pp 80-86, 115-117. In fact, the use of leaning to give the impression of speed in illustration is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow wiping vertical FP shutters of large format cameras from the first half of the 20th century.Robert G. Mason and Norman Snyder; editors. The Camera. Life Library of Photography. New York City: TIME-LIFE Books, 1970. No ISBN. pp 162-163. == Electro-optical shutters == Instead of using relatively slow-moving mechanical shutter curtains, electro-optic devices such as Pockels cells can be employed as shutters. While not commonly used, they completely avoid the problems associated with travelling-curtain shutters such as flash synchronisation limitations and image distortions when the object is moving. Such shutters are significantly more costly than mechanical shutters. == Rotary focal-plane shutter == Besides the horizontal Leica and vertical Square FP shutters, other types of FP shutters exist. The most prominent is the rotary or sector FP shutter. The rotary disc shutter is common in film movie cameras, but rare in still cameras. These spin a round metal plate with a sector cutout in front of the film. In theory, rotary shutters can control their speeds by narrowing or widening the sector cutout (by using two overlapping plates and varying the overlap) and/or by spinning the plate faster or slower.Goldberg, Camera Technology pp 86-87. However, for simplicity's sake, most still camera rotary shutters have fixed cutouts and vary the spinning speed. The Olympus Pen F and Pen FT (1963 and 1966, both from Japan) half frame 35 mm SLRs spun a semicircular titanium plate to 1/500 s.Jason Schneider, \"The Camera Collector: Half-frame 35's of the 60's, Part 3. Wherein collectors immortalize the only SLRs of their kind\" pp 64, 75. Modern Photography, Volume 39, Number 2; February 1975. . Semicircular rotary shutters also have the advantage of unlimited X-sync speed, but all rotary FP shutters have the disadvantage of the bulk required for the plate spin. The Univex Mercury (1938, USA) half frame 35 mm camera had a very large dome protruding out the top of the main body to accommodate its 1/1000 s rotary shutter.S. F. Spira with Eaton S. Lothrop, Jr and Jonathan R. Spira. The History of Photography as Seen Through the Spira Collection. New York, NY: Aperture, 2001 . pp 154, 159-160. They also produce very unusual distortion at very high speed because of the angular sweep of the exposure wipe. Bulk can be reduced by substituting blade sheaves for the plate, but then the rotary FP shutter essentially becomes a regular bladed FP shutter.Norman Goldberg, \"3 new shutters: how they work\" pp 74-77, 124. Popular Photography, Volume 82, Number 3; March 1975. . == Revolving drum focal-plane shutter == Back inside view of Widelux F7 panoramic camera, where the slit shutter goes by the film Front view of the Widelux showing the rotating lens cylinder The revolving drum is an unusual FP shutter that has been used in several specialized panoramic cameras such as the Panon Widelux (1959, Japan) and KMZ Horizont (1968, Soviet Union).John Wade, The Collector's Guide to Classic Cameras: 1945\u20131985. Small Dole, UK: Hove Books, 1999. . pp 113-117. Instead of using an extremely short focal length (wide-angle) lens to achieve an extra-wide field of view, these cameras have a medium-wide lens encapsulated in a drum with a rear vertical slit. As the entire drum is horizontally pivoted on the lens's rear nodal point, the slit wipes an extra-wide-aspect image onto film held against a curved focal plane.Kraszna-Krausz, A.; chairman of the editorial board, The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography. Revised Desk Edition, 1973 reprint. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1969. no ISBN. p 1048. The Widelux produced a 140\u00b0 wide image in a 24\u00d759 mm frame on 135 film with a Lux 26 mm f/2.8 lens and controlled shutter speed by varying rotation speed on a fixed slit width.Anonymous. \"Modern Photography's Annual Guide to 47 Top Cameras: Widelux F-7\" p 158.

In the Kodak Cirkut (1907, USA) and Globus Globuscope (1981, USA) cameras, the entire camera and lens revolved as the film was pulled past the slit in the opposite direction. The Globuscope produced a 360\u00b0 angle of view image in a 24\u00d7160 mm frame on 135 film with a 25 mm lens and had adjustable slit width with a constant rotation speed.John Owens, \"Whirled Tour: Lessons from an all- around photographer,\" pp 12-13.

Popular Photography & Imaging, Volume 70 Number 7; July 2006. .Wade, Collector's Guide pp 117-118. Revolving FP shutters produce images with unusual distortion where the image center seems to bulge toward the viewer, while the periphery appears to curve away because the lens's field of view changes as it swivels. This distortion will disappear if the photograph is mounted on a circularly curved support and viewed with the eye at the center.Roger W. Hicks, \"Panoramic Cameras; Gear To Help You Get The WIDE View,\" Shutterbug; January 2006 from http://www.shutterbug.com/equipmentreviews/35mm_cameras/0106panoramic/index.html retrieved 7 January 2008. Revolving shutters must also rotate smoothly; otherwise, uneven exposure will result in ugly vertical banding in the image. Since the rotation may take several seconds to complete, no matter the shutter speed, the camera should be tripod mounted. For the same reason, flash cannot be used with these cameras.Dan Richards, \"Hands On: Noblex ProSport: Can a serious panoramist find happiness with a sub-$1000 camera? Does the Noblex lens swivel?\" pp 48, 50, 58. Popular Photography, Volume 63, Number 7; July 1999. These cameras are often used for photographing large groups of people (e.g. the 'school' photograph). For this purpose, the subjects are arranged in a shortened semicircle with the camera at the centre such that all the subjects are the same distance from the camera and facing the camera. Once the exposure is made and processed, the panoramic print shows everyone in a straight line facing in the same direction. The distortion present in the background betrays the technique. == History and technical development == The earliest daguerreotype (invented 1839) photographic cameras did not have shutters, because the lack of sensitivity of the process and the small apertures of available lenses meant that exposure times were measured in many minutes. A photographer could easily control exposure time by removing and returning the camera lens' lens cap or plug.Langford, 3rd ed. p 104. However, during the 19th century, as one increased-sensitivity process replaced another, and larger apertures lenses became available, exposure times shortened to seconds and then to fractions of seconds. Exposure timing control mechanisms became a necessary accessory and then a standard camera feature.Michael R. Peres; editor in chief, Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: Digital Imaging, Theory and Applications, History, and Science. Fourth Edition. Boston, Massachusetts: Focal Press/Elsevier, 2007. . pp 27-35, 51-59. === Single-curtain focal-plane shutter === The earliest manufactured shutter was the drop shutterPeres, p 58. of the 1870s. This was an accessory guillotine-like device \u2013 a wooden panel with slit cutout mounted on rails in front of the camera lens that gravity dropped at a controlled rate. As the slit passed the lens, it \"wiped\" the exposure onto the photographic plate. With rubber bands to increase the drop speed, a 1/500 or 1/1000 s shutter speed could be reached. Eadweard Muybridge used shutters of this type in his famous trotting horse studies.Mason and Snyder, p 136. By the 1880s, lens front mounted accessory shutter boxes were available,Cornell Capa; editorial director, ICP Encyclopedia of Photography. New York, NY: Crown Publishers Inc., 1984. . p 460. containing a rubberized silk cloth curtain (also called a blind) with one or more width slit cutouts wound around two parallel drums and using springs to pull a slit from one drum to the other. These shutters offered a wide range of shutter speeds by adjusting the spring tension and selecting a slit width.Langford, 3rd ed. p 105. In 1883, Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz (Germany) patented a camera with an internal roller blind shutter mechanism, just in front of the photographic plate. Thus the focal-plane shutter in modern recognizable form was born.Todd Gustavson, Camera: A History of Photography From Daguerreotype to Digital. New York, NY: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2009. . p 32. Goerz manufactured the Ansch\u00fctz Camera (Germany) as the first production FP shutter camera in 1890.Colin Harding, Classic Cameras. Lewes, East Sussex, UK: Photographers\u2019 Institute Press, 2009. . pp 80-81. Francis Blake invented a type of focal plane shutter camera by 1889 that achieved shutter speeds of 1/2000 second, and exhibited numerous stop-action photographs.Elton W. Hall, Francis Blake: An Inventor's Life, Massachusetts Historical Society, 2004 Note that a drop shutter-like mechanism with adjustable slit was used at the focal plane of an apparently one-off William England camera in 1861 and this is considered the first FP shutter of any kind. Single curtain, vertical travelling, fixed-width slit, focal-plane shutters with adjustable spring tension and slit-width selection remained popular in large and medium format cameras for the next half-century. The lens on a single curtain FP shutter camera must have its lens cap on when the shutter is cocked; otherwise the film will be double exposed when the blind's cutout re-passes the film gate. A camera-mounted FP shutter's main advantage over the competing interlens leaf shutter was ability to use a very narrow slit to offer an action stopping 1/1000 second shutter speed at a time when leaf shutters topped out at 1/250 s \u2013 although the available contemporaneous ISO 1 to 3 equivalent speed emulsions limited the opportunities to use the high speeds.Lothrop & Schneider, \"The SLR: Part 1,\" p 43. However, these older focal-plane shutters wiped the exposure fairly slowly, even under the highest available spring tension, because the delicate curtain was too fragile to survive the necessary accelerative shocks to move faster. The large relative difference between a slow downward wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit resulted in cartoonish distortion of very fast moving objects instead of truly freezing their motion.(See Section 4: \"Disadvantages,\" above.) Folmer and Schwing (USA) was the most famous proponent of single curtain FP shutters, with their large format sheet film Graflex single-lens reflex and Graphic press cameras using them from 1905 to 1973. Their most common 4\u00d75 inch shutters had four slit widths ranging from 1\u00bd to \u215b inch and up to six spring tensions for a speed range of 1/10 to 1/1000 second.Anonymous, Graflex and Graphic Focal Plane Shutter Photography.

Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1962. no ISBN. pp 111-113. === Leica-type dual-curtain focal-plane shutter === Shutter curtains of a Zorki 1c, similar to Leica II In 1925, the Leica A (Germany) 35 mm camera was introduced with a dual-cloth- curtain, horizontal-travelling-slit, focal-plane shutter.Jason Schneider, \"The Camera Collector: You can't beat the system. Leitz knew that over 50 years ago, and proceeded to give us the world's first 'system 35.'\" pp 54-56. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 6; June 1984. .Anonymous, \"Test: Leica 0-series: What's it like to shoot with a 1923 Leica replica? Inconvenient as hell\u2014and lots of fun!\" pp 86-90, 208-209. Popular Photography, Volume 65 Number 9; September 2001. . A dual curtain FP shutter does not have precut slits and the spring tension is not adjustable. The exposure slit is formed by drawing open the first curtain onto one drum and then pulling closed the second curtain off a second drum after a clockwork escapement timed delay (imagine two overlapping window shades) and moves at one speed (technically the curtains are still accelerating slightly) across film gate. Faster shutter speeds are provided by timing the second shutter curtain to close sooner after the first curtain opens and narrowing the slit wiping the film (see schematic figures above). Dual curtain FP shutters are self-capping; the curtains are designed to overlap as the shutter is cocked to prevent double exposure.Goldberg, Camera Technology. pp 78-79. Although self-capping dual curtain FP shutters date back to the late 19th century,Jason Schneider, \u201cThe Camera Collector: Zeiss-Ikon\u2019s answer to the Leica was the Contax, a camera praised and damned for its brilliantly complex design.\u201d pp 18, 22-23, 150. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 10; October 1984. . the Leica design made them popular and virtually all FP shutters introduced since 1925 are dual curtain models. As perfected in the 1954 Leica M3 (West Germany),Jason Schneider, \"The Camera Collector: I'm still no Leica collector, but the best of 'em exemplify 'form follows function'.\" pp 50, 52, 54-55. Modern Photography, Volume 47, Number 10; October 1983. .John Wade, The Collector's Guide to Classic Cameras: 1945\u20131985. Small Dole, UK: Hove Books, 1999. . pp 79-80. a typical Leica-type horizontal FP shutter for 35 mm cameras is pre- tensioned to traverse the 36 millimeter wide film gate in 18 milliseconds (at 2 meters per second) and supports slit widths for a speed range of 1 to 1/1000 s. A minimum 2 mm wide slit produces a maximum 1/1000 s effective shutter speed. Note that the dual curtain FP shutter suffers the same fast speed distortion problems as the single curtain type. Similar technology FP shutters were also common in medium format 120 roll film cameras. Horizontal cloth FP shutters are normally limited to 1/1000 s maximum speed because of the difficulties in precisely timing extremely narrow slits and the unacceptable distortion resulting from a relatively slow wipe speed. Their maximum flash synchronization speed is also limited because the slit is fully open only to the film gate (36 mm wide or wider) and able to be flash exposed up to 1/60 s X-synchronization (nominal; 18 ms = 1/55 s actual maximum; in reality, a 40 mm slit to allow for variance gives 1/50 s \u2153 stop slow). (See Section 4: \"Disadvantages,\" above.) Some horizontal FP shutters managed to exceed these limits by narrowing the slit or increasing curtain velocity beyond the norm. However, these tended to be sophisticated ultra-high precision models used in expensive professional-level cameras. The first such shutter was to be found in the Konica F, released in February 1960. Called the Hi-Synchro, this shutter reached the speed of 1/2000s and made possible flash synchronization at 1/125s. === Square-type metal-bladed focal-plane shutter === In 1960, the Konica F (Japan) 35 mm SLR began a long term incremental increase in maximum shutter speeds with its \"High Synchro\" FP shutter.Peres, p 780. This shutter greatly improved efficiency over the typical Leica shutter by using stronger metal blade sheaves that were \"fanned\" much faster, vertically along the minor axis of the 24\u00d736 mm frame. As perfected in 1965 by Copal, the Copal Square's slit traversed the 24 mm high film gate in 7 msPeterson, pp 21, 52. (3.4 m/s). This doubled flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s. In addition, a minimum 1.7 mm wide slit would double top shutter speed to a maximum 1/2000 s. Note, most Squares were derated to 1/1000 s in the interest of reliability.Rudolph Lea, The Register of 35 mm Single Lens Reflex Cameras: From 1936 to the Present. Second Edition. H\u00fcckelhoven, Germany: Rita Wittig Fachbuchverlag, 1993. . pp 30-31, 47, 68-69, 121-126, 173-174. The Square's metal blades were also immune to the drying out, rotting and pinholing that cloth curtained shutters could suffer from as they aged.Anonymous. \"Too Hot to Handle,\" p 59. Volume 47, Number 3; March 1983. .Stephen Gandy, \u201cUSED Leica M Buyer's Check List,\u201d from http://www.cameraquest.com/leicamchecklist.htm retrieved 5 January 2006. In addition, Squares came from the supplier as complete drop-in modules, so camera designers could concentrate on camera design and leave shutter design to specialist subcontractors. This had previously been an advantage of leaf shutters.Goldberg, \"3 new shutters,\" p 77. Square-type FP shutters were originally bulky in size and noisy in operation, limiting their popularity in the 1960s among camera designers and photographers. Although Konica and Nikkormat were major users of the Copal Square, many other brands including Asahi Pentax, Canon, Leica and Minolta continued to refine the Leica-type shutter for reliability, if not speed; moving from three axis to four axis designs (one control axis for each curtain drum axis, instead of one control for both drums).Goldberg, Camera Technology pp 71-72. New compact and quieter Square designs, with simpler construction and greater reliability, were introduced in the 1970s.Herbert Keppler, \"Keppler on the SLR: Pentax sets out to knock off Canon and Olympus with smallest SLR's ever \u2013 Rollei's unbelievable SL2000\" pp 55-57, 186, 208, 212-214, 230. Modern Photography, Volume 40, Number 12; December 1976. . The most notable were the Copal Compact Shutter (CCS), introduced by the Konica Autoreflex TC (1976),Norman Goldberg, Michele Frank and Leif Ericksenn. \"Lab Report: Konica Autoreflex TC\" pp 118-121, 140-141, 173, 191.

Modern Photography, Volume 41, Number 4; April 1977. . The vertical blade type supplanted the horizontal cloth type as the dominant FP shutter type in the 1980s. Even Leica Camera (originally E. Leitz), long a champion of the horizontal cloth FP shutter for its quietness, switched to a vertical metal FP shutter in 2006 for its first digital rangefinder (RF) camera, the Leica M8 (Germany).Anonymous, Leica M System: The fascination of the moment \u2013 analog and digital. Solms, Germany: Leica Camera, 2006. pp 62-63. Note that the Contax (Germany) 35 mm RF camera of 1932 had a vertical travel FP shutter with dual brass-slatted roller blinds with adjustable spring tension and slit width, and a top speed of 1/1000 s (the Contax II of 1936 had a claimed 1/1250 s top speed), but it was woefully unreliable and not an antecedent of the modern Square shutter.Jason Schneider, \"The Camera Collector: Zeiss-Ikon's answer to the Leica was the Contax, a camera praised and damned for its brilliantly complex design.\" pp 18, 22-23, 150. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 10; October 1984. .Jason Schneider, \"The Camera Collector: The Contax saga, Part II. The world's best rangefinder made it the pro 35 of the 30s.\" pp 44-45, 62-63. Modern Photography, Volume 48, Number 11; November 1984. . === Quest for higher speed === Although the Square shutter improved the FP shutter in most ways, it still limited maximum flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s (unless using special long-burn FP flash bulbs that burn throughout the slit wipe, making slit width irrelevant.Langford, Advanced Photography pp 76-77.Langford, 5th ed. p 55.). Any quality leaf shutter of the 1960s could achieve at least 1/500 s flash sync. Greater FP shutter X-sync speed would require further strengthening the curtains, by using exotic materials, allowing them to move even faster and widen the slits. Copal collaborated with Nippon Kogaku to improve the Compact Square shutter for the Nikon FM2 (Japan) of 1982 by using honeycomb pattern etched titanium foil, stronger and lighter than plain stainless steel, for its blade sheaves. This permitted cutting shutter-curtain travel time by nearly half to 3.6 ms (at 6.7 m/s) and allowed 1/200 s flash X-sync speed. A bonus was a distortionless top speed of 1/4000 s (with 1.7 mm slit).\"Modern Tests: Nikon FM2\" pp 98, 101. The Nikon FE2 (Japan), with an improved version of this shutter, had a 3.3 ms (at 7.3 m/s) curtain travel time and boosted X-sync speed to 1/250 s in 1983. The top speed remained 1/4000 s (with 1.8 mm slit).Anonymous. \"Modern Tests: Nikon FE2 Adds Superfast Shutter And Much More\" pp 86-92. Modern Photography, Volume 47, Number 10; October 1983. . The fastest focal-plane shutter ever used in a film camera was the 1.8 ms curtain travel time (at 13.3 m/s) duralumin and carbon fiber bladed one introduced by the Minolta Maxxum 9xi (named Dynax 9xi in Europe, \u03b1-9xi in Japan) in 1992.

In 1966, the VEB Pentacon Praktica electronic (East Germany) was the first SLR with an electronically controlled FP shutter.Lea, pp 11, 240-241. It used electronic circuitry to time its shutter instead of the traditional spring/gear/lever clockwork mechanisms. In 1971, the Asahi Pentax Electro Spotmatic (Japan; name shortened to Asahi Pentax ES in 1972; called Honeywell Pentax ES in USA) tied its electronically controlled shutter to its exposure control light meter to provide electronic aperture-priority autoexposure.Danilo Cecchi, Asahi Pentax and Pentax SLR 35 mm Cameras: 1952\u20131989.

Spring powered geartrains become inadequate to durably control and reliably time any higher accelerations and shocks.Langford, Advanced Photography pp 55-56. For example, some highly tensioned FP shutters could suffer from \"shutter curtain bounce.\" This phenomenon is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 if the curtains are not properly braked after crossing the film gate, they might crash and bounce; reopening the shutter and causing double exposure ghosting bands on the image edge.Herbert Keppler, editor, 124 Ways You Can Test Cameras Lenses And Equipment.

As the Square-type FP shutter's blades moved faster and faster to provide shorter and shorter shutter speeds, the need for better blade timing control only increased. At first, electromagnets controlled by analogue resistor/capacitor timers were used to govern the release of the second shutter curtain (though still operated by spring power).Goldberg, Camera Technology pp 76-77.

In theory, the longest available speed is limited only by available battery power for the electronics. This caught some 1970s photographers by surprise when they attempted very long \"B\" exposures and found their camera batteries had died in the middle because of the era's power hungry electronics and ruined the exposure. === Breaking the X-sync barrier === Electronics are also responsible for pushing the focal-plane shutter's X-sync speed beyond its mechanical limits. As stated earlier, a horizontal FP shutter for 35 mm cameras is fully open and usable only for flash exposure up to 1/60 s, while vertical FP shutters are usually limited to 1/125 s. At higher speeds, a normal 1 millisecond electronic flash burst would expose only the part open to the slit. (See Sections 4: \"Disadvantages,\" and 7.2 \"The Leica-type dual curtain focal-plane shutter,\" above.) In 1986, the Olympus OM-4T (Japan) introduced a system that could synchronize a specially dedicated accessory Olympus F280 Full Synchro electronic flash to pulse its light at a 20 kilohertz rate for up to 40 ms, to illuminate its horizontal FP shutter's slit as it crossed the entire film gate \u2013 in effect, simulating long-burn FP flashbulbs \u2013 allowing flash exposure at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000 s. This allowed daylight plus fill-flash use in almost any situation. However, there is a concomitant loss of flash range.Anonymous. \"Modern Tests: Olympus OM-4T: More Than Just A Titanium Armored SLR\" pp 46-50, 78.

Leaf shutter cameras are not affected by this issue \u2013 they have completely different limitations. === Focal-plane shutters today === Focal-plane shutter top speed peaked at 1/16,000 s (and 1/500 s X-sync) in 1999 with the Nikon D1 digital SLR. The D1 used electronic assist from its sensor for the 1/16,000 s speed and its 15.6\u00d723.7 mm \"APS-size\" sensor was smaller than 35 mm film and therefore easier to cross quickly for 1/500 s X-sync.McNamara, Michael J. \"New Frontiers: Nikon's D1: Has the perfect digital SLR arrived, or is it just a glimpse of what's to come?\" pp 50, 52, 54. Popular Photography, Volume 64 Number 8; August 2000. . However, with very limited need for such extremely fast speeds, FP shutters retreated to 1/8000 s in 2003 (and 1/250 s X-sync in 2006) \u2013 even in professional level cameras. In addition, since no specialized timers are needed for extremely slow speeds, the slowest speed setting is usually 30 s. Instead, over the last twenty years, most effort has gone into improving durability and reliability. Whereas the best mechanically controlled shutters were rated for 150,000 cyclesAnonymous, \"Modern Tests: Nikon F3: Successor to Nikon F2 and F\" pp 112-121, 124, 128. Modern Photography, Volume 44, Number 6; June 1980. . and had an accuracy of \u00b1\u00bc stop from nominal value (more typically 50,000 cycles at \u00b1\u00bd stop), today's best electronically controlled FP shutters can last 300,000 cycles and have no noticeable speed error.McNamara, \"Nikon D3\" p 83. In last few years, digital point-and-shoot cameras have been using timed electronic sampling of the image sensor, replacing the traditional mechanical leaf shutter, with delicate moving parts that can wear out, used by film-based point-and-shoot units. Something similar is now also occurring with more sophisticated digital cameras that, in the past, would have used focal-plane shutters. For example, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 (2011, Japan) interchangeable lens digital camera has an FP shutter, but in its 20 frames per second SH Burst mode, it locks its mechanical shutter open and electronically scans its digital sensor, although with resolution reduced to 4 megapixels from 16 MP.Philip Ryan, \u201cLab: ILC Test: Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G3: Tiny Terror: Good Things Come In Panasonic\u2019s Small Package,\u201d pp 72, 74, 76, 100.
