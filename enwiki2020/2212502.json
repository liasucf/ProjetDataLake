New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization.Tong Yi. \"China\u2019s Latest Theft\". The New York Times, February 16, 2000. Because of Ding Zilin's efforts Amnesty International has a political campaign to put pressure on the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens.

She does, however, acknowledge that in 1995 Hillary Clinton helped to get her released from one of her many incarcerations. Ding Zilin condemned former President Bill Clinton for attending a ceremonial red carpet appearance in Tiananmen Square: \u201cWith the blood of the students still wet, the wounds still there, unhealed, how could Clinton step onto the red carpet to review Chinese troops?\u201d.
