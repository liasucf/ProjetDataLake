New Zealand Women Artists Reed Methuen, 1986Brownson, Ron. Art Toi: New Zealand Art at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki Auckland Art Gallery Toi O Tamaki, 2011 Her work is recognised for \"its expressive intensity, her use of high key colour, and her gritty address of political issues related to M\u0101ori land rights and the Treaty of Waitangi\". A largely self-taught artist, Karaka credits many figures in New Zealand art as mentors, including Greer Twiss, Colin McCahon, Gretchen Albrecht, Tony Fomison, Arnold Manaaki Wilson, Philip Clairmont and Allan Maddox. In a 2014 interview she said: > Greer Twiss was my teacher at intermediate school, and I met Colin McCahon > at Greer's house when I was 12. They became my kaitiaki. They steered me > away from Tamaki College because they didn't consider the arts curriculum > there was sufficient, and steered me to Auckland Girls' Grammar. That was > great because I had people like Liz Mountain [Elizabeth Ellis]. She'd just > come out of training school so she had a lot of energy and the commitment to > keep to your cultural landscape and develop it. Karaka is seen as part of the first generation of contemporary M\u0101ori artists and she is often placed alongside painters Robyn Kahukiwa and Kura Te Waru Rewiri in discussions of New Zealand art history. ==Recent exhibitions== Two Artists: Emily Karaka & Shona Rapira Davies, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, 2015. Curated by Megan Tamati-Quennell, this exhibition contrasted the work of these two senior female M\u0101ori artists and explored how their early work aligned with the 'Mana Wahine' movement; 'a movement that developed from the momentum of the feminist art and M\u0101ori protest movements of the 1970s'. Five M\u0101ori Painters, Auckland Art Gallery, 2014. Curated by Ngahiraka Mason, this exhibition brought together the work of senior artists Karaka, Robyn Kahukiwa, and Kura Te Waru Rewiri with artists from a younger generation, Saffron Te Ratana and Star Gossage. ==References== ==Further information== *The Big Art Trip Series 1 Episode 2 features Emily Karaka *Five M\u0101ori Painters: Emily Karaka interview recorded by Auckland Art Gallery 2014 *Emily Karaka talks about her 1984 work The Treaties audio-recording from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa *Interview with Ngahiraka Mason, curator of Five M\u0101ori Painters Standing Room Only, Radio New Zealand National, 2014 *Personal and political Shona Rapira Davies and Emily Karaka interviewed by curator Megan Tamati-Quennell *Emily Karaka in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Category:New Zealand artists Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Auckland Category:20th- century New Zealand women artists Category:21st-century New Zealand women artists ",
