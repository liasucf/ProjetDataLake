    "text": "Goat Girl are a post-punk band from South London. Their line up consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Lottie Cream (Lottie Pendlebury) , guitarist and occasional lead vocalist L.E.D. (Ellie Rose Davies), bassist Naima Jelly (Naima Redina-Bock) and drummer Rosy Bones (Rosy Jones). UK music magazine DIY describe them as being \"imbued with an innate ability to voice the socio- political concerns of their peers with wit and style\". In 2019 bassist Holy Hole (Holly Mullineaux) joined the band, replacing Naima Jelly. ==Formation and signing to Rough Trade== The band played early gigs in The Windmill, Brixton and named themselves after comedian Bill Hicks' character 'Goat Boy'. They signed a deal with Rough Trade Records on 24 July 2016 - the day after the UK's Brexit referendum - and put out a couple of singles prior to the release of their debut album two years later. During this time, they also supported The Fall in their final London show before Mark E. Smith's death, at the 100 Club on 27 July 2017. ==Debut album== Their self-titled debut album was released in April 2018. Featuring 19 tracks, it was well-received by the music press. Pitchfork described it as \"absurd, playful, and more than a little unsettling, sounding at times like a less romantic Libertines,\" going on to say the album, \"appears daunting but proves to be light and accessible, with plenty of offbeat wit and many an unexpected twist down gothic country roads.\" The Guardian called it, \"a weird, wily and unpredictable record, getting under the surface of things.\" The band played on the John Peel stage at the Glastonbury Festival 2019. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Goat Girl (2018), Rough Trade *On All Fours (2021), Rough Trade === EPs === * Udder Sounds (2018), Rough Trade ===Singles=== *\"Country Sleaze\"/\"Scum\" (2016), Rough Trade *\"Crow Cries\" (2017), Rough Trade *\"Cracker Drool\" (2017), Rough Trade *\"The Man\" (2018), Rough Trade *\"Throw Me a Bone\" (2018), Rough Trade *\"Sad Cowboy\" (2020), Rough Trade ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:English rock music groups Category:English post-punk music groups Category:Musical groups from London Category:Musical quartets Category:All-female bands Category:Rough Trade Records artists ",
