    "text": "Greatest Hits, also titled Garth Brooks in... The Life of Chris Gaines, is an album by American country music artist Garth Brooks, in which Brooks assumes the fictitious persona of Australian rock artist Chris Gaines. Originally, this album was intended to be the soundtrack for a movie called The Lamb that would star Brooks as a rock star recalling the different periods of his life. This album was purposely released a year in advance from the scheduled film release date to pique interest in Brooks performing rock instead of country. The Lamb, however, was never filmed due to financial and management problems. The album was released on September 28, 1999. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Creed's Human Clay, and also gained Brooks his first and to date only appearance in the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100, with \"Lost in You\", which peaked at No. 5\\. The track \"It Don't Matter to the Sun\" was later covered in 2005, by Rosie Thomas on her If Songs Could Be Held album, and later as a duet between Don Henley and Stevie Nicks on the Target edition of Henley's 2015 album Cass County. The track \"Right Now\" samples the chorus of The Youngbloods' 1969 hit \"Get Together\", while the track \"Maybe\" was previously recorded by Alison Krauss on her 1999 album Forget About It. On November 13, 1999, Brooks hosted Saturday Night Live as himself but performed the musical number (\"Way of the Girl\") as Chris Gaines without acknowledging to the audience that they were the same person. The album had disappointing sales compared to Brooks' previous albums, with some citing Brooks' image change of wig and make up, and the album's rock-star concept for this fact. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Garth Brooks (as Chris Gaines) \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar *Tommy Sims \u2013 acoustic guitar, keyboards, programming, backing vocals *Wayne Kirkpatrick \u2013 acoustic guitar, clavinet, keyboards, backing vocals *Gordon Kennedy \u2013 backing vocals, lead vocals on \"My Love Tells Me So\", acoustic, electric and bass guitars *Reggie Young \u2013 electric guitar *James \"Hutch\" Hutchison \u2013 bass guitar *Jimmie Lee Sloas \u2013 bass guitar *Rami Jaffee \u2013 Hammond B-3 organ *Phil Madeira \u2013 Hammond B-3 organ *Mike Lawler \u2013 clavinet, keyboards *Blair Masters \u2013 keyboards *Greg Phillinganes \u2013 keyboards *Matt Rollings \u2013 keyboards *Kenny Aronoff \u2013 drums *Eddie Bayers \u2013 drums *Dan Needham \u2013 drums *Chris McHugh \u2013 drums, percussion *Lenny Castro \u2013 percussion *Terry McMillan \u2013 percussion *Chris Harris \u2013 backing vocals *Mark Heimermann \u2013 backing vocals *Crystal Taliefero \u2013 backing vocals *J.B.
