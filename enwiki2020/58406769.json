Oti Rodr\u00edguez in ABC describes it as \"a surrealist cross between the sainete, the grotesque and the joke about a serious matter (Superman) that has completely lost any hint of sensibility\". Beatriz Mart\u00ednez in El Peri\u00f3dico says that is an \"intelligent comedy of adventures that through an addictive rhythm reflects on the Spanish idiosyncrasy, mediocrity and mediocrity as engines that drive our society\".Superl\u00f3pez: una inteligente comedia de aventuras in elperiodico.com More negative is Javier Oca\u00f1a in El Pa\u00eds who says \"Nothing is wrong: neither the interpreters nor the situations nor the dialogues nor the direction. And, nevertheless, not a grimace, because nothing is good enough to provoke a certain merrymaking\".Superh\u00e9roe para la familia ca\u00f1\u00ed en elpais.com ==References== Category:Spanish comedy films Category:2010s superhero films Category:Films based on Spanish comics Category:Spanish films Category:Films distributed by Disney Category:2018 films ",
