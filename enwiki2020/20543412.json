Under the Directory of the Ukrainian National Republic, he served as operations chief and then as general quartermaster of the Army of the Ukrainian National Republic. In 1920 he was promoted to brigadier general. After the war, Kapustiansky emigrated to Poland and then to France. Kapustiansky was a founder of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and a member of its Provid, or Directorate, from 1929 until his death in 1969.
