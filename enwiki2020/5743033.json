He left in 2005 and was replaced by Matt DuBiel. Initially Nine FM was not restricted to any content format, but after DuBiel became director, the playlist was tightened because of low ratings and less obscure songs were played. On May 19, 2006, Nine FM started airing Dance Factory FM on Saturday nights, which expanded to Friday nights after August 12, 2006. On May 10, 2007, it was announced that Dance Factory would be airing weeknights as well. While the weekend shows focused on DJ mixes from Bobby D, DJ Markski, To Kool Chris, Erik K, DJ Caffeine, Danny V, Alex Andros, DJ Jonny D, Zita Zee, Kevin Phoenix, and DJ MIXX; the weeknight shows would play dance hits all night long on Nine FM. In 2007, DuBiel left Nine FM and went on to program WERV, \"The River\".
