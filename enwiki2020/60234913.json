June 2014. ==History== Shalom University was originally established as a theological institute in 1959 called Theological School of Northern Congo (\u00c9cole de Th\u00e9ologie au Congo du Nord - E.T.C.N.). In 1961 it opened its doors in Banjwade 65 kilometers north of Kisangani. Three years later it had to temporarily interrupt its operations and was forced to relocate to Bunia because of the 1964 Simba rebellion. In 1967 the school moved to the current location of its main campus. The university continued to develop and in 1973 it changed its name to Institut Sup\u00e9rieur Th\u00e9ologique de Bunia (ISTB). It launched its first master's degree in theology in 1986. During the violent tribal fighting in Bunia during the Ituri Conflict, ISTB was seen as a neutral ground where warring tribes could meet and talk.Atido, George Pirwoth. \u201cFrom Seminary to University at Bunia: A Paradigmatic Mission Re-Focus.\u201d African urban Christian Identity: Emerging Patterns, Ed. Philomena Njeri Mwaura, J. Steven O\u2019Malley, Acton Publishers, 2016, pp. 165-194. Then, in 2007 the school took its current form as Shalom University of Bunia, offering 5 Faculties. The name Shalom (peace) was chosen because of the role the university played in the Ituri Conflict peace process. In 2011 Shalom University began offering its first doctorate program within the School of Evangelical Theology, and in 2015 Shalom University launched its 6th Faculty, the Faculty of Medicine. In February 2018, violence reignited in the territory of Djugu, just north of Bunia. Armed militias burned 70 villages to the ground, killed hundreds, and displaced over 100 000. Shalom University again played an active role in diffusing hostilities by hosting a public debate production put on by Radio Okapi that involved local politicians and humanitarian workers addressing the violence and how to bring it to an end. ==Partnerships and accreditations== Shalom University is accredited and recognized by presidential decree by the government of the DRC.N507/MINESU/CABMIN/FL/RS/2006.
