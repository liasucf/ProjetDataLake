    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1812 and 1813 were elections that, coinciding with President James Madison's re-election, had the Democratic- Republican Party lose two seats but still retain an overwhelming majority in the United States Senate. As in recent elections, the minority Federalists had gone into the elections with such a small share of Senate seats (6 out of 36, or 16.7%) that if they had won every one of the elections, they would still not have controlled a majority. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Change in composition == === Before the elections === Composition after September 1812 elections in the new state of Louisiana. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:800px;\" |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | DR | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} === Result of the regular elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:800px;\" |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | V | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | V | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} {| |- valign=top !
