    "text": "Alexandra Palace television tower, June 2012. The Alexandra Palace television station in North London () is one of the oldest television transmission sites in the world. What was at the time called \"high definition\" (405-line) TV broadcasts on VHF were beamed from this mast from 1936 until the outbreak of World War II. It then lay dormant until it was used very successfully to foil the German Y-Ger\u00e4t radio navigation system during the last stages of the Battle of Britain. After the war, it was reused for television until 1956, when it was superseded by the opening of the BBC's new main transmitting station for the London area at Crystal Palace. In 1982 Alexandra Palace became an active transmitting station again, with the opening of a relay transmitter to provide UHF television service to parts of North London poorly covered from Crystal Palace. The transmitter is owned and maintained by Arqiva. == Channels listed by frequency == ===Analogue radio (FM)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !kW !Service |- |103.3 MHz |0.05 |London Greek Radio |- |107.1 MHz |0.1 |Capital Xtra |} ===Digital radio (DAB)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !Block !kWRadio Listeners Guide 2010 !Operator |- |218.640 MHz |11B |0.2 |DRG London |- |222.064 MHz |11D |2 |Digital One |- |223.936 MHz |12A |0.1 |Switch London |- |225.648 MHz |12B |3.2 |BBC National DAB |- |227.360 MHz |12C |0.25 |CE London |} ===Digital television=== Digital television replaced the analogue television signals during the digital switchover of April 2012.
