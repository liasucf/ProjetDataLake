But it took until 1951 for the station to first sign-on.Broadcasting Yearbook 1952 page 191 KORK was owned by the Vegas Valley Broadcasting Company, located in the Hotel Thunderbird, and it was powered with only 250 watts. It was an NBC Radio Network affiliate, broadcasting a schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts. In 1955, it was bought by the Southwestern Broadcasting Company, which put Channel 3 KORK-TV (now KSNV) on the air in that same year. In 1961, KORK got an FM counterpart, 97.1 KORK-FM (now KXPT).Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-91 In 1968, KORK, airing a full service Middle of The Road format, moved to 920 kHz (today KRLV). Going to 920 allowed KORK to increase its daytime power to 5,000 watts. Meanwhile, Nevada Broadcasting, Incorporated, acquired the 1340 frequency, and began airing country music as 1340 KRAM. At this point, KRAM was powered at 1,000 watts by day, but still had to reduce power to 250 watts at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-128 It was an affiliate of the ABC Entertainment Radio Network. In 1985, the station was acquired by Southern Nevada Radio, which changed the call sign to KMTW. By the early 1990s, 1340 KMTW had become an all-news station, carrying CNN Headline News. In 1995, Far West Radio acquired the station. On August 9, the new owner changed its call sign to KRLV. It aired a talk radio format for several years. In 2004, Continental Broadcasting bought the station, putting on a Spanish-language format of music, news and sports. In August 2012, KRLV and 1230 KLAV were sold to Lotus Communications. In April 2015, KRLV flipped from its Spanish-language format to Fox Sports Radio. The format change gave Lotus four sports-programmed stations in the Las Vegas Valley: 1100 KWWN (ESPN Radio), 920 KBAD (NBC Sports Radio), 1460 KENO (ESPN Deportes Radio in Spanish), and KRLV. There are two other sports stations in Las Vegas as well, 1140 KXST (CBS Sports Radio) and 670 KMZQ (SB Nation Radio). In April 2017, Lotus acquired the radio rights to the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League, with KRLV to serve as the flagship station. It was also announced that KLAV's FM translator K255CT would switch to a simulcast of KRLV on 98.9 FM. The call sign was changed to KKGK on March 20, 2020; the KRLV call sign moved to the former KBAD. KKGK currently has rights to the Los Angeles Chargers radio network. ==References== ==External links== * * KGK Category:Radio stations established in 1951 Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:1951 establishments in Nevada Category:Lotus Communications stations Category:Los Angeles Chargers broadcasters Category:Vegas Golden Knights broadcasters ",
