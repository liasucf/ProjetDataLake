He had titled himself both as, \"Ashur is king, Erishum I is vice- regent\"da-\u0161\u00f9r LUGAL i-ri-\u0161u-um PA. and the, \u201cI\u0161\u0161i\u2019ak A\u0161\u0161ur\u201dki (\u201csteward of Assur\u201d), at a time when Assur was controlled by an oligarchy of the patriarchs of the prominent families and subject to the \u201cjudgment of the city\u201d, or d\u012bn alim. According to Veenhof, Erishum I\u2019s reign marks the period when the institution of the annually appointed limmu (eponym) was introduced. The Assyrian King List observes of his immediate predecessors, \u201cin all six kings known from bricks, whose limmu have not been marked/found\u201d. ==Biography== As Assur's merchant family firms vigorously pursued commercial expansion, Eri\u0161um I had established distant trading outposts in Anatolia referred to as karums. Karums were established along trade routes into Anatolia and included: Kanesh, Ankuwa, Hattusa, and eighteen other locations that have yet to be identified, some of which had been designated as \u201cwarbatums\u201d (satellites of and subordinate to the karums') The markets traded in: tin (inscribed AN.NA, Akkadian: annukum), textiles, lapis lazuli, iron, antimony, copper, bronze, wool, and grain, in exchange for gold and silver. Around 23,000 tablets have been found at Kanesh spanning a period of 129 years from the thirtieth year of Erishum I\u2019s reign through to that of Puzur-Ashur II or possibly Naram-Sin with the earliest from level II including copies of his inscriptions. These were discovered in 1948 with three other similar though fragmentary lists and two copies of an inscription of Erishum I detailing the regulations concerning the administration of justice in Assur, including the possibility of plaintiffs to obtain a r\u0101bi\u1e63um (attorney) to represent them: Following the example set by Erishum I's father (Ilu-shuma), he had proclaimed tax exemptions, or as Michael Hudson has interpreted, \"Erishum I proclaimed a remission of debts payable in silver, gold, copper, tin, barley, wool, down to chaff.\" This appears in an inscription on one side of a large broken block of alabaster,BM 115689, Ass. 16850. apparently described as a \u1e6duppu. The shallow depression on its top has led some to identify it as a door socket. His numerous contemporary inscriptions commemorate his building of the temple for Assur, called \u201cWild Bull\u201d with its courtyard and two beer vats and the accompanying curses to those who would use them for their intended purposes. Erishum I\u2019s other civic constructions included the temple of Ishtar and that of Adad. He had exercised eminent domain to clear an area from the Sheep Gate to the People\u2019s Gate to make way for an enlargement of the city wall, so that he could boast that \u201cI made a wall higher than the wall my father had constructed.\u201d His efforts had been recalled by the later kings \u0160am\u0161i-Adad I, in his rebuilding dedication, and \u0160ulmanu-a\u0161ared I, who noted that 159 years had passed between Erishum I\u2019s work and that of Shamsh-Adad I, and a further 580 years until his own when a fire had gutted it. ==Limmu during Erishum I's reign== The following is a list of the annually-elected limmu from the first full year of Erishum I's reign until the year of his death c. 1935 BC (middle chronology): 1974 BC \u0160u-I\u0161tar, son of Abila 1973 BC \u0160ukutum, son of I\u0161uhum 1972 BC Iddin-ilum, son of Kurub-I\u0161tar 1971 BC \u0160u-Anim, son of Isalia 1970 BC Anah-ili, son of Kiki 1969 BC Suitaya, son of Ir'ibum 1968 BC Daya, son of I\u0161uhum 1967 BC Ili-ellat 1966 BC \u0160ama\u0161-t.ab 1965 BC Agusa 1964 BC Idnaya, son of \u0160udaya 1963 BC Quqadum, son of Buzu 1962 BC Puzur-I\u0161tar, son of Bedaki 1961 BC Laqip, son of Bab-idi 1960 BC \u0160u-Laban, son of Kurub-I\u0161tar 1959 BC \u0160u-Belum, son of I\u0161uhum 1958 BC Nab-Suen, son of \u0160u-I\u0161tar 1957 BC Hadaya, son of Elali 1956 BC Ennum-A\u0161\u0161ur, son of Begaya 1955 BC Ikunum, son of \u0160udaya 1954 BC Is.mid-ili, son of Idida 1953 BC Buzutaya, son of I\u0161uhum 1952 BC \u0160u-I\u0161tar, son of Amaya 1951 BC Iddin-A\u0161\u0161ur, son of the priest 1950 BC Puzur-A\u0161\u0161ur, the ghee maker 1949 BC Quqadum, son of Buzu 1948 BC Ibni-Adad, son of Susaya 1947 BC Iri\u0161um, son of Adad-rabi 1946 BC Minanum, son of Begaya 1945 BC Iddin-Suen, son of \u0160alim-ahum 1944 BC Puzur-A\u0161\u0161ur, son of Idnaya 1943 BC \u0160uli, son of Uphakum 1942 BC Laqip, son of Zukua 1941 BC Puzur-I\u0161tar, son of Erisua 1940 BC Aguwa, son of Adad-rabi 1939 BC \u0160u-Suen, son of S.illia 1938 BC Ennum-A\u0161\u0161ur, son of Begaya 1937 BC Enna-Suen, son of Pussanum 1936 BC Ennanum, son of Uphakum 1935 BC Buzi, son of Adad-rabi ==See also== * Timeline of the Assyrian Empire * Old Assyrian Empire * List of Assyrian kings * Assyrian continuity * Assyrian people ==Inscriptions== ==Notes== ==References== Category:20th- century BC Assyrian kings Category:19th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:20th-century BC rulers Category:19th-century BC rulers ",
