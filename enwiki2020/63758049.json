    "text": "A yuga cycle ( Chatur Yuga, Maha Yuga, etc.) is a cyclic age (epoch) in Hindu cosmology, where eternal time repeats general events. Each cycle repeats four yugas (dharmic ages) - Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga -, lasting for 4,320,000 years, or 12,000 divine years. Dharma is personified as a bull, whose four legs reduce by one with each new yuga, often related to Mother Earth, personified as a cow. As the cycle progresses, each yuga's length, and humanity's general moral and physical state, decreases by 1/4th. Near the end of Kali Yuga, when virtues are at their worst, a cataclysm and re-establishment of dharma occurs to usher in the next cycle's Satya Yuga, prophesied to occur by Kalki. Kali Yuga, which lasts for 432,000 years, is believed to have started in 3102 BCE. There are 1,000 cycles in a kalpa (a Brahma's day), which is followed by a night - or pralaya (dissolution) -, of equal length. During a pralaya, everything created by Brahma is unmanifest, including himself, until he was reborn, in his next day, starting the yuga cycles again. ==Lexicology== A yuga cycle has several names, where \"yuga\" is sometimes written in its archaic form of \"yug\". Yuga () : sometimes used to describe a \"'\". C(h)atur Yuga () : a cyclic age, encompassing the four yuga ages, as defined in hindu texts. Daiva Yuga (), Deva Yuga (), Divya Yuga () : a cyclic age of the divine, celestrial, or gods (devas), encompassing the four yuga ages ( \"human ages\", or \"world ages\"). The hindu texts give the length in divine years (12,000), which lasts for 1/3rd of the lifespan of the devas (36,000). Maha Yuga () : a greater cyclic age, encompassing the four smaller yuga ages. Yuga Cycle () + () : a cyclic age, encompassing the four yuga ages. ==Sources== It is theorized that the concept of the four yugas, originated a few time after the compilation of the Vedas, but before the rest of the Hindu texts for its bases, isn't mentioned in the four Vedas. It is believed that the four yugas \u2060\u2014 Krita (Satya), Treta, Dvapara, and Kali\u2060 \u2014 are named after throws of an Indian game of long dice, marked with 4-3-2-1, respectively They are in order K\u1e5bta, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para, and Kali, and correspond roughly to the Gold, Silver, Brass and Iron Ages of the classics. The Sanskrit names are called after the sides of a die in descending order of their value in play. Thus K\u1e5bta is the side with four dots, while Kali, being the side with only one dot, is always a certain loser. The connection between dice and the different eras of the world is perhaps not at first evident. It is well explained by H. Jacobi in \u201cAges of the World,\u201d Hastings\u2019 Ency. Rel. Eth., vol. i, p. 200 et. seq. The Rig-Veda, which we may reasonably consider to have been in its present form before 1000 B.C., has references to the use of dice, and one of its hymns (Book 10, 34) is a charm to cure an inveterate and unsuccessful gambler of the compulsion to gamble that has ruined him. In the Atharva Veda, also, gambling with dice is mentioned (2.3; 4.38; 6.118; 7.52; 7.109). The Aryans of Rig- Vedic times made their dice of the vibhidaka-tree nuts, and we do not know how they used them.. A dice game is mentioned in the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Upanishads, Puranas, Ramayana, and Mahabharata, while the four yugas are mentioned after the Vedas, but with no mention of being related to a dice game. A complete description of the four yugas and their characteristics are found in the Vishnu Smriti, Mahabharata (e.g. Vanaparva 149, 183), Manusmriti (I.81-86), and Puranas (e.g. Brahma, ch. 122-123 ; Matsya, ch. 142-143 ; Naradiya, Purvardha, ch. 41). Also found in Bhagavata Purana (3.11.18-20). ===Manusmriti=== In the Manusmriti ( Laws of Manu), divisions of time are described from a moment up to Brahma's days and nights (1.61\u201386), which includes the length of a \"\" (1.71) and its four yugas (1.69-70). Included is a method to convert a day/night of the gods ( 360-day years) to human (solar) years (1.67). This composition indicates that the four yugas were named by some previous persons, which William Jones translated as Sages (1.69). According to Patrick Olivelle, most scholars take the table of contents (1.111\u2013118) to be an addition, but for him, the account of time and cosmology (1.61\u201386) to the aforementioned (1.118) are out of place redactions. He feels the narrative should have ended when the initial command to \"listen\" (1.4) was repeated (1.60), then transition to \"learn\" (2.1). Georg B\u00fchler, whose translation has remained the standard for over a century, according to Olivelle, translated 1.71 as 12,000 years in a four-aged period, same as Jones's translation, both based on the commentary of Kulluka Bhatta. Medhatithi translated it as 12,000 four-aged periods in an age of the gods. Kulluka and Olivelle reject Medhatithi's interpretation, based on 1.79 mentioning 12,000 without a qualifier (\"etat\" or \"this\"), and must be assumed as years. ===Surya Siddhanta=== A caturyuga and its four ages (k\u1e5bta is named) are found in the Surya Siddhanta. pp. 152-153 ===European culture=== The earliest European writing about human ages is in Works and Days (700BCE) by Hesiod; although, not cyclic and with a fifth \"Heroic age\" added, according to Joscelyn Godwin, as a compromise with the Trojan War in Greek history. The \"Four Ages\" are also found in Metamorphoses (8BCE) by Ovid. Godwin says that it is probably from Hindu tradition that knowledge of the ages reached the Greeks and other Indo-European peoples. Godwin points out that the exact length of Kali Yuga (432,000 years) shows up in Chaldean, Chinese and Icelandic cultures and is the number of syllables in the Rigveda. ==The cycle== One cycle contains four ages in the following order: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. As it progresses, each yuga's length, and humanity's general moral and physical state, decreases by 1/4th (25%), giving proportions of 4:3:2:1 (e.g. Satya: 100% start; Kali: 25% start, 0% end). Each yuga is divided into a main period (sometimes called the Yuga) and two Sandhis or (connecting periods)\u2060\u2014 (dawn) and or (dusk)\u2060\u2014where each Sandhi lasts for 1/10th (10%) of the main period. Lengths are given in divine or celestial years, where a divine year lasts for 360 solar (human) years. A Yuga Cycle lasts for 4,320,000 solar (12,000 divine) years: * Satya Yuga (4x): 1,728,000 (4,800 divine) years ** Main: 1,440,000 (4,000 divine) ** Sandhis: 144,000 (400 divine) x 2 * Treta Yuga (3x): 1,296,000 (3,600 divine) years ** Main: 1,080,000 (3,000 divine) ** Sandhis: 108,000 (300 divine) x 2 * Dvapara Yuga (2x): 864,000 (2,400 divine) years ** Main: 720,000 (2,000 divine) ** Sandhis: 72,000 (200 divine) x 2 * Kali Yuga (1x): 432,000 (1,200 divine) years ** Main: 360,000 (1,000 divine) ** Sandhis: 36,000 (100 divine) x 2 According to Puranic sources, Krishna's departure marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102BCE.

There are 1,000 Maha Yugas (4,320,000,000 years) in a kalpa (Brahma's day), the creator of planets and first living entities. There are 14 Manvantaras (4,294,080,000 years) in a kalpa, with a remainder of 25,920,000 years assigned to 15 Sandhyas (junctures), each the length of a Satya Yuga (1,728,000 years). A kalpa is followed by a night, or Pralaya (partial dissolution), of equal length, forming a full day. A Maha Kalpa (Brahma's life) lasts for his 100 360-day years or 72,000,000 Maha Yugas (311.04 trillion years), which is followed by a Maha Pralaya (full dissolution) of equal length. We are currently halfway through Brahma's life (mah\u0101-kalpa): (See Hindu units of time). * 51st year of 100 (2nd half or par\u0101rdha) * 1st month of 12 * 1st kalpa (Shveta-Varaha) of 30 * 7th manvantara (Vaivasvatha) of 14 * 28th mah\u0101-yuga of 71 * 4th yuga (Kali) of 4 ==Yuga dates== Yuga dates are used in an ashloka, which is read out at the beginning of Hindu rites to specify the elapsed time in Brahma's life: According to P. V. Kane, one of the earliest inscriptions with one of the four yugas named is the Pikira grant of Pallava Simhavarman:The Pikira grant inscription has the word \"kaliyuga\" on line 10 located on 3rd plate, first side. \u2060\u2014 Other Epigraphs exist with named yugas in the Old Mysore region of India, published in Epigraphia Carnatica.Each term has an index of volumes: * p. 177: Dvapara, Yuga or age; Dvapara-yuga, do. * p. 301: Kali-yuga, age of Kali * p. 364: Kritayuga, age; Kritayuga, do. \u2014 ==Yuga avatars== ===Vishnu=== The Puranas describe Vishnu avatars that come during specific yugas, but may not occur in every Yuga Cycle. Vamana appears at the beginning of Treta Yuga. According to Vayu Purana, Vamana's 3rd appearance was in the 7th Treta Yuga.Part 1: 50.41 (city of Bali), 55.3, 55.7. Part 2: 5.133, 35.73, 35.77, 36.74-85, 37.26-32, 38.21-22, 46.29 (Bali as oblation). Rama appears at the end of Treta Yuga. According to Vayu Purana and Matsya Purana, Rama appeared in the 24th Yuga Cycle. According to Padma Purana, Rama also appeared in the 27th Yuga Cycle of the 6th Manvantara. ===Ganesha=== Ganesha avatars are described as coming during specific yugas.Brief summaries of events in each incarnation are given in John A. Grimes. Ganapati: Song of the Self. pp. 100\u2013105. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) Ganesha Purana I.46.28 in the 1993 Sharma edition. In the version used by Bh\u0101skarar\u0101ya in his Khadyota commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama the verse is numbered I.46.33 and the name is given as Ka\u015byapasuta.Yuvraj Krishan, op. cit. p. 84, footnote 13, says that in the Ganesha Purana 2.131.32, Dh\u016bmraketu is said to have four arms but in ibid. 2.1.21 and 2.85.15 he is said to have only two arms. The version given in Grimes mentions only two arms. ===Vyasa=== Vyasa is attributed as the compiler of the four Vedas, Mahabharata and Puranas. According to the Vishnu Purana, Kurma Purana and Shiva Purana, a different Vyasa comes at the end of each Dvapara Yuga to write down Veda (knowledge) for the degraded age of Kali Yuga.Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas, Volume 1 (2001), page 1408H.

The Vishnu Purana sacred-texts.com,Retrieved 2015-02-14 ==Modern theories== Breaking from the long duration of a Yuga Cycle, new theories have emerged regarding the length, number and order of the yugas. ===Sri Yukteswar Giri=== Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri (1855 \u2013 1936), in the introduction of his book, The Holy Science (1894), proposed a Yuga Cycle of 24,000 years. He claimed the understanding that Kali Yuga lasts for 432,000 years was a mistake, which he traced back to Raja Parikshit, just after the descending Dvapara Yuga ended ( 3101BCE) and all the wise men of his court retired to the Himalaya Mountains. With no one left to correctly calculate the ages, Kali Yuga never officially started. After 499CE, in ascending Dvapara Yuga, when the intellect of men began to develop, but not fully, they noticed mistakes and attempted to correct them by converting what they thought to be divine years to human years (1:360 ratio). Yukteswar's yuga lengths for Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali are respectively 4,800, 3,600, 2,400 and 1,200 \"human\" years (12,000 years total). He accepted the four yugas and their 4:3:2:1 length and dharma proportions, but his Yuga Cycle contained eight yugas, the original descending set of the four yugas followed by an ascending (reversed) set, where he called each set a \"Daiva Yuga\" or \"Electric Couple\". His Yuga Cycle lasts for 24,000 years, which he believed equals one precession of the equinoxes (traditionally 25,920 years) [difference of 1,920 years ignored]. He states that the world entered the Pisces-Virgo Age in 499CE (\"cycle bottom\"), and that the current age of ascending Dvapara Yuga started in 1699CE, around the time of scientific discoveries and advancements such as electricity. He explained that in a 24,000-year Yuga Cycle, our Sun completes one orbit around some dual star, becoming nearer and farther to a galactic center, which the pair orbit in a longer period. He called this galactic center Vishnunabhi (Vishnu's Navel), where Brahma regulates dharma or, as he defined it, mental virtue. Dharma is lowest when farthest from Brahma at the descending-ascending intersection (\"cycle-bottom\"), where the opposite occurs at the \"cycle-top\" when nearest. At dharma's lowest (499CE), human intellect cannot comprehend anything beyond the gross material world. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-width: 0px; text- align: right;\" |+ style=\"font-size: 120%;\" | Yukteswar's yuga cycle ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Yuga ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align: center;\" | Start ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Length |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 5px; text-align: left;\" | Descending (12,000 years): |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align: left;\" | Satya | 11,501BCE | 4,800 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Treta | 6701BCE | 3,600 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Dvapara | 3101BCE | 2,400 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Kali | 701BCE | 1,200 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 5px; text-align: left;\" | Ascending (12,000 years): |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Kali | 499CE | 1,200 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Dvapara* | 1699CE | 2,400 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Treta | 4099CE | 3,600 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Satya | 7699CE12,499CE | 4,800 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 5px; text-align: right;\" | Years: 24,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; font-size: 80%; font-weight: normal; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left;\" | | style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; padding-top: 0px;\" | |} Joscelyn Godwin states that Yukteswar believed the traditional chronology of the yugas wrong and rigged for political reasons, but that Yukteswar may have had political reasons of his own, evident in a police report printed in Atlantis and the Cycles of Time, which links Yukteswar to a secret anti-colonial movement called Yugantar, meaning \"new age\" or \"transition of an epoch\". Godwin claims the Jain time cycle and the \"European myth of progress\" influenced Yukteswar, who's theory only recently became prominent outside India in this millennium. Humanity in an upward cycle is contrary to traditional ideas. Godwin points out many philosophies and religions that started during a time when \"man could not see beyond the gross material world\" (701BCE1699CE). Only materialists and atheists would welcome the post-1700 age as an improvement. John Major Jenkins, who adjusted ascending Kali Yuga from 499CE to 2012 in his version, criticizes Yukteswar as wanting the \"cycle-bottom\" to correspond to his education, beliefs, and historical understanding. Technology has thrust us deeper into material dependency and spiritual darkness. ===Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non=== Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non (1886 \u2013 1951), in his original 1931 French article which was later translated in the book, Traditional Forms & Cosmic Cycles (2001), proposed a Yuga Cycle of 64,800 years. Gu\u00e9non accepted the doctrine of the four yugas, the 4:3:2:1 yuga length proportions, and Kali Yuga as the present age. He couldn't accept the extremely large lengths and felt they were encoded with additional zeros to mislead those who might use it to predict the future. He reduced a Yuga Cycle from 4,320,000 to 4,320 years (1,728 + 1,296 + 864 + 432), but he felt this was too short for humanity's history. In looking for a multiplier, he worked backwards from the precession of the equinoxes (traditionally 25,920 years; 360 72-year degrees). Using 25,920 and 72, he calculated the sub-multiplier to be 4,320 years (72 x 60 = 4,320; 4,320 x 6 = 25,920). In noticing the \"great year\" of the Persians (~12,000) and Greeks (~13,000) as almost half the precession, he concluded a \"great year\" must be 12,960 years (4,320 x 3). In trying to find the whole number of \"great years\" in a Manvantara or reign of Vaivasvata Manu, he found the reign of Xisuthros of the Chaldeans to be set to 64,800 years (12,960 x 5), someone he thought to be the same Manu. Gu\u00e9non felt 64,800 years was a more plausible length that may line up with humanity's history. He calculated a 64,800 Manvantara divided into a 4,320 \"encoded\" Yuga Cycle gave a multiplier of 15 (5 \"great years\"). Using 15 as the multiplier, he \"decoded\" a 5-\"great year\" Yuga Cycle as having the following yuga lengths: * Satya: 25,920 (4 ratio or 2 x \"great year\"; 15 x 1,728) * Treta: 19,440 (3 ratio or 1.5 x \"great year\"; 15 x 1,296) * Dvapara: 12,960 (2 ratio or 1 x \"great year\"; 15 x 864) * Kali: 6,480 (1 ratio or 0.5 x \"great year\"; 15 x 432) Gu\u00e9non did not give a start date for Kali Yuga, but instead left clues in his description of the cataclysmic destruction of the Atlantean civilization. His commentator, Jean Robin, in an early 1980s publication, claimed to have decoded this description and calculated that Kali Yuga lasted from 4481BCE to 1999CE (2000CE excluding year 0). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-width: 0px; text-align: right;\" |+ style=\"font-size: 120%;\" | Gu\u00e9non's yuga cycle (Robin) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Yuga ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Start ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Length |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Satya | 62,801BCE | 25,920 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Treta | 36,881BCE | 19,440 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Dvapara | 17,441BCE | 12,960 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Kali | 4481BCE1999CE | 6,480 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 5px; text-align: right;\" | Years: 64,800 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; font-size: 80%; font-weight: normal; padding-top: 0px; text-align: left;\" | | style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; padding-top: 0px;\" | |} ===Alain Dani\u00e9lou=== Alain Dani\u00e9lou (1907 \u2013 1994), in his book, While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind (1985), proposed a Yuga Cycle of 60,487 years. Dani\u00e9lou and Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non had some correspondence where they both couldn't accept the extremely large lengths found in the Puranas. Dani\u00e9lou mostly cited Linga Purana and his calculations are based on a 4,320,000 year Maha Yuga containing (his calculation of 1000 \u00f7 14) 71.42 Manvantaras, each containing 4 yugas [4:3:2:1 proportions]. He pegged 3102BCE as the start of Kali Yuga and placed it after the dawn (Sandhy\u0101). He claimed his dates are accurate to within 50 years, and that the Yuga Cycle started with a great flood and appearance of Cro-Magnon man, and ends with a catastrophe wiping out mankind. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-width: 0px; text-align: right;\" |+ style=\"font-size: 120%;\" | Dani\u00e9lou's yuga cycle ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Yuga ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Start ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align: center;\" | Length |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Satya | 58,042BCE | 24,195 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Treta | 33,848BCE | 18,146 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Dvapara | 15,703BCE | 12,097 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Kali* | 3606BCE2442CE | 6,048.72 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 5px; text-align: right;\" | Years: 60,487 |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; font-size: 80%; font-weight: normal; padding-top: 0px; text- align: left;\" | | style=\"background-color: #ffffff; border-width: 1px 0px 0px 0px; padding-top: 0px;\" | |} Godwin found that Dani\u00e9lou's misunderstanding rests solely on a bad translation of Linga Purana 1.4.7. ==See also== * Ayanamsa * Hindu units of time * List of numbers in Hindu scriptures. * Vedic- Puranic chronology * Hindu eschatology ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Vedic knowledge online, Vedic Time System Category:Hindu astronomy Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Units of time Category:Theories of history Category:Time in Hinduism ",
