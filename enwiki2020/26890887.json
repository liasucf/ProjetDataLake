    "text": "LOL (Laughing Out Loud) is a 2008 French comedy film directed by Lisa Azuelos and starring Sophie Marceau, Christa Theret, and Alexandre Astier. Written by Azuelos and Delgado Nans, the film is about a teenage girl whose life is split between her studies in a Parisian high school, her secret diary, her parents, her friends, and her boyfriends. Christa Theret received a C\u00e9sar Award nomination for Most Promising Actress in 2010. The movie is heavily inspired by La Boum, which starred Marceau as the teenage character. ==Plot== Lola (Christa Theret) is a teenage girl living with her mother Anne (Sophie Marceau), who is divorced from Lola's father, Alain (Alexandre Astier). Nicknamed 'LOL' by her friends, Lola has been taking her first steps into teenage romance, dating a boy from her class named Arthur (F\u00e9lix Moati). Following the summer break, Arthur tells her that he cheated on her over the summer and was dating one of her friends. Lola decides to break things off with him, and starts seeing his close friend, Ma\u00ebl (Jeremy Kapone). Lola's friends seem to enjoy complicating matters even more. But life at home has also become impossible with her mother, Anne (Sophie Marceau). Lola attempts to play her mother and her father Alain (Alexandre Astier) off against each other for her own advantage, but what she doesn't know is that Anne and Alain have begun dating again on the sly. After a class trip to England, her relationship with her mother comes crashing down. ==Cast== * Sophie Marceau as Anne * Christa Theret as Lola * Alexandre Astier as Alain * J\u00e9r\u00e9my Kapone as Ma\u00ebl * Marion Chabassol as Charlotte * Lou Lesage as St\u00e9phane * \u00c9mile Bertherat as Paul-Henri * F\u00e9lix Moati as Arthur * Louis Sommer as Mehdi * Ad\u00e8le Choubard as Provence * Jade-Rose Parker as Isabelle de Peyrefitte * Warren Guetta as David L\u00e9vy * Jocelyn Quivrin as Lucas * Fran\u00e7oise Fabian as Anne's mother * Christiane Millet as Charlotte's mother * Lise Lam\u00e9trie as The CPE * Tha\u00efs Alessandrin as Louise * Tom Invernizzi as Th\u00e9o * St\u00e9phanie Murat as Cathy * Laurent Bateau as Romain * Val\u00e9rie Karsenti as Laurence * Pierre Niney as Julien * Jean-Claude Dauphin as The minister * Olivier Cruveiller as Ma\u00ebl's father * Katia Caballero as Ma\u00ebl's mother * Vincent Jasinskij as L\u00e9on * Patty Hannock as Madame Claude, the English teacher * Virginie Lente as Lili * Lisa Azuelos as The psychanalyst ==Critical response== A cultural critic writing for The Independent noted that the film portrayed British culture in the way it is stereotypically imagined by many French, showing a small town outside London where it \"never stops raining. The streets are populated by middle-aged women in dowdy floral dresses carrying garish umbrellas. For dinner, the French teenagers are served white bread, marmalade and pasta \u2013 on the same plate.\" In France the film was well received as depicting a generation of youngsters, much as other films in the 1980s and 1990s had. ==Remake== An American remake released on 4 May 2012 starring Miley Cyrus, Demi Moore, Ashley Greene, Adam Sevani, and Douglas Booth was a critical and commercial failure. ==References== ==External links== * * LOL (Laughing Out Loud) at uniFrance Category:2000s high school films Category:2000s teen comedy films Category:2008 films Category:Films directed by Lisa Azuelos Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in Paris Category:French teen comedy films Category:French films Category:French high school films ",
