    "text": "In sociology and organizational studies, institutional theory is a theory on the deeper and more resilient aspects of social structure. It considers the processes by which structures, including schemes, rules, norms, and routines, become established as authoritative guidelines for social behavior.Scott, W. Richard 2004. \u201cInstitutional theory.\u201d in Encyclopedia of Social Theory, George Ritzer, ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Pp. 408-14 Different components of institutional theory explain how these elements are created, diffused, adopted, and adapted over space and time; and how they fall into decline and disuse. == Overview == In defining institutions, accordings to William Richard Scott (1995, 235), there is \"no single and universally agreed definition of an 'institution' in the institutional school of thought.\" Scott (1995:33, 2001:48) asserts that: According to Scott (2008), institutional theory is \"a widely accepted theoretical posture that emphasizes rational myths, isomorphism, and legitimacy.\"Scott, W. Richard (2008) Institutions and Organizations: Ideas and Interests. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publications. Researchers building on this perspective emphasize that a key insight of institutional theory is imitation: rather than necessarily optimizing their decisions, practices, and structures, organizations look to their peers for cues to appropriate behavior. According to Kraft's Public Policy (2007):Kraft's Public Policy: Kraft, Micahel E & Furlong, Scott R Public Policy: politics, analysis, and alternatives (2nd ed). CQ; London : Eurospan [distributor], Washington, D.C, 2007. Institutional Theory is \"Policy-making that emphasizes the formal and legal aspects of government structures.\" == Schools of institutional theory == There are two dominant trends in institutional theory: * Old institutionalism * New institutionalism Powell and DiMaggio (1991)DiMaggio, Paul J. and Powell, Walter W. (1991)\u2018Introduction\u2019. In P. J. DiMaggio and W. Powell (eds.) \u2018The New Institutionalism and Organizational Analysis\u2019, pp. 1\u201338. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. define an emerging perspective in sociology and organizational studies, which they term the 'new institutionalism', as rejecting the rational-actor models of Classical economics. Instead, it seeks cognitive and cultural explanations of social and organizational phenomena by considering the properties of supra- individual units of analysis that cannot be reduced to aggregations or direct consequences of individuals\u2019 attributes or motives. Scott (1995)Scott, W. Richard 1995. Institutions and Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. indicates that, in order to survive, organisations must conform to the rules and belief systems prevailing in the environment (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;DiMaggio, Paul J., and Walter W. Powell 1983. \u201cThe iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields,\u201d American Sociological Review 48:147-60. Meyer and Rowan, 1977Meyer, John W. and Rowan, Brian (1977) \u2018Institutionalized organizations: Formal structure as myth and ceremony\u2019. American journal of sociology 83: 340\u2013363.), because institutional isomorphism, both structural and procedural, will earn the organisation legitimacy (Dacin, 1997; Deephouse, 1996; Suchman, 1995Suchman, Mark C. 1995. \u201cLocalism and globalism in institutional analysis: The emergence of contractual norms in venture finance.\u201d In The Institutional Construction of Organizations: International and Longitudinal Studies, 39-63, W. Richard Scott, and S\u00f8ren Christensen, ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.). For instance, multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in different countries with varying institutional environments will face diverse pressures. Some of those pressures in host and home institutional environments are testified to exert fundamental influences on competitive strategy (Martinsons, 1993; Porter, 1990) and human resource management (HRM) practices (Rosenzweig and Singh, 1991;Rosenzweig, P . and J. Singh. 1991. Organizational environments and the multinational enterprise. Academy of Management Review,16(2):340-361 Zaheer, 1995). Corporations also face institutional pressures from their most important peers: peers in their industry and peers in their local (headquarters) community; for example, Marquis and Tilcsik (2016) show that corporate philanthropic donations are largely driven by isomorphic pressures that companies experience from their industry peers and local peers. Non- governmental organisations (NGOs) and social organizations can also be susceptible to isomorphic pressures. More recent work in the field of institutional theory has led to the emergence of new concepts such as \\- institutional logics, a concept pioneered by Friedland & Alford (1991) and later by Thornton, Ocasio & Lounsbury (2012). The institutional logic perspective mostly take a structural and macro approach to institutional analysis \\- institutional work, a concept pioneered by Lawrence & Suddaby, (2006). By contrast with the logic perspective, it gives agentic power to social actors, and assumes those actors can influence institutions - either maintaining or disrupting them. === Challenges in different types of economies === There is substantial evidence that firms in different types of economies react differently to similar challenges (Knetter, 1989). Social, economic, and political factors constitute an institutional structure of a particular environment which provides firms with advantages for engaging in specific types of activities there. Businesses tend to perform more efficiently if they receive the institutional support. ==See also== * Institutional logics * Institutional work * Institutional analysis * Institutional economics ==References== Category:Political science theories ",
