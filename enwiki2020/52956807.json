Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 23, 2019 == Reception == In her review on Allmusic, Judith Schlesinger noted \"This CD was recorded live at the Greenwich Village bar that, for 25 years, showcased the best jazz pianists in the world. The atmosphere was relaxed and intimate, the audience hip and respectful; this collection reflects that history as it reveals three veteran masters at their best. Here are extended explorations of five varied tunes, featuring the elegant fluidity of Kenny Barron's piano, the fat sound and ever-swinging pulse of Ray Drummond's bass, and the superb intricacy of Ben Riley on drums ... This is an excellent CD full of serenely joyful energy, and it reveals new layers of delight with each spin\". In JazzTimes Doug Ramsey wrote \"Barron, bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Ben Riley stretch out in performances of five pieces captured with admirable fidelity by engineer Jim Anderson\".Ramsey, D. JazzTimes Review, accessed January 24, 2016 On All About Jazz Samuel Chell said \"Kenny Barron has never sounded better to me on record. After listening to him in this setting, I'm beginning to understand why so many musicians lamented the passing of Bradley's, the Manhattan night spot that featured a grand piano handpicked and donated by Paul Desmond\".Chell, S.
