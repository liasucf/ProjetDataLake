Understanding the seventeenth-century use of the term \u2018philosophy\u2019 in its broadest sense, this dictionary is an encyclopaedia of Early Modern thought encompassing intellectual traditions from scholastic philosophy to literature, poetry, politics, art and science. This Dictionary demonstrates the ways in which the lives and works of even minor writers can reveal hitherto unsuspected connections between currants of thought, theories of knowledge, and religious and political allegiances Published in London and New York in December 2008, the Dictionary is part of an international intellectual project to cover these themes on a country-by-country basis, from the seventeenth to the twentieth centurieshttp://www.bloomsbury.com/us/search?q=Dictionary+of+seventeenth- century+french+philosophers&Gid;=1 This innovative method of studying philosophy is unique in privileging relatively unknown authors, an approach which is continued in the French edition: Dictionnaire des philosophes fran\u00e7ais du XVIIe si\u00e8cle : acteurs et r\u00e9seaux du savoir. These volumes have enlarged the field of study, with 108 supplementary entries and eight thematic introductions which, following the preface by Luc Foisneau, suggest other possible intellectual routes : \u2018The French Cartesians\u2019 (Emmanuel Faye) ; \u2018Scholastic philosophies and theologies\u2019 (Jacob Schmutz) ; \u2018 \"Libertines\" and free thinking\u2019 (Isabelle Moreau) ; \u2018Clandestine thought\u2019 (Gianni Paganini) ; \u2018The sciences\u2019 (Philippe Hamou) ; \u2018Theories of Art\u2019 (Carole Talon-Hugon) ; \u2018Religious controversies and the birth of the Republic of letters (Antony McKenna) ; \u2018Philosophical places, sociabilities and practices\u2019 (St\u00e9phane Van Damme) https://philosophypress.co.uk/?s=dictionary+french+philosophers The French version further provides a historical index of more than 300 pages, providing biographical and bibliographical information.
