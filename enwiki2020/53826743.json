    "text": "Aldrick Rosas (born December 30, 1994) is an American football placekicker for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 2018 NFL season as a member of the New York Giants. == College career == Rosas played college football at Southern Oregon University of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In 2014, he tore the ACL in his kicking leg making a tackle in the NAIA Championship Game. After missing the 2015 season, he decided to forego the remainder of college eligibility to pursue a career in the NFL. ==Professional career== ===Tennessee Titans=== Following the conclusion of the 2016 NFL Draft, Rosas signed with the Tennessee Titans as an undrafted free agent on May 9, 2016. On September 2, 2016, Rosas was waived by the Titans. ===New York Giants=== ==== 2017 season ==== On January 19, 2017, Rosas signed a reserve/future contract with the New York Giants. Rosas was the only kicker on the Giants roster after former Giants' placekicker Robbie Gould agreed to a two-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers, until veteran Mike Nugent signed a contract with the team on August 1, 2017. Rosas ultimately won the starting kicker job after Nugent was released during final roster cuts. On September 10, 2017, in the Giants' season-opening 19\u20133 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Rosas converted his first NFL career field goal, a 25-yard attempt, in the third quarter. Prior to the game, he watched his girlfriend give birth via FaceTime. Rosas finished the season with a 72% field goal conversion rate (31st in the league) and an 87% PAT conversion rate (last in the league). ==== 2018 season ==== Rosas retained his starting job with the Giants for the 2018 season. He vastly improved on his rookie season, becoming a Pro Bowl selection, converting 32 of 33 field goal attempts and 31 of 32 PATs, with his only missed PAT was due to a poor snap. He was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his Week 13 performance against the Chicago Bears where he converted three field goals, including a New York Giants franchise record 57-yarder and the game-winning 44-yard field goal in overtime. On December 18, 2018, Rosas was named to his first Pro Bowl, and on January 4, 2019, Rosas was named a Second Team All-Pro for 2018. ==== 2019 season ==== The Giants re- signed Rosas as an exclusive-rights free agent on March 7, 2019. The Giants placed a second-round tender on Rosas on March 16, 2020, and signed it on April 8, 2020. On July 15, 2020, Rosas was formally charged with three misdemeanors in the Superior Court of California for an alleged high-speed hit-and-run that led to his arrest on June 16. Rosas was released by the Giants on July 27, 2020. He pleaded no contest to the charges on September 23, 2020, and was sentenced to three years of probation. ===Jacksonville Jaguars=== On September 28, 2020, Rosas was signed to the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad. Rosas made four field goals in his first game as a Jaguar, replacing the inactive Stephen Hauschka. == Career statistics == === Regular season === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! rowspan=\"2\" |Year ! rowspan=\"2\" |Team ! rowspan=\"2\" |Games ! colspan=\"8\" |Field Goals ! colspan=\"3\" |Extra Point ! rowspan=\"2\" |Total Points |- !Made !Att !Pct !20-29 !30-39 !40-49 !50+ !Lng !Made !Att !Pct |- |2017 |NYG |16 |18 |25 |72.0 |8/8 |3/5 |4/9 |3/3 |52 |20 |23 |87.0 |74 |- |2018 |NYG |16 |32 |33 |97.0 |9/9 |13/13 |6/6 |4/5 |57 |31 |32 |96.9 |127 |- |2019 |NYG |16 |12 |17 |70.6 |6/6 |5/6 |1/4 |0/1 |45 |35 |39 |89.7 |71 |- | colspan=\"15\"|Stats accurate as of 2018 Week 17.
