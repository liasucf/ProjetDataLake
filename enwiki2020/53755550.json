The helicopter was carrying two pilots, one Turkish businessman of Eczacibasi group and four Russian guests of the company for a meeting at Bozuyuk facilities scheduled at noon. The aircraft was a Sikorsky S-76C++, with tail number TC-HEZ, manufactured in 2008. Aviation Safety Network ==Crash== The helicopter had departed Istanbul- Atat\u00fcrk Airport at 11:15 local time in heavy fog. Six minutes after the takeoff, it hit the Endem TV Tower and crashed onto the nearby State Road D100 highway. All seven people on board were killed. ==Investigation== Directorate General of Civil Aviation informed the press that investigation is still ongoing, but poor visibility conditions and the heavy fog was probably the main cause of the accident. Although, it was not clear why the pilots were flying near the tower since it is clearly stated on maps as \"no-fly\" zone and most experienced pilots were already aware of the height and location of the tower.
