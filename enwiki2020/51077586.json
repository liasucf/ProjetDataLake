She is aworshipper of nature, and she fits the moods of the great earth-mother to her own thoughts \u2014 and they are sad ones.\"\"Literature\", The Queenslander, 22 June 1901, p1190 A short review in The Australian Town and Country Journal stated that the poems \"amply demonstrate the possession by her of true poetic feeling... Many of these verses possess that ring only to be found in such as are evidently part of a writer's life, and therefore approach most closely the art-in-itself.\"\"Dreams in Flower\" The Australian Town and Country Journal, 29 June 1901, p19 ==See also== * The full text of the collection is available from the Harvard University LibraryDreams in Flower by Louise Mack, full text * 1901 in poetry * 1901 in Australian literature ==References== Category:Australian poetry collections Category:1901 poetry books ",
