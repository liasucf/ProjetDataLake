    "text": "Ocrasa is a genus of moths belonging to the family Pyralidae. The genus is mostly treated as a synonym of Hypsopygia. If considered valid, the genus includes many species which were formerly included in Herculia.See references in Savela (2009) In addition, the proposed genus Orthopygia, which some authors consider a separate (and sometimes monotypic) lineage is here merged with Ocrasa. The latter two genera are also mostly merged with Hypsopygia however. ==Selected species== * Ocrasa acerasta * Ocrasa albidalis Walker, [1866] * Ocrasa chytriodes (Turner, 1911) * Ocrasa decoloralis (Lederer, 1863) * Ocrasa fulvocilialis - sometimes still in Herculia * Ocrasa glaucinalis - sometimes in Orthopygia * Ocrasa nannodes - sometimes in Orthopygia * Ocrasa nostralis (Guen\u00e9e, 1854) * Ocrasa placens - sometimes in Orthopygia * Ocrasa repetita (Butler, 1887) * Ocrasa tripartialis (Herrich-Sch\u00e4ffer, 1871) ==Footnotes== ==References== * (2009): Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms - Ocrasa.
