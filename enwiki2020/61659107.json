The most important part of the fortification process took place between 1498 and 1540, reinforcing the old middle age wall. After the revolt of the Comuneros, the troops of Francis I of France led by general Asparrot sieged the city on May 25, 1521 being responsible of its defense captain V\u00e9lez de Guevara. But the construction of the wall and the gate which are visible today started in 1522, Page 7 one year after the siege. After the second half of the 16th century, its role in the city defense started to decline, which resulted in a noticeable deterioration of the walls. Private buildings were built against its walls, which did not prevent its conservation to our days. == Celebration of San Bernab\u00e9 == During the fiestas of San Bernab\u00e9 the Fish brotherhood offers the citizens a serving of fish, remembering the siege Logro\u00f1o was under by the french-navarre army in the year 1521 and which the inhabitants endured feeding on fishes coming from the Ebro river. == External links == * Historia de las fortificaciones de Logro\u00f1o Lariojatierraabierta.com == References == Category:Logro\u00f1o ",
