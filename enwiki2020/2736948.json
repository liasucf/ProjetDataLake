    "text": "Kangiryuarmiutun (sometimes Kangirjuarmiut(un)), is a dialect of Inuit language spoken in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada by the Kangiryuarmiut, a Copper Inuit people. The dialect is part of the Inuvialuktun language. The people of Ulukhaktok prefer to think of it as Inuinnaqtun and it is essentially the same. It is derived from Kangiryuak (meaning \"the big bay\"), and named for the people that lived there, the Kangiryuarmiut, which is known by its English name Prince Albert Sound, Victoria Island. Victoria Island is the ancestral home of the Copper Inuit. == Vocabulary comparison == The comparison of some animal names in the Siglitun and Kangiryuarmiutun subdialects of the Inuinnaqtun dialect of Inuvialuktun:Olokhaktomiut Community Conservation Plan, July 2008 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
