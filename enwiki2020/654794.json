He wrote and executive-produced Chasing Holden, distributed by Lionsgate, which starred DJ Qualls. In November 2000, he joined the cast of the CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful as Deacon Sharpe, playing a character that was originally conceived as a short- term villain. In 2002, rumors surfaced that the actor had been fired, but he remained with the show until early 2005 when he opted to go on a recurring status, and he last appeared February 22, 2005. Upon his departure from The Bold and the Beautiful, Kanan starred in several feature films and competed in the third season of the Italian version of Dancing with the Stars in 2006.

Quartermaine on General Hospital after a 15-year absence. The actor was excited to work with new leadership, Frank Valentini .

Upon being rehired, Kanan noted that Deacon is his favorite of all the characters he has played due to the writing of Bradley Bell.

The episodes, penned by Michele Kanan and Lauren de Normandie, explore issues like #meToo sexual harassment, ageism, gender identity and surprise paternity with enough levity to keep the story moving. Studio City was truly a family affair, with Kanan's Emmy-nominated wife Michele Kanan writing / producing and their daughter Juliet Vega starring as Sam's surprise love child. Studio City is streaming on Amazon Prime. ===The Karate Kid Part III=== As a teenager, years prior to his role in The Karate Kid Part III, Kanan trained in boxing before switching to Shotokan Karate and kickboxing at age 13.[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/seankanan/html/biography.html Sean Kana profile ; accessed February 6, 2010.
