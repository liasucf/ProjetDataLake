He collected specimens for other naturalists; for instance, George Busk, who in 1859 wrote \"Zoophytology: On some Madeiran Polyzoa.\" Collected by J. Yates Johnson, Esq. in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, vol. 7, pp. 65\u201367. He discovered and named Halargyreus johnsonii and Melanocetus johnsonii during his time in Madeira. Johnson explored the S\u00e3o Vicente Caves after being informed of their existence by locals on Madeira in 1885. The caves were opened to the public on 1 October 1996, being one of the first caves of volcanic origins to be opened to the public in Portugal.
