    "text": "Le Race is a road bicycle racing event held annually in Canterbury, New Zealand since 1999. The race starts in Christchurch and finishes in Akaroa, and covers a distance of . ==History== Le Race was first held in 1999. In the 2001 event, competitor Vanessa Caldwell died on the Summit Road in the Port Hills when she collided head-on with a car. Race organiser Astrid Anderson was charged with criminal nuisance and convicted in 2003, with a NZ$10,000 fine imposed. The conviction had a major impact on events held on New Zealand roads, with many events cancelled or postponed. The Court of Appeal overturned the conviction in September 2004, as the judge was found to have misdirected the jury. No new trial was ordered, but her conviction was quashed. Anderson's legal costs were NZ$60,000. In 2001, Le Race was one of two events in New Zealand that had a traffic management plan, but this became compulsory following the 2001 fatality. Many club races consequently disappeared, with an underground cycling movement developing of holding unofficial races. Anderson, the original owner of Le Race, sold the event to Simon Hollander in 2008. Hollander passed the event on to Sheree Stevens, whose first event as race director was in 2015. Le Race traditionally started in Christchurch's Cathedral Square in March of each year. The 2011 Christchurch earthquake caused the postponement of Le Race and due to the Central City Red Zone, the 2011 event was held on 15 October and started from Elgin Street in Sydenham. After using Elgin Street as the start for four times, Le Race returned to Cathedral Square for the event held on 21 March 2015. In the 2016 event held on 20 March, a shorter option of just that finished in Little River was also offered. ==Past winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year!!Men's winner!!Women's winner |- | 1999 || Chris Barnsley | Tracy Clark |- | 2000 || Ben Bright | Annalisa Farrell |- | 2001 || Stuart Lowe | Jo Buick |- | 2002 || Heath Blackgrove | Jo Buick |- | 2003 || Mark Bailey | Jo Buick |- | 2004 || Mark Bailey | Michelle Kiesanowski |- | 2005 || Brian Fowler | Annalisa Farrell |- | 2006 || Mark Bailey | Josie Loane |- | 2007 || Edwin Crossling | Carla Ryan |- | 2008 || Jeremy Yates | Serena Sheridan |- | 2009 || Jeremy Yates | Simone Grounds |- | 2010 || Michael Vink | Jo Buick |- | 2011 || Joshua Atkins | Reta Trotman |- | 2012 || Sam Hogan | Reta Trotman |- | 2013 || Michael Vink | Sharlotte Lucas |- | 2014 || Keagan Girdlestone | Reta Trotman |- | 2015 || Daniel Barry | Sharlotte Lucas |- | 2016 || Hayden Roulston | Linda Villumsen |- | 2017 | Brad Evans | Sharlotte Lucas |- | 2018 | Daniel Whitehouse | Ella Harris |- | 2019 | Daniel Whitehouse | Kate McIlroy |} ==References== Category:Cycle races in New Zealand Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in New Zealand Category:Sport in Canterbury, New Zealand Category:Akaroa ",
