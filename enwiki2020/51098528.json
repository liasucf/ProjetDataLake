This apostolic church was the first church built in India and was one of the seven churches established by Saint Thomas in India where he preached and converted locals to Syriac Christianity. The other six churches were built in Kodungalloor, Kokkamangalam, Palayoor, Kollam, Niranam, and Nilackal. In the 9th century, the Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Pilgrim Church was rebuilt by Mar Sabor and Mar Proth who arrived in Malakara from Persia. The Kottakkavu Sliva, a Persian cross engraved on granite stone by Mar Sabor and Mar Proth, is preserved in the chapel in front of the church. The remains found on-site today are those of the third church, which was built in 1308. Pope Gregory XIII raised the altar of this church to the status of privileged altar in 1575. ===List=== Some of the major churches in Taluk include: * Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Pilgrim Church, North Paravur founded A.D. 52 * St. Thomas Church, North Paravur, where the tomb of Mar is to be found. * Mar Sleeva Syro-Malabar Church, Kadalvathuruth, North Paravur * St. Antony's Church, Chettikkad, North Paravur * St. Don Bosco Roman Catholic Latin Church, North Paravur * St. Joseph Cottolengo Roman Catholic Latin Church, North Paravur *St. Antony's syro Malabar church, kochal valluvally. *St George syro Malabar church puthenpally Varapuzha. * * Alengad Kunnel syro Malabar Church, North Paravur * Gothuruth St. Sebastians Latin Church, North Paravur * Kunjithai St. Francis Xavier Church,North Paravur * Malavana St. George's Church, North Paravur * Vyakulambika Matha Church, Pattanam, North Paravur * Ayroor St. Antony's syro Malabar Church, North Paravur * Kuthiathodu St. Francis Xavier Church, North Paravur * Thuruthur St.Thomas Church, North Paravur * Little Flower Catholic Church Koottukad (Latin-Rite), North Paravur * St. Mary's Assumption Church, Ezhikkara, North Paravur * St. Vincent Ferrar Church, Chathanad, North Paravur * St. Germain's Syro-Malabar Church, Kacheripady, North Paravur == Masjids (Mosques)== * Paravur Juma Masjid, North Paravur * W.
