The matches against England were played for the Women's Ashes, which since 2013 consists of a multi-format series with points awarded for each of the matches. Two points are awarded for each Twenty20 International (T20I) or One Day International (ODI) win, and four points to the Test winner (compared with six in the previous series) or two points to each team in the event of a Test draw. The Women's Ashes were held by England before the series but, after winning two ODIs, the Test match and the second T20I, Australia regained the Ashes on 28 August 2015 with one T20I match to play. It was also the first time Australia had won the Ashes in England since 2001, after a draw in 2009 and defeats in the 2005 and 2013 series. Australia won the ODI match series (2\u20131) and the sole Test match. England won the T20I match series (2\u20131). Overall Australia won the Ashes (10 points to 6). Australia's Ellyse Perry scored 264 runs, took 16 wickets and was named the player of the series. The ODI matches were also part of the 2014\u201316 ICC Women's Championship. Apart from their games in England, Australia also defeated Ireland 3\u20130 in a T20I series played in Dublin.Perry, Villani lead Australia to 3-0 at espncricinfo.com, 22 August 2015 ==The Women's Ashes== ===Squads=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- ! colspan=2|ODIs ! colspan=2|Test ! colspan=2|T20Is |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Charlotte Edwards (c) * Heather Knight (vc) * Katherine Brunt * Kate Cross * Georgia Elwiss * Lydia Greenway * Rebecca Grundy * Jenny Gunn * Amy Jones * Laura Marsh * Nat Sciver * Anya Shrubsole * Sarah Taylor (wk) * Lauren Winfield | * Meg Lanning (c) * Alex Blackwell (vc) * Kristen Beams * Nicole Bolton * Jess Cameron * Sarah Coyte * Rene Farrell * Holly Ferling * Alyssa Healy (wk) * Jess Jonassen * Erin Osborne * Ellyse Perry * Megan Schutt * Elyse Villani | * Charlotte Edwards (c) * Heather Knight (vc) * Katherine Brunt * Kate Cross * Georgia Elwiss * Lydia Greenway * Rebecca Grundy * Jenny Gunn * Laura Marsh * Nat Sciver * Anya Shrubsole * Sarah Taylor(wk) * Fran Wilson * Lauren Winfield | * Meg Lanning (c) * Alex Blackwell (vc) * Kristen Beams * Nicole Bolton * Jess Cameron * Sarah Coyte * Rene Farrell * Holly Ferling * Alyssa Healy (wk) * Jess Jonassen * Erin Osborne * Ellyse Perry * Megan Schutt * Elyse Villani | * Charlotte Edwards (c) * Heather Knight (vc) * Katherine Brunt * Georgia Elwiss * Lydia Greenway * Rebecca Grundy * Jenny Gunn * Danielle Hazell * Laura Marsh * Nat Sciver * Anya Shrubsole * Sarah Taylor (wk) * Lauren Winfield * Danielle Wyatt | * Meg Lanning (c) * Alex Blackwell (vc) * Kristen Beams * Nicole Bolton * Jess Cameron * Sarah Coyte * Rene Farrell * Holly Ferling * Alyssa Healy (wk) * Jess Jonassen * ~~Delissa Kimmince~~ 1 * Erin Osborne * Ellyse Perry * Megan Schutt * Elyse Villani * Grace Harris1 |} 1 Delissa Kimmince was Replaced in the T20I squad by Grace Harris as she was unable to recover from a lower back issue. ===ODI series=== ====1st ODI==== ====2nd ODI==== ====3rd ODI==== \\---- ===Test series=== ====Only Test==== ===T20I series=== ====1st T20I==== ====2nd T20I==== ====3rd T20I==== ===Results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | Match ! rowspan=\"2\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" | Result ! colspan=\"2\" | Points won ! colspan=\"2\" | Running total |- !
