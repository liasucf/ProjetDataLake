    "text": "Louis Cachet (born Kristian Vikernes; 11 February 1973), better known as Varg Vikernes (), is a Norwegian musician and writer. In 1991, he founded the one- man music project Burzum, which became one of the most influential black metal acts. In 1994, he was convicted of murder and arson, and subsequently served 15 years in prison. A native of Bergen, Vikernes spent part of his childhood in Iraq, where his father was working for the Iraqi government. He began playing guitar at the age of 14 and formed his first band, Kalashnikov, within the next two years. After founding Burzum he became part of the early Norwegian black metal scene. In 1992, Vikernes, along with other members of the scene, was suspected of burning down four Christian churches in Norway. Vikernes denied responsibility for the arsons, though he supported them. By early 1993, he had recorded four albums as Burzum and another with fellow black metal band Mayhem. In August 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Mayhem guitarist Euronymous during an altercation at the latter's apartment, and was arrested shortly after. In May 1994, Vikernes was convicted of first-degree murder, church arson and possession of explosives. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum penalty under Norwegian law. Vikernes said the killing was self-defense and unsuccessfully argued for the charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. During his incarceration, Vikernes launched the Norwegian Heathen Front, had two books published, and released two ambient albums as Burzum. Vikernes also started a blog which, in the words of a Rolling Stone writer, \"endorsed neo-Nazi views and contains rants against Muslims and Jews\". While Vikernes openly embraced Nazism during the 1990s; he has since disavowed the ideology and its associated movements, although commentators continue to label his views as far-right. He calls his beliefs \"Odalism\" and advocates a \"pre-industrial European pagan society\". Having served 15 years of his sentence, Vikernes was released on parole in early 2009. He changed his legal name to Louis Cachet to avoid difficulties with the public, but still goes by Varg Vikernes in daily life. After his release, he moved to France with his wife and children, where he has continued to write and make music. ==Biography== ===Background and childhood=== In the interviews printed in the 1998 book Lords of Chaos, Vikernes discusses his background and childhood. Lords of Chaos also includes an interview with his mother, Helene Bore (the book and a newspaper depicted there refer to her with the given name Lene, whereas Vikernes' own website uses the name HeleneVarg Vikernes in Childhood. Retrieved 28 March 2013.). In a 2004 interview, Vikernes said his mother was \"working in a large oil company\". His father is an electronics engineer, and his older brother is a civil engineer. In the Lords of Chaos interview, Vikernes recalls that when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to Baghdad, Iraq, because Vikernes' \"father was working for Saddam Hussein\" developing a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became \"aware of racial matters\". Corporal punishment was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion, Vikernes had a \"quarrel\" with a teacher and called him \"a monkey\". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers \"didn't dare to hit me because I was white\". Vikernes' mother also recalls how they \"spent a year in Iraq\" and that \"the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not\". She mentions that this created problems, but generally she \"has no good explanation\" of how Varg developed his views. When asked about his father, Vikernes states that he \"had a swastika flag at home.\" However, Vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about Vikernes \"being a Nazi\", whereas he too was \"pissed about all the colored people he saw in town\". About his mother, Vikernes states that she was \"very race conscious\", in the sense that she was afraid that Vikernes \"was going to come home with a black girl!\" At the time of the 1995 Lords of Chaos interview, Vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but \"very little contact\" with his father. He also stated that his parents are divorced; Vikernes' father is said to have \"left about 10 years ago\", which would have been 1985, when Vikernes was 11 or 12. The Encyclopedia of White Power and historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke have both alleged that Vikernes was part of the neo-Nazi skinhead culture as an adolescent. When asked in the Lords of Chaos interview whether he hung out with skinheads in Bergen, Vikernes said that: \"there were no skinheads in Bergen.\" A fan of classical music as a child, Tchaikovsky in particular, Vikernes started listening to heavy metal at 12, citing Iron Maiden as his biggest inspiration. Later he discovered other metal bands whose sound would be influential on his own band, such as Kreator, Celtic Frost, Bathory, Destruction, Megadeth, Slayer, Pestilence, Deicide and Von. Although Venom are widely considered the primary influence on black metal, Vikernes has always denied to be influenced by them, as well as defining the band as \"a joke\". He once wore a T-shirt of Venom's Black Metal to promote the genre but stated he later regretted doing that. From an early age, Vikernes was also fascinated with the fictional realm of Middle-earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. His stage name, Grishnackh, is taken from that of an orc in The Two Towers, while the band name Burzum, meaning \"darkness,\" was taken from the Black Speech inscribed on the One Ring in The Lord of the Rings. The inscription read \"Ash nazg durbatul\u00fbk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul\u00fbk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul,\" or in English, \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\" Additionally, before joining the Bergen death metal band Old Funeral, he was in a band called Uruk-Hai, which was named for a type of orc from Tolkien's writing. ===Early musical career=== Vikernes started playing guitar at the age of 14. When he was 17, Vikernes came into contact with members of Old Funeral. He played guitar with them during 1990\u20131991 and performed on their Devoured Carcass EP before he began his solo musical project, Burzum, and quickly became involved with the early Norwegian black metal scene. During 1992\u20131993, he recorded four albums as Burzum. Vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old Westone guitar, which he had bought in 1987 from an acquaintance. He used the cheapest bass guitar there was in his local shop and borrowed a drum kit from Old Funeral, the successor band Immortal, and \"another musician living nearby\". On Hvis lyset tar oss, he also borrowed Hellhammer's drum kit, the same one Hellhammer used to record De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas by Mayhem. He used a Peavey amplifier, but for the recording of Filosofem, he used the amplifier on his brother's stereo and some old fuzz pedals. For vocals, he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him, but during the recording of Filosofem, he intentionally used the worst mic they had, a headset mic. On the track \"Dungeons of Darkness\", he used the large gong at Grieghallen for background noise (Euronymous assisted him by beating his fists on it). In 1992, Vikernes joined the black metal band Mayhem, a year after band member Dead committed suicide on 8 April 1991. ===Arson of churches=== The Fantoft Stave Church, restored in 1997. On 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church, dating from the 12th century and considered architecturally significant, was burned to the ground by arson. The cover of Burzum's EP Aske (\"ashes\") is a photograph of the destroyed church. By January 1993, arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major stave churches, including one on Christmas Eve of 1992. Vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases: the arson and attempted arson of \u00c5sane Church and Storetveit Churchin Bergen, the arson of Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and the arson of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the arson of Fantoft Stave Church, although the jurors found him not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case. At the time, media outlets reported that Vikernes was associated with theistic Satanism. In later interviews Vikernes, while not accepting responsibility for the arsons, said that they were not Satanic, but instead \"revenge\" for the Christian desecration of Viking graves and temples. According to Vikernes, the arsons were on the anniversary of the Lindisfarne Viking raid. Vikernes claimed that all the burnings, except for the one at Stavanger, were done by one person. (May have been 1998 edition). ====Bergens Tidende article==== In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende, brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it. In the anonymous interview, \"Count Grishnackh\" (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. BT journalist Finn Bj\u00f8rn T\u00f8nder set up a meeting with Count Grishnackh with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called. There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and said: \"Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to Bergens Tidende.\" They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press, so BT spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details. The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the BT. It was headlined \"We Lit the Fires\" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal, and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. J\u00f8rn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had \"grave consequences\" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as \"he had said nothing\". He added that they became \"bloody angry\" and he, Tunsberg, was \"pissed off\".Torstein Grude: Satan rir media, 1998. Norwegian magazine Rock Furore published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: \"It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence\". He was released in March for lack of evidence. ===Murder of \u00d8ystein Aarseth=== In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes. After the Bergens Tidende episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death at his apartment in Oslo. The murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media. It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records (Euronymous owed Vikernes a large sum of royalty payments), or an attempt at \"outdoing\" a recent stabbing in Lillehammer committed by Emperor drummer Faust.Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music Vikernes claims that he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me\". He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. On the night of the murder, Vikernes and Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at T\u00f8yengata in Oslo. Blackthorn allegedly stood in the stairwell smoking while Vikernes went to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door to hand him the signed contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \"panicked\" and kicked him in the chest. Vikernes claims Euronymous ran into the kitchen to fetch a knife. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found in the stairwell on the first floor with 23 stab wounds\u2014two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Vikernes claims his final stab to the skull was so powerful the knife remained stuck in Euronymous\u2019 skull, but no physical evidence or bodily injuries support his claim.Steinke, Darcey. \"Satan's Cheerleaders\". Spin. February 1996. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. This claim of self-defense is doubted by Emperor drummer Faust, but Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher believes Vikernes killed Euronymous due to the aforementioned death threats he received from him. Blackthorn claims Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. He claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. Blackthorn said of the murder, \"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about \u00d8ystein\". Vikernes, however, claims that he had not planned the killing and that Blackthorn came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs. Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \"defense [...] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\". The Blitz House, which Vikernes allegedly planned to blow up in 1993. Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. The police found 150 kg of explosives and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home. According to the Encyclopedia of White Power, Vikernes \"intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo\", a plan that \"was reportedly on the verge of execution.\" In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to \"destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House,\" and stated \"Vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act.\" Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, saying he was collecting explosives and ammunition \"in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time.\" ====Trial==== Vikernes' trial began on 2 May 1994; he was represented by the lawyer Stein-Erik Mattsson.Sortland, Kjersti, & Bj\u00f8rn Reese. 1997. \"Greven\" oppr\u00f8rt. VG (13 April): 9. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to Lords of Chaos, \"Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he held fast to a code of silence, others confessed.\" During the trial the media made Vikernes \"the nation's first real bogeyman in fifty years\". At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The court alleged that this third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi; to make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. Though Vikernes only confessed to the theft and storage of the explosives, two churches were set on fire the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\". Blackthorn, who hadn't taken part in the murder as he had gone down the condominium's stairs to smoke, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice. May 1994 also saw the release of Mayhem's album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did.\" ===Imprisonment=== Vikernes served his sentence at the prisons in Bergen, T\u00f8nsberg, Ringerike, Trondheim, and Troms\u00f8. According to Swedish scholar Matthias Gardell in his book Gods of the Blood, Vikernes launched the Norwegian Heathen Front (Norsk Hedensk Front) during his early years in prison. Gardell says this was a pagan neo-Nazi group that grew into the international Pan-Germanic Heathen Front (Allgermanische Heidnische Front or AHF). According to Xavier Cattarinich, Vikernes was the \"self-proclaimed leader\" of the Norwegian Heathen Front and Goodrick-Clarke mentions that Vikernes underlined \"his role as chieftain of his Norwegian Heathen Front\" with the writing of Vargsm\u00e5l. The Heathen Front officially denied that Vikernes was in charge. According to the authors of Lord of Chaos, this may have been to protect him, as Norwegian prisoners were prohibited from leading political groups. In addition, the organization's listed address was the same PO box Vikernes used in prison, which the authors state would have made it \"very hard for him [Vikernes] to do an effective job\" at leading the organization, as all letters would have been screened by the prison personnel. Vikernes said \"I have never formed or been a member of such organizations. The only organization I am a member of is Riksm\u00e5lsforbundet\" (The Society for the Preservation of Traditional Standard Norwegian). On 8 April 1997, Norwegian police arrested five neo-Nazis in Hemnes. According to police, the young men were part of a self-styled \"Einsatzgruppe\" and were plotting attacks on political and religious figures in Norway. They also had plans to break Vikernes out of prison. The group \"had all the trappings of a paramilitary unit\", including guns, explosives, bulletproof vests, steel helmets and balaclavas. One of its members, Tom Eiternes, had befriended Vikernes in prison before escaping while on leave. Vikernes' mother, Lene Bore, was arrested for supplying the group with 100,000 kroner. She confessed, but claimed she did not know they were \"right-wing extremists\" and said her son was being attacked by fellow inmates. In late 1996, his jaw had reportedly been broken in a fight with another inmate. However, the prison director said her claims were unfounded, and police suspected that the money came from Vikernes himself. Lords of Chaos says that Vikernes adopted a \"skinhead\" look and wore a belt buckle with SS insignia around this time. Despite her confession, Bore was not convicted, and in 1998 the case against the \"Einsatzgruppe\" was dropped. During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums made up wholly of ambient and neofolk music. The first, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, was recorded in 1994\u20131995 and released in October 1997. The second, Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, was recorded in 1998 and released in April 1999. Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer. In 2000, Vikernes decided to put Burzum on hold. He believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and Satanism. Later, through his website, he indicated that he hoped to continue Burzum after his release from prison, stating: \"I will publish a few books, possibly using a pseudonym in order to stay anonymous, and perhaps a Burzum album or two, but that's it\". In August 2003, Vikernes was transferred from a maximum-security prison in Bergen to the low-security prison in T\u00f8nsberg.\"Newspaper: VARG VIKERNES Carried Military Equipment At The Time Of His Arrest\". Blabbermouth.net. 28 October 2003. Retrieved 4 April 2013. On 15 October, the local paper, T\u00f8nsbergs Blad, published an article that criticised Vikernes.\"UPDATE: VARG Held Family At Gunpoint, Fled Prison Because He Feared Attempt On His Life\". Blabbermouth.net. 27 October 2003. Retrieved 4 April 2013. On 26 October, Vikernes went on the run after being granted a short leave. He stopped a car in Numedal. Inside it was a family of three, who said that he hijacked the car at gunpoint. About 19 hours later, police stopped the car in Romerike and arrested him. The car contained knives, a gas mask, camouflage clothing, a portable GPS navigator, maps, a compass, a laptop and a mobile phone. Police also found a handgun and an AG3 automatic rifle in a cabin in Rollag, where Vikernes had hidden during his escape.\"VARG VIKERNES Refuses To Name Accomplices, Faces Additional Prison Time\". Blabbermouth.net. 30 October 2003. Retrieved 4 April 2013. They concluded that his escape \"was well planned and involved assistance from several people on the outside\". Before the escape, Vikernes gave his mother a letter. In it, he wrote that he had received death threats and another inmate had tried to strangle him shortly after the newspaper article was published. For his actions, thirteen months were added to Vikernes' sentence and he was moved to a prison in Ringerike. In July 2004, he was moved to a maximum-security prison in Trondheim. The last three years of his sentence were spent in Troms\u00f8 Prison. When Vikernes was convicted, it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the Norwegian Parliament had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason. His lawyer, John Christian Elden, has complained that the policy change is a form of retroactive legislation. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Troms\u00f8 Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years.Aftenposten, English edition, 11 June 2008:Too dangerous for parole In March 2009, however, his parole was announced. He had then served nearly 15 years of his 21-year sentence. On 22 May 2009, he confirmed that he had been released from prison on probation.\"Varg Vikernes is a free man\". Blabbermouth.net. 22 May 2009. Retrieved 4 April 2013. ===Life after prison=== Vikernes continued with Burzum after his release. He released a further three black metal albums: Belus (2010), Fallen (2011) and Umskiptar (2012) and a compilation of re-recorded songs (From the Depths of Darkness). On 27 April 2013, Vikernes posted a song on his official YouTube channel, titled \"Back to the Shadows\", which Vikernes has stated to be the last metal track to be released by Burzum.Varg Vikernes: Shadows of the Mind , 30 April 2013. Retrieved 27 June 2013.Back to the Shadows, 27 April 2013. Retrieved 27 June 2013. In May 2013, he released another ambient album, S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan. In July 2012, Vikernes created a YouTube channel under the name ThuleanPerspective (or Thul\u00eaan Perspective). The channel mainly dealt with European pagan mythology and his political views. In 2013, Vikernes and his wife released a film called ForeBears, based on bear worship during the time of the Neanderthals, which is, according to him, connected with autism.\"Inside the Wild World of Varg Vikernes\", Vice, 18 July 2013. Vikernes was one of the recipients of far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik's manifesto, which Breivik sent out before launching the 2011 Norway attacks, killing 77 people. Although Vikernes condemned Breivik's actions, this drew the attention of the French authorities.\"Man linked to Norwegian mass killer Breivik arrested in France\". Reuters. 16 July 2013. On 16 July 2013, Vikernes and his wife, a French national, were arrested at their home in Corr\u00e8ze, France, on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism after his wife bought four rifles. Officials later stated that Vikernes' wife had a legal firearms permit to buy the rifles. The two were later released without charge after police failed to identify any terrorist plans or targets. Vikernes was instead charged by French authorities with inciting racial hatred against Jews and Muslims, which is a criminal offense in France. This was due to posts on his blog, \"Thulean Perspective\", which included anti-Semitic rants that were taken down following the charges. Vikernes claimed he had not written the posts, although the blog attributed all posts to him. On 8 July 2014, Vikernes was convicted of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to six months of probation and a fine of . In June 2018, Vikernes made comments that he had \"moved on\" from Burzum on his YouTube channel, saying \"bye bye\" to the project. Vikernes's YouTube channel was removed from the platform in June 2019. This coincided with an announcement from YouTube that it would be more aggressive in removing extremist content and hate speech that violated its terms of service. Vikernes said he did not know exactly why his channel was removed. Within hours, he had created a new channel and said he would continue to post content. This channel was also removed. In late 2019, Vikernes announced on his Twitter that he intended to release another album as Burzum. Titled Thulean Mysteries, the album was released in March 2020. Vikernes has indicated that this will be his last album under the Burzum name.https://twitter.com/GandalftheWhi19/status/1207258663024562176https://www.plastichead.com/item.aspx?catno=BOBV785LPLTD ==Writing== Vargsm\u00e5l, written by Vikernes in 1994 In late 1994, while in prison, Vikernes wrote a Norwegian-language book called Vargsm\u00e5l (\"Varg's Speech\"). Vikernes has said he wrote Vargsm\u00e5l to defend himself against the media. According to Lords of Chaos, Vargsm\u00e5l became available on the Internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form. In 1997, a Norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book; its publication was financed by Vikernes' mother, Helene Bore. As of 1999, Vargsm\u00e5l was being sold by the neo-Nazi organization Heathen Front via its website. In 1998 he wrote a book called Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse (\"Teutonic Mythology and Worldview\"). In 2011, Abstract Sounds Books published Vikernes' English book entitled Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia, about the religious practices of Scandinavian peoples, particularly during the Stone Age and Bronze Age. According to a review from the music blog Heathen Harvest, the book rejects accepted academic theories, instead focusing on Vikernes's speculation and personalized story-telling. By late 2003, Vikernes had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.Interview with Varg Vikernes for \"Terrorizer\" Magazine (#194, March 2010), by James Minton. Burzum.org. Retrieved 4 April 2013. He also wrote for his personal blog, Thulean Perspective, which was set up in January 2013. The website Ancestral Cult was created by him and his wife. Vikernes has self- published a tabletop role-playing game named MYFAROG. In 2019, he announced plans to release an ambient album of Burzum music, called 'Thulean Mysteries', intended as background music for the game. ==Views== In Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, director Sam Dunn described Vikernes as \"the most notorious metal musician of all time\" due to his crimes as well as his political and religious views. While in prison, Vikernes promoted views which combined Odinism and Esoteric Nazism. Religious studies scholar Egil Asprem characterized Vikernes as \"an idol for skinheads with an inclination towards Paganism and for contemporary Pagans with an inclination towards National Socialism\". In a 2005 statement on his website, Vikernes wrote that although he had \"occasionally used the term 'nazism' to describe [his] ideological foundation\", he no longer describes himself as such. He had used the term following his 1994 conviction until the late 1990s.Vikernes, Varg: A Burzum Story: Part VII \u2013 The Nazi Ghost, July 2005. Retrieved 5 December 2012. Among other things, he did not wish to be associated with anti-Slavic sentiments. Since the late 1990s he has described his views as \"Odalism\", which he says encompasses \"Paganism, traditional nationalism, racialism and environmentalism\". Vikernes also advocates social conservatism, simple living and self-sufficiency (including survivalism). Vikernes has described his own ideology fiercely anti-modern. According to Eric Brown writing for the International Business Times, Vikernes opposes anything deemed \"a threat to a pre-industrial European pagan society, including but not limited to Christianity, Islam, Judaism, capitalism and materialism\", and he also \"rallies against a perceived international Jewish conspiracy to destroy the traditional European identity\". Vikernes wrote a blog post sympathetic to some of the views of Anders Behring Breivik, but said he suspected Breivik carried out his terrorist attack as part of a Jewish conspiracy. He condemned Breivik for killing innocent Norwegians and called him a \"Christian loser\", saying the only way to \"save Europe\" is to \"cast aside all Christian and other international nonsense and embrace only the European (i.e. Pagan) values and ideals\". ==Personal life== Vikernes has a son who was born in 2007 to his now wife Marie Cachet.VG Nett, 11 June 2008: Varg Vikernes for farlig for friheten They were married the same year.
