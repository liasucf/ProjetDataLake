    "text": "Calliaghstown Well, also called St. Columbkille's Well, is a holy well and National Monument located in County Meath, Ireland. ==Location== Calliaghstown Well is located beside a road just off the R150, south of Drogheda and the River Boyne and west of Julianstown.https://meathcountydevelopmentplan.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/appendix-11-national- monuments-in-state-care-register-of-historic-monuments1.pdf ==History and description== The well was a traditional site of pilgrimage for locals, and a pattern took place there each year on 9 June. A statue, erected perhaps in the mid-18th century, is called St Colm Cille, although with a mantle and crown it does not resemble traditional depictions of Columba/Colm Cille, who is usually depicted in a monk's habit (although he was of a royal family). The statue is tall and composed of oolitic limestone, similar to Bath stone. ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Meath Category:Archaeological sites in County Meath ",
