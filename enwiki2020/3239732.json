The district comprised the north-western part of present-day \u0160umadija and Western Serbia. Between 1922 and 1929, Podrinje Oblast existed in roughly the same area also with its seat in \u0160abac. In 1929, a large province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia known as the Drina Banovina was formed with its capital in Sarajevo. Drina Banovina included western parts of present-day Serbia and eastern parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following World War II Axis occupation in 1941, the province was abolished and its territory was divided between the Independent State of Croatia and the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia. In 1941 Yugoslav Partisans liberated the large western part of the German occupied territory. In this territory they proclaimed the Republic of U\u017eice (Uzi\u010dka Republika) with U\u017eice city as the centre of the Republic. This large free territory was an island of freedom in Nazi occupied Europe. The Republic of U\u017eice was short- lived. German troops occupied the territory again, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped towards Bosnia. When the Bosnian War broke out in 1992, the Drina Valley became the focus of a bitter campaign of ethnic cleansing by Serb forcesBe\u0107ir Bogilovi\u0107's evidence at Ori\u0107 trial, 21 March 2005, ICTY, p. 6367 , icty.org; retrieved 31 July 2010. which eventually culminated in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995.
