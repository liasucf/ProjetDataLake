The Temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, who is referred to as Chintala Venkataramana. The temple was built by Pemmasani Timmanayudu II of the Pemmasani Nayaks. It is situated on the bank of the Penna River, which passes through the town. The temple is known for its granite sculptures and is classified as one of the Monuments of National Importance by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temple has a Garuda Mandapa built as chariot with rotating granite wheels, which is similar to the one found in the Vithala Temple of Hampi. ==Etymology== According to legend, it is believed that, the presiding deity Venkateswara was found in the Tamarind (Telugu: Chinta) tree and hence got the name Chintala Venkataramana. ==History== The Temple was built during reign of Vijayanagara empire in mid 16th Century. Pemmasani Timmanayudu II, a contemporary of Vira Narasimharaya and Krishnadevaraya, built this temple. Timmanayudu built this temple after Lord Vishnu is said to have told Timmanayudu in a dream that a temple should be constructed for him at Tadipatri. Timmanayudu appointed two archakas and a chief-priest, and he gifted lands to the temple. The Chintalarayaswamy Temple is considered as one of the finest examples of Vijayanagara architecture. The initial structure may belong to Saluva dynasty, but the entrance towers belongs to the Tuluva dynasty. ==Architecture== The temple was built in Dravidian style. == Gallery == File:Chintalarayaswami Temple-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (1).jpg | Chintalaraya Temple with Vimanams File:INTRICATE STONE ART,TADPATRI,AP - panoramio.jpg | A huge pillar with a person riding the Yali File:Chintalarayaswami Temple-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (8).jpg | A wall with sculptures File:NARTAKA MUDRA VENKATRAMANA TEMPLE TADPATRI AP - panoramio.jpg | Nartaka Mudra File:Chintalarayaswami Temple-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (6).jpg| A idol depicting deity File:Elephants,tadpatri temple AP - panoramio.jpg | Elephants ==See also== * Bugga Ramalingeswara Swamy temple * Temples of Andhra Pradesh == References == Category:Hindu temples in Anantapur district Category:Archaeological sites in Andhra Pradesh ",
