    "text": "Gravel and Tar is a one-day cycling race, held annually in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, since 2016, finishing in Palmerston North. It is rated 1.2 and has been part of UCI Oceania Tour since 2018. The race is primarily on sealed roads, however the highlight of the race is the multiple gravel sectors (usually 5 or 6) throughout the course. The race is now considered to be the toughest one-day elite race in the Oceania region. The race is held in January each year, making it one of the first races on the UCI Calendar, and a key chance for teams and riders to gain early UCI points. Palmerston North was the starting location for the race for the first three years, before the race start moved to its current location in Feilding in 2019. The race course often transverses the gravel roads on the watersheds near Pohangina, and the peloton is easily fractured due to punctures & crashes on these sectors. The Gravel and Tar La Femme is the women's version of the race, held on the same day, and introduced in 2019. The La Femme race also holds a UCI 1.2 rating, and is one of a few elite female cycle races in the world where the prizemoney on offer is the same as the men's race. The race generally follows a shorter but similar course to the men's race, starting and finishing in the same locations. == Men's race == == Women's race == ==References== Category:Cycle races in New Zealand Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2016 Category:UCI Oceania Tour races ",
