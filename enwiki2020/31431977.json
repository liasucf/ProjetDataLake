Same- sex sexual activity is legal in Arizona, and same-sex couples are able to marry and adopt. Nevertheless, the state provides only limited protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Several cities, including Phoenix and Tucson, have ordinances in place designed to protect LGBT people from unfair discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. Phoenix and Tucson are home to a large LGBT community. The first Phoenix Pride parade took place in 1981, and now attracts thousands of attendees every year.Thousands of people attend Phoenix Pride Parade Tucson Pride was founded in 1977, the first in the state. ==History and legality of same-sex sexual activity== Arizona has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Similarly to many Native American tribes in the United States, these groups have traditions of cross-dressing and gender variance, and had perceptions of gender and human sexuality different to that of the Western world. There were no legal or social punishments for engaging in same-sex sexual activity. N\u00e1dleehi ( or n\u00e1dleeh\u00e9; literally one who constantly transforms) refers to individuals who are a \"male-bodied person with a feminine nature\". Historically, the Navajo recognized four gender roles: asdz\u00e1\u00e1n (feminine female), hastiin (masculine male), dilbaa (masculine female), and n\u00e1dleehi (feminine male). The n\u00e1dleehi identity is fluid, and such individuals may display both male and female characteristics. Due to the perceived \"balance\" between both sexes, they were typically chosen for certain societal and communal roles, such as spiritual healers. They would traditionally wear female clothes and do female work, and some would have sexual relations with men which was accepted by the tribe. (See also \"LGBT rights in the Navajo Nation\") The Tohono O'odham recognize the term wi:k\u2019ovat, which refers to individuals who are assigned male at birth but act, dress and behave as female. Other people groups recognize similar terms in reference to transgender people and gender variance; male-to-female individuals are hova among the Hopi, alyha among the Mohave, ilyaxai' among the Maricopa, t\u00fcwasawuts among the Southern Paiute, nd\u00e9\u02bcsdzan among the Western Apache, elxa among the Quechan, and elha among the Cocopah, whereas female-to-male individuals are hwame among the Mohave, kwiraxame among the Maricopa, kwe'rhame among the Quechan, and warrhameh among the Cocopah. Nowadays, the term \"two-spirit\" is increasingly used to refer to these identities. The relative openness to these different gender identities mostly disappeared after European settlement and colonization. Even among the Native Americans, societal perceptions began to change. Owing to the introduction of a more stringent set of beliefs on gender and sexuality by the Europeans, n\u00e1dleehi became the subject of ridicule. Today, LGBT Navajo may find it difficult being accepted by their family, with 70% of LGBT Navajo youth reportedly attempting suicide. Spanish missionaries took repeated notes of these traditions, with one Franciscan missionary stating \"that these accursed people will disappear with the growth of the missions. The abominable vice will be eliminated to the extent that the Catholic faith and all the other virtues are firmly implanted there, for the glory of God and the benefits of these poor ignorants\". Among the Hopi, Christian converts were prohibited from attending the traditional snake dance because \"male cross-dressing could be observed\". Jonathan Ned Katz notes, \"the Christianization of Native Americans and the colonial appropriation of the continent by white, Western 'civilization' included the attempt by the conquerors to eliminate various traditional forms of Indian homosexuality\u2014as part of their attempt to destroy that Native culture which might fuel resistance\u2014a form of cultural genocide involving both Native Americans and gay people\". Will Roscoe in his work The Zuni Man-Woman writes that the \"prevalence of sodomy\" and the tolerance or even respect of transgender people fueled the Spanish explorers' argument for the colonization of native peoples and their lands in the name of Christianity. Sodomy laws were first enacted after modern-day Arizona became part of the Spanish Empire, later joining the newly independent Mexico and finally the United States. Shortly after the Arizona Territory was established in 1863, the Arizona Territorial Legislature passed a criminal code containing provisions banning sodomy with five years' to life imprisonment. It was extended to include fellatio in 1912, while the penalty for sodomy was reduced to one to five years' imprisonment. As was the case for sodomy laws at the time, the code punished both heterosexual and homosexual conduct. In 1951, the penalty was changed to five to twenty years' imprisonment, and further crackdowns on homosexual activity were passed, requiring all those convicted under the sodomy laws to register with the local sheriff and report any change in address. Over the following years, the Arizona Supreme Court rejected multiple challenges that the law was vague and unconstitutional. In the summer of 1979, the Spiritual Conference for Radical Fairies took place at the Sri Ram Ashram near Benson, in which participants sought to expand the ideas of spirituality within the context of gay liberation.Hay, Harry, with Will Roscoe (ed.) (1996). Radically Gay: Gay Liberation in the Words of its Founder. Boston: Beacon Press. The Arizona Equity Act of 2001 repealed the state's sodomy laws and legalized homosexuality.Lee Walzer, Gay Rights on Trial: A Reference Handbook (2002), 82 ==Recognition of same-sex relationships== Arizona has recognized same-sex marriage since being forced to end enforcement of its statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage by the decision of a U.S. district court on October 17, 2014. In November 2006, Arizona voters rejected Proposition 106, which would have banned same-sex marriage and any legal status similar to marriage (such as civil unions or domestic partnerships). Two years later, however, Arizona voters approved the less restrictive Proposition 102 which amended the Constitution to ban the recognition of same-sex marriage. With no constitutional ban on domestic partnerships or civil unions, several cities, including Phoenix, Bisbee, Tucson, Flagstaff and more, subsequently enacted such measures. ==Adoption and parenting== Arizona permits adoption by individuals. There are no explicit prohibitions on adoption by same-sex couples or on second-parent adoptions.Human Resources Campaign: Arizona Adoption Law, December 7, 2009 , accessed April 10, 2011 However, state law requires adoption agencies to give primary consideration to adoptive placement with a married couple. Agencies may place a child with a legally single person if it is in the child's best interest or if there is not a married couple available. Lesbian couples have access to assisted reproduction services, such as in vitro fertilization. State law recognizes the non-genetic, non-gestational mother as a legal parent to a child born via donor insemination, but only if the parents are married. In September 2017, the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously ruled that same-sex spouses have the same parental rights as opposite-sex spouses under state law. Basing their ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges and Pavan v. Smith, the court concluded that married same-sex couples have the right to list both their names on their child(ren)'s birth certificate(s). Surrogacy, whether gestational or traditional, is prohibited under Arizona law. However despite this, surrogacy arrangements routinely occur in the state. Couples often petition courts for an order declaring them the legal parents of a child born through a surrogate. ===Arizona same-sex birth certificates=== In October 2020, the Arizona Court of Appeals made an explicit ruling that same-sex couples must have \"equality of parentage\" for children of same-sex couple parents - regardless if married or not. ==Discrimination protections== thumb|right|250px|Map of Arizona cities that had sexual orientation and/or gender identity anti\u2013employment discrimination ordinances prior to Bostock \u00b9Since 2020 as a result of Bostock, discrimination on account of sexual orientation or gender identity in public and private employment is outlawed throughout the state. Discrimination against state employees based on their sexual orientation has been illegal since 2003. Governor Janet Napolitano issued an executive order in 2003 prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation against state employees. Discrimination in public and private employment, housing and public accommodations on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited in Phoenix, Sedona, Tempe, Tucson, and Winslow. Flagstaff has protections for employment and public accommodations, but not housing. Other cities including Chandler, Gilbert, Glendale, Mesa, and Scottsdale prohibit discrimination on account of sexual orientation and gender identity against city employees. Peoria prohibits discrimination against city employees but on the basis of sexual orientation only. In February 2014, Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a \"religious freedom\" bill which would have granted any individual or legal entity an exemption from any state law if it substantially burdened their exercise of religion, widely reported as targeting LGBT people. Citing Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the Arizona Court of Appeals upheld Phoenix's anti-discrimination ordinance in June 2018, after a legal challenge seeking to strike it down was filed in 2016. Judge Lawrence Winthrop wrote in his decision: ===Bostock v. Clayton County=== On June 15, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County, consolidated with Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is discrimination on the basis of sex, and Title VII therefore protects LGBT employees from discrimination. ==Hate crime law== Arizona includes sexual orientation as a protected category covered under its hate crime law.Human Resources Campaign: Arizona Hate Crimes Law, October 3, 2008 , accessed April 10, 2011 The law provides additional legal penalties for the commission of a crime motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, amongst other categories. Gender identity is not included, though federal law covers crimes triggered by the victim's gender identity since the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law in October 2009. ==Transgender rights== Arizona will issue new birth certificates to post-operative transgender people. The state will alter the gender marker on a birth certificate \"for a person who has undergone a sex change operation or has a chromosomal count that establishes the sex of the person as different [than on original certificate]\". The Office of Vital Records will issue an amended birth certificate upon receipt of a completed \"Birth Certificate Request Form\", an \"Affidavit to Correct a Birth Certificate\" and a notarized letter from a physician confirming the sex operation.Human Resources Campaign: Arizona Birth Certificate Law: Gender Identity Issues, March 27, 2007 , accessed April 10, 2011 The state will change the gender marker on a driver's license and state ID card upon receipt of a \"signed statement from a licensed physician attesting that the applicant is irrevocably committed to the gender- change process.\" Changing gender on a driver's license and ID card does not require undergoing sex reassignment surgery. On 25 April 2019, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that family courts have the authority to determine the type of care a transgender child can receive, but only in limited circumstances. In a case that centered on a divorced couple who disagreed on how to care for their child with gender dysphoria, the court held that \"when an impasse occurs, the court is authorized to determine not only the parenting plan element in dispute, but also other factors that are necessary to promote and protect the emotional and physical health of the child\". The case was remanded to the family court with the directive that any future directives be narrowly tailored and supported by evidence that harm is imminent for the child. A regulation passed in 1982 states that Medicaid cannot cover the costs of sex reassignment surgery. In August 2020, two transgender teenagers, with the help of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and the National Health Law Program (NHeLP), along with co-counsel King & Spalding LLP and Perkins Coie LLP, filed a suit challenging the 1982 regulation as unconstitutional. ==Conversion therapy== In August 2017, the Pima County Board of Supervisors passed, in a 3\u20132 vote, an ordinance banning conversion therapy. Offenders may pay up to 2,500 dollars in fines. ==No promo homo law== In April 2019, the Arizona State Legislature repealed a 1991 law that prohibited AIDS- and HIV- related instruction that \"promotes a homosexual life-style\", \"portrays homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style\", or \"suggests that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex.\" Due to several pending court cases, the constitutionality of the law was questioned. The bill passed the House by a vote of 55-5, and the Senate by a 19-10 vote. The law went into effect on July 1, 2019. State Senator Sylvia Allen, a Republican, subsequently attempted to introduce a similar law. She proposed removing the word \"homosexuality\" from public school curricula and preventing any sex education before age 12. The legislation was scheduled to be heard by Arizona's Education Committee in January 2020, but the hearing was postponed so the proposal could be revised. ==Public opinion== Phoenix Pride parade, 2017 Public attitudes and opinions toward the LGBT community have evolved significantly in the past decades. A 2003 poll commissioned by the Northern Arizona University found that 54% of Arizonans opposed same-sex marriage, while 42% were in support. Subsequent polls recorded similar numbers. In 2013, a poll by Rocky Mountain Poll showed a 55% majority in favor of same-sex marriage, and opposition at 35%. Support then fell slightly to below 50% after the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2014, but then increased again, reaching 62% in 2016. A 2017 Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) poll found that 63% of Arizona residents supported same-sex marriage, while 28% opposed it and 9% were unsure.Public opinion on same-sex marriage by state: Arizona (PRRI) The same poll found that 73% of Arizonans supported an anti- discrimination law covering sexual orientation and gender identity, while 20% were opposed.Public opinion on LGBT nondiscrimination laws by state: Arizona (PRRI) Furthermore, 59% were against allowing public businesses to refuse to serve LGBT people due to religious beliefs, while 35% supported allowing such religiously-based refusals.Public opinion on religiously based refusals to serve gay and lesbian people by state: Arizona (PRRI) {| class=\"wikitable\" |+style=\"font-size:100%\" | Public opinion for LGBT anti-discrimination laws in Arizona |-style=\"text-align:right;\" ! style=\"width:190px;\"| Poll source ! style=\"width:200px;\"| Date(s) administered ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Sample size ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Margin of error ! style=\"width:100px;\"| % support ! style=\"width:100px;\"| % opposition ! style=\"width:40px;\"| % no opinion |- | Public Religion Research Institute | align=center| January 2-December 30, 2019 | align=center| 1,160 | align=center| ? | align=center| 71% | align=center| 23% | align=center| 6% |- | Public Religion Research Institute | align=center| January 3-December 30, 2018 | align=center| 1,237 | align=center| ? | align=center| 68% | align=center| 25% | align=center| 7% |- | Public Religion Research Institute | align=center| April 5-December 23, 2017 | align=center| 1,444 | align=center| ? | align=center| 73% | align=center| 20% | align=center| 7% |- | Public Religion Research Institute | align=center| April 29, 2015-January 7, 2016 | align=center| 1,560 | align=center| ? | align=center| 72% | align=center| 21% | align=center| 7% |} ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Homosexuality legal | Yes (Since 2001) |- | Equal age of consent | Yes (Since 2001) |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment |Yes (Since 2020) |- | Anti- discrimination laws in housing | No/Yes (Varies) |- | Anti-discrimination laws in public accommodations | No/Yes (Varies) |- | Same-sex marriages | Yes (Since 2014) |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | Yes (Since 2014) |- | Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples | Yes (Since 2014) |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | Yes (Since 2014) |- | Lesbians, gays, and bisexuals allowed to serve openly in the military | Yes (Since 2011) |- | Transgender people allowed to serve openly in the military | X |- | Conversion therapy banned on minors | No/Yes (Varies) |- | Access to IVF for lesbian couples | Yes |- | Surrogacy arrangements legal for gay male couples | No/Yes (Known to be performed despite statutory ban) |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No/Yes (Since 2020; 3-month deferral period) |} ==References== Category:Arizona law Rights Arizona Category:Politics of Arizona ",
