    "text": "Robert Fred Eastwood (born February 9, 1946) is an American professional golfer who has won numerous amateur and professional tournaments. Eastwood was born in Providence, Rhode Island, but spent most of his youth in north-central California. He started playing golf at age 4 as a result of his father being in the golf business. He helped his family construct Dry Creek Ranch Golf Club near Sacramento in the 1960s. During the 1960s, Eastwood served in the Army and was stationed in Korea. During this same decade he also attended San Joaquin Delta Community College and San Jose State University in San Jose, California. He turned pro in 1969. Eastwood has had a streaky career in amateur and professional golf. He won several amateur tournaments in the middle 1960s. His three wins on the PGA Tour came during a 15-month period in the mid-1980s. Likewise, his two wins on the Champions Tour both came in the same year, 1997. He has also had long dry spells with no victories and few top-10 finishes. His best finish in a major was a T-14 at the 1987 U.S. Open. Eastwood lives in Fort Worth, Texas. He enjoys hunting and fishing in his spare time. ==Amateur wins (5)== *1965 (2) Sacramento City Amateur Championship, Stockton City Championship *1966 (2) California State Amateur, Stockton City Championship *1968 (1) West Coast Athletic Conference Championship (individual) ==Professional wins (10)== ===PGA Tour wins (3)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Mar 25, 1984 |USF&G; Classic |\u201316 (66-68-68-70=272) |3 strokes | Larry Rinker |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Aug 5, 1984 |Danny Thomas Memphis Classic |\u20138 (71-69-68-72=280) |2 strokes | Ralph Landrum, Mark O'Meara, Tim Simpson |- |align=center|3 |align=right|May 12, 1985 |Byron Nelson Golf Classic |\u20138 (69-66-70-67=272) |Playoff | Payne Stewart |} PGA Tour playoff record (1\u20130) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\" |align=center|1 |1985 |Byron Nelson Golf Classic | Payne Stewart |Won with bogey on first extra hole |} ===Other wins (5)=== *1973 (1) Mini-Kemper Open *1976 (1) Little Bing Crosby *1979 (1) Windsor Charity Classic *1980 (1) Windsor Charity Classic *1981 (1) Morocco Grand Prix ===Senior PGA Tour wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runners-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|May 25, 1997 |Bell Atlantic Classic |\u20135 (66-69=135) |1 stroke | John Bland, Bob E.
