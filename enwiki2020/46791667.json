His first managerial experience came up in 2000, as he took over Gr\u00eamio's women squad. After being an assistant of Internacional's under-17 squad, Freitas took over the under-20 sides of Brasil de Farroupilha, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Cachoeira and Santa Cruz-RS before returning to Gr\u00eamio in 2005, as manager of the under-17s. He left the club in 2008 for Juventude, being in charge of the under-17s and under-20s while also acting as an interim first team manager for one S\u00e9rie B match. For the 2010 season, Freitas returned to Internacional, being named in charge of the under-20 team. In April of the following year, he was appointed Lisca's assistant at Luverdense. In August 2011, Freitas moved abroad for the first time in his career, joining Paraguayan side Club Guaran\u00ed as Beto Almeida's assistant; in late November, as Almeida was sacked, he took over the side in an interim manner. He then returned to Juventude the following February, being again named in charge of the under-20s while also taking over the B-team. Freitas then returned to Gr\u00eamio in 2013, being manager of the under-20s; in May 2015, he was named interim manager of the first team, as Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked.
