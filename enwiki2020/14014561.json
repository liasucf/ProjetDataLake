    "text": "Wazoo is a live album by Frank Zappa, posthumously released in October 2007 as a 2-CD set consisting of the complete concert given by \"The Mothers of Invention/Hot Rats/Grand Wazoo\" 20-piece big band on September 24, 1972 at the Music Hall, Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is the third installment on the Vaulternative Records label that is dedicated to the posthumous release of complete Zappa concerts, following the releases of FZ:OZ (2002) and Buffalo (2007). ==Overview== It is the last concert of a brief series of shows that marked Zappa's return to the stage after his forced temporary retirement from the touring scene due to the injuries he suffered from an assault during a concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London on December 10, 1971. The material showcases Zappa's endeavors in jazz-based music, and many of the compositions were featured on the 1972 studio albums The Grand Wazoo and Waka/Jawaka and on the 1978 studio album Studio Tan. Rehearsals leading to these albums and concerts are documented on Joe's Domage (2004), while Imaginary Diseases (2006) presents live recordings with a stripped-down version of the big band named 'Petit Wazoo'. == Production == === Sleeve design === The album cover is a visual parody of Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire, by Salvador Dal\u00ec. Frank Zappa's face replaces that of Voltaire's in the original, among other changes. == Track listing == All tracks written, composed and arranged by Frank Zappa. At the concert, \"Big Swifty\" was played between \"The Adventures of Greggery Peccary\" and \"Penis Dimension\".http://www.zappateers.com/fzshows/72.html. == Musicians == The Mothers of Invention / Hot Rats / Grand Wazoo: * Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar and white stick with cork handle * Tony Duran \u2013 slide guitar * Ian Underwood \u2013 electric piano and synthesizer * Jerry Kessler \u2013 electric cello * Dave Parlato \u2013 bass * Tom Raney \u2013 vibes and electric percussion * Ruth Underwood \u2013 marimba and electric percussion * Jim Gordon \u2013 acoustic & electric drums * Mike Altshul \u2013 piccolo flute, bass clarinet and other winds * Jay Migliori \u2013 flute, tenor sax and other winds * Earl Dumler \u2013 oboe, contrabass sarrusophone and other winds * Ray Reed \u2013 clarinet, tenor sax and other winds * Charles Owens \u2013 soprano sax, alto sax and other winds * Joann McNab \u2013 bassoon * Malcolm McNab \u2013 trumpet in D * Sal Marquez \u2013 trumpet in Bb * Tom Malone \u2013 trumpet in Bb, also tuba * Bruce Fowler \u2013 trombone of the upper atmosphere * Glenn Ferris \u2013 trombone and euphonium * Kenny Shroyer \u2013 trombone and baritone horn == Notes == == External links == * The Official Frank Zappa Site * Progarchives listing for Zappa Wazoo * Wazoo album at Discogs.com Category:Live albums published posthumously Category:Frank Zappa live albums Category:2007 live albums ",
