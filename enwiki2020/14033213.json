For the choir's first concert dedicated entirely to living composers, on 29 May 2002, the group received a four-star review from The Times. The choir has given a number of first performances, but more particularly aims to give second performances of works that might not otherwise be heard again. ==New commissioned music== The choir has commissioned eight new choral works: *Sounds: Three Kandinsky Poems (1999) \u2013 David Sawer *This Sceptr'd Isle (2005) \u2013 Paul Ayres *Dreaming England (This Sceptr'd Isle) (2005) \u2013 Peter McGarr *Tentatio (2006) \u2013 Jaakko M\u00e4ntyj\u00e4rvi *Their Lonely Betters (based on a poem by W.
