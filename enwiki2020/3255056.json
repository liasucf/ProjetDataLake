The Hidden History of the Nazi Resistance Movement. Tempus, Stroud 2006, p. 66. ==Biography== Micha\u0142 Vitu\u0161ka was born in the city of Nesvizh in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus) and studied in Belarusian gymnasiums in Kletsk, Wilno.Biography at slounik.org (Belarusian) He graduated from a university in Prague and the Warsaw University of Technology. In Warsaw Vitu\u0161ka joined the Belarusian Student Movement. Between 1939 and 1940 he served under the Chief of Soviet Police in Nesvizh.Antonio J. Mu\u00f1oz, Oleg V. Romanko: Hitler's White Russians: Collaboration, Extermination and Anti- partisan Warfare in Byelorussia, 1941-1944, Europa Books 2003, p. 452f. On 2 November 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the territories of West Belarus were annexed by the Soviet Union. The local population remained disaffected towards the Soviet occupants, so when Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, many people organized around the Belarusian Central Council, a Belarusian representative council in the Nazi-occupied Belarus, Vitu\u0161ka among them. In August 1941 he became one of the commanders of the Belarusian Self-Defense units formed in the Western part of Belarus. He was also a chief organizer of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police in Minsk. From 1942 to 1943 he organized Belarusian forces in Bryansk, Smolensk and Mogilev. He also became a part of the Belarusian Self-Help and had the rank of a major in the Byelorussian Home Defence. He took part in the 2nd Belarusian congress and beginning in the late summer of 1944 was also the officer of the Dallwitz parachute battalion. Still, soon some Belarusian national activists including Vitu\u0161ka formed a conspirative Belarusian Independence Party (\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0456\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b\u044f) that was led by Vitu\u0161ka along with Vincent Hadle\u016dski and Usevalad Rodzka.Andrew Wilson: Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship, Yale University Press, New Haven 2012, . p. 108 === Black Cats === Meanwhile, special units (SS-Jagdverb\u00e4nde) of local collaborationists were trained by the Germans to infiltrate the Soviet rear. They were trained in Dahlwitz near Berlin by SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Otto Skorzeny. The paratroopers came from Reichskommissariat Ostland; and were split into commandos based on the country of origin. As part of the Nazi effort to combat the growing Soviet partisan movement in Belarus during the war, some thirty Belarusians from the espionage and sabotage outfit known as \"\u010corny Kot\" (Black Cat) led by Micha\u0142 Vitu\u0161ka age 37, were airdropped by the Luftwaffe in late 1944 behind the lines of the Red Army. At that time, the German forces had been expelled from the present-day Belarus during Operation Bagration. Black Cats experienced some initial successes due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army. Other German- trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest in 1945.Perry Biddiscombe: The SS Hunter Battalions. The Hidden History of the Nazi Resistance Movement. Tempus, Stroud 2006, p. 66. Vitu\u0161ka became the coordination centre leader of the anti-soviet resistance partisan movement in Belarus. However, the NKVD secret police informants infiltrated these units. As the result, they were ambushed and killed in short order. At the beginning of the 1950s most of the leaders of the resistance movement had to escape to the West. Vitu\u0161ka fled to Western Europe. ==Legacy== Vitu\u0161ka is today openly honored by organization Young Front.\u041c\u0456\u0445\u0430\u043b \u0412\u0456\u0442\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430: \u0422\u041e\u041f-5 \u043c\u0456\u0444\u0430\u045e., mfront.net On November 5, 2007 activists of the organization were arrested after celebrating the hundredth birthday of Vitu\u0161ka.
