    "text": "Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner (27 September 1719 - 20 June 1800) was a German mathematician and epigrammatist. He was known in his professional life for writing textbooks and compiling encyclopedias rather than for original research. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was one of his doctoral students, and admired the man greatly. He became most well known for his epigrammatic poems. The crater K\u00e4stner on the Moon is named after him. == Life == K\u00e4stner was the son of law professor Abraham K\u00e4stner. He married Anna Rosina Baumann in 1757 after a 12-year engagement. She died on 4 March 1758, less than a year later, of a lung disease. Later K\u00e4stner had a daughter Catharine with his cleaning lady. K\u00e4stner studied law, philosophy, physics, mathematics and metaphysics in Leipzig from 1731, and was appointed a Notary in 1733. He gained his habilitation from the University of Leipzig in 1739,Abraham K\u00e4stner \u2013 MacTutor MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive and lectured there in mathematics, philosophy, logic and law, becoming an associate professor in 1746. In 1751 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1756 he took up a position as full professor of natural philosophy and geometry at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1763, succeeding Tobias Mayer, he became director of the observatory as well. One of his doctoral students was the physicist and aphorist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who became a colleague of his at G\u00f6ttingen. Other notable doctoral students were Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben, Johann Pfaff (doctoral advisor of Carl Friedrich Gauss), Johann Tobias Mayer, Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes, Farkas Bolyai (father of J\u00e1nos Bolyai), and Georg Kl\u00fcgel. K\u00e4stner died in 1800 in G\u00f6ttingen. == Work == De habitu matheseos et physicae ad religionem, 1752 Kaestner became most well known for his poems, which appeared first in print without his consent in 1781 and were notable for their biting humour and sharp irony on different contemporary personalities. They were published in Vermischten Schriften 1 und 2 (Altenburg 1783, 2 volumes), and further poems were published in Gesammelten poetischen und prosaischen sch\u00f6nwissenschaftlichen Werken (Berlin 1841, 4 volumes) and later in Joseph K\u00fcrschner's Deutscher Nationalliteratur, volume 73 (hrsg. von Minor; Stuttgart 1883). His numerous mathematical writings include Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Mathematik (\"Foundations of Mathematics\") (G\u00f6ttingen 1758-69, 4 volumes; 6th edition 1800) and Geschichte der Mathematik (\"History of Mathematics\") (G\u00f6ttingen 1796-1800, 4 volumes). Geschichte der Mathematik is considered an astute work, but lacks a comprehensive overview of all subsections of mathematics. He also translated many volumes of the Proceedings of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences into German, including all volumes of the Proceedings (Handlingar) between 1749 and 1781 and some volumes of New Proceedings (Nya handlingar) from 1784 to 1792. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1789. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Theoria radicum in aequationibus \u2013 Europeana Category:1719 births Category:1800 deaths Category:18th-century German mathematicians Category:German Lutherans Category:German encyclopedists Category:Historians of mathematics Category:Writers from Leipzig Category:People from the Electorate of Saxony Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Leipzig University faculty Category:University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:18th-century male writers ",
