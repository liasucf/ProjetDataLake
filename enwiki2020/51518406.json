Her family, noted for its teachers and priests, originated from Krupa na Vrbasu. She was a daughter of \u0110or\u0111e Vranje\u0161evi\u0107, a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church and an active member of the Agrarian Party, with whom she was very close. Her conservative mother, An\u0111a, was the sister of Branko Zagorac, who had been sentenced to three years of prison for his part in the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. Rada and her older sister Nevenka (later a teacher) were greatly influenced by their uncle's leftist ideas; other siblings were a younger sister named Ljuba (a dental technician) and a brother who drowned in the Vrbas river. == Education == Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 attended primary school in a village near Prnjavor, and gymnasium in Derventa and Banja Luka. She aspired to become a teacher but was expelled in 1932 due to her affiliation with the outlawed Communist Party. In 1933, she enrolled a merchants' academy and joined a Communist youth organization, but was considered too young and physically frail to take part in its activities. This nevertheless again led to expulsion from school. By this time she was romantically involved with the Muslim journalist Safet Filipovi\u0107, who too was a Communist sympathizer. Such inter- ethnic romance was \"unusual and bold\" at the time, but Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded in winning her clerical family's approval for both their relationship and political activities. From 1936 until 1937 she attended school in Skopje, and grew very fond of Macedonia and its people. Taking interest in the Macedonian Question along with her peers, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was a vocal supporter of Macedonian nationalism, although she only spoke Serbian (with an \"amusing Bosnian accent\"). == Second World War == Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was unable to find employment after finishing the merchants' academy, and moved back in with her parents near Prnjavor. In 1939 she started working in Belgrade, and was thrilled to start an independent life in the Yugoslav capital. She and her boyfriend, Safet Filipovi\u0107, lived together in a small studio apartment. Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 immediately took part in the activities of the Communist Party, which she officially joined in 1940. She was arrested the same year after organizing a strike action and released only due to intervention of the government minister Branko \u010cubrilovi\u0107, her father's acquaintance. Having lost her job, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was urged by her parents to return to Bosnia, but she refused. Instead she took up campaigning in Montenegro on behalf of the Party. In April 1941, Yugoslavia was swiftly overrun by Axis forces. The Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state, was set up on the territory of Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its racial policy led to a widespread persecution of Serbs. Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 went to Banja Luka after the bombing of Belgrade, but soon returned. She and Filipovi\u0107 left Belgrade together and returned to Banja Luka on 1 May, where she entered the Partisan resistance movement. Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and sent to Danica concentration camp in late June, and in early July Vranje\u0161evi\u0107's parents and sister Ljuba were deported to Serbia. Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 took up wearing niq\u0101b and was sheltered by Vahida Maglajli\u0107, a prominent Banja Luka Muslim whose house served as supply store and shelter for Partisan fighters. Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was successful in recruiting Banja Luka women to the Partisan cause. The Communist Party decided that Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 should go to the free territory surrounding the Grme\u010d mountain. Maglajli\u0107 organized the transfer, and the veiled Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 left in September. She later used the veil to conceal sanitary material and ammunition. In November 1942, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was elected member of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party in Bosanska Krajina. She was among the founding members of the Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later became member of the Central Committee of the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia. Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was one of only four women, among 170 delegates, to take part in the State Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) in Mrkonji\u0107 Grad on 25 November 1943. == Death == In the spring of 1944, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was sent by the Party to work in the western Bosnian town of Drvar. Nazi Germany launched a raid on Drvar on 25 May, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107's 26th birthday, and she was captured by the paratroopers. She was killed in an attempt to escape the next day. Following the liberation of Yugoslavia, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107's remains were transferred to the Partisan cemetery in Banja Luka. On 27 July 1951, Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 was declared a People's Hero of Yugoslavia. == References == Category:1918 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina people of World War II Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina women in politics Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Women in the Yugoslav Partisans Category:League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians Category:People from Banja Luka Category:Recipients of the Order of the People's Hero Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany Category:Women's Antifascist Front Category:Yugoslav Partisans members ",
