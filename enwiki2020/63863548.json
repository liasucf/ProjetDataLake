On March 20, 2020, the government of Yukon advised to stop all non-essential travel. On March 22, after its first case, the government limited non-essential travel out of the territory or into remote communities to protect Yukon's most vulnerable citizens. On April 17, minister of community services John Streicker signed the Ministerial Order, which allowed enforcement officers to deny entry to non-essential travellers. All schools are currently closed. On March 22, 2020, Premier Sandy Silver and the Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Hanley, announced that Yukon had its first cases of COVID-19 in Yukon, a couple who had attended a convention in the United States and then returned home to Whitehorse. == References == ==External links== * Government of Yukon \u2013 Case counts: COVID-19 Yukon Yukon Category:Disasters in Yukon Category:2020 in Yukon ",
