    "text": "The Immanuel High School is a historic school building in rural Arkansas County, Arkansas. It is located at 68 Immanuel Road, about east of Arkansas Highway 33, east of Almyra. It is a single-story wood frame structure in a U shape, covered in siding, with a cross-gable roof. Built c. 1940, it is the only surviving element of the Immanuel Industrial Institute, a larger complex of buildings built to educate the local African-American population. The complex was merged into a regional school district in 1950, and was closed in 1966. It was used for a variety of other private and non-profit educational purposes afterward, but has been vacant since the mid-1990s. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Arkansas County, Arkansas ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:School buildings completed in 1945 Category:Buildings and structures in Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas County, Arkansas ",
