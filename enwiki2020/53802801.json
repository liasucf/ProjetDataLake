    "text": "This is a list of earthquakes in 1965. Only magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes appear on the list. Lower magnitude events are included if they have caused death, injury or damage. Events which occurred in remote areas will be excluded from the list as they wouldn't have generated significant media interest. All dates are listed according to UTC time. Maximum intensities are indicated on the Mercalli intensity scale and are sourced from United States Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap data. A fairly busy year with 18 magnitude 7.0+ events. Two of these were above magnitude 8 and struck within 10 days of each other. The largest of the year was a magnitude 8.7 which struck the Rat Islands, Alaska in February. No deaths were reported from this event. Vanuatu had a series of destructive events in August. Of the 712 deaths in 1965, most came from an event in Chile in March which had 400 fatalities. == Overall == === By death toll === {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" |- !
