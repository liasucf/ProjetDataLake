The bank is one of the commercial banks in the Republic of Rwanda, licensed by National Bank of Rwanda, the national banking regulator. ==Overview== , the bank's total assets were valued in excess of US$192.2 million (RWF:134 billion), with shareholders' equity valued at US$19.65 million (RWF:13.7 billion). ==History== Cogebanque was established in July 1999 by forty-two private Rwandan investors. At that time, the insurance company Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Assurance et de Reassurance (COGEAR), was the largest shareholder, with 34% ownership. In the beginning, the bank's emphasis was Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), agriculture and the service industries. In 2008, three new international investors paid US$6 million for a 40% ownership in the bank. The new investors included: (a) ShoreCap International (SCI) of Chicago, Illinois, United States; (b) the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO) and (c) AfricaInvest, an investment company based in Tunisia. These transactions, initiated in 2008, were concluded in early 2010. The original Rwandan investors maintain a 60% shareholding in the restructured bank. ==Branch Network== As of March 2015, Cogebanque maintained branches at the following locations: # Cogebanque Headquarters \u2013 Centenary House, KN 4 Avenue, Kigali # Rond-Point Branch \u2013 BIB Trading Building, KN 1 Round About, Kigali # Rubangura Branch \u2013 Rubangura House, KN 2 Street, Kigali # Nyabugogo Branch \u2013 Chez Manu Building, KN 1 Road, Kigali # Nyarutarama Branch \u2013 MTN Centre, KG 9 Avenue, Kigali # Gisozi Branch \u2013 Companion House, KG 33 Avenue, Gisozi, Kigali # Remera Branch \u2013 Nyiransengimana Justine Building, KG 11 Avenue, Kigali # Kicukiro Branch \u2013 Inind House, Kigali # Rwamagana Branch \u2013 Rusirare Jacques Building , Rwamagana, Eastern Rwanda # Kabarondo Branch \u2013 Cogebanque Building, Kabarondo , Eastern Rwanda # Huye Branch \u2013 Bihira Juvenal Building, Butare, Huye District, Southern Rwanda # Nyamagabe Branch \u2013 Kanimba Building, Nyamagabe, Southern Rwanda # Muhanga Branch \u2013 Mukantabana Speciose Building, Gitarama, Southern Rwanda # Musanze Branch \u2013 Economat Diocese Building, Ruhengeri, Northern Rwanda # Rubavu Branch \u2013 Munyandekwe Issa Building, Rubavu, Western Rwanda # Kamembe Branch \u2013 Twizeyimana Vincent Building, Kamembe, Western Rwanda # Tyazo Branch \u2013 Kagorora Jacques Building, Tyazo, Southern Rwanda # Nyagatare Branch \u2013 Karangwa House, Eastern Rwanda # Prestige Banking Branch \u2013 Centenary House, Kigali. ==See also== * List of banks in Rwanda * Economy of Rwanda ==References== ==External links== * Overview of the Beginnings of Cogebanque Category:Banks of Rwanda Category:Banks established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Rwanda Category:Organisations based in Kigali Category:Economy of Kigali ",
