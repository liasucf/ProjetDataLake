The following year, he was signed by Bernard Hinault's La Vie Claire team. In his first full season as a pro, 1986, he won the Tour de Suisse and helped his compatriot and team leader Greg LeMond to victory in the Tour de France. He also finished the Tour de France fourth overall and claimed the white jersey of best young rider. In 1987, Hampsten repeated his victory in the Tour de Suisse, this time for the 7-Eleven Cycling Team. His greatest moment came in the 1988 Giro d'Italia, on a short stage over the Gavia Pass. Attacking on the climb, Hampsten overcame a severe snowstorm to take the Maglia Rosa - although he finished second on the stage to Dutchman Erik Breukink. The conditions during this stage were among the worst in cycling history. During and following this stage numerous cyclists abandoned and several had to be loaded into ambulances and taken to the hospital due to hypothermia like symptoms. Hampsten's teammate Bob Roll finished the stage, but his condition following the stage shows among the harshest looks at what the elements can do to a rider who pushes himself to the absolute limit. After surviving this Gavia Pass stage he was able to successfully defend the Leader's jersey through the rest of the race and as a result he became just the 2nd American to win a cycling Grand Tour and the 1st American to win the Giro d'Italia. Then again during the 1989 Giro d'Italia Hampsten performed at an elite level among the General Classification riders finishing on the podium in 3rd place overall. He also was among the elite riders for the majority of the 1990 Tour de France. Hampsten's final highlight came in the 1992 Tour de France when he dropped his breakaway companions to win the stage to Alpe d'Huez. He again finished the race fourth, having lost his third place to Gianni Bugno in the final time trial. ==Life after racing== Hampsten used to live in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and the 40-mile bikeway system there has been dedicated as the \"Andy Hampsten Bikeway System.\"Dedication of Andy Hampsten Bikeway System Hampsten now lives in Tuscany and Boulder, Colorado. In 1999, Andy Hampsten and his brother Steve started a bicycle company in Seattle, Washington, called Hampsten Cycles. Andy Hampsten also operates a bicycle touring company in Italy called Cinghiale Cycling Tours. ==Career achievements== ===Major results=== Source: ;1984 : 2nd Overall Coors Classic ;1985 : 1st Stage 20 Giro d'Italia ;1986 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Prologue : 4th Overall Tour de France ::1st 20px Young rider classification ;1987 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ;1988 : 1st 20px Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st 20px Mountains classification ::1st 20px Combination classification ::1st Stages 12 & 18 (ITT) : 1st Stage 3 Paris\u2013Nice ;1989 : 1st Stage 2 Tour of the Basque Country : 1st Subida a Urkiola : 3rd Overall Giro d'Italia ;1990 : 1st Subida a Urkiola : 3rd Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Stage 7 ;1991 : 3rd Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st 20px Mountains classification : 5th Overall Paris\u2013Nice : 8th Overall Tour de France ;1992 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Romandie ::1st Stage 3 : 4th Overall Tour de France ::1st Stage 14 (Alpe d'Huez) : 5th Overall Giro d'Italia : 5th Coppa Agostoni : 10th Coppa Bernocchi ;1993 : 1st 20px Overall Tour of Galicia ::1st Stage 2 : 3rd Overall Tour de Romandie : 8th Overall Tour de France ;1994 : 3rd Overall Tour de Romandie : 3rd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme : 10th Overall Giro d'Italia ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 1985 ! scope=\"col\" | 1986 ! scope=\"col\" | 1987 ! scope=\"col\" | 1988 ! scope=\"col\" | 1989 ! scope=\"col\" | 1990 ! scope=\"col\" | 1991 ! scope=\"col\" | 1992 ! scope=\"col\" | 1993 ! scope=\"col\" | 1994 ! scope=\"col\" | 1995 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A gold jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia |20 |\u2014 |\u2014 |bgcolor=pink |1 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|3 |\u2014 |\u2014 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|5 |14 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|10 |58 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France |\u2014 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|4 |16 |15 |22 |11 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|8 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|4 |style=\"background:#ddddff;\"|8 |\u2014 |\u2014 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |} ==Notes== ==External links== *Hampsten Cycles *Bike touring company Hampsten runs *Story and interview with Hampsten about his 1988 Giro win.
