    "text": "Can I Have My Money Back? is the first solo album by Gerry Rafferty. The distinctive cover design was by John Patrick Byrne and was the start of a long working relationship between Rafferty and the playwright. The LP was well received, but performed poorly in charts and sales, in part because Rafferty had just left a well known band, The Humblebums. The album also saw Joe Egan come on board, and the pair formed Stealers Wheel shortly afterwards. The album was re-issued in 2000 on CD (subtitled \"The Best of Gerry Rafferty\") with a different cover design (Castle Music, Ltd; Cat. No. ESMCD-879). Released only in the United Kingdom, it featured an additional twelve Humblebums tracks. ==Track listing== All tracks composed and arranged by Gerry Rafferty; except where indicated # \"New Street Blues\" # \"Didn't I?\" # \"Mr. Universe\" # \"Mary Skeffington\" # \"The Long Way Round\" # \"Can I Have My Money Back?\" # \"Sign on the Dotted Line\" (Rafferty, Joe Egan) # \"Make You, Break You\" # \"To Each and Everyone\" # \"One Drink Down\" (Rafferty, John Byrne) # \"Don't Count Me Out\" # \"Half a Chance\" # \"Where I Belong\" Singles: \"Can I Have My Money Back?\" b/w \"So Bad Thinking\" (Transatlantic: BIG 139) \"Make You, Break You\" (mono) b/w \"Make You, Break You\" (stereo) (Signpost: SP-70001; USA) \"Didn't I\" b/w \"Can I Have My Money Back?\" (Big T: BIG 139) \"Mr Universe\" b/w \"Can I Have My Money Back?\" (Transatlantic: M 25.565) Note: CD releases include a different performance of \"Mary Skeffington\" from that which appears on the original vinyl LP; the latter has a relatively sparer arrangement, emphasising acoustic guitar, and was later released by Rab Noakes (who contributed to several tracks on \"Money Back\") on his \"Demos and Rarities Vol. 2 - Adventures with Gerry Rafferty\" collection.
