Recorded between 2010 and 2011, it was released on 15 April 2011 by record label Dew Process; their first release since their hiatus following 2005's Anniversary E.P. == Background and recording == The band commenced writing for the album in 2006. The recording of the album was undertaken following a period of hiatus for the band and the relocation to Melbourne of lead singer\u2013rhythm guitarist Kevin Mitchell. Recording occurred at Blackbird Studios in Perth, Australia, and production duties were undertaken by Dave Parkin (owner of the studio) in collaboration with the band. Kevin Mitchell revealed in a radio interview: > It's probably the only time we've ever made a record where it was actually > finished when it was finished. Every other time you're pretty much given a > month or a two month block. When that last day ticks over the record is > finished; whether it's finished or not. So this was an absolutely luxury to > do it that way. == Promotion and release == The band performed \"She's Like a Comet\" on Australian morning television program Sunrise. On each of the twelve days leading up to the album's release, a short video (around one minute) was uploaded to the band's YouTube page, in which the band provides insight into each of the album's songs. Kosciuszko was released on 15 April 2011 by record label Dew Process. It reached number 6 in the ARIA Chart, staying in the chart for six weeks. As well as being available on CD, a limited number of copies were also released on vinyl. == Track listing == == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2011) !align=\"left\"|Peak Position !align=\"left\"|Weeks In |- | align=\"left\"|Australian ARIA Albums Chart | align=\"center\"|6 | align=\"center\"|5 |} == References == Category:2011 albums Category:Jebediah albums Category:Dew Process albums ",
