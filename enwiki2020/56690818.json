    "text": "Interior of the Royal Victoria Theatre The Royal Victoria Theatre was a theatre in Sydney, Australia, the first large theatre in the city. It opened in 1838; operas, plays, pantomimes and other events were held, and leading entertainers performed at the theatre. It was destroyed by fire in 1880. ==Background and opening== The theatre was built by Joseph Wyatt; formerly a haberdasher, he had been a lessee of the first theatre in Sydney, the Theatre Royal, since 1835, and the sole lessee since 1836. In that year he planned another larger theatre. The building was designed by Henry Robertson; the foundation stone was laid on 7 September 1836.Royal Victoria Theatre (Sydney) Australian Variety Theatre Archive. Retrieved 26 February 2018. The new theatre, in Pitt Street, opened on 26 March 1838, with a performance of Shakespeare's Othello. The theatre had a three-storey fa\u00e7ade of Georgian style, and the front section included a hotel. The interior was of Regency style. There were 1,900 seats. 1,000 were in a large pit extending below the dress circle \u2013 the first theatre in Australia to have this arrangement \u2013 with upper circle and gallery above. Entry to the dress and upper circle was through the main entrance, and other patrons used a side entrance. The Sydney Monitor reported that the building was \"truly elegant. ... From the pit you would suppose that you were in a large provincial theatre in England.\" In 1841 the theatre was fitted with gas lighting.Richard Fotheringham, Angela Turner. Australian Plays for the Colonial Stage. University of Queensland Press. 2006. Page 48. ==Following years== Actors associated with the Theatre Royal moved to the Victoria Theatre, including John Lazar, who was manager of the theatre until the early 1840s. The population of Sydney was small in relation to the size of the theatre, so that a proper repertoire could not be built up: there were frequent changes of programme, leading to poorly rehearsed performances. In March 1841 Wyatt sailed for England to recruit actors, returning in January 1843. While he was away the theatre was managed by William Knight, a hotel owner. The new actors engaged faced opposition from the Sydney actors, and the Sydney Morning Herald commented on 25 January 1843: \"Of the twelve brought out by him from England there is not one equal in ability to the leading members, male or female, of the old company\". Wyatt eventually sacked some of his actors. Operas, dramas, burlesques, pantomimes and other amusements were held. George Coppin made his Australian debut in the theatre in 1843. Other performers seen during the theatre's history included Lola Montez, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, Anna Bishop, George Darrell and William Creswick. The first opera written, composed and produced in Australia, Don John of Austria, premiered there in May 1847.Program notes, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, October 2007 In 1854 the theatre was purchased by a consortium including Joshua Josephson, and leased by a succession of managers. On 22 July 1880, the uninsured theatre burned to the ground. ==References== Category:Former theatres in Sydney Category:Theatres completed in 1838 Category:1880 disestablishments in Australia ",
