    "text": "Inland is the second novel the Serbian-American author T\u00e9a Obreht. The book was published by Random House on August 13, 2019, eight years after Obreht's 2011 debut novel, The Tiger's Wife. ==Plot== The novel follows two parallel narratives in the American frontier. Living in the lawless, drought-ridden lands of the Arizona Territory in 1893, 37-year-old frontierswoman Nora Lark waits inside her home for the return of the men in her life. Nora's husband, Emmett, left in search of water for the household and their two elder sons left following an explosive argument. Nora lives with her youngest son, who is convinced that a mysterious beast is stalking the land surrounding their home. She also lives with Emmett's wheelchair-bound mother, Missus Harriet, as well as Emmett's cousin, Josie, a clairvoyant who hosts seances to communicate with the dead. Nora, affected by her loneliness and isolation, speaks to her long- dead daughter, Evelyn, who died of heat stoke in Arizona as a baby. Lurie Mattie, an immigrant Muslim from a Balkan piece of the Ottoman Empire, is a former outlaw and a man haunted by ghosts. He is able to see lost souls who want something from him, and he acquires their \"wants\". Lurie finds reprieve from the soul's longing in an unexpected relationship with Burke, a dromedary camel from the United States Camel Corps. However, Lurie is being pursued by a marshal on a charge of manslaughter and he takes cover in the Camel Corps. They are led by the camel driver Hi Jolly (aka Hadji Ali), a Turk of Syrian- Greek descent and a convert to Islam. Lurie travels with Burke in the Camel Corps on a westward trek from Texas. ==Publication== Inland was published by Random House on August 13, 2019. The novel debuted at number twelve on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction best-sellers list on September 1, 2019. ==Reception== On the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \"Rave\" rating based on 46 reviews: 30 \"Rave\" reviews, 12 \"Positive\" reviews, 3 \"Mixed\" reviews, and 1 \"Pan\" review. Ron Charles of The Washington Post praised the novel, writing, \"The unsettling haze between fact and fantasy in \"Inland\" is not just a literary effect of Obreht's gorgeous prose; it's an uncanny representation of the indeterminate nature of life in this place of brutal geography.\" Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Chanelle Benz stated, \"Obreht's simple but rich prose captures and luxuriates in the West's beauty and sudden menace. Remarkable in a novel with such a sprawling cast, Obreht also has a poetic touch for writing intricate and precise character descriptions.\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Carolyn Kellogg gave the novel a mixed review, praising the characters of Lurie and Burke but lamented, \"It's unfortunate that among all the varied characters we meet in Inland, Native Americans don't ever leave the periphery. It's a missed opportunity. At times, this sweeping story seems almost too big for even a writer of Obreht's gifts.\" ==References== Category:Novels by T\u00e9a Obreht Category:2019 American novels Category:Random House books Category:Novels set in Arizona Category:Fiction about the United States Army Category:Ghosts in written fiction Category:Fiction set in 1893 Category:Novels set in the 1890s ",
