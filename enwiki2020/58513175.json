Johnson. On this session he's joined by the always superb pianist Hank Jones, plus Wendell Marshall and Kenny Clarke. ... Bert's been more active as a sideman than a leader since the '50s, so this is one album that his fans need to acquire\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Eddie Bert except where noted # \"Fragile\" (Ernie Wilkins) \u2013 5:25 # \"Stompin' at the Savoy\" (Edgar Sampson, Benny Goodman, Andy Razaf, Chick Webb) \u2013 3:19 # \"I Should'a Said\" \u2013 4:32 # \"See You Later\" \u2013 5:02 # \"Three Bass Hit\" (Ozzie Cadena) \u2013 7:36 # \"What D'Ya Say?\" (Cadena) \u2013 5:45 # \"Billie's Bounce\" (Charlie Parker) \u2013 3:37 ==Personnel== *Eddie Bert \u2013 trombone *Hank Jones \u2013 piano *Wendell Marshall \u2013 bass *Kenny Clarke \u2013 drums ==References== Category:Savoy Records albums Category:Eddie Bert albums Category:1955 albums Category:Albums produced by Ozzie Cadena Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
