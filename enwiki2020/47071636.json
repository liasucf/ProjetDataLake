Alexander Stewart (c. 1799 \u2013 15 January 1883), arrived in South Australia on the Duchess of Northumberland in December 1839 with his wife, two stepsons and two stepdaughters and settled on a property on the Mosquito Plains, near Naracoorte. Nearby properties were taken up around the same time by John Stewart, for whom Stewart's Ranges near Naracoorte was named, and Charles Stewart of Avenue Plains (near Lucindale, 40 km from Naracoorte). It is not certain what relation Charles and John were to Alexander. Some time before 1870 Alexander took over a cattle property \"Woodlands\" at Morphett Vale. James Stewart, was born in the South East of South Australia, and grew up at \"Moy Hall\" on the Mosquito Plains. He was educated at Portland, Victoria, St. Peter's College, and Whinham's Grammar School in North Adelaide. He married and took over a sheep station in Victoria, which he later sold at a substantial profit, and retired to \"Hackham House\", Hackham, and was a member of the Adelaide Hunt Club. James Stewart was MHA for Noarlunga from March 1870 \u2013 December 1871. He failed in his bid to be re-elected. He died at Hackham House after a long illness. He married twice; he had a daughter and three sons by his first wife and a daughter by his second. ==Family== James Stewart's father Alexander Stewart (c. 1799\u20131883) arrived in South Australia in 1839 with his wife, who before their marriage was Mrs. Hay, two stepsons and two stepdaughters.
