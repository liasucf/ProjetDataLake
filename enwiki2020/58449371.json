The house was designed by James Milne Monro. It was later improved by Robert Cumming in 1913. It is known as the main building in the four street area known as \"Glasgow's Electric Suburb\" because the houses were the first in Glasgow to be built with internal electrical wiring \u2013 including electric lights and electric cookers. In the late 20th century it was used as a nursing home, before it was purchased in 2003 for religious activities and retreats. Hazelwood House is within the Hazelwood Conservation Area, created on 8 March 2002. The house serves as a religious retreat and conference centre. It hosts annual public events such as Christmas carol concerts and family days. == Architecture and features == Its notable architectural features include symmetrical front bay windows, a Tudor arch over the front door and a slate roof. A lodge is adjacent. Substantial private gardens host a brick-walled, earthenware coping and mature trees. == Access == The public can access the house on walking tours that take place during Doors Open Days each September. == References == Category:Arts and Crafts movement Category:Category B listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Category:Pollokshields Category:Houses in Glasgow ",
