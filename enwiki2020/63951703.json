    "text": "Parmotrema zicoi is a species of saxicolous lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. Found in Brazil, it was introduced as new to science in 2002. ==Taxonomy== It was originally described from collections made in Serra do Cara\u00e7a, Brazil, where it was found growing at an elevation of . The specific epithet zicoi honours the priest Tobias Zico, who, as a former administrator for the Parque Natural do Cara\u00e7a, promoted the \"preservation of a most important type locality for numerous lichens, animals, and plants in Brazil\". ==Description== The lichen has a seafoam-green thallus up to wide, comprising overlapping lobes that are 2.0\u20135.0 mm wide. The margins of the lobes have simple cilia that are up to 1 mm long. The cortex contains atranorin, while the medulla contains protocetraric acid. Occasionally, the medullary K spot test reaction is positive, producing a very light yellow colour that indicates the presence of traces of atranorin in the upper part of the medulla near the cortex. P. zicoi has short bacilliform-shaped conidia that are less than 5 \u03bcm long. The lichen does not produce any form of vegetative propagation or pustules. ==See also== *List of Parmotrema species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 2002 Category:Fungi of South America zicoi ",
