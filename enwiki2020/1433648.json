    "text": "Tweeling (meaning twin in Dutch and Afrikaans) is a small town situated 22 km from Frankfort in the Free State province of South Africa. The adjacent black township is named Mafahlaneng, or \"place of twins\". This region of the highveld is colloquially known as the Riemland, recalling a time when it was a favoured hunting ground of the early pioneers. The town was established in 1920 on the two farms Tweelingspruit and Tweelingkop, their names derived from two similar looking hills just outside the town. It is situated just east of the Liebenbergsvlei River which is a conduit for water from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Tweeling is home to annual VKB Liebensbergvlei Canoe Marathon ==References== == External Links == https://dabulamanzi.co.za/liebenbergsvlei/ Category:Populated places in the Mafube Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1920 ",
