    "text": "Espace Dal\u00ed The Espace Dal\u00ed is a permanent exhibition in France devoted to Salvador Dal\u00ed consisting mainly of sculptures and engravings. The museum, near the Place du Tertre in the Montmartre district of Paris, has around 300 original artworks. The collection features mainly three-dimensional sculptures of Dal\u00ed's best known surrealistic paintings. The collection exhibited is part of the Dal\u00ed Universe collection, curated by Beniamino Levi, Italian gallerist and collector. Sculptures such as Space Elephant and Alice in Wonderland are presented, and the visitor can also see other aspects such as Moses and monotheism, Memories of Surrealism, Don Quixote, etc. Music plays in the background, and there are creative workshops for children to give them the opportunity to become familiar with Dal\u00ed's art. Adjacent to the museum are two art galleries: the Galerie Dal\u00ed which presents a selection of some of the artist's works (sculptures, engravings and lithographs), and the Galerie Montmartre, which shows the works of several contemporary artists. == Temporary exhibitions == Espace Dal\u00ed presents each year a new temporary exhibition : * 2008 : Dal\u00ed et la Mode, *2008/2009 : Dal\u00ed - Hologrammes et jeux d'optique *2009 : Dal\u00ed \u00e0 l'\u0152uvre] Espace Dal\u00ed shows the heart of the creation in the artist stating, from April 10 to June 24, Dal\u00ed at work. Over 100 photographs taken in 1950 by a friend and specialist Master Robert Descharnes, reveal the artist in full creativity. Carefully selected by Nicolas Descharnes, expert of the work, these photographs show the artist, visionary, struggling with his most unusual tools often. The eye of Robert Descharnes seized the moment to play the creation of the work.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/7/Dali-a-l-oeuvre *2009/2010 : Dal\u00ed d'Or et Bijoux de Gala The Espace Dal\u00ed turns into a jewel box and houses the collection of jewels and gold items designed by Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1960's. Sumptuous pieces illuminate the largest exhibition of works by the Catalan master in France. These jewelry and coins praise the career of the world-renowned artist.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/3/Dali-d- Or-Bijoux-de-Gala *2012 : Sign\u00e9 Dal\u00ed, la collection Sabater Espace Dal\u00ed presents for the first time in France the collection of works offered and autographed by Salvador Dal\u00ed to his friend and Secretary Enrique Sabater. From February 10 to May 10, 2012, the public admired a hundred dedications composed of oils, watercolors, sketches, drawings, models of furniture, photographs that are evidence of the friendship between the Catalan genius and the man who was his secretary for more than twelve years.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/4/Signe-Dali-La- collection-Sabater *2014 : Dal\u00ed fait le mur, 22 artistes street art s'invitent chez Dal\u00ed Polymorphic, explosive, rebel, bewildering, funny, unusual, non- conformist, popular: description of the Dal\u00ednian method or that of the Street Art? Beyond the creative process, what brings these creators close to one another is their unique way of revealing the world: provocative, iconoclastic and wild. Just like Dal\u00ed, street artists are limitless when it comes to their sources of inspiration and convictions, the materiel and the mediums they use. About twenty urban artists have met the challenge. In dialogue with the works exhibited at Espace Dal\u00ed, each of them created an artwork which dares to confront the surrealist universe with the vocabulary and the codes of urban art: painting, stencil, design, light painting, sound and installation.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/1/Dali-fait-le-mur *2015 : Daum, Variations d'Artistes - Who could bring together in the same exhibition the following artists: Arman, Ben, C\u00e9sar, Paella Chimicos, Louis Derbr\u00e9, Etienne, Carlos Mata, Hilton McConnico, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mesnager, Alain S\u00e9chas, Richard Texier\u2026 and Salvador Dal\u00ed? Only Daum can, the famous master glassmaker from Lorraine, partner with artists for over 130 years. In 1968, when the Daum approached the extravagant Salvador Dal\u00ed to ask him to work with crystal, neither one would have imagined that the combination of craftsmanship and art would live on, adding new horizons for the French manufacture that possesses unique French expertise.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/10/Daum-variations-d- artistes == See also == * Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum \u2014 the largest collection of Dal\u00ed's artworks, in Figueres, Spain * Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum \u2014 home to many of Dal\u00ed's large masterwork paintings, in St Petersburg, Florida * Dal\u00ed \u2013 Die Ausstellung am Potsdamer Platz \u2014 museum with permanent exhibition of more than 450 artworks of Salvador Dal\u00ed in Central Berlin, Germany. * Salvador Dal\u00ed House Museum, in Portlligat, Spain * List of museums in Paris ==References== == External links == * * Dal\u00ed Universe website Category:Salvador Dal\u00ed Dali, Salvador Category:Art museums and galleries in Paris Category:Buildings and structures in the 18th arrondissement of Paris Category:Montmartre Dali, Salvador ",
