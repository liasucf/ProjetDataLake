He portrays the emotions of a downtrodden people in elegant words and weaves verses of beautiful human poetry. Hope plays a big part in the poetry of Tanty as he conjures contrasting planes of thought into his works. The plight of the tea gardeners, their lives, a deep sense of longing along with a determined choice to elicit changes in their lives is prominent in verses of Tanty's poetry. His left-wing radicalism and sensitivity made him a voice to be reckoned with. During his time in Jorhat, Sananta Tanty came in contact with many prominent litterateurs of the state, which gave an urge to learn the Assamese language. He began writing for a magazine, then edited by Dr. Nagen Saikia and his penchant for words started gaining him notice. He is also credited with revolutionising the field of modern Assamese poetry and has emerged as an important voice within it. It is his indulgence in life of the ordinary people, prominence of society and politics upon which lies no pretense gives him legitimacy and stokes a romanticism for the working class and culture. He is one of the stalwarts in the state today in the field of literature. == References == == See also == # Category:Indian poets Category:1952 births Category:Living people ",
