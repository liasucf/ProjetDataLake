It was released by Som Livre in 1999, being the last Xuxa studio album, before the series S\u00f3 Para Baixinhos. ==Background and production== In February 1999, it was announced that Xuxa would record a live album during their April tour of the same year. Because of the recordings of the film Requebra, neither the album nor the tour came to fruition. In contrast, the Children's Queen, felt the need to make a more childish album. With the cancellation of the live project, they decided to start producing another studio album. At the request of the present host, hundreds of composers sent their songs to the production of Planeta Xuxa until about 20 songs were selected. Just like in S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea, Xuxa wanted to make a record more aimed at the children's audience, more specifically, an album for her daughter, as she stated in some interviews of the time. The recording of the album began in late June 1999. The album was produced by Michael Sullivan and Z\u00e9 Henrique, had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and artistic coordination Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. At the time, much was said about Nostradamus' prophecy about the world ending in 2000 and the coming of the new millennium. Taking a hitch on the subject, were ordered music with these themes and so were recorded: \"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\", 2000 and \"Aquarius\" (discarded). In addition to tracks with the biggest subject of the time, Xuxa realized in part his desire to record more infantile songs, which are the majority in this album. The songs aimed at the underdogs on this album were nothing more than a test for the project S\u00f3 Para Baixinhos, that the blonde would release the following year. Initially First Anniversary would not be a potpourri, it would only count to the first song and a chorus shouting \"Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!\". This version even touched on the \"Primeiro Anivers\u00e1rio\" of Xuxa's daughter. For the adolescents, \"Vira, Vira\" (Planeta Vira, Vira) that served as theme of the Planeta Xuxa program that year, \"Efeito Domin\u00f3\" e \"S\u00f3 o Nosso Amor\" that served as a trail for the film Requebra, besides the theme song of the film, which was discarded and released in the voice of the composer himself, the singer Vinny. One of the bands that stand out is \"O Bicho Vai Pegar\", the last partnership of the presenter with the composer Cid Guerreiro, the same of \"Ilari\u00ea\". During the song selection phase, the Molejo group composed a song especially for Xuxa. The singer liked \"Pagoxu\" so much that she decided to record for the album. Initially, there would be no talk in the introduction of the pagode, but rather you speak of Xuxa herself after the chorus of the song. While recording an edition of Planeta Xuxa on August 15, 1999, Xuxa and Anderson (vocalist of the group) commented on the song after the blonde showed an excerpt of the result of the song. In this conversation, the idea of the vocalist appeared to record some lines to insert in the introduction, as if it were announcing the arrival of Xuxa. In 1999, Xuxa made his return to the cinema with the film Requebra. Two songs were composed for the feature and soon after included in the album: the pop \"Efeito Domin\u00f3\" and the romantic ballad \"S\u00f3 o Nosso Amor\". The art of Xuxa 2000 is one of the most masterful of Xuxa's entire career. The cover, back cover and the label bring the concept of the end of the world. The photos of the rehearsal for the Spanish album El Mundo \u00e9s de los Dos, which was released that same year, were reused. The inside of the booklet simulated a notebook with many drawings, pencils and photos of the essay done for the album. One of the highlights of the art was a holographic seal with the signature and the Xuxa kissing marque that was glued to the packaging. ==Release== Xuxa 2000 was released in the second half of 1999, the album only had two runs, totaling 100,000 copies sold. The cover and the back cover have a holographic effect, the first print also came with a holographic tag with a kiss marquinha and the signature of Xuxa, he is in the list of those that have not been re-released, among this list are T\u00f4 de Bem com a Vida (1996), Boas Not\u00edcias (1997) and S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea (1998). ==Promotion== Since March 1999, the song \"Vira, Vira (Planeta Vira, Vira)\" was already performed in the Planeta Xuxa program. However, the release of the album only really began in August when Xuxa started to present other songs from the album on the show, as well as performing at Xuxa Park. All the songs were performed on TV, except \"Rap da Xuxa\". In October 1999, the program Xuxa Park begins its new season and begins to have as theme of opening the music \"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\". Already in the first program, Xuxa started a contest where a group of boys and girls should learn the choreography of Dancing the Country, the group that had the best performance would win a bicycle for each member. The promotion was released in a few editions of the Park and soon canceled. In the same month, the Queen of Children performed \"Profecias\" in the show of the campaign Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a (Child Hope). Only two songs from Xuxa 2000 have won clips in their release phase. From December 1999, the music video \"Profecias (Fim do Mundo)\", began to serve as the opening theme of the novel Vila Madalena. In the same month, the music 2000 had its video shown in the Show of Turned on the 31 of December. Taking a ride on Xuxa's return to the movies, the songs \"Efeito Domin\u00f3\" and Only Our Love were included in the soundtrack of the film Requebra. The blonde even gave interviews to some radios promoting the album and her most recent feature. In November 1999, the blonde arrived to participate in the program Show of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos of Radio Globo. The 2000 tour was scheduled for October 1999, including the custom bus that would transport Xuxa and his team was ready, but for unknown reasons the project was canceled. Xuxa only presented songs from this album in a show for children of INCA (Instituto Nacional do C\u00e2ncer), in Rio de Janeiro on August 21, 1999 and in a closed presentation for Rede Globo employees, held at the Globo studios (Rio de Janeiro) on 31 of October of that year. Curiously, the scene of this show was basically the same as the Xuxa 92 tour, but Xuxa was coming down from the white ship used in the last season of Xou da Xuxa. To date, no video record has been found of these shows, just photos. As part of the disclosure, Xuxa would appear in the program Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o on December 12, 1999, but due to a subacute thyroiditis was forced to cancel. Participation in Santa's Arrival in Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro was also canceled and Xuxa was replaced by Eliana. == Track listing == ==Personnel== *Production: Michael Sullivan and Z\u00e9 Henrique *Art Direction: Aramis Barros *Art Coordination: Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel *Recording Technician: Jo\u00e3o Carlos (Joca), S\u00e9rgio Rocha, M\u00e1rio Jorge and Mauro Moraes *Mixing Assistants: Ivan Carvalho, Williams Oliveira, Everaldo Andrade *Vocal Preparation: Angela de Castro *Mixing Technicians: Jorge 'Gordo' Guimar\u00e3es *Studio Assistants (Som Livre): Claudio Oliveira, Ciro Albuquerque, Everaldo and Williams Oliveira *Production assistant: Duda Nogueira *Studio Coordination: H\u00e9lio de Freitas ==References== == External links == * Xuxa 2000 at Discogs Category:1999 albums Category:Xuxa albums Category:Som Livre albums Category:Portuguese-language albums ",
