    "text": "The Communist uprising of 1935 () was a military revolt by leftist low-rank military against Get\u00falio Vargas's government, in the name of the National Liberation Alliance and with the support of the Brazilian Communist Party, which was back then called the Communist Party of Brazil, the uprising also had the support of the Comintern. It was the last of a series of Brazilian military uprisings which began on 1922 under the name of or the lieutenants revolts. Later, Vargas used it as a pretext for the establishment. In 1932, the fascist Brazilian Integralist Action party was created. Later, in March 1935, an organization called the National Liberation Alliance () was created in Brazil, inspired by some popular fronts that emerged in Europe to prevent Nazi-fascist political advance. It argued for nationalist proposals and had as one of its objects to struggle for land reform. Led by nationalists and leftists, it managed to bring together the various sectors of society and quickly became a mass movement. Many military, Catholics, socialists and liberals, most of them disillusioned with the direction of the political process started in 1930, when Get\u00falio Vargas assumed the presidency of the Republic, joined the movement. Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes was chosen as its honorary president due to his prestige, in the left in general, particular with communists and some military while leading revolts during 1920s. Despite the Brazilian Communist Party being declared illegal once again in August 1927, it quickly became the most prominent leftist organization in the country, establishing branches in many different cities and with thousands of supporters. In July 1935, just months after its creation, the ANL was declared illegal by Get\u00falio Vargas. Although the difficulty of mobilization had increased, the ANL still continued organizing rallies and demonstrations and reporting news critical of the government. In August, the organization stepped up preparations for an armed movement aiming at the overthrow of Vargas from power and the installation of a Communist regime headed by Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes. The plan was to start military uprisings in several regions with the support of the working class, which would trigger strikes across the country. The first military uprising broke out on November 23, 1935, in Natal. The next day, another military uprising took place in Recife. On the 27th, a revolt broke out in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the country. Without the support of the working class, and restricted to the three cities, the rebellion was quickly and violently put down. From then on, intense persecution affected not only communists, but also all government opponents. Thousands of people were arrested across the country, including congressmen, senators and even the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Pedro Ernesto Baptista. Despite its failure, the Communist revolt had provided a justification or pretext for assigning more power to Get\u00falio Vargas. After November 1935, the Congress approved a series of laws that restricted its own power, while the executive gained almost unlimited powers of repression. This process culminated in the coup of November 10, 1937, which closed the Congress, canceled the upcoming 1938 presidential elections and made Get\u00falio Vargas rule as a dictator. This period of Vargas dictatorship is called the Estado Novo, which lasted until 1945. == See also == * Vargas Era ==References== Category:1935 in Brazil Category:Communist rebellions Category:Conflicts in 1935 Category:Rebellions in Brazil Category:Vargas Era ",
