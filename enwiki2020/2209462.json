Berlin He interprets his artist name as \"super-intelligentes Drogenopfer\" (super-intelligent drug victim). It used to stand for \"Schei\u00dfe in dein Ohr\" (shit into your ear), a line from his track Terroarr. Sido is currently signed to Urban/Universal Music Group. W\u00fcrdig distinguishes himself by using provocative and aggressive lyrics. After his breakthrough with his debut album Maske in 2004, W\u00fcrdig was always seen wearing a silver skull mask. However, as stated in various interviews, since 2005 he no longer wears the mask, having handed it to his former boss Specter. W\u00fcrdig's career began in 1997, as one half of duo Royal TS (now A.i.d.S) with B-Tight, both of whom were later signed to the label Berlin hip hop Royal Bunker and then to Aggro Berlin in 2001. As of 2009 Sido is signed to Universal Music Group. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Paul W\u00fcrdig was born to a German father and a Sinti mother. W\u00fcrdig stated in an interview with the radio station BigFM that he's one-eighth Iranian . At the age of eight years Sido and his younger sister were brought up by their mother in East Berlin in the Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood. In 1988, the family moved to West Berlin, where they first lived in emergency accommodation in Wedding along with many asylum seekers. They then moved into M\u00e4rkisches Viertel, a high-rise residential area in the Berlin borough of Reinickendorf. During his childhood and youth, M\u00e4rkisches Viertel had a high proportion of migrants and low-income families. There he attended the Bettina-von-Arnim-Oberschule and afterwards began an apprenticeship as an educator, which he never completed. ==Career== ===1997\u20132002: Early career=== Sido has been active in the music business since 1997. Together with his best friend B-Tight he released several EPs and demos under the name Royal TS, which were never officially published, at the Berlin underground hip hop label Royal Bunker. SIDO had been friends with DJ Tomekk for a long time. The two made a dubplate from Arschficksong and DJ Tomekk played them in clubs all over Germany, presenting SIDO to a wider audience for the first time. Specter was Art Director for DJ Tomekk at that time. At a concert the duo got the attention of Halil, Specter and Spaiche - the later founders of the Aggro Berlin label. https://www.redbull.com/de- de/specter-aggro-berlin-interview DJ Tomekk paved SIDO and Specter their way to success redbull.com, Author: Ralf Theil, 5.

In 2004, Sido's debut album Maske was released, reaching #3 on the German charts and selling more than 180,000 copies to date, achieving gold status. The lead single \"Mein Block\" (My block) reached #13 on the German charts, the second single \"Fuffies im Club\" (\u20ac50 notes in the club) reached #18 and the third single \"Mama ist stolz\" (Mum is proud) reached #25.:de:Maske (Album)#Titelliste The original album was indexed because of the song \"Endlich Wochenende\" (\"Finally weekend\") which, according to the BPjM, glorified the use of drugs. The album was rereleased under the name \"Maske X\" with the song \"Arschficksong\" in replacement of \"Endlich Wochenende\". The song was also published (with the video slightly censored), for the first time as a single. In September of the same year, he won a prestigious German music award for \"Best Newcomer.\" The best-known song from that album, \"Mein Block\", describes life from a resident's perspective in the M\u00e4rkisches Viertel, a low-income neighborhood of Berlin, detailing the narcotics trade, alcoholism, problems with police, and poverty in Sido's Block, or building. ===2005\u20132006: Other projects and Ich=== After this debut album, together with his Label colleagues B-Tight and Fler, he released two label samplers: Aggro Ansage Nr. 4 and Aggro Ansage Nr. 5 (which featured the new label artists Tony D and G-Hot). In 2005, Sido performed with and represented Berlin in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005 with the song \"Mama ist stolz\", placing 3rd with 113 points. Later he collaborated with rapper Harris, as the rap duo Deine Lieblings Rapper (\"Your favourite rappers\"). In 2005, they released their debut album Dein Lieblings Album (\"Your favourite album\"), with \"Steh wieder auf\" (get up again) as the only single. In December 2006, Sido released his second album Ich, which reached #4 in the German album charts. Three singles: \"Strassenjunge\", \"Ein Teil von mir\" and \"Schlechtes Vorbild\" were released. The album achieved gold status. ===2007: Sektenmusik=== 2007 Sido and B-Tight (alias A.i.d.S. (=Alles ist die Sekte, engl.

The singles \"Augen auf\"/Halt dein Maul\", \"Carmen\", \"Herz\", \"Nein!\" and \"Beweg dein Arsch\" had success in the charts. On August 2008, Sido joined the seventh season of Popstars, called \"Just 4 Girls\", as a jury member, along with Detlef D! Soost and Loona. Many people were surprised, wondering why Sido, the Aggro-rapper with his provocative and aggressive lyrics, would join a TV show like Popstars? At the end of Popstars the band Queensberry was formed. ===2009: Aggro Berlin=== On 1 April 2009, the label Aggro Berlin was closed. Sido was then signed by Urban Records, a division of Universal Music Germany. On October, 30th 2009 Sido released his fourth studio album Aggro Berlin.
