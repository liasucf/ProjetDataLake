    "text": "H\u00f6n\u00f6kaka (English: H\u00f6n\u00f6 bread or H\u00f6n\u00f6 cake) is a type of Swedish flat soft white pricked bread. It is named after the island town H\u00f6n\u00f6 in Gothenburg's northern archipelago, and was originally baked by the people living on said archipelago's different islands. The bread is baked in round flat pieces, but is normally sold as half-circles. In 2014, industrially made h\u00f6n\u00f6kaka was produced by two manufactures, \u00c5kes \u00c4kta H\u00f6n\u00f6kakor and P\u00e5gen. \u00c5ke \"Grytens- Karl\" Johannesson began his bakery business on H\u00f6n\u00f6 in 1934, and moved his operations to Torslanda in 1960. H\u00f6n\u00f6kaka was stored in the same way as crispbread. The bread was baked on H\u00f6n\u00f6 by the area's fishing and farming families. The flat bread was easy to both store and eat during fishing trips on the sea. Just as with crispbread, the h\u00f6n\u00f6kaka was holed so that they could be hung from the rafters on poles. The bread was stored for a long time and was often eaten even after it gone stale and hard. Homemade h\u00f6n\u00f6kaka is usually slightly firmer than industrially baked. == References == Category:Swedish breads ",
