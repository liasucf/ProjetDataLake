    "text": "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos is the fifth studio album by English industrial rock band Pop Will Eat Itself. It was released on 19 September 1994 in the United Kingdom by Infectious Records and in the United States by Nothing and Interscope Records. The album is somewhat different from the band's other albums, as it had more of an industrial influence and fewer samples were used. The cover art was created by longtime collaborators The Designers Republic. It was followed by an album of remixes, Two Fingers My Friends!, which is the English translation of \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\". ==Reception== Record Collector said it was \"arguably their best\" album, adding that several songs on their later album Anti-Nasty League (2015) \"credibly hark back to the Poppies at their hard-hitting, Dos Dedos-era best.\"Anti Nasty League \u2013 Record Collector Magazine ==Track listing== #\"Ich Bin Ein Auslander\" (Clint Mansell, Pance) \u2013 3:59 #\"Kick to Kill\" (Crabb) \u2013 3:24 #\"Familus Horribilus\" (Townshend, Crabb) \u2013 4:03 #\"Underbelly\" (Mansell, Pance) \u2013 3:58 #\"Fatman\" (Mansell, Pance) \u2013 3:17 #\"Home\" (Townshend, Crabb) \u2013 3:36 #\"Cape Connection\" (Crabb) \u2013 4:59 #\"Menofearthereaper\" (Crabb) \u2013 6:27 #\"Everything's Cool\" (Mansell, Pance) \u2013 4:17 #\"R.S.V.P.\" (Crabb) \u2013 3:32 #\"Babylon\" (Crabb) \u2013 5:04 ;Japanese edition bonus tracks # * \"Intense\" #\"C.P.
