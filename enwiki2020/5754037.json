It is centered on the intersection known as the Five Points consisting of Quincy Street, Military Road, and Old Dominion Road being bisected by Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29). Located in the community is the H-B Woodlawn school. One of the oldest nonresidential structures in the community is the Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919 to serve as the home of the Cherrydale Volunteer Fire Department. The department supplements the career staff who operate from the Arlington County Fire Department's Station 3, now located west of the Five Points intersection. ==History== 100 px In 1893, a branch post office at Lee Highway and Pollard Street was named Cherrydale, with reference to Dorsey Donaldson's large cherry orchard in back of the present firehouse. Quincy Street was then known as Cherry Valley Road. Settlement in this area began after the Civil War and was stimulated in 1906 by the establishment of The Great Falls and Old Dominion Railway Line. Abandoned in 1935, the track bed became Old Dominion Drive. Military Road was cut through broken and densely wooded country by Army Engineers in 1861 to connect the isolated defensive works at Chain Bridge (Forts Marcy and Ethan Allen) with the Arlington Line.Taken from the \"Cherrydale\" historical sign located in front of the Cherrydale Library ==References== Cherrydale Library == External links == *Cherrydale Citizens Association *Cherrydale Housing Market Trends *Our Neighborhoods - Cherrydale Arlington County Page Category:Neighborhoods in Arlington County, Virginia ",
