WBNS (AM) experimented with FM as early as 1940 with station W8XVH, which became W45CM and later WELD, but took the station off the air in the early 1950s. The modern-day station debuted as WBNS-FM in 1957, and in 1970 began airing a music format. In the mid-1970s, an Easy Listening music format was adopted. In November 1991 the station moved from Easy Listening, to Oldies, and the station became \"Oldies B-97.1\". Almost ten years later, in July 2001, WBNS-FM moved to Modern AC as \"The New 97.1\", with a mix of pop alternative music. Eventually, the station evolved with a Hot AC format as \"97.1-More Music, More Variety.\" In August 2005, the station adopted the Hot AC-friendly \"Mix\" name and became \"Mix 97.1-80s, 90s, Now.\" ==Conversion to sports format== On January 26, 2009, at 2 PM, the station began a simulcast of AM sister station WBNS (\"1460 The Fan\"), airing a sports format, as 97.1 The Fan.
