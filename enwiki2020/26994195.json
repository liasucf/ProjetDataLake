    "text": "In enzyme kinetics, a secondary plot uses the intercept or slope from several Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots to find additional kinetic constants.A. Cornish-Bowden. Fundamentals of Enzyme kinetics Rev. ed., Portland: London, England, (1995) pp. 30-37, 56-57.J. N. Rodriguez-Lopez, M. A. Gilabert, J. Tudela, R. N. F. Thorneley, and F. Garcia-Canovas. Biochemistry, 2000, 39, 13201-13209. For example, when a set of v by [S] curves from an enzyme with a ping\u2013pong mechanism (varying substrate A, fixed substrate B) are plotted in a Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot, a set of parallel lines will be produced. The following Michaelis\u2013Menten equation relates the initial reaction rate v0 to the substrate concentrations [A] and [B]: : \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{v_0} &= \\frac{ K_M^A}{v_\\max {[}A{]}}+\\frac{ K_M^B}{v_\\max {[}B{]}}+\\frac{1}{v_\\max} \\end{align} The y-intercept of this equation is equal to the following: : \\begin{align} \\mbox{y-intercept} = \\frac{ K_M^B}{v_\\max {[}B{]}}+\\frac{1}{v_\\max} \\end{align} The y-intercept is determined at several different fixed concentrations of substrate B (and varying substrate A). The y-intercept values are then plotted versus 1/[B] to determine the Michaelis constant for substrate B, K_M^B, as shown in the Figure to the right.The Horseradish Peroxidase/ o-Phenylenediamine (HRP/OPD) System Exhibits a Two-Step Mechanism. M. K. Tiama and T. M. Hamilton, Journal of Undergraduate Chemistry Research, 4, 1 (2005). The slope is equal to K_M^B divided by v_\\max and the intercept is equal to 1 over v_\\max. Secondary Plot of enzyme system Horseradish Peroxidase and o-Phenylenediamine (with hydrogen peroxide as the second substrate) ==Secondary plot in inhibition studies== A secondary plot may also be used to find a specific inhbition constant, KI. For a competitive enzyme inhibitor, the apparent Michaelis constant is equal to the following: : \\begin{align} \\mbox{apparent } K_m=K_m\\times \\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_I}\\right) \\end{align} The slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plot is therefore equal to: : \\begin{align} \\mbox{slope} =\\frac{K_m}{v_\\max}\\times \\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_I}\\right) \\end{align} If one creates a secondary plot consisting of the slope values from several Lineweaver-Burk plots of varying inhibitor concentration [I], the competitive inhbition constant may be found. The slope of the secondary plot divided by the intercept is equal to 1/KI. This method allows one to find the KI constant, even when the Michaelis constant and vmax values are not known. == References == Category:Enzyme kinetics ",
