The march took place in Washington, D.C. and drew thousands of protestors, including tennis legend Martina Navratilova. The crowd marched down Pennsylvania Avenue from a starting point near the Trump International Hotel and ended at the U.S. Capitol. The march was advertised as an event to remind elected officials that they work for the people. According to march organizer Amy Siskind, \"The members of Congress and especially (Speaker of the House) Nancy Pelosi need to feel the pressure to hold the Trump regime accountable. They have failed at that.\" Siskind, who is well known for publishing The Weekly List, a chronicle of what she calls the \"not normal\" events happening under the Trump administration, came up with the idea for the march over the summer after realizing that there was \"a broad sense of frustration\u201d among voters following the midterm elections in November 2018. \u201cI got the feeling that people wanted to do something. They wanted to take to the streets and march.\"https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/09/19/amy-siskind-we-the-people-march- interview-donald-trump/ https://spectator.us/media-forgotten- protest/https://www.thedailybeast.com/hongkongers-are-fighting-for-democracy- will-americanshttps://www.observertoday.com/news/local-region/2019/09/we-the- people-solidarity-march-to-be-held-saturday-in-dunkirk/ While the march had a broad mission statement, participants organized around a number of specific issues, including gun legislation and calls for impeachment.
