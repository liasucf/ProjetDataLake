    "text": "S\u00e9cheresses (Drought), FP 90, is a cantata by Francis Poulenc for mixed choir (SATB) composed in 1937 on poems by Edward James who commissioned it. It was regarded as a failure when it was premiered in 1938, but a great success when it was performed again in 1953. == History == It was the British poet Edward James who commissioned this work from the composer. Edward James (1907\u20131984) was also a rich patron of the arts, a friend of painters such as Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Leonor Fini, but also of musicians such as the conductor Igor Markevitch. He offered Francis Poulenc twice the sum that Winnaretta Singer had paid for Poulenc's Organ Concerto.Benjamin Ivry, Francis Poulenc, Phaidon Press, 1996, (p. 201). Francis Poulenc composed this cantata on four texts by Edward James between September and December 1937.S\u00e9cheresses. FP 90 on the site of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France. Two of the texts used had been published in the journal of surrealist inspiration Minotaure.Carl B. Schmidt, The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899\u20131963): A Catalogue, Clarendon Press, 1995, (p. 23). The composer dedicated his work to Yvonne de Casa Fuerte, a violinist who had married the Marquis of Casa Fuerte. The work was premiered at salle Pleyel in Paris on 2 April 1938 by the Concerts Colonne orchestra and the singers of Lyon under the direction of Paul Paray. This first performance was a failure with the audience, and the composer wanted to destroy the score of his work, but Georges Auric dissuaded him.Renaud Machart, Poulenc, Paris, \u00e9ditions du Seuil, (p. 111).Roland Duclos, \"Le singulier pluriel de S\u00e9cheresses de Poulenc\", Forum Op\u00e9ra, 4 March 2015. S\u00e9cheresses was played again much later, on 28 September 1953, by the Paris Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Bigot, and on 4 November 1953 at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es by the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des concerts du Conservatoire under the direction of Georges Tzipine. The work was then a great success.Carl B.
