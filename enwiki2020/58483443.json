    "text": "The Monaghan Intermediate Football Championship (often referred to as the Monaghan IFC for short or the McElvaney's Waste & Recycling Intermediate Football Championship for sponsorship reasons) is the second-tier championship organised by Monaghan GAA. Each year, the winner of the Championship is promoted, along with the Monaghan Intermediate Football League (IFL) winners, to the Senior ranks and compete in the following year's Monaghan Senior Football Championship. There is no relegation from the IFC, with the two lowest finishing teams in the IFL are relegated to the Junior ranks for the following year. The winners of the Championship receive the Paddy O'Rourke Cup, named after the Inniskeen Grattans clubman who served in various positions within club and county boards. The winners of the Championship progress to the Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship. ==Format== The competition uses a double-elimination format up until the semi-final stage, which is knockout. Ten teams enter the competition, with four teams drawn into the Preliminary Round and the remaining six teams into Round 1A. The winners of the Preliminary Round game play each other in Round 1A, making up the fourth game in that round. The four winners in Round 1A then progress to Round 2A. At this stage, the four teams are drawn in two matches, with the two winners progressing to the Semi-Final stage. The losers enter the 'back-door' route, with the two Preliminary Round losers, and three of the four Round 1A losers entering Round 1B. As five teams are eligible for Round 1B, one team receives a bye to Round 2B, with the remaining four teams drawn in two matches. The two winners of the Round 1B games progress to Round 2B, and joining them in Round 2B is the loser of the Round 1A clash involving the Preliminary Round winners. At this stage, again, the four teams are drawn in two matches with the two winners progressing to Round 3, where they face the losers of the Round 2A games. In Round 3, the four teams are drawn in two matches, with the two winners progressing to the Semi-Final stage. ==Roll of Honour== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center; width: 100%;\" |- !width=\"5%\"| !width=\"25%\"|Team !width=\"10%\"|Winners !width=\"25%\"|Years !width=\"10%\"|Runner-up !width=\"25%\"|Years |- | 1 | border Doohamlet O'Neills | 4 | 2018, 2015, 2012, 2010 | | |- | 2 | border Carrickmacross Emmets | 2 | 2017, 2011 | 1 | 2015 |- | 3 | border Tyholland | 1 | 2008 | 3 | 2013, 2012, 2010 |- | 4 | border Donaghmoyne Fontenoys | 1 | 2016 | 1 | 2014 |- | =5 | border Inniskeen Grattans | 1 | 2014 | | |- | =5 | border Truagh Gaels | 1 | 2013 | | |- | =5 | border Monaghan Harps | 1 | 2009 | | |- | | border Sean McDermotts | | | 1 | 2018 |- | | border Aughnamullen Sarsfields | | | 1 | 2017 |- | | border Rockcorry | | | 1 | 2016 |- | | border Corduff Gaels | | | 1 | 2011 |- | | border Drumhowan | | | 1 | 2009 |- |} ==List of Finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center; width: 100%;\" |- !width=\"5%\"|Year !width=\"14%\"|Winner !width=\"10%\"|Score !width=\"14%\"|Runner-up !width=\"10%\"|Venue |- | 2018 | Doohamlet O'Neills border | 0-09 - 0-08 | border Sean McDermotts | Clontibret |- | 2017 | Carrickmacross Emmets border | 3-12 - 1-08 | border Aughnamullen Sarsfields | Inniskeen |- | 2016 | Donaghmoyne Fontenoys border | 0-10 - 1-06 | border Rockcorry | Clontibret |- | 2015 | Doohamlet O'Neills border | 1-11 - 0-12 |border Carrickmacross Emmets | Castleblayney |- | 2014 | Inniskeen Grattans border | 0-11 - 1-07 | border Donaghmoyne Fontenoys | Clontibret |- | 2013 | Truagh Gaels border | 1-14 - 1-11 | border Tyholland | Clontibret |- | 2012 | Doohamlet O'Neills border | 0-12 - 1-08 | border Tyholland | Clontibret |- | 2011 | Carrickmacross Emmets border | 1-11 - 1-07 | border Corduff Gaels | Clontibret |- | 2010 | Doohamlet O'Neills border | 3-09 - 1-06 | border Tyholland | Clontibret |- | 2009 | Monaghan Harps border | 1-10 - 0-10 | border Drumhowan | Clontibret |- | 2008 | Tyholland border | | | |- | 2007 | | | | |- | 2006 | | | | |- | 2005 | | | | |- | 2004 | | | | |- | 2003 | | | | |- | 2002 | | | | |- | 2001 | | | | |- | 2000 | | | | |- |} ==References== ==External links== Category:Monaghan GAA club championships Category:Intermediate Gaelic football county championships ",
