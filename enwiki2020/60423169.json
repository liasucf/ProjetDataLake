Little Temple is situated in the Bow River Valley between Paradise Creek and Moraine Creek, south of Lake Louise, Alberta. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway along with its nearest higher peak, Mount Temple, to the southwest. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Little Temple is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Little Temple is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below -30 \u00b0C.
