In 1957, his single \u201cPlaything\u201d was released on Rev Records and reached No. 45 on the Billboard Top 100. The same year he made two appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. In January, 2009 The Associated Press selected Newman's poem \"Plea to the Pres\" as a winner in their poetry contest regarding the inauguration of President Barack Obama. In 2012, the Arizona Historical Society named him as one of 100 Arizona Culture Keepers for the Arizona Centennial celebration. == Early life == Newman was born in South Dakota, spent much of his childhood in Wyoming, and then moved to Arizona. He attended Holbrook High School for three years and then moved to Phoenix, Arizona where he attended North Phoenix High School. He played quarterback at Holbrook, and was a celebrated fullback for North Phoenix High. He also performed and sang baritone solos for his high school's A Cappella Choir. In 1957, The Arizona Republic reported that he was voted Most Outstanding Senior (male) at his high school. == Recording success == While still in high school, Newman got his start in the music business recording a few jingles for local commercials.The Phoenix Sound: A History of Twang & Rockabilly Music in Arizona. Jim West During his senior year he recorded the single \"Plaything\" (written by Henry and Samuel Underwood) b/w \"Unlucky Me\" (written by Connie Conway) with Rev Records at Ramsey's Recording Studio (later Audio Recorders). The single sold 20,000 copies in the first ten days. After two and a half weeks it sold 100,000 copies, and eventually over 250,000 copies were purchased. In 1957, \"Plaything\" peaked at No. 45 on the Billboard Top 100. Building on his chart success, Newman performed on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Guy Mitchell Show, and The Milt Grant Show.

While at ASU, Newman was part of a folk-song trio, the Balladeers, with fellow singers John Southern and Toby Constance. In 1960, Newman and two fellow ASU students decided to tour the world with their stringed instruments. Newman sold one of his guitars and an amplifier to help fund their six-month trip. Newman played guitar, John Southern played the banjo, and Ron Iverson provided vocals. They started out with $160 cash and paid for their rest of their travel expenses by performing and finding money-making opportunities along the way. While in Spain, he recorded an album which made 17,400 pesetas, which was equal to about . He also spent a week working as a coal miner in Cologne, Germany.
