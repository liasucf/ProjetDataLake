Bowling Green won the Fall D1AA Rugby National Championship in 2018, beating Saint Joseph\u2019s University 26-7. The win capped off the 50th anniversary season of BGSU Rugby. ==Pageantry== Before 1927, BG teams were called the Normals or Teachers. Ivan Lake (\u201923) suggested the nickname after reading an article on falconry. Lake, managing editor and sports editor of the Sentinel-Tribune in Bowling Green at the time, proposed the name change because it fit headline space and because falcons were \"the most powerful bird for their size and often attacked birds two or three times their size.\" Bowling Green's athletic teams have been known as the \"Falcons\" ever since. ===School colors=== The historical story behind how BGSU began using brown and orange as its school colors dates back to 1914. Homer B. Williams, the university's first President, gathered a group of people which included a L.L. Winslow from Industrial Arts as a selection committee for the school's new colors. While on a trolley to Toledo, Dr. Winslow sat behind a woman wearing a large hat adorned with beautiful brown and orange feathers. Dr. Winslow was so interested in the color scheme of the pair that he convinced the committee to approve the combination of brown and orange. ===School songs=== Bowling Green State University has three common songs that can be heard being played by the Falcon Marching Band at various athletic and academic events. These three songs are the Alma Mater, \"Forward Falcons\" which is the school's fight song, and \"Ay Ziggy Zoomba\" which is played to hype up the crowd at events, which is more familiar to most students, alumni, and fans. ===Mascots=== Freddie and Frieda Falcon are the mascots for Falcons athletics. The pair are anthropomorphized peregrine falcons. They are somewhat of a rarity among collegiate mascots, being one of the few male-female mascot pairs in existence. In 2006 they were both named \"Best Collegiate Mascot\" at the 2006 NCA Cheer Camp in Nashville, Tennessee at Vanderbilt University. Freddie first appeared at Bowling Green sporting events in 1950. Frieda made her first appearance in 1966, but did not become an official mascot until 1980. ===SICSIC=== A member of SICSIC SICSIC are a six-member, anonymous pep squad and the official spirit crew for BGSU, which began in 1946. SICSIC members adorn Halloween masks throughout their time with the organization and remain anonymous until the final home hockey game of the member's senior year, where they are unmasked in front of the student body. ===BGSU Athletic Hall of Fame=== Any former BG student-athlete out of school for at least 10 years, a coach, or a contributor to BGSU athletics is eligible for induction into the BGSU Athletic Hall of Fame. Athletes who leave school early are not eligible to be placed on the ballot until 10 years after what would have been their senior year. Portraits of each of the over nearly 200 inductees are on display in the lobby of the BGSU Stroh Center. BG's 1984 NCAA championship squad was inducted in 1993 as the first \"team\" ever named to the Hall of Fame. ==References== ==External links== * ",
