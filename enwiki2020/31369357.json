    "text": "The 1973 U.S. Women's Open was the 28th U.S. Women's Open, held July 19\u201322 at the Country Club of Rochester in Rochester, New York. Defending champion Susie Berning won the third of her three U.S. Women's Open titles, five strokes ahead of runners-up Gloria Ehret and Shelley Hamlin. After a three-under 69 in the third round, Berning was the co-leader with Pam Higgins, two strokes ahead of 36-hole leader Sharon Miller. Berning was the third of seven to successfully defend the championship, following Mickey Wright in 1959 and Donna Caponi in 1970; it was the last of her four major titles. The championship was held at the course twenty years earlier in 1953, the first Women's Open conducted by the United States Golf Association (USGA). It was the second consecutive Women's Open played in the state of New York; the 1972 edition was at Winged Foot in Mamaroneck. ==Past champions in the field== ===Made the cut=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Susie Berning || align=left| || 1968, 1972 || 72 || 77 || 69 || 72 || 290 || +2 || 1 |- |align=left|Mary Mills || align=left| || 1963 || 74 || 73 || 75 || 76 || 298 || +10 || T6 |- | align=left|Sandra Spuzich || align=left| || 1966 || 75 || 79 || 74 || 72 || 300 || +12 || T12 |- | align=left|Murle Breer || align=left| || 1962 || 76 || 75 || 75 || 76 || 302 || +14 || T17 |- | align=left|Kathy Cornelius || align=left| || 1956 || 74 || 77 || 76 || 75 || 302 || +14 || T17 |- | align=left|Donna Caponi Young || align=left| || 1969, 1970 || 78 || 73 || 76 || 77 || 304 || +16 || T25 |- |align=left|JoAnne Carner || align=left| || 1971 || 75 || 75 || 82 || 80 || 312 || +24 || T48 |- | align=left|Betsy Rawls || align=left| || 1951, 1953, 1957, 1960 || 71 || 82 || 84 || 76 || 313 || +25 || T52 |} Source: ===Missed the cut=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year won || R1 || R2 || Total || To par |- | align=left|Patty Berg || align=left| || 1946 || 76 || || || |- | align=left|Carol Mann || align=left| || 1965 || 79 || || || |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Sunday, July 22, 1973 {| class=\"wikitable\" !
