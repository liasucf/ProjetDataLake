    "text": "|} The Lightning Novices' Chase is a Grade 2 National Hunt steeplechase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of about 2 miles and half a furlong (2 miles and 78 yards, or 3,290 metres), and during its running there are twelve fences to be jumped. The race is for novice chasers, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late January or early February. The race was first run in 1979 and was formerly held at Ascot, contested over a distance of 2 miles. It was switched to alternative venues for a three-year period beginning in 2005, and it returned to Ascot with a distance of 2 miles and 1 furlong in 2008. The race was transferred to Doncaster in 2010, and at the same time its length was cut by 110 yards. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"36px\" | Year ! width=\"160px\" | Winner ! width=\"40px\" | Age ! width=\"180px\" | Jockey ! width=\"180px\" | Trainer |- |1979||Dramatist||8||Bill Smith||Fulke Walwyn |- |1980||Beacon Light||9||Bob Turnell||Andy Turnell |- |1981||Double Bluff||8||John Francome||Fred Winter |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1982Abandoned because of snow |- |1983||Starfen||7||Tim Easterby||Peter Easterby |- |1984||Norton Cross||6||Alan Brown ||Peter Easterby |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1985| Abandoned because of snow and frost |- |1986||Pearlyman||7||Paul Barton||John Edwards |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1987| Abandoned because of snow and frost |- | 1988 | Saffron Lord | 6 | Richard Rowe | Josh Gifford |- | 1989 | Sabin du Loir | 10 | Peter Scudamore | Martin Pipe |- | 1990 | Cashew King | 7 | Trevor Wall | Bryan McMahon |- | 1991 | Uncle Ernie | 6 | Mark Dwyer | Jimmy FitzGerald |- | 1992 | Deep Sensation | 7 | Declan Murphy | Josh Gifford |- | 1993 | Valiant Boy | 7 | Russ Garritty | Steve Kettlewell |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" | 1994| Abandoned due to waterlogged state of course |- | 1995 | Gales Cavalier | 7 | Mark Dwyer | David Gandolfo |- | 1996 | Certainly Strong | 6 | Adrian Maguire | David Nicholson |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" | 1997| Abandoned due to frost |- | 1998 | Wade Road | 7 | Jason Titley | Henrietta Knight |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" | 1999| Abandoned due to fog |- | 2000 | Bellator | 7 | Norman Williamson | Venetia Williams |- | 2001 | Exit to Wave | 5 | Norman Williamson | Paul Nicholls |- | 2002 | Il'Athou | 6 | Henry Oliver | Simon Sherwood |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" | 2003 | no race 2003 || || || | |- | 2004 | Bal de Nuit | 5 | Ruby Walsh | Paul Nicholls |- | 2005 | My Will | 5 | Ruby Walsh | Paul Nicholls |- | 2006 | Foreman | 8 | Tony McCoy | Thierry Doumen |- | 2007 | Another Promise | 8 | Graham Lee | Ferdy Murphy |- | 2008 | Wee Robbie | 8 | Noel Fehily | Nick Gifford |- | 2009 | Panjo Bere | 6 | Jamie Moore | Gary L.
