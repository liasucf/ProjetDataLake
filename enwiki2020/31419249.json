El Huehuent\u00f3n is located at about a 30-minute drive from Lagunillas, the largest population enclaved in the forest, between the municipalities of San Mart\u00edn de Hidalgo and Tecolotl\u00e1n, in Jalisco. It is not known why the mount got its peculiar name meaning \"little old man\", although the Tepenahuales, who spoke Nahuatl, inhabited the area since the 15th century. ==References== Category:Landforms of Jalisco Huehuenton ",
