    "text": "The Biggs-Smith graph, the largest 3-regular distance-transitive graph. In the mathematical field of graph theory, a distance-transitive graph is a graph such that, given any two vertices v and w at any distance i, and any other two vertices x and y at the same distance, there is an automorphism of the graph that carries v to x and w to y. Distance-transitive graphs were first defined in 1971 by Norman L. Biggs and D. H. Smith. A distance-transitive graph is interesting partly because it has a large automorphism group. Some interesting finite groups are the automorphism groups of distance-transitive graphs, especially of those whose diameter is 2\\. == Examples == Some first examples of families of distance-transitive graphs include: * The Johnson graphs. * The Grassmann graphs. * The Hamming Graphs. * The folded cube graphs. * The square rook's graphs. * The hypercube graphs. * The Livingstone graph. == Classification of cubic distance-transitive graphs == After introducing them in 1971, Biggs and Smith showed that there are only 12 finite trivalent distance-transitive graphs. These are: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! Graph name ! Vertex count ! Diameter ! Girth ! Intersection array |- | complete graph K4 || 4 || 1 || 3 || {3;1} |- | complete bipartite graph K3,3 || 6 || 2 || 4 || {3,2;1,3} |- | Petersen graph || 10 || 2 || 5 || {3,2;1,1} |- | Graph of the cube || 8 || 3 || 4 || {3,2,1;1,2,3} |- | Heawood graph || 14 || 3 || 6 || {3,2,2;1,1,3} |- | Pappus graph || 18 || 4 || 6 || {3,2,2,1;1,1,2,3} |- | Coxeter graph || 28 || 4 || 7 || {3,2,2,1;1,1,1,2} |- | Tutte\u2013Coxeter graph || 30 || 4 || 8 || {3,2,2,2;1,1,1,3} |- | Graph of the dodecahedron || 20 || 5 || 5 || {3,2,1,1,1;1,1,1,2,3} |- | Desargues graph || 20 || 5 || 6 || {3,2,2,1,1;1,1,2,2,3} |- | Biggs-Smith graph || 102 || 7 || 9 || {3,2,2,2,1,1,1;1,1,1,1,1,1,3} |- | Foster graph || 90 || 8 || 10 || {3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1;1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3} |} == Relation to distance-regular graphs == Every distance-transitive graph is distance-regular, but the converse is not necessarily true. In 1969, before publication of the Biggs\u2013Smith definition, a Russian group led by Georgy Adelson-Velsky showed that there exist graphs that are distance-regular but not distance-transitive. The only graph of this type with degree three is the 126-vertex Tutte 12-cage. The smallest distance- regular graph that is not distance-transitive is the Shrikhande graph. Complete lists of distance-transitive graphs are known for some degrees larger than three, but the classification of distance-transitive graphs with arbitrarily large vertex degree remains open. ==References== ;Early works *. *. *. *. *. ;Surveys *, chapter 20. *. *, chapter 7. *. *, section 4.5. *. ==External links== * Category:Algebraic graph theory Category:Graph families Category:Regular graphs ",
