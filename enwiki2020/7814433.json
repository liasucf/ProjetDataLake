    "text": "\"Loves Me Not\" was a planned fourth single for the album Dangerous and Moving by t.A.T.u. However, due to the group leaving Universal Records, the song's release was postponed, then later cancelled in all countries, except for a limited release in France. Even though it was cancelled, it is available on some countries' iTunes Music Store with only the original song. A video of the group performing the song at \"Glam As You\" in Paris was aired on a few television stations worldwide. Music and lyrics by Andy Kubiszewski and Ed Buller. Cover photo taken by Bryan Adams. Although the song was first seen on Dangerous and Moving, it is considered the only single from The Best.
