    "text": "Sanctuary Housing is a large housing association based in Worcester. It is part of the Sanctuary Group. It manages 250,000 properties in the United Kingdom. It is using a \u00a33.4 million grant from the Scottish Government to finance housing developments in Paisley, Renfrewshire. It runs a supported living operation for more than 500 people with learning disabilities. == Controversies == === Racism === In 2020, Sanctuary was accused of treating a black woman, Selma Nicholls (the CEO of a talent agency) unfairly compared with her white neighbour. Nicholls was refused a temporary rent freeze which she requested due to financial difficulties, while her white neighbour (requesting this under the same circumstances, for an identical property) was allowed one. Compared to her neighbour, Nicholls suffered a compounded loss of approximately \u00a330,000 as a result. === Management and housing standards === It was the subject of a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary in March 2019 in which tenants complained about various issues including damp, woodworm and flooding. The Regulator of Social Housing is said to have found no breaches of their standards. It was attacked in the House of Commons in July 2019 by Mark Francois MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, who said it was \u2018highly dysfunctional\u2019 and had \u201cconsistently provided a poor maintenance service to many of my constituents over a period of many years\u201d. Shortly after this Rochford District Council, which is Conservative controlled, issued a joint statement with the association in which it said it had worked \u201csuccessfully\u201d with the association for 12 years. == References == Category:Housing associations based in England Category:Public housing in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in Worcestershire ",
