The current Chief of the General Police Inspectorate is currently Vadim Cojocaru.http://politia.md/ro/content/cojocaru-vadim == History == The IGP was established as the Police of the Republic of Moldova on 13 September 1990, after the Government of Moldova adopted resolution no. 321 \"On the reform of the bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moldovan SSR\", which provided for the creation of the police and district police stations. Thus, the place of the Soviet-era militia was occupied by the new police. On 18 December 1990, the Parliament of Moldova adopted the Law on police. In 1995 the national police of Moldova were under the direction of the Ministry of Interior. Internal troops were reported to have 2,500 men, and the numbers of riot police were put at 900. The scope and quality of Moldova's state security apparatus were difficult to determine. Like the armed forces, local assets of the former Moldavian KGB were transferred to the new government along with those personnel who wished to enter the service of the new government. These elements functioned at the time under the republic's Ministry of National Security before being transferred to the MAI. On 27 December 2012, a law which entered into force on 5 March 2013 established the General Police Inspectorate under the MAI.Buletin informativ IGP \u2013 edi\u021bie special\u0103 On 24 April 2013, the new police uniform was approved.

The parade dress is worn during the participation in the festivities (taking the oath, awarding of ministerial and departmental distinctions, march pasts, national holidays, and official receptions).http://politia.md/ro/content/tinuta-de-serviciu == Controversial issues == === Public perception === The common lack of respect towards law, in general, among Moldovans results in a predominant distrust for police. This is not helped by the fact that police incompetency due to various reasons is frequent. === Ill-treatment by police === Mounted Moldovan police in a park. Torture and ill-treatment in Moldova remain widespread and systemic despite some initial legislative steps made by the government to change police practices in order to eradicate it, Amnesty International said in October 2007. \"Although efforts have been made to bring legislation into line with international and European standards, practice and attitudes are lagging behind. Beatings and abuse of detainees remain the norm. Channels for seeking redress stay blocked. Lack of transparency breeds impunity,\" Amnesty Internationals researcher said. The events during the April 2009 Moldova civil unrest have drawn criticism of human rights violations, including in regard to the deaths of Valeriu Boboc, Ion \u0162\u00e2buleac, and Eugen \u0162apu ==See also== *Trupele de Carabinieri *Moldovan Border Police *Crime in Moldova ==External links== * Internal Affairs Ministry * Moldova Police (IGP) == References == ",
