The museum also owns and manages a railroad depot located in La Mesa. ==Facilities== ===Campo=== Since 1986, the Campo Railroad Park & Museum operates all-volunteer train excursions from the restored 1916 Depot in Campo, in the Mountain Empire area of southeastern San Diego County, California. These trains are powered by vintage diesel-electric locomotives.Nancy Ray, \"The Ties That Bind : Little 'Railroad That Can' Maintains Glory of Ribbon of Steel's Golden Age\", Los Angeles Times, November 30, 1986.Nancy Ray, \"Rail Museum Gets Up Steam : Visitors Will Soon Be Offered Rides on Trains\", Los Angeles Times, May 20, 1985. The facility sits on a property. The museum also has approximately 100 historic railroad cars and locomotives on display, including five steam locomotives, seventeen diesel locomotives and many other pieces of rolling stock. A large display building houses part of the railroad equipment collection which allows visitors to view or walk through the equipment. A new donation has been received for an exhibit titled \"Signal Science\" which uses retired railroad signals to demonstrate how railway signals work. The museum is also home to the Southwest Railway Library, which opened in Campo in July 2014. The library contains the second largest collection of railroad history in California. ===La Mesa=== The museum manages the original La Mesa depot in downtown La Mesa, next to the La Mesa Boulevard stop on the Orange Line of the San Diego Trolley.
