It was written by Lopez, Kimberly Krysiuk, Varren Wade, Moses Ayo Samuels, Olaniyi Michael Akinkunmi, Mikkel Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Karim Kharbouch. \"Medicine\" was released as a single on April 3, 2019. It marks Lopez's first release under Hitco Entertainment, and her third collaboration with French Montana, following \"Same Girl\" and \"I Luh Ya Papi\", both of which appeared on Lopez's eighth studio album A.K.A (2014). ==Background== On working with French Montana again, Lopez said \"I love collaborating with people from the Bronx, it makes me feel at home, like a special connection\", adding: \"At the core I\u2019m still Jenny from the Block. And this new track brought that out.\" The singer described \"Medicine\" as a \"very sassy song, very kind of woman empowerment\", noting: \"[It\u2019s] kind of giving you taste of what you give out, letting guys know that we\u2019re not going to take any junk.\" ==Release== Lopez announced the song on social media on March 21, 2019, sharing the cover art and pre-order link. On April 3, 2019, Lopez debuted the song live on The Morning Mash-Up on SiriusXM Hits 1 Celebrity Session. The cover art was noted for Lopez's use of Designer Heidi Lee's Endless Echo Hat that was previously worn by a man known as Di Mondo on the red carpet of the Chilean 2013 Vi\u00f1a del Mar International Song Festival. ==Critical response== Idolator's Mike Wass compared the song favorably to Lopez's previous singles, \"Get Right\" (2005) and \"Do It Well\" (2007), due to its \"heavy percussion\", stating that it feels \"familiar to old-school fans.\" Jacqueline Reed of NPR also compared the song to \"Get Right\", writing: \"The jazz-hop melody and layered brass and drum action (...) of this new single makes for an empowering, timeless track that could easily find its place either on the tracklist of Rebirth or in today's day and age.\" Rania Aniftos of Billboard described the track as \"infectious\". ==Chart performance== The song reached number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, making it Lopez's 17th number-one single on this chart therefore putting her in a three-way tie between Mariah Carey and Kristine W in sixth place respectively for most number ones on the chart. ==Music video== The music video for \"Medicine\" features a white carnival theme, in which Lopez \"is depicted as the ring leader of a white monochromatic freak show\" that includes fortune tellers, a 50-foot cake and a moving carousel. The full video premiered on both YouTube and during an episode of her NBC television series World of Dance on April 7, 2019. It marked Lopez's first time working with director Jora Frantzis. Her wardrobe in the video includes a jumpsuit designed by Zuhair Murad. On May 17, 2019, Lopez released a second video for the song's remix, \"Medicine (Steve Aoki from The Block Remix)\" featuring Steve Aoki. == Performances == Lopez performed the song live for the first time during Today, at Rockefeller Plaza on May 6th in New York City as part of the shows Citi Concert Series. Lopez was the opening act and kicked off the event performing the song as part of a medley that also included 2011's \"On the Floor\" and \"Jenny from the Block\" (2002).
