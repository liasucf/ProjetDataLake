    "text": "Plant for Pakistan (Plant4Pakistan), also known as 10 Billion Tree Tsunami, is a five-year project to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan from 2018 to 2023. Prime Minister Imran Khan kicked off the drive on 2 September 2018 with approximately 1.5 million trees planted on the first day. The campaign was based on the successful Billion Tree Tsunami campaign of the former Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government, also led by Imran Khan, in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2014. In 2020, the program tripled its number of workers to 63,600 after being momentarily halted following the coronavirus pandemic, aiming to enlist those left unemployed by its economic consequences. Most of the work, which pays between 500-800 rupees (US$3-5) a day, takes place in rural areas, with people setting up nurseries, planting saplings, and serving as forest protection guards. The plan was awarded 7.5 billion rupees ($46m) in funding.. Saplings planted during the initiative included mulberry, acacia, moringa and other indigenous species. == See also == * Billion Tree Tsunami, a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan reforestation project * Trillion Tree Campaign, a UNEP call to plant 1 trillion (10,00,00,00,00,000) trees. == References == Category:Imran Khan administration Category:Environmental protection ",
