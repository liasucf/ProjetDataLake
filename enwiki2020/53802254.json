The street extends southwards from Ma\u0142y Rynek to Dominika\u0144ska Street (Ulica Dominika\u0144ska). The oldest recorded name of the street is platea fratrum Praedicatorum (relating to the existence of the Holy Trinity Basilica at the southern point of the street), from 1305. The present name was first recorded in 1542. The curve in the street is a result of a dwelling prior to Krak\u00f3w receiving its city rights in 1257 laying in its transcent. The street features the consulates of France, Germany and the United States of America. The street is part of the Lesser Polish Way of Saint James from Sandomierz to Tyniec. ==Features== {| |----- bgcolor=\"#FF 8C 00\" ! width=4% | Street No. ! width=26% | Short description ! width=10% | Picture |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 2 || align=\"center\"| Gutkowski House - built between 1851 and 1861.
