Mar\u00edtimo. He made his first-team and Primeira Liga debut to kickstart the 2000\u201301 season, against F.C. Alverca (0\u20130 away draw, 90 minutes played). Briguel also played five times for the Portugal under-21 side, though never an undisputed starter at Mar\u00edtimo (years after being promoted to the first team, he continued appearing in the odd match for the reserves). He retired at the end of the 2015\u201316 campaign at the age of 37, after having contributed with ten games to a 13th-place finish; on 17 December 2014, he reached the 700th-game mark with his only club. Subsequently, Briguel worked as Mar\u00edtimo's director of football. ==See also== *List of one-club men ==References== ==External links== * *National team data * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Funchal Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Madeiran footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:C.S.
