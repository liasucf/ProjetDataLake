    "text": "Disney's One Too (later known as Disney's Animation Weekdays) was a two-hour Sunday-to-Friday children's programming block that aired on UPN from September 6, 1999 to August 31, 2003. A spin-off of the Disney's One Saturday Morning block on ABC (owned by The Walt Disney Company), it featured animated series from Disney Television Animation aimed at children between the ages of 6-11 ==History== In January 1998, UPN began discussions with The Walt Disney Company (owner of rival network ABC) to have the company program a daily two- hour children's block for the network, airing on weekdays (during the morning or afternoon hours) and Sunday mornings. Attempts to reach a time-lease agreement deal with Disney were called off one week after negotiations started due to a dispute between Disney and UPN over how the block would be branded and the amount of E/I programming that Disney would provide for the block; UPN then entered into discussions with then-corporate sister Nickelodeon (both networks were owned by Viacom) to produce the new block. That February, UPN entered into an agreement with Saban Entertainment (then a subsidiary of Fox Family Worldwide, owned jointly by Fox, which Disney later acquired in 2019, and founder, Haim Saban, who also owned competing block Fox Kids) \u2013 which distributed two series recently aired on the UPN Kids block around that time, Sweet Valley High and Breaker High \u2013 to program the Sunday-to-Friday block. In March 1998, UPN resumed discussions with Disney and the following month, The Walt Disney Company and UPN came to an agreement to provide Disney-produced programs on the network on weekdays (from 7:00am \u2013 9:00am or 3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm) and Sunday (from 9:00am \u2013 11:00am). The block was originally announced under the working title \"Whomptastic\", though the name was changed prior to the debut of the block for greater brand identity (incidentally, \"whomp\" was used as a pejorative term in the Disney-produced animated series Recess, one of the series that would end up part of the new block, as a substitute for \"sucks\").Issue 3.2. The new lineup was later renamed Disney's One Too in July 1999, formatted to serve as a competitor block to ABC's existing children's block Disney's One Saturday Morning. The block debuted on September 6, 1999, replacing UPN Kids, which ended its run the day before (on September 5) after four years. Compared to the format of One Saturday Morning, One Too varied in that, instead of incorporating hosted segments, short gag segments from the shows featured in the block (such as Sabrina: The Animated Series, Doug and Recess, all of which \u2013 along with a few other series \u2013 were originally aired on One Saturday Morning) were usually shown, often preceding the start of each program, and after commercial breaks. The block also featured a different opening sequence, using more futuristic buildings and a theme similar to that used on One Saturday Morning. Many shows previously aired on One Too continued in reruns on Toon Disney and Disney Channel. In September 2002, the One Too branding was discontinued as a result of the rebranding of the ABC block from One Saturday Morning to ABC Kids; although the UPN block was not revived, the Disney.com website referred to it under the title Disney's Animation Weekdays. The block aired for the final time on August 31, 2003, with the time periods being turned over to UPN's affiliates; this left UPN as the only \"big six\" broadcast television network with no children's programming (and would never broadcast one again for the rest of the network's existence until its 2006 shutdown, and one of only two major commercial broadcast networks that never air a children's programming block (the other being Pax TV, which discontinued its Pax Kids lineup in 2000, before reviving children's programming as I: Independent Television through the 2006 launch of Qubo). UPN was not the first \"big six\" network to pull children's programming: NBC became the first to remove kids shows entirely in August 1992, when the network launched a live- action block for teenagers called TNBC; children's programming returned to NBC in 2002, through a time-lease agreement with Discovery Kids. In the years since the block was discontinued, all other major broadcast networks, including UPN successor The CW, would gradually abandon children's programming by selling their respective children's blocks to Litton Entertainment, who produces primarily unscripted E/I content targeted primarily at teenagers, or in the case of Fox, removing children's programming entirely. Fox's sister network, MyNetworkTV, has never supplied children's programming as part of its lineup; both networks leave the responsibility of acquiring E/I programming to the affiliates, primarily through the syndicated block Xploration Station in the case of the former. ==Programming== * Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000-03) * Digimon Frontier (2002-03) * Doug (1999-2001) * Hercules (1999-2000) * The Legend of Tarzan (2001-03) * Pepper Ann (2000-01) * Recess (1999-2003) * Sabrina: The Animated Series (1999-2002) * The Weekenders (2001-02) ==See also== * The Disney Afternoon \u2013 a syndicated children's program block that ran from 1990 to 1997. ==References== Category:Television programming blocks Category:Children's television networks in the United States ",
