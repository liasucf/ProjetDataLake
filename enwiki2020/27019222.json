Further education colleges offer courses for adult learners, including some academic qualifications, but mainly vocational studies and work-based learning. Sixth form colleges mainly offer academic qualifications such as A Levels for people between the ages of 16 and 19. Some further education colleges in Wales offer higher education courses such as degrees and diplomas, usually in conjunction with a nearby university. Welsh colleges are funded primarily by the Welsh Government, with subsidised tuition fees paid by individual students or their sponsors. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=cccccc !College!!Location!!Notes |- | Bridgend College || Bridgend, Cardiff, Maesteg, Pencoed,|| |- | Cardiff and Vale College || Cardiff, Barry || Formed in August 2011 as a result of a merger between Coleg Glan Hafren and Barry College |- | Cardiff Sixth Form College || Cardiff || An independent school established in 2004 |- | Coleg Cambria || Connah's Quay, Northop and Wrexham ||Formed in August 2013 as a merger of Deeside College and Yale College |- | Coleg Ceredigion || Aberystwyth, Cardigan || Constituent of University of Wales, Trinity Saint Davidhttp://www.carmarthenjournal.co.uk/Merger-secures-bright- future-higher-education/story-20428089-detail/story.html |- | Coleg Gwent || Newport, Crosskeys, Ebbw Vale, Pontypool, Usk || Largest FE college in Wales |- | Coleg Harlech || Harlech || Part of Adult Learning Wales - Addysg Oedolion Cymru |- | Grwp Llandrillo Menai || Main campuses in Bangor, Rhos-on- Sea, Dolgellau || Formed in April 2012 as a merger of Coleg Llandrillo and Coleg Menai. |- | Coleg Sir G\u00e2r || Carmarthen, Llanelli, Ammanford, Llandeilo || Constituent of University of Wales, Trinity Saint David |- | Coleg y Cymoedd || Aberdare, Llwynypia, Nantgarw, Rhymney, Ystrad Mynach || Formed in August 2013 as a merger of Coleg Morgannwg and Ystrad Mynach College |- | Gower College Swansea || Gorseinon, Swansea || Formed in August 2010 as a merger of Gorseinon College and Swansea College |- | Merthyr Tydfil College || Merthyr Tydfil || Constituent of the University of South Wales |- | NPTC Group || Brecon, Llandrindod Wells, Llansamlet, Neath, Newtown, Pontardawe, Port Talbot, || Formed in August 2013 as a merger of Neath Port Talbot College and Coleg Powyshttp://www.coleg-powys.ac.uk/2013/08/merger-success/ |- | Pembrokeshire College || Haverfordwest, Milford Haven || |- | St David's Catholic College || Cardiff || Sixth form college |- |} ==See also== * Education in Wales * List of further education colleges in England * List of further education colleges in Scotland * List of universities in Wales == References == Further education colleges in Wales Wal Coll ",
