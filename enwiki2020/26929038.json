Gateway Playhouse is a theatre located on the eastern edge of Bellport, New York. The street address is 215 South Country Road. It's the oldest of three professional theatres on the island and nationally recognized as one of the top ten summer theatres in the nation. Gateway Playhouse has been running for over sixty years. The theatre grounds encompass the Mainstage Theatre, Barn Theatre (for acting school classes and projects), scene shop, two rehearsal studios, three dorm-style housing units, a newly remodeled kitchen, costume shop, design office/studio, paint shop, box office, business office, various storage spaces, a recreation room and a large hedge-lined lawn with outdoor swimming pool (which holds the distinction of being the first ever in-ground swimming pool on Long Island). The Gateway Playhouse theatre seats 500 and its proscenium height is 34' holding 25 line sets for scenery and lights. == Acting School == The Gateway Playhouse enrolls students from all over Long Island; coming from as far away as Mattituck, Hampton Bays, Huntington and Syosset. They all have varying interests and levels of training, some with none and some with plenty. Many students have landed parts in the summer Children's Theater shows, as well as young roles in the Main Stage productions. Others have even had success in commercials and National Tours. Recently, several students have landed jobs in the industry, on network television series, Broadway shows, feature films, commercials and soaps. ==Past Seasons== === 1950-1959 === 1950 Taming of the Shrew The Importance of Being Earnest John Ferguson Physician in Spite of Himself/ A Marriage Proposal The Skin of Our Teeth -- Starring Sally Lawrence (Harris).
