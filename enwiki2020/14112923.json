    "text": "Cristian Vogel (born 1972) is an experimental electronic musician. ==Biography== Vogel first began working with electronic compositions in the late 1980s with the Cabbage Head Collective, where he worked with Si Begg, among others. He attended the University of Sussex under the tutorship of Martin Butler (composer) and Jonathan Harvey (composer), graduating with a degree in 20th century music. He began to suffuse techno compositions with influences from musique concr\u00e8te and other avant-garde styles. In the early 1990s, Vogel issued two EPs on Dave Clarke's Magnetic North Records label, the first of which was the underground success, Infra.[ Cristian Vogel] at Allmusic.com After further solo EPs and collaborations with emerging UK techno artists such as Neil Landstrumm and Dave Tarrida, Vogel released his debut full-length, Beginning to Understand, in 1994 on Mille Plateaux, and subsequently became the first UK techno artist to be signed to Berlin's Tresor Records. He also started the vinyl only label Mosquito with Si Begg, on which he released both his own music and other artists'. Vogel is considered to be one of the main founders of the No-Future collective that was active in Brighton during the mid-nineties. Alongside Jamie Lidell, he formed the group Super Collider, who released two albums before Jamie Lidell saw fame with his Warp Records album Multiply. Cristian Vogel also sings and plays guitar in his band project Night of the Brain, whilst continuing to maintain a presence on the underground techno scene. From 2003 to 2010, he worked with the Swiss choreographer Gilles Jobin, composing electronic music scores for 6 of his contemporary dance pieces. Over a 20-year career, Vogel has also worked as a remixer and album producer, having worked with artists such as Radiohead, Max\u00efmo Park, Chicks on Speed, and Thom Yorke. ==Discography== === Albums === * 1994 - Beginning to Understand (Mille Plateaux) * 1995 - Absolute Time (Tresor Records) * 1996 - Specific Momentific (Mille Plateaux) * 1996 - Body Mapping (Tresor Records) * 1997 - All Music has come to an End (Tresor Records) * 1999 - Busca Invisibles (Tresor Records) * 2000 - Rescate 137 (novamute) * 2000 - Sing Sweet Software (as Trurl and Klaupacious) (Supremat) * 2002 - Dungeon Master (Tresor Records) * 2005 - Station 55 (Novamute) * 2007 - Double Deux/Delicado (Station 55 Records) * 2007 - The Never Engine (Tresor Records) * 2010 - Black Swan (Choreographic score, 2009) (Sub Rosa) * 2012 - The Inertials (Shitkatapult) * 2014 - Polyphonic Beings (Shitkatapult) ===EPs=== * 1994 - Infra EP (Magnetic North) * 1994 - Lambda EP (Magnetic North) * 1994 - Intersync EP (Force Inc) * 1994 - Narco Synthesis EP (Ferox) * 1995 - Conscious Arrays EP (Force Inc) * 1997 - Two fat Downloads 88 EP (Primevil) * 1999 - Boom Busine EP (Mosquito) * 2009 - Crust Cloud Chunks EP (Snork Enterprises) * 2009 - Endless Process EP (Artifexbcn Records) * 2010 - Time To Feed The Alien EP (Snork Enterprises) ===Singles=== * 1994 - We equate Machines with Funkiness (Mosquito) * 1994 - Tales from the Heart (Force Inc) * 1995 - Defunkt #1 (Solid) * 1995 - Artists in Charge of Expert Systems (Mosquito) * 1996 - The Visit: Defunkt #2 (Solid) * 1996 - Demolish Serious Culture (Sativae) * 1998 - Defunkt Remixes (Solid) * 1998 - Syncopate to Generate (Sativae) * 1999 - General Arrepientase (Tresor) * 2000 - Whipaspank (Novamute) * 2001 - Me and My Shadow (Novamute) * 2005 - 1968.
