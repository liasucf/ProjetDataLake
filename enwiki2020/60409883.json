Pakerin was founded in 1977 at Mojokerto Regency by Soegiharto Njoo. == History == In 1970s, many sugar mills in Indonesia faced waste disposal problems. Only a small portion of their wastes (bagasse) can be used as fuels. As the result, sugar mills had to spend a significant amount of money for disposal purposes. Similarly, factories producing corrugated cardboard boxes and printed paper experienced difficulty in disposing their wastes, rejects, and paper trims. Soegiharto Njoo, the founder of Pakerin, saw the opportunity to use the waste as a raw material to manufacture pulp and paper. This idea is also supported by the fact that most industrial papers had to be imported from overseas. Responding to these market opportunities, PT. Pakerin was established in 1977 in Bangun Village, Mojokerto Regency is approximately distance about 38 km from southwestern of Surabaya. Pakerin started its business with one bagasse pulping plant, one waste water treatment plant, and one paper machine producing Duplex Board. On December 28, 1985 Pakerin expanded its factory with 6 paper mills with an installed capacity of 700,000 tons per year. == Products == List of papers and chemicals produced by Pakerin: * Medium Liner * Kraft Liner * Test Liner *Core Board * Grey Board * Coated Duplex *Caustic Soda * Liquid Chlorine * Hydro Cloric Acid * Sodium Hypochlorite == See also == * List of paper mills == References == == External links == * Official Website of Pabrik Kertas Indonesia Category:Pulp and paper companies of Indonesia Category:Companies established in 1977 Category:Indonesian brands Category:1977 establishments in Indonesia Category:Companies based in Surabaya ",
