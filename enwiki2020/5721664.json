He is best known for his portrayal of Cory in the series Trailer Park Boys. ==Life and career== Bowles was born in Montreal, Quebec and raised in Truro, Nova Scotia. Best known as Cory in Trailer Park Boys, he also is the principal choreographer of Halifax-based Contemporary Dance Company Verve Mwendo, plays in the rock band Aide-De-Camp and voices the children's series Poko.
