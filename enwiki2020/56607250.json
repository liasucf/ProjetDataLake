Nishad, the story revolves around a water dispute that crops up between the people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala on account of a well, with the film taking place in 1965 when Kerala was formed as a separate state. Jayaprada revealed that her political experience of seeing people through problems of water scarcity motivated her to sign the film and play the lead role. Portraying the widow of a geologist, who wants to fulfil her husband\u2019s desire to make water available to all, she stated the story \"fell in the category of \u2018meaningful cinema\u2019\" and that she was keen to be a part of such attempts. Revathy was signed to portray a collector of the Tamil Nadu village of Thirunelveli, which faces a water shortage every year. She was selected after the original choice, Suhasini opted out citing date issues. Nishad chose to shoot two versions, one in Malayalam and the other in Tamil, where each party would have the stronger cause. The Malayalam version of the film was shot first during May 2017, with most the scenes being shot at the Punalur Municipality and Chemmanthur High School premises. Scenes were also shot in Thiruvananthapuram during the same month, where a launch ceremony was held. The film was later shot in Tamil with Parthiban, Nassar, Anu Hasan and Rekha amongst others joining the cast. ==Soundtrack== The film features a song titled \"Ayya Sami\", sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and K. J. Yesudas, who worked together after a break of twenty seven years following Thalapathi (1991) for the song \"Kaatukkuyilu Manasukkula\". The song's lyrics narrates the celebration of Tamil Nadu and Kerala cultures, and was composed by M. Jayachandran and written by B. K. Harinarayanan and Palani Bharathi. The soundtracks were released simultaneously at an event on 7 February 2018, with the lead cast in both languages in attendance. ;Malayalam version ;Tamil version == References == ==External links== * Category:Malayalam-language films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2018 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian multilingual films Category:Films shot in Kollam Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Films about water scarcity Category:2010s multilingual films Category:Films directed by M.
