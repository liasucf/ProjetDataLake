    "text": "The Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2, known in French as the Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord (CSCN), is one of Alberta's four French language school boards. French language education is intended for children who are eligible under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The CSCN is a composite board, operating both public and catholic francophone schools in Beaumont, Camrose, Edmonton, Fort McMurray, Jasper, Legal, Lloydminster, Red Deer, Sherwood Park, St. Albert and Wainwright. The CSCN receives funding for all students from the provincial Government of Alberta. ==History== In 1993, the Government of Alberta adopted a bill amending the School Act to comply with Mahe v. Alberta (1990), a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the minority language education rights under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The district was created in 1994 under section 223.3 of the School Act under the name Regional Authority of the North Central Francophone Education Region No. 4 (since changed to Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 2). It is one of four French school boards in Alberta. ==Governance== According to the School Act (2001), the seven members of the Board of Trustees are elected to represent francophone communities in central and northern Alberta. The composite regional Authority's mandate is to protect the linguistic and confessional rights of section 23 holders. The CSCN updates its list of electors by carrying out a census, as required. Results of the census determine the proportion of Public school Trustees and Catholic school Trustees to be elected to the Board. The Catholic trustees constitute a separate entity \u2013 Conseil scolaire catholique Centre-Nord \u2013 according to section 255.4 of the School Act (2001). Based on the 2010 census, there are two Public school trustees and five Catholic school trustees. ==Size== In 2016-2017 school year, there were approximately 3,200 students attending 19 schools in total: 9 elementary schools, 1 elementary/junior high school, 1 junior high school, 2 junior/senior high school, 5 elementary/junior/senior high schools, and 1 senior high school. The CSCN employs approximately 350 teachers and professionals. ==Schools== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Public/Catholic !Address !City/Town !Grades |- ||\u00c9cole \u00c0 la D\u00e9couverte || Public || 10935 - 113 Street NW || Edmonton || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole Alexandre-Tach\u00e9 || Catholic || 30 Erin Ridge Drive || St. Albert || 7-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Bor\u00e9al || Catholic || 312 Abasand Drive || Fort McMurray || K-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Citadelle || Catholic || 5109 - 46 Street || Legal || K-9 |- ||\u00c9cole Claudette-et-Denis-Tardif || Public || 10 Hawkins Crescent || Sherwood Park || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole des Fondateur || Public || 4707 - 56 Street || Camrose || K-7 |- ||\u00c9cole Desrochers || Public || 302 Elm Avenue || Jasper || K-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Joseph-Moreau || Catholic || 9750 - 74 Avenue NW || Edmonton || 7-9 |- ||\u00c9cole La Mission || Catholic || 46 Heritage Drive || St. Albert || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole La Prairie || Catholic || 4810 - 34 Street || Red Deer || K-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Maurice-Lavall\u00e9e || Catholic || 8828 - 95 Street NW || Edmonton || 10-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Micha\u00eblle- Jean || Public || 10005 - 84 Street NW || Edmonton || 7-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Notre- Dame || Catholic || 15425 - 91 Avenue NW || Edmonton || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole P\u00e8re- Lacombe || Catholic || 10715 - 131A Avenue NW || Edmonton || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole publique Gabrielle-Roy || Public || 8728 - 93 Avenue NW || Edmonton || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole Saint-Christophe || Catholic || 214 - 8 Street || Wainwright || K-12 |- ||\u00c9cole Saint-Vital || Catholic || 5505 - Magasin Avenue || Beaumont || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole Sainte-Jeanne-d\u2019Arc || Catholic || 8505 - 68A Street NW || Edmonton || K-6 |- ||\u00c9cole Sans-Fronti\u00e8res || Public || 4204 - 54 Avenue || Lloydminster || K-12 |} ==See also== *List of Alberta school boards ==References== ==External links== *Conseil scolaire Centre-Nord\u2019s official website *Alberta Education *Study in Alberta Category:School districts in Alberta Category:Roman Catholic schools in Alberta Category:Education in Edmonton * Category:French-language school districts in Canada ",
