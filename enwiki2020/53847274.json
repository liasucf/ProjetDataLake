    "text": "Naughty Boys & Soldiers is a 1996 Taiwanese comedy film directed by Kevin Chu and written by Kuo Cheng, set in a 1970s coastal town with a primary school and a military base. While most of the comedy is slapstick zaniness, the film also pokes fun at the many absurdities in Taiwan's White Terror period, such as schools encouraging children to idolize Chiang Kai-shek and regurgitate his anti-Communist rhetoric. ==Cast== *Nicky Wu *Yvonne Yung *Jacky Wu *Steven Hao ==Theme song== *\"Hudie Fei Ya\" (\u8774\u8776\u98db\u5440; \"Fly, Butterfly\") performed by Xiao Hu Dui ==External links== * * Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Hokkien- language films Category:Films directed by Kevin Chu Category:Films with screenplays by Kuo Cheng Category:Films shot in Taiwan Category:Films set in Taiwan Category:Taiwanese comedy films Category:1996 comedy films Category:1996 films Category:Taiwanese films Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Cultural depictions of Chiang Kai-shek ",
