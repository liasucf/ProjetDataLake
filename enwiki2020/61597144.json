Soon after his appointment, he made a study tour of naval establishments of southern Europe, and later of Sweden and Russia. He was considered the most gifted of Henrik Gerner's pupils when Gerner was fabrikmester at Copenhagen and inherited all of Gerner's papers on the latter's death. In 1795 he became a lecturer in shipbuilding at the Naval Cadet Academy and at the same time a fully fledged member of the Construction Commission. Promoted to the most senior lieutenant's rankKapitejnlieutenant \u2013 immediately below full captain in rank in 1796, he became interim fabrikmester (master shipbuilder to the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy) as his predecessor E W Stibolt retired on health grounds,Political and personal rivalries made the position of fabrikmester a very stressful post! a position confirmed in 1797. In 1801 he was appointed to the Defence Commission. A report which disapproved of his handling of the building of the frigate Rota upset him greatly and at the age of 38, in 1803, Hohlenberg resigned his post and travelled to the Danish West Indies to become harbourmaster and chief pilot at Christiansted on St Croix. He died shortly after arrival on 9 January 1804. He was buried on the island, but the position of his grave was not recorded. The position of fabrikmester at the Danish Naval Dockyards remained unfilled until, in 1810, Jens J\u00f8gen Pihl was appointed. ==Hohlenberg's ships== Of the four ships-of-the-line built to Hohlemberg's designs, three were seized by the British at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and used by British shipyards. Their design and build qualities were greatly admired by the British naval officers who later served in them. Eleven frigates are also attributed to Hohlenberg along with a number of lesser ships which suffered from being too narrow in the beam. It may have been this latter characteristic that was responsible for the loss of HDMS Hvide \u00d8rn (1798) which capsized with the loss of all hands (including Frantz Hohlenberg's younger brother, JohanTops\u00f8e- Jensen Vol 1 page 587)in the Mediterranean the year after it was commissioned.Record card for HDMS Hvide \u00d8rn ;4 ships-of-the-line; *Christian den Syvende (84), Norge (78), and Prindsesse Caroline (66) were among those captured at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and added to the British Royal Navy *Prinds Christian Frederik was destroyed in March 1808 at the Battle of Zealand Point ;13 frigates; Of the thirteen Hohlenberg frigates built prior to 1807, nine were captured by the British Royal Navy at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807).
