Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (CGC) at Seoul National University has developed the Government Competitiveness (GC) index which evaluates government achievements in the various fields and furthermore provides policy recommendations to increase competitiveness of government in the future. == Description == Government competitiveness (GC) is often confounded with similar concepts. One of the prominent examples is national competitiveness. A variety of institutions have developed indices measuring the level of national competitiveness. Two indices, the World Competitiveness Scoreboard (WCS) developed by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) built by the World Economic Forum (WEF) have come to dominate the field of competitiveness studies. The International Institute for Management Development WCS and the World Economic Forum the Global Competitiveness Index view national competitiveness akin to how business-friendly a nation is, and focus upon economic and market indicators. As such, if a nation is a good place for foreign firms to do business and make money, it will, as a result, be viewed as competitive. Following this logic, the role played by a government then, is mainly restricted to constructing an environment that is attractive to businesses.For the general assessment on the two indices, see Ochel, W & Rohn, O. (2006). Ranking of countries \u2013 the WEF, IMD, Fraser and Heritage Indices. CESifo DICE Report Vol. 4 no. 2. pp. 48-60. Stressing the broader fields of government activities, several institutions have started to develop indicators emphasizing the role of government in driving development and national competitiveness. Prominent examples include The World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) and the Quality of Government Institute\u2019s (QGI) (the University of Gothenburg) Quality of Government indicators(QoG). While these two indices constitute important steps toward improving our understanding of how government contributes toward competitiveness, they have also revealed numerous theoretical and methodological shortcomings related to the study of governments\u2019 role in fostering national competitiveness.(2007) For the critics on the WGI and its responses, see Kaufmann, D, Kraay, A, & Mastruzzi, M. Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (director: Tobin Im) has developed the GC index mainly focusing on government capacities and roles in national development. After investigating the limited capabilities of existing competitiveness indicators to define and measure the level of GC, the CGC has tried to develop a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring GC.Im, T. (2014). Government Competitiveness 2013. Seoul: CM Press (in Korean); Im, T., Kim, S., Ko, G., & Jo, W. (2014). Government Competitiveness: Theory and Evaluation Index. Seoul: Bakyoungsa (In Korean). According to Ho and Im (2012), the concept of GC can be defined as \u201cthe power of government to, in light of various constraints, take resources from in and outside of the country and improve social, economic and cultural conditions of the nation in order to sustainably enhance citizens\u2019 quality of life.\u201d Moreover, the concepts of \u2018constraints\u2019 and \u2018quality of life\u2019Ho, A., & Im, T. (2012). Defining a new concept of government competitiveness. The Korean Journal of Public Administration, 50 (3), p. 13 (In Korean). can be interpreted in various ways, depending on a nation's unique environments. By considering different experiences and policy practices between developed countries and developing countries, the CGC measures the level of government competitiveness by applying different criteria to OECD and non-OECD countries. The seven fields of government activities both OECD and non-OECD countries have in common are followings: economy, education, health and welfare, agriculture and food, ICT, energy and environment, and governance. For OECD countries, three more fields are added: research and development, culture and tourism, and disaster management. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries have nine fields of government activities in total including infrastructure and safety. The CGC builds the GC index based on David Easton's system theory as a theoretical framework.Easton, D. (1953). The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science. New York: Wiley. Therefore, the GC Index first analyzes competitiveness through each of the four levels- input, throughput (public management capacity), output, and outcome. The index then aggregates results from each level to produce an overall competitiveness score. This approach generates a variety of policy implications at each systemic level. The following are some sub-categories for each stage Input: resources, infrastructure, government expenditure, environment Throughput: human, fiscal, organizational capacity, policy, system, process Output: production, growth rate, improvement level, immediate goal achievement Outcome: quality of life, satisfaction, social capital, ultimate goal achievement Figure 1.
