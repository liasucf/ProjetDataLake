    "text": "Glenn E. Palmer (born 1961) is the sheriff of Grant County, Oregon. He was first appointed in November 2000 and has since been elected in five consecutive elections. Palmer gained national attention with respect to his response during the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. He met with armed militants who were holding the federal facility and called them \"patriots\". ==Career== Palmer began his law enforcement career in 1985, working as a corrections officer. He later served as a Deputy Sheriff, and a patrolman in John Day. He was appointed Sheriff in 2000 and elected the same year; and has since been reelected in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. ===Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge=== In early February 2016, militants LaVoy Finicum, Ammon Bundy, and others left the site of the occupation in Harney County in two trucks to drive to neighboring Grant County, where they expected to meet Palmer and speak at a public meeting. Just before crossing into Grant County, their motorcade was stopped by police. The occupants of one truck surrendered at the initial traffic stop. Meanwhile, in the other truck, Finicum repeatedly yelled to police that they were going to meet Palmer. Finicum then fled, speeding towards Grant County. A short way before the county line Finicum encountered a roadblock, where he was shot and killed. While this played out, Palmer was in uniform at the public meeting in Grant County, waiting to greet the militants. He did not know about the roadblock just south of the Grant county line because the FBI, and Oregon State Police considered Palmer to be a security leak. To keep Palmer in the dark about the operation, they intentionally set the roadblock in next door Harney County. Later that month, complaints were filed against Palmer by the chief of police for the city of John Day and also by the Grant County dispatcher. As of August 2016, Palmer was being investigated by the Oregon Department of Justice for allegedly tampering with public records. There were eleven pending complaints against him. Palmer was reelected in 2016, with 51% of the vote, defeating former undersheriff Todd McKinley.Sheriff who met refuge occupiers re-elected, KOIN, Shuly Wasserstrom, Nov 10, 2016. Retrieved May 9, 2018. ==Personal life== Palmer and his wife, RoseAnn, have three children and two grandchildren. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Oregon sheriffs Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Grant County, Oregon ",
