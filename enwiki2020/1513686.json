    "text": "Abra-Catastrophe! is the seventh, eighth and ninth episodes of the third season of The Fairly OddParents, serving as the series' first television film. ==Plot== All the fairies in Fairy World celebrate Timmy Turner's Fairy- versary, a magical event that only occurs when a godchild is able to keep his/her fairies a secret for an entire year. After receiving numerous magical gifts, Jorgen Von Strangle gives Timmy a magical muffin that allows anyone who eats it to have a \"rule-free\" wish. Timmy then asks how he got Cosmo and Wanda as his godparents. Wanda shows through a flashback that his parents lied to an 8-year old Timmy and tricked him into hiring Vicky as his babysitter. Upset, Timmy inadvertently wishes that his parents could tell the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Turner begin to feel guilty and they start counting the many times they have lied to Timmy. Timmy takes the muffin to school, but is followed by Mr. Crocker who detects the magic within the muffin. Crocker attempts to retrieve the muffin, but only manages to get it out of Timmy's possession. During muffin day at lunch, Timmy sees Crocker frantically searching for the muffin, which leads Timmy to initiate a food fight. The muffin ends up in the paws of Bippy, a monkey that Timmy sets free, and he takes a bite of the muffin. Suddenly, the whole world is transformed, leaving monkeys the rulers of Earth. To make matters worse, Timmy was being chased by leopards after he loses his Godparents when Jorgen announces to all fairies that Da Rules say they have to be Godparents of the \"dominant species\" on Earth: monkeys. Bippy ends up getting Cosmo and Wanda as godparents. Timmy, who still remembers Cosmo and Wanda, follows Bippy to try to get him to unwish everything. Timmy returns to Mr. Crocker's class, who is now ranting about Apes using fairies to take over the world. Mr. Crocker is taken by the apes to a place off-limits to Humans. With Crocker gone, Timmy enters the Crocker Cave and steals a magic detector. He uses the magic detector to track down Bippy, whom he finds with the Fairy- versary muffin along with Cosmo and Wanda. Timmy almost succeeds in retrieving the muffin, but is captured by the Apes and brought to the human testing center along with Francis and Mr. Crocker, who suggests the apes to take Timmy instead since he's planning on hosting a party. Timmy is taken to a surgical room where his skull is about to be drilled into when Bippy showed up to rescue him. Bippy manages to fight off the apes at first, but is eventually overwhelmed. Luckily, due to Cosmo's 'paraphrasing' of Bippy's wish (which Cosmo claims could just as easily have been for another banana), everything is unwished moments before Timmy was about to be harmed. Timmy discovers that Bippy lost the muffin during the scuffle, and immediately after the world is returned to normal, Crocker finds the muffin, takes a bite, and wishes he could catch a fairy. He obtains a butterfly net (one of the few items a fairy's magic has no effect on) and captures Wanda. Cosmo is devastated and Bippy flees. Timmy realizes that the first thing Crocker will do with his newfound power is rub it in the face of his students, so he rushes back to his school. With his new-found power, Crocker appears in a power armor suit, which has Wanda trapped in a scepter and the Fairy-versary muffin within the chest cavity. He terrorizes his students by turning them into ice statues (he wanted to turn them into ash), turning Sanjay and Chester's heads into toilets when they asked to go the bathroom, and then chases Timmy off as he transforms the world and makes himself the all-powerful magical leader. Timmy arms himself with the various gifts he got from his Fairy-versary party, and goes to confront Crocker. Crocker abuses Wanda's magic by having the citizens bow down to him and make them eat shrimp puffs. Timmy, disguised as a masked hero, engages Crocker in a magical duel. Crocker has the upper hand, until Cosmo returns with \"5-second massive pecs\" and pummels him. However, Cosmo lets his guard down, and he too is captured. Timmy and Crocker fight through time and space before Timmy's cover is blown. Crocker decides to threaten Timmy's parents realizing he cannot destroy him with magic. Returning home, Timmy (now locked in chains due to Crocker) sees his parents under the mercy of Crocker and surrenders. Timmy and his parents reconcile. Left with no other choice, Timmy reveals that Cosmo and Wanda are his fairy godparents, breaking the sacred cardinal law of Da Rules. This results in Cosmo and Wanda breaking free of Crocker's control, and are sent back to Fairy World. With Crocker now powerless, Mr. and Mrs. Turner start pummeling him, knocking the muffin out of his possession. Timmy grabs and eats the rest of the muffin, and wishes for his godparents to return. After poofing away the chains binding Timmy, Timmy then wishes for everything to be back to normal. Back at school, Crocker attempts to convince everyone that fairies exist and that they will all bow down to him, but no one believes him. Crocker is then injected with medicine and sent to a mental institution. Jorgen shows up in Timmy's room and says that, even though everything is fixed, he still broke Da Rules. Before he can take Cosmo and Wanda away, Timmy throws the Forget-Me-Knob (a magical item that was used in the beginning to keep Timmy's parents away from the party) at Jorgen's head, who forgets what he was doing. Cosmo and Wanda then trick him into \"assigning\" Timmy as their godchild to which Jorgen agrees. Timmy reminds them that he \"just got fairy godparents\", so Cosmo and Wanda reenact their first meeting with Timmy. ==Cast== *Tara Strong as Timmy Turner / Kid *Daran Norris as Cosmo / Mr. Turner / Jorgen Von Strangle *Susanne Blakeslee as Wanda / Mrs. Turner *Carlos Alazraqui as Denzel Crocker / Ape *Grey DeLisle as Vicky / Principal Waxelplax / Tootie/ Flashback Fariy *Dee Bradley Baker as Bippy / Sanjay / Elmer / Kid / Fairy Private *Tom Kenny as Cupid / Muffin Man / Kid / Fairy Sergeant/ Flashback Fariy *Jason Marsden as Chester McBadbat *Gary LeRoi Gray as A.J. *Robert Costanzo as Easter Bunny / Construction Worker Ape / Ape Truck Driver *Faith Abrahams as Francis / Ape *Butch Hartman as Flashback Boy / Web-Eared Guy / Third Kid / Orderly *Cara Newman Ruyle as Flashback Girl / Female Ape #1 / Gorilla Business Woman *Jim Ward as Chet Ubetcha *Gary Le Mel as Fairy Cowlick Jr. (voice) ==Release== \"Abra-Catastrophe!\" premiered on July 12, 2003.
