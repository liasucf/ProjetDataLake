    "text": "I'll Remember April is a 1999 American family drama film starring Pat Morita, Pam Dawber, Haley Joel Osment, Mark Harmon and Yuki Tokuhiro. It was directed by Bob Clark. ==Plot== Four children capture a Japanese soldier who washes ashore during the Second World War. Although the horrors of World War II are far removed from the Pacific Coast community where adolescent Duke Cooper (Trevor Morgan) and his three best chums play soldier, experiment with swearing, and earnestly patrol the beach for Japanese submarines, the realities of the war are about to come crashing down around them. Not when a Japanese soldier, stranded and wounded when his sub quickly dived, washes ashore; his capture by the foursome merely allows for more playtime and thoughts of becoming heroes. It's coming because Duke's older brother is on some island awaiting combat and the black sedans with military tags have already begun rolling through town to deliver their grim announcements. And Duke's Japanese American pal Willie Tanaka (Yuki Tokuhiro), all three feet and 55 pounds of him, has suddenly become a threat to national security, so he, his mother, and grandfather are soon to be shipped away to an internment camp. ==External links== * * Category:1999 films Category:1999 drama films Category:1999 independent films Category:1990s war films Category:American adventure drama films Category:American children's drama films Category:American children's films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:Anti-war films about World War II Category:English- language films Category:Films about children Category:Films about families Category:Films about friendship Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about racism Category:Films directed by Bob Clark Category:Films scored by Paul Zaza Category:Films set in 1942 Category:Films set in California Category:Films set on the home front during World War II Category:World War II films ",
