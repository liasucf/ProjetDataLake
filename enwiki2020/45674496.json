    "text": "Aunt Hilda! or Tante Hilda is an animated French film directed by Beno\u00eet Chieux and Jacques-R\u00e9my Girerd. ==Plot== The film is set in Beaumont-les- Vignes, a fictional town in south-eastern France in the near future. Two sisters, Hilda and Dolores, followed diametrically opposite course. Hilda, a young redhead with a lanky silhouette, is a fierce environmentalist: she goes around on a bicycle, is always concerned about the preservation of the environment and gathered a plant museum where she keeps all kinds of plants. Dolores, on the other side, became the ruthless CEO of a multinational food company seeking profits in the short term. Thanks to the GMO technology that involves genetically modifying plants, Dolores has developed a new cereal called Attilem, a kind of giant artichoke with tentacles. This new product, able to grow with very little water and no fertilizer, should bring her astronomical profits. She says it could even solve the problem of hunger in the world and replace oil as a new source of energy. But soon the Attilem plants begin to grow too fast, out of control, and invade the world. Dolores design then a pesticide and proposes to sell to governments to fight against the disaster that her company has provoked. Aunt Hilda does not agree and began to work to save the world her way, but the game is not over. ==Cast== * Sabine Az\u00e9ma as Aunt Hilda * Josiane Balasko as Dolor\u00e8s * Fran\u00e7ois Morel as Ike * Bruno Lochet as Turner * Serguei Vladimirov as Michael Aldashin * Gilles D\u00e9troit as The President * Bernard Bouillon as Julio Attilio * Christian Taponard as Johnson * Line Wibl\u00e9 as Marie * Jean-Pierre Yvars as Pierre ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- !
