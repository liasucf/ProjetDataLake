The season kicked off on Friday, April 13 when the 2006 league runners-up Rochester Raging Rhinos traveled to the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in Bayamon to take on the Puerto Rico Islanders. ==General== * Two new teams join the First Division: the California Victory (San Francisco, CA), and the Carolina RailHawks (Cary, NC). * The Virginia Beach Mariners franchise was terminated by the league. * The Toronto Lynx depart the First Division for the Premier Development League (PDL). * Three new teams join the Second Division: the Bermuda Hogges (Hamilton, Bermuda), the Cleveland City Stars, and Crystal Palace Baltimore. * The Long Island Rough Riders depart the Second Division for the PDL. * The Pittsburgh Riverhounds will be on hiatus during 2007 to reorganize. * Many new teams join the PDL, for a complete list see here. ==Honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Competition !Champion !Runner-Up !Regular Season Champion/Best USL team |- |USL First Division |Seattle Sounders |Atlanta Silverbacks |Seattle Sounders |- |USL Second Division |Harrisburg City Islanders |Richmond Kickers |Richmond Kickers |- |USL PDL |Laredo Heat |Michigan Bucks |Hampton Roads Piranhas |- |U.S. Open Cup |New England Revolution (MLS) |FC Dallas (MLS) |Carolina Railhawks/Seattle Sounders |- |} ==Standings== ===First Division=== The schedule was not a balanced home and away affair; to make up the four extra games to total 28, each team played their four geographically closest competitors. The playoff format was changed to qualify eight instead of six teams; therefore the first and second league champions obtained seeding to determine home field advantage instead of a first round bye as in previous seasons. The previous bidding to host between the two playoff finalists for the one game cup final was discontinued for this season. ====Playoffs==== ===Second Division=== ====Playoffs==== ===Premier Development League=== *See 2007 PDL Season ==See also== * United Soccer Leagues ==References== ==External links== * Official USL Site 2 United Soccer Leagues 2007 ",
