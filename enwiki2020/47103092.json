The club, which is the G League affiliate of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Toronto Raptors, plays their home games at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre, replacing the Centre's former basketball tenant, the Mississauga Power of the National Basketball League of Canada. The team often plays home games at the Scotiabank Arena, the home of their parent club, the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors 905 is the eighth G-League team to be owned by an NBA team and the first G-League team to be located outside of the United States. The name \"905\" refers to the local area code of the suburban Greater Toronto Area, and is a common shorthand referring to the suburbs surrounding Toronto. ==History == In 2008, Raptors President and General Manager Bryan Colangelo said that Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE) was considering launching an NBA Development League franchise in the Toronto area within a couple of years to serve as a developmental team for the Raptors. Hamilton's Copps Coliseum and Oshawa were reportedly under consideration to host the franchise. However, a Canadian-based franchise posed difficulties due to tax and visa issues, and Rochester, New York, which is just across the United States border, was considered as an alternative. Hershey Centre in Mississauga. In April 2015, Colangelo's replacement Masai Ujiri announced that MLSE's board had approved purchasing a franchise, and that they were in negotiations with the NBA over where the team would play and whether it could be launched in time for the 2015-16 season. In June 2015 it was announced that MLSE had purchased a D-League franchise, which would be named the Raptors 905 and would begin play that fall at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. The team is named after the area code used by much of suburban Greater Toronto Area. The franchise reportedly cost $6 million. An agreement was negotiated with the Mississauga Power of the National Basketball League of Canada, which held the basketball lease at the Hershey Centre, with the Power folding. The team planned to play some games at Toronto's Air Canada Centre, home of their NBA affiliate the Toronto Raptors. On July 7, 2015, Jesse Mermuys was hired as head coach and Dan Tolzman as general manager. Mermuys left his position as an assistant coach under Toronto Raptors head coach, Dwane Casey. On July 28, 2015, veteran coach Tim Lewis was named lead assistant coach. On November 4, 2015, Raptors 905 unveiled their new uniforms and an alternate logo. On June 13, 2016, it was reported that Mermuys would leave the 905 for the LA Lakers, joining them as an assistant coach. In September, the Raptors announced that Jerry Stackhouse would be the head coach of the Raptors 905 team. In 2016\u201317, the 905 finished with a 39\u201311 record (the second best record in D-League history) clinching their first division title and with a record of 21\u20134 on the road (a D-League record). Stackhouse was awarded the Coach of the Year, while Center Edy Tavares was awarded Defensive Player of the Year. Making their way to the playoffs as the top seed, they swept the Canton Charge in the first round and then swept the Maine Red Claws in the second, clinching their first conference title. In the finals, they met the Western Conference champion Rio Grande Valley Vipers who they beat in three games and claimed their first title in franchise history. Pascal Siakam was named the Finals MVP after recording 32 and 17 points in Game's 2 and 3 respectively. ==Alumni == Current NBA players Bruno Caboclo, Pascal Siakam, Jakob Poeltl, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, Delon Wright, Chris Boucher, Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas, Oshae Brissett, and former players Lucas Nogueira, Anthony Bennett and Jared Sullinger have all played for Raptors 905. ==Season-by-season== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Season !rowspan=2|Division !colspan=4|Regular season !rowspan=2|Postseason results |- !Finish !!Wins !!Losses !!Pct. |- |colspan=10 align=\"center\" style=\";\"|Raptors 905 |- |2015\u201316 || Atlantic || 5th || 23 || 27 || .460 || |- |2016\u201317 || Central || 1st || 39 || 11 || .780 ||align=left|Won First Round (Canton) 2\u20130 Won Semifinals (Maine) 2\u20130 Won Finals (Rio Grande) 2\u20131 |- |2017\u201318 || Atlantic || 2nd || 31 || 19 || ||align=left| Won First Round (Grand Rapids) 92\u201388 Won Conf.
