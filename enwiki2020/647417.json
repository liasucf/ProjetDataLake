Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing, p. 6 Der Tod des Dichters Pietro Aretino (The Death of the Poet Pietro Aretino) by Anselm Feuerbach. Death from laughter is a rare form of death, usually resulting from either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation, that has itself been caused by a fit of laughter. Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from the times of ancient Greece to modern times. == Pathophysiology == Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from benign laughter. Infarction of the pons and medulla oblongata in the brain may cause pathological laughter. Laughter can cause atonia and collapse (\"agelastic syncope\"), which in turn can cause trauma. See also laughter-induced syncope, cataplexy, and Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Gelastic seizures can be due to focal lesions to the hypothalamus. Depending upon the size of the lesion, the emotional lability may be a sign of an acute condition, and not itself the cause of the fatality. Gelastic syncope has also been associated with the cerebellum. == Notable cases== *Zeuxis, a 5th-century BC Greek painter, is said to have died laughing at the humorous way in which he painted the goddess Aphrodite \u2013 after the old woman who commissioned it insisted on modeling for the portrait. * One ancient account of the death of Chrysippus, the 3rd-century BC Greek Stoic philosopher, tells that he died of laughter after he saw a donkey eating his figs; he told a slave to give the donkey neat wine with which to wash them down, and then, \"having laughed too much, he died\" (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius 7.185). * In 1410, King Martin of Aragon died from a combination of indigestion and uncontrollable laughter triggered by a joke told by his favourite court jester. * In 1556, Pietro Aretino \"is said to have died of suffocation from laughing too much\".Waterfield, Gordon, ed. First Footsteps in East Africa, (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1966) p. 59 footnote. * In 1660, Thomas Urquhart, the Scottish aristocrat, polymath, and first translator of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's writings into English, is said to have died laughing upon hearing that Charles II had taken the throne. * In 1799, William Cushing, a pauper who lived in the parish of St Andrew's, Norwich, England, died from \"a fit of excessive laughter, which lasted five minutes.\" * On October 14, 1920, 56-year-old Arthur Cobcroft, a dog trainer from Loftus Street, Leichhardt, Australia, was reading a five-year-old newspaper and was amused at the prices for some commodities in 1915 as compared to 1920. He made a remark to his wife regarding this, and burst into laughter, and in the midst of it he collapsed and died. A doctor named Nixon was called in, and stated that the death was due to heart failure, brought by excessive laughter.Laughter causes death, The Argus (October 18, 1920)Died of Laughter, The Register (October 18, 1920)Death Follows Laughter., Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative (October 21, 1920)Died Laughing., The Sydney Stock and Station Journal (October 22, 1920) * On March 24, 1975, Alex Mitchell, from King's Lynn, England, died laughing while watching the \"Kung Fu Kapers\" episode of The Goodies, featuring a kilt-clad Scotsman with his bagpipes battling a master of the Lancastrian martial art \"Eckythump\", who was armed with a black pudding. After 25 minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell finally slumped on the sofa and died from heart failure. His widow later sent The Goodies a letter thanking them for making Mitchell's final moments of life so pleasant. Diagnosis of his granddaughter in 2012 of having the inheritable long QT syndrome (a heart rhythm abnormality) suggests that Mitchell may have died of a cardiac arrest caused by the same condition. == See also == * Kuru, also known as \"laughing sickness\" * Laughing gas * Paradoxical laughter * Sardonicism * Tickle torture == References == == External links == * Snopes.com article Laughter Category:Laughter ",
