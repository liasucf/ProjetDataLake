    "text": "Attack! Attack! were a Welsh rock band from Caerphilly and Aberdare, formed in 2006. They released their eponymous debut album in 2008, with a second album The Latest Fashion released on 27 September 2010 through Hassle Records. Their third album, Long Road to Nowhere, was announced for a 1 April 2013 release, and this was later confirmed to be their final release. The band played a farewell April/May headliner in 2013 and then split. ==Biography== They have toured across the UK with other British bands such as The Blackout, Funeral for a Friend, Lostprophets, Kids in Glass Houses and also American bands like New Found Glory and Zebrahead. Neil Starr came from Dopamine to form Attack! Attack! with Ryan Day. Will Davies came from the band Adequate Seven. Ryan Day and Mike Griffiths also played together in Pete's Sake. The band finished a co-headlining UK tour with Tonight Is Goodbye during February 2009, with the two bands exchanging the headlining and main support positions every night. They played at the Hevy Music Festival on 1 August 2009 and at Butserfest on 12 September 2009. Their song \"You and Me\" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero 5. The band played their first headline tour with support acts Not Advised, Gap Year Riot and Impulse 11. In 2012, Ryan Day left Attack! Attack! to form a side project with former members of The Next Nine Years, also from South Wales. On 22 March 2013, the band announced their decision to split after months of deliberating, stating that they will continue to finish their tour, but, for personal reasons, this will be without Ryan Day and Mike Griffiths. Neil and Will have gone on to form the band States and Empires with drummer Johno Fisher from the band Evita. The new band toured with Zebrahead in October 2013 across Europe before going into the studio to record their debut album. In 2017 Neil Starr joined Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons as lead vocalist, it is not clear if this means the end of Zebrahead. ==Members== *Neil Starr \u2014 lead vocals, rhythm guitar (2006\u20132013) *Will Davies \u2014 bass guitar (2006\u20132013) *Mike Griffiths \u2014 drums, percussion (2006\u20132013) *Ryan Day \u2014 lead guitar, backing vocals (2006-2012) ==Tours== * 2010 Tours: Attack!
