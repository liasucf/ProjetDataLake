In January 2018, the Valencia\u2013Castell\u00f3n section was rebuilt with a third rail to dual gauge at a cost of \u20ac355 million, allowing standard gauge AVE high-speed rail services to run from Castell\u00f3n to Madrid via Valencia. A new built 46\u00b75 km cut-off section between Camp de Tarragona and Vandell\u00f2s bypassing the last remaining section of single track on the Mediterranean corridor west of Tarragona, started commercial services on January 13, 2020. The new section leads to a triangular junction with the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line just west of Camp de Tarragona station. ==Services== Along with aforementioned AVE services, Cercan\u00edas Valencia commuter rail services operate to Castell\u00f3n, and regional Barcelona\u2013Valencia\u2013Alicante services and Rodalies de Catalunya regional services in Catalonia. A high speed Avant service from Tortosa to Barcelona- Sants, calling at L'Aldea, L'Hospitalet de l'Infant, Cambrils and Camp de Tarragona was introduced in February 2020. In addition the Euromed service connects the city of Barcelona to the city of Valencia in 2 hours and 35 minutes, running at speeds up to 220 km/h. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Catalonia Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Iberian gauge railways Category:Railway lines opened in 1868 ",
