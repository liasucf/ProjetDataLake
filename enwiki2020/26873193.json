There he was responsible to collect foreign language books for the children\u2019s collection, and he soon discovered, \u201cThe library had books in more than 75 languages, but I could find none in Amharic\u201d. This spurred him on to find books written in Ethiopia\u2019s predominant language. When he found none, he took it upon himself to write the book Silly Mammo, a traditional Ethiopian folktale, in an Amharic and English translation. He also connected with Jane Kurtz, a children\u2019s author, who had lived much of her childhood in Ethiopia, and she helped him publish Silly Mammo.

In 2002, Gebregeorgis quit his job at the San Francisco Public Library and moved back to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with 15,000 books and ready to open his first free library for children.
