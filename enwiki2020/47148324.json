    "text": "M.F. Horn 3 (stylized M.F. Horn|3) is an album by Canadian jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. After Ferguson moved from England to the U.S. in 1973, his band changed, as British members were replaced by American musicians, primarily from colleges. The album was produced by Mike Smith and Teo Macero. == Critical reception == The third installment in the \"M.F. Horn\" series features some of Maynard's first experiments with funk in a big band setting, which excited some, and confused others. As one reviewer said, \"the music on this album is an exciting reminder of just how diverse the music scene really was during the early to mid-'70s, even if pigeonholers didn't yet have a controllable category for some of the sounds that were in the air at that time.\" ==Reissues== In 2007, M.F. Horn 3 was reissued by Wounded Bird Records. == Track listing == == Personnel == * Maynard Ferguson \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn, superbone * Mike Davis \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn * Alan Downey \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn * Tony Mabbett \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn * Terry Noonan \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn * Adrian Drover \u2013 trombone * Billy Graham \u2013 trombone * Geoff Wright \u2013 trombone * Andy MacIntosh \u2013 alto saxophone * Tony Buchanan \u2013 tenor saxophone * Bruce Johnstone \u2013 baritone saxophone * Pete Jackson \u2013 piano * Dave Markee \u2013 bass guitar * Randy Jones \u2013 drums * Ray Cooper \u2013 percussion * Vimu Macunda \u2013 veena ==References== Category:1973 albums Category:Albums produced by Teo Macero Category:Big band albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Maynard Ferguson albums ",
