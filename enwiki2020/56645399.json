The group publishes a haggadah via its website that substitutes cannabis for lettuce in the seder plate and promotes consumption of cannabis as part of the sacred rituals of Pesach (Passover). The haggadah includes the \"Ten Plagues of the Drug War\" and was meant to inspire discussion about the meaning of bondage in the modern age of mass incarceration and the war on drugs. ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Category:2015 establishments in Oregon Category:2015 in cannabis Category:Cannabis and Judaism Category:Cannabis in Oregon Category:Jews and Judaism in Oregon Category:Jewish organizations established in 2015 Category:Religious organizations using entheogens ",
