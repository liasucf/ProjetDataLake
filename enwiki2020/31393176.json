The first one to do so was Kanal D, in Turkey, which bought the right for the series and for future series in Bulgaria, but cencelled it later, because \"the series isn't suitable for the turkish audience\". Later, however, FOX Turkey bought the series and started airing it dubbed on July 25, 2010 at 2AM with the name \"S\u0131r\u00e7a Saray\". They cancelled it too after the first season. In the beginning of 2011, bTV announced that a deal has been made with four more countries to air the series. They were Croatia (on RTL Televizija), Greece (Alpha TV), Serbia (Prva TV) and Romania (PRO TV). On 4 July, Alpha TV started airing Glass Home, with the name \"\u0393\u03c5\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2\". However, the show received low ratings and Alpha TV stopped airing it after only six episodes, on July 10, 2011. In Croatia, the series started in July 2011, and in Serbia and Romania the dates are yet to be announced. Later the same year, bTV announced that Kanal 5 (in Macedonia) has bought the rights for the \"Season of the Bulgarian TV Series\" (Including Glass Home, Too Many Metropolitans (lit. translation) and 7 hours of time difference (lit. translation) and the most successful Bulgarian film, Mission London (also produced by bTV). Since then, the series has been a big commercial success. ==External links== * Category:2010 Bulgarian television series debuts Category:Bulgarian television series Category:2012 Bulgarian television series endings Category:2010s Bulgarian television series ",
