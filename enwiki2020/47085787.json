Distinguished from military chaplains who served the military or civilians as spiritual guidance (non-combatants), these priests took up arms and fought in conflicts (combatants). The term warrior priests is usually used for armed priests of the antiquity and Middle Ages, and of historical tribes. ==History== In Greek mythology, the Curetes were identified as armed priests. In Ancient Rome, the Salii who were armed priests carried sacred shields through the city during the March festivals. Livy (59 BC\u201317 AD) mentions armati sacerdotes (armed priests). Medieval European canon law said that a priest could not be a soldier, and vice versa. Priests were allowed on the battlefield as chaplains, and could only defend themselves with clubs. The Aztecs had a vanguard of warrior priests who carried deity banners and made sacrifices on the battlefield. A Cherokee priest who killed during battle received the title of Nu no hi ta hi. The warrior-priest was a common figure in the First Serbian Uprising (1804\u201313). Several archpriests and priests were commanders in the uprising. Serbian Orthodox monasteries sent monks to join the ranks of the Serbian Army. ==Legacy== The \"Pyrrhic\" dance in Crete is said to have been the ritual dance of armed priests. ==Notable groups== *Chivalric military orders, Christian religious societies of knights of the Catholic Church in feudal Europe such as the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, the Teutonic Knights and many others. *S\u014dhei, Buddhist monks in feudal Japan *Shaolin Monk, Chen, Zen Buddhist monks in feudal China *Righteous armies , Korean guerilla fighters, including monks, who resisted the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398). *Sant Sipahi is a Sikh ideology, inspired by the lives of Sikh gurus, of a saint soldier who would adhere one's life in strict discipline both in mind and body. *Naga Sadhus, a militaristic sect of arms- bearing Hindu sannyasi. ==Notable people== ;Eastern Orthodoxy *Luka Lazarevi\u0107 (1774\u20131852), Serbian Orthodox priest, vojvoda (general) of the Serbian Revolution. *Matija Nenadovi\u0107 (1777\u20131854), Serbian Orthodox archpriest, commander in the Serbian Revolution. *Athanasios Diakos (1788\u20131821), Greek Orthodox priest, commander in the Greek War of Independence. *Mi\u0107o Ljubibrati\u0107 (1839\u20131889), Serbian Orthodox priest, fought in the Herzegovina Uprising. *Bogdan Zimonji\u0107 (1813\u20131909), Serbian Orthodox priest, active during the 1852\u201362 and 1875\u201378 uprisings in Herzegovina *Vukajlo Bo\u017eovi\u0107, Serbian Orthodox archpriest, fought in the Balkan Wars. *Jovan Grkovi\u0107-Gapon (1879\u20131912), Serbian Orthodox priest, guerrilla in Macedonia. *Tasa Konevi\u0107, Serbian Orthodox priest, guerrilla in Macedonia. *Mihailo Do\u017ei\u0107 (1848\u20131914), Serbian Orthodox priest, guerrilla in Potarje (1875\u201378). *Stevan Dimitrijevi\u0107 (1866\u20131953), Serbian Orthodox priest, guerrilla in Macedonia (fl. 1904). *Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107 (1907\u20131999), Serbian Orthodox priest, World War II Chetnik. *Vlada Ze\u010devi\u0107 (1903\u20131970), Serbian Orthodox priest, Yugoslav Partisan. ;Catholicism *Archbishop Turpin (d. 800), legendary (insofar as military accomplishments) member of Charlemagne's Twelve Peers. *Rudolf of Z\u00e4hringen (1135\u20131191), Catholic bishop, Crusader. *Joscius (d. 1202), Catholic archbishop, Crusader. *Reginald of Bar (fl. 1182\u20131216), Catholic bishop, Crusader. *Aubrey of Reims (fl. 1207\u201318), Catholic archbishop, Crusader. *Arnaud Amalric (d. 1225), Cistercian abbott, Crusader. *Bernardino de Escalante (1537\u2013after 1605), Catholic priest *Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Aldao (1785\u20131845), Dominican friar, General in the Argentine War. *Cresconius, (c. 1036\u20131066), Bishop of Iria, Spanish bishop who fought Vikings raiders *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos (1765\u20131815), Roman Catholic priest, Mexican independentist commander. *Camilo Torres Restrepo (1929-1966), Colombian socialist guerrilla and Catholic priest *Gaspar Garc\u00eda Laviana (1941-1978), Catholic priest inspired by Liberation theology to join the Sandanista revolution as a guerrilla soldier *Odo of Bayeux (d. 1097), Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror *Stanis\u0142aw Brz\u00f3ska (1832-1865), Polish Catholic priest, head chaplain and one of the generals in January Uprising *John Murphy (priest) (1753 \u2013 c. 2 July 1798), Irish Catholic priest and one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.
