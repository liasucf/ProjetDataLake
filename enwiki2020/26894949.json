All races counted with no discards allowed. The boats were awarded points in every race, six to one in in-port races and 30 to 5 points (30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5) for ocean races (legs). The race had a total of nine ocean legs and ten in-port races. Due to piracy the legs to and from Abu Dhabi were given two scores with the same total as the other legs. The scores were to be divided 80+20% and 20+80% respectively. In addition to the ocean and in-port races, there were no-score pro-am races in every port where sponsors and guests were given an experience as close to that of true professional sailing as possible.Volvo Ocean Race 2011-12 racing schedule ===Summary=== The race began in Alicante on 29 October 2011 and ended in Galway on 7 July 2012.\"Volvo Ocean Race 2011/2012: Route\" . volvooceanrace.com.
