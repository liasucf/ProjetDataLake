    "text": "Merlin James (born 1960 in Cardiff, Wales) is an artist living and working in Glasgow, Scotland. ==Life and work== James studied at Central School of Art and Design, London, and the Royal College of Art, London. His college thesis, on French artist Jean H\u00e9lion, led to H\u00e9lion introducing him to London's Albemarle Gallery and subsequently to James' first solo exhibition there in 1990. James moved from London to Glasgow in 2004. Of roughly the same generation as the Young British Artists, James is perhaps unusual in making work on the model of the traditional easel picture. It frequently takes the form of small-scale paintings on stretched canvas or polyester, sometimes incorporating artist-made frames.Barry Schwabsky and Morgan Falconer et. al., Vitamin P2, Phaidon, London, 2011. He also makes drawings and prints. As a critic Merlin James has published widely, including many articles and contributions to books and catalogues. In 2002 he became the first to hold the Alex Katz Visiting Chair in Painting at Cooper Union.James, Merlin. \"Painting per se\" lecture delivered at Cooper Union Great Hall, New York, 28 February 2002.
