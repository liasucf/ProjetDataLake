The character first appeared in Thor #132 (September 1966) and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Kurt Russell portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), where the character is reimagined as a Celestial and Peter Quill's father. ==Publication history== Ego the Living Planet was initially introduced in The Mighty Thor #132 (September 1966), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Ego was created by Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the expanse of the universe. Ego, the alien Kree, and The Colonizers immediately followed the creation of Galactus, thus establishing Marvel Comics' own \"space age mythology\". Reprinted in As Kirby recalled in 1969, shortly after the character's debut, Ego's genesis came when: The reader's first glimpse of Ego on the last page of Thor #132 is a full-page splash panel photo collage with Ego's human features superimposed on a bulbous, chaotic planetoid. Kirby had been using photo collages for several years; this image has been called \"his most effective and freakish to date.\" Ego returned as a protagonist in Thor #160\u2013161 (Jan.\u2013Feb. 1969), and made a guest appearance in #201. His origin is explored in Thor #228. Following appearances in Fantastic Four #234\u2013235 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1981) and Rom #69 (Aug. 1985), Ego had a recurring role in Silver Surfer vol, 3 #4\u201322 (1987\u20131989). The character returned in the 1991 Thor annual and issues #448\u2013450 (June\u2013Aug 1992).

Marvel Comics. Ego began absorbing space vessels and even planets to survive, and planned to produce armies of Anti-bodies to conquer worlds across the universe. This behavior attracted the attention of the Rigellian Colonizers, who feared that the nearby Ego would consume their home world. They recruited the Thunder God, Thor, to defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian Recorder, Thor encountered Ego and stunned him with a powerful storm. Feeling humiliated by his defeat, Ego vowed never to leave the Black Galaxy and renounced his plans of conquest.Thor #132\u2013133 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1966). Marvel Comics. Several months later, a weakened Galactus invaded Ego's space and sought to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aided Ego in battling Galactus and drove Galactus off. In gratitude, Ego allowed its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers; a group of various alien races whose planets had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.Thor #160\u2013161 (Jan.\u2013Feb. 1969).

Assisted by ally, Hercules and Galactus's herald, Firelord, Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.Thor #227\u2013228 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics. === 1980s === Years later, Ego gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth, seeking vengeance. Unable to locate him, Ego attacks Earth.

Ego-Prime then joins Eternity Watch, a group Galactus has put together to deal with the First Firmament, the first iteration of all that is, who had chained Eternity.The Ultimates 2 #8 ==Powers and abilities== The living planet named Ego has been called a \"bioverse\". Every part of its substance, including the atmosphere, is alive as much as it is controlled by the consciousness of Ego. It often transforms its surface to appear as a giant face to address powerful beings and can shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. Ego can use its substance to display plant-like growth, manipulate its own weather for heavy winds or storms, and the ground to generate earthquakes, volcanoes, geysers, and canyons, create a protective shield of solid clouds to defend from space attacks, extrude tentacles that reach out into space, and produce vast numbers of Antibodies, which are powerful, non-sentient humanoids that it mentally commands. Ego can also transform its surface into a dead world or a beautiful paradise to lure unwary space travelers to its surface, whom it promptly consumes. It has various internal features similar to a biological lifeform, like large tunnels that have been compared to arteries and its consciousness is inside a giant, brain- like organ deep below its surface. Ego can raise its internal temperature to burn life forms inside, has digestive organs to absorb living beings, and an immune system that lets him release the previously mentioned Antibodies to attack intruders on or below its surface.

Marvel Comics. and communicate to sentient beings using telepathy. If its energy reserves are depleted, Ego can restore them by devouring planets, tapping into stars, or digesting large numbers of living beings. Its psionic abilities are also how it controls its biosphere. Additionally, Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. For a while, Ego was propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on its south pole, but eventually gained control of it through its vast mental powers, allowing it to travel through hyperspace at enormous speeds. However, the device was later removed,Fantastic Four #234\u2013235 (Sept \u2013 Oct 1981). Marvel Comics. and it does not need the engine to travel anymore. ==Other versions== ===Amalgam Comics=== In the Amalgam Comics published jointly by Marvel Comics and DC Comics, Oa the Living Planet, an amalgamation version of Ego and DC's Planet Oa, was featured under the Amalgam Comics imprint in Iron Lantern #1, where he is the source of power for the Green Lantern Corps.

To achieve this, Ego mates with various species until a suitable offspring would be conceived to help put his plan into action. The only suitable child turns out to be Peter Quill, although he rebels when Quill learns that Ego killed Quill's mother to eliminate the distraction she would have posed to his plan. In the end, Quill and the Guardians of the Galaxy destroy Ego. ===Video games=== * Ego the Living Planet appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes, on the game's main menu screen.\"Lego Marvel Super Heroes preview and interview \u2013 from Iron Man to Squirrel Girl\".
