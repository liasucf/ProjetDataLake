    "text": "KTCJ-LD channel 50 was a digital low-power television station in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Its main affiliation is with the Cornerstone Television network. It broadcasts with a 15 kW signal from its Arden Hills, Minnesota tower, which it shares with sister station KHVM-LD channel 48, a Global Christian Network affiliate, and Daystar Television Network affiliate WDMI-LD channel 62. The station's tower was hit by lightning around Memorial Day 2010, forcing both KHVM-LD and KTCJ-LD to go silent (WDMI converted from analog to digital about the same time). The station has been off air since August, 2017. ==References== == External links == * CTVN official site * EICB website * RabbitEars.info website * tvfool.com * * Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:Television stations in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul ",
