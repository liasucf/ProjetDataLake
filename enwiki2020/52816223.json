The first officer commanding was Commandant A.H. Guy. The members continued to wear Transvaal Scottish buttons and shoulder titles but now wore artillery cap badges and collar badges. The regiment was equipped with two eight-gun batteries of 5.5 inch guns. This 7 Medium Regiment was disbanded on 28 February 1960. ===Rebirth of 7 Medium Regiment=== With the reorganization of the Artillery Corps in 1974, it was decided to once again establish a medium regiment and this became the 7 Medium Regiment SAA (fd), a Citizen Force unit with its headquarters once again in Benoni. Amongst others this new unit comprised members from Regiment Laeveld (previously known as 2nd Medium Regiment) from Nelspruit, which formed the nucleus of the ranks when it was the 7th Field Regiment based in Pretoria under command of Commandant J.E. Coetzee. SADF 7 Medium Artillery Regiment SAA beret badge and backing ===Operations=== The regiment saw action during several operational tours of the Border War.
