    "text": "\"Bootylicious\" is a song by American girl group Destiny's Child from their third studio album Survivor (2001). It was written and produced by Rob Fusari, Beyonc\u00e9 and Falonte Moore. The song contains a prominent sample from the Stevie Nicks song \"Edge of Seventeen\". The song was released as the album's second single from the album in 2001 and became the group's fourth US number- one single. It also reached the top five in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. A \"Rockwilder\" remix of the song featured Missy Elliott and appeared on the soundtrack of the 2001 musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera and the 2002 compilation This Is the Remix. Although the term \"bootylicious\" was first used in song by rapper Snoop Dogg in 1992 (in the Dr. Dre song Dre Day), the popularity of this song caused the slang word to become widespread and it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary (defined as \"(of a woman) sexually attractive\") in 2004. == Background and composition == \"Bootylicious\" was written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9, Rob Fusari and Falonte Moore, and was recorded at Sugarhill Studios, Houston, and Sound on Sound Studios, New York City. There are conflicting stories about the song's origins. According to Knowles, she was inspired to write the song on a flight to either London or Japan as she was listening to the guitar riff of Stevie Nicks' song \"Edge of Seventeen\", which reminded her of a \"voluptuous woman\". According to Fusari, he wanted to build a track on a sample of Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\". Unable to locate the song, he chose to sample \"Edge of Seventeen\" instead. He wanted to replay the guitar riff himself in the studio so as not to lose publishing royalties, but group manager Mathew Knowles (father of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles) would not let him do this. He reportedly later told Fusari in response to Beyonc\u00e9's claims of coming up with the idea to use the Stevie Nicks sample for the song, \"People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, NJ. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.\" Kelly Rowland has mentioned that \"Bootylicious\" is the most irritating Destiny's Child song for her since she has heard it too many times. Rowland sings the majority of the lead vocals on the track, with her leading both verses, Knowles leading choruses, and Michelle Williams leading the bridge. According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, \"Bootylicious\" is a pop song set in common time with a medium funk tempo of 104 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D minor), and Destiny's Child's vocals span from G3 to B5. == Chart performance == \"Bootylicious\" debuted at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 9, 2001 and climbed to its peak position nine weeks later, though it remained on the chart for a further nineteen weeks. To date, this remains the last song by a girl group to top the U.S. charts. The song peaked at number five on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and number two on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, behind Mariah Carey's \"Loverboy\". In the United Kingdom, \"Bootylicious\" was released on July 23, 2001 and debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart behind the Atomic Kitten cover single \"Eternal Flame\". It sold over 169,000 copies and propelled Survivor back to the top of the UK Album Chart. == Remixes == A hip hop-styled remix (the \"Rockwilder Remix\") was produced by Rockwilder, Knowles, and Missy Elliott. This version was issued to urban markets, and had a hip-hop culture-based music video to accompany it, in which Beyonc\u00e9 wears a belt that has the word \"Bootylicious\" misspelled as \"Bootyliciuos\", as pointed out by Carson Daly on an episode of TRL. A combination of the R&B; vocals from this song and the grunge rock music of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is one of the best-known examples of the \"bastard pop\" or \"mashup\" genre, where elements from seemingly incompatible songs are mixed together. A later mashup used the music of Stevie Wonder's \"Superstition\" with the \"Bootylicious\" vocals. == Music video == The music video for \"Bootylicious\", directed by Matthew Rolston and filmed from May 7\u20139, 2001, showed Destiny's Child performing dance steps from Michael Jackson's famous \"Billie Jean\" performance from the special Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. During the video, moves from several other Michael Jackson videos can be seen such as parts of the choreography from \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", \"Bad\", and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\". Dance moves that were used by Jackson during live performances of \"They Don't Care About Us\" can be seen as well. As the group is dancing, the members appear in several different costumes. These scenes are interloped with the group dancing in front of a dance troupe made of all boys. The dance sequence ends with a diamond-shaped stage where the group appears wearing pink crop-tops, while the all-male dance troupe appears shirtless, wearing Michael Jackson's signature one glove and sagging pants that showed their underwear with \"Destiny\" at the back. Stevie Nicks makes an appearance in the beginning of the song's video. Solange Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9's sister, also makes a brief cameo in the video. The version of the song featured in the music video is slightly different from the album version, removing the synth strings and DJ scratching and percussion fills in favour of a drier mix, with the bass guitar cut out part-way through the final choruses and a fade-out of the instrumental leaving only the vocals near the end. This version was never commercially released. The music clip is featured on the DualDisc edition of the album #1's and as an enhanced video on the UK and French editions of the Single. The video for the \"Rockwilder Remix\" featuring Missy Elliott is available on the Single \"Emotion Bootylicious Survivor \u2013 The Urban Remixes\". == Live performances == Destiny's Child opened the 1st Annual BET Awards with a performance of \"Bootylicious\". They performed it on both Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special concerts. According with Kelly Rowland, he liked this song so much, and when he saw them for the first time, he started to sing it, and they got very surprised. On February 3, 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 performed the song along with Kelly and Michelle during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. They also performed Beyonce's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" == Cultural impact== The song created moderate controversy, in a time when late 1990s and early 2000s music was pushing the boundaries of female sexuality. Destiny's Child was claiming \"G-rated fun\" and confidence in body image through the lyrics, yet the music video suggested much more with the group wearing much make-up, form-fitting clothes, performing sexually suggestive dancing, and the video featuring close-ups on several dancers' buttocks. The group later performed the song in front of Jackson for his 30th Anniversary concert, complete with their rendition of his dance moves. Before the premiere of the video on MTV's Making the Video, the girls dedicated the video to Michael Jackson. The song popularized the portmanteau term \"bootylicious\", a combination of the words booty and delicious, although the term had already been used by Snoop Dogg in the song \"Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')\" (aka \"Dre Day\" from Dr. Dre's 1992 album The Chronic) as a pejorative. Bootylicious is also mentioned by a character named Champ in the 1993 \"Homey, Don't Ya Know Me?\" episode of A Different World. The term was also used previously in the 1999 video game Duke Nukem: Time to Kill as the name of a strip club. The success of the song came after the rise in media visibility of voluptuous personalities like Jennifer Lopez. There was a media perception that the appearance of these women corresponded to an appreciation of the supposedly neglected larger hips and thighs common in the figures of black and Latina women. The approving neologism \"bootylicious\" has entered the mainstream English language as part of the crossover of African- American popular culture, fashion, and sexual politics. == Recognition == In September 2011, VH1 ranked \"Bootylicious\" number 19 on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. == Credits and personnel == *Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles \u2013 vocals, writer, producer *Kelly Rowland \u2013 Lead vocals *Michelle Williams \u2013 vocals, mixing *Rob Fusari \u2013 writer, producer *Falonte Moore \u2013 writer, producer *Stevie Nicks \u2013 writer *Dan Workman \u2013 engineering *Tony Maserati \u2013 mixing *Flip Osman \u2013 mixing assistance :Source: == Track listing and formats == European/Australian CD Single # \"Bootylicious\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Survivor\" (Jameson Full Vocal Remix) \u2013 6:18 # \"Survivor\" (Digital Black-N-Groove) \u2013 3:58 # \"Survivor\" (CB200 Club Anthem Mix) \u2013 6:21 # \"Independent Women Part 1\" (Live at The Brits 2001) \u2013 3:52 European 2-Track CD Single COL 671393 1 # \"Bootylicious\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:27 # \"Bootylicious\" (Ed Case Remix) \u2013 4:45 European Enhanced CD Single COL 671393 2 # \"Bootylicious\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:27 # \"Bootylicious\" (Ed Case Remix) \u2013 4:45 # \"Bootylicious\" (M&J;'s Jelly Remix) \u2013 3:40 # \"Bootylicious\" (Music Video) UK Enhanced CD Single Part 1 # \"Bootylicious\" (Album Version) # \"Bootylicious\" (Ed Case Remix) # \"Cards Never Lie\" # \"Bootylicious\" (Music Video) US CD Single # \"Bootylicious\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:27 # \"Bootylicious\" (Richard Vission's V-Quest) \u2013 6:08 US CD Maxi Single # \"Bootylicious\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:27 # \"Bootylicious\" (Richard Vission's V-Quest) \u2013 6:08 # \"Bootylicious\" (Richard Vission's DJ Dub) \u2013 5:29 # \"Bootylicious\" (Big Boyz Remix) \u2013 3:32 # \"Bootylicious\" (Case Remix) \u2013 4:46 US Vinyl Side A # \"Bootylicious\" (Richard Vission's V-Quest) # \"Bootylicious\" (Richard Vission's D.J.
