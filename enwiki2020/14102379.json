The Bills played in the Eastern division, winning six games, losing eight, and missing the postseason. The Bills didn't have a winning record at any point in the season; they played their final five games of the season on the road. ==Season summary== The Bills had a problematic quarterback situation, with former Redskin M.C. Reynolds, second-year Bills QB Johnny Green and ex-Lion Warren Rabb all struggling at the passer position. None completed more than 46% of their passes, and only Reynolds had a winning record (2\u20131) and threw for more than 1,000 yards.Pro-Football-Reference.com: 1961 Buffalo Bills Punter Billy Atkins led the league in punts, with 85; he also led the league with 44.5 yards per punt. Atkins also played safety for the Bills in 1961, and led the league with 10 interceptions, and was 2nd-Team All-AFL on defense.Pro-Football-Reference.com: 1961 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards Middle linebacker Archie Matsos was 1st-Team All-AFL for the second consecutive year, as was defensive tackle Chuck McMurtry.

Four of their first seven picks\u2014Rice, Shaw, Barber and Bemiller, all offensive linemen\u2014would go on to make at least one All-AFL team in the next five years. This draft would form the nucleus for the Bills' power running game over the next five years. Rice was All-AFL as a rookie in 1961. {| |- |style=\"background-color:#FFCC00; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"| |= All-AFL Players are identified as All-AFL if they were selected to the All-AFL at any time in their career. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"width: 80%\" |- !style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\" width=15%| Round !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Player !!width=15% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Position !!style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| College |- |align=center| 1 || bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Ken RiceKen RiceAll-AFL 1961|| Tackle || Auburn |- |align=center| 2 || bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Billy ShawBilly Shaw8x AFL All-Star|| Tackle || Georgia Tech |- |align=center| 3 || Art BakerArt Baker || Fullback || Syracuse (from New York) |- |align=center| 3 || Tom GilburgTom Gilburg || Tackle || Syracuse |- |align=center| 4 || bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Stew BarberStew Barber 5x AFL All-Star || Tackle || Penn State |- |align=center| 5 || Norm SneadNorm Snead*4x NFL Pro Bowler for Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants || Quarterback || Wake Forest |- |align=center| 6 || Fred BrownFred Brown || Halfback || Georgia |- |align=center| 7 ||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"| Albert BemillerAlbert Bemiller 1965 AFL All-Star || Center || Syracuse |- |align=center| 8 || Charles LinningCharles Linning || Tackle || Miami |- |align=center| 9 || William MajorsWilliam Majors || Halfback || Tennessee |- |align=center| 10 || Don KernDon Kern|| Halfback || VMI |- |align=center| 11 || Roy WallRoy Wall|| Halfback || North Carolina |- |align=center| 12 || Floyd PowersFloyd Powers || Guard || Mississippi State |- |align=center| 13 || Tom CauseyTom Causey|| Offensive end || Louisiana Tech |- |align=center| 14 || Ron KostelnikRon Kostelnik*Inducted into Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame (NFL) in 1989 || Tackle || Cincinnati |- |align=center| 15 || Jerry FryeJerry Frye|| Offensive end || South Carolina |- |align=center| 16 || Vincent ScottVincent Scott || Offensive end || Maryland |- |align=center| 17 || Wayne WolffWayne Wolff || Tackle || Wake Forest |- |align=center| 18 || John BodkinJohn Bodkin || Guard || South Carolina |- |align=center| 19 || Charles BarnesCharley Barnes || Offensive end || NE Louisiana State |- |align=center| 20 || Everett CloudEverett Cloud || Halfback || Maryland |- |align=center| 21 || Larry VargoLarry Vargo || Offensive end || Detroit |- |align=center| 22 || Charles BakerCharles Baker || Tackle || Tennessee |- |align=center| 23 || William MackWilliam Mack || Halfback || Notre Dame |- |align=center| 24 || Frank JackunasFrank Jackunas || Center || Detroit |- |align=center| 25 || Jack HarbaughJack Harbaugh || Halfback || Bowling Green |- |align=center| 26 || Lorenzo StanfordLorenzo Stanford || Tackle || North Carolina A & I |- |align=center| 27 || Bob AllenBob Allen || Offensive end || Wake Forest |- |align=center| 28 || Jason HarnessJason Harness || Offensive end || Michigan State |- |align=center| 29 || Mike StockMike Stock || Halfback || Northwestern |- |align=center| 30 || William MartinWilliam Martin || Halfback || Minnesota |} ==Standings== ==Game-by-game results== The 1961 preseason was notable for the Bills as they became the only AFL (or NFL) team to lose to a CFL team, and it was the last game between the CFL and AFL/NFL met in history. ===Preseason=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
