    "text": "Youssef En-Nesyri (; born 1 June 1997) is a Moroccan professional footballer who plays for La Liga Spanish club Sevilla FC as a striker and for the Morocco national team. He spent his professional career in Spain, representing M\u00e1laga, Legan\u00e9s and Sevilla in La Liga. A full international for Morocco since 2016, he represented the nation at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. ==Club career== ===M\u00e1laga=== After starting his youth career at Mohammed VI Football Academy, En-Nesyri joined M\u00e1laga CF for a fee of \u20ac125,000 in 2015. Initially assigned to the Juvenil squad, he made his senior debut for the reserves on 16 April 2016, scoring the last in a 3\u20131 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n away win against Guadix CF. He netted back-to-back goals in the following three matches against CD Hu\u00e9tor T\u00e1jar, River Melilla CF and FC Vilafranca and went on to become an integral player for the reserve side which narrowly missed promotion to Segunda Division B. On 8 July 2016, En-Nesyri was included in first team manager Juande Ramos' pre-season squad, and scored a double in a 4\u20130 friendly win against Algeciras CF eight days later. On 23 August 2016, after scoring six goals during the pre-season, En-Nesyri agreed to a contract extension until 2020. Three days later he made his professional \u2013 and La Liga \u2013 debut, coming on as a late substitute for Keko in a 2\u20132 away draw against RCD Espanyol. En-Nesyri scored his first professional goal on 21 September 2016, netting the winner in a 2\u20131 home victory against SD Eibar, after coming on as a substitute for Charles. He contributed with four goals in 25 league appearances during the 2017\u201318 campaign, as his side suffered relegation. ===Legan\u00e9s=== On 17 August 2018, following Malaga's relegation from the La Liga, En-Nesyri signed a five-year contract with CD Legan\u00e9s in the main category. He scored his first goals in his ninth game, to earn a 2\u20132 home draw with nearby Rayo Vallecano in the first leg of the last 32 of the Copa del Rey on 30 October, and on 23 November he netted his first league goal, the only one of a victory also at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque against a Deportivo Alav\u00e9s team that was challenging for top spot. In late January to February 2019, En-Nesyri scored six goals in three games as Legan\u00e9s avoided defeat: a brace in a 2\u20132 draw with Eibar, the late winner at Rayo and then all three goals against Real Betis; this last result made him the first Pepinero to net a hat-trick in La Liga. ===Sevilla=== On 16 January 2020, Sevilla FC signed En-Nesyri from Legan\u00e9s for a reported \u20ac25 million, on a contract lasting to June 2025; the Andalusians had recently sold their strikers Moanes Dabour and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. He debuted two days later in a 2\u20131 loss at Real Madrid, as a 65th-minute substitute for Munir El Haddadi, and on his first start on 9 February he opened the scoring on a trip to RC Celta de Vigo with the same result. En-Nesyri made his debut in European competitions on 20 February 2020, in the UEFA Europa League last 32 first leg away to CFR Cluj in Romania. He scored the late equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw, that put his team through on the away goals rule. On 6 August 2020, he scored a goal in a 2\u20130 win over Roma in the round of 16. ==International career== After representing Morocco at under-20 level, En-Nesyri was called up to the full squad by manager Herv\u00e9 Renard on 22 August 2016, for friendlies against Albania and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. He made his debut against the former nine days later, starting in a 0\u20130 draw at the Loro Bori\u00e7i Stadium in Shkod\u00ebr. En-Nesyri was called up for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, and scored in the second group game in a 3\u20131 win over Togo. He was a late addition to the squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, at the expense of defender Badr Banoun. In the last group game against Spain at the Kaliningrad Stadium, he gave the team a late lead in a 2\u20132 draw. At the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, En-Nesyri scored the only goal of a win over the Ivory Coast to send the Atlas Lions into the last 16. There, he equalised against Benin as the game went to a penalty shootout, in which Saturnin Allagb\u00e9 saved from him to knock the Moroccans out. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|M\u00e1laga |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga |13||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||1 |- |2017\u201318 |25||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !38||5||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||41||5 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Legan\u00e9s |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga |31||9||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||11 |- |2019\u201320 |18||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!49!!13!!4!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!53!!15 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Sevilla |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga |18||4||2||0||6||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||6 |- |2020\u201321 |3||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||4||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!21!!5!!2!!0!!6!!2!!1!!0!!30!!7 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !108!!23!!9!!2!!6!!2!!1!!0!!124!!27 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |colspan=\"3\"|Morocco |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2016||5||0 |- |2017||9||1 |- |2018||7||5 |- |2019||10||3 |- |2020||2||1 |- !Total||33||10 |} ====International goals==== :Scores and results list Morocco's goal tally first. {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !Goal!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- | 1. || 20 January 2017 || Stade d'Oyem, Oyem, Gabon || || align=\"center\" | 3\u20131 || align=\"center\" | 3\u20131 || 2017 Africa Cup of Nations |- | 2. || 9 June 2018 || A.
