    "text": "The ESP Viper is an electric guitar manufactured by ESP Guitars. The ESP Viper has a shape similar to that of a Gibson SG, with slight variations; Vipers have a slight diagonal slope at the bottom and an asymmetrical front profile. The body is mahogany or alder. The neck is three pieces, with a rosewood fingerboard. As standard, it comes fitted with an EMG 81/85 pickup set. It has a scale length of 24.75\". The LTD Vipers that are made by ESP's sister line are lower cost and of different quality to the ESP Viper. LTD Vipers are made of less expensive materials and do not possess the same specifications as ESP Vipers (with the exception of the higher-end LTDs, having EMG 81/85 pickups like the ESP Viper). Unlike the ESP Viper line, the LTD line features a Viper with Seymour Duncan passive pickups. ==Standard features== The ESP Viper has a set-through neck, 24.75\" scale, a mahogany body and neck, ebony fingerboard, 42mm bone nut, thin U-neck contour, 24 XJ frets, black nickel Hardware, Gotoh Magnum Lock tuners, Gotoh TOM bridge and tailpiece, EMG 81 (B) / 85 (N) active p.u., and BLKS finish.
