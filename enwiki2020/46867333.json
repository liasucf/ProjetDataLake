Stoker's is known for selling moist snuff in 12oz tubs with a refillable can included. This tub is the equivalent to ten 1.2oz standard cans, but made cheaper through the bulk purchase. Single 1.2oz cans are available in select markets. The Stoker's can says that the Stoker's cut has more flavor. Stoker's is known for being a less expensive but good quality smokeless tobacco. The cans have a metal lid and a plastic base. ==History== Stoker's began as a family-run business by Fred Stoker, but is now run by Bobby Stoker. Fred Stoker began by producing and selling long-leaf tobacco in West Tennessee in the early 1900s. Eventually, this evolved into a mail-order bulk tobacco business. The company's first chewing tobacco, 24-C, was released in the 1940s. Differing from other manufacturers of chewing tobacco, Stoker's sells its chew in 16oz bags, compared to the standard 3oz, to offer a better deal to consumers. More recently, Stoker's has entered the dipping market. ==Varieties== ===Moist snuff=== *Long Cut Wintergreen *Long Cut Natural *Long Cut Straight *Long Cut Mint *Long Cut Cool Wintergreen *Fine Cut Wintergreen *Fine Cut Natural ===Chewing tobacco=== *24-C (8oz & 16oz) *L-50 (8oz & 16oz) like l50 *Apple (8oz & 16oz) *Peach (8oz & 16oz) *Black Wild Cherry (8oz & 16oz) *Fred's Choice (8oz & 16oz) *24-M (16 oz) *Tequila Sunrise (16 oz) *Wintergreen (16 oz) *Butternut (16 oz) *Tennessee Chew Original (3oz, 8oz & 16oz) *Tennessee Chew Moonshine (16 oz) *Red Supreme (3oz, 8oz & 16oz) ==References== ==External links== *StokersSnuff.com Category:Tobacco brands Category:Chewing tobacco brands ",
