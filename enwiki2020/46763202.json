    "text": "TSV Schilksee is a German association football club from the Schilksee suburb of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein. The club's greatest success has been promotion to the tier four Regionalliga Nord in 2014, following a league championship in the Schleswig-Holstein-Liga. The club also offers other sports like European handball, swimming and table tennis. ==History== Formed in 1947 TSV Schilksee played the majority of its history as a local amateur side. It dropped as far as the tier eight Kreisklasse A Kiel in the mid-2000s before rising through the league system again from 2009 onwards. The club won three promotions in four seasons, climbing from the Kreisklasse A via the Kreisliga and Verbandsliga to the tier five Schleswig-Holstein-Liga in 2013. The club finished eleventh in the league in its first season there before winning the league in 2014\u201315. The latter allowed the club to take part in the promotion round to the Regionalliga Nord, where it overcame Bremer SV and VfV 06 Hildesheim to win promotion.Schilksee feiert den Titel fupa.net, published: 17 May 2015, accessed: 22 May 2015 After just a season in the Regionalliga the club was relegated back to the Schleswig-Holstein-Liga in 2016, which was renamed Oberliga Schleswig-Holstein by the next season. Financial hardships and a loss of ability to be competitive led TSV to withdraw from league football in 2019 after an automatic relegation from the Oberliga for withdrawing from the league and missing three match days. TSV's results were expunged from the league table. The club's now defunct women's team twice took part in the DFB-Pokal, in 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, reaching the second round once. ==Honours== The club's honours: * Schleswig-Holstein-Liga ** Champions: 2015 * Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord-Ost ** Champions: 2013 ** Runners-up: 2012 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Historic German football league tables Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv, accessed: 22 May 2015TSV Schilksee at Fussball.de accessed: 22 May 2015 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#dfdfdf\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- align=\"center\" | 2003\u201304 | align=\"left\"| Bezirksliga 4 | VI | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 15th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2004\u201305 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Kiel | rowspan=2| VII | 13th |- align=\"center\" | 2005\u201306 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Kiel | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 15th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2006\u201307 | align=\"left\"| Kreisklasse A Kiel | VIII | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 3rd \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2007\u201308 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Kiel | VII | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 15th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2008\u201309 | align=\"left\"| Kreisklasse A Kiel | rowspan=2| VIII | 7th |- align=\"center\" | 2009\u201310 | align=\"left\"| Kreisklasse A Kiel | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 1st \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2010\u201311 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Kiel | VII | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 2nd \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2011\u201312 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord-Ost | rowspan=2| VI | 2nd |- align=\"center\" | 2012\u201313 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein-Nord- Ost | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 1st \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2013\u201314 | align=\"left\"| Schleswig-Holstein-Liga | rowspan=2| V | 11th |- align=\"center\" | 2014\u201315 | align=\"left\"| Schleswig-Holstein-Liga | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 1st \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2015\u201316 | align=\"left\"| Regionalliga Nord | IV | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 18th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2016\u201317 | align=\"left\"| Schleswig-Holstein-Liga |rowspan=3| V | 8th |- align=\"center\" | 2017\u201318 | align=\"left\"| Oberliga Schleswig-Holstein | 12th |- align=\"center\" | 2018\u201319 | align=\"left\"| Oberliga Schleswig-Holstein | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 16th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2019\u201320 | colspan=3 | inactive |} * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.
