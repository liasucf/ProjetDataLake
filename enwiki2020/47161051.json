    "text": "The 2015\u201316 FC Basel season was the 123rd season in club history and the club's 21st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football. Basel were the reigning Swiss Super League champions. They prepared their season with various warm-up matches against teams from Ukraine, Germany and Netherlands. Their 2015\u201316 Swiss Super League season began on 19 July with a home game against Vaduz. By the winter break, having won fourteen and drawing one of the first 18 games, Basel led the league table by 10 points ahead of the Grasshoppers and 15 ahead of the Young Boys. Basel were qualified for the 2015\u201316 Champions League in the Third qualifying round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 17 July 2015 and they were drawn against Lech Pozna\u0144. The first leg was played on 28 July in INEA Stadion, the return leg on 5 August 2015 in St. Jakob-Park. In the Play-off round, their opponents were Maccabi Tel Aviv, but Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League groups stage. Because Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, they dropped into the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League group stage, where were drawn into Group I alongside Fiorentina, Lech Pozna\u0144 and Belenenses. Basel's first match was played away in Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence on 17 September 2015. Because they finished as group winners, Basel continued in the knockout phase (which started in February 2016), playing an away game against Saint- \u00c9tienne. In the round of 16, Basel played Sevilla, losing 0\u20133 on aggregate. In the first round of the 2015\u201316 Swiss Cup, which was played on 15 August 2015, Basel were drawn away against Meyrin FC, winning 4\u20130. In the second round, played on 20 September 2015, Basel were drawn away against YF Juventus, winning 4\u20131. Then in the third round, played on 28 October, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz, winning 5\u20131. The fourth round was played on 13 December 2015, where Basel lost away at the Stade Tourbillon against Sion after a penalty shootout. == Club == === Management === Paulo Sousa quit his Trainer position in Basel at the end of the 2014\u201315 season. On 18 June 2015, Basel announced that Urs Fischer had signed a three-year contract as first team manager. His assistants are Marco Walker and Markus Hoffmann. Massimo Colomba remained the Goalkeeper coach. Massimo Ceccaroni is head of the FCB Youth System. Coach of the Youth Team (U\u201321) was Thomas H\u00e4berli until October, at which time, due to the bad results, he had to step back and then Ceccaronii coached the team. === Further information === The FC Basel AGM took place on 27 April 2015 in Basel's congress center. The board of directors under president Bernhard Heusler with vice-president Adrian Knup, sport director Georg Heitz, financial manager Stephan Werthm\u00fcller and marketing manager Ren\u00e9 Kamm, and the three directors Reto Baumgartner, Dominik Donz\u00e9 and Benno Kaiser were all willing to continue and they were all re-elected unanimously. ==Overview== ===Off-season and pre-season=== At the end of the 2014\u201315 FC Basel season four first team players left the club to continue their careers elsewhere. These were Fabian Sch\u00e4r to 1899 Hoffenheim, Fabian Frei to Mainz 05, Giovanni Sio to Rennes and Arlind Ajeti. Also no longer in the team for this season was Marco Streller, who retired from professional football. As mentioned above Urs Fischer was the new first team manager. Basel's biggest signings for the beginning of the new season were Daniel H\u00f8egh from Odense, Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107 from Internazionale, Michael Lang from Grasshopper and Marc Janko, who came in on a free transfer from Sydney FC. Also new to the team are Manuel Akanji, who transferred in from FC Winterthur, and Mirko Salvi, who returned from his one-year loan to FC Biel-Bienne. Because Streller retired, Mat\u00edas Delgado was named as captain; Marek Such\u00fd and Kuzmanovi\u0107 were named as his vice-captains. ===Mid-season break=== During the winter break, there were a number of changes to the Basel squad. Ivan Ivanov, who spent the last two years recovering from an injury, left the club by mutual consent. Also outwards were Zdravko Kuzmanovi\u0107, on loan to Udinese and Albian Ajeti, who never quite managed to enter into the first team; he transferred to FC Augsburg. Also Yoichiro Kakitani, who only played a minor role in manager Fischer's team, transferred back to Japan to rejoin Cerezo Osaka. However, the one transfer deal that made the most news was midfielder Mohamed Elneny's departure to English Premier League side Arsenal. There were also a few players on the inwards direction. As early as 8 December 2015, the club announced that Andra\u017e \u0160porar had signed a four-and-a-half-year contract up until the end of June 2020. Then, on 2 January 2016, the club announced it had signed Alexander Fransson, also on a four-and-a-half-year contract. Again, on 12 January, they announced that Renato Steffen had also joined them on yet another four-and-a-half-year deal. ===2016\u201317 off-season=== On 4 May, Basel announced that they had signed 18-year-old Paraguayan defender Bl\u00e1s Riveros on a five-year deal. Due to Riveros' commitments with the Paraguay national team at the upcoming Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, he will not be expected to join the Basel first team until the beginning of July. On 10 May, Basel also announced that they had signed Egyptian defender Omar Gaber from Zamalek on a four-year deal. ===The campaign=== ==== Super League ==== Basel's priority aim for the season is to win the league championship for the seventh time in a row. Basel's 2015\u201316 Swiss Super League season began well with a home victory on 18 July against Vaduz. In fact, they started the season very well, winning each of their first eight games, scoring 22 goals conceding 7. They suffered their first defeat in the Stade de Suisse 3\u20134 against Young Boys. Four of the next five games were won; the away game against Z\u00fcrich in Letzigrund ended in a 2\u20132 draw. Two defeats were followed by two victories. By the winter break, Basel led the league table with 43 points, 10 points ahead of the Grasshoppers and 15 ahead of the Young Boys. They had won 14 and drawing 1 of the first 18 games, scoring 43 goals and conceding just 20. Basel started the second half of the season with three straight wins, a further 2\u20132 draw against Z\u00fcrich and another three straight wins. In round 31, on 30 April, the home win against Sion gave Basel a 16-point lead in the league table with just five games left to play and thus the championship title. Basel ended the season with two defeats in the last three games, but won the championship with 83 points and were 14 points ahead of Young Boys and 29 points ahead of Luzern. Basel had won 26 games drawing five and had suffered five defeats; they had scored 88 goals, conceding 38. ==== Swiss Cup ==== Basel's clear aim for the 2015\u201316 Swiss Cup is to regain the title that they last won four seasons ago. In the previous three seasons they had ended the cup competitions as runners-up, in 2013 against Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich, in 2014 against Z\u00fcrich and the previous season 2015 against Sion. In the first round of this season's competition, which was played on 15 August 2015, Basel are drawn away against Meyrin FC, winning 4\u20130. In the second round, Basel were drawn away against YF Juventus, which was played on 20 September. Because of safety reasons, however, the game was not played at YF Juventus' home ground, the Utogrund, but instead at St. Jakob-Park. Then in the third round, played on 28 October, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz, marking the first time that these two teams played against each other. The game was played at the Sportplatz Margelacker with a stadium record crowd of 5,800. The match was a 5\u20131 win for Basel. The fourth round was played on 13 December 2015 away in the Stade Tourbillon against Sion, where Basel lost after a penalty shootout. ==== Champions League ==== Basel entered into this season's Champions League in the Third qualifying round. Their initial aim was to remain in the competition and reach the group stage. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 17 July 2015 and they were drawn against Lech Pozna\u0144 and in the play-off round against Maccabi Tel Aviv. ;Lech Pozna\u0144 (29 July 2015) The first leg was played in INEA Stadion. Basel took the lead as Michael Lang, in the 24th minute, scored after a corner taken by Luca Zuffi. Just two minutes later, however, Lech Pozna\u0144 equalized through Denis Thomalla. Although Shk\u00eblzen Gashi missed a penalty in the 67th minute, Marc Janko (77th minute) and Davide Call\u00e0 (92nd minute) completed the 3\u20131 away win. ;Lech Pozna\u0144 (5 August 2015) The return leg at St. Jakob-Park ended in a home victory for Basel. Birkir Bjarnason scored his first goal for his new club in injury time to give Basel a 1\u20130 win. ;Maccabi Tel Aviv (19 August 2015) The first leg was played in Basel. Eran Zahavi put Maccabi in the lead with their first chance, in the 31st minute. Basel were awarded a penalty in the 39th minute which captain Mat\u00edas Delgado netted to equalize. Breel Embolo scored in the 88th minute to give Basel a 2\u20131 lead, but Zahavi equalised six minutes into added time for Maccabi as the match ended 2\u20132. ;Maccabi Tel Aviv (19 August 2015) The return game had a sold out Bloomfield Stadium crowd of 13,350. Luca Zuffi gave the visitors an early lead with a free-kick in the 11th minute. Eran Zahavi's seventh goal of this season's competition levels the score in the 24th minute. Maccabi reached the Champions League group stage for the first time in a decade, progressed on the away goals rule. ==== Europa League ==== Because Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, they dropped into the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League group stage. The draw was held on 28 August 2015, 13:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco and Basel were drawn into Group I, together with Fiorentina, Lech Pozna\u0144 and Belenenses. ;Fiorentina (17 September 2015) Basel's first match was played away at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence. Fiorentina's new first team manager was Basel's ex-manager, Paulo Sousa. Nikola Kalini\u0107 scored a fourth-minute opener for Fiorentina and they held the lead until well into the second half of the game. Fiorentina captain Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez was sent off after 66 minutes and following his dismissal the Swiss club took charge and managed to draw level. Birkir Bjarnason beat Luigi Sepe with a low drive from the edge of the area on 71 minutes. Eight minutes later, Mohamed Elneny capped the fightback in style. His super-rising drive from outside the box completed the comeback success. With this 2\u20131 win, Basel extended their unbeaten run to five matches in Europe this term. ;Lech Pozna\u0144 (1 October 2015) The first home game in the Europa League group stage was against Lech Pozna\u0144, who had been opponents in the Champions League qualifying earlier in the season. Lech's Swiss midfielder Darko Jevti\u0107 was signed from Basel after a successful loan spell. The 22-year-old was born in Basel and came through the youth ranks at the Swiss club. The first half passed without much action, but the home team dominated. Icelandic midfielder Birkir Bjarnason brought a long ball down with his chest at the edge of the penalty area, kept his balance under pressure, and then turned a finish past Maciej Gostomski to give the hosts the lead after 55 minutes. In the 90th minute, Luca Zuffi made a cross from the right, Marc Janko controlled with his chest and laid off for the waiting Breel Embolo, who finished with a powerful low volley. The final score 2\u20130 was a deserved result. ;Belenenses (22 October 2015) The third game in the group stage was the home match against Belenenses. Basel took an early lead after 15 minutes, Mat\u00edas Delgado kicked an inswinging corner to the back post from the left and Michael Lang jumped highest to power his header into the goal from five metres. Belenenses leveled after 27 minutes with their first chance. A long ball forward was headed clear by Marek Such\u00fd, but it dropped to Lu\u00eds Leal, who was 25 metres from goal. He hammered a low volley into the bottom corner and the ball bounced to evade the dive of Germano Vailati. During the extra time of the first half, Leal ran clear on the right flank, rushed into the area, playing the ball across the face of goal to Kuca Miranda who had easyest of finishes, tapping in from just three metres. During the second half, Basel played forward non-stop but were unable to score the equalizer. Until this 1\u20132 defeat, Basel had been unbeaten this season, in the domestic league (nine games) and in Europe (six). ;Belenenses (5 November 2015) The return game against Belenenses was played in Est\u00e1dio do Restelo two weeks after the home game. Basel took early command, a first chance from Breel Embolo hit the post after nine minutes, and Basel continued to dominate their opponents entirely. But it was not until very nearly half time that their efforts were rewarded. In the 44 minute, Embolo was fouled in the penalty area by Filipe Ferreira, and Marc Janko scored from the spot. Embolo himself scored the second goal after being played free by Luca Zuffi's long deep pass into the penalty box which was flicked on by Janko. With this 2\u20130 victory, Basel avenged their matchday three loss. ;Fiorentina (26 November 2015) Basel's third and last home match in the Europa League group stage was the return game against Fiorentina. Paulo Sousa returned to St. Jakob-Park, but this time to the visitors' bench. Basel's first choice goalkeeper Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vacl\u00edk injured himself shortly before kick-off and was replaced by Germano Vailati. Federico Bernardeschi ended his personal run of 11 games without a goal with a first-half double (23 and 36 minutes) to give Fiorentina a two- goal lead. After 26 minutes, Facundo Roncaglia was punished with a red card after elbowing Breel Embolo in the face. Basel fought back into the game, with Marek Such\u00fd cutting the gap before half-time (40th minute) and Mohamed Elneny equalizing on 74 minutes. The game ended in a 2\u20132 and Basel advance as Group I winners after recovering from being two down. ;Lech Pozna\u0144 (10 December 2015) As written above, Basel were certain to finish top of the section before matchday six. For the last match in the group stage Basel had to travel to the INEA Stadion in Pozna\u0144. Lech Pozna\u0144 had already lost to Basel three times this season and only a win would have given them any chance of making it through Group I. Unable to play were defenders Manuel Akanji, Philipp Degen and Daniel H\u00f8egh (all due to injury), as well as Marek Such\u00fd, who was out suspended. Walter Samuel made his 100th UEFA club competition appearance playing this match. Reserve goalkeeper Germano Vailati was again Basel's starter because of first choice goalkeeper Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vacl\u00edk's injury. In the 44th minute, Vailati himself also suffered an injury as he played a long pass forward. Just before half-time, third-choice goalkeeper Mirko Salvi was introduced and made his professional debut for the club. Adonis Ajeti also made his debut for the club after coming on as a substitute at half-time in place of Michael Lang.Lech Pozna\u0144 vs. Basel - 10 December 2015 - Soccerway Jean-Paul Bo\u00ebtius scored the only goal five minutes after half-time, it was his first goal for the Swiss champions. Because Basel ended this stage as group winners, they continued (seeded in the draw) in the knockout phase, which started in February 2016. The draw for the round of 32 was held on 14 December 2015, where Basel were drawn against French side Saint-\u00c9tienne. The first leg was played on 18 February at 19:00 and the return leg in the St. Jakob-Park played on 25 February 2016 at 21:05. ;Saint-\u00c9tienne (18 February 2016) The first leg of the round of 32 was played in the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but without Basel supporters due to the high security alert following the terror attacks in Paris two months earlier. Basel came back from 2\u20130 down but ended up losing. Moustapha Sall in the fifth minute and K\u00e9vin Monnet-Paquet in the 39th minute put the hosts 2\u20130 in the lead. Then Walter Samuel started Basel's fight-back just before half-time in the 44th minute, becoming the second-oldest scorer in the UEFA Europa League at age 37 years and 332 days; he is surpassed only by Molde FK's Daniel Hestad, who scored at age 40 years and 98 days in this season's group stage. Marc Janko, via a penalty in the 56th minute, put Basel level and the guests pressed for their third goal. After a long clearance, however, defender Jean-Christophe Bahebeck scored for the hosts in the 79th against the run of play, and the final score ended 3\u20132 in favour of Saint- \u00c9tienne. ;Saint-\u00c9tienne (25 February 2016) The return game against was played a week later and Basel had to win to qualify for the next round. This was very apparent as Basel played forwards immediately and levelled the aggregate as midfielder Luca Zuffi curled in a 25-yard free-kick on 15 minutes. Saint- \u00c9tienne went close, but goalkeeper Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vacl\u00edk saved the shot from substitute Romain Hamouma. Both teams were later reduced to ten men: In the 82nd minute, Saint-\u00c9tienne midfielder Valentin Eysseric collected two quick yellow cards for a foul and then a clash with Renato Steffen, while Basel's 19-year-old attacker Breel Embolo followed him off the pitch for a second caution. Saint- \u00c9tienne thought they had won it when captain Moustapha Sall netted from close range with just one minute of regular time left, only for Zuffi to crash the ball home in added time to level the tie at 4\u20134 and send Basel through on away goals. ;Sevilla (10 March 2016) The first leg of the round of 16 was played in the Basel and Sevilla had not won a European away game all season, so the goalless draw in Switzerland represented an improvement. Three second-half saves from Basel goalkeeper Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vacl\u00edk kept the home team in contention, but reigning Europa League title holders Sevilla cannot be unhappy with a goalless draw in this first leg. Marc Janko jumped high to head Basel's first chance just a little bit wide as early as the seventh minute \u2013 easily Basel's best chance of the first half \u2013 with Sevilla dominating possession thereafter. Steven Nzonzi went quite close with headers at either end of the period, while \u00c9ver Banega twice found Coke with free-kicks but the Sevilla captain was unable to find the target from either position. Basel's resolve returned after the half time break, if not their composure, Birkir Bjarnason blazing off target from a loose ball after a Renato Steffen shot was blocked. The Icelandic midfielder then pulled a decent ball across from the right, only for substitute Adama Traor\u00e9 to scuff his attempted conversion. However, it could have been worse for the Swiss team but for Vacl\u00edk, who was very awake and saved with his feet after Nzonzi was played in and then kept out Kevin Gameiro's low drive, going to ground once more to repel Yevhen Konoplyanka as time ticked down. Midfielder Nzonzi's dismissal near the end of the game offered Basel hope, but Sevilla held firm. ;Sevilla (17 March 2016) The return game against was played a week later on 17 March 2016 at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes at the end of the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kevin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli advanced with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3\u20130 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 \u2013 the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season. == Players == === First team squad === The following is the list of the Basel first team squad.
