BAFTA subsequently amended its eligibility rules, removing the requirement for UK programmes to premiere in the UK. ==In Memoriam== *Andre Previn *Jacqueline Pearce *Peter Armitage *Bill Sellars *Wendy Beckett *Magenta Devine *Clive Swift *Windsor Davies *Grant McKee *Sandy Ratcliff *Richard Baker *Chris Pye *Luke Perry *Leslie Grantham *Mya-Lecia Naylor *Ernest Maxin *Monica Sims *Jeremy Hardy *Anthony Owen *Denis Norden *Jill James *Ray Galton *Rachael Bland *John Bluthal *Peter Tork *Leonie Jameson *Bernard Hepton *June Whitfield ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:British Academy Television Awards Category:2019 in British television Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom Category:2019 television awards ",
