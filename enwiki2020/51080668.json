The video consists of Brian and Tyler as racecar drivers and Tim McGraw as the owner of the cars. The drivers are friends at first but fight after Tyler puts Brian into the wall at the end of the second race. They reconcile after Brian spins Tyler out and ends up flipping Tyler's car. Brian then goes to help Tyler get out of the car. Tyler's car catches on fire then the car explodes with Tyler in it and his daughter says daddy and starts to cry, then Brian ends up pulling him out, against track official and firefighter orders. The video ends with Tyler asking Brian if he won with Brian responding \"We all Did\". The video has them acting only (without singing), the first FGL video to do so. The video was shot in Hohenwald, Tennessee. == Charts == ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard) | 41 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Country Airplay (Billboard) | 52 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard) | 51 |} == Certifications == ==References== Category:2016 songs Category:2016 singles Category:Florida Georgia Line songs Category:Tim McGraw songs Category:Republic Nashville singles Category:Vocal duets Category:Songs written by Rodney Clawson Category:Song recordings produced by Joey Moi Category:Music videos directed by TK McKamy Category:Country ballads Category:Republic Records singles Category:Billboard Country Airplay number- one singles ",
