He wrote widely about his ideas and in Finland was a prominent thinker.Henry Minde, Svein Jentoft, Harald Gaski, \"Indigenous peoples: self-determination, knowledge, indigeneity\", Eburon Uitgeverij B.V., 2008, p. 100.George C. Schoolfield, \"A history of Finland's literature\", U of Nebraska Press, 1998, p. 271. Linkola was a year- round fisherman from 1959 to 1995. He fished on Keitele, P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne and Gulf of Finland, and since 1978 he fished on Vanajavesi.Turtiainen, Pekka: Kalastaja. S\u00e4\u00e4ksm\u00e4ki: Voipaalan taidekeskus, 2015. Linkola blamed humans for the continuous degradation of the environment. He promoted rapid population decline to combat the problems commonly attributed to overpopulation. ==Life== Linkola was born on 7 December 1932. He grew up in Helsinki and summered in Kariniemi in at the farm of his maternal grandfather, Hugo Suolahti. His father, Kaarlo Linkola, was a botanist, phytogeographer, and the Rector of University of Helsinki, and his grandfather Hugo had worked as the chancellor of that same university. Linkola's half-brother, Anssi, was killed during the Continuation War against the Soviet Union in 1941, at the age of 20.Uutuuskirja paljastaa Pentti Linkolan suosion naisten keskuudessa: \u201dOlihan se imartelevaa miehiselle itsetunnolle\u201d Ilta-SanomatKirja-arvio: Tyylik\u00e4s el\u00e4m\u00e4kerta Pentti Linkolasta auttaa ymm\u00e4rt\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4n kuohuttavaa ekoeksentrikkoa Etel\u00e4-Suomen Sanomat One year after Anssi died, Kaarlo died of prostate cancer.Pentti Linkolan el\u00e4m\u00e4kerta paljastaa kolmiodraaman \u2013 kalastaja, kirjailija ja ajattelija on my\u00f6s naistenmies! Aamulehti Hugo then died in 1944 due to a heart attack. Linkola had an elder sister, Aira, and a younger brother, Martti. After he graduated from Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu in 1950, Linkola studied biology for half a year, then became a researcher. He lived in Signilsk\u00e4r in the \u00c5land Islands and made ornithological observations. Although he was one of Finland's most famous ornithologists, Linkola gave up his research career to live an austere life as a fisherman, as this was in line with his teachings. He was involved in the Koij\u00e4rvi Movement that started in 1979, but his views proved too radical for mainstream Green politics.Luonnonsuojelija ja toisinajattelija Pentti Linkola on kuollut \u2013 menehtyi 87-vuotiaana Kainuun Sanomat In 1995 Linkola founded the Finnish Nature Heritage Foundation (),Linkola, Can Life Prevail?: A Radical Approach to the Environmental Crisis (Budapest: Arktos, 2011). which concentrates on preserving the few ancient forests still left in southern Finland and other nature conservation. The foundation receives donations from private individuals and companies, then purchases forest areas deemed unique enough to deserve protection. By 2017, the foundation had purchased 62 protected areas, spanning in total. On the 101st anniversary of Finland's independence, Linkola was announced as the winner of a poll conducted by the national broadcaster Yle to determine who had done the most to preserve Finland's natural heritage.Keit\u00e4 ne on, ne luonnon sankarit? Kiitoksia saivat niin aktiivitoimijat kuin omat is\u00e4tkin. Yksi oli ylitse muiden... Yle Linkola was married from 1961 to 1975, and had two children. He died in his sleep at his home in S\u00e4\u00e4ksm\u00e4ki on 5 April 2020. ==Ideas== Linkola's views have been sometimes described as \"ecofascist\". He believed that democracy was a mistake, saying he preferred dictatorships, and only radical change can prevent ecological collapse. He contended that the human populations of the world, regardless if they are developed or underdeveloped, do not deserve to survive at the expense of the biosphere as a whole. Linkola, P., \"Humanflood\", trans. H. Heinonen & M. Moynihan. Originally published in Apocalypse Culture II, ed. A. Parfrey (Feral House, 2000). pp. 436\u2013451. In May 1994, Linkola was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal Europe. He said he was for a radical reduction in the world population and was quoted as saying about a future world war, \"If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating, if it meant millions of people would die.\" Linkola's writings describe in emotional detail the environmental degradation he witnessed. He dedicated his 1979 (From the Diary of a Dissident) to German far-left militants Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, stating that \"they are the signposts, not Jesus of Nazareth or Albert Schweitzer\". He supported acts of terrorism such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings as he viewed them as disruptions to a society that is responsible for the degradation of the Earth. When asked in 2007 why he had not himself become a terrorist, Linkola said that he lacked the ability and bravery.N\u00e4ist\u00e4 asioista Pentti Linkola muistetaan Ilta-Sanomat ==Reception== In the 2009 book Environmental Change and Foreign Policy: Theory and Practice, Mika Mervi\u00f6, Professor of International Relations at the Kibi International University, contended that while most environmentalists in Finland distanced themselves from Linkola, those concerned about the environment avidly read his writings. Mervi\u00f6 said that Linkola represents \"a very Finnish and dark version of 'an inconvenient truth'.\" After Linkola's death, the incumbent Minister for Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto and Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Krista Mikkonen, both from the Green League, expressed their condolences and praised Linkola's significant efforts for nature conservation. Haavisto said that Linkola had influenced generations of environmentalists, and while Linkola did not defend human rights, there never was disagreement about conservation. ==Works== * Linkola, Pentti & Olavi Hilden: Suuri Lintukirja.
