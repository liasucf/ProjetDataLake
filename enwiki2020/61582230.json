Born in Jamaica, he moved to England as a child where he began playing football and eventually joined Ossett Albion. In November 2015, he joined Swansea City and made his professional debut four years later. ==Early life== Garrick was born in Jamaica before his family settled in the village of Liversedge in Yorkshire, England. He attended Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton before studying sport and exercise science at Huddersfield New College. As a teenager, Garrick played football before taking up rugby league at the age of 16. He began playing rugby league for local amateur side Dudley Hill where the coach had ties to Bradford Bulls. He began training with the Bulls, playing as either a fullback or winger. Garrick came close to giving up football after the Bulls expressed an interest in signing him before being persuaded to keep playing by his mother and the manager of his amateur side. ==Club career== Garrick played for Northern Premier Division One side Ossett Albion before being encouraged by his coaches to attend a trial with Premier League side Swansea City. The two-week trial proved successful and he signed a two-year deal with the Welsh side, only a year since contemplating leaving football to pursue a rugby league career. He was initially assigned to the club's academy and under-21 development side where he scored eight goals in ten matches during his first season with the under-18s. He made his professional debut for the club as a substitute in place of Barrie McKay during a 3\u20131 victory over Northampton Town in the first round of the EFL Cup on 13 August 2019. He made his Football League debut a week later during a 3\u20131 victory over Queens Park Rangers, winning the penalty for his side's second goal. Garrick described his debut as emotional and stated \"I had a few tears in my eyes to be honest. It was emotional because it's been a long time coming\". He scored his first goal for Swansea in an EFL Cup tie against Cambridge United on 28 August 2019. ==Style of play== Garrick has described himself as a player with \"pace and skill\" and has credited his rugby league background with improving his physicality which he stated \"gave me an edge over some players who were older than me in non- league.\" == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Swansea City U23||2016\u201317||PDL |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2Appearances in EFL Trophy||0||2||0 |- ||2017\u201318||PDL |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3Appearances in EFL Trophy||1||3||1 |- ||2018\u201319||PDL |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3Appearances in EFL Trophy||1||3||1 |- |Swansea City |2019\u201320 |Championship |11||2||0||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !11!!2!!0!!0!!3!!1!!8!!2!!22!!5 |} ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Jamaican footballers Category:Ossett Albion A.F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football wingers ",
