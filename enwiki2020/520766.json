    "text": "The Batman Bridge is a modern road bridge that carries the Batman Highway across the Tamar River, between Whirlpool Reach, Hillwood at its eastern end and Sidmouth / Deviot midpoint at its western end, in north Tasmania, Australia. The bridge connects the Batman Highway with the West Tamar Highway (state route A7) and the East Tamar Highway (state route A8). The bridge overlooks the Deviot Sailing Club and is named in honour of John Batman, a Launceston businessman and co-founder of Melbourne. ==Design features== Built between 1966 and 1968, it was the first cable-stayed bridge in Australia and among the first such bridges in the world. The main span is long, suspended from a steel A-frame tower. The deck is wide. The tower is on the west bank of the Tamar river, on a solid dolerite rock base which carries 78% of the weight of the main span. The length of the bridge is between abutments. The east bank is soft clay not capable of supporting a bridge. A causeway carries the highway across this softer base, supported by four piers built on piles driven up to into the clay. The bridge deck is constructed of steel. ==Gallery== Batman Bridge, off Tamar Hwy, Tasmania.JPG|Batman Bridge, off Tamar Highway Batman_Bridge.jpg|View of the bridge from the Tamar River ==References== ==External links== * Side view of Batman Bridge shows slanted A-frame support tower. * * Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Australia Category:Road bridges in Tasmania Category:Bridges completed in 1968 Category:Tamar River Category:1968 establishments in Australia ",
