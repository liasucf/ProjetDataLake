    "text": "The 1972 Carolina 500 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing event that took place on March 12, 1972, at North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina. For most of the 1972 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season, Bobby Allison and Richard Petty were considered to be the most dominant of the full-time drivers. David Pearson and Buddy Baker were strong performers who unfortunately didn't compete in enough races to have a chance for championship glory. ABC tape-delayed coverage of this race until March 18, 1972, when it was shown as ABC Championship Auto Racing and abbreviated to 90 minutes including commercials. ==Race report== While the race took place on a paved track spanning , it took four hours and twenty-three minutes to complete all 492 laps of the race. Bobby Isaac defeated Richard Petty by at least one lap in front of 42500 people; marking his final career win. Isaac would earn the pole position with a qualifying speed of . Meanwhile, the average race speed was . Eight cautions slowed the race for 57 laps. Jimmy Vandiver finished in 3rd place with a ragtag crew of repairmen who had never worked a NASCAR race before and were assembled just hours before the race began; he improved on his qualifying position of 16th place even though he was unable to lead any laps. Baker only added this race at the last minute because there were so few other big teams. Baker broke a valve Spring in his 426 wedge and fell out early. Allison dominated the first half of the race and then blew up. Petty had several cut tires and finally broke a rear spring. That left Issac who was running a highly restricted 426 Hemi a clear path to the win. British-born competitor Jackie Oliver finished in last place due to an engine issue on the first lap while Canadian-born Les Covey would fail to finish due to a clutch problem on lap 127. The rest of the 40-car grid would have American-born drivers. NASCAR noticed that Allison's car had right side tires on the left side and vice versa after qualifying and told Junior to switch them, he wouldn't because NASCAR didn't even look at any other team, so they put the car in the back to start. Neil Castles would record his final top ten ever in his NASCAR Cup Series career. Only manual transmission vehicles were allowed to participate in this race; a policy that NASCAR has retained to the present day. Eight of NASCAR's most notable crew chiefs of the early-1970s made an appearance for this race; including Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Tom Vandiver and Lee Gordon. ===Qualifying=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
