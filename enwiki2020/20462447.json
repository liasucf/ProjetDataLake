SV Kickers Pforzheim website, accessed: 21 September 2011 ==History== The club was established in December 1906 as Fu\u03b2ball-Club Germania Br\u00f6tzingen. In 1913, it was merged briefly with Ballspielclub 05 Br\u00f6tzingen as BC Germania Pforzheim, but the union quickly fell apart. Following World War I, in 1920, several clubs including Turnverein Br\u00f6tzingen, KSV Achilles Br\u00f6tzingen, and Radfahrclub Sturm Br\u00f6tzingen joined with FC to create the current club.Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag FC enjoyed a steady string of successes in local play that soon saw the club promoted to the senior regional circuit, the Kreisliga S\u00fcdwest and then the Bezirksliga W\u00fcrttemberg- Baden, where they took part in qualification for the national playoff round in 1928\u201329. Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich into 16 top flight divisions, Br\u00f6tzingen became part of the Gauliga Baden. A poor campaign led to the club's demotion after their debut season, but they returned to the Gauliga to play three more seasons between 1935\u201338. After World War II, FC became part of the Amateurliga Nordbaden-S\u00fcd, later the Amateurliga Baden (II), where they fared poorly through the late 40s and 50s. The side improved in the 60s and enjoyed local title and cup wins on their way to promotion to the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) in 1968. FC was relegated after a 16th-place result there in 1971 and returned to the Bezirksliga (VIII) level. Spending its final four seasons at Kreisliga level, where the side achieved a second-place finish in 2011, the club eventually disappeared through a merger with 1. FC Eutingen to form SV Kickers Pforzheim on 1 July 2011. ==Honours== * Bezirksliga W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (I) ** Champions: 1929 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFussball.de \u2013 Ergebnisse Tables and results of all German football leagues {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- align=\"center\" | 2002\u201303 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga Mittelbaden | rowspan=5| VI | 9th |- align=\"center\" | 2003\u201304 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga Mittelbaden | 10th |- align=\"center\" | 2004\u201305 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga Mittelbaden | 7th |- align=\"center\" | 2005\u201306 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga Mittelbaden | 11th |- align=\"center\" | 2006\u201307 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga Mittelbaden | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 14th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2007\u201308 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Pforzheim | VII | 4th |- align=\"center\" | 2008\u201309 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Pforzheim | rowspan=3| VIII | 7th |- align=\"center\" | 2009\u201310 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Pforzheim | 4th |- align=\"center\" | 2010\u201311 | align=\"left\"| Kreisliga Pforzheim | 2nd |} * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.
