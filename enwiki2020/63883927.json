    "text": "Jovan Pa\u010du Jovan Pa\u010du (Aleksandrovo near Subotica, Austrian Empire, 17 March 1847 - Kikinda, Austrian Empire, 30 October 1902) was a Serbian composer and pianist. During his education in Subotica, he distinguished himself as a gifted pianist, and as early as 1863 he played at a public concert. In parallel with his study of medicine in Prague (which he also studied in Pest) he studied privately with Bed\u0159ich Smetana. He has played in Vienna, Budapest, Kiev (the first Serbian pianist in Imperial Russia), Belgrade, Osijek, Kikinda, Pan\u010devo, Vr\u0161ac and many places in Serbia and Vojvodina. With the inevitable salon virtuosity he stood out with his brilliant technique, and at concerts, he often performed works by Serbian composers, his contemporaries, as well as his own compositions and arrangements of folk tunes. Although using a very simple compositional technique, these works - on folk themes or in the folk spirit - were so popular that the people accepted them as their own (eg, \"Branko's Wheel\", created on the occasion of the transfer of Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107's bones from Vienna to Stra\u017eilovo in 1883).Pa\u010du's concerts had a great patriotic significance, especially in Hungary, where Serbs fought for their national rights. His compositions reflect, in addition to the romantic patriotic expression, the Biedermeier salon style of a brilliantly virtuoso character.Subotica.com; \u0408\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d \u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0452\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0459\u0435\u043d\u043e 26.10.2019.
