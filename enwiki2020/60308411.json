He founded the fashion company, Chocolate Clothes which started operating as a clothing line for women in March 2013 but grew into a men's wear and accessories brand and later got incorporated in 2018.

Chocolate does not only design clothes but also manages the production of custom-made shoes and sandals. The name Chocolate according to Kwaku is meant to drive more interest and craving in people towards his products, a revelation he made in an interview with CNN on African Start-up. == Works == Kwaku won the best fashion designer of the year award during the 2018 EMY Africa Awards. He also won the maiden edition of Tailored African Fashion 2018, a project by African Fashion Fund in collaboration with Joy FM.
