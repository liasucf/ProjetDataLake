Bowling was one of HBO's earliest programs, back when it debuted in the early 1970s. HBO's first bowling telecast was the Winston-Salem Open on June 10, 1973. About 21 PBA TV finals aired on HBO from June 1973 through July 1975. Dick Stockton, Marty Glickman, and Spencer Ross served as the play-by-play announcers and Skee Foremsky acted as the color commentator for the bowling telecasts. Pat Summerall also called at least one event, which was the 1975 Brunswick World Open. ==See also== *List of programs broadcast by HBO **HBO#Sports programming *PBA Tour#PBA Tour in the media ==References== ==External links== *HBO sports programming - Sports Video Group Category:Bowling television series Bowling Bowling Category:1973 American television series debuts Category:1976 American television series endings Category:HBO Shows (series) WITHOUT Episode info, list, or Article ",
