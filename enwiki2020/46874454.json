It was the 58th edition of the Milan\u2013San Remo \"monument\" classic race. ==Summary== The decisive attack was launched at 50 km from the finish by 20 riders, including Italians Felice Gimondi, Dino Zandeg\u00f9, Gianni Motta, Franco Bitossi and the previous year's winner, Eddy Merckx. Merckx, left without teammates in the breakaway, broke solo at 20 km from the finish, before being joined by Gianni Motta. After the descent of the Poggio, Gimondi and Bitossi returned to the two leaders, leading to a four-man sprint on the Via Roma. Merckx easily won the sprint, sealing his second Primavera victory, and also established a new record average speed. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- |1 | | | align=right| 6h 25' 40\" |- |2 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |3 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |4 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |5 | | | align=right| +4\" |- |6 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |7 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |8 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |9 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |10 | | | align=right| s.t. |} ==References== Category:Milan\u2013San Remo Milan-San Remo, 1964 Milan-San Remo Category:March 1967 sports events Category:1967 Super Prestige Pernod ",
