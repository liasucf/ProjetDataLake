    "text": "Kahana b. Ta\u1e25lifa, is a Jewish Talmudist who lived in Babylonia, known as an amora of the third century CE. He is mentioned only twice in the Babylonian Talmud; viz., in Men. 66b, where he refutes R. Kahana, and in 'Er. 8b, where he quotes a sentence of R. Kahana b. Minyomi, who seems to have been his teacher. Kahana b. Ta\u1e25lifa apparently emigrated to Palestine, perhaps in company with R. Zera; for Yer. 'Ab. Zarah ii.9 mentions him together with Zera and with Hanan b. Bo. This is not certain, however; for the passage reads: \"R. Zera, Kahana b. Ta\u1e25lifa, and Hanan b. Bo,\" which may be rendered also \"R. Zera Kahana\" (\"the priest\"), since Zera was a priest (Yer. Ber. iii. 5). On this assumption Bar Ta\u1e25lifa can not be identical with Kahana b. Ta\u1e25lifa. ==References== * Category:Talmud rabbis of Babylonia ",
