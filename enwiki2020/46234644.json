The pose is unknown in hatha yoga until the 20th century Light on Yoga, but the pose appears in the 1896 Vyayama Dipika, a manual of gymnastics, as the balancing movement exercise called jhula. Norman Sjoman suggests that it is one of the poses adopted into modern yoga in Mysore by Krishnamacharya. The pose would then have been taken up by his pupils Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar. == Description == The practitioner kneels with ankles crossed over each other allowing the buttocks to rest in the cradle of the heels. Places hands besides folded legs and leans forward slowly to curve back and shoulder blades pressing the shoulders towards the floor.
