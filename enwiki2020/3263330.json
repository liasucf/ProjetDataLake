Atrial fibrillation and J wave in a person with hypothermia A J wave \u2014 also known as Osborn wave, camel-hump sign, late delta wave, hathook junction, hypothermic wave, K wave, H wave or current of injury \u2014 is an abnormal electrocardiogram finding. J waves are positive deflections occurring at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment, where the S point, also known as the J point, has a myocardial infarction-like elevation. ==Causes== They are usually observed in people suffering from hypothermia with a temperature of less than 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), though they may also occur in people with high blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia), brain injury, vasospastic angina, acute pericarditis, or ventricular fibrillation and could also be a normal variant. ==History== The prominent J deflection attributed to hypothermia was first reported in 1938 by Tomaszewski. These waves were then definitively described in 1953 by John J. Osborn (1917\u20132014) and were named in his honor.Osborn JJ. Experimental hypothermia: Respiratory and blood pH changes in relation to cardiac function. Am J Physiol 1953; 175: 389-398. Over time, the wave has increasingly been referred to as a J wave, though is still sometimes referred to as the Osborn wave in most part due to Osborn's article in the American Journal of Physiology on experimental hypothermia.Serafi S, Vliek C, Taremi M (2011) \"Osborn waves in a hypothermic patient\" The Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives http://www.jchimp.net/index.php/jchimp/article/view/10742/html ==References== Category:Cardiac arrhythmia ",
