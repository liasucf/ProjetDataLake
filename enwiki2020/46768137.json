Shikondomboro came to the Finnish mission station of Nkurenkuru in early 1930 to work as an assistant in the mission kitchen under the leadership of Aatu J\u00e4rvineva. He converted to Christianity a few years later, and in 1935 he was sent to the seminary in Oniipa, Ovamboland, where he studied to become a teacher. Having finished the teacher training, he returned to Kavango, and worked as a teacher and evangelist. In 1942, he was ordained into priesthood, after which he continued to work in Kavango.Peltola 1958, p. 224. Shikondomboro is known to have visited Finland on at least one occasion.
