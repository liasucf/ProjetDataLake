    "text": "Here & Now Tour was a concerts tour by American singer Diana Ross from 1991 to 1992. It was a world tour that began in Asia where her album, \"The Force Behind the Power\" had gone gold. The tour was recorded live for a television special in Japan. The tour hit the English-speaking world in Australia with the second live recorded special from Perth. She landed in America, determined to play smaller markets like Syracuse and Poughkeepsie before sweeping across America. The summer dates were across Europe beginning in a continued 6 sold out Wembley/London across the continent as the 3rd single, \"One Shining Moment\" was hitting the Top 10. The Palais de Sportes in Paris was a highlight for two nights. The album continued to do well for the holidays when her huge Japanese hit \"If We Hold on Together\" became a European smash supported by the airing of \"Christmas in Vienna\" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. Television exposure had been key throughout this tour. Earlier in the spring, Diana was invited to close the entire \"Royal Command Performance for the Queen\". It was there her first single from the album was destined for #1! The Royal Command Performance once again was instrumental in making the song a hit. She returned to America to do second round dates in major markets like New York. The tour had successfully conquered North America (Canada dates were after the first run of New York dates), Asia, the English-speaking world and Europe for over 100 dates. ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20150710201051/http://www.dianaross.de/ * http://www.dianarossofficialfanclub.wordpress.com/concerts-tours/ Category:1991 concert tours Category:Diana Ross concert tours ",
