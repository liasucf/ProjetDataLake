    "text": "Aqua is the tallest building in the world designed by a woman. Aqua was designed by Jeanne Gang at Studio Gang Architects. This list ranks skyscrapers by height which were designed by women working as primary architects or design coordinators. Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures, including towers, are not included. (See List of tallest buildings and structures.) == Ranking criteria == This list includes all occupiable structures over tall, including spires, that were designed by women in the roles of primary architect or design coordinator. Note that many of these buildings are designed by larger teams that include the female architects listed. == Tallest buildings in the world designed by women (50m+) == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
