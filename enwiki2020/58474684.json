    "text": "The Great Country Songbook is a studio album by Australian country music singers Adam Harvey and Troy Cassar-Daley, released in June 2013. The album debuted at number 2 on the ARIA Charts, becoming the career highest charting album for both artists. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2013, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Country Album. The album was nominated for a number of awards at the 2014 Country Music Awards of Australia, but Cassar- Daley and Harvey withdrew their nominations after fellow artist John Williamson said the album was too \"American\" to be considered for an award. In a statement the duo said \"The conversations and debates about the album over the past few days has fragmented an already fragile music community. We are very proud of the achievements of the project, however wish to not have the album as part of the awards. We are just sad for country music that this has all happened. The last thing we wanted to do was cause any controversy. It was just two mates paying tribute to our musical heroes.\" ==Track listing== # \"Good Hearted Woman\" \u2013 4:44 # \"Mama's Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" \u2013 4:00 # \"Crystal Chandeliers\" \u2013 2:56 # \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" \u2013 3:21 # \"Lights On the Hill\" \u2013 3:12 # \"For the Good Times\" \u2013 3:50 # \"Coward of the County\" \u2013 4:26 # \"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\" \u2013 3:35 # \"Indian Pacific\" \u2013 3:02 # \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" \u2013 3:17 # \"Mama Tried\" \u2013 2:17 # \"Behind Closed Doors\" \u2013 2:56 # \"I Walk the Line\" \u2013 2:25 # \"Hey Good Lookin'\" \u2013 3:00 # \"Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine\" \u2013 4:13 # \"Oh Lonesome Me\" \u2013 3:09 # \"You're My Best Friend\" \u2013 3:24 # \"Seven Spanish Angels\" \u2013 3:17 # \"That's the Way Love Goes\" \u2013 3:10 # \"Medley\" (\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\"/\"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\"/\"On the Road Again\") \u2013 3:36 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013/14) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Albums Chart | 35 |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 2 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 6 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 44 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 45 |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- | Australia | 14 June 2013 | | Sony Music Australia | 88765434052 |- |} ==See also== * The Great Country Songbook Volume 2 ==References== Category:2013 albums Category:Adam Harvey albums Category:Troy Cassar-Daley albums Category:Covers albums Category:Collaborative albums Category:Sony Music Australia albums ",
