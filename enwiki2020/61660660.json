The site's critical consensus reads: \"With its heart on its sleeve and style to spare, Hollywood is anything but subtle \u2013 if only its good intentions were paired with a less convoluted story.\" On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the series two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying: \"It's a fascinating blend of fact (or least stories based on factual characters) and fiction, and the performances from the cast of rising stars and reliable veterans are dazzling \u2014 but like many a motion picture, Hollywood can't overcome script problems that surface about midway through the story.\" Conversely, Hugh Montgomery of the BBC described the series as \"spineless and inert\", giving it one out of five stars and saying \"A show about Tinseltown that chose to confront and prod at these continuing, dispiriting realities rather than concoct its own vapid, hubristic fantasies would be worth 10 times this one.\" Similarly, The Guardians Lucy Mangan criticized its \"counterfactual history\", giving the series a two out of five-star review, writing: \"This should be the perfect set-up for a scabrous look at prejudice, corruption, the trading of sexual currency, coercion, the well-oiled machinations that underlie an industry and how it all shapes history \u2014 all through a #MeToo lens. But it becomes a mere wish-fulfilment fantasy that, whether it intends to or not, suggests that if a few people had just been that bit braver, then movies \u2013 and therefore the world! \u2014 would be a glorious, egalitarian Eden. It is a show that is smug and obtuse enough to believe la la land's self-regarding idea that celluloid art directly shapes our lives.\" While FAULT Magazine praised the show for its beautiful work on costume design and career topping performances of Dylan McDermott, Jeremy Pope and Samara Weaving, they criticised the show's dangerous embellishment of systemic prejudice of post-war USA. \"The only ones who benefit from the erasure of Hollywood\u2019s brutal history of racism and homophobia, are those that perpetrated it.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:04%;\"| Year ! style=\"width:25%;\"| Association ! style=\"width:35%;\"| Category ! style=\"width:30%;\"| Nominated artist/work ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Ref |- | rowspan=\"12\"| 2020 | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"| Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie | Jeremy Pope | | align=\"center\" rowspan=12| |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie | Dylan McDermott (for \"Meg\") | |- | Jim Parsons (for \"Outlaws\") | |- | |Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie | Holland Taylor (for \"Jump\") | |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"8\"| Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards | Outstanding Period Costumes | Lou Eyrich, Sarah Evelyn, Tiger Curran and Suzy Freeman (for \"A Hollywood Ending\") | |- | Outstanding Period and/or Character Hairstyling | Michelle Ceglia, Barry Lee Moe, George Guzman, Michele Arvizo and Maria Elena Pantoja (for \"A Hollywood Ending\") | |- | Outstanding Period and/or Character Makeup (Non-Prosthetic) | Eryn Krueger Mekash, Kim Ayers, Kerrin Jackson and Ana Gabriela Qui\u00f1onez (for \"Outlaws\") | |- | Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Limited Series, Movie or Special | Vincent Van Dyke, Cary Ayers and Bruce Spaulding Fuller (for \"Jump\") | |- | Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie or Special (Original Dramatic Score) | Nathan Barr (for \"Hooray for Hollywood: Part 2\") | |- | Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music | Nathan Barr | |- | Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Period or Fantasy Program (One Hour or More) | Matthew Flood Ferguson, Mark Robert Taylor and Melissa Licht | |} ==References== ==External links== * * *Official trailer Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020 American television series endings Category:2020s American drama television miniseries Category:2020s American LGBT-related drama television series Category:American drama web series Category:American LGBT-related web series Category:Cultural depictions of actors Category:Cultural depictions of Cole Porter Category:Cultural depictions of Eleanor Roosevelt Category:Cultural depictions of film directors Category:Cultural depictions of Rock Hudson Category:English-language television shows Category:Gay-related television shows Category:English- language Netflix original programming Category:Race and ethnicity in television Category:Television series about show business Category:Television series created by Ryan Murphy (writer) Category:Television series set in the 1940s Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles Category:Television series set in 1948 ",
