    "text": "Jack Hermansson (born June 10, 1988) is a Swedish-Norwegian professional mixed martial artist, who competes in the Middleweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He is the former champion in Cage Warriors and Warrior Fight Series. In 2012-2013, he fought in the United States in the Bellator MMA promotion. On the European circuit, he held notable victories over UFC veteran Karlos Vemola and Bellator veteran Norman Paraisy among others. As of November 4, 2019, he is #4 in the UFC middleweight rankings. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Hermansson started his martial arts career as a Greco-Roman wrestler in 1997, at age of 9. He transitioned to mixed martial arts in 2008. He turned professional in 2010 and racked up a 5-0 record, all stoppages (4 KO\u2019s, 1 submission), in little over a year. In his first fight he won the title in the East Coast Fight Factory organisation by a one punch knockout in the third round. Two of the other victories, both by knockout, came in British top promotion Cage Warriors. ===Bellator MMA=== After his early career success, Hermansson was signed by American promotion Bellator MMA in 2012. Hermansson made his promotional debut against Daniel Vizcaya on December 14, 2012 at Bellator 84. He lost the back- and-forth fight by split decision. Hermansson next fought Jason Butcher on March 21, 2013 at Bellator 93. He lost the fight by submission due to a triangle choke. This would mark the last fight for Hermansson in the promotion. ===Independent promotions=== After two fights overseas, Hermansson returned to Europe and Cage Warriors. Hermansson's first outing came against Enoc Solves Torres on March 22, 2014 at Cage Warriors 66. He won the fight by TKO in the third round. Less than a month later Hermansson took on Ion Pascu on April 18, 2014 at Cage Warriors: Fight Night 11. He won by unanimous decision, the first decision victory of his career. Hermansson challenged for the promotional title against veteran and fellow former Bellator fighter Norman Paraisy on June 7, 2014 at Cage Warriors 69. He became the champion after he defeated Paraisy by submission due to a rear-naked choke at the end of round 4. Hermansson defended his title against Deyan Topalski on August 22, 2014 at Cage Warriors 71. He won the fight by TKO in the first round. In February 2015, the Cage Warriors promotion would become inactive after changing in the leading staff. When and if the organization would return to make new events were unclear. Hermansson himself would be out of action due to injuries for almost a year. Hermansson returned in a title fight in British promotion Warrior Fight Series against UFC veteran Karlos Vemola on August 1, 2015 at Warrior Fight Series 4. He won the fight by submission due to an armbar in the first round to become the WFS champion. Hermansson was scheduled to face K\u00e9vin Del on November 29, 2015 at Lion FC 6 for the promotional championship. However, Del would later withdraw from the contest citing an injury, and the bout was scrapped altogether. Next Hermansson instead fought undefeated polish fighter Maciej Rozanski on December 12, 2015 at Venator FC 2. Hermansson won the fight by unanimous decision. Hermansson was supposed to defend his WFS title on February 13, 2016 at Warrior Fight Series 5. No opponent was set and later it was announced by the promotion that the title defense would not materialize at that event. On February 11, 2016, after almost one and a half year of inactivity, Cage Warriors announced their return. Hermansson defended his CWFC title against Alan Carlos on the first event after the promotion's return on April 15, 2016 at Cage Warriors 75. He won the fight by knockout in the ending sequences of round three. Hermansson faced Ireneusz Cholewa on May 21, 2016 at Venator FC 3. Hermansson won the fight via TKO in round 3. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== ====2016==== On May 31, 2016 it was announced that Hermansson had signed with the UFC. He made his promotional debut against Scott Askham on September 3, 2016 at UFC Fight Night 93. He won the fight by unanimous decision. Hermansson next faced Cezar Ferreira on November 19, 2016 at UFC Fight Night 100. He lost the fight via submission in the second round. ====2017==== Next Hermansson faced Alex Nicholson on May 28, 2017 at UFC Fight Night 109.

Hermansson faced Gerald Meerschaert on December 15, 2018 at UFC on Fox 31. He won the fight by a guillotine choke submission in the first round. ====2019==== Hermansson next faced David Branch on March 30, 2019 at UFC on ESPN 2. He won the fight via submission due to a guillotine choke, 49 seconds into the first round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award. Hermansson had a quick turnaround as he replaced an injured Yoel Romero to face former Strikeforce middleweight champion Ronaldo Souza on April 27, 2019 in the main event at UFC Fight Night 150. He won the fight by unanimous decision. On July 17, it was reported that Hermansson signed a 6-fight deal with UFC. Hermansson faced Jared Cannonier on September 28, 2019 in the main event of UFC Fight Night 160. He lost the fight via TKO in the second round. ====2020==== Hermansson was expected to face Chris Weidman on May 2, 2020 at UFC Fight Night: Hermansson vs. Weidman. However, on April 9, Dana White, the president of UFC announced that the event was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. Instead he faced Kelvin Gastelum on July 19, 2020 at UFC Fight Night 172. Hermansson won the fight by submission due to a heel hook in the first round. Hermansson is scheduled to face Darren Till on December 5, 2020 at UFC Fight Night 185. ==Personal life== Hermansson moved from his native Sweden to Norway when he was 18 years old to find work. He settled in Oslo, where he also started training in MMA.
