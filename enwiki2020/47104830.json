The reviewer added that \"Anbazhagan has managed to link elements like friendship, deceit, love and greediness and entertain to a good extent\" and that \"Harish Uthaman as the cruel baddie and Chinni Jayanth, in a different avatar as a doting dad, score above others in the movie\", while \"though the songs are decent enough and hummable, they mar the narration at times\".http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie- reviews/rubaai/movie-review/59605330.cms The Deccan Chronicle wrote the film was \"well intended but not without flaws\", while The New Indian Express noted the film was not \"paisa vasool\".http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie- reviews/150717/rubaai-movie-review-well-intended-but-not-without- flaws.htmlhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/review/2017/jul/15/rubaai- movie-review-not-paisa-vasool-1628826.html ==References== ==External links== Category:2017 films Category:Indian action drama films Category:Indian films Category:Films scored by D.
