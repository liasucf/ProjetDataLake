He was expelled in December 1993 after the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, refused to visit the capital Khartoum during a tour of the country and spent much of his time in the rebel-held south. After talks hosted in London hosted by Douglas Hogg, relations were eventually restored in 1995 with the appointment of Alan Goulty. ==Honours== * 40px Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) - 1986 ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Members of HM Diplomatic Service Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Sudan Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George ",
