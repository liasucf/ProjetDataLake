    "text": "The Penington Institute is a public health research and drug policy organization based in Carlton, Victoria, Australia. The Institute produces an annual report on Australian overdose deaths. The 2018 report showed that deaths from overdoses, mostly from opioids, had increased across the country consistently since 2003, and significantly outnumbered deaths on the road. Figures are produced detailing deaths for individual areas. The Institute initiated International Overdose Awareness Day in 2015. ==References== Category:Drugs in Australia Category:Drug policy organizations Category:Medical and health organisations based in Victoria (Australia) ",
