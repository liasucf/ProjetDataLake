    "text": "There have been four baronetcies created for persons with the surname Morris, all in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. As of 2014 two of the creations are extant. The Morris Baronetcy, of Clasemont in the County of Glamorgan, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 12 May 1806 for the copper and coal magnate, John Morris. The 1st baronet had founded Morriston, the industrial suburb of Swansea, which was overlooked by the family seat at Clasemont. This residence was later knocked down and the stones were incorporated into a new family house at Sketty Park. Various lines died out, and the baronetcy eventually came to the 8th baronet, George Lockwood Morris, who succeeded at the age of 88, three months before his death. The 8th baronet had been a local industrialist and a Welsh international rugby player. The ninth baronet, the 8th baronet's son, was the painter and horticulturalist Cedric Morris.Richard Morphet Cedric Morris Tate gallery 1984 As of 28 February 2014 the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1982. The Morris Baronetcy, of Spiddal in the County of Galway, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 14 September 1885. For more information on this creation, see the Baron Killanin.
