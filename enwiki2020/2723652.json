    "text": "Tevarit Majchacheep Tevarit Majchacheep (; ) (born February 22, 1975) in Thailand, was the first 10 m Air Rifle shooter to raise a world record to the maximum level, hitting the 0.5-millimeter dot with 60 consecutive shots. He was fairly unknown to the shooting community (although he had finished fifth at an ISSF World Cup) when he accomplished this at the 2000 Asian Championships in Langkawi. Since then, he has been a regular finalist at world-level competitions, but has so far failed to win any of the large championships. Since Tevarit's 600, several women have reached the maximum 400 points of their shorter Air Rifle match, but he remained the sole holder of the men's world record until 2008. ==Olympic results== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Event !2000 !2004 |- |align=left|50 metre rifle three positions |37th 1144 |16th 1159 |- |align=left|50 metre rifle prone |51st 580 |36th 589 |- |align=left|10 metre air rifle |18th 588 |35th 587 |} ==Records== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" !colspan=9 | Current world records held in 10 m Air Rifle |- | Men |} == External links == * Tevarit's profile at ISSF NEWS Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Thai male sport shooters Category:ISSF rifle shooters Category:World record holders in shooting Category:Shooters at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Shooters at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic shooters of Thailand Category:Asian Games medalists in shooting Category:Shooters at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Shooters at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Shooters at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Shooters at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Shooters at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for Thailand Category:Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Thailand Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Southeast Asian Games gold medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Thailand Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in shooting Category:Competitors at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games ",
