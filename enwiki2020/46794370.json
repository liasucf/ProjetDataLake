He trained as a school teacher for Estonian and Sport. Antson worked from 1916 as a teacher and journalist. 1925-26 he worked as an editor at Virulane, 1927-1930 at Rahva S\u00f5na and 1931-1933 at Vaba Maa. Interested in political and social issues of the day, he was influenced by expressionism. With other like-minded intellectuals he formed a loose literary group under the name Aktsioon, with whom he published three literary almanacs (1926, 1927, 1929) with his friend Valter Kaaver. In the 1920s gained recognition as a political writer. His plays describe the horrors of war and the revolutionary struggle, and were among the popular stage works of the time. In the 1930s he turned to lighter subjects and authored two novels, and penned numerous satirical epigrams and travel stories. He was also active in the workers' sports movement. In the Estonian team, he participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris in the 1500 metres. During the first Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940-41 he was employed by the communist party newspaper Rahva H\u00e4\u00e4l (The People's Voice). Along with the likes of August Gailit, August Jakobson, Mait Metsanurk, and August M\u00e4lk, he expressed sympathy for Communism.
