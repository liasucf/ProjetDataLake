    "text": "', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. It is located at the foot of Mount Banahaw, and stands 1,000 feet above sea level. One hundred twenty kilometers south of Manila, it is bounded by the municipality of Magdalena on the north-west, by Lucban in Quezon province on the southeast, by Luisiana on the north-east, and by Liliw on the west. Majayjay has the Taytay Falls, also called the Majayjay Falls or Imelda Falls, because ex-First Lady Imelda Marcos financed the promotion of tourism in this place. It is a two-storey high falls located in a remote scenery where the forestry is abundant. To reach Taytay Falls, one has to go down the stone steps leading to a kilometer-long trail. Constructed in 2008, during the past, reaching Taytay Falls is a very hard task, as there were no marked trails during that time. Recently, the World Bank has sponsored the promotion of tourism in Taytay Falls. ==History and culture== It called Majayjay because it is a mountain place. And, the people is saying hay hay. And it become Majayjay Indigenous residents use to call it Malay Barangay. The Spanish colonial government made it a town in 1578. During this period, Malay Barangay was one of the most populated settlements in the newly founded province. It competed with Bay and Pagsanjan during the selection of the province\u2019s capital. The popularity of this new town grew instantly during the Spanish period. Its location at the foot of the mountain gave it an abundant supply of fresh mountain spring water. Four rivers flowed through the town. They were Initian, Oobi and Ula, from the towering mountain, and Balanac from the falls of Botocan where all the three rivers meet. Botocan Falls and the town\u2019s scenery were uniquely famous. Europeans and wealthy natives from Manila frequently visited the town. However, the road to Malay Barangay was tough. Guests have to be ferried from Manila through the Pasig River to Laguna de Bay. Land travel began by mounting on horses through a path in the forest, and then borne by natives in hammocks on the way up to Malay Barangay. As to how Malay Barangay got its name Majayjay, residents assume that Spaniards found it difficult to pronounce Malay Barangay. Early colonizers may have shortened it to Malay-ay, until it became Majayjay. Legends, however say that it was the difficult journey to Majayjay, which gave the town its name. Tired travelers sighed, \u201cHay!\u201d after scaling a cliff, \u201cHay!\u201d after ascending a hill, and \u201cHay!\u201d after crossing a raging river. Thus, guests referred to the place \u201cMahayhay,\u201d meaning, many sighs. Spaniards spelled it \u201cMajayjay.\u201d Immediately after the conversion of the natives of Malay Barangay, a makeshift church was built near May-it River. Fire destroyed it in 1578. Believers built a new church made of bamboo and cogon thatch to refurbish the former. However, fire again razed it to the ground. This time, the faithful built a stone church, but it again smoldered to ashes. The residents wondered. In spite of the repeated incidents of fire, the image of their Patron Saint, San Gregorio Papa Magno remained miraculously unscathed. Through the efforts of Padre Jos\u00e9 de Puertollano, contributions enforced from parishioners, and forced labor of the natives, a new elegant church rose in Majayjay. It took nineteen years, incalculable donations and countless lash marks that scarred the backs of languid natives to finish the church. The church\u2019s completion in 1730 put it in the list of the most elegant churches in the province. ==Geography== Majayjay is geographically a landlocked area situated in the southernmost part of the province of Laguna.
