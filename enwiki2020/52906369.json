    "text": "Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is defined as removed pavement materials containing asphalt and aggregates. These materials are generated when asphalt pavements are removed for reconstruction, resurfacing, or to obtain access to buried utilities. When properly crushed and screened, RAP consists of high- quality, well-graded aggregates coated by asphalt cement. Asphalt pavement has been America's most recycled material for a long time.A Study of the Use of Recycled Paving Material: Report to Congress, June 1993, Federal Highway Administration and United States Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC. FHWA-RD-93-147 and EPA/600/R-93/095. Using RAP material has well- recognized financial and environmental benefits.Al-Qadi, Imad L., Mostafa Elseifi, and Samuel H. Carpenter. \"Reclaimed asphalt pavement\u2014a literature review.\" FHWA-ICT-07-001 (2007). Although most of the produced RAP is recycled, a large portion of it is wasted or down-graded when used in landfills, embankment or base layers.H. Ali and M. Mohammadafzali (2017), \"Long-Term Aging of Asphalt Binders used with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement\", Florida Department of Transportation As of 2016, only few U.S. state agencies used more than 25% RAP (or recycled asphalt shingles or a combination of both) in their roadway asphalt mixtures. ==References== Category:Asphalt Category:Recycled building materials ",
