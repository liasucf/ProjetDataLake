'Falize: A Dynasty of Jewellers.' London: Thames & Hudson, 1999 He is known for his breathtaking and innovative designs for both public and private sales. == Early years == Lucien was a serious and diligent child who planned to attend the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures before his father, Alexis, announced he was to become a future partner in his relatively young firm, Falize. In 1856, Lucien began an apprenticeship with his father, where he quickly learnt enough to supervise the design and manufacture of the pieces created in the workshop. His studies continued quickly, as Lucien found his passion, and in 1869 at the exhibition held by the Union Centrale des Beaux Arts appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Industrie, he was awarded a first class medal as a coop\u00e9rateur. Two years later, at the age of 32, he was made a full partner and took over the firm in 1876. == Marriage and children == The same year he was made a partner, Lucien married Louise Cl\u00e9mentine Poulard (1850-1914), with whom he had three sons: Andr\u00e9 Alexis Eug\u00e8ne (1872-1936), Jean Henri Lucien (1874-1948), and Pierre Isidore (1875-1953). Although there is little evidence of tenderness and passion between Lucien and Cl\u00e9mentine \u2013 it is thought his parents instigated the match \u2013 he was a devoted father, designing and making individual silver watches for each of his children's first communion. == Artistic career == Gothic Revival Angelus Carriage Clock Falize's makers mark, circa 1878-1880 Lucien Falize was heavily influenced by his visits to London in 1861 and 1862, where he went to the National Gallery, Westminster Abbey, and the Crystal Palace. He was struck by the Chinese, Indian, Assyrian, and Egyptian exhibits, and at the International Exhibition he was impressed by the Oriental lacquers, enamels, bronzes, prints, and earthenware taken from the collection of Sir Rutherford Alcock. Due to his ties to the firm, Falize was unable to travel to Japan, but his passion for the East began to manifest through his designs. Pendants, bracelets, necklaces, and brooches with a distinct Oriental effect began to emerge. These were enamelled and filled with bold, opaque colours with delicate scenes of nature and animals. Lucien also visited the Campana collection at the Louvre, where he viewed a number of items, being influenced by the treasure trove of medieval, Renaissance, Assyrian, Egyptian, and Byzantine objects. Until his death by a stroke in 1897, Lucien continued to create breathtaking designs for public sale and private commissions. He was determined to make the jewellery house Falize a commercial success, collaborating with other established designers like Germain Bapst, with whom he was partnered from 1880 to 1892. He was a prolific writer and reviewer and often published under his pseudonym, \u2018Monsieur Josse\u2019 in the decorative arts journals of the day. Lucien Falize was also deeply involved in the Union Centrale throughout his career. He firmly believed in the importance of providing proper training to future designers, and he submitted plans for technical exhibitions and donated working prototypes of chatelaines and electrotypes of bracelets. Lucien also entered his firm into a number of competitions and Expositions Universelles and was awarded countless honours and honorary positions throughout his career. Often frustrated by the need to be a commercial success as well as a critical one, Lucien said in a letter to his son Andr\u00e9 in April 1896 \u201ca big firm cannot survive on works of art alone.\u201d His friend, jeweller and collector Henri Vever, said about Lucien: > How he would have loved to have lived\u2026at the time of the Medici, freed from > heavy commercial burdens and only preoccupied by the creation of beautiful > works. == Exhibitions and awards == 1869: Union Centrale des Beaux arts appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Industrie ::Awarded a first class medal as a coop\u00e9rateur 1876: Union Centrale des Beaux arts appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Industrie ::As he was a jury member and official reporter, Lucien was excluded from the awards 1877: Amsterdam Exhibition ::Represented France with Alfred Darcel 1878: Exposition Universelle, Paris ::Awarded a Grand Prix; granted a Legion d\u2019Honneur 1880: \u2018Les Arts du M\u00e9tal\u2019 at the Union Centrale Gothic revival table clock with calendar, 1881, displayed at the 1889 Exposition Universelle 1889: Exposition Universelle, Paris ::Official reporter on the goldsmith\u2019s section, and was therefore unable to be awarded any prizes. ::Received public recognition by being decorated Officer de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur 1896: Salon des Champs-Elys\u00e9es :: Lucien\u2019s gold enamelled \u2018hanap\u2019 (lidded goblet) hailed as a technical masterpiece == Commissions == *Alfred Morrison (1821 \u2013 1897): second son of James Morrison (founder of firm Morrison, Dillon & Co which was to become the Fore Street Limited Liability Company) *Gaston de Galard de B\u00e9arn, Prince de Viana (1840 \u2013 1893): one of Lucien's most eminent patrons *The Pereire brothers: Emile and Isaac, prominent property developers and financiers *La Marquise Arconati-Visconti (1840 \u2013 1923): daughter of Alphonse Peyrat *Eduord Corroyer (1837 \u2013 1904): architect and pupil of Viollet-le-Duc *Princess Loetitia Bonaparte: great-niece of Napoleon I *Tsar Nicholas II (1868 \u2013 1918) and his wife, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (1872 \u2013 1918) *Queen Marie (1875 \u2013 1938) and King Ferdinand I (1865 \u2013 1927) of Romania *Prince Alfred (1844 \u2013 1900), Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha: son of Queen Victoria *Several sporting clubs in France enlisted Falize in creating sculptures, barometers, and clocks: The Jockey Club, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Yacht-Club, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Steeple- Chases == Gallery == File:Persian bracelet falize.jpg| File:Falize jewellery box.jpg| File:Gruel and Engelmann - Binding for a Book of Hours - Walters 572167 - Front Closed.jpg| File:Bottle for smelling salts Rijksmuseum Amsterdam BK-2009-50.jpg| File:Carriage Clock LACMA M.2001.137.jpg| ==References== __INDEX__ Category:French jewellers Category:19th-century French people Category:1839 births Category:1897 deaths Category:19th-century men ",
