    "text": "Gypsy: A Musical Fable is a 1959 musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents. Gypsy is loosely based on the 1957 memoirs of striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose name has become synonymous with \"the ultimate show business mother.\" It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress June Havoc. The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including \"Everything's Coming up Roses\", \"Together (Wherever We Go)\", \"Small World\", \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\", \"Let Me Entertain You\", \"All I Need Is the Girl\", and \"Rose's Turn\". It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-twentieth century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the book musical. Gypsy has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them Ben Brantley (\"what may be the greatest of all American musicals...\")Brantley, Ben. \"New Momma Takes Charge\" The New York Times, May 2, 2003 and Frank Rich.Rich, Frank (November 17, 1989 The Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980\u20131993. Random House. 1998. . Rich wrote that \"Gypsy is nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to King Lear.\"Rich, Frank (November 17, 1989) \"Review/Theater; 'Gypsy' Is Back on Broadway With a Vengeance\", The New York Times Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that \"Gypsy is one of the best of musicals...\" and described Rose as \"one of the few truly complex characters in the American musical.\"Barnes, Clive (September 24, 1974) Gypsy' Bounces Back With Zest and Lilt\" The New York Times ==Background== A musical based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee was a project of producer David Merrick and actress Ethel Merman. Merrick had read a chapter of Lee's memoirs in Harper's Magazine and approached Lee to obtain the rights. Jerome Robbins was interested, and wanted Leland Hayward as co-producer; Merman also wanted Hayward to produce her next show.Millstein, Gilbert (May 17, 1959) \"Culled From a Stripper's Past\", The New York Times, p. X1 Merrick and Hayward approached Arthur Laurents to write the book. As he relates, Laurents initially was not interested until he saw that the story was one of parents living their children's lives. Composers Irving Berlin and Cole Porter declined the project. Finally, Robbins asked Stephen Sondheim, who agreed to do it. Sondheim had worked with Robbins and Laurents on the musical West Side Story. However, Merman did not want an unknown composer, and wanted Jule Styne to write the music. Although Sondheim initially refused to write only the lyrics, he was persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to accept the job.Zadan, Craig (1986) Sondheim & Co., Second Edition, pp.37-39, pp.50-51, ==Synopsis== ===Act I=== Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother, is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. The kiddie act has one song, \"May We Entertain You\", that they sing over and over again, with June always as the centerpiece and Louise often as one of the \"boys\" (\"Baby June and Her Newsboys\"). Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks, such as attempting to borrow money from her father (\"Some People\"). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles (\"Small World\"). The girls grow up, and June, now billed as Dainty June, and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit (\"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\"). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and asks her birthday present, a lamb, just how old she is this year (\"Little Lamb\"). After Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal, he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her (\"You'll Never Get Away From Me\"). Now billed as \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\", the act finally performs on the Orpheum Circuit (\"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\", \u201cBroadway\u201d). June is soon offered a place at a Performing Arts school after an audition. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business (\"If Momma Was Married\"). A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides in Louise that he has been working on his own act (\"All I Need Is the Girl\"), and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together. Shortly after, June is missing, and in a note, she explains that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, and they will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but then optimistically vows that she will make Louise a star, proclaiming that \"Everything's Coming up Roses\". ===Act II=== Louise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell \"Madame Rose's Toreadorables\" to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together (\"Together, Wherever We Go\"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a \"gimmick,\" something that \"makes your strip special\" (\"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Louise is sad at what she's being pushed to do for her mother's love and Herbie is disgusted at how low Rose has stooped and he finally walks out on her (\"Small World\" (Reprise)). Although reluctant, Louise goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, \"May We Entertain You?\". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her \"gimmick\" (\"Let Me Entertain You\" \"(Gypsy Strip Tease)\"). Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to \"Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!\" The song becomes brasher and brassier, and more and more articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated \"Gypsy Rose Lee\", have a bitter argument. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, reveals that the true motivation for all her actions has been to live vicariously through her daughters, to chase the stardom she wanted for herself, not her children (\"Rose's Turn\"). She realizes that she has driven away June, Herbie, and now possibly Louise. She displays the talent that could have been under different circumstances, as the name \"Rose\" flashes in neon lights. After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively move toward reconciliation in the end. *In the 1974 and 2008 Broadway revivals, although the final dialogue scene remains, there is not a happy ending, but rather a bleak, sad one as all hopes of reconciliation for Rose and Louise fall flat when Louise walks away, laughing sarcastically at Rose's new \"dream.\" The audience is then left with a Rose whose dream of her own lit up marquee slowly fades away to her unrealistic dreams. *In the 2003 revival starring Bernadette Peters, the final dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise walks through the stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on her face as she takes one last look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door. *In the 2015 West End revival starring Imelda Staunton, Louise begins to walk out, and Rose catches up after waking up to reality. Louise puts her arm around Rose as they exit together, giving the appearance that Louise is now taking care of Rose. ==Songs== ===Act I=== * \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra * \"May We Entertain You?\" \u2013 Baby June and Baby Louise * \"Some People\" \u2013 Rose * \"Some People\" (Reprise) \u2013 Rose * \"Small World\" \u2013 Rose and Herbie * \"Baby June and Her Newsboys\" \u2013 Baby June and Newsboys * \"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\" \u2013 Rose, Herbie, Ensemble * \"Little Lamb\" \u2013 Louise * \"You'll Never Get Away From Me\" \u2013 Rose and Herbie * \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\" \u2013 June and Farmboys * \"Broadway\" \u2013 June and Farmboys * \"If Momma Was Married\" \u2013 June and Louise * \"All I Need Is the Girl\" \u2013 Tulsa * \"Everything's Coming up Roses\" \u2013 Rose ===Act II=== * \"Entr'acte\" - Orchestra * \"Madame Rose's Toreadorables\" \u2013 Louise, Rose and the Hollywood Blondes * \"Together, Wherever We Go\" - Rose, Herbie, and Louise * \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\" \u2013 Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura * \"Small World\" (Reprise) \u2013 Rose * \"Let Me Entertain You\" \u2013 Louise * \"Rose's Turn\" \u2013 Rose * \"Finale\" \u2013 Orchestra ===Notes on songs=== During the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called \"Nice She Ain't\" (cut because it was given to Jack Klugman one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time), and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\". The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\" was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959.\"Petula Clark discography\" . PetulaClark.net Other cut songs include \"Mother's Day\", a song for Baby June's act, \"Smile, Girls\", which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile in order to make the act look good, \"Who Needs Him?\", which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and \"Three Wishes for Christmas\", a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at Minsky's Burlesque.Sondheim, Stephen, Finishing the Hat, New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010 p. 58-77 ==Dramatic analysis== In analyzing the character of Rose, Clive Barnes described her as \"bossy, demanding, horrific\". Rich described Rose as \"a monster\". Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood.Kerr, Walter. \"Two Musicals We Need Have Checked In\". The New York Times. December 17, 1989. p. H7 Patti LuPone describes Rose: \"She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids.... And she is a survivor. I do not see her as a monster at all\u2014she may do monstrous things, but that does not make a monster.\"Lunden, Jeff. \"Stage Mother from Hell: Needy, Greedy Mama Rose\". NPR.org. April 13, 2008. Sondheim has said of the character: \"The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force.\"Rich, Frank. \"Theatre \u2013 'Gypsy': Then, Now and Always\". The New York Times. May 4, 2003. p.AR1 (Retrieved May 6, 2008) Sondheim also noted, \"Yet the end of Gypsy is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother. There is hope for her. Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.' There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness.\" Brantley noted that Rose is a \"mythic character\". She is \"[t]raditionally presented as an armored tank on autopilot, which finally crashes only minutes before the final curtain\". Bernadette Peters' take on the character was different: \"Rose was a woman who was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in 'Rose's Turn', she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her...and that destroys Rose. There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother.\"\"From the Archives: Bernadette Peters Joined the Sisterhood of Roses With the 2003 Gypsy Revival\" Playbill, May 23, 2019 ==Productions== ===Original production=== The original Broadway production opened on May 21, 1959 at The Broadway Theatre, transferred to the Imperial Theatre, and closed on March 25, 1961 after 702 performances and two previews. The show was produced by David Merrick and directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. Ethel Merman starred as Rose, with Jack Klugman as Herbie and Sandra Church as Louise. Scenic and Lighting design were by Jo Mielziner and costumes were by Raoul P\u00e8ne Du Bois. The orchestrations, including an overture,Kantor, Michael and Laurence Maslon, Broadway: The American Musical, Bulfinch Press, New York, p. 286. were supplied by Sid Ramin and Robert Ginzler. Critic Frank Rich has referred to Robbins' work as one of the most influential stagings of a musical in American theatrical history. The original production received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actress in a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design and Best Direction of a Musical, but failed to win any. When the show closed in March 1961, two national touring companies toured the US. The first company starred Merman and opened in March 1961 at the Rochester, New York Auditorium, and closed in December 1961 at the American, St. Louis, Missouri. The second national company starred Mitzi Green as Rose, followed by Mary McCarty. A young Bernadette Peters appeared in the ensemble and understudied Dainty June, a role she would play the following year in summer stock, opposite Betty Hutton's Rose. It opened in September 1961 at the Shubert Theatre, Detroit and closed in January 1962 at the Hanna, Cleveland, Ohio. ===1973 London production=== In 1973, it was announced that Elaine Stritch would be starring in the first West End production of the show. However, when ticket sales proved to be unsuccessful, producers hired the more familiar Angela Lansbury (according to Craig Zadan, \"The ...producers were not able to raise the required capital on Stritch's name, and the promise of a new production...became ominously distant\").Zadan, Craig. Sondheim & Co. (1974, 1986 2nd Ed.), Harper & Row, , p. 54 The West End production opened at the Piccadilly Theatre on May 29, 1973. It was produced by Barry M. Brown and Fritz Holt, in association with Edgar Lansbury (Angela's brother) and directed by the show's author, Arthur Laurents, with choreography reproduced by Robert Tucker. The supporting cast featured Zan Charisse, Barrie Ingham, Debbie Bowen and Bonnie Langford. Lansbury left the London production in December 1973 to tour the show in the US and was succeeded by Dolores Gray. The production closed on March 2, 1974, after 300 performances. ===1974 Broadway revival=== Prior to opening on Broadway, the Lansbury West End production had a 24-week tour of North America, starting in Toronto, and then travelling to many cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston.Berkvist, Robert. \"The Stages Are Being Set--on Broadway and Around the Land\". The New York Times, p. 115, September 8, 1974 The production opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 23, 1974 for a planned limited engagement, and closed on January 4, 1975 after 120 performances and four previews.\"'Gypsy', 1974 Broadway Revival\". sondheimguide.com, accessed July 30, 2012 The cast remained mainly the same on Broadway, except that Rex Robbins played Herbie, Maureen Moore (later Bernadette Peters' understudy as Rose in the 2003 revival) played the adult June, and Mary Louise Wilson was Tessie Tura. Angela Lansbury won the 1975 Tony Award. ===1989 Broadway revival=== A second revival had pre-Broadway engagements starting at the Jackie Gleason Theater of the Performing Arts, Miami Beach, Florida, in May 1989,Smith, Peter. \"Daly Brings Complexity To Role In 'Gypsy' \", Palm Beach Post (Florida). p.9D.

Laurents returned as director, with Tyne Daly as Rose, Jonathan Hadary as Herbie and Crista Moore as Louise.

This production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and Daly won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance. Jule Styne, in a 1989 interview in connection with the California tryout, said: \"About six months ago, Bette Midler wanted to buy it (Gypsy) for a movie. We wouldn't sell it. Because they'd only destroy it.\" USA Today reported that \"Both Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters say they would love to play it, but they weren't even approached for this production.\" ===2003 Broadway revival=== A new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003 and opened on May 1, 2003 at the Shubert Theatre. The director was Sam Mendes, with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward. Bernadette Peters played the role of Rose. The New York Times described Peters as \"a surefire box office draw who nonetheless may surprise some Gypsy aficionados...How will the ladylike Ms. Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...'One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,' Mr. Mendes said. 'She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.'\"McKinley, Jesse. \"On Stage and Off\". The New York Times. February 8, 2002. Laurents had talked to Mendes (\"Roughly five years ago\" according to The New York Times in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said \"he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose\".McKinley, Jesse. \"New 'Gypsy' Struts, Silencing Naysayers\". The New York Times. May 5, 2003. Section E, p.1 Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book Mainly on Directing 'Gypsy', 'West Side Story' and Other Musicals. In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters' portrayal of Rose was \"brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others\" while criticizing Mendes for the \"physical production\" which Laurents said \"was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized.\"Bryer, Jackson R.; Davison, Richard Allan. The art of the American musical: conversations with the creators (2005) Rutgers \u2013 the State University (NYC), , p.138 Gypsy had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set.Kissel, Howard. \"No 'Gypsy' In Her Soul\". New York Daily News. May 2, 2003. The cast featured John Dossett as Herbie, Tammy Blanchard as Louise, Kate Reinders as June and David Burtka as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical. In his review, Ben Brantley in The New York Times wrote that \"the surprise coup of many a Broadway season...Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career...There have been many illustrious successors to Merman as Rose...Only Ms. Peters, however, can be said to have broken the Merman mold completely.\"Brantley, Ben. \"New Momma Takes Charge\". The New York Times. May 2, 2003. Gypsy twice set new box office records for the Shubert Theatre. Its gross of $853,476 for the week of June 9\u201314, 2003 was the highest ever gross for a non-holiday week and the subsequent June 15\u201321, 2003 box office gross of $874,397 represented the highest gross for a show in Shubert history.Gans, Andrew. \"Momma's Goin' Strong: Gypsy Breaks All-Time Shubert Box-Office Record\" . Playbill.com. June 23, 2003. However, The New York Times announced that Gypsy would close on February 28, 2004, stating: \"Gypsy sold well for most of 2003. But by early January [2004], with tourists gone and local theatergoers staying inside during a brutal stretch of weather, the production's sales grew increasingly weak. More important, the show's advance sale, the main indicator of a production's staying power, began to shrink rapidly. It stood at less than $2 million yesterday.\"McKinley, Jesse. \"'Gypsy' to Close Feb. 28, At a Loss of Millions\". The New York Times. February 3, 2004. After an increase in the gross, the show's closing was postponed indefinitely, but Gypsy finally closed on May 30, 2004 after 451 performances and 33 previews.\"Final Curtain to Fall on 'Gypsy' May 30\". The New York Times. April 22, 2004. The production is believed to have recouped a little more than half of its $8 million investment. ===2008 Broadway revival=== Patti LuPone first portrayed Rose in Gypsy at the Chicago Ravinia Festival in August 2006, directed by Lonny Price and accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Gans, Andrew. Patti's Turn: LuPone Is Mama Rose in Ravinia's Gypsy Beginning Aug. 11\" . Playbill.com. August 11, 2006.

LuPone in \u2018Gypsy\u2019: \"Light the Lights, Boys! Mama Rose Hears a Symphony.\" New York Times, August 15, 2006 Excitement was generated around LuPone playing the role of Rose and producers were eager to see Price's production, with the hope of moving it to New York. Jack Viertel, the artistic director of New York City Center Encores! saw the production and was so impressed that he contacted Arthur Laurents, requesting that he direct a new fully staged production of the show for a new summer \"Encores!\" program.Laurents, Arthur. 'Gypsy' Mainly on Directing, Random House Digital, Inc., 2009, , p. 45 From July 9 to 29, 2007, the show was presented at New York City Center with LuPone once again. Directed by Arthur Laurents, the production also featured Laura Benanti as Louise, Boyd Gaines as Herbie and Leigh Ann Larkin as June. Nancy Opel, Marilyn Caskey, and Alison Fraser played the strippers Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura (Lenora Nemetz assumed the role of Mazeppa / Miss Cratchitt for the Broadway transfer.) LuPone recounted in her memoirs that, when Laurents began directing this production, he based his direction initially on the 1989 revival, \"because, I think that in Arthur's mind, the Tyne Daly Gypsy had been the last successful production.\" However, the cast \"questioned Arthur relentlessly about...the scenes\", and he \"tossed the old prompt book out and freed\" the actors to explore.LuPone, Patti. \"'Gypsy'\" Patti LuPone: A Memoir, Random House, Inc., 2010, , p. 288 The Encores! production was a success, and despite Ben Brantley's somewhat negative review of LuPone's performance in The New York Times, the show transferred to Broadway, where it opened at the St. James Theatre on March 27, 2008. Brantley gave the production a rave review, praising LuPone, Laurents and the rest of the cast, and describing the characterizations in the production: > \"You see, everyone's starved for attention in Gypsy. That craving, after > all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along. And Mr. Laurents makes > sure that we sense that hunger in everyone.... I was so caught up in the > emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), > that I didn't really think about the songs as songs.... There is no > separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those > uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons > to be.\"Brantley, Ben. \"Curtain Up! It\u2019s Patti\u2019s Turn\". New York Times. March > 28, 2008. This production won numerous awards including the Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards for LuPone, Gaines and Benanti. The show was originally scheduled to close in March 2009 on LuPone's final performance, but closed on January 11, 2009 due to decreases in ticket sales.Gans, Andrew. \"LuPone Gypsy Will Now Close in January 2009\" . Playbill.com. December 14, 2008. Like the 2003 production, this revival also closed at a loss. The production played for 332 performances and 27 previews. On the eve before the final curtain call, LuPone made news when she stopped the show during the song \"Rose's Turn\", to scold a patron for taking illegal photographs during the performance. Patti LuPone performed in Gypsy before Broadway, stating she starred as Louise in a high- school production of the show when she was 13 years old. LuPone had voiced interest in heading the 2003 Broadway revival, but Arthur Laurents reportedly banned her from any future work with his involvement because she previously walked out on a production of Jolson Sings Again, written by Laurents, in 1995. LuPone and Laurents subsequently reconciled.Green, Jesse. \"Let Her Entertain You. Please!\". The New York Times.
