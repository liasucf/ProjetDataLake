    "text": "Derry is a fictional town that has served as the setting for a number of Stephen King's novels, novellas, and short stories. Derry first appeared in King's 1981 short story \"The Bird and the Album\" and has reappeared as recently as his 2011 novel 11/22/63. Derry is said to be near Bangor, but King explicitly told his biographer, Tony Magistrale, that Derry is actually his portrayal of Bangor. A map on King's official website, though, places Derry in the vicinity of the town of Etna.Stephen King's Map of Maine. Retrieved 26 November 2016. King, a native of Durham, Maine, created a trinity of fictional Maine towns \u2014 Derry, Castle Rock and Jerusalem's Lot \u2014 as central settings in more than one work. == Overview == The town of Derry was first mentioned in Stephen King's 1981 short story \"The Bird and the Album\". While the town would be mentioned in various other stories, it wasn't until King's 1986 novel It when the town was used as a fully rendered setting. Besides the oft-used trinity of Derry, Castle Rock, and Jerusalem's Lot, King has created other fictional Maine towns, including Chamberlain in Carrie, Haven in The Tommyknockers, Little Tall Island in Dolores Claiborne and Storm of the Century, and Chester's Mill in Under the Dome. In 2016, it was announced that a new adaptation of It would split the novel into a two-part motion picture. During production, the producers of the 2017 film adaptation and its sequel, It Chapter 2, needed a small town in which to film, and Port Hope, Ontario was used for much of the exterior work for both movies.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/locations, It (2017) Filming & Production Some scenes said to be in Derry were shot elsewhere.https://globalnews.ca/news/5857602/port-hope-stephen-king-it- chapter-two/, Small-town Ontario community featured in \u2018It: Chapter Two\u2019 The synagogue appearing in It Chapter 2 was actually the Congregation Knesseth Israel in Toronto, while the Derry High school exteriors were filmed at the Mount Mary Retreat Centre in Ancaster, Ontario. Other Chapter 2 filming locations included the Scottish Rite Club in Hamilton, Ontario, Audley Park in Ajax, Ontario and Rouge Park in Scarborough, Toronto (as The Barrens).https://www.mpa-canada.org/press/warner-bros-entertainments-it- chapter-two-scares-up-a-hair-raising-56-4-million-for-ontarios-economy/, Warner Bros.

It is here where Eddie Kaspbrak first encounters It, which shows itself as a mix between a homeless leper and its familiar Pennywise form. Later, after Eddie tells them his story, Bill and Richie go to investigate the house and are chased off by It, the creature having taken the form of a werewolf. Soon after these incidents, the Losers Club goes back to the house in hopes of confronting It. However, soon after they confront It, the creature disappears into the sewers through a toilet pipe. They, therefore, decide to enter the sewers for their first showdown with It. During It's 1985 killing spree, the body of one of the creature's victims is found directly across the street from the house. In the 2017 adaptation and its sequel, 29 Neibolt Street acts as the primary entrance to It's lair and the scene of the Losers Club's first real confrontation with It. The house is built on the location of Derry's old well house where 91 settlers disappeared when Derry was first settled, as well as a central hub for the town's sewer system. At the end of the second movie, the house collapses along with It's lair when the Losers Club kills It. === The Barrens === The Barrens is a small tract of land still heavily covered in trees and plant life. Derry's landfill is located here, as is a gravel pit and several sewer pump stations. The Barrens play the most prominent role in It, as the Losers adopt them as their home away from home, even building an underground clubhouse there. Most of the Losers have their first meeting here while trying to build a small dam in the Kenduskeag Stream, which runs through the Barrens, and next to Derry. In It Chapter Two, after being thrown into a well, Henry Bowers is washed out of the sewer system into the Barrens by a flash flood. === The Canal === A section of the Kenduskeag that runs through downtown Derry. The Canal goes through a tunnel under the streets for a short way and comes out in Bassey Park. In January 1958, a young Ben Hanscom first encounters It walking on top of the frozen surface. A few months later, Eddie Corcoran is attacked here by It in the form of the Gill- man. === Derry Civic Center === The Derry Civic Center is a recent structure built after the old civic center was destroyed in the 1985 flood. It was designed by famed architect (and one-time Derry resident) Ben Hanscom. It plays an important role in the events of the novel Insomnia. The Crimson King, the supervillain of King's Dark Tower series, planned to use Ed Deepneau to fly into the Civic Center on a kamikaze mission, using a small plane armed with C4 explosives. The aim of this mission was not to kill the people inside the Center but to kill a child named Patrick Danville, who plays a key role in the Dark Tower story. Following an encounter with the Crimson King himself, Ralph Roberts and Lois Chasse force Deepneau to crash the plane in the Center's parking lot. Several people are killed, but Danville is ultimately saved. === Kitchener Ironworks === The Kitchener Ironworks was an ironworks outside of Derry. In 1906, despite every machine in the works having been shut completely down, the Ironworks inexplicably exploded, killing a group of 88 children and 102 total people who were participating in an Easter egg hunt. The tragedy was caused by It sabotaging the equipment, presumed to be responsible for eight missing bodies. This marked the beginning of the creature's 27-year hibernation period. It is at the ruins of the Kitchener Ironworks where a young Mike Hanlon first encounters It in the form of a giant bird in 1958. In the 2017 adaptation, Ben Hanscom first encounters It in the form of a headless child that was among the victims of the Kitchener Ironworks incident. === The Standpipe === The Standpipe was a large water tower in Derry, very similar to the Thomas Hill Standpipe. In its earlier days, it remained unlocked so that patrons of an adjoining park could climb a spiral staircase around the tank to look out over Derry from the top. The Standpipe was closed to the public after several children drowned in the tank, most likely the fault of It. The Standpipe is where Stan Uris first encounters It, which takes the form of drowned children. After the grown-up Losers Club kills It in the second Ritual Of Ch\u00fcd in 1985, a huge storm ensues, destroying many buildings and landmarks in Derry, including the Standpipe. In Dreamcatcher, Mr. Gray drives to Derry to find the Standpipe, only to discover a memorial featuring a cast-bronze statue of two children and a plaque underneath, dedicated to the victims of the 1985 flood and of It. The plaque has been vandalized with graffiti reading \"PENNYWISE LIVES\". In 11/22/63, Jake Epping buys a pillow with a picture of the Standpipe on it. He hides a gun in it, the gun he uses to kill Frank Dunning. === Tracker Brothers Shipping === According to It, the Tracker Brothers were two men who owned a trucking depot on Kansas Street during Its 1958 killing spree. The brothers maintained a baseball field behind the depot for children to play on. In Dreamcatcher, Jonesy, the Beav, Henry, and Pete first meet Duddits in the depot's parking lot in 1978 (at which time the depot has closed), saving him from a gang of bullies. In 1985, while visiting the abandoned depot, Eddie Kaspbrak encounters Pennywise for the first time since his childhood. The depot was destroyed in the same 1985 storm that destroyed the Standpipe. === Voigt Field === In The Running Man, a Richard Bachman novella set in a dystopian future, Derry is home to a large airport consisting of acres of parking lots, a huge \"Northern States Terminal\", several runways with the capacity to support large widebody aircraft, and a large fuel tank farm. Ben Richards, the novella's protagonist, arrives here by car and is allowed to board a \"Lockheed GA/Superbird\" by bluffing that he has enough plastic explosive with him to blow up the entire complex. == Literary works set in Derry == *It (1986) *Insomnia (1994) *Bag of Bones (1998) (partial) *\"The Road Virus Heads North\" (1999) (partial) (short story from Everything's Eventual) *Dreamcatcher (2001) *\"Fair Extension\" (2010) *11/22/63 (partially) (2011) == Works that reference Derry == *The Running Man (1982) *\"The Body\" (1982) (novella from Different Seasons) *Pet Sematary (1983) *\"Uncle Otto's Truck\" (1983) (short story from Skeleton Crew) *\"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut\" (1984) (short story from Skeleton Crew) *The Tommyknockers (1987) *Misery (1987) *\"The Night Flier\" (1988) *\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" (1990) (novella from Four Past Midnight) *Needful Things (1991) *Gerald's Game (1992) *\"Autopsy Room Four\" (1997) *Hearts in Atlantis (1999) *Storm of the Century (1999) *The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower (2004) *Lisey's Story (2006) *\"Mute\" (2007) *Under the Dome (2009) *Full Dark, No Stars (2010) *11/22/63 (2011) *It (2017) *Pet Sematary (2019) *It Chapter Two (2019) == In other media == In the 1993 novel One on One, author Tabitha King, who is King's wife, refers to Derry. In an afterword, she thanks \"another novelist who was kind enough to allow me\" to use the town's name. In the 2010 television series Haven, loosely adapted from King's novel The Colorado Kid, the town of Derry is mentioned. In the 2010 novel Horns, author Joe Hill, who is King's oldest son, writes of the real city of Derry, New Hampshire. In his 2013 novel NOS4A2, Hill includes the fictional Derry, Maine on a map and a list of supernatural places. In the crime drama Criminal Minds, the 10th season episode \"Mr. Scratch\" cites Derry as the location of a murder induced by hallucination. The victim of the murder was named \"Tabitha\", after King's wife. The 2019 film adaptation of Pet Sematary shows a road sign referring to Derry as 20 miles away in one scene. == See also == * Derry, Castlerock and Bangor in Northern Ireland == References == Category:Fictional populated places in Maine Category:Fictional populated places created by Stephen King Category:Culture of Bangor, Maine Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1981 ",
