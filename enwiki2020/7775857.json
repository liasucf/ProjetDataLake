Its two side spans are each, and there are also four small cable spans. The bridge received the 2010 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement award (OCEA) from the American Society of Civil Engineers.Bridging a Great Divide - The Sutong Yangtze River Bridge holds the record for the World\u2019s Longest Cable-Stayed Bridge Wins Prestigious U.S. Civil Engineering Award , American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA, March 25, 2010. Two towers of the bridge are high and thus the fifth tallest in the world. The total bridge length is . Construction began in June 2003, and the bridge was linked up in June 2007.

The completion of the bridge shortens the commute between Shanghai and Nantong, previously a four-hour ferry ride, to about an hour. It brings Nantong one step closer to becoming an important part of the Yangtze River Delta economic zone, and has further attracted foreign investors into the city. The bridge is also pivotal in the development of poorer northern Jiangsu regions. The tower is an inverted Y-shaped reinforced concrete structure with one connecting girder between tower legs. The bridge deck is a steel box girder with internal transverse and longitudinal diaphragms and fairing noses at both sides of the bridge deck. The total width of the bridge deck is 41 metres including the fairing noses. The construction of Zhaodian-Huangdu Section of Nantong-Shanghai Railway was commenced in March 2014. Following the completion of subgrade, bridges, mainline track-laying, and \u201ccommunication, signal, power and electrification\u201d works, the integrated commissioning & test began on 20 April 2020 ==Gallery== Image:Sutong Bridge-2.jpg|Sutong Yangtze River Bridge Image:On the Sutong Bridge 2.jpg|Road surface on the bridge.
