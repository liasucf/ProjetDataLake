    "text": "The Battle of Spilia is the name given in Greek Cypriot sources to a minor engagement of the Cyprus Emergency that took place in the neighbourhood of the Cypriot village of Spilia on either 11 or 12 December 1955. The engagement involved approximately 12 members of Georgios Grivas\u2019s EOKA group and a 40 man detachment of the 45 Commando Royal Marines. In British military sources this is known as part of a wider operation known as \u2018Foxhunter\u2019 that was tasked with breaking up the EOKA presence in the Troodos mountains and capturing EOKA leader Georgios Grivas.French, D. Fighting EOKA: The British Counter- Insurgency Campaign on Cyprus, 1955-1959, pp.88-9 Grivas\u2019 memoirs describe the event as a disaster for the British in which a small band of EOKA fighters took on a large ambushing force of British soldiers. He claims that he heard after the fact that there were at least 50 casualties although British sources claim \u2018two slightly wounded\u2019. Grivas claims Lieutenant Colonel Tailyour was killed in action even though Tailyour went on to serve as Commandant General Royal Marines dying in 1979. British sources state that a Greek man was arrested in the vicinity carrying a rifle and cordex fuses and gave Grivas\u2019 location away during interrogation. A 40 man patrol then set off in search of the hideout. Grivas and his men managed to escape and 2 Marines were \u2018slightly wounded\u2019 in a friendly fire incident when a mortar exploded on tree branches.Young, D. Four Five: The Story of 45 Commando, Royal Marines, 1943-1971, (1972) p.234 The engagement resulted in Grivas\u2019s escape but with the EOKA no longer able to operate in the Spilia area. ==References== * Grigoris Afxentiou, a Cypriot fighter * Learn About Cyprus article (Greek language article about Grigoris Afxentiou) * Spilia Category:1955 in Cyprus Spilia Category:Friendly fire incidents Category:EOKA Category:Cyprus Emergency Category:December 1955 events ",
