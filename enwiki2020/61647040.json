    "text": "Phi Lambda Theta (\u03a6\u039b\u0398) was a social fraternity founded at Pennsylvania State College in 1920 for students who belonged to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. It was originally named Three Links. ==History== November 18, 1920, is designated as Founders' Day as on that date the body first met as an organization officially recognized by the Pennsylvania College college board on fraternity affairs. The name was changed from Three Links to Phi Lambda Theta on May 11, 1922. Modification of the non-college lodge requirement was effected on September 13, 1922, and all lodge affiliations and connections were severed in January, 1924. In 1930 it was admitted to Junior membership in the National Interfraternity Conference. ==Chapters== As of 1930 it had five chapters: *Alpha - Pennsylvania State College - 1920 *Beta - Kansas State Agricultural College -1923 *Gamma - Bucknell University -1925 *Delta - Waynesburg College -1927 *Epsilon - Susquehanna University -1928 ==Dissolution== The Kansas State and Susquehanna chapters became chapters of Beta Kappa in 1938 through separate petitions and the founding chapter was absorbed into Alpha Tau Omega. It appears that about that time the chapter at Bucknell became a local under that name, and in 1984 joined Chi Phi as Phi Lambda Theta chapter. ==References== Category:Defunct former members of the North American Interfraternity Conference Category:Student organizations established in 1920 Category:1920 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
