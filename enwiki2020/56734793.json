The Barren Fork Coal Camp was active until the mine was closed, upon vote by miners to join the United Mine Workers union. The district included three contributing structures and eight contributing sites. The historic function was as a processing site, for industry/processing/extraction. It was listed for its information potential. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Kentucky Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1879 Category:McCreary County, Kentucky Category:Coal mining in Appalachia ",
