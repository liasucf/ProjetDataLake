    "text": "Eby G. Friedman is an electrical engineer, and Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester. Friedman is also a Visiting Professor at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. He is a Senior Fulbright Fellow and a Fellow of the IEEE. ==Early life and education== Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1957, he earned an electrical engineering baccalaureate degree from Lafayette College in 1979, a master's degree (1981) and a doctoral degree (1989) from the University of California, Irvine, also in electrical engineering. Friedman married his wife Laurie Friedman in 1984, and they have two sons. ==Career== Friedman's research interests include integrated circuits, VLSI design and analysis, clock synchronization, power delivery, 3-D integration, and mixed-signal circuits. His career began in the Netherlands in 1978, working at Philips Gloeilampen Fabreiken on designing bipolar differential amplifiers. From 1979 to 1991 he worked at Hughes Aircraft Company, developing a large variety of integrated circuits for US military and commercial applications. He joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty at the University of Rochester in 1991. He received the 2005 William H. Riker University Award for Graduate Teaching at the University of Rochester. In 2012 he became a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE CAS Society,' and in 2013, he was awarded the Charles A. Desoer Technical Achievement Award, as a Fellow of the IEEE. In October 2015 he was inducted into the University of California, Irvine, Engineering Hall of Fame. He also received the IEEE CAS Mac Van Valkenburg award in 2018. === Service === ==== Editing ==== Friedman serves as editor-in-chief of the Microelectronics Journal and is a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Low Power Electronics and Applications. He is a past editor-in-chief and chair of the steering committee for the IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems as well as past regional editor of the Journal of Circuits, Systems and Computers. He formerly served as a member of several editorial boards: the Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, the Journal of VLSI Signal Processing, and the Proceedings of the IEEE and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing. ==== Committee work ==== Friedman has served multiple IEEE societies and committees: Circuits and Systems (CAS) Society Board of Governors and CAS liaison to the Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS);' past chair of the VLSI Systems and Applications Circuits and Systems Society Technical Committee; and past chair of the Electron Devices Chapter of the Rochester Section.' ==== Selected workshops and conferences ==== He was General/Program/Technical Co- Chair, for the 1997 International Workshop on Clock Distribution Networks. He has also chaired the following IEEE events: the 2000 Workshop on Signal Processing Systems, the 2003 and 2004 IEEE International Workshop on System- on-Chip for Real-Time Applications, technical program chair of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems, the 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, and the 2007 IEEE International Symposium on Networks on Chip (NoC). ==Publications and patents== Friedman has published more than 500 papers and is co-inventor of 20 patents. ===Books=== * Clock Distribution Networks in VLSI Circuits and Systems (IEEE Press, 1995) * High Performance Clock Distribution Networks (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997) * Analog Design Issues in Digital VLSI Circuits and Systems (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997) * Timing Optimization through Clock Skew Scheduling ( 2000 and 2009)(first and second edition) * On- Chip Inductance in High Speed Integrated Circuits (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001) * Power Distribution Networks in High Speed Integrated Circuits (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004) * Multi-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design (John Wiley & Sons Press, 2006) * Power Distribution Networks with On-Chip Decoupling Capacitors (Springer Verlag, 2008 and 2011)(first and second edition) * Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuit Design (Morgan Kaufmann, 2009 and 2017)(first and second edition) * High Performance Integrated Circuit Design (McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2012) * On-Chip Power Delivery and Management (Springer, 2016) ===Selected articles=== * I.
