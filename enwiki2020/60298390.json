Folio,Barcelona, pp:123 It is usually served hot and freshly made. This type of sandwich (specifically the simple version without sauce) is very popular in Madrid and can be found in most of the bars of the Spanish capital, particularly in the Plaza Mayor as well as the Calle de Botoneras at the southeast corner of Plaza Mayor.Joaqu\u00edn de Entrambasaguas, (1971), \"Gastronom\u00eda Madrile\u00f1a\", Instituto de Estudios Madrile\u00f1os, p\u00e1g. 23 In Zaragoza, the sophisticated version of the calamari sandwich is traditional, with the spicy sauce (tomato, mayonnaise and garlic), and it is called bocadillo de calamares bravos or spicy squid sandwich, which is served in the bars on Calle Cinco de Marzo. ==Preparation== The squid are usually cut into rings that are one-centimeter thick, coated with flour and baking powder. After this initial preparation, they are fried in hot oil until they are golden brown.Manuel Mart\u00ednez Llopis, Simone Ortega, (1987), \u00abLa cocina t\u00edpica de Madrid\u00bb, Alianza Editorial. p\u00e1g. 311 In Zaragoza, spicy tomato-based sauce, mayonnaise and garlic will be added. The bread is usually sliced on one side. Traditionally, it was served with bread full of fried breadcrumbs.Francisco G\u00f3mez Porro, (2003), La conquista de Madrid: paletos, provincianos e inmigrantes, Silex Ediciones, Madrid, p\u00e1g. 170 Recently, baguettes from the establishment are usually made from previously frozen dough, which is usually cut on one side, giving each place a characteristic touch. ==Presentation== Sometimes a bit of squeezed lemon is added to the fried squid dish for flavor, and mayonnaise is also common. It is usually accompanied with a very cold beer. The squids are usually served in a bread that is opened only on one side and is filled with fried breadcrumbs. ==Variations== The bocadillo de rabas or \"fried squid ring sandwich\" is very popular in northern Spain, where fresh squid can be found on the coast. The way of preparation is similar to the Madrid version and they can be found in various bars and restaurants in Cantabria, as well as in the Basque Country. In Madrid, there are even \"Rutas del Bocadillo de Calamares\" (Routes of Squid Sandwiches) that allow you to discover variants of the sandwich. ==See also== * Squid as food ==References== Category:Seafood sandwiches Category:Squid dishes ",
