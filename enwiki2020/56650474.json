Because of her father's military profession, which caused him to be sent on missions in Germany, as well as to different garrisons in the country, Carmen never stayed more than seven months at one school. She lived between Santiago, other cities of the country, Peru, and Europe, and learned to speak German before Spanish. However, she attended the French Nuns, a women's college where she was the \"wild card\" of the course for any artistic competition involving dancing or acting. When she was 14 her father was assigned as Chilean ambassador to Germany, and that change marked her life. It was 1940 and World War II was in full development. A lot of people Barros' age that she met on this trip she never saw again; they joined Hitler's army to colonize Europe and fell out of contact. As a counterpoint, the cultural opportunities of Berlin influenced her future career: concerts, opera, theater; despite the horror of the war, that never changed. She tried to resume her basic education, in a German school, but could not stand being in a co-educational one, so she chose to retire and take private classes at home. However she never finished her studies. At age 19 Barros returned to Chile, but everything had changed. Santiago del Campo offered to let her sing on the radio and gave her the pseudonym Marianela. She had begun her career as a singer. She worked at Radio Agricultura, Corporaci\u00f3n, and Miner\u00eda. In 1946, when a company of New York's Metropolitan Opera House came to Chile with the Beethoven opera Fidelio, Barros was invited to participate.

Her brother was the one who spurred her interest in theater. He was an actor and creator of the Pocket Theater, and invited her to participate in the play Carlos y Ana, which she starred in. She also worked with , combining her talents for singing and the theater. This continued until her father was named ambassador to Italy, and the dream vanished.

She continued with her \"operatic\" work, went to live in Vienna, and was invited to take a leading role in the Opera of Brussels, Belgium. However her father was named chancellor and had to return home. She could never reconcile her dreams with distance. Although she endured another year without seeing her children, finally, and although her prospects were favorable, she returned to Chile in 1957.

She shared the stage with , Ana Gonz\u00e1lez, and many other luminaries, and starred as the first Carmela. Also in 1965 she had a musical group, Los Gatos, which was very successful. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, she went to Kenya and worked as a UN official for nine years. Then she returned to Chile and began appearing on television.
