Adolphe Thiers, who was at this time minister of public works, now commissioned him to execute the two groups of Peace and War, flanking the arch on the east facade of the Arc de Triomphe. This last, which established his reputation, he reproduced in marble in the Paris Salon of 1839. The French capital contains numerous examples of the sculptural works of \u00c9tex, which included mythological and religious subjects besides a great number of portraits. Among the best known of his architectural productions is \u00c9tex's tomb of Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, which includes a bronze figure of the painter, and a low-relief version the painter's controversial Raft of the Medusa on a front panel. \u00c9tex's paintings include the subjects of Eurydice and the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, and he also wrote a number of essays on subjects connected with the arts. The last year of his life was spent at Nice, and he died at Chaville, Seine-et-Oise in 1888. He was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse in Paris. ==Works== * Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, marble, 1830, Clamecy, coll\u00e9giale Saint-Martin * Ca\u00efn et sa race maudits de Dieu, marble, (1832\u20131839), Lyon, mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts * La R\u00e9sistance de 1814, stone, (1833\u20131837), Paris, arc de triomphe de l'\u00c9toile, western fa\u00e7adeInsecula.com * La Paix, stone, (1833\u20131837), Paris, arc de triomphe de l'\u00c9toile, western fa\u00e7adeInsecula.com * Tombeau de G\u00e9ricault, Paris, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, its plaster model was at the 1841 Salon, Rouen, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts * Portrait de L\u00e9on Pelet, bust, marble, 1848, Paris, mus\u00e9e du LouvreCartelfr.louvre.fr * Portrait du baron Dufour, maire de Metz (1769\u20131842), medal, marble, 1845, Metz, Grand salon de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville * M\u00e9daillon du po\u00e8te Auguste Brizeux (1803\u20131858) at the cemetery of Carnel in Lorient; medal, marble, 1858 ==Gallery== Image:Perelachaise- Gericault-p1000404.jpg|G\u00e9ricault's tomb, showing front panel Image:Paris Arc de Triomphe 02.jpg|Peace, east facade of the Arc de Triomphe Image:Paris Arc de Triomphe 03.jpg|The Resistance, east facade of the Arc de Triomphe ==References== * PE Mangeant, Antoine \u00c9tex, peintre, sculpteur et architecte, 1808-1888 (Paris, 1894). == External links == * Category:1808 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery Category:19th-century French architects Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:Artists from Paris Category:19th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors Category:19th-century male artists ",
