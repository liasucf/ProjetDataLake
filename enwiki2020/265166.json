    "text": "right Project Rastko \u2014 Internet Library of Serb Culture () is a non-profit and non-governmental publishing, cultural and educational project dedicated to Serb and Serb-related arts and humanities. It is named after Rastko Nemanji\u0107. ==Project== The project was established in 1997 as a part of a pan-regional Balkans Cultural Network Initiative . Its main activities are: * electronic publishing in the fields of Serbian and Serbian-related arts and humanities * scientific and cultural conferences and studies about Balkan cultural- civilizational integration * bilateral and multilateral activities with other Balkan and world countries * establishing regional centres * technical training The apex of the project is its electronic library with more than half a gigabyte of material, comprising electronic books and articles, photographs and comics. Though most texts are in Serbian language there is a body of material in other languages, again mostly in English and Russian, but also in French, German, Spanish and other languages. The library contains material in both the public domain and copyrighted texts published with the authors' permissions, dating from earliest medieval Serb texts to contemporary science fiction. The site of the project also hosts several sites not directly related to the project. Project Rastko also hosts the European version of Distributed Proofreaders, which intends to supply Project Gutenberg with public domain texts in European languages. Project Rastko is organising a coalition of European e-libraries for the purpose of collecting public domain works, aiming to eventually have a node of Distributed Proofreaders in each European country. ==Centres== Currently (2007) the project has following regional centres: # Denmark (Projekt Rastko \u2014 Denmark, network of electronic libraries and achievements regarding Danish culture and Danish-Serbian cultural and historical links) # Republic of Macedonia (Project Rastko \u2014 Macedonia, electronic library of culture and tradition of Macedonia) # Russia (Project Rastko \u2014 Russia) # The Drina (Project Rastko \u2014 The Drina, electronic library of culture and tradition of the Drina) # Kashubians (Project Rastko \u2014 Kashubia, e-library of culture and tradition of Kashubians) # Slovenia (Project Rastko \u2014 Slovenia, e-library of Slovenian-Serbian cultural ties) # Gora (Project Rastko \u2014 Gora, e-library of culture and tradition of Gora and Goranies) # Poland (Project Rastko \u2014 Poland, library of Polish-Serbian cultural links) # Lusatia (Project Rastko \u2014 Lusatia, electronic library of Sorbian-Serbian cultural ties) # Bulgaria (Project Rastko \u2014 Bulgaria, library of Bulgarian-Serbian cultural links) # Albania (Project Rastko \u2014 Shkoder, library of Slavs in Albania and Albanian-Slavic cultural links) # Bosnian Krajina (Project Rastko \u2014 Banja Luka, electronic library of culture and tradition of the Bosnian Krajina) # Ukraine (Project Rastko \u2014 Kiev-Lavov, electronic library of Ukrainian-Serbian cultural links) # Hungary (Project Rastko \u2014 Budapest-Saint Andrew, library of culture and tradition of the Serbs in Hungary) # Bay of Kotor (Project Rastko \u2014 Bay of Kotor, electronic library of culture and tradition of Bocca) # Montenegro (Project Rastko \u2014 Cetinje, electronic library of culture and tradition of Montenegro) # Kosovo (Project Rastko \u2014 Kosovo and Metohija, electronic library of culture and tradition of the southern Serbian province) # Romania (Project Rastko \u2014 Romania, library of the culture of Serbs in Romania) # Italy (Rastko Project \u2014 Italy, electronic library of Serbian-Italian cultural links) Each of them is autonomous, and develops its projects and activities through local academic, cultural, media NGOs and individuals, including strong co-operation with ethnic minorities centres.
