    "text": "Tari\u00e1curi (fl. ca. 1350) was a culture hero of the Pur\u00e9pecha people and one of the foremost rulers of the Tarascan state. Traditionally hailed as the state's founder, Tari\u00e1curi is credited with growing the Tarascan state from an individual city-state to the dominant power of the region. == Biography == Tari\u00e1curi (meaning \"strong wind\") was born into the uac\u00fasecha clan, one of the most powerful families of the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro basin, in the fourteenth century CE. His father and predecessor, Pauacume II, ruled as the lord of P\u00e1tzcuaro. Tari\u00e1curi's career began with a prophetic dream he had, in which the sun god Curicaueri\u2014 the patron deity of the uac\u00fasecha\u2014 sent him forth to create and expand a unified Tarascan state. To put this ambition into practice, he first joined forces with allied cities, including Urichu, Erongar\u00edcuaro, Pech\u00e1taro, and Jar\u00e1cuaro; he then began expanding the state's territory, first to the southwest and then throughout the entire P\u00e1tzcuaro basin. Tari\u00e1curi's military record was not perfectly successful\u2014 at one point, \"enemies from Curinguaro\" are described as attacking his homeland and forcing his nephews into flight\u2014 but this seems to have been a temporary setback, after which Tari\u00e1curi managed to resume his program of expansion.Roth-Seneff et al., 123\u201324. After Tari\u00e1curi's death, his domain was divided among several of his descendants: his son Hiquingaje received rulership of P\u00e1tzcuaro, while Tari\u00e1curi's nephews Tangaxoan and Hiripan were granted Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatzio respectively. They would follow Tari\u00e1curi's pattern, however, by maintaining an alliance and continuing efforts to expand the Tarascan state. == References == Category:14th-century rulers Category:Pur\u00e9pecha people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
