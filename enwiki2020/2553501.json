    "text": "World Productions is a British television production company, founded on 20 March 1990 by acclaimed producer Tony Garnett, and owned by ITV plc following a takeover in 2017. ==History== The company's first major series was the police drama Between the Lines (BBC1, 1992\u201394), and throughout the decade they went on to produce a succession of drama series. The most notable of these include This Life (BBC2, 1996\u201397), about a group of young law students in London; vampire-based thriller Ultraviolet (Channel 4, 1998); and a police series for the BBC, The Cops (BBC2, 1998\u201399), which was so controversial in its depiction of the police force that official police advice was withdrawn for the second series. More recently, the company has made the series No Angels (2004\u20132006), a drama based around the lives of young nurses, and Goldplated for Channel 4. For Channel Five, it produced the Perfect Day trilogy and Tripping Over, a co-production with Network Ten in Australia. It also co-produced a one-off This Life + 10 reunion special with BBC Wales, transmitted in early 2007. ===Marcus Evans takeover=== It was announced in February 2012 that the company had been taken over by Marcus Evans Entertainment owned by billionaire businessman and owner of Ipswich Town F.C., Marcus Evans. Evans's company had been looking to get involved with television and film production for a number of years beforehand, and in 2010, set up its own production operation, Marcus Evans Entertainment. === Takeover by ITV plc === ITV plc announced in May 2017 that they had taken over World Productions. As a result of the deal, World Productions became a unit of ITV Studios and ITV Studios Global Entertainment began distributing all future series internationally. In 2018, the series Bodyguard which World Productions produced, become the most-watched TV show in the UK since 2008, achieving approximately 10.4 million viewers throughout the programme. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !
