The University of T\u00fcbingen is one of eleven German Excellence Universities. The University of T\u00fcbingen is especially known as a centre for the study of medicine, law, archeology, ancient cultures, philosophy, theology and religious studies. The university's noted alumni include presidents, ministers, EU Commissioners and judges of the Federal Constitutional Court. The university is associated with eleven Nobel laureates, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry. The Neue Aula ==History== The University of T\u00fcbingen was founded in 1477 by Count Eberhard V (Eberhard im Bart, 1445\u20131496), later the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, a civic and ecclesiastic reformer who established the school after becoming absorbed in the Renaissance revival of learning during his travels to Italy. Its first rector was Johannes Nauclerus. Its present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder. The university later became the principal university of the kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. Today, it is one of nine state universities funded by the German federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The Alte Aula (Old Auditorium) The University of T\u00fcbingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in theology, in which the university and the T\u00fcbinger Stift are famous to this day. Philipp Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction. Among T\u00fcbingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst K\u00f6hler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. \"The T\u00fcbingen Three\" refers to H\u00f6lderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the T\u00fcbinger Stift. Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar T\u00fcbingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951. The university rose to the height of its prominence in the middle of the 19th century with the teachings of poet and civic leader Ludwig Uhland and the Protestant theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur, whose circle, colleagues and students became known as the \"T\u00fcbingen School\", which pioneered the historical-critical analysis of biblical and early Christian texts, an approach generally referred to as \"higher criticism.\" The University of T\u00fcbingen also was the first German university to establish a faculty of natural sciences, in 1863. DNA was discovered in 1868 at the University of T\u00fcbingen by Friedrich Miescher. Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, the first female Nobel Prize winner in medicine in Germany, also works at T\u00fcbingen. The faculty for economics and business was founded in 1817 as the \"Staatswissenschaftliche Fakult\u00e4t\" and was the first of its kind in Germany. ===Nazi period=== The University played a leading role in efforts to legitimize the policies of the Third Reich as \"scientific\". Even before the victory of the Nazi Party in the general election in March 1933, there were hardly any Jewish faculty and a few Jewish students. Physicist Hans Bethe was dismissed on 20 April 1933 because of \"non-Aryan\" origin. Religion professor Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich and the mathematician Erich Kamke were forced to take early retirement, probably in both cases the \"non-Aryan\" origin of their wives.Juden an der Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen im Nationalsozialismus (PDF; 132 kB), Bericht des Arbeitskreises \u201eUniversit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen im Nationalsozialismus\u201c, 19. Januar 2006 At least 1158 people were sterilized at the University Hospital. ===After the war=== In 1966, Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become Pope Benedict XVI, was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology in the Faculty of Catholic Theology at T\u00fcbingen, where he was a colleague of Hans K\u00fcng.Kupferbau AuditoriumIn 1967, J\u00fcrgen Moltmann (b. 1926), one of the most influential Protestant theologians of the 20th century, was appointed Professor of Systematic Theology in the Faculty of Protestant Theology. Drafted in 1944 by Nazi Germany, he was an Allied prisoner of war 1945\u20131948. He was influenced by his colleague and friend Ernst Bloch, the Marxist philosopher. In 1970, the university was restructured into a series of faculties as independent departments of study and research after the manner of French universities. The university made the headlines in November 2009 when a group of left-leaning students occupied one of the main lecture halls, the Kupferbau, for several days. The students' goal was to protest tuition fees and maintain that education should be free for everyone. In May 2010, T\u00fcbingen joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden). ==Research focus== The University of T\u00fcbingen undertakes a broad range of research projects in various fields. Among the more prominent ones in the natural sciences are the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, which focuses on general, cognitive and cellular neurology as well as neurodegeneration, and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, which deals primarily with cell biology in diagnostics and therapy of organ system diseases. In the liberal arts, the University of T\u00fcbingen is noteworthy for having the only faculty of rhetoric in Germany \u2013 the department was founded by Walter Jens, an important intellectual and literary critic. The university also boasts continued pre-eminence in its centuries-old traditions of research in the fields of philosophy, theology and philology. Since at least the nineteenth century, T\u00fcbingen has been the home of world-class research in prehistoric studies and the study of antiquity, including the study of the ancient Near East; a particular focus of the research in these areas at the University of T\u00fcbingen has been Anatolia, e.g., through the continued excavations of the university at Troy. ==Campus== 210x210px The University of T\u00fcbingen is not a campus university, but is spread throughout the town: T\u00fcbingen is one of five classical \"university towns\" in Germany. The other four are Marburg, G\u00f6ttingen, Freiburg and Heidelberg. In T\u00fcbingen there are four areas with a major concentration of university institutions. *The university uses a number of buildings in the old town of T\u00fcbingen, some of which date back to the foundation of the university. Today, these are mainly used by smaller humanities departments, as is the adjacent medieval castle, Schloss Hohent\u00fcbingen. *Northeast of the old town, the Wilhelmstra\u00dfe area surrounding the street of the same name is home to larger humanities departments as well as the university's administration. The main university library and main refectory are also in this area. * A new campus for the sciences was built in the 1970s at Morgenstelle, a hill north of the historic centre of T\u00fcbingen. Facilities include a large refectory.Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, part of the Klinikum * The university's teaching hospitals are located between the Wilhelmstra\u00dfe area and the Morgenstelle campus in an area collectively known as the Klinikum. The 17 hospitals in T\u00fcbingen affiliated with the university's faculty of medicine have 1,500 patient beds, and cater to 66,000 in-patients and 200,000 out-patients on an annual basis.Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen \u2013 \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber die Zahl der Studierenden und Gasth\u00f6rer im Sommersemester 2008 .

In interdisciplinary exhibitions, both the broader public should be provided with insights into the history of science as well as researched in the field of science itself. In addition, the master's degree program \"Museum & Collections\" of the MUT, with the participation of six humanities and cultural studies subjects, offers the training of students in the field of exhibitions. Ancient Egyptian Coffin of Idi from Assiut, mid-12th dynasty Eight scientific teaching collections \u2013 Origins of Art, Pile Dwellings + Celts, Cuneiform, Gods + Tombs, Ancient Art, Ancient Coins, Ancient Sculptures \u2013 are open to the public in the Museum Alte Kulturen and in the permanent exhibition WeltKulturen in Hohent\u00fcbingen Castle. In addition, there are other, partially accessible scientific teaching collections on Hohent\u00fcbingen: Cradle of Biochemistry (Schlosslabor), BildBestand, Everyday Culture, AntikenBilder, Professor Gallery (partial), Castle Church and TonSteineScherben. The MUT \u2013 and thus the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen \u2013 is the only university institution in the world to house artefacts with world heritage status, such as the oldest surviving figurative works of art and musical instruments of humanity, mammoth ivory figures and fragments of bone flutes. These come from the Vogelherdh\u00f6hle (Swabian Alb), which has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage \"Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura\" since 2017. ==Libraries== 208x208px The University Library of T\u00fcbingen is not just available to those affiliated with the university, but also to the general public. The library provides more than three million individual volumes and more than 7,600 journals. Apart from the main library, more than 80 departmental libraries containing an additional three million volumes are also associated with the university. The main lending library is located on Wilhelmstra\u00dfe and consists of several different parts which are connected through corridors and walkways: *The Bonatzbau, the library's oldest building, was built in 1912 and currently houses the historical reading room (Historischer Lesesaal), the university archive, along with a number of manuscript collections. *The library's main building, constructed in 1963, contains the information desk and research stations to access electronic catalogues and databases. *Interior of the Historical Reading HallThe Ammerbau is the most recent addition to the library complex. Built in 2002, it offers users direct access to over 300,000 volumes and latest issues of newspapers, magazines and journals. It also contains numerous work places and separate individual rooms for group work. ==Organisation== ===Faculties=== 204x204px The university is made up of 7 faculties, some of which are subdivided into further departments.Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen \u2013 Faculties.

The Eberhard Karls University is the only university in the German-speaking world that teaches rhetoric as an independent subject of study.The first professor of General Rhetoric in T\u00fcbingen was the world-famous philologist, literature historian, and writer Walter Jens. ===Controversies=== T\u00fcbingen's self-conception has sometimes been controversially discussed as being elitist. Since almost all German universities are public (most private universities do not have the official German \"Universit\u00e4tsstatus\"), and therefore mainly paid by taxes and generally egalitarian, there is no German Ivy League of institutions of higher education. Moreover, the German Universities Excellence Initiative aims to promote cutting-edge research, to create outstanding conditions for young scientists at universities, and to strengthen some selected universities more than others in order to raise their international visibility. This self- conception is also of historical interest: from 1900 to 1929 members of the Studentenverbindungen in T\u00fcbingen already understood themselves as the German national elite (\"F\u00fchrer der Nation\").Cf. Levsen, S., Elite M\u00e4nnlichkeit und Krieg. T\u00fcbinger und Cambridger Studenten 1900\u20131929, G\u00f6ttingen 2006, esp. 11. Every May until 2008, fraternities of the \"T\u00fcbinger Waffenring\" organized a big torchlight procession and sang traditional German songs in the old town (\"Maieinsingen\"), accompanied by a counter-demonstrations of extreme left-wing student groups.Video: Maisingen und Protest auf dem Holzmarkt, T\u00fcbingen Maieinsingen 1995. This event has since been replaced by a public fest organized by all student fraternities and sororities that is open to everyone and which is publicly endorsed by the mayor Boris Palmer, though criticism from radical left students still emerges. In 1969, the progressive political and theological climate alienated Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) and led to his short-lived tenure at the university. According to the Swabian daily newspaper, the Schw\u00e4bisches Tagblatt, Ratzinger was theologically \"traumatized\" at the University of T\u00fcbingen. In Aus meinem Leben: Erinnerungen he describes the liberalism of T\u00fcbingen's student activism as \"the cruel countenance of this atheistic devoutness\" (\"das grausame Antlitz dieser atheistischen Fr\u00f6mmigkeit\"). Cf. Ratzinger, J., Aus meinem Leben. Erinnerungen (1927\u20131977), Stuttgart 1998, 134\u2013152. Since 2018, the University has been part of a wider artificial intelligence research initiative named Cyber Valley. Cyber Valley has seen investments from multinational companies poured into establishing research centers, research groups, and professorships in the city. The investing organisations and corporations include Google, Amazon, BMW, IAV, Daimler, Porsche, and Bosch. The Cyber Valley initiative has attracted criticism from student groups and activist groups alike, with many protest actions, including building occupations and demonstrations, having taken place decrying both the commercialisation of University research and the involvement of the University with organisations that are engaged in military research. ==Student life== Sculpture Urpferd at campus Morgenstelle As the university's students make up roughly a third of the total population of T\u00fcbingen, the town's culture is to a large extent dominated by them. Consequently, there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer, when a large number of otherwise regular events do not take place. Around 30 Studentenverbindungen, the German type of fraternities, are associated with the university. While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly \"Stocherkahn-Rennen\" punting- boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged rightwing policial views, leading to strong criticism from leftist groups.AK Clubhausia: Argumente gegen das Hofieren reaktion\u00e4rer Seilschaften. Fachschaftsr\u00e4te-VV. Retrieved on 25 October 2007. The university itself takes a neutral stance on this issue. However, all of T\u00fcbingen's fraternities distance themselves from the fraternities of the Deutsche Burschenschaft, which have been widely criticized as adhering to far- right principles. Fraternity house on the \u00d6sterberg Also closely linked to the university are a number of student societies representing mainly the arts and political parties. Most notable are a number of choirs as well as student theatre groups affiliated with the faculty of Modern Languages, some of which perform in foreign languages. Radio Uniwelle T\u00fcbingen is the university's radio station, airing seven hours of programmes a week produced by students under the supervision of staff employed by the university.Uniwelle T\u00fcbingen \u2013 Radioprogramm der Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen .

Since T\u00fcbingen has a department of sports science with a broad range of facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals. Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as parachuting or martial arts, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at reduced rates. The sports department is located close to the Wilhelmstra\u00dfe area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes. Stocherk\u00e4hne during the traditional annual race Unlike in some major cities, student discounts are not widely available in T\u00fcbingen. Cinemas and the town council's public library in particular do not offer discounts for students, and there are only a handful of restaurants which have reduced lunch deals. However, students may benefit from the Semesterticket, a heavily discounted public transport season pass offering six months of unlimited travel on trains and buses in the naldo Verkehrsverbund transport association for approximately \u20ac62.50.NALDO \u2013 Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb-Donau GmbH: Semesterticket .

Nightlife in T\u00fcbingen is centered on the numerous pubs in the old town along with a number of clubs, most of which dedicate themselves to non- mainstream music. During the semester, the Studentenwerk-owned Clubhaus at the centre of the Wilhelmstra\u00dfe university area hosts the weekly Clubhausfest on Thursday nights. This popular, free-entry club night is organized and promoted by student societies and Fachschaft student representative bodies and all proceeds go towards their activities in support of students. ==Points of interest== Castle Hohent\u00fcbingen during the T\u00fcbingen Kulturnacht 2016 * Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, the university's botanical garden * The university\u00b4s geological trail at Kirnberg:Johannes Baier: Der Geologische Lehrpfad am Kirnberg (Keuper; SW-Deutschland) . \u2013 Jber.
