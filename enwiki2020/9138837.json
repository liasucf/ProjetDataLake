During his tenure as Deputy Premier, Kennett's Liberals actually held a majority in their own right. Although Kennett did not need the support of McNamara's Nationals, the coalition was retained. Following the defeat of the Liberal-National coalition at the 1999 Victorian election, McNamara resigned the party leadership. A year later, he resigned from parliament, triggering a by-election which resulted in the Nationals losing the seat to the Labor Party.McLeod, Shane: Nationals in shock after Benalla, The World Today (ABC Local Radio), 15 May 2000. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Delegates to the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998 Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:Deputy Premiers of Victoria Category:RMIT University alumni Category:People educated at Xavier College Category:Politicians from Melbourne ",
