This was the second year that the league played with 16 teams. Teams played home and away with one another each playing 28 matches. Eftekhar Shushtar finished the season on top of the standings and was promoted to division 3 of the Iranian football system. Meanwhile, with Esteghlal Veys' withdrawal from the league, they will be relegated to the Khuzestan Division 1 along with last place finishers Esteghlal Abadan. ==League changes== During week 4 of the season, Esteghlal Veys did not take the field against Jonub Susangerd due to monetary issues. The team officially withdrew from the league prior to the start of week 5 matches. The league continued with the remaining 15 teams and Esteghlal's results were removed from league records. Week 30 was scheduled to take place prior to the New Year, however, due to bad weather conditions, the league cancelled 4 matches while playing only those matches that would alter the league champion and the team being relegated. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Team !Location !Stadium !Capacity |- |Eftekhar Shushtar |Shushtar |Takhti Shushtar Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Etehad Safi Abad Dezful |Dezful |Majidian Dezful Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Parsa Bagh-e malek |Bagh-e Malek |Bagh-e Malek Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Jonub Susangerd |Susangerd |Takhti Susangerd Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Farhang Ramhormoz |Ramhormoz |Takhti Ramhormoz Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Abi Pooshan Hamidieh |Hamidie |Takhti Hamidieh Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Jonub Sheiban |Mollasani |Molasani Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Esteghlal Zeydun |Zeydun |Zeydun Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Bahmaei Ramhormoz |Ramhormoz |Takhti Ramhormoz Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Anzan Izeh |Izeh |Takhti Izeh Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Iranmehr Khoramshahr |Khoramshahr |Jahan Ara Khoramshahr Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Persepolis Shush |Shush |Takhti Shush Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Persepolis Veys |Veys |Veys Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Shahrdari Bandar-e Emam |Bandar-e Emam |Takhti Bandar-e Emam Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Esteghlal Abadan |Abadan |Shahrdari Abadan Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Esteghlal Veys |Ahvaz |Navard & Luleh Ahvaz Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 1,000 |} == Final Standings == ==Results== == See also == * 2018\u201319 Azadegan League * 2018\u201319 League 2 * 2018\u201319 League 3 * 2018\u201319 Hazfi Cup * 2019 Iranian Super Cup == References == 1 Iran Category:Khuzestan Premier League ",
