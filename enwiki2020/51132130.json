The album features guest appearance by British singer-songwriter Izzy Bizu. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, Warm on a Cold Night received generally positive reviews from music critics. Writing for AllMusic, Liam Martin gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and highlighted the tracks, \"Warm on a Cold Night\", \"Someone That Loves You\" and \"Treat You Right\". Lisa Henderson from Clash magazine called the album as \"an irresistible piece of steamy electro-soul\" and gave the album an 8 out of 10, while Kitty Empire from The Observer called it \"danceable, but not braindead\". Writing for NOW Magazine, Paula Reid gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying, \"Andy and James stepped deeper into their own sound, with more inventive lyrics and dynamic melodies.\" Reid also noted the 1970s and 1980s soul and funk influences in the album. The Guardian gave a mixed review of the album, saying, \"a studied sort of soul that belongs more in a Spotify aggregated playlist than on a sleazy late-night radio show.\" Liam McNeilly from DIY Magazine gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, saying, \"Honne\u2019s debut could be a triumph, but finds itself prone to mumbling and shallowness.\" ==Commercial performance== Warm on a Cold Night made its debut in United Kingdom at number thirty-seven. The album sold 2,227 copies in its first week. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal. All tracks written by Andy Clutterbuck and James Hatcher, except where noted.
