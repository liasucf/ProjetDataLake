And this competition has given a level never reached before. The Dubai International Parachuting Championship (DIPC) is being held under the patronnage of his Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Duba\u00ee and Chairman of Duba\u00ef Sports Council. Sunshine and bright sky were present in the middle of Duba\u00ef higher buildings for this amazing showdown.

(Overall Rank is got by adding Style Rank and Accuracy Rank; it's a mix of the both disciplines. == Discover this Sport == You can find many disciplines in Parachuting. Thomas is practicing Accuracy Landing and Style in Competition. It can be easily seen as \"Athletics of Parachuting\". Thomas is also playing many ways in the sky: FreeFly / Video / Relative Work / Hybrid Parachut \u2026 This double discipline is requiring a perfect mastership of all sides in the Art of Flying. Style is a free flight discipline ( as sprint ) and Accuracy Landing is running with opened parachute. >> Pay attention that there's a specific classifying for each sport but there's also a combined classifying of both disciplines called \"overall\". \\---- === Accuracy Landing === Accuracy Landing \u2013 Thomas Jeannerot 2013 Accuracy Landing is running with opened parachute, in individual or team contest. The aim is to touch down on a target whose center is 2 cm in diameter. Target can be a deep foam mattress or an air-filled landing pad. An electronic recording pad of 32 cm in diameter is set in the middle. It measures score in 1 cm increments up to 16 cm and displays result just after landing. First part of any competition take place over 8 rounds. Then in the individual competition, after this 8 selective rounds, the top 25% jump a semi-final round. After semi-final round the top 50% are selected for the final round. Competitor with the lowest cumulative score is declared the winner. Competitors jump in teams of 5 maximum, exiting the aircraft at 1000 or 1200 meters and opening their parachutes sequentially to allow each competitor a clear approach to the target. This Sport is pretty unpredictable because Weather Conditions play a very important part. So Accuracy Landing requires high adaptability to aerology and excellent steering control. It's also the most interesting discipline for spectator due to the closeness of action (a few meters) and the possibility to be practiced everywhere (sport ground, stadium, urban place...). Today, Accuracy Landing is the most practiced (in competition) discipline of skydiving in the world. \\---- === Style === Style \u2013 Thomas Jeannerot Style \u2013 Thomas Jeannerot 2013 Style can be considered as sprint of parachuting. This individual discipline is played in free fall. The idea is to take maximum speed and complete a pre- designated series of manoeuvres as fast and cleanly as possible (speed can exceed 400 km/h / 250 mph) Jumps are filmed using a ground-based camera (with an exceptional lens to record the performance). Performance is timed (from the start of the manoeuvre until its completion) and then judged in public at the end of the jump. Competition includes 4 qualifying rounds and a final for the top 8. Competitors jump from a height of 2200 m to 2500 m. They rush into an acceleration stage for 15 to 20 seconds and then run their series of manoeuvres benefiting to the maximum of the stored speed. Those series consist of Turns and Back-Loops to achieve in a pre-designated order. Incorrect performance of the manoeuvres gives rise to penalties that are added at runtime. The performance of the athlete is defined in seconds and hundredths of a second. Competitor with the lowest cumulative time is declared the winner. Notice the complete sequence is performed by leading international experts in just over 6 seconds, penalties included. == Palmares (end of 2018) == ===World Record=== * World Record of Accuracy Landing Individual \u2013 2013 (Dubai) * World Record of Accuracy Landing Team \u2013 2011 (Kikinda) \\---- ===International=== ==== Championship ==== * 3rd of European Championship \u2013 Accuracy Landing Individual \u2013 2018 (Erden) * 3rd of European Championship \u2013 Overall \u2013 2018 (Erden) * European Vice-Champion in Accuracy Landing Individual \u2013 2011 (Kikinda) * European Vice-Champion in Accuracy Landing Team \u2013 2011 (Kikinda) * 3rd of European Championship \u2013 Team Overall \u2013 2011 (Kikinda) * World Champion of Individual Overall \u2013 2010 (Niksic) * World Vice-Champion of Team Overall \u2013 2010 (Niksic) ==== World Cup ==== * 1st Team Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2018 (Peiting) * 1st Individual Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2017 (Locarno) * 1st Team Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2014 (Peiting) * 3rd Team Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2013 (Locarno) * 3rd Individual Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2012 (Bled) * 3rd Team Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2012 (Bled) * 2nd Individual Accuracy Landing World Cup \u2013 2005 (Belluno) ==== International Trophy ==== * Winner of the 4th Duba\u00ef International Parachuting Championship \u2013 Individual Accuracy Landing- 2013 (Dubai) * Winner of Marocco Trophy \u2013 Style \u2013 2013 (Beni Mellal) * Winner of Marocco Trophy \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2013 (Beni Mellal) * Winner of Accuracy European Master of Strasbourg \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2012 (Strasbourg) * 2nd of Accuracy European Master of Strasbourg \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2011 (Strasbourg) \\---- ===National=== ====France Championship==== * 3rd of France Championship \u2013 Individual Accuracy Landing \u2013 2017 (Vichy) * France Champion \u2013 Style \u2013 2016 (Vichy) * France Champion \u2013 Overall \u2013 2016 (Vichy) * France Champion \u2013 Accuracy Landing \u2013 2016 (Vichy) * France Champion \u2013 Style \u2013 2013 (Vichy) * France Champion \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2013 (Vichy) * France Vice-Champion \u2013 Individual Accuracy Landing \u2013 2009 (Maubeuge) * France Vice-Champion \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2008 (Metz) * 3rd of France Championship \u2013 Team Accuracy Landing \u2013 2003 / 2004 / 2007 ====France Cup==== * Winner of Individual France Cup * Winner of Team France Cup * 2nd Individual France Cup * 2nd Team France Cup * 3rd Individual France Cup * 3rd Team France Cup \\---- ===Junior=== ====International==== * European Champion \u2013 Style \u2013 2005 (Prost\u011bjov) * European Vice-Champion \u2013 Overall \u2013 2005 (Prost\u011bjov) * 3rd of European Championship \u2013 Accuracy Landing \u2013 2005 (Prost\u011bjov) ====National==== * France Champion \u2013 2003 / 2005 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008 * France Vice-Champion \u2013 2002 / 2003 / 2004 * 3rd of France Championship \u2013 2001 / 2002 / 2003 / 2005 / 2006 \\---- > Table showing Medals per Discipline {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !
