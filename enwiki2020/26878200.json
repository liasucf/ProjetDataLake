The cars for the 1987 World Touring Car Championship season were entered by Pro Team Italia/Imberti. The car was in Group A Division 3 competing against the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and later in the season Ford Sierra RS 500. The car was driven by Bruno Giacomelli, Armin Hahne, Marcello Gunella, Mario Hytten, Nicola Tesini and Kevin Bartlett. For the British Touring Car Championship the cars were entered by Trident Motorsport. This was for the 1988 and 1989 seasons. The car was driven by Nick May, John Lepp and Vic Lee. ==Rally cars== A former 1987 WTCC car was bought by Adriano Dece who converted it for used on road rallies and the company also manufactured the Maserati Biturbo Group A Rally car. ==Formula One== Maserati participated in Formula One motor racing during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Its works Formula One programme was broadly successful, providing a total of 9 Grand Prix wins for the factory team. In addition, Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1957 World Championship of Drivers with a Maserati 250F. Maserati designed two Formula One cars: the Maserati 4CLT and the Maserati 250F, and the pre-World War II Maserati 4CL was also used with some success. In addition, the Maserati A6GCM, designed as a Formula Two car, was also used in F1. Due to financial difficulties in the late 1950s the team had to withdraw from Formula One in 1958 despite the 250F still being successful. Privateers continued to use the 250F until 1960. In the 1960s, Maserati supplied engines to British Formula One team Cooper. The most successful car of that collaboration was the Cooper- Maserati T81, which had a Maserati V12 engine. It won the 1966 Mexican Grand Prix and the 1967 South African Grand Prix, driven by John Surtees and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez respectively. === Beginnings of Formula One operation === The 1948 Maserati 4CLT was one of the first cars built to the new Formula One regulations, introduced in 1946, and was developed from the 1938 Maserati 4CL voiturette car. The older design was still competitive despite the hiatus of World War II and was entered into Formula One races when racing resumed after the war. Its success encouraged Maserati to develop the car's design and these refinements were brought together as the 4CLT. === Complete Formula One results === == References == == External links == *maseraticorse.com Category:Maserati Category:Formula One constructors Category:Formula One entrants Category:Formula One engine manufacturers Category:Italian auto racing teams Category:Italian racecar constructors Category:Grand Prix teams Category:Sports car manufacturers Category:World Sportscar Championship teams Category:Vehicle constructors in motorsport Category:Auto racing teams established in 1950 Category:Auto racing teams disestablished in 1957 ",
