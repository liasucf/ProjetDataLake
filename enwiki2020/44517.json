    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Boucher ( , ; ; 29 September 1703 \u2013 30 May 1770) was a French painter, draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the Rococo style. Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated painter and decorative artist of the 18th century. ==Life== A native of Paris, Boucher was the son of a lesser known painter Nicolas Boucher, who gave him his first artistic training. At the age of seventeen, a painting by Boucher was admired by the painter Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne. Lemoyne later appointed Boucher as his apprentice, but after only three months, he went to work for the engraver Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cars.Alastair Laing. \"Boucher, Fran\u00e7ois.\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 June 2016 Portrait of Marie-Jeanne Buzeau, wife of Boucher by Alexander Roslin In 1720, he won the elite Grand Prix de Rome for painting, but did not take up the consequential opportunity to study in Italy until five years later, due to financial problems at the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. On his return from studying in Italy he was admitted to the refounded Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture on 24 November 1731.Levey, Michael. (1993) Painting and sculpture in France 1700\u20131789. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 164. His morceau de r\u00e9ception (reception piece) was his Rinaldo and Armida of 1734. Boucher married Marie-Jeanne Buzeau in 1733. The couple had three children together. Boucher became a faculty member in 1734 and his career accelerated from this point as he was promoted Professor then Rector of the Academy, becoming inspector at the Royal Gobelins Manufactory and finally Premier Peintre du Roi (First Painter of the King) in 1765. Portrait of Marie-Louise O'Murphy c. 1752 Boucher died on 30 May 1770 in his native Paris. His name, along with that of his patron Madame de Pompadour, had become synonymous with the French Rococo style, leading the Goncourt brothers to write: \"Boucher is one of those men who represent the taste of a century, who express, personify and embody it.\" Boucher is famous for saying that nature is \"trop verte et mal \u00e9clair\u00e9e\" (too green and badly lit). p. 86 (citing a letter to Nicolas Lancret). Boucher was associated with the gemstone engraver Jacques Guay, whom he taught to draw. He also mentored the Moravian-Austrian painter Martin Ferdinand Quadal as well as the neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David in 1767. Later, Boucher made a series of drawings of works by Guay which Madame de Pompadour then engraved and distributed as a handsomely bound volume to favored courtiers. ==Painting== The Secret Message Boucher took inspiration from artists such as Peter Paul Rubens and Antoine Watteau. Boucher's early works celebrate the idyllic and tranquil portrayal of nature and landscape with great elan. However, his art typically forgoes traditional rural innocence to portray scenes with a definitive style of eroticism as his mythological scenes are passionate and intimately amorous rather than traditionally epic. Boucher's paintings of a flirtatious shepherd and shepherdess in a woodland setting, featured in The Enjoyable Lesson (The Flute Players) of 1748 and An Autumn Pastoral (The Grape Eaters) of 1749, were based upon characters in a 1745 play by Boucher's close friend Charles-Simon Favart. Boucher's characters in those paintings later inspired a pair of figurines created by the S\u00e8vres Porcelain Manufactory, c. 1757\u201366. Marquise de Pompadour (mistress of King Louis XV), whose name became synonymous with Rococo art, was a great admirer of his work. Marquise de Pompadour is often referred to as the \"godmother of Rococo\" and Boucher's portraits were central to her self- presentation and cultivation of her image. For instance, Boucher's 'Sketch for a Portrait of Madame de Pompadour', displayed in the Starhemburg room at Waddesdon Manor, acts as a surviving example of the oil preparation prior to the, now lost, portrait. In one hand she holds her hat, in the other she picks up a pearl bracelet with a portrait of the king \u2013 symbolising the relationship upon which her status depends. Boucher's paintings such as The Breakfast (1739), a familial scene, show how he was as a master of the genre scene, where he regularly used his own wife and children as models. These intimate family scenes are contrasting to the licentious style seen in his Odalisque portraits. The dark-haired version of the Odalisque portraits prompted claims by the art critic Denis Diderot that Boucher was \"prostituting his own wife\", and the Blonde Odalisque was a portrait that illustrated the extramarital relationships of the King. Boucher gained lasting notoriety through such private commissions for wealthy collectors and, after Diderot expressed his disapproval, his reputation came under increasing critical attack during the last years of his career. ==Theatrical and tapestry designs== Jupiter and Callisto, 1759 Along with his painting, Boucher also designed theater costumes and sets, and the ardent intrigues of the comic operas of Charles Simon Favart closely paralleled his own style of painting. Tapestry design was also a concern. For the Beauvais tapestry workshops he first designed a series of F\u00eates italiennes (\"Italian festivals\") in 1736, which proved to be very successful and often rewoven over the years, and then, commissioned in 1737, a suite of the story of Cupid and Psyche.Kathryn B. Hiesinger, \"The Sources of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's 'Psyche' Tapestries\" Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin 72 No. 314 (November 1976), pp. 7\u201323. During two decades' involvement with the Beauvais tapestry workshops Boucher produced designs for six series of hangings in all, like the tapestry showing Psyche and the Basketmaker from 1741\u20131742. Boucher was also called upon for designs for court festivities organized by that section of the King's household called the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi and for the opera and for royal ch\u00e2teaux Versailles, Fontainebleau and Choisy. His designs for all of the aforementioned augmented his earlier reputation, resulting in many engravings from his work and even reproduction of his designs on porcelain and biscuit-ware at the Vincennes and S\u00e8vres factories. The death of Oudry in 1755 put an end to its contribution to Beauvais but his collaboration with the Gobelins lasted until 1765, when he stepped down from his position as an inspector. ==Drawings and prints== stump on paper Aurora, c. 1733, National Gallery of Art Boucher was a very prolific and varied draftsman. His drawings served not only as preparatory studies for his paintings and as designs for printmakers but also as finished works of art for which there was a great demand by collectors. Boucher followed standard studio practices of the time, by first working out the overall composition of his major canvases, and then making chalk studies for individual figures, or groups of figures. He also relied on oil and gouache sketches in the preparation of major commissions. Gradually he made more and more sketches as independent works for the market. The Adoration of the Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum of Art), a free and painterly sketch in gouache, was long considered a preparatory sketch for Madame de Pompadour's private altarpiece La lumi\u00e8re du monde (ca. 1750, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon). Recent scholarship suggests, however, that it was made at least 10 years later as an autonomous work. In the last decade of his career the artist began to favor brown chalk, a fabricated medium.Perrin Stein. Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703\u20131770) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2003. Boucher was also a gifted engraver and etcher. Boucher etched some 180 original copperplates. He made many etchings after Watteau. He thus helped propagate a taste for reproductions of drawings. When his own drawings began to sell, 266 of them were etched in stipple substitutes by Gilles Demarteau. These were printed in red ink so they resembled red chalk drawings which could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of luxury dwellings. Boucher's most original inventions were decorative, and he contributed to the fashionable style of chinoiserie, after having etched 12 'Figures Chinoises' (Chinese figures) by Watteau.Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589 ==Gallery== File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher 003.jpg|Self-portrait in the Studio, 1720, Louvre File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher - 'Putti with Birds'.jpg|Putti with Birds, c. 1730\u20131733, Honolulu Museum of Art File:Boucher renaud et armide louvre.jpg|Rinaldo and Armida, 1734 (Reception piece) File:Boucher Leda LACMA.jpeg|Leda and the Swan, 1741 File:Boucher Diane sortant du bain Louvre 2712.jpg|Diana Leaving the Bath, 1742 File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Sketch for a Portrait of Madame de Pompadour (1721 - 1764), c. 1750 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|In this sketch, Boucher allows the viewer to glimpse Madame de Pompadour before she goes out, c 1750, Waddesdon Manor File:Venus Consoling Love, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, 1751.jpg|Venus Consoling Love, 1751 File:The Toilet of Venus, by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.jpg|The Toilette of Venus (1751) typifies the pleasing elegance of Boucher's mature style.
