    "text": "The Entre R\u00edos Railway (ERR) (in Spanish: Ferrocarril Entre R\u00edos) was a British-owned railway company that built and operated a railway network in Entre R\u00edos Province, between the rivers Uruguay and Paran\u00e1, in Argentina. ==History== The company began operation in 1892 by purchasing a rail network operated by state-owned Central Entre R\u00edos from the provincial government. Four years later the company purchased the Gualeguay to Puerto Ruiz line, built by \"Ferrocarril Primer Entrerriano\" in 1866, from the national government, and on 12 October 1899 a branch line from Gobernador Sol\u00e1 to Mac\u00eda was opened. A line from Villaguay to Concordia, on the River Uruguay, was built in 1902 reaching Jubileo on 25 January, General Campos on 3 March and Concordia on 30 June where it joined the Argentine North Eastern Railway. Later the following branch lines were opened: from Las Colas to Enrique Carb\u00f3 on 10 October 1906, from Caseros to Villa Elisa on 28 December 1906, from Crespo to Hasenkamp on 26 August 1907, from M\u00e9danos to Carb\u00f3 on 1 February 1908, from M\u00e9danos to Ibicuy on 15 March 1908, from Ibucuy to the port in 1909, Carb\u00f3 to Parera on 1 December 1909 and Villa Elisa to San Salvador on 2 July 1912. In 1915 a joint administration was established with the neighbouring British-owned Argentine North Eastern Railway. By the time President Juan Per\u00f3n nationalised Argentina's railways in 1948 the ERR operated a 1,300 km network which became part of the state-owned General Urquiza Railway. == Heritage railway == In the early 1990s, a heritage railway was opened and operated by \"Ferroclub Central Entrerriano\", a local non-profit association formed by railway enthusiasts. Since then, the service has been running trains pulled by steam locomotives between the cities of Villa Elisa and Caseros in Entre R\u00edos Province, covering a distance of ,Tren tur\u00edstico de Villa Elisa on Girasol Hoster\u00eda with a total journey time of 120 minutes.\"15 trenes tur\u00edsticos de la Argentina\", Clar\u00edn, 24 May 2015 == See also == * General Urquiza Railway * Argentine North Eastern Railway == Bibliography == * British Railways in Argentina 1857-1914: A Case Study of Foreign Investment by Colin M.
