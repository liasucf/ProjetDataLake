    "text": "ScreenLimit was a time based content-control software for parents to control the time their children spend on devices. ==Working== Children can do assigned tasks like homework to earn more time. Multiple people can use the same or more devices in combination with their own time. They will get a warning when time runs out. When time runs out icons or the desktop will disappear and the ScreenLimit timer page will appear. Multiple schedules can be made like weekend/schoolday/vacation. An example of a schedule could be: Block at 22:00 (regardless of unspent time); Add 60 minutes (a day) at 00:01; UnBlock at 07:00. Parents can see realtime who is using what device. Parents can also manually (un)block a child. With one account multiple children and devices can be managed by multiple parents. ==History== ScreenLimit was first released in November 2016. ScreenLimit was closed on 22 January, 2019.[https://web.archive.org/web/20190124000639/https://www.screenlimit.net/ shut down 22nd January 2019 on screenlimit.net] ==Reviews== PC Advisor Full Review Educational App Store Teacher's ReviewEducational App Store - ScreenLimit Review == See also == *Comparison of content-control software and providers ==References== ==External links== * ScreenLimit - Official Website Category:Content-control software Category:Internet safety Category:Cross- platform software Category:iOS software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Windows software ",
