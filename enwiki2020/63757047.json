    "text": "Siddhartha Chib is a statistician and econometrician and Professor of Econometrics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis. His work is primarily in Bayesian statistics, econometrics, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Key papers include Albert and Chib (1993) , which introduced an approach for binary and categorical response models based on latent variables that simplifies the Bayesian analysis of categorical response models; Chib and Greenberg (1995) , which provided a derivation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from first principles, guidance on implementation and extensions to multiple-block versions; Chib (1995) and Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) , where a new method for calculating the marginal likelihood from the Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings output is developed; Carlin and Chib (1995), which developed a model-space jump method for Bayesian model choice via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods; Chib (1998) , which introduced a multiple-change point model that is estimated by the methods of Albert and Chib (1993) and Chib (1996) for hidden Markov processes; Kim, Shephard and Chib (1998), which introduced an efficient inference approach for univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models; and Chib and Greenberg (1998) , which developed the Bayesian analysis of the multivariate probit model. He has also written on Tobit censored responses , discretely observed diffusions , univariate and multivariate ARMA processes, multivariate count responses, causal inference, hierarchical models of longitudinal data, and, in Chib, Shin and Simoni (2018) , on the Bayesian analysis of moment condition models. ==Biography== He received a bachelor's degree from Delhi University in 1979. He earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1986. His advisor was Sreenivasa Rao Jammalamadaka. ==Honors and awards== He is a fellow of the American Statistical Association (2001), the International Society of Bayesian Analysis (2012), and the Journal of Econometrics. ==Selected publications== * Jim Albert, Siddhartha Chib. \"Bayesian Analysis of Binary and Polychotomous Response Data\".
