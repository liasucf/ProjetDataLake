    "text": "Max Everitt Rosenbloom (November 1, 1907According to Rosenbloom's headstone in the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, his birth date is November 1, 1907 \u2013 March 6, 1976) was an American professional boxer, actor, and television personality. Nicknamed \u201cSlapsie Maxie\u201d, he was inducted into The Ring's Boxing Hall of Fame in 1972, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1985, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993. ==Early life and boxing career== Born in Leonard Bridge, Connecticut, Rosenbloom was nicknamed \"Slapsie Maxie\" by a journalist due to his open-gloved style of boxing. As a professional boxer, Rosenbloom relied on hitting and moving to score points. He was very difficult to hit cleanly with a power punch and his fights often went the full number of required rounds. In his boxing career, he received thousands of punches to the head, which eventually led to the deterioration of his motor functions. Legendary trainer Cus D'Amato later recalled that watching Rosenbloom's ring performances inspired him for a quest to create a perfect fighter, and to develop a unique boxing technique, later known as the peek-a-boo style:Cus D'Amato - Philosopher's Mentality > Rosenbloom was probably the cleverest fighter I've ever seen, defensively. > You just couldn't hit the man. He developed a sort of a radar, a sense of > anticipation of blows, and ability to react to that, and act on it. In 1930, he won the New York light heavyweight title. In 1932, he won the World Light Heavyweight Championship. He held and defended the title until November 1934, when he lost it to Bob Olin. ==Films, radio and television== In 1937, two years before he announced his permanent retirement from boxing, Rosenbloom accepted a role in a Hollywood film. He became a character actor, usually portraying comical or sympathetic \"big guys\" in movies such Each Dawn I Die. He continued acting in films as well as on radio and television, where he again portrayed big, clumsy, often punch-drunk-but-lovable characters. He appeared as himself in a number of radio episodes of The Fred Allen Show, including in a skit with Marlene Dietrich. He was also cast in an important part in television's first 90-minute drama, Requiem for a Heavyweight. Written by Rod Serling and starring Jack Palance, that teleplay presents the story of a boxer at the end of his career. Rosenbloom portrays a character whose life revolves around his retelling old boxing stories night after night to other ex-boxers who gather in a down-and-out bar. That life looms as the same fate for \"Mountain\" McClintock (Palance's character) if he cannot adjust to a new way of life outside the ring. Slapsy Maxie's, Rosenbloom\u2019s nightclub, is prominently featured in a 2013 crime film, Gangster Squad, which is set in 1949. The original club operated in San Francisco. The club moved to 7165 Beverly Blvd in Los Angeles. From 1943-47 it was located at 5665 Wilshire Blvd.Foster, Charles (2003). Once Upon a Time in Paradise: Canadians in the Golden Age of Hollywood.
