The yellow-green leaves are slightly triangular in cross-section. They are small (8 x 4mm) and fused at the base (connate). The young flowers have erect stamens and stamenodes forming a central cone. The petals each have a central line. There are four lobes around the flower base. The fruit capsule is also 4-locular. It is 8mm wide and crumbles soon after releasing the seeds. The stalks (pedicels) are brown and darker coloured towards their bases. They are thickest midway along and thinnest near the top. Like many other Drosanthemum species, the pedicel has a layer of cork within it, especially near the base.Vlok, J. and Schutte-Vlok, A.L. (2010). Plants of the Klein Karoo.
