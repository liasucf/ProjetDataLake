    "text": "The Castle of Cocentaina, located in the municipality of Cocentaina, Alicante, Spain, is a 14th-century medieval building which stands on a rocky mound of 765 m. The castle structure, recently restored, is one of the town's symbols. The tower is a square two-story structure. On the first floor there is an open patio with a well, a chapel and a warehouse. On the upper floor, where the lords lived, there is a cornice with battlements and a path for guards. The castle is a good example of military gothic style. == Bibliography == *Gu\u00eda de Arquitectura de la Provincia de Alicante. *PAREDES VA\u00d1\u00d3, Enric (2011), \"Aproximaci\u00f3n a la arquitectura de las fortificaciones en las monta\u00f1as del valle central del Serpis.
