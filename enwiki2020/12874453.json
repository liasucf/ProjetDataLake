WRJR is owned and operated by Iglesia Nueva Vida of High Point. 670 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency on which WSCR in Chicago, Illinois and KDLG in Dillingham, Alaska share Class A status. WRJR must reduce power from sunset to sunrise to prevent interference to the nighttime skywave signals of the Class A stations. ==Call sign== The WRJR call sign was previously on Portsmouth based AM1010, now WPMH. ==Transmission== WRJR's tower is located near Surry, Virginia, which allows the station's daytime signal to cover all of Hampton Roads, but with its extremely low nighttime power, the station essentially broadcasts to only Surry proper at night. 670 AM is United States clear-channel frequency on which WSCR in Chicago, Illinois is the dominant Class A station. WRJR reduces nighttime power to avoid interfering with WSCR's nighttime skywave signal. ==Format change== On October 3, 2011, WRJR switched from its simulcast of sister WPMH to a Black Gospel format as \"Paradise Broadcasting Network\". ==References== ==External links== RJR Category:Radio stations established in 1989 RJR ",
