Many of them were, or became, priests. Although much of their work is too early to be mentioned here it did survive into the early Baroque. Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina is generally seen as the most famous member. As a list of members is in the article on the subject, repetition of names in it should be normally avoided, although Palestrina is notable enough to be in both. ===21st Century Classical School=== There is a small but growing school of church composers, favoring a return to Catholic music that can be called \"classical\", writing original organ, choral, and vocal music that is often based on Gregorian chant. ==Twentieth century and contemporary music== ===Popular composers and artists=== Contemporary Catholic music takes many forms, from modern hymnody to inculturated sacred works. The genre of modern Catholic music is continuing to grow. Modern Catholic musicians tend toward two main forms of expression: liturgical and non- liturgical. In a liturgical context, music is performed in a manner intended to heighten the spiritual atmosphere of a liturgical service, such as during Sunday Mass, Eucharistic adoration or Stations of the Cross, and is mandated to follow the musical tradition and decrees of the Church, such as those found in Musical Sacra and Tra le Sollecitudini for the Latin rite. The non- liturgical context, though very much worshipful, usually takes the form of a concert or gathering without the presence of a liturgical service and outside of the Mass. Non-liturgical settings are mainly focused on building Christian fellowship within Catholic communities. Non-liturgical artists find the opportunity to uniquely share their faith through their personal lyrics, and directly to audiences between songs, and these gatherings, since they are not a rite of the Church, but a form of personal and popular devotion, are free from the liturgical requirements that accompany a solemn act of worship in a liturgy. Although Catholic musicians tend toward one expression over the other, many will minister within both expressions with the appropriate music styles for each. The following popular composers and performers are of note: ====Liturgical artists==== * Domenico Bartolucci - Catholic Cardinal who composed \"Misa Jubilei,\" while he was still a priest and has other religious compositions. * Devan and Ruth Bond - liturgical composers whose latest collection of 24 seasonal psalms written with verbatim text won the Music Director's Choice award and the Catholic Liturgy People's award for best new psalm settings.
