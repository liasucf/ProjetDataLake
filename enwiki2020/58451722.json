    "text": "Christian Krattenthaler Christian Friedrich Krattenthaler (born 8 October 1958 in Vienna) is an Austrian mathematician. He is a professor of discrete mathematics (with a focus on combinatorics) and the Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Vienna. He received his doctoral degree sub auspiciis Praesidentis rei publicae at the University of Vienna in 1983 under Johann Cigler with the dissertation Lagrangeformel und inverse Relationen (Lagrangian formula and inverse relations). Krattenthaler worked at various universities, including the University of California, San Diego, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, the University of Strasbourg, and the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 before being appointed to a professorship at the University of Vienna. His area of specialization is the problems of combinatorial enumeration, such as those in algebra, algebraic geometry, number theory, computer science, or statistical physics.Christian Krattenthaler's home pageChristian Krattenthaler, Wittgensteinpreis Tr\u00e4gerInnen Club, Internet Wayback Machine Krattenthaler won in 1990 the Prize of the Austrian Mathematical Society and in 2007 the Wittgenstein Award of the Austrian Science Fund. He was elected in 2005 a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in 2011 a full member of the Academia Europaea, and in 2012 a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Krattenthaler is also a trained concert pianist, but had to abandon his musical career because of repetitive strain injury in his hands.http://www.mdw.ac.at/?pageid=508 ==References== ==External links== * * * (2016 International Conference of Number Theory in honor of Krishna Alladi's 60th birthday) Category:Austrian mathematicians Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:University of Vienna faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Members of the Austrian Academy of Sciences Category:Members of Academia Europaea Category:1958 births Category:Living people ",
