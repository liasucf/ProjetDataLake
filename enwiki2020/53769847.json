    "text": "The Archbishop's Palace of Salvador (, also Pal\u00e1cio do Arcebispado de Salvador, Pal\u00e1cio Arquiepiscopal da S\u00e9) is a Roman Catholic residence in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. It is located on the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 in the Pelourinho historical district of the city. The palace was built in the early eighteenth century and is one of the best examples of Portuguese colonial-period civil architecture in Brazil. The Archbishop's Palace was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1938. IPHAN transferred ownership of the palace to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia in 2011. The palace sits within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Historic Center of Salvador. Part of the structure was converted into a cultural center, the Cultural Center of the Pal\u00e1cio da S\u00e9, which opened in 2020. ==History== Baroque-style portal of the palace with the coat of arms of Archbishop Sebasti\u00e3o Monteiro da Vide (1643-1722) at center of the pediment The Archbishop's Palace dates to the early 18th century, when a royal charter authorized the construction of a residence for the archbishop in the Terreiro de Jesus. Sebasti\u00e3o Monteiro da Vide (1643-1722) arrived in Bahia on May 22, 1702, and held the office of archbishop until his death. His petition for the construction of a residence was authorized by the Queen Regent on March 13, 1705. A site adjacent to the S\u00e9 Cathedral was chosen in 1707 on the site of a hermitage of the Brotherhood of Saint Peter of the Clergy. The building was completed in 1715. The palace fell into disrepair and disuse in the 20th century after the demolition of the former S\u00e9 Cathedral. The National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) took ownership of the building in 1938. Ownership of the palace was passed to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia in March 2011, which then negotiated with the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute on the future use of the structure. ==Structure== The art historian Germain Bazin described the palace as a \"great cube of masonry decorated with an elegant door.\" The structure consists of three stories at street level above a basement. It has a main fa\u00e7ade with three floors. The entrance is marked by a portal in Lioz stone decorated with a coat of arms flanked by stylized scrolls. The coat of arms is that of Sebasti\u00e3o Monteiro da Vide, archbishop of Salvador at the time of the construction of the building. The fa\u00e7ade of the palace has an elaborate Baroque-style portal of Portuguese marble with an elaborate pediment. It has at its center the coat of arms of Dom Sebasti\u00e3o Monteiro da Vide with volutes at the left and right. The windows of the first two floors are relatively simple and those on the third floor higher and flanked by balconies and iron grille balconets. The interior of the palace is arranged around a central courtyard, a late example of those found in Italian palazzi. The courtyard provided both light and air to the interior of the building. Similar examples in Bahia can be found in Solar Berqu\u00f3, Solar Boa Vista, Casa das Sete Mortes; and the plantation houses of Freguesia and Matoim, the latter now demolished. Demolition of the S\u00e9 Cathedral altered the appearance of the palace. It exposed raised walkways between the two buildings and the broad, lateral fa\u00e7ade of the palace. The site of the demolished church, next to the palace, is now a square, the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9. ==Cultural Center of the Pal\u00e1cio da S\u00e9== The Cultural Center of the Pal\u00e1cio da S\u00e9 () has a permanent exhibit on the first floor called \"The Church and the Formation of Brazil\" (), which consists of historical artifacts owned by the Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador. Remnants of the former S\u00e9 Cathedral form an important part of the collection. The first floor of the building also houses the Reitor Eug\u00eanio Veiga Conservation and Restaurantion Laboratory. The second floor of the cultural center has additional artifacts owned by the Archdiocese. The cultural center occupies only part of the building; the remainder is retained by the Archdiocese for administrative and religious use. ==Protected status== The Archbishop's Palace was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) on June 17, 1938. IPHAN took ownership of the palace in the same year. ==See also== *Catholic Church in Brazil ==References== Category:Episcopal palaces Category:Historic Center (Salvador) Category:Buildings and structures in Salvador, Bahia Category:Palaces in Brazil Category:National heritage sites of Bahia Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in Brazil Category:1715 establishments in the Portuguese Empire ",
