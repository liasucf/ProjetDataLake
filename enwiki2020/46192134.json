    "text": "The 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Wisconsin were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 to elect the eight U.S. Representatives from the state of Wisconsin, one from each of the state's eight congressional districts. The elections coincided with the elections of other federal and state offices, including President of the United States and U.S. Senator from Wisconsin. The primaries were held on August 9. ==District 1== Republican Paul Ryan had represented the district since being elected in 1998. From October 29, 2015 until his retirement in 2019 he sat as the Speaker of the House. ===Republican primary=== ;Declared * Paul Ryan, incumbent * Paul Nehlen, senior vice-president of operations at Neptune-BensonTatge-Rozell, Jill. \"Delavan businessman to challenge Ryan\". Kenosha News. March 31, 2016. ====Campaign==== Nehlen filed campaign papers to run against Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on April 1, 2016, and officially launched his campaign on April 14, with the opening of his first campaign office in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Nehlen claims to have been a Paul Ryan supporter and worked for his election in earlier campaigns but at least one conservative media report has questioned that claim. Nehlen indicated he decided to run against Ryan in 2016 because he felt betrayed by Ryan's positions on immigration and the Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty. He accused Ryan of \"cronyism and corruption\". According to a Janesville Gazette report about his campaign launch, \"Nehlen declined to talk about issues such as abortion and would not say what presidential candidate he supports or whether he would support a Republican running for the presidency.\" Nehlen ran on a platform calling for secure borders, enforcement of existing immigration laws, and reduced government spending, and he opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty. On May 5, 2016, Nehlen pledged to support Donald Trump for the presidency. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on July 14, 2016, that Nehlen had hired Dan Backer as his campaign treasurer. Backer is nationally known for his fundraising activities. In an August 2016 radio interview, Nehlen suggested that the United States should \"have a discussion\" about the possibility of deporting Sharia-adherent Muslims living in the country. The remark occurred when Nehlen was asked about his thoughts regarding the dispute between 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Humayun Khan, an American Muslim Army captain who died in a suicide bombing while serving in Iraq in 2004. During the interview, Nehlen also said that every mosque in the United States should be monitored for signs of potential radicalization. Because of Nehlen's support for Trump, Trump publicly thanked him on Twitter and later told The Washington Post that Nehlen was \"running a very good campaign\", even though he did not endorse him. On August 5, 2016, Trump endorsed Ryan's re-election after pressure from fellow Republican leaders. Nehlen lost the Republican Party primary to Ryan.\"House Speaker Ryan cruises to victory in GOP primary\". Fox News. August 9, 2016.
