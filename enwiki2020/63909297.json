    "text": "The Vampire Diaries Universe is an American media franchise and a shared universe that is centered on various interconnected television series airing on The CW. The series were developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec, and based on characters who appeared in the original novel series, The Vampire Diaries, by L. J. Smith. ==Television series== ===The Vampire Diaries (2009\u20132017)=== The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement in the late 18th century. It follows the life of Elena Gilbert, a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident, as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore. Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore returns, with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev), a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. ===The Originals (2013\u20132018)=== The spinoff centers on three of the Mikaelson siblings: Klaus, Elijah, and Rebekah. The Mikaelson family are also commonly known as \"the Originals\" due to the fact that they are the first vampires in history. The series begins with the Original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919, where a pregnant Hayley Marshall has also settled. In their absence, Klaus's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Marcel, took charge of the French Quarter. Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. ===Legacies (2018\u2013present)=== The new series follows Hope Mikaelson, the daughter of Klaus and Hayley Marshall, who is descended from some of the most powerful vampire, werewolf, and witch bloodlines. Two years after the events of The Originals, 17-year-old Hope attends the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted. The school provides a haven where supernatural beings can learn to control their abilities and impulses. The initial cast of Legacies from left to right: Matthew Davis, Quincy Fouse, Peyton Alex Smith, Danielle Rose Russel, Kaylee Bryant, Jenny Boyd, and Aria Shahghasemi ==Development== Initially, Kevin Williamson had little interest in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to Stephenie Meyer's successful novels, Twilight. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the books. He started to become intrigued by the story: \"I began to realize that it was a story about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface.\" Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school. On February 6, 2009, Variety announced that The CW had green-lit the pilot for The Vampire Diaries with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head writers and executive producers. On May 19, 2009, the series was officially ordered for the 2009\u20132010 season. The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. However, the rest of the seasons have been filmed in Covington, Georgia (which doubles as the show's fictional small town of Mystic Falls, Virginia) and various other communities around Greater Atlanta to take advantage of local tax incentives. On the morning of May 10, 2012, a fire broke out in the building on Clark Street in Covington that was used as the setting for Mystic Grill on the show. The series was given a full 22-episode order on October 21, 2009, after strong ratings for the first half of the season. Now there is a spin-off called The Originals, that goes into depth about the original vampire family from The Vampire Diaries. On February 16, 2010, The CW announced that it had renewed the show for a second season, which premiered on September 9, 2010.\"The CW Network announces fall premiere dates\" . The CW. Retrieved August 19, 2010. Early in production, producers tried to get Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played Buffy on the popular supernatural drama series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to guest-star on the second season in the role of Rose; however, Gellar declined the role. On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a third season. The third season premiered on September 15, 2011. Former president of entertainment at The CW, Dawn Ostroff, mentioned a spin-off idea in 2010 that she said could happen in a few years.\"CW President teases The Vampire Diaries spin-off\". TVFanatic.com. Retrieved October 9, 2010. A spin-off was in development for the 2011 fall line-up, but due to Kevin Williamson's commitment to The Secret Circle, it was put on hold indefinitely. The fourth season premiered on October 11, 2012. The CW renewed the show for a fifth season on February 11, 2013. On April 26, 2013, The CW announced that The Originals had been ordered to the series premiere in the 2013\u201314 television season. The Originals premiered on October 3, 2013. Daniel Gillies as Elijah, Claire Holt as Rebekah, and Phoebe Tonkin as Hayley continued to play their characters, originally from The Vampire Diaries, in the new spin-off series. The Originals is about the Mikaelson siblings, who are the original family of vampires, and their take-over of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The show also involves Hayley and Klaus's daughter, Hope. Producers reported that there would be a transition of the characters in both series. Claire Holt made a special cameo in The Vampire Diaries, in the episodes \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and \"500 Years of Solitude\". Michael Trevino made a special cameo on episodes of The Originals, \"Bloodletting\" and \"The River In Reverse.\" Joseph Morgan, Daniel Gillies, and Claire Holt returned to The Vampire Diaries in a special cameo on the series' 100th episode \"500 Years of Solitude\". Nina Dobrev also appeared in the fifth episode of The Originals second season, \"Red Door,\" as Tatia. At the Television Critics Association winter 2016 press tour, CW president Mark Pedowitz announced an official crossover between The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, where Stefan goes on the run and finds a haven in New Orleans where he runs into Klaus. In November 2014, a web series titled The Originals: The Awakening was released as the third show in the franchise. The series explores the character Kol Mikaelson and his relationships with his siblings. Flashing back to 1914, Kol is on a quest to ally with the witches of the French Quarter. Awakening gives answers to some questions about Kol's past, including the origins of his rivalry with his family and the unique backstory he has with the New Orleans witches. Each webisode is approximately two minutes long. The series concluded on December 8, 2014. To date, The Originals: The Awakening is the only web series in The Vampire Diaries universe. President of The CW, Mark Pedowitz, said in an interview at the summer TCA's that The Vampire Diaries didn't receive an extra episode order for the second season at the request of Kevin Williamson. Kevin Williamson felt to do the best show possible; he would rather do 22 episodes. \"I'd rather have a great 22 than a good 24 if Kevin couldn't do it,\" he explained. The writers first met for the fifth season on April 15, 2013. Filming began on July 10, 2013, and finished on April 10, 2014. On July 23, 2016, it was announced that the show would end after a 16-episode eighth season. In August 2017, it was announced that early discussions on the development of a spinoff of The Originals focusing on Hope Mikaelson, the daughter of Klaus Mikaelson and Hayley Marshall, were taking place with Julie Plec, creator of The Originals and co-creator of The Vampire Diaries. In January 2018, it was revealed that a pilot for the spinoff had been ordered; Plec penned the pilot script and is credited with creating the series. It was announced in March 2018 that the spinoff had been ordered to pilot, but instead of a traditional pilot, a fifteen-minute pilot presentation of the series would be presented to The CW. On May 11, 2018, it was announced that the spinoff, titled Legacies, had been ordered to series for the 2018\u201319 U.S. television season. In June 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on October 25, 2018. On October 8, 2018, The CW announced that they had ordered three additional scripts for the series, bringing the first season total script order to sixteen episodes. On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a second season. The second season premiered on October 10, 2019. On January 7, 2020, the series was renewed for a third season. ==Web series== ===The Vampire Diaries: A Darker Truth (2009)=== A promotional web series that follows Jason Harris investigating the strange death of his sister, Jordan Harris. ===The Originals: The Awakening (2014)=== The series explores the character Kol Mikaelson and his relationships with his siblings.
