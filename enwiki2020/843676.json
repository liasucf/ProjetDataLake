    "text": "Steve Young (July 12, 1942 \u2013 March 17, 2016) was an American country music singer, songwriter and guitarist, known for his song \"Seven Bridges Road\" (on Rock Salt & Nails & Seven Bridges Road). He was a pioneer of the country rock, Americana, and alternative country sounds, and also a vital force behind the \"outlaw movement\" that gave support to the careers of Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams, Jr. and more. Young was also featured in the 1975 Outlaw Country documentary Heartworn Highways. He was the subject of the song \"The All Golden\" by Van Dyke Parks. Young's first album, Rock Salt & Nails, on A&M;, featured Gram Parsons, Gene Clark, and other musicians from the 1969 musical community in Southern California. ==Biography== Born in Newnan, Georgia, he grew up in Gadsden, Alabama, and the state of Texas, moving from place to place as his family searched for work. By the time he had completed high school, Young was playing and writing songs that incorporated influences of folk, blues, country and gospel that he absorbed while travelling throughout the South. In the late 60s he worked with Van Dyke Parks and was member of the psychedelic country band Stone Country. Young wrote many songs, including \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean\" (covered by Waylon Jennings) and \"Montgomery In the Rain\" (covered by Hank Williams, Jr.). During the late 1970s, Young became a Buddhist and a vegetarian. https://americansongwriter.com/behind-the-song- seven-bridges-road-written-by-steve-young/david-freeland/ His best-known composition is \"Seven Bridges Road\", which became a hit for Eagles when they included a cover of it on their live album in 1980. Earlier covers of the song were done by Joan Baez, Tracy Nelson & Mother Earth, Iain Matthews, Dolly Parton, and Rita Coolidge. In 1984, Young charted the single \"It's Not Supposed to Be That Way\" on RCA Records. It peaked at No. 84 on Hot Country Songs. In 1989, Young did a mini tour in the Northwest with singer-songwriter Tim Otto, performing in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.
