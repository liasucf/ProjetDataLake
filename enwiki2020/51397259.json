    "text": "Accidental Sky is an album by experimental music group White Out with guitarist Nels Cline which was released in October 2015 on the Northern Spy label.Northern Spy Records album entry , accessed August 22, 2016 ==Reception== Pitchfork's Raymond Cummings rated the album 6.9 out of 10, saying, \"What\u2019s most frustrating isn\u2019t ultimately that Sky doesn\u2019t make it beyond the stratosphere, but that some of these songs should go on longer; they need more space to stretch, breathe, expand into stranger, deeper realms\". Relix correspondent Jesse Jarnow noted: \"keyboardist Lin Culbertson and drummer Tom Surgal provide a lush and constantly shifting bed for Cline\u2019s sweet Tom Verlaine/Duane Allman-y volume swells. On the album\u2019s best pieces, the trio achieves three-dimensionality, percussion and keyboards and guitar melting in and out of one another to form abstruse landscapes with dancing horizons\".Jarnow, J.
