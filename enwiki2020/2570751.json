In 1958-61, he co-edited the underground literary journals Sintaksis and Boomerang, and helped compile the samizdat poetry anthology Phoenix. In 1961, Kuznetsov was arrested and tried for the first time for his involvement in publishing samizdat, and for making overtly political speeches in poetry readings at Mayakovsky Square in central Moscow. Among those also attending these informal gatherings were Yuri Galanskov, Vladimir Osipov and, the youngest of all, Vladimir Bukovsky. Kuznetsov was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. ==The Leningrad plane hijackers case== Following his release in 1968, Kuznetsov became one of the organizers of the Leningrad plane hijackers or Dymshits\u2013Kuznetsov hijacking affair in June 1970. Arrested for \"high treason,\" he faced the death sentence but after lodging an appeal and international protests against his execution his sentence was replaced with fifteen years in prison and labour camp.See Chronicle of Current Events, issue 17.
