    "text": "\"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her eponymous debut studio album (2017). The song was written by Lipa alongside Lauren Christy and its producer Jon Levine. The song was released for digital download and streaming through Warner Bros. Records on 26 August 2016 as the fifth single from the album, and impacted contemporary hit radio as Lipa's first single in the United States. It is an alt pop, electropop, and nu-disco song with dark moombahton and chambr\u00e9 tropical house elements. The production includes tropical beats, indietronica vocals and sawtooth synths. Lyrically, the song is about being comfortable in one's own skin. \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Lipa's attitude and the song's message. Commercially, it gave Lipa her second entry on the UK Singles Chart, where it reached number 30, and her first US Billboard Hot 100 entry by reaching number 72. The song also reached number 23 on the US Mainstream Top 40 chart and the summit of Billboards Dance Club Songs chart. It was certified gold and platinum in the US and the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. The music video for \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" was directed by Kinga Burza and released on 12 September 2016. It was filmed in London's Barbican Centre, and features Lipa and her girl gang posing in the area, as well as walking around. According to Lipa, the video is a campaign for niceness. Lipa further promoted the song in 2016 with live performances for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, the Gouden Televizier-Ring Gala, and Today. The song received several remixes, including ones by Alex Metric and Karma Kid, as well as an acoustic version. ==Background and release== Lipa co-wrote \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" with Jon Levine and Lauren Christy, with Levine solely handling the production. They wrote it in Los Angeles in February 2016. After working as a model, Lipa was inspired for the song after being told that she needs to lose weight in order to be successful as a model. The collaborators decided to write about being comfortable in one's own skin. The song was recorded at The Synagogue in Los Angeles, while the vocals were recorded at TaP / Strongroom 7 in London. Lipa announced the release of \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" on 24 August 2016. It was released for digital download and streaming two days later as the fifth single from Dua Lipa, along with the pre-order of the album. The song was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the United States on 20 September 2016 as Lipa's first single in the country. The song was released via the same radio format in both the United Kingdom and Italy on 9 and 2 September of that year, respectively. It was later included as the sixth track on Dua Lipa, released on 2 June 2017. An acoustic version and an EP, with remixes by Alex Metric, Karma Kid, Night Moves, and Black Saint were also released. The acoustic version was released simultaneously with the song's release and the EP was released on 21 October 2016. The acoustic version includes a piano line and handclaps. ==Music and lyrics== \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" is an Alt pop, electropop, and nu-disco song, with tropical beats alongside dark moombahton and chambr\u00e9 tropical house elements. The song is composed in time and the key of D minor, with a moderate groove tempo of 109 beats per minute and a chord progression of B\u2013Gm\u2013Dm\u2013Csus. Lipa's vocals were categorized as indietronica and range from A3 to C5. Idolator's Rachel Sonis described the lyrics as \"having the upper hand in a relationship,\" while Sebas E. Alonso of Jenesaispop stated they are about \"sending someone to hell, a fuck you to anyone who wants to change you.\" The song begins slowly, with indie beats, ethereal synths, and echoing tribal drums. The first verse has empowerment themes and sees Lipa being secure with herself, even though at one time she was not. In the pre-chorus, Lipa sings about her desire to pursue music and how people told her she was crazy for it, as well as commenting that people think she has changed but her aspirations have only gotten bigger. The chorus has bubblegum pop and k-pop sawtooth synths, electro beats and synth-bass hits. Vocally, Lipa blows a kiss at the end of the chorus and half-talks the post-chorus. Lipa describes the chorus as being \"in the heat of an argument,\" lyrically asking someone why they keep coming back to her if they dislike her aspirations and who she is. She eventually states that the person will love her blind, meaning that they have chosen Lipa because they would not want her any other way. The post-chorus sees Lipa wanting to live her life, not needing money or superficial stuff. In the second verse, Lipa addresses the lover, showing that they enjoy the arguments. ==Critical reception== \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Anna Gaca of Spin called the song \"a short, bombastic number\" with \"equal parts club-ready sultriness.\" Sonis labeled it \"feisty\" and said that \"it's playful, bubbly, and a perfect number to serve as her first official single in the US.\" She went on to state that the song \"oozes confidence\" and categorized the beat as \"pulsing\" and \"infectious.\" Mike Nied, also of Idolator, labelled the song a \"flirty bop with a playful message.\" For The Young Folks, Manzanares de la Rosa stated it \"remains the most exciting three minutes\" in Lipa's career as well as calling the song \"an irresistible [smash] performed with the sass and the confidence of a long-standing diva.\" Ben Hogwood of musicOMH viewed \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" as \"a confident declaration of intent\" and \"outright feminine power,\" but criticized Lipa blowing a kiss in the style of Holly Valance, stating the song \"spoils itself\" with that aspect. However, Ra\u00fal Guill\u00e9n of Jenesaispop enjoyed the kiss, writing that it is \"one of those silly details that you cannot later get out of your head\" and called the chorus as a whole one of her \"most effective.\" The same website later named it the 73rd best song of 2016, praising the combination of a \"forceful\" bass and vocal performance as well as calling the chorus \"casual and fresh,\" while concluding by stating the song is \"frankly irresistible.\" In The Line of Best Fit, Claire Biddles categorized the song's aesthetic as \"high-heeled in a club\" and called it \"the most enticing moments in recent pop.\" Of the same magazine, Laurence Day stated \"it's fizzing with youthful energy and oozes cheeky joy from every refrain.\" The staff of Billboard called the song \"cheeky\" and stated that it \"impressively showcases her attitude and nuanced voice.\" In Renowned for Sound, Rachael Scarsbrook compared the song to Carly Rae Jepsen and wrote that it \"gets people going.\" She concluded by stating, \"[t]here isn't one negative way this track could be perceived.\" Ryan Cole of Vocal Media called the song \"a lot of fun\" and compared it to the works of Charli XCX. For The Guardian, Hannah J Davies called \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" \"unapologetically in-your-face\" as well as \"strong and stylish.\" Alim Kheraj of DIY viewed the song as \"flirtatious,\" but criticized the lack of longevity, writing that it is \"still immensely enjoyable, although over time [it's] lost some of [its] glittery sheen.\" Rick Pearson from Evening Standard criticized the song, calling it \"irritating in the extreme.\" \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" won Performance of the Year by an International Artist at the Wish 107.5 Music Awards. ==Commercial performance== \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" debuted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart issue dated 2 September 2016, becoming Lipa's second entry on the chart, following \"Hotter than Hell\" (2016).
