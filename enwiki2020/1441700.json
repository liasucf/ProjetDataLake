    "text": "The Lakes of Killarney are a scenic attraction located in Killarney National Park near Killarney, County Kerry, in Ireland. They consist of three lakes - Lough Leane, Muckross Lake (also called Middle Lake) and Upper Lake. == Surroundings == The lakes sit in a low valley some above sea level. They are surrounded by the rugged slopes of MacGillycuddy's Reeks. Notable mountains in the range include Carrauntoohil, which, at is Ireland's highest mountain, Purple Mountain, at , Mangerton Mountain, at , and Torc Mountain, at . The N71 road from Killarney to Kenmare passes a viewpoint called Ladies View which offers a view of the lakes and valleys. On the occasion of Queen Victoria's visit in 1861, the point was apparently chosen by the queen's ladies-in- waiting as the finest in the land; hence the name. == Lough Leane == alt= Lough Leane () is the largest and northernmost of the three lakes, approximately in size. It is also the largest body of fresh water in the region. The River Laune drains Lough Leane to the north-west towards Killorglin and into Dingle Bay. Leane is dotted with small forested islands, including Innisfallen Island, which holds the remains of the ruined Innisfallen Abbey. On the eastern edge of the lake, Ross Island, more properly a peninsula, was the site of some of the earliest Copper Age metalwork in prehistoric Ireland.p142-146, Richard Bradley The prehistory of Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, 2007, Ross Castle, a 15th-century keep, sits on the eastern shore of the lake, north of the Ross Island peninsula. == Muckross Lake == alt= Also known as Middle Lake or Torc Lake, Muckross is just south of Lough Leane. The two are separated by a small peninsula, crossed by a stone arched bridge called Brickeen Bridge. It is Ireland's deepest lake, reaching to in parts. A paved hiking trail of approximately circles the lake. == Upper Lake == alt= The Upper Lake is the smallest of the three lakes, and the southernmost. It is separated from the others by a winding channel some long. ==Gallery== File:Ross Castle across the Lakes of Killarney.JPG|Ross Castle visible across Lough Leane File:Killarney Lakes november.jpg|View near Ross Castle File:Killarney lake.jpg|Brickeen Bridge, where Lough Leane and Muckross Lake meet File:Lakes of Killarney.JPG|The lakes as viewed from Ladies View File:Ladies view bij Killarney.jpg|Another view from the Ladies View point File:DV405 no.243 Map of the Lakes of Killarney.png|Hand-drawn map of the Lakes by French artist Alphonse Dousseau, between 1830-1869 File:\"Lake surrounded by mountains in an unknown location\" (is lakes of Killarney) (26040083492).jpg|Photograph of Upper Lake by Fergus O\u2019Connor circa 1920 with commotion in bottom right ==See also== * List of loughs of Ireland == References == ==External links== * Killarney National Park * National Library of Ireland archives for the lakes * Ross Island Category:Killarney Killarney Category:Ruins in the Republic of Ireland ",
