    "text": "President Barack Obama at an NSC Meeting in the Situation Room. Participants include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NSC Advisor Gen. James \"Jim\" Jones, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dennis Blair, Deputy National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, White House Counsel Greg Craig, CIA Director Leon Panetta, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright, and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel Ronald Reagan's National Security Council. Participants include George Shultz, William F. Martin, Cap Weinberger, Colin Powell and Howard Baker. The White House National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum used by the President of the United States for consideration of national security, military, and foreign policy matters with senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials and is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Since its inception under Harry S. Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the President on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the President's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations. ==History== The immediate predecessor to the National Security Council was the National Intelligence Authority (NIA), which was established by President Harry S. Truman's Executive Letter of January 22, 1946, to oversee the Central Intelligence Group, the CIA's predecessor. The NIA was composed of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief. The National Security Council was created in 1947 by the National Security Act. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the Soviet Union, in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.Encyclopedia of American foreign policy, 2nd ed. Vol. 2, New York: Scribner, 2002, National Security Council, 22 April 2009 The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and other instruments of national security policy such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also created in the National Security Act. In 2004, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, taking over the responsibilities previously held by the head of CIA, the Director of Central Intelligence, as a cabinet- level position to oversee and coordinate activities of the Intelligence Community.Directors of Central Intelligence as Leaders of the US Intelligence Community, Douglas F. Garthoff, 2007, cia.gov On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama merged the White House staff supporting the Homeland Security Council (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the President. The name of the staff organization was changed back to National Security Council Staff in 2014. On January 29, 2017, President Donald Trump restructured the Principals Committee (a subset of the full National Security Council), while at the same time altering the attendance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence. According to National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence were to sit on the Principals Committee as and when matters pertaining to them arise, but will remain part of the full National Security Council. However, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus clarified the next day that they still are invited to attend meetings. With National Security Presidential Memorandum 4 in April 2017, the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \"shall\" attend Principals Committee meetings and included the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency as a regular attendee. Lawfare Blog NSPM-4: \"Organization of the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Subcommittees\": A Summary The reorganization also placed the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development as a permanent member of the Deputies Committee, winning moderate praise, while the White House Chief Strategist was removed. ===Detailed history=== For a detailed history of the United States National Security Council by year see: * 1947\u20131953 * 1953\u20131961 * 1961\u20131963 * 1963\u20131969 * 1969\u20131974 * 1974\u20131977 * 1977\u20131981 * 1981\u20131989 * 1989\u20131993 * 1993\u2013present ==Authority and powers== The National Security Council was established by the National Security Act of 1947 (PL 235 \u2013 61 Stat. 496; U.S.C. 402), amended by the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 579; 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). Later in 1949, as part of the Reorganization Plan, the Council was placed in the Executive Office of the President. The High Value Detainee Interrogation Group also reports to the NSC. ===Kill authorizations=== A secret National Security Council panel pursues the killing of an individual, including American citizens, who has been called a suspected terrorist. In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available. The panel's actions are justified by \"two principal legal theories\": They \"were permitted by Congress when it authorized the use of military forces against militants in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001; and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself.\" Homeland Security Advisor John O. Brennan, who has helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the Disposition Matrix database, has described the Obama Administration targeted killing policy by stating that \"in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes\". Reuters has reported that Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly. On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice memo providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa'ida or associated forces. ==Membership== The Trump Administration's National Security Council, as per the statute and National Security Presidential Memorandum\u20134, is chaired by the President.

Policy Coordination Committees are chaired by Senior Directors on the National Security Council staff, or sometimes National Economic Council staff, with Assistant Secretary-level officials from the relevant executive department or agency acting as co-chairs. ===Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense=== The Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense, created by Barack Obama in 2016 in response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, was responsible \"to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.\"Cameron, Beth, \"I ran the White House pandemic office. Trump closed it\", Washington Post op-ed, March 13, 2020. Retrieved 2020-03-17. The directorate was disbanded when a May 2018 change in organizational structure by John Bolton, Trump's recently appointed head of the National Security Council, resulted in the effective elimination of the office then led by Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, Sr. Director for Global Health Security and Biothreats. Remaining staff were moved to other NSC departments, prompting Ziemer's resignation, thus completing the elimination of the office.Sun, Lena H., \"Top White House official in charge of pandemic response exits abruptly\", Washington Post, May 10, 2018. Retrieved 2020-03-17. The responsibilities that formerly belonged to the directorate, along with those of arms control and nonproliferation, and of weapons of mass destruction terrorism, were absorbed into a single new directorate, counterproliferation and biodefense, and assigned to Tim Morrison in July 2018 as director. Morrison characterized the consolidation as part of an overall NSC \"reduction of force\" and called it \"specious\" to say the office was \"dissolved,\" describing the previous size of the organization as \"bloat,\" and stating \"That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017.\"Morrison, Tim, \"No, the White House didn't 'dissolve' its pandemic response office. I was there\", Washington Post op-ed, March 16, 2020. Retrieved 2020-03-17.Kessler, Glenn and Kelly, Meg. (20 March 2020). \"Was the White House office for global pandemics eliminated?\". Washington Post website Retrieved 20 March 2020. Trump defended the 2018 cuts, describing the financial motivation, when questioned in a Feb 2020 press conference, suggesting that people on a pandemic response team are unnecessary between pandemics, saying \"Some of the people we cut, they haven't been used for many, many years.\" No source of information could be found to support the president's statement, likely because the team was created in 2016 and disbanded in 2018. He continued: \"And rather than spending the money \u2014 and I'm a business person \u2014 I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them.\" The size of the team before cuts was estimated at 430 people, but the \"thousands\" referenced by the president also included reduction in the staff numbers of the CDC. The term \"Pandemic Response Team\" is a popularized, unofficial term for the former directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense. The term was popularized by a series of tweets from Popular Information author Judd Legum, claiming that \"Trump fired the entire Pandemic Response Team two years ago and didn't replace them\" and urging the rumor to spread by claiming \"more people should be talking about\" it. ==See also== * Homeland Security Advisor * Iran\u2013Contra affair * National Security Medal * National Security Advisor * National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism * Targeted killing * Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations * Tower Commission * Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal * Homeland Security Council ==References== ==Further reading== * Bahadir, Sanli. \"Arzin Merkezine Seyahat: ABD Ulusal G\u00fcvenlik Konseyi\" [\"Journey to the Center of the World: U.S. National Security Council\"].
