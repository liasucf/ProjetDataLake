These vessels were never commissioned and so technically do not qualify for the prefix \"HMS\". * Swallow was a tender in service between 1793 and 1795.Colledge (2006), p. 391.

He acquainted them of the existence of a state of war between Britain and France, and asked them if they would be willing to serve. He was able to recruit 40 so he purchased a lateen-rigged vessel long at the keel. He then sailed her to Toulon, where he put her under the command of Admiral Hood.Barrow (2009), p.79. (Hood was the Navy's commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, then engaged in blockading Toulon.) Swallow was among the British warships that shared in the capture, on 24 May 1793, of the French brigs Jacobin and Natine. On the night of 18 December, Smith was at Toulon and took Swallow, which was under the command of Lieutenant Hill, and three British and three Spanish gunboats to burn the French vessels and stores at the Arsenal as the English and Spanish forces were withdrawing, terminating their unsuccessful Siege of Toulon. Swallows primary role was to aim her guns at some 600 galley-slaves who were not in chains and showed signs of leaving their galleys to intervene and interfere with the British operations. Smith singled out four of Swallows crew for their role in preparing the combustibles for the operation.Barrow (2009), p.85. * Swallow was a cutter of 46 tons (bm) launched in 1811 at Deptford.
