    "text": "The 1942 Central Michigan Chippewas football team represented Central Michigan College of Education, later renamed Central Michigan University, as an independent during the 1942 college football season. The 1942 team was the first undefeated, untied football team in the school's history. In their sixth season under head coach Ron Finch, the Chippewas compiled a 6\u20130 record, shut out three opponents, held five of six opponents to fewer than seven points, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 93 to 21. The team defeated Northern Michigan (21\u20130), Grand Rapids Union (6\u20132, 20\u20136), Eastern Michigan (14\u20130), Ball State (19\u201313), and Wayne State (13\u20130). Right guard Warren Schmakel and end Don Provencher were the team co-captains. Schmakel was named as a first-team honoree on the Little All-America team, and fullback Harry Kaczynski received honorable mention on the same team. For 15 year prior to 1942, Central Michigan's athletic teams had been known as the \"Bearcats\". In January 1942, the school's student council voted to rename the teams the \"Chippewas\", because the area around the campus had for many years been the home of the Chippewa tribe of Michigan Indians. ==Schedule== ==References== ==External links== * 1943 Chippewa yearbook (page 70) Central Michigan Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Category:College football undefeated seasons Central Michigan Chippewas football ",
