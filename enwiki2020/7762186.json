This was the first season in which all four networks then in operation in the United States offered nightly prime time schedules Monday through Friday. The schedule below reflects the fall lineup as it all settled into place throughout October 1948, before any subsequent time changes were made and additional new series appeared in November. New fall series are highlighted in bold. A number of ABC's new fall shows began as early as mid-August when the network first began broadcasting a seven-night schedule. CBS and DuMont also had some new shows begin in the latter half of August. These shows are noted as such by (Aug.). NBC began airing Saturday Night Jamboree in December. Several notable programs debuted during the season and within the preceding summer. The preservation of these telecasts on kinescope film vary. The Texaco Star Theater proved to be one of the most notable hits of the year with its host, Milton Berle, credited with encouraging consumers to purchase their first television set. The 1948 episodes of the Berle show are missing, but many of the 1949 episodes still exist. A short-lived series, The Laytons, was the first network television sitcom to feature an African-American in a regular supporting role, albeit a stereotypical one. No episodes have survived. The Morey Amsterdam Show, which debuted on CBS in December, introduced television audiences to Art Carney as a lead cast member. In the David Weinstein book, The Forgotten Network, similarities between Carney's role as \"Charlie the Doorman\" and his later Ed Norton from Cavalcade of Stars and The Honeymooners are noted. The Morey Amsterdam Show was not a rating success. Four episodes are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Toast of the Town, debuting in June 1948 and re- titled The Ed Sullivan Show in 1955 and a mainstay of Sunday night viewing, became one of the most successful and long-running programs in American television history. It would remain on the air until 1971. The premier episode with composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and the comedy team of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis are among the few missing telecasts. == Fall Schedule == === Sunday === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;margin- right:0;text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:13%;\"|Network ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:30 p.m. |- !
