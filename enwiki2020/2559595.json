The festival promoted the new desktop digital filmmaking tools that were becoming available, which Hanson termed 'the film studio in your flat.' It allowed exploration of a film on a single screen, interactive and live audio-visual work. onedotzero was the first festival to present and commission audio visual performances, computer gaming visuals, music videos, and commercials in a film and arts context. The first festival in 1997 was produced with a short-lived new media arts collective, onearmbandit. From this group, new media and theatre producer Shane Walter joined Hanson as joint festival director for the second festival (onedotzero2,1998) and subsequent festivals. Hanson and Walter established the onedotzero company later in 1997. After Hanson resigned as director at the end of 2001 Walter continued as sole director of onedotzero6 and subsequent festivals. Other directors whose music video work was shown in early festivals include Chris Cunningham, Spike Jonze, Mike Mills and Michel Gondry.
