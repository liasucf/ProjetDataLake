    "text": "Buccinum scalariforme, common name the silky buccinum, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Buccinidae, the true whelks. ==Nomenclature== The name Buccinum scalariforme M\u00f8ller, 1842, is a junior homonym of Buccinum scalariforme Kiener, 1834. However, the latter has not been used as the valid name of a valid species after 1899, whereas Buccinum scalariforme M\u00f8ller, 1842, can be declared a nomen protectum under Art. 23.9 of the Code. WoRMS maintains this prevailing usage until such nomenclatural act is published. ==Description== The ovate shell is elongated, slightly turreted and pointed at the summit. The spire is composed of seven very convex rounded whorls, united by a shallow suture. Upon the whorls are regularly disposed longitudinal ribs or folds, crossed by numerous, fine, approximate striae, which, by their mutual intersection, cover the surface of the shell. The white aperture is slightly rounded. The thin outer lip is striated internally. The columella is arcuated and is covered by the inner lip. The coloring is whitish, sometimes ornamented with transverse bands.Kiener (1840). General species and iconography of recent shells : comprising the Massena Museum, the collection of Lamarck, the collection of the Museum of Natural History, and the recent discoveries of travellers; Boston :W.D. Ticknor,1837 (described as Buccinum scalariforme) ==Distribution== This species occurs in the North Atlantic Ocean; off Canada; in circum-arctic waters. ==References== * M\u00f6ller H.P.C. (1842).
