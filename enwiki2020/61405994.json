This is also the starting point of the famous Dong Khoi Street. The square is surrounded by two remarkable architectural works: Notre- Dame Cathedral and Central Post Office. == History == Bronze statue of Pigneau de Behaine and Prince C\u1ea3nh on the square, circa 1900s The square was originally named Place de la Cath\u00e9drale (roughly translated \"Cathedral Square\") dated back to the French colonial period. In 1903, the colonial government erected a bronze statue of French Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine and juvenile Prince Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac C\u1ea3nh in the center of the square. It was brought down in October 1945 leaving behind an empty statue pedestal. There was no statue on the site until 1959 under the First Republic of Vietnam, when a new statue of Our Lady of Peace () was erected in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The square itself was called H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Square (, literally \"Peace Square\"). In May 1964, the South Vietnamese government renamed it to President John F. Kennedy Square () honoring the assassinated U.S. President. The current name was coined after the Fall of Saigon, literally means \"Paris Commune Square\". == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Ho Chi Minh City ",
