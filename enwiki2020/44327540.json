Forced to leave Denmark during the Second World War, he also studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts under Otte Sk\u00f6ld (1944\u201345). He completed his studies in Paris under Andr\u00e9 Lhote. Gadegaard's early paintings were Naturalistic but from the end of the 1940s became Abstract, influenced by the Constructivist trend he encountered in Paris. In 1949, he joined the Linien II artists association where he exhibited until 1952. After the 1960s, his paintings became lighter in colour, initiating a style which became increasingly common in Denmark over the following years. In 1952, he began an association with Aage Damgaard who had a shirt factory in Herning. He decorated the factory canteen the following year and from 1957 to 1961, he comprehensively painted the inner walls of the Angli factory, becoming a pioneer of industrial art. His work covered an area of over , while he added appropriate furniture and appurtenances to complete the decorative effect. He painted the walls and ceilings in bright colours as well as the tables and shelves.

In 1977, Gadegaarde embarked on the decoration of Herning's Anglig\u00e5rden which he completed in 1882.
