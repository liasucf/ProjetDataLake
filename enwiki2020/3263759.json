    "text": "The General Jan Smuts Regiment (GJSR) a mechanised infantry regiment of the South African Army formerly called the Regiment Westelike Provincie.https://www.defenceweb.co.za/featured/new-reserve-force-unit-names/ As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or a United States Army National Guard unit. == History == ===Origin=== Regiment Westelike Provincie (R.W.P)South African Army C Army/D/PLAN/406/11/2 22 July 1980 (originally called Regiment Westelike Provinsie), is one of eight Afrikaner-oriented Traditional Citizen Force infantry units raised by the Union Defence Force on 1 April 1934, reproduced in as part of a programme to rebuild the UDF after the Great Depression. === Predecessors === While R.W.P has been in existence only since 1934, it regards itself as the successor to several small and short-lived units which were formed in the Western Cape country districts in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. They were: ==== First Volunteer Movement ==== * Stellenbosch Volunteers \u2013 formed 1856, disbanded * Worcester volunteers \u2013 formed 1856, disbanded * Paarl Rifle Corps \u2013 formed 1856, disbanded 1859 * Malmesbury Volunteer Cavalry \u2013 formed 1856, disbanded * Paarl Cavalry \u2013 formed 1857, disbanded 1859 * Paarl United Volunteers \u2013 formed 1859, disbanded * Robertson and Montague Rifle Corps \u2013 formed 1860, disbanded No volunteer units in these districts between 1866 and 1878. ==== Second Volunteer Movement ==== * Worcester Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1878, disbanded * Worcester Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1885, disbanded 1901 * Paarl Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1885, disbanded 1897 * Wellington Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1885, disbanded 1901 * Victoria College Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1888, disbanded 1899 * Robertson Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1890, disbanded * Malmesbury Volunteer Rifles \u2013 formed 1892, disbanded 1896. * Western Rifles \u2013 an administrative grouping, which existed from 1893 to 1908, of the Worcester, Paarl, Wellington, Stellenbosch, Robertson, and Malmesbury units * Western Light Horse \u2013 formed at Worcester 1903, disbanded 1908 * Paarl Volunteers \u2013 formed 1906, disbanded 1909.

At that time, Citizen Force service was voluntary. ===Brandy=== The new Regiment lost no time in ensuring that the inner man was cared for and in 1936 the first specially bottled R.W.P brandy was produced. The much honoured tradition of toasting the Regiment and dignitaries in pure, undiluted R.W.P brandy is still in use today. ===With the Union Defence Force=== ====World War Two==== The National Party-voting Western Cape districts generally did not support South Africa's involvement in World War II. In spite of this R.W.P was able to muster enough men who were willing to go on active service. The Regiment mobilised on 1 September 1940Union Defence Force Special Command Order No. 21 (M) 154/51/325/29 25 August 1940 and became No. 12 Armoured Car Company, South African Tank Corps.Union of South Africa Prime Minister's Office154/51/325/29 1 September 1940 After months of training in this new role, No12 Armoured Car Company was amalgamated with No. 11 Armoured Car Company (RSWD) Regiment Suid Westelike Distrikte, to form 5th Armoured Fighting Vehicle Regiment, South African Tank Corps.Union of South Africa Prime Minister's Office 154/51/325/11 17 March 1941 The Regiment moved to Egypt in September 1941 but was disbanded on 13 October 1941 after arrival. The personnel were used as reinforcements for depleted armoured car regiments already operating in the Western Desert with whom they participated in many of the well known battles in North Africa like Sidi Rezegh, Bir Hakeim, Gazala, and El Alamein. On the disbandment of the South African Tank Corps early in 1943, former R.W.P personnel were absorbed into the Royal Natal Carbineers and Imperial Light Horse and soon adapted themselves to tank warfare, serving with distinction in their new units with the 6th South African Armoured Division in Italy. ====Post war==== The Regiment was presented with a Regimental Colour by his Majesty King George VI during the visit of the Royal Family to South Africa on 31 March 1947. The wartime Prime Minister Gen Jan Smuts accepted the appointment as Colonel-In- Chief of the Regiment from 17 September 1948.Union of South Africa, Defence Forces Order No. 4144, 5 July 1949. ====Remustered and renamed==== In 1949, R.W.P itself was converted to Armour, and it was renamed Regiment Onze Jan, after 19th-century Afrikaner political leader Jan Hofmeyr, in 1951. From 1952, Citizen Force recruits were chosen by ballot rather than volunteering. During the 1950s and 1960s the Regiment was part of the part-time component of Western Province Command. ===With the SADF=== When the Army was re-organised for internal security duties in 1960, ROJ was converted back to infantry and was renamed Regiment Boland. R. Bol later moved to Paarl and, after the introduction of National Service conscription (in 1968), it formed a second battalion in Worcester on 1 September 1970. ====Divisional Command==== In 1975 the regiment became part of the conventional force structures mainly under the command of 71 Motorised Brigade (South Africa).South African Military History Society Cape Town Branch Newsletter, No. 328, January 1996, accessed December 2014. The Regiment took part in annual training camps since 1948, was part of the national mobilisation in 1960 and since the late seventies did training at the Army Battle School as part of 71 Mot Brigade, 75 Brigade and 9 Division . The two battalions were separated in April 1974. 1 R. Bol resumed the original title Regiment Westelike Provinsie and moved to Cape Town, while 2 R. Bol remained in Worcester as Regiment Boland. The only remnant of their association is the similar cap-badges of the two Regiments. ====Operations==== R.W.P served in the Angola campaign in 1976, and carried out several tours of duty in the Border War in South West Africa. It was also deployed on internal security duties in the Townships during the 1985\u201390 State of Emergency. ===With the SANDF=== Military service has been voluntary again since 1994. 71 Motorised Brigade and 9 Division was dissolved in the late nineties and the regiment presently forms part of the South African Army Infantry Formation. ====Name change==== In August 2019, 52 units of the Reserve Force had their names changed to reflect the diversity of the current SANDF.https://www.defenceweb.co.za/featured/new-reserve-force-unit-names/ This unit would henceforth be known as General Jan Smuts Regiment. == Regimental Symbols == ===Spelling=== In 1983, R.W.P adopted the Dutch spelling of \"Provincie\" because it regards itself as the successor to several short-lived volunteer units which existed in the Stellenbosch and Paarl and neighbouring districts in the 19th century, when Dutch, rather than Afrikaans, was the prevailing language in those areas. (See below for a list of those units.) ===Insignia=== * Badge : The Unit's Badge consists of a wreath of leaves of the Silver Leaf tree encompassing a kernel of the same tree with the inscription R.W.P Due to an error in the original artwork, the full stop after the \"P\"was omitted, hence creating a tradition that remains part of the Regimental history. * Flash : The beret flash (originally a helmet flash) has horizontal stripes of red over white over black, with a blue diamond on the white stripe: blue and white are the traditional colours of the Western Cape.Regiment Westelike Provincie Dress Code R.W.P/R406/11/ * Credo : \"Loyalty, Commitment, Excellence\" * March : De Trouwe Kameraad, a Dutch translation of the German Der Guten Kamerad. * Anniversaries : Regimental Day (1 April) Gen. JC Smuts Parade (24 May) * Brandy : R.W.P Brandewyn * Motto : Non Sibi Sed Patriae \u2013 Not for ourselves, but for our country. ====Previous Dress Insignia==== SADF era Regiment Westerlike Provincie insignia ====Current Dress Insignia==== SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia == Regimental Freedoms == R.W.P has been granted the Freedom of the following Cities: * * * * * * These honours mean that the Regiment may march on foot or mechanised with drums beating, colours flying and bayonets fixed through the streets of Cape Town or any of the Overstrand towns, namely Hermanus, Rooi Els, Pringle Bay, Betty's Bay, Kleinmond, Fisherhaven, Hawston, Onrus, Sandbaai, Stanford, Gansbaai, Uilenskraal Mond, Franskraal, Pearly Beach and Baardskeerdersbos. == Leadership == == Notes == == References == == External links == * SA Military History Journal Category:Infantry regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations of South Africa in the Border War Category:Military units and formations established in 1934 ",
