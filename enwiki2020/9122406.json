    "text": "The Jensen GT is a British sports car. It was introduced by Jensen Motors in 1975 as the shooting-brake version of the Jensen-Healey. The new configuration was a 2+2 design with a very limited back seat. Aside from the body shape and seating, relatively little differed from the roadster. Acceleration and top speed were slightly reduced due to the increased weight and additional smog control components on the engine. During its short production run from September 1975 to May 1976, 511 Jensen GTs were built before Jensen Motors went into receivership. Autocar reported that the Jensen marque's latest owners, The Jensen Group, were to begin production of a new, hand-built Jensen GT in 2016. As of 2018 this has not occurred. == Gallery == File:Jensen GT.jpg|Jensen GT File:JensenGT.jpg|Jensen GT (rear) == References == * * GT Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1975 ",
