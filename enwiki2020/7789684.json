Although the currently existing holding structure may be traced back as early as to the beginning of 2003, it was during the year 2004, when the long-lasting fundamentals of the holding company were laid down by the shareholders through accumulation of their shares in different companies under the umbrella of the Holding.

The retail business began when they could not resell a liquor store. Soon it became the main focus of the group.

Other companies included Vilniaus pauk\u0161tynas (poultry farm), Bir\u0161tono mineraliniai vandenys (mineral water), Vilniaus m\u0117sos kombinatas (meat packing), Vilniaus duona (bakery).
