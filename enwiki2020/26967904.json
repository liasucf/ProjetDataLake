    "text": "Bolt thrust or breech pressure is a term used in internal ballistics and firearms (whether small arms or artillery) that describes the amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. Bolt thrust is an important factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it. Assuming equal engineering solutions and material adding strength to a locking mechanism causes an increase in weight and size of locking mechanism components. Bolt thrust is not a measure to determine the amount of recoil or free recoil. ==Calculating bolt thrust== With a basic calculation the bolt thrust produced by a particular firearms cartridge can be calculated fairly accurately. ===Formula=== :\\vec{F}_{bolt} = P_{max} \\cdot A_{internal}. A Look at Bolt Lug Strength By Dan Lilja where: *Fbolt = the amount of bolt thrust *Pmax = the maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge *Ainternal = the inside area (of the cartridge case head) that the propellant deflagration gas pressure acts against Cartridge case heads and chambers are generally circular. The area enclosed by a circle is: :Area = \\pi r^2 \\approx 3{.}1416 \\cdot r^2. where: *\u03c0 \u2248 3.1416 *r = the radius of the circle Equivalently, denoting the diameter of the circle by d. :Area = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\approx 0{.}7854 \\cdot d^2. The green line denotes the internal case head diameter and the red line the external case head base diameter of a rifle cartridge case. A practical problem regarding this method is that the internal case head diameter of a particular production lot of cartridge cases (different brands and lots normally differ dimensionally) can not be easily measured without damaging them. ===Friction effects=== A complicating matter regarding bolt thrust is that a cartridge case expands and deforms under high pressure and starts to \"stick\" to the chamber. This \"friction-effect\" can be accounted for with finite elements calculations on a computer, but it is a lot of specialized work and generally not worth the trouble.Stolle Panda Bolt Stress and Deflection Analysis By oiling proof rounds during NATO EPVAT testing procedures, NATO test centers intentionally lower case friction to promote high bolt thrust levels. ==Practical method to estimate bolt thrust== Instead of using the internal case head diameter, the external case head base diameter can also be measured with a caliper or micrometer or taken from the appropriate C.I.P. or SAAMI cartridge or chamber data tables and used for bolt thrust estimation calculations. The basic calculation method is almost the same, but now the larger outside area of the cartridge case head is used instead of the smaller inside area. :\\vec{F_{bolt}} = P_{max} \\cdot A_{external}. where: *Fbolt = the amount of bolt thrust *Pmax = the maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge *Aexternal = the outside area of the cartridge case head This method is fine for getting a good estimate regarding bolt thrust and assumes an overly large area that the gas pressure acts against yielding pessimistic estimations, generating a safety margin in the process for worse case scenarios which can result in increased maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge, like a round that is chambered in an already very warm chamber that can result in cooking off (i.e. a thermally induced unintended firing). ===Bolt thrust estimations for various pistol/revolver cartridges=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! | Chambering || P1 diameter (mm) || Aexternal (cm2) || Pmax (bar) || Fbolt (kgf) || Fbolt |-s | .22 Long Rifle || 5.74 || 0.2587 || 1,650 || 427 || |- | 9\u00d719 mm Parabellum || 9.93 || 0.7744 || 2,350 || 1,820 || |- | .357 SIG || 10.77 || 0.9110 || 3,050 || 2,779 || |- | .380 ACP || 9.70 || 0.7390 || 1,500 || 1,130 || |- | .40 S&W; || 10.77 || 0.9110 || 2,250 || 2,050 || |- | 10 mm Auto || 10.81 || 0.9178 || 2,300 || 2,111 || |- | .45 ACP || 12.09 || 1.1671 || 1,300 || 1,517 || |- | .454 Casull || 12.13 || 1.1556 || 3,900 || 4,507 || |- | .500 S&W; Magnum || 13.46 || 1.4229 || 4,270 || 6,076 || |} The P1 (cartridge case base) diameters and Pmax used in the calculations were taken from the appropriate C.I.P. data sheets. ===Bolt thrust estimations for various rifle cartridges=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! | Chambering || P1 diameter (mm) || Aexternal (cm2) || Pmax (bar) || Fbolt (kgf) || Fbolt |-s | 5.45\u00d739mm || 10.00 || 0.7854 || 3,800 || 2,985 || |- | .223 Remington || 9.58 || 0.7208 || 4,300 || 3,099 || |- | 7.62\u00d739mm || 11.35 || 1.0118 || 3,550 || 3,592 || |- | .303 British || 11.68 || 1.0715 || 3,650 || 3,911 || |- | 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser || 11.97 || 1.1197 || 3,900 || 4,367 || |- | 7.65\u00d753mm Mauser / 7\u00d757mm || 12.01 || 1.1329 || 3,900 || 4,418 || |- | 6.5\u00d755mm || 12.20 || 1.1690 || 3,800 || 4,442 || |- | .30-06 Springfield / .308 Winchester || 11.96 || 1.1234 || 4,150 || 4,662 || |- | 7.62\u00d754mmR || 12.37 || 1.2018 || 3,900 || 4,687 || |- | 8mm Lebel || 13.77 || 1.4892 || 3,200 || 4,765 || |- | 7.5\u00d755mm Swiss GP 11 || 12.64 || 1.2548 || 3,800 || 4,768 || |- | .375 Holland & Holland Magnum / .300 Winchester Magnum || 13.03 || 1.3335 || 4,300 || 5,734 || |- | 6.5\u00d768mm / 8\u00d768mm S || 13.30 || 1.3893 || 4,400 || 6,113 || |- | .375 Ruger / .416 Ruger || 13.52 || 1.4356 || 4,300 || 6,173 || |- | .300 Remington Ultra Magnum || 13.97 || 1.5328 || 4,400 || 6,744 || |- | .300 Winchester Short Magnum || 14.12 || 1.5659 || 4,400 || 6,890 || |- | .338 Lapua Magnum || 14.91 || 1.7460 || 4,200 || 7,333 || |- | .300 Lapua Magnum / 7.62 UKM || 14.91 || 1.7460 || 4,400 || 7,807 || |- | .50 BMG || 20.42 || 3.2749 || 3,700 || 12,117 || |- | 14.5\u00d7114mm || 26.95 || 5.7044 || 3,600 || 20,536 || |} The P1 (cartridge case base) diameters and Pmax used in the calculations were taken from the appropriate C.I.P. data sheets. ==References== ==External links== *Blaser R93 Unf\u00e4lle - zur Verschlu\u00dfbelastung *Zylinderverschlu\u00df - Verschlu\u00dfkr\u00e4fte Category:Firearms Category:Firearm actions Category:Firearm terminology Category:Ammunition ",
