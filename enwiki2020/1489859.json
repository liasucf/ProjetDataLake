The race is held in November or early December each year on a week usually to suit the mid-morning or mid-afternoon timing of the ebb tide. ==History== The Scullers Head was first raced in 1954 when it was won by John Marsden.Daily Telegraph Obituary John Marsden 5 March 2004 It now admits entries of over 500 scullers Main page noting new facts and full capacity of 550 entries has been reached in 2014. Retrieved 17 November 2014. and is the largest sculling race in the UK for a single class of racing shell. The race gains enough entries to organise the greatest number of marshalls for any singles event on the Thames and it draws considerably more overseas single scullers than the same race held in reverse usually three to four weeks before, the Wingfield Sculls, which dates to the middle of the 19th century. In 2014 were the first admissions of categories for adaptive rowing for athletes with disabilities, in TA and LTA adaptive rowing classifications. ==Annual organisation== The race is organised by Vesta Rowing Club, Putney, London. ==Results since 1990== ===Men=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Held in late May/very early June at Eton-Dorney Lake. *Diamond Challenge Sculls rowed by race-winning singles at Henley Royal Regatta, forming the second prerequisite of the rare accomplishment of a 'Triple Crown' with those above and below. Held in July. *Wingfield Sculls rowed by singles along the course in reverse, the last component of the 'Triple Crown'. Held in October or early November. Where the Scullers' Head is also won there is the theoretical possibility of a 'Quadruple Crown' for a single sculler able to win all four events. As the Diamond Sculls is not open to women, a win at the Scullers Head forms the last leg of the UK's Triple Crown for an all-round champion female single sculler. *Rowing on the River Thames ==References== ==External links== *Scullers Head Category:Mortlake, London Category:Rowing in the United Kingdom Category:Water sports in London Category:1954 in sports Category:Rowing races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1954 ",
