The tournament was played in Apopka, Florida during April 2007. Vanderbilt defeated Maryland\u2013Eastern Shore in the championship match, 4 games to 3, to win their first national title. ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 8 teams were invited to contest this championship, which consisted of a modified double-elimination style tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
