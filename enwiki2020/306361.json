    "text": "Doris Elizabeth Angleton (n\u00e9e McGown; (also Beck) April 11, 1951 \u2013 April 16, 1997) was an American socialite and murder victim. Her husband, Robert Angleton, had been accused of planning the crime. Roger Nicholas Angleton, Robert Angleton's brother, admitted to directly killing his sister-in-law and exonerated his brother before killing himself. ==Early life== Doris Elizabeth McGown was the first child born to Alfred Randolph McGown, a Dow Chemical engineer, and his wife, Ann McGown (n\u00e9e Bain). She grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, and had one sibling, a younger brother, Steven Randolph McGown. She graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in speech pathology. After graduation, she began a career as a schoolteacher, and later became a sales representative for a pharmaceutical firm. ==Marriages== In 1976, McGown met William Beck, a representative for an office products company. They married and moved to Clear Lake City. She met Robert Angleton, a successful bookmaker, at a bar in the Houston West Loop when she was 28 years old. According to Robert Angleton, he and Doris met because William Beck, Doris's husband, was a client of his bookmaking business. Both Robert Angleton and Doris Beck, although already married, were attracted to each other, eventually divorcing their spouses. They married in 1982. On August 1, 1984, Doris Angleton gave birth to twins, Nicole and Alessandra.Smith, Carlton (July 15, 1999). Death in Texas: A True Story of Marriage, Money, and Murder. St. Martin's True Crime. Robert Angleton earned an estimated $2 million a year by running a sports-betting scheme. He managed to do this by becoming a police informant and reporting his rivals to the Houston Police Department. He moved his family to the wealthy River Oaks area of Houston, Texas. Although her friends believed that she was happy, Doris Angleton had reportedly told others that she wanted out of her marriage when she grew tired of bookmaking. In February 1997, she went ahead with the divorce process, seeking 50 percent of their joint assets. ==Murder== On April 16, 1997, Robert Angleton expressed concern when Doris failed to show up for their twin daughters' softball game. After the game, he drove the girls home and finding the door ajar, called the police. An officer discovered Doris' body. She sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the face and chest. Around the time of her murder, Doris' brother- in-law, Roger Angleton, had been arrested in California on unrelated charges. He missed his court date in that case (which was April 16, 1997). He was stopped at the DFW Airport 5 days later with two guns in his luggage but fled before being arrested. Police searched the abandoned suitcase that revealed him to be her killer. Roger was found by police in the Las Vegas city jail, having been arrested for providing false identification to police.
