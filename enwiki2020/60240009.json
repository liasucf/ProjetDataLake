He became a voivode after joining the Serbian Chetnik Organization in 1903. Until 1917 he participated in the wars as a lieutenant colonel.http://www.maticasrpska.org.rs/biografije/tom04.pdf He was buried at sea with hundreds of others who survived the Serbian army's retreat through Albania only to fall ill from the excruciating experience and die of hunger or disease after having reached Corfu. After the retreat of the Serbian Army through Albania at the end of 1915, the French fleet transported around 150,000 Serbs to the island of Corfu during January and February of 1915. Jezdi\u0107 was among the soldiers, exhausted by the strenuous march through mountainous Montenegro and Albania, some were dying in staggering numbers while the most seriously ill soldiers and patients were disembarked on a small, rocky island called Vido close to Corfu, which was organized as a temporary field hospital. Without any possibility of being buried on the stony island, the surrounding sea was converted into a \"blue sea tomb\", where more than 5,000 people were lowered. Vido Island, near Corfu, was a haven for those involved in Serbia\u2019s Great Retreat, a mass escape of king and civilians. It functioned as a quarantine area. Because the rock composition of the island made it hard to dig graves, those who died on the journey were buried at sea. It\u2019s assumed that several thousand were buried this way. The sea around it is called Plava Grobnica or the Blue Tomb by Serbian people. The retreat of the Serbian army and civilians through the Prokletije mountain range that encompasses Serbia, Montenegro and Albania represents part of the great tragedy of Serbia in World War I. Corfu and Salonika was the place where the army recuperated and regrouped before departing for the front at Salonika. ==In literature== Brother-at-arms and war poet Milosav Jeli\u0107 wrote a poem memorializing Jezdi\u0107's short but brave life. Poet Milutin Boji\u0107, who survived the Albanian retreat, witnessed the bodies tossed at sea, and eventually succumbed to tuberculosis and died in Salonika, also wrote a moving tribute entitled Ode to a Blue Sea Tomb (Plava Grobnica).https://corfublues.blogspot.com/2010/01/plava-grobnica-blue- graveyard-milutin.html ==References== * Sources: \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0442\u043e\u043c 4, \u0441. 35.
