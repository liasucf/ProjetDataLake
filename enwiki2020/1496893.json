It links Shing Sai Road in Kennedy Town to the west and Harcourt Road in Admiralty to the east. ==Location== The road consists of two adjoining sections, namely Connaught Road Central () and Connaught Road West (). Connaught Road Central runs the length of Central, parallel to the north shore. It runs from approximately Admiralty in the east, where it connects Harcourt Road at the junction with Murray Road. The road ends west on Tai Street, where it becomes Connaught Road West. Connaught Road West runs towards the Kennedy Town and Pok Fu Lam areas in the west. For most of the stretch, Connaught Road West runs beneath the Connaught Road West Flyover, (Route 4). It is the main thoroughfare to the entrance of the Western Harbour Tunnel and beyond to Shek Tong Tsui, where it merges with Des Voeux Road West. ==History== This road was once a waterfront promenade with boats docked against the northern side of the road. In 1889, the north shore of Victoria City was under extensive reclamation. In 1890, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn visited Hong Kong, when Francis Fleming, the then acting governor announced a new road to be constructed in front of the old \"Bowring Praya\"(present day Des Voeux Road ). This newly constructed road was then named Connaught Road, after the prince. A statue of the Duke once also occupied the junction of Pedder Street. Connaught Road West was lined with many piers in the past. Rice wholesalers gathered there owing to its proximity to the shore. Due to reclamation of the harbour, the entire length of Connaught Road has now become landlocked. ==Structures along Connaught Road== * AIG Tower * Hong Kong Club Building * Statue Square * Hong Kong City Hall * Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong * Connaught Place * Chater House * Jardine House * Central Elevated Walkway * World-Wide House * Exchange Square * International Finance Centre Tower One * Wing On House * Hang Seng Bank Headquarters Building * Shun Tak Centre ==Gallery== Image:Chater House 2008.jpg| Connaught Road frontage of Chater House Image:aigtower.jpg|AIG Tower, 1 Connaught Road Central Image:HK Statue Square Xmas Tree Mandarin Oriental Hotel.JPG|The Mandarin Oriental Hotel Image:HK Chater Road Statue Square.jpg|Statue Square abuts Connaught Road Image:HK Club Connaught Road Central.JPG|The Hong Kong Club Building's frontage on Connaught Road Image:City Hall from Statue Square.jpg|City Hall facing Connaught Road Image:HK Connaught Garden Henry Moore sculture 6.JPG|Henry Moore's sculpture, Connaught Place Image:Central Walkway.jpg|The Central Elevated Walkway crosses Connaught Road Image:Connaught Road Central daytime 2.jpg|Connaught Road, looking west (1IFC on the right) Image:HK Connaught Road C Hang Seng Bank Jubilee Street.JPG|New Headquarters of the Hang Seng Bank Image:Hkshuntak.jpg|Connaught Road West Flyover leading up to the Shun Tak Centre (background) Image:WingOnHouseCentralHKG.jpg|Wing On House (middle); the two buildings to the right are the old and new headquarters of Hang Seng Bank Image:HK 2 ChinaChem Plaza China Insurance Group Building 5.JPG|ChinaChem Plaza and the China Insurance Group Building are both on Connaught Road Central Image:Connaught_road_west_night_view_2019.10.jpg|Connaught Road West at night ==See also== * List of streets and roads in Hong Kong ==References== Category:Roads in Hong Kong Category:Route 4 (Hong Kong) Category:Central and Western District, Hong Kong ",
