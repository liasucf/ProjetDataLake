It was organized by LMDT (Liga Metropolitana de Desportos Terrestres, or Metropolitan Land Sports League). Sixteen teams participated. Vasco da Gama won the title for the 1st time. No teams were relegated. ==Participating teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Club !! Home location !!

The teams in each group played each other in a double round-robin format. The champions of S\u00e9rie A and S\u00e9rie B would qualify into the Finals, while the last-placed team in S\u00e9rie B would dispute a playoff against the champions of the Second Level. *Final stage: However, before the Finals, the champions of S\u00e9rie B would have to play against the last-placed team of S\u00e9rie A. If they won that match, they qualified for the Finals while the other team would be relegated to the S\u00e9rie B. In case of any other result, the S\u00e9rie A champions would win the title automatically, and no relegation or promotion across groups would take place. ==Championship== ===S\u00e9rie A=== ===S\u00e9rie B=== ====Playoffs==== ===Final phase=== Villa Isabel eliminated; Vasco da Gama declared champions ===Final standings=== ===Relegation Playoffs=== The regulation stipulated that a playoff would be held between Americano, the last-placed team in S\u00e9rie B and Hell\u00eanico, the champions of the Second Level. Hell\u00eanico won the playoff. Americano would have been relegated, but after the subsequent split between LMDT and AMEA, Americano participated in the 1924 LMDT championship anyway. ==References== Category:Campeonato Carioca seasons Carioca ",
