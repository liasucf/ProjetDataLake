There is one self-dual regular form, the 5-simplex with 6 vertices. Each can be visualized as symmetric orthographic projections in Coxeter planes of the A5 Coxeter group, and other subgroups. == Graphs == Symmetric orthographic projections of these 19 polytopes can be made in the A5, A4, A3, A2 Coxeter planes. Ak graphs have [k+1] symmetry. For even k and symmetrically nodea_1ed- diagrams, symmetry doubles to [2(k+1)]. These 19 polytopes are each shown in these 4 symmetry planes, with vertices and edges drawn, and vertices colored by the number of overlapping vertices in each projective position. {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=3|# !colspan=4|Coxeter plane graphs !rowspan=3|Coxeter-Dynkin diagram Schl\u00e4fli symbol Name |- ![6] ![5] ![4] ![3] |- !A5 !A4 !A3 !A2 |- align=center !1 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | {3,3,3,3} 5-simplex (hix) |- align=center !2 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t1{3,3,3,3} or r{3,3,3,3} Rectified 5-simplex (rix) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !3 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t2{3,3,3,3} or 2r{3,3,3,3} Birectified 5-simplex (dot) |- align=center !4 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1{3,3,3,3} or t{3,3,3,3} Truncated 5-simplex (tix) |- align=center !5 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t1,2{3,3,3,3} or 2t{3,3,3,3} Bitruncated 5-simplex (bittix) |- align=center !6 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,2{3,3,3,3} or rr{3,3,3,3} Cantellated 5-simplex (sarx) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !7 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t1,3{3,3,3,3} or 2rr{3,3,3,3} Bicantellated 5-simplex (sibrid) |- align=center !8 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,3{3,3,3,3} Runcinated 5-simplex (spix) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !9 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,4{3,3,3,3} or 2r2r{3,3,3,3} Stericated 5-simplex (scad) |- align=center !10 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,2{3,3,3,3} or tr{3,3,3,3} Cantitruncated 5-simplex (garx) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !11 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t1,2,3{3,3,3,3} or 2tr{3,3,3,3} Bicantitruncated 5-simplex (gibrid) |- align=center !12 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,3{3,3,3,3} Runcitruncated 5-simplex (pattix) |- align=center !13 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,2,3{3,3,3,3} Runcicantellated 5-simplex (pirx) |- align=center !14 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,4{3,3,3,3} Steritruncated 5-simplex (cappix) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !15 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,2,4{3,3,3,3} Stericantellated 5-simplex (card) |- align=center !16 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,2,3{3,3,3,3} Runcicantitruncated 5-simplex (gippix) |- align=center !17 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,2,4{3,3,3,3} Stericantitruncated 5-simplex (cograx) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !18 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,3,4{3,3,3,3} Steriruncitruncated 5-simplex (captid) |- BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" align=center !19 | 80px | 80px | 80px | 80px | t0,1,2,3,4{3,3,3,3} Omnitruncated 5-simplex (gocad) |} == References== * H.S.M.
