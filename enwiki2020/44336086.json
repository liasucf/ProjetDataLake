In 1910, following the resignation of It\u014d Hirobumi as Resident- General of Korea, Yamagata accompanied the new Resident Sone Arasuke to Korea as Deputy Resident-General. Following the formal annexation of Korea to the Empire of Japan, Yamagata remained for the next nine years as Inspector- General of Korea, (a position equivalent to that of Deputy Governor-General), under the tenure of Governor-General Terauchi Masatake and Hasegawa Yoshimichi. Although considered to be the leading candidate to replace Hasegawa, Yamagata was removed from office during the government reorganization following the March 1 Movement in 1919. page 125 He subsequently served as Governors-General of Kwantung Leased Territory from May 1920 to September 1922.
