    "text": "Thomas Sauer (November 11, 1970 \u2014 March 24, 2020) was an American retired mixed martial artist. A professional competitor from 1998 to 2012, he competed for RINGS and the World Fighting Alliance. ==Background== A native of Cleveland, Sauer moved with his family to Ocala, Florida in 1981 at the age of 11. From a young age, he began wrestling and karate. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Having made his debut in 1998, Sauer quickly moved to 3\u20130 with a win over Jeff Monson before being handed his first professional defeat at the hands of Travis Fulton. After five more wins followed by consecutive defeats to Bobby Hoffman and John Dixson, respectively, Sauer began competing for the RINGS promotion. ===RINGS=== Sauer made his RINGS debut on May 20, 2000, winning via first-round submission. After another win followed by a knockout of Valentijn Overeem, Sauer was defeated via doctor stoppage from a cut against Vladimir Matyushenko. Sauer would go 6\u20135 in his next 11 fights before facing off against Enson Inoue at SuperBrawl 35 on April 16, 2004. Sauer won via first-round TKO in arguably the biggest win of his career. ===Independent promotions=== Sauer went 7\u20133 in the last ten fights of his career, last defeating Ruben Villareal via first-round submission in 2012. ==Personal life== Sauer founded his own gym, \"Team Trauma\" in 1998 in Ocala, Florida. Sauer was a firefighter and EMT from 1996 until his retirement in 2019. Sauer also had his own aluminum construction company in Ocala, FL. In his community, he was famous for his big heart as well as strong hands. He constantly and without hesitation helped friends and strangers alike, be it an uplifting conversation, meal, or surprise Christmas gifts. Sauer was happily married to the love of his life, Sherrie Sauer for 10 years with whom he just built his dream home at the unexpected time of his death. Sauer had 4 children and 2 stepchildren who were the pride and joy of his life. He lived his life with Tourette Syndrome, and made light of the situation often. He would often make an off the wall or humorous statement then say that no one could be upset with him for it because no one would want to pick on the man with Tourette\u2019s. Living with the disease was a struggle for him as a child, but ultimately led him to his professional fighting career. He found peace in the control fighting offered him. |- | Win | align=center| 25\u201312 | Ruben Villareal | Submission | R.F.C. 26: Legends Return | | align=center| 1 | align=center| 0:40 | Ocala,
