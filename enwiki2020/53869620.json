    "text": "Ride the Cyclone is a musical with music, lyrics and book by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell. It tells the story of the members of St. Cassian High School chamber choir of Uranium City, Saskatchewan, who perish on a faulty rollercoaster called \"The Cyclone\". Each tells a story to win the reward of a mechanical fortune teller \u2014 the chance to return to life. == Productions == The world premiere production took place in Victoria, British Columbia at Atomic Vaudeville in 2008. A production played at the Theatre Passe Muraille, Toronto in 2011, and there was a tour of Western Canada in 2013. The American premiere took place at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Directed by Rachel Rockwell, the production opened on 29 September 2015, playing a limited run until 8 November. With Rockwell again directing, the show opened Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre with an official opening night on 30 November 2016, ending its limited run on 18 December. Taylor Louderman was initially cast in the production but withdrew during previews, citing creative differences. She was replaced by original Chicago company member Tiffany Tatreau. The cast also included Alex Wyse. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised the show, stating \"this delightfully weird and just plain delightful show... will provide the kind of thrills we look for in all musical comedies, however outlandish their subject matter: an engaging and varied score, knocked out of the park by a superlative cast, and a supremely witty book.\" ==Plot== Our host for the evening is Karnack, Wonderville's mechanical fortune teller automaton. Karnak reveals that he will die soon, as a rat is chewing his power cable. The insensate Karnack was able to predict the exact moment of a person's death but the carnival set him to \"Family Fun Mode\" and he could only repeat fairground advertising: \"Your lucky number is eight. Ride the Cyclone.\" He tells the audience that a small town choir has ridden the fair's roller coaster, the Cyclone, to their deaths. Five teens arrive in limbo. Karnak informs them of their impending demise, but offers to use the last of his power to send one of them back to the land of the living. Ocean Rosenberg insults the other teens for their dead-end lives. She sings that she deserves more life as she's the only one with the potential for success. (What the World Needs) . But Karnack decrees that the choice of who lives will be by consensus. The other teens include Misha, a Ukrainian refugee who alternates between Gangsta Rap and a Ukrainian love ballad to his online girlfriend. Noel, the only homosexual in his small town who dreams of being a cold hearted French prostitute. Ricky, born with a degenerative disease that left him mute, but developed a rich fantasy life to retreat into. Finally, Constance, Ocean's best friend and the \"nicest girl in town\" but who has grown to loathe her town and family. The teens sing about their hopes, dreams and fantasies. One, Jane Doe, sings about despair. The headless body of Jane Doe was found in the wreckage and assumed to be one of the choir. She was decapitated in the accident and no one claimed the body. Her spirit has no memory of who she was and no idea what will happen to her in the afterlife. Finally, Constance sings of her love for her life and town and how all her anger and misconceptions dropped away when the roller coaster derailed. At last it is time for the vote but Karnak changes the rules. He tells Ocean that she alone will get the deciding vote. Having a crisis of conscience she refuses to vote for herself. She calls for a vote, saying that Jane is the only one who doesn't have memories to take to the afterlife with her, and the others decide to send her back. Jane goes through the portal and regains her memories and life as Penny Lamb (A character in Richmond's play LEGOLAND) We see a quick home movie of her remaining life from youth to old age. Karnak shorts out, repeating \"Ride the Cyclone\" before the remaining teens sing a peppy song (It's a Ride) as their spirits travel to whatever comes next. ==Musical numbers== * \"Dream of Life\" \u2013 Jane Doe * \"Uranium\" \u2013 Ensemble * \"Sailing Through Space\" \u2013 Ensemble * \"What the World Needs\" \u2013 Ocean O\u2019Connell Rosenberg and Ensemble * \"Noel's Lament\" \u2013 Noel Gruber and Ensemble * \"This Song is Awesome\" \u2013 Mischa Bachinski and Ensemble * \"Talia\" \u2013 Mischa Bachinski and Ensemble * \"Space Aged Bachelor Man\" \u2013 Ricky Potts and Ensemble * \"The Ballad of Jane Doe\" \u2013 Jane Doe and Ensemble * \"The New Birthday Song\" \u2013 Ensemble * \"Sugarcloud\" \u2013 Constance Blackwood and Ensemble * \"It's Not a Game\" \u2013 Ensemble * \"Sailing Through Space (Reprise)\" \u2013 Ensemble * \"It\u2019s Just a Ride\" \u2013 Ensemble ==Cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\" |- !
