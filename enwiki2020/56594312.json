    "text": "An indirect presidential election was held in the National Assembly in South Africa on 15 February 2018 following the resignation of Jacob Zuma on 14 February. Acting president Cyril Ramaphosa of the ruling African National Congress won the election unopposed due to no other party nominating a candidate. Ramaphosa was sworn-in by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng at 5pm, 15 February 2018. ==Background== Following the announcement of the resignation of President Jacob Zuma late on 14 February 2018, and official receipt of a letter of resignation by the Speaker of Parliament during the morning of 15 February, Parliament was convened to elect a new president. The President of South Africa is elected by the members of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The upper house, the National Council of Provinces, does not participate in the election. In a press conference before the session, Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) announced that his party will not participate in the election. ==Election== Shortly after the start of the sitting of Parliament the EFF objected to the legitimacy of the process, stating that parliament should be dissolved and a general election called. All members of the EFF then walked out. The Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, Mogoeng Mogoeng presided over the election. He began proceedings by reading Zuma's letter of resignation. Parties traditionally nominate their respective leaders as candidates. Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the African National Congress and Acting President since Zuma's resignation, was the only nominee. Thus there was no ballot and Ramaphosa was declared duly elected. ==Responses== * Mosiuoa Lekota, leader of the Congress of the People party objected to the nomination of Ramaphosa, and said his party will take the issue to the Constitutional Court. * Mmusi Maimane, leader of the Democratic Alliance, congratulated President Ramaphosa, but reminded the house of their motion to dissolve Parliament and call for an early general election. ==Oath of Office== In a brief ceremony at Tuynhuys, the office of the Presidency in Cape Town, President Elect Ramaphosa was sworn in as the fifth post-apartheid President of South Africa, shortly after 17:00 SAST (15:00 UTC) on 15 February by the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court. == References == Category:2018 elections in South Africa Category:February 2018 events in Africa 2018 ",
