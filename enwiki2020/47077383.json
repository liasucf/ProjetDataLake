Vol. History. Beijing and Shanghai: Zhongguo dabaike quanshu chubanshe, p.50. They were designated binke, (), shike (), menke (). Retainers stayed long-term at the house of their host, were fed by him,Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972): Han Social Structure. Seattle and London: University of Washington Press, p.127. and obtained also many other benefits through him, such as money, reputation, social position, appreciation, and so on.Bao Jiashu \u9c8d\u5bb6\u6811 (2010): \"Xian Qin 'menke' jiqi jingshen jizhi tanjiu\" \u5148\u79e6\"\u95e8\u5ba2\"\u53ca\u5176\u7cbe\u795e\u57fa\u8d28\u7814\u7a76 [A Study of Retainers in the Pre-Qin Period and Their Spiritual Basis]. Journal of Hainan Normal University \u6d77\u5357\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66\u62a5, no.5 (2010), p.142. In return, a retainer would have rendered certain services to his host. But he was free to come and go, and he could leave when he was not treated politely or when he disapproved of the behavior of his host.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129. == The historical development == The practice of keeping retainers can be traced back to the Warring States period (ca. 476-221 BCE). Ancient Chinese social structure was changing during this time, the system of feudal states created by the Western Zhou dynasty underwent enormous changes after 771 BCE with the flight of the Zhou court to Chengzhou (modern- day Luoyang) and the diminution of the court's relevance and power.Scott Cook (2010): \"'San De' and Warring States Views on Heavenly Retribution.\" Journal of Chinese Philosophy, no.37 (2010), pp.101-123. The sovereign (king of Zhou) was merely a figurehead and the social hierarchy which formerly had depended on blood-relationship to the king of the Zhou was severely impacted by the move.Bao Jiashu\u9c8d\u5bb6\u6811 (2010): Journal of Hainan Normal University, p.142. The Spring and Autumn period led to a few states gaining power at the expense of many others, the latter no longer able to depend on central authority for legitimacy or protection. During the Warring States period, many rulers claimed the Mandate of Heaven to justify their conquest of other states and spread their influence.S. Cook (2010), p.102. The number of retainers one was able to keep seems to have been a status symbol, and keeping retainers also served as a means to augment political power.Shiji \u53f2\u8a18 (by Sima Qian\u53f8\u99ac\u9077 [ca. 145-86 BCE] et al., Baina edition, 1931, 77:1a; cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.128. A retainer could with his own ability and efforts acquire benefits and improve his social status.Bao Jiashu\u9c8d\u5bb6\u6811 (2010), p.142. Therefore, there were lots of noblemen keeping retainers, and some of them kept a maximum of about three thousand retainers. This pre-Qin practice of keeping retainers was continued in Qin times (BCE 221-207). Li Si \u674e\u65af (BCE 280-208), the imperial chancellor, and Zhao Gao \u8d75\u9ad8, the powerful eunuch, each kept a number of retainers.Sanguo Zhi\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7 [Records of the Three Kingdom] (by Chen Shou \u9673\u58fd [ca. 233-297 BCE] et al.), Baina edition,1931, Wei, 12:20b, 18:1a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130. Having retainers was still very popular in Han times, the largest number of retainers reported for the Han was ca. one thousand.Hanshu\u6f22\u66f8 (by Ban Gu \u73ed\u56fa [32-92 BCE] et al.), Baina edition, 1931, 34:24a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972) p.130. Under the protection of a powerful master a retainer usually was able to avoid the payment of taxes. Furthermore, the government had difficulty in levying labor and military service from the retainers of powerful person. Under the protection of a master some guests engaged I robbery, murder, and other unlawful activities.Hanshu 86:2a, cited in Jack L. Dull (1972), p.131. It seems that there developed a sort of patron-client relationship. The host became more demanding and arrogant, while the retainers became more subservient.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.131. The number of retainers kept by a host again increased in the era of the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE). There were two instances of men who kept more than a thousand retainers. This sudden increase is understandable: during the wars and disturbed periods of the Later Han and thereafter, every powerful person was ambitious to use his strength to acquire political power and tended to keep a large number of retainers who actually were his personal troops.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972)., p.130. From the end of the Early Han the retainers began to participate in production, particularly in the cultivation of land. This tendency was more dominant at the end of the Later Han and in the years of the Three Kingdoms. For example, a provincial governor sent ten of his retainers to build a house and plant orange trees. The family derived a profit worth several thousand rolls of silk from the produce yearly and became wealthy. They actually became tenants, who paid labor and earned remunerations.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.132. == The role of the host == The host was expected to provide lodging, food, clothing and even carriages for his retainers and to treat them generously. Some of the most honored retainers were even given luxurious articles such as pearls and jade.Shiji 78:7b, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972) Obviously only the wealthy nobles and officials could afford to support a large number of retainers. Prince Tian Wen \u7530\u6587 (?-279 BCE) of Qi (state)\u9f50, Prince Zhao Sheng \u8d99\u52dd (?- 251 BCE) of Zhao (state) \u8d99, Prince Wei Wuji \u9b4f\u7121\u5fcc (?-243 BCE) of Wei, and Chancellor Huang Xie \u9ec4\u6b47 (?-238 BCE) of the State of Chu (state), all tried to have more and more retainers.Shiji 78:7b, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.127. A prince with such an enormous number of retainers under his command usually was powerful enough to control his own state. Sometimes a state did not even dare to fight with a neighboring state because the ruler had thousands of retainers.Shiji p.77:1a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.128. While the number of retainers kept by a master could be enormous, they must have varied greatly in personality and qualification; and of course their selection depended heavily on the attitudes and disposition of the patron.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130. == The social status of retainers == In the pre-Qin time, the social status of a retainer was not an inferior one. A master, though much superior in political and social status as well as in wealth, had to treat his retainers politely. But guests did not all have the same status, nor were they all treated the same. As a rule, those who engaged in humble occupation and were looked down upon by society were also held in less respect as retainers. A man without special ability was also considered inferior by his master and his fellow retainers.Shiji 76:2b, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129. The status of retainers in the Later Han, and especially in the era of the Three Kingdoms, was markedly inferior; retainers were asked to engage in productive and menial labor and were treated more like slaves or servants.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p134. == The function of retainers == In pre-Qin times, the retainer seldom had definite obligations, and usually no routine work was assigned to him. He was expected to render occasional service according to his abilities when there was such a demand. When Prince Tian Wen \u7530\u6587 wanted to send someone to collect his debts, he inquired of his retainers whether one of them was versed in accounting and competent for his job.Shiji 75:8b-9a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129. Sometimes the mission was difficult or even dangerous. A retainer was expected to do what the master asked of him and even risk his life for him. Hundreds of retainers were ready to give up their lives to follow Prince Wei Wuji \u9b4f\u7121\u5fcc.Shiji 87:3b-5a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.127. In Han times, retainers served in various capacities. They were intelligent men who served as personal advisors to high officials.Hanshu 52:2b-3a, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.131. Others were engaged in physical and menial work. Some retainers served as bodyguards.Sanguozhi, Wei, 11:9 a-b, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130. It was not uncommon to ask a retainer to assassinate an enemy.Hanshu 84:2b, cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972) , p. 130 Under unusual conditions retainers were even asked to engage in robbery and other unlawful activities.Hanshu 47:5a, 86:2a. cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p. As a rule, retainers were expected to share the suffering of their master and offer help in times of emergency or danger. Retainers also had obligations to defend the family of their master when it was attacked by bandits or enemies.Hou Hanshu \u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8 (by Fan Ye\u8303\u66c4 [ca. 398-445 BCE] et al., Baina edition, 1931, 33:12a. cited in Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p. 151. The military services of retainers obviously were a help in seeking military and political power.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.132. Retainers were usually not asked to perform domestic or productive work in the pre-Qin through early Han periods, but from the end of the early Han the retainers participated in production, particularly in the cultivation of land, and this tendency was more dominant at the end of Later Han and Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) periods. During this time, retainers were treated in the same manner as slaves, and slaves and retainers were expected to perform the same kind of menial work.Ch'\u00fc T'ung-tsu (1972), p.134. == Famous retainers in history == Sun Bin \u5b6b\u81cf, the famous retainer in the residence of Tian Ji \u7530\u5fcc in the Warring States period. Once, King Wei of Qi invited Tian Ji to a horse racing competition. Sun Bin suggested a strategy to Tian Ji to utilize his horses to the best advantage, and Tian won two out of three rounds in the race. The king was impressed with Tian's victory. Tian admitted that he won with the help of Sun Bin, and recommended Sun's talents to the king. King Wei wanted to appoint Sun Bin as the commander of the Qi armies. Sun declined, as his handicap prevented him from riding horseback, and would have a negative effect on the morale of soldiers. Sun was then appointed chief military advisor instead and served as Tian Ji's deputy.Shiji: Chapter 65, Sun Bin, as of 24 Jun 2015 ==Literature== *Editorial Committee of Encyclopedia of China\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66\u7f16\u59d4\u4f1a(1986): Zhonguo Dabaike Quanshu\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66Encyclopedia of China.
