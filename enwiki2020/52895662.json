Vid. Galatia. Arcan. Cathol. Ver. l. 3. c. 30. to whom this and all the rest of the characters in the text agree; and who may be so called with respect to his incarnation, being the firstborn that opened the womb, and broke forth into the world in a very extraordinary manner; his birth being of a virgin, who was so both before and after the birth; thus Pharez had his name, which is from the same root, and is of a similar sound with Phorez here, from his breaking forth before his brother, unawares, and contrary to expectation, Genesis 38:29.John Gill. John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible. Exposition of the Old and New Testament. Published in 1746-1763. * \"The breaker is come (gone) up before them\": Micah depicts Israel's redemption under the figure of release from captivity. The passage is clearly Messianic, and can neither be considered an interpolation nor tortured into a declaration of the siege and ruin of Samaria or Jerusalem.Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. * \"Passed through the gate\": They \"break through,\" not to enter in but to \"pass through the gate and go forth.\" The wall of the city is ordinarily broken through, in order to make an entrance Psalm 80:13; Psalm 89:41; Isaiah 5:5; Nehemiah 2:13, or to secure to a conqueror the power of entering in Proverbs 25:28; 2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chronicles 25:23; 2 Chronicles 26:6 at any time, or by age and decay 2 Chronicles 32:5. But here the object is expressed, to go forth. Plainly then, they were confined before, as in a prison; and the gate of the prison was burst open, to set them free.Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Old Testament. London, Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. * \"their king\": \"the Breaker,\" peculiarly \"their king\" (Hosea 3:5; Matthew 27:37).Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown.
