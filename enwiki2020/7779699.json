    "text": "\"Love Won't Wait\" is a song by English singer Gary Barlow from his debut studio album Open Road. It was released as the second single from the album on 25 April 1997 by BMG and RCA Records. The song was written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone, and was an unreleased demo from her Bedtime Stories (1994) studio sessions. Barlow came by the demo in 1997, while looking to record more songs for Open Road. He changed the lyrics to represent a male point of view rather than Madonna's, and recorded the track with Stephen Lipson as producer. Barlow was apprehensive about releasing the track, but due to contractual obligations he had to release it. The song became Barlow's second consecutive number-one release on the UK Singles Chart, following \"Forever Love\", and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also reached number one in Spain and the top ten in Denmark, Ireland, Italy, and Taiwan. A music video for the song was directed by Rocky Schenck and showed Barlow singing \"Love Won't Wait\" across different locations. He also performed the song at the 1997 pre-Grammy Award party, where his performance was negatively received. ==Background== Following the release of her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992), Madonna and her producer Shep Pettibone continued writing more songs in the same vein as present in the album. However, she later abandoned the project and collaborated with record producers Dallas Austin and Nellee Hooper to create Bedtime Stories, her sixth studio album, released in 1994. Many of the songs from the writing sessions with Pettibone were not included and remained as demos. In the meantime, Gary Barlow wanted to release his debut album, Open Road, to coincide with his first single, \"Forever Love\". However, he wanted to continue recording songs for the album. He came across one of Madonna's demos called \"Love Won't Wait\" and decided to record it, after shortening the lyrics. Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson to produce the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he nevertheless explained in an interview: \"It took me a while to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'.\" A dance-pop song, \"Love Won't Wait\" is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C\u2013A\u2013B\u2013Cm in the pre-chorus and E\u2013B\u2013D\u2013A\u2013C\u2013E\u2013A\u2013Cm in the chorus. ==Release and promotion== Barlow had arrived in the United States in February 1997 for recording the track, where Clive Davis, who was managing his career in the United States, played him a \"poppier\" version of the song, remixed by Junior Vasquez. He also requested Barlow to perform \"Love Won't Wait\" at the 1997 pre-Grammy Award party. However, the singer did not have any time to rehearse or memorize the lyrics, resulting in the performance receiving negative reviews from critics and audience alike. With The Times Barlow recounted the evening saying, \"I don't remember the words. I came in at all the wrong times. I can see people drifting off to the toilet in droves. Talk about dying on your arse!\" The combination of the negative review towards his performance and contractual obligations led to Barlow release \"Love Won't Wait\" as his second single on 24 April 1997 in the United Kingdom. The CD single consisted of the single version along with the Vasquez remix and two other tracks from Open Road, \"Meaning Of A Love Song\" and \"Always\". Another song, \"Cuddly Toy\", was released on the B-side of another CD single for the song, released in May 1997. \"Love Won't Wait\" was also remixed by DJs Cuca and Monster Makers, and was released in a CD single in June 1997. An accompanying music video was directed by Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997. It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward. As he performs the chorus, he jumps off the set and walks towards his stage chair, where he sits and observes his surroundings. The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road, as the video fades from view. ==Critical and commercial reception== While the album received mostly negative reviews, songs like \"Love Won't Wait\" were considered a stand-out by The Times. The Daily Mirror noted it as a \"classic track you've known all your life\", while a reviewer from The Sunday Mirror rated it seven out of ten, and cautioned that \"Take That fans will lap up another smooth one from Gary, but I can't help thinking he's trying to turn into Elton John far too soon.\" In the United Kingdom, \"Love Won't Wait\" became Barlow's second solo number one single on the UK Singles Chart, following \"Forever Love\". It was number one for one week, and was present for a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it silver, for shipment of 200,000 copies of the single. The song also reached number one in Spain, and the top-ten of the charts in Denmark, Ireland and Taiwan. In Australia, \"Love Won't Wait\" peaked at number 16 on the ARIA Singles Chart. ==Track listing and formats== UK CD1 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:18 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Junior Vasquez Mix) \u2013 4:25 # \"Meaning of a Love Song\" \u2013 3:37 # \"Always\" \u2013 3:31 UK CD2 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:18 # \"Cuddly Toy\" (Lush Vocal Radio Edit) \u2013 3:44 # \"Cuddly Toy\" (Full On Retro Vocal) \u2013 8:51 # \"Cuddly Toy\" (Dumb & Funky Dub) \u2013 7:45 Cassette single / 7\" jukebox vinyl # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:18 # \"Always\" \u2013 3:31 The Remixes CD single # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Cuca's Club Mix) \u2013 7:27 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Cuca's Radio) \u2013 4:24 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Monster Makers Mix) \u2013 6:46 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Monster Makers Radio Mix) \u2013 4:13 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Cuca's Club Extended) \u2013 7:50 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Monster Makers Techno Mix) \u2013 7:05 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Cuca's At 188 Street) \u2013 7:23 # \"Love Won't Wait\" (Cuca's Pop Radio Mix) \u2013 4:38 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1997) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Denmark (Tracklisten) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |15 |- |- |- !scope=row|Hungary (Mahasz) |7 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi) |11 |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE) |1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Taiwan (IFPI) |2 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1997) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |65 |} ==Certifications== ==See also== *List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1990s *List of number-one singles of 1997 (Spain) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 songs Category:1997 singles Category:Bertelsmann Music Group singles Category:Gary Barlow songs Category:Music videos directed by Rocky Schenck Category:Number-one singles in Spain Category:RCA Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Stephen Lipson Category:Songs written by Madonna (entertainer) Category:Songs written by Shep Pettibone Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles ",
