Pronounced , his forename is derived from the name of Roman great antiquity origin. McFadden attended St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. He made substitute appearances in the semi- final and final of the Ulster Under-21 Football Championship in 2010. He then played in the final of the 2010 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship, which Donegal (managed by Jim McGuinness) narrowly lost to Dublin (managed by Jim Gavin). After being appointed senior manager in late-2010, McGuinness called McFadden into his squad ahead of the 2011 Dr McKenna Cup. Himself, Eamonn Doherty, James Carroll and Declan Walsh transferred to Boston for the summer in 2011. McFadden reached, and played in, the final of the 2011 Donegal Senior Football Championship \u2014 the first senior final in his club's history \u2014 but lost. His father has been a coach at the club. Antoin McFadden is the younger brother of Colm McFadden. There is a seven-year age difference. Also published as \"Colm Rain or Shine\" in the Donegal News of the same date, 19 March 2020: pp 50\u201353. \"Colm has one brother who was eight years older, and another who is seven years younger, so there wasn't the sibling rivalry that other families might have had\". Both McFaddens were part of the Donegal team that won the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, though Antoin did not play in the final. His brother, Colm, scored Donegal's second goal in the tenth minute and contributed four more points to the winning total. Antoin McFadden also has another brother, fifteen years his senior.
