M\u00e5rten Claesson, Eero Koivisto and Ola Rune met in 1992 as students at University College of Arts in Stockholm. The trio\u00b4s strong desire to connect space and objects inspired them to complement their studies from University College of Arts with architectural studies at Parsons School of Design in New York City, Schools of Architecture, Design and Conservation in Copenhagen and Aalto University in Helsinki. The office's work spans from private villas and luxury hotels to furniture, jewellery and cement tiles. Represented and produced in Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, UK, Uruguay and USA.
