The picture stars John Barrymore and features Dolores Costello in the frequently filmed story of Abbe Prevost's 1731 novel Manon Lescaut. The UK release title was His Lady. The film was the third feature from Warners to have a pre-recorded Vitaphone soundtrack. ==Plot== Chevalier Fabien des Grieux, who has forsworn the world for the church, falls passionately in love with young Manon Lescaut when he encounters her en route to a convent with her brother Andr\u00e9. The lustful Comte Guillot de Morfontaine offers Andr\u00e9 a tempting sum for Manon, and learning of their bargain, Fabien takes her to Paris, where they spend an idyllic week in a garret. Andr\u00e9 finds her, persuades her to leave Fabien, and tries to force her into an alliance with Morfontaine\u2014then rescues Manon from the advances of a brutal Apache. Fabien, crushed to believe that Manon has become Morfontaine's mistress, is about to take his vows but is deterred by her love for him. King Louis sees Manon in Richelieu's drawing room and wins her. The rejected Morfontaine orders her arrest and deportation, but he is killed by Fabien, who joins Manon on a convict ship bound for America. After inciting the convicts to mutiny, he escapes with her in a small boat. ==Cast== * John Barrymore as Chevalier Fabien des Grieux * Dolores Costello as Manon Lescaut * Warner Oland as Andr\u00e9 Lescaut * Sam De Grasse as Comte Guillot de Morfontaine * Holmes Herbert as Jean Tiberge * Stuart Holmes as Louis XV, King of France * Bertram Grassby as Le Duc de Richelieu * Tom Santschi as Captain of convict boat * Marcelle Corday as Marie, a servant * Charles Clary as a lay brother * Templar Saxe as Baron Chevral * Eugenie Besserer as the landlady * Rose Dione as Nana * Noble Johnson as an Apache * Tom Wilson as convict aboard the boat * Myrna Loy as woman on ship *Source: ==See also== * List of early Warner Bros. sound and talking features * John Barrymore filmography ==Production== When a Man Loves re-teamed Barrymore and Costello after 1925's The Sea Beast. The film is the third and last film in Barrymore's first Warners contract, having been preceded by The Sea Beast and Don Juan. He and director Alan Crosland re- teamed at United Artists to make The Beloved Rogue, another French costume story that was selected because of the popularity of When a Man Loves. This film version of When a Man Loves repeats the ending of The Sea Beast, providing a happy ending rather than the tragic ending of the source material.Norden, Martin (1995) John Barrymore, A Bio-bibliography Greenwood. Many of the people who worked on the previous year's Don Juan worked on When a Man Loves, such as director Crosland, writer Bess Meredyth, editor Harold McCord, and director of photography Byron Haskin.American Film Institute (1971) The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30 ==Response== When the film played in the theater, the audience was so amazed that the sound was coming from the speakers, not from an actual live orchestra. A New York Times reviewer wrote that he, and probably the rest of the audience, forgot the fact that there was actually no orchestra in the theater. At the end of the film, The Vitaphone Symphony Orchestra was shown to the audience for about 15 seconds. ===Box office=== According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $732,000 in the U.S. and $305,000 in other markets.Warner Bros financial information in The William Shaefer Ledger.
