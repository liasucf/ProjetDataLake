Some Instagram users use the app to spread positivity to others, and in doing so, they themselves are left feeling happier. Not only does positivity in social media affect the person being encouraged through comments, but also the person writing the encouraging comments. According to the research recorded by Dan Zarella, the more positive a person is on social media, the more followers they will get because \"users become less engaged when content on their feed becomes more negative\" (Lee 1). So, when someone posts a lot of positive things, it makes people want to be a part of their social media presence. People on social media seek out positivity. ==See also== * List of biases in judgment and decision making * List of memory biases *Optimism bias *Pollyanna principle *Positivity offset *Rosy retrospection * Self-serving bias * Wishful thinking ==Notes== ==References== ===Dictionaries and encyclopedias=== * * ===Papers=== * * * Category:Cognition Category:Cognitive biases Category:Memory Category:Memory biases Category:Psychological theories ",
