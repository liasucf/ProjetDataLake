In their first season under head coach Larry Smith, the Wildcats compiled a 5\u20136 record (3\u20134 against Pac-10 opponents), finished in a tie for sixth place in the Pac-10, and were outscored by their opponents, 275 to 215. The team played its home games in Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. The team's statistical leaders included Tom Tunnicliffe with 1,204 passing yards, Hubert Oliver with 655 rushing yards, and Tim Holmes with 545 receiving yards. Linebacker Jack Housley led the team with 104 total tackles.2016 Media Guide, p. 86. ==Before the season== Arizona finished the 1979 season with a 6\u20135 record, and lost to Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl. During the offseason, head coach Tony Mason was discovered as being allegedly involved in a cash payment scandal by giving boosters money to players, which was illegal under NCAA rules. As a result, Mason was fired and replaced by Smith, who was coaching at Tulane. Smith was a former assistant coach at Arizona under Mason\u2019s predecessor Jim Young. In a press conference, Smith promised to rebuild the program and bring the team to a winning success. ==Schedule== ==Game summaries== ===at Iowa=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20132 | 1978 | W 23\u20133 |} ===Notre Dame=== Notre Dame took down the Wildcats in their first and, to date, only trip to Tucson. ===UCLA=== Arizona upset the second-ranked Bruins for Smith\u2019s first big win as the Wildcat coach (UCLA was set to become the top-ranked team had they won). ===Arizona State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 29\u201324 | 1979 | W 27\u201324 |} ==Season notes== *Smith\u2019s first season was known as a \u201crebuilding year\u201c, leading to the team\u2019s 5\u20136 record. *The season was the only one in the 1980s that Arizona finished with a losing record. *Also, this season started a decade of resurgence for the Wildcats, fulfilling Smith\u2019s promise when he was hired before the season started (see above). *The victory over UCLA was the first big win under Smith, which became overshadowed by Arizona\u2019s upset of USC during the following season. *Arizona did not lose to ASU at home again until 1992. *This was the last season until 2012 that Arizona wore red helmets and also the last season until 2005 that they wore red jerseys. ==References== Arizona Category:Arizona Wildcats football seasons Arizona Wildcats football team ",
