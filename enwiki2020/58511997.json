(high-resolution expandable photo) Amarna letter EA 59, titled: \"From the Citizens of Tunip\"Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters. EA 59, \"From the Citizens of Tunip\", pp. 130-131. is a short-, to moderate-length clay tablet Amarna letter from the city-state of Tunip, written to the Pharaoh of Egypt. Only one other city sent a clay tablet Amarna letter to the Pharaoh, namely Irqata (modern Arqa), letter EA 100, titled: \"The City of Irqata to the King\". The EA 59 letter concerns the \"watch-guarding\" of Tunip, regional warfare (with the Habiru), and the city's continued protection, and loyalty to the Egyptian Pharaoh. EA 59 is located at the British Museum, no BM 29824.
