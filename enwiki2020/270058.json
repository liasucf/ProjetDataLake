    "text": "Henry Philibert Gaspard Darcy (, 10 June 1803 \u2013 3 January 1858) was a French engineer who made several important contributions to hydraulics including Darcy\u2019s law for flow in porous media. ==Early life== Darcy was born in Dijon, France, on June 10, 1803. His first given name is Henry; although the French spelling Henri appears in multiple sources such as necrological notices, Darcy used the Anglicized spelling. Despite his father's death in 1817 when he was 14, his mother was able to borrow money to pay for his tutors. In 1821 he enrolled at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (Polytechnic School) in Paris, and transferred two years later to the School of Bridges and Roads, which led to employment in the Corps of Bridges and Roads. Darcy met an English woman, Henriette Carey, whose family had been living in Dijon, and married her in 1828. ==Engineering career== Darcy's bust in the Jardin Darcy, Dijon As a member of the Corps, he built an impressive pressurized water distribution system in Dijon following the failure of attempts to supply adequate fresh water by drilling wells. The system carried water from Rosoir Spring away through a covered aqueduct (watercourse) to reservoirs near the city, which then fed into a network of 28,000 meters of pressurized pipes delivering water to much of the city. The system was fully closed and driven by gravity, and thus required no pumps with just sand acting as a filter. He was also involved in many other public works in and around Dijon, as well as in the politics of the Dijon city government. During this period he modified the Prony equation for calculating head loss due to friction, which after further modification by Julius Weisbach would become the well-known Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation still in use today. In 1848 he became Chief Engineer for the d\u00e9partement of which Dijon is the capital. Soon thereafter he left Dijon due to political pressure, but was promoted to Chief Director for Water and Pavements and took up office in Paris. While in that position, he was able to focus more on his hydraulics research, especially on flow and friction losses in pipes. During this period he improved the design of the Pitot tube, into essentially the form used today. He resigned his post in 1855 due to poor health, but was permitted to continue his research in Dijon. In 1855 and 1856 he conducted column experiments that established what has become known as Darcy's law; initially developed to describe flow through sands, it has since been generalized to a variety of situations and is in widespread use today. The unit of measure of material permeability, the darcy is named in his honour. Darcy died of pneumonia while on a trip to Paris in 1858, and is buried in Cimeti\u00e8re de Dijon (formerly known as P\u00e9joces) in Dijon. == Publications == Place Darcy, Dijon, named after Henry Darcy * * * * == See also == * Hydrogeology == References == * gives a great deal of biographical detail for Darcy, including his publications, along with a detailed and informed discussion of the history of Darcy's law. * == External links == Category:1803 births Category:1858 deaths Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Corps des ponts Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni Category:Fluid dynamicists Category:French civil engineers Category:French hydrologists Category:Hydraulic engineers Category:People from Dijon ",
