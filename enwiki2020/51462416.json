Due to variations in the local languages (Tamil, Kannada, Telugu) and dialects, the temple is also referred to as 'Chandira Choodeshwarar', 'Chandra Choodeshwara', 'Chandra Choodeshwar', 'Shri Choodeswarar' or 'Arulmigu ChandraChoodeshwarar'. The main deities of the temple are Shiva, depicted as the Shiva linga and the Goddess Parvati, depicted as 'Maragathambal'. ==Names of the main deities== 'Chandra Choodeswarar' means the Eshwara who wears the Moon (Chandra) as an ornament on his crest or tuft of hair on top of the head. Shiva's consort Parvathi is worshiped here as Maragathambal. \u2018Maragatham\u2019 means green and \u2018Ambal\u2019 means mother. This is in reference to the green plants and trees (Photosynthesis), which provide sustenance to all living beings. ==Temple history== In the 10th century, Hosur was known as Chevidapadi, and in the 13th century, Hosur was known as Murasunadu, from 16th century onwards, it is been called as Hosur. The exact history of the temple is not clearly documented. Considering that the Hosur region is mentioned in ancient Hindu texts like the 'Padmagiri Mahathyamam', a part of 'Bramanda Puranam', a shrine for Shiva is deemed to have existed here from ancient times. The temple has grown during the time of the Cholas, Hoysala and Vijayanagara Emperors. The Chandra choodeshwara Temple structure may have been built by the Hoysala king, Thirupuvanamalla Barvatharaja Anthiyazhvar, in the year 1260.
