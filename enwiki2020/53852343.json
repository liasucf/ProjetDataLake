In this second edition of the competition, which faced Jugoplastika, champions of the 1988\u201389 FIBA European Champions Cup, and Real Madrid, champions of the 1988\u201389 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup, was due to take place on 26 September and on 3 October 1989, but finally was suspended and not organized by the late appearance of Jugoplastika, claiming the Yugoslav club was unwilling to make an economic effort for the trip (despite A month earlier to play the ACEB International Tournament), for a competition still young, so that Real Madrid (who was willing to play) would be proclaimed champion for the final appearance of the rival, although the tournament was suspended and not recorded in FIBA competitions, and Real Madrid was never given officially the trophy. ==References== 1989 Category:1989\u201390 in European basketball Category:1989\u201390 in Spanish basketball Category:1989\u201390 in Yugoslav basketball Category:International basketball competitions hosted by Spain Category:International basketball competitions hosted by Yugoslavia Category:International basketball competitions hosted by Croatia Category:Cancelled sports events ",
