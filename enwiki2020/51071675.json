The club and John's defining season came during the 1923-24 campaign when they won four domestic trophies (Irish League championship, Irish Cup, City Cup and County Antrim Shield). During his impressive season, Gough was selected to represent Ireland against South Africa in a friendly game at Solitude in September 1924. This was the South African's first ever official international game. The full cap added to the two caps he had won between 1923 and 1924 for the Irish League representative teamIrish League Greats - Irish League Representatives 1893-2007 Queen's Island's success quickly deteriorated and in September 1928, John left the club to join the newly elected Ballymena team.Coleman, N. (2015). The Official History of Ballymena United FC. Ballyhay Books. It proved a shrewd decision as Gough won another Irish Cup winners' medal in 1929, as the Braidmen defeated Belfast Celtic in final in their first ever season. He was also part of the team for a return to the Irish Cup final a year later, as Ballymena were defeated by Linfield. John Gough was not retained by the Ballymena selection committee during the summer of 1930. It is unclear if he continued to play competitive football after his release. He returned to Ballymena in an off-field role 1934 as he formed part of the Management Committee of the new Ballymena United club which had been formed following the sudden demise the old club. ==Club honours== Queen's Island *Irish League winner (1): 1923-24 *Irish Cup winner (1): 1923-24 *City Cup winner (3): 1922-23, 1923\u201324, 1924-1925 *County Antrim Shield winner (1): 1923-24 *Irish League runner-up (3): 1922-23, 1924\u201325, 1926\u201327 Ballymena *Irish Cup winner (1): 1928\u201329 *Irish Cup runner-up (1): 1929\u201330 *City Cup runner-up (1): 1928\u201329 ==International caps== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
