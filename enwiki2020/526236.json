This is based on an interpretation of .\"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him\".

The function ascribed to erelim in and in Jewish folkloreLouis Ginzberg: Legends of the Jews 5:23, n. 64; 5:417, n. 117 is not consistent with the lore surrounding the thrones. Thrones are sometimes equated with ophanim since the throne of God is usually depicted as being moved by wheels, as in the vision of (Old Testament).
