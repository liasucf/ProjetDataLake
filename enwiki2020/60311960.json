At the start of the 17th-century, by order of the Grand- Duke Ferdinand I, a venerated icon of the Madonna was moved to this church; it had previously been housed in a small chapel on the bridge of Santa Maria. In 1605, an elegantly coffered and painted wooden ceiling was installed by Giovanni Zeti. The interior was decorated by Domenico Marcacci, with an altarpiece added by Alessandro Tiarini.Comune of Pescia itinerary including church. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Pescia Category:14th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Renaissance architecture in Tuscany ",
