    "text": "Bottema's theorem construction; changing the location of vertex C changes the locations of vertices E and F but does not change the location of their midpoint M Bottema's theorem is a theorem in plane geometry by the Dutch mathematician Oene Bottema (Groningen, 1901\u20131992). The theorem can be stated as follows: in any given triangle ABC, construct squares on any two adjacent sides, for example AC and BC. The midpoint of the line segment that connects the vertices of the squares opposite the common vertex, C, of the two sides of the triangle is independent of the location of C.. The theorem is true when the squares are constructed in one of the following ways: *Looking at the figure, starting from the lower left vertex, A, follow the triangle vertices clockwise and construct the squares to the left of the sides of the triangle. *Follow the triangle in the same way and construct the squares to the right of the sides of the triangle. ==See also== * Van Aubel's theorem * Napoleon's theorem ==References== ==External links== * Bottema's Theorem: What Is It? * Wolfram Demonstrations Project \u2013 Bottema's Theorem Category:Theorems in plane geometry ",
