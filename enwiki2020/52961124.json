    "text": "Benny Alba (born May 7, 1949) in Columbus, Ohio, is an artist who lives in Oakland, California. == Early life and career == Alba's great grandmother was an oil painter and her grandmother trained as a concert pianist. Alba's mother, Marjorie, held a Master of Fine Arts degree in ceramics from Ohio State University, teaching at Ohio State University Academy. Alba's father, an engineer, was an inventor and CEO of Oasis (also known as Ebco), a Fortune 500 company. Art was an important topic in her childhood home. During high school, Alba artist attended classes at Columbus Cultural Arts Center, part of the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department. Alba also studied at Penland School of Arts and Crafts summer program attending lithography and silk screening classes. After high school, Alba traveled a summer with her Mother to Europe, where they visited museums and architectural sites in Germany and Italy. Alba then began her studies at Kent State University, with a focus on English literature. While there she witnessed the shootings at Kent State, and soon after left the University and her studies to live in Berkeley, California. Six years later Alba enrolled in University of Michigan, earning a Bachelor of Psychology. During this period she began working in studio on a daily basis, starting as an abstract painter. Alba regularly organized artist groups for figure drawing sessions for years, along with a consciousness raising feminist group. She organized group exhibitions and began entering juried shows. In 1984 Alba moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area to immerse herself in the rich mixture of cultures. ==Major painting series== Alba's earliest interest was in printmaking \u2013 linocuts, lithography, and etching. Painting as her primary focus started while attending University of Michigan as a Psychology major. Exploring abstraction and color fields her work then moved to symbolism; a trend that continued for decades. Later on, Alba shifted to landscapes, with increasing focus on the sky as subject. Her work over these four decades can be categorized into several major bodies of work: :Old and New World (1980s) \u2013 A series of paintings and prints that speaks to the intermingling \u2013 rather than homogenization \u2013 of US cultures, including an awareness of Native American rights, and the importance of Native American thoughts and beliefs regarding North America as well as feminism :Alaska Journey (2000s) \u2013 Landscapes sourced from a drive trip through Canada to Alaska. This series marks the artist's shift from symbolism to landscape as an exclusive topic. The series includes paintings and prints. :Beauty, Thy Name is Night (installation, 2007 \u2013 2010) \u2013 Oil paintings depicting night often exhibited in near total darkness. Quotes by notable authors and philosophers describing night above and below were written in white chalk on flat black painted drops installed on walls. Imagery included tree silhouettes and the moon in various stages of its monthly cycle. Viewers were supplied with flashlights to seek out the quotes. :American Storms (2010 \u2013 current) \u2013 These are oil paintings of extreme winter storm weather experienced by the artist while delivering solo shows cross-country. Painted on canvas or paper, a few are large format of 10 to 14 feet wide. == Later career == Upon her move to California, Alba joined Apprentice Alliance, as Master teacher/artist in the San Francisco-based organization training apprentices for more than three decades. Alba frequently donated workshops on photographing artworks for art groups. Alba has sponsored poetry readings and musical events at her art exhibitions in museum and gallery solo shows. A decades-long collaboration between poetess Cynthia Harris and Alba included presentations together at Cody's Books in Berkeley, Jack London Square's Barnes & Noble Bookstore in Oakland, CA, as well as Alba's museum solo in Minnesota's North County Museum of Arts. For over 20 years, she hosted over two dozen guest artists as part of PRO ARTS East Bay Open Studios, an annual citywide public art event. Alba has presented as a lecturer, served as guest speaker, and juried multiple exhibits throughout her career. She also serves on the boards of several art-related organizations. Following her move to California, she joined the local branch of the Women's Caucus for the Arts. After being juried into The California Society of Printmakers, Alba rose from artist member to board member and finally served as President 2003 - 2006. In 2010, the Oakland City Crafts and Cultural Arts Gallery held a retrospective of Alba's works. This made visible many of the artistic influences over Alba's career \u2013 including works influenced by abstraction, symbolism, psychology, anthropology, archaeology, surrealism, and feminism. Alba remains active, with solo exhibitions, teaching apprentices, public speaking, jurying exhibitions and judging awards, as well as serving as guest speaker. == Exhibitions == Alba's first group show was in Ohio at the Columbus Cultural Arts Center in 1980. Her first solo exhibition was the following year in the Loft Gallery at the same venue. Her first solo in California was in the Canessa Gallery in San Francisco. She has had over 100 solo exhibitions throughout the Commonwealth Club of California since then and participated in over 300 group shows in the US.
