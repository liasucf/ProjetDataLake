It was built in 1825 and has been in the same family since 1839.Hexenlochm\u00fchle at www.hexenlochmuehle.de. Retrieved 2 Apr 2018. It is the only mill in the Black Forest with two water wheels. In 1825, the part with the smaller water wheel was built as a nail smithy. Later, the part with the larger water wheel was built as a sawmill. Eventually the nail smithy was turned into a workshop for the clockmaking works. The mill and restaurant are open daily all year round, except for 2 weeks in March. == References == == External links == * Hexenlochm\u00fchle * Andorf's Schwarzwaldf\u00fchrer * Spiegel Online: Schwarzwald Im Tal der nie aufgehenden Sonne Category:Black Forest Category:Watermills in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis ",
