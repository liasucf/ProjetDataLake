The EP title is a quote from the introductory track on their previous album Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes, as well as the band name's permanent abbreviation. The EP includes two original songs and two covers. In November 2010, Adeline Records released a special edition pressing on purple vinyl, limited to 500 copies. It is the first release to mention Hunter Burgan as a permanent member, and the last to feature guitarist Mark Stopholese. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from liner notes. * AFI \u2013 producer * Joe Brook \u2013 band photos * Hunter Burgan \u2013 bass * Adam Carson \u2013 drums * Andy Earnst \u2013 recording, mixing * Tedd Francis \u2013 lyric art * Davey Havok \u2013 vocals * John Joh \u2013 re-design * Markus Stopholese \u2013 guitar * Luke Ogden \u2013 fire photo * Jamie Reilly \u2013 layout * Jim Thiebaud \u2013 layout ;Studios * Recorded at The Art of Ears, Hayward, CA * Mastered at Oceanview Digital Mastering, LA, CA ==References== Category:1998 EPs Category:AFI (band) EPs Category:Adeline Records EPs ",
