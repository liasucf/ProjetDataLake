Romero, a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), held the position of Governor of Jalisco from 1977 to 1983. Romero was inaugurated on March 1, 1977. One of Governor Romero's first priorities was a crack down on left-wing guerillas, who were active in Jalisco during the 1970s. Under Romero, the state government launched Sistecozome, the bus public transportation system for the city of Guadalajara in 1982. Romero also renovated much of Guadalajara's city center, which culminated with the construction and opening of the city's large Plaza Tapatia, also in 1982, although such process involved the demolition of most of the historical buildings from the Spanish colonial epoch. On January 23, 1998, Romero was arrested and charged with aiding drug trafficking. Romero denied the charges and accused the then-President Ernesto Zedillo of being behind his arrest due to a political vendetta. Romero was released from prison on July 14, 2001, and later acquitted due to lack of evidence. Flavio Romero de Velasco died on July 2, 2016, at the age of 90. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Governors of Jalisco Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Politicians from Jalisco Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:Mexican lawyers Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni Category:People from Ameca, Jalisco ",
