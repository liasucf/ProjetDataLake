    "text": "Revolution of 1904 was a civic-military revolt led by Aparicio Saravia against the government of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in the Banda Oriental. It was the last military conflict between Blancos and Colorados. == History == It was the bloodiest of the revolutions that occurred in the Banda Oriental, with large numbers of casualties and injuries on both sides. On June 6, 1904, took place the Battle of Guayabos (Salto Department), in which the saravista colonel Abelardo M\u00e1rquez, was defeated by government troops. In the Battle of Tupamba\u00e9, General Aparicio Saravia faced the troops of General Pablo Galarza in the department of Cerro Largo. Saravia was wounded during the Battle of Masoller, and died several days later in Santana do Livramento, Brazil. The armistice was signed on September 24, 1904. Several sons of Aparicio Saravia fought in the ranks of the revolutionary army. His brother Basilicio Saravia, served in the government army. ==Gallery== File:Saravia Aparicio.jpg|last photograph of General Aparicio Saravia, taken during the 1904 Revolution File:Revolucionarios saravistas.jpg|Rebel patrols in the streets of Melo File:Coronel Manuel Macedo.jpg|Colonel Manuel Macedo Fuli\u00e1o, and sons during the Revolution of 1904 File:Pr\u00e1ctica de tiro de fuerzas saravistas en 1904.jpg|shooting practice of Saravistas forces File:Intervencion quirurgica al aire libre en la revoluci\u00f3n de 1904.jpg|Campaign Hospital of the National Party File:Coronel Jos\u00e9 F.
