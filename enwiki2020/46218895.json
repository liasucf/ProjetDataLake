Robotic Empire streamed Circa Survive's cover of \"Drain You\" along with the album's announcement on March 25, 2015. == Song information == === Drain You === Circa Survive guitarist Brendan Ekstrom commented on their cover, stating: \"There are different ways to approach covering a band. For us, doing a Nirvana song takes us back to a very raw place that we were in when we were young and just falling in love with music. We didn't want to say 'here's what this song would've sounded like if Circa wrote it.' It was way more fun for us to live in their energy and pay homage to their influence by just rocking the shit out of it and keeping it raw.\" == Track listing == == References == == External links == * Whatever Nevermind at Bandcamp Category:2015 compilation albums Category:Robotic Empire compilation albums Category:Nirvana (band) tribute albums Category:Record Store Day releases ",
