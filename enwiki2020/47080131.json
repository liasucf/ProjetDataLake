He graduated from Middlebury College in 1824 before moving to New York City. Battell's sister, Irene Battell, married Yale professor William Augustus Larned. Battell was an enthusiast of sacred music and established a fund at Yale for it in 1854. This gift was the first towards an eventual School of Music, officially founded in 1890. He later gave $30,000 to fund the construction of Battell Chapel, completed in 1876, and willed Yale an additional $50,000 to ensure its completion. Battell died in Brooklyn, New York on July 8, 1874. ==References== Category:1806 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:American businesspeople Category:People from Norfolk, Connecticut Category:Yale University people ",
