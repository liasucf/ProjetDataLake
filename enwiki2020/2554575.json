The species was first described by Christian Friedrich Freyer in 1845. ==Technical description and variation== It is like Luperina testacea, but olive grey, without any rufous tinge; inner and outer lines conversely edged with whitish; a blackish shade before inner line from median vein to inner margin, interrupted at vein 1; claviform stigma broadly blackish; orbicular a minute white spot; reniform subquadrate, with fuscous centre and broad white annulus, the area beyond it blackish, submarginal line whiter, preceded, except between veins 6 and 7, by a blackish shade; a row of neat black marginal lunules; fringe dark grey pencilled with light grey; hindwing pure white, with dark marginal lunules and white fringe; the veins dark.

(2003). Field Guide to the Moths of Great Britain and Ireland. Hook: British Wildlife Publishing. ===Subspecies demuthi=== Found on the coasts of Kent, Essex and Suffolk ===Subspecies gueneei=== Found in coastal sandhills in North Wales and Lancashire ===Subspecies leechi=== Subspecies leechi, is found on Loe Bar, Cornwall, the shingle beach which separates Loe Pool from the sea. Two pupae, found in the sand, by Barry Goater and Michael Leech in September 1974 was the first sign of this previously unknown subspecies.Smith, F.H.N. (1997) The Moths and Butterflies of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Wallingford: Gem Publishing Company. The female moth is reluctant to fly and rarely appears at light; behaviour that has presumably evolved as an adaptation to its windswept habitat. With only one known population ssp. leechi is a Biodiversity Action Plan species, is listed in the Red Data Book and a species account is given in the Cornish RDB.Spalding, A., Truscott, L.A.C. & Worth, J. (2009) Moths and Butterflies. In CISBFR, Red Data Book for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2nd Edition. Praze-an-Beeble: Croceago Press. ==Biology== The larvae feed on the stem and roots of sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) from September to the following July.Porter J. (1997) The Colour Identification Guide to Caterpillars of the British Isles. London: Penguin Group. ==The sandhill rustic in Ireland== In Ireland, the sandhill rustic is represented by the subspecies knilli, which occurs only in County Kerry. ==References== ==External links== * * Taxonomy *Fauna Europaea *Site dedicated to the sandhill rustic *Arkive page on the sandhill rustic *Lepiforum e.V.
