    "text": "Otto Georg Schily (born 20 July 1932) was Federal Minister of the Interior of Germany from 1998 to 2005, in the cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). ==Early life and education== Born in Bochum as the son of an iron works director, Schily grew up in a family of anthroposophists. His younger brother is Konrad Schily, an academic and also a politician. They spent their adolescence during the war in Bavaria. The family opposed Adolf Hitler.Roger Cohen (December 29, 1998), Schroder Aide Typifies New German Subtlety New York Times. In 1962, he passed his second state exam after having studied law and politics in Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin, thus being admitted to the bar; a year later, he opened his own law practice. On 2 June 1967 Schily went to a demonstration in Berlin against the violation of human rights in Iran. A student, Benno Ohnesorg, was shot dead by the police. He subsequently decided to represent the student's family.Roger Cohen (December 29, 1998), Schroder Aide Typifies New German Subtlety New York Times. In the 1970s, he became a public figure as a trial lawyer, defending several guerrilla activists of the left-wing Red Army Faction. In 1971, he represented his friend Horst Mahler (who much later would become an advocate of the fascist National Democratic Party); during the Stammheim trial (1975\u20131977), he was the only remaining attorney of Gudrun Ensslin. While he gained popularity and respect for acting according to his own moral principles, some accused him of supporting the radicals' goals. ==Political career== ===Founding member of the Green Party=== Petra Kelly and Otto Schily after the 1983 federal election In 1980, Schily became founding member of the Green Party. In 1982, he joined other members of the Green Party for a meeting with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who offered to help groups allied with the European anti-nuclear movement to try to close United States military bases in Europe.John Vinocur (July 27, 1982), Qaddafi Urges Europeans to Try to Shut U.S. Bases New York Times. In the 1983 elections, Schily was elected to the German Bundestag and in the first electoral term in which the Greens were represented in parliament, he was one of the spokespersons of the parliamentary group, together with Petra Kelly and Marieluise Beck. In parliament, he became a leading exponent of the party's realist wing, which favored striving for a governing coalition with the Social Democrats following the 1987 elections. In 1986, he was the Greens' sole representative on a Bundestag committee investigating the so-called Flick affair.James M. Markham (February 23, 1986), Suddenly, Kohl Is On the Defensive New York Times. Due to the party's policy of rotating its representatives, he had to leave parliament in 1986, but he was re-elected in 1987. ===Switch to the Social Democrats=== Increasingly estranged from the fundamentalist wing of the Greens, particularly regarding alliances with larger parties, Schily left the party in 1989, resigned his seat in parliament, and joined the Social Democrats (SPD) instead - which he represented in the new Bundestag in 1990. In subsequent years, he was active in affairs of the former East Germany and in coordinating various legal policies of the SPD. Between 1994 and 1998, Schily served on the Committee on the Election of Judges (Wahlausschuss), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. He was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG). ===Federal Minister of the Interior, 1998\u20132005=== After Gerhard Schr\u00f6der became chancellor in 1998, he appointed Schily as Federal Minister of the Interior. He was the oldest member of the cabinet. During his time in office, Schily was frequently criticized for conservative policies, such as pushing through German anti-terrorist legislation after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, which were seen as contradictory to his earlier beliefs. Under the new legislation, his ministry moved against Metin Kaplan\u2019s radical Islamic group in December 2001, banning it and 19 associated organizations and carrying out more than 200 raids in seven cities.Steven Erlanger (December 13, 2001), Germany, Under New Antiterrorist Law, Bans a Radical Muslim Group New York Times. Between 2001 and 2004, Schily led the government\u2019s negotiations with the conservative opposition on a bill that made it easier for skilled workers to move to Germany but toughened controls on foreign militants.Steven Erlanger (December 13, 2001), Germany: Agreement On Immigration Bill New York Times. In 2004, he joined Italy in proposing the creation of the camps, possibly in Libya, to process potential immigrants and repatriate illegal arrivals to the EU.Hugh Williamson (September 30, 2004), Migrants' camps idea draws scorn on minister Financial Times. In 2001, the parliamentary opposition called for Schily\u2019s resignation in light of revelations that his ministry had failed to inform the Federal Constitutional Court that a key witness in the government\u2019s petition to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) had worked as an undercover agent for the domestic intelligence service; the failure to notify the court later resulted in the suspension of the proceedings.Kirsten Grieshaber (June 18, 2004), Otto Schily Refuses to Resign over NPD Case Deutsche Welle, January 25, 2002. In 2005, Schily again came under pressure for authorizing a raid on the newsroom of Cicero magazine after it had published information from a secret Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) report.Freedom of the Press: Germany - 2006 Country Report Freedom House. On 29 March 2007, Schily took responsibility for the handling of the case of Guantanamo detainee Murat Kurnaz, who was arrested in Pakistan in 2001, turned over to U.S. authorities and held at the U.S. prison camp in Cuba as a terror suspect. Kurnaz was released in 2006 and returned to Germany.\"Ex- Interior Minister Takes Political Responsibility for Kurnaz Case\" Deutsche Welle March 29, 2007. Accessed March 1, 2010 Following the 2005 elections and the formation of the new government of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Schily was succeeded in his post by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Schily remained a member of parliament until 2009 and served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 2008, he caused headlines when the German Bundestag on 22 April fined him \u20ac22,000 for failing to disclose the names of his law firm\u2019s clients.Bundestag\u2019s Schily fine gives Kallas a boost European Voice, April 30, 2008. ==Life after politics== After serving as a minister, Schily became a supervisory board member of two companies for biometric technologies, raising questions as to whether or not he was capitalizing on his work as minister, regarding the implementation of biometric passports.\"Germany Introduces Biometric Passports\", Deutsche Welle. January 1, 2005. Accessed March 1, 2010\"Schily Season\" Weekly Standard, March 29, 2004.

Accessed March 1, 2010 Between 2006 and 2007, Schily served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters. In 2015, Schily was accused of receiving money to lobby for the prosecution in Austria of Rakhat Aliyev, a former Kazakh official who turned against the Kazakh government.Damien McGuinness (June 17, 2015), Germany's Koehler and Schroeder reject Kazakh lobby claims BBC News.
