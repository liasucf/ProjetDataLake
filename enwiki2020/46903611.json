Starting his career with Sport Recife, Joelinton joined Hoffenheim in 2015, and was loaned to Rapid Wien for two years from 2016. He has also been capped for the Brazil under-17 national team. ==Club career== ===Sport Recife=== Born in Alian\u00e7a, Pernambuco, Joelinton joined Sport Recife in 2012 and spent two years playing in the youth team. He was promoted to the senior squad in 2013, but it was not until March 2014 that he made his professional debut, in a Copa do Nordeste match against city rivals Santa Cruz. He came on as a 62nd-minute substitute for Neto Baiano in the 2\u20131 away semi-final win (4\u20131 aggregate). Sport won the cup with a 3\u20131 aggregate win over Cear\u00e1 in the final; Joelinton did not play. He was on the bench six times in the Campeonato Pernambucano season, which they also won. In the 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A season, Joelinton made seven appearances towards the end of the campaign. He scored his first career goal on 23 November in a 2\u20132 home draw with Fluminense, and on the last day he scored the only goal against S\u00e3o Paulo after four minutes. Joelinton established himself in the first team in the 2015 state league. However, he received two straight red cards in the second phase, against Santa Cruz and N\u00e1utico. ===Hoffenheim=== In June 2015, Hoffenheim signed Joelinton on a five-year contract. He played only once in his first season in Germany, as a last-minute substitute for Jonathan Schmid in a 1\u20130 loss at Schalke 04 on 18 December. ====Loan to Rapid Wien==== Salzburg's Igor in September 2017 On 23 June 2016, Joelinton was loaned to Rapid Wien for two years. He made his debut on 8 July in the first round of the Austrian Cup against Regionalliga Ost club FC Karabakh Wien, scoring the opening goal of a 3\u20131 victory. In the semi-finals on 26 April 2017, he scored an added-time winner at home to LASK Linz as Die Gr\u00fcn-Wei\u00dfen reached the final for the first time in 12 years. He equalised in the final at the Worthersee Stadion on 1 June, but FC Red Bull Salzburg won 2\u20131. Joelinton played all ten of Rapid's 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League matches, scoring in a 3\u20132 win over Genk on 15 September and a 1\u20131 draw with Athletic Bilbao at the Allianz Stadion on 8 December. On the domestic front in the Austrian Football Bundesliga, he recorded 8 goals in 33 games \u2013 including one to cap a 4\u20131 victory at city rivals FK Austria Wien on 7 August \u2013 but the Viennese club finished 5th of 10 teams and missed out on European football. On 22 July 2017, the first game of the new season, Joelinton was sent off after 23 minutes in a 2\u20132 home draw with SV Mattersburg, for kicking back after being fouled by Michael Novak. ====Return==== On his return to Hoffenheim, Joelinton was given a first start in a DFB-Pokal first round match at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, and scored a hat- trick in a 6\u20131 victory. He netted his first Bundesliga goal on 22 September to open a 1\u20131 home draw with Borussia Dortmund, and as a substitute on 23 October he scored an added-time equaliser for a 3\u20133 draw against Lyon in a Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. ===Newcastle United=== On 23 July 2019, Joelinton joined Newcastle United on a six-year deal for a reported club record fee of \u00a340 million. He made his debut on 11 August, starting in their 1\u20130 home loss to Arsenal; he and teammate Miguel Almir\u00f3n were criticised by the club's all-time record scorer Alan Shearer for their performances. Joelinton scored his first Premier League goal on 25 August in a 1\u20130 victory away at Tottenham Hotspur. It took him until 14 January 2020 to score his second goal for the club, netting the final goal in a 4\u20131 FA Cup Third Round replay victory over Rochdale. Joelinton went on to score his first brace for the club in a 7-0 thrashing of Morecambe in the EFL cup on 23 September 2020. ==International career== Joelinton was capped four times by the Brazil under-17 national team in 2012, scoring two goals. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club!!rowspan=2|Season!!colspan=3|League!!colspan=2|Cup!!colspan=2|Other!!colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Sport Recife||2014||rowspan=2|S\u00e9rie A |7||2||1||0||1||0||9||2 |- |2015 |5||1||5||1||20||3||30||5 |- !colspan=2|Total !12!!3!!6!!1!!21!!3!!39!!7 |- |rowspan=3|Hoffenheim||2015\u201316||rowspan=2|Bundesliga |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2018\u201319 |28||7||2||3||5||1||33||11 |- !colspan=2|Total !29!!7!!2!!3!!5!!1!!34!!11 |- |rowspan=3|SK Rapid Wien (loan)||2016\u201317||rowspan=2|Austrian Bundesliga |33||8||5||3||10||2||48||13 |- |2017\u201318 |27||7||4||1||0||0||31||8 |- !colspan=2|Total !60!!15!!9!!4!!10!!2!!79!!21 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Newcastle United |2019\u201320 |Premier League |38||2||6||2||0||0||44||4 |- |2020\u201321 |Premier League |5||0||2||2||0||0||7||2 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !43!!2!!6!!2!!1!!2!!51!!6 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career totals !144!!27!!23!!10!!37!!8!!203!!45 |} ==Honours== Sport Recife *Campeonato Pernambucano: 2014 *Copa do Nordeste: 2014 ==References== == External links == *Joelinton career stats \u2013 Topforward *footballzz.co.uk Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pernambuco Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Sport Club do Recife players Category:TSG 1899 Hoffenheim players Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:Premier League players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Austria Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Expatriate footballers in England ",
