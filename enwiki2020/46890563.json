SQream DB is designed for big data analytics using the Structured Query Language (SQL). ==History== SQream DB is the first product from SQream Technologies Ltd, founded in 2010 by Ami Gal and Kostya Varakin in Tel Aviv, Israel. SQream DB was first released in 2014 after a partnership with an Orange S.A. in Silicon Valley. The company claimed Orange S.A. saved $6 million by using SQream in 2014. SQream DB is aimed at the budget multi-terabyte analytics market, due to its modest hardware requirements and use of compression. SQream DB is also the basis for a product named GenomeStack, for querying many DNA sequences simultaneously. (in Hebrew) A US$7.4M investment of venture capital was announced in June 2015. (Registration required) It is an example of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units, alongside Omnisci and Kinetica.
