    "text": "Istaby Runestone, side A Istaby Runestone, side B The Istaby Runestone, listed in the Rundata catalog as DR 359, is a runestone with an inscription in Proto- Norse which was raised in Istaby, Blekinge, Sweden, during the Vendel era (c. 550-790). ==Inscription== ===Transliteration into Latin characters=== :AP Afatz hAriwulafa \u00b6 hA\u00feuwulafz hAeruwulafiz :AQ hA\u00feuwulafz hAeruwulafiz \u00b6 Afatz hAriwulafa :B warAit runAz \u00feAiAzProjektet Samnordisk runtextdatabas - Rundata entry for DR 359. ===Transcription into Proto-Norse=== :AP Aftr Hariwulfa. Ha\u00feuwulfz Heruwulfiz :AQ Ha\u00feuwulfz Heruwulfiz aftr Hariwulfa :B wrait runaz \u00feaiaz. ===English translation=== :AP In memory of Hariwulfar. Ha\u00feuwulfar, Heruwulfar's son, :AQ Ha\u00feuwulf(a)r, Heruwulfar's son, in memory of Hariwulfar :B wrote these runes. ==Interpretation== The Istaby, Stentoften Runestone and Gummarp Runestone inscriptions can be identified with the same clan through the names that are mentioned on them.Looijenga (2003:188). The names have alliterative first name element combined with a lycophoric second element that represent an aristocratic naming tradition common among chieftains.Sundqvist & Hultg\u00e5rd (2004:584-85). The Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone lacks names and is raised some tens of kilometers from the others. However, it is beyond doubt that the Bj\u00f6rketorp runestone is connected to them, because in addition to the special runic forms, the same message is given on the Stentoften Runestone. Of these, on stylistics grounds, the Istaby runestone may be the oldest. The name Hariwulfa is a combination of hari meaning \"warrior\" and wulafa \"wolf,\" while the ha\u00feu of Ha\u00feuwulfz means \"battle\" and the heru of Heruwulfar, when combined in personal names, means \"sword.\"Looijenga (2003:181). The latter name also has a suffix indicating paternal descent, so the name Heruwulfar in full means \"of the family of Sword-Wolf.\" A shortened form of the name Hariwulfa survived into the Viking Age and is attested in the inscription on the H\u00e6rulf Runestone. It has been suggested that the assignment of such lycophoric names is related to ritualistic practices and religious wolf-symbolism used in the initiation of young warriors.Gr\u00e4slund (2006:125). The Istaby runestone is currently located at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. The stone has a Danish Rundata catalog number as Blekinge was part of the historic Denmark. ==References== ==Sources== * *Jacobsen, Lis & Moltke, Erik: Danmarks Runeindskrifter. 3rd tome. 1941. * * ==External links== *Photograph of stone in 1999 - Swedish National Heritage Board Category:6th-century inscriptions Category:7th-century inscriptions Category:8th-century inscriptions Category:Ha\u00feuwulf's runestones Category:Proto-Norse language Category:Runestones in Blekinge Category:Elder Futhark inscriptions ",
