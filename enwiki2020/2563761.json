Currently the Monastery of the Holy Spirit is a community of forty-eight monks spanning several generations, who live, work and pray at the Abbey. They were founded from the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky in the spring of 1944. The monastery is sustained through the Abbey Store, a bonsai garden plant and supply business, a stained glass manufacturing business, donations, a green cemetery, and onsite retreats - among other endeavors. The monastery and grounds are a part of the Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area and also serves as the southernmost point on the Arabia Mountain PATH.http://arabiaalliance.org ==History== right Monastery of the Holy Spirit was founded on March 21, 1944 by twenty monks from the Abbey of Gethsemani. On of land donated by the Archdiocese of Atlanta and media mogul Henry Luce, these first monks lived in a barn while they built (by themselves) what would become known as the \"pine board\" monastery. They then lived in this monastery from December 1944 -1959 while they built (by themselves) the present Monastery, a beautiful concrete structure complete with a retreat house and cloister. In 2005, the pine board monastery which housed their carpentry and stained glass businesses was destroyed in a fire.http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1547 New Georgia Encyclopedia Some previous abbots have been Dom Augustine Moore, Dom Armand Veilleux, Dom Bernard Johnson, and Dom Basil Pennington. The present abbot is Dom Francis Michael Stiteler, who was elected in 2004. ==Prayer, confession and spiritual direction== The main work of the monks at the monastery is prayer. The monks begin their day of prayer at 4 A.M. with vigils and a half hour of contemplation. They break at about 5:30 and return at 7 A.M. for Mass. Throughout their day of work in their many businesses and chores, the monks break for prayer at midmorning, midday(12:15), evening (vespers at 5:20) and compline (night prayer at 7:30). Grand silence for both monks and guests is required after 8 P.M. Retreat house guests are allowed and encouraged to pray with the monks in the Church. At least half of the monks at Holy Spirit Monastery are priests who rotate in administering the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) at the retreat house. Monks are also available for spiritual direction and welcome people of all faiths, including those of no faith. ==Retreats== Retreats are offered year round on a range of spiritual topics offered by the monks of Holy Spirit. Guests enjoy a meal in the refectory of the Retreat House silent dining room. The monks at Holy Spirit operate a thriving retreat business. On the premises and adjoining the church is their dormitory style retreat house where separate floors for men and women accommodate individual and groups of guests for retreats scheduled almost year round. Guests are encouraged to stay on premises for the entire time of the retreat and observe the times for prayer and meals. Meals are served in the retreat house three times a day. Guests may pray with the monks in the Church at their regular prayer times which are announced by a quiet bell. Monastery rules require guests to adhere to silence in certain areas. Retreatants may attend group discussions led by one of the monks in the conference room. Different monks lead different discussions throughout the year according to their different areas of expertise. Retreatants are encouraged to leave a donation of at least $60\u2013$100 per each night of their stay to help defray the cost of providing room and meals to retreatants.

This movement has grown in popularity over the years and now there are Lay Cistercians all over the world who are affiliated with monasteries near their groups. ==Monastic Guest Program== The monastery operates a monastic guest program for men who are interested in living the monastic life for a short period of time. The program is open to men of all faiths and regardless of marital status, but they must be in good health.
