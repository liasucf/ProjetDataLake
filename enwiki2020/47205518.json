Quote in translation: \"... the old logo of the company, showing between the big letters D and L the Six-Arm Star in a circle with the dot in the middle \u2013 because of the similarity to the Star of David \u2013 is sometimes wrongfully associated today with the Jewish memorabilia instead of the Opoczno factory.\" \u2014 Dr of Eng.

He does not elaborate on it. Budzi\u0144ski does not say, not even suggests in his article, the original meaning of the logo. The tiles are stamped with what appears to be the Star of David, but that is also a charge in coat armory. ==History== The company was formed by brothers J\u00f3zef and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Lange with businessman Jan Dziewulski.Official website, Opoczno, since 1883. 125 Years of Tradition.

The tiles stamped with the D\u2721L logo were unearthed in 2010 on the grounds of the former Treblinka extermination camp. An archaeological team performing excavations, led by Caroline Sturdy Colls of Staffordshire, explained that the evidence is of paramount importance, because the gas chambers at Treblinka were the only brick structure in the camp. The old Opoczno tiles provided the first physical proof for their existence. Survivor Jankiel Wiernik wrote in his Holocaust memoir before the end of war that the floors which he helped build, were made of such tiles. The discovery of ceramic bathroom tiles became the subject of the 2014 documentary Treblinka: Hitler's Killing Machine by the Smithsonian Channel. One of the tiles found during the archaeological dig, providing the first physical evidence for the existence of the gas chambers at Treblinka The tiles from Opoczno found at Treblinka were erroneously perceived as featuring a Star of David. Further analysis by Polish scientists led to the discovery of the true origins of the star identified as the historic trademark of the company which made the Treblinka tiles. The theory of the Star of David was therefore put to rest.Katarzyna Markusz, Odkrycie w Treblince (The discovery at Treblinka).

The Centre of Archaeology, Staffordshire University's Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Sciences. University website concerning the archeological dig at Treblinka correctly identifies Dziewulski i Lange as the manufacturer of the tiles found by the Coll's team.Wiadomosci.Dziennik.pl, Sensacyjne odkrycia archeolog\u00f3w w Treblince, galeria (Sensational discoveries by archeologists). Quote in translation from Dziennik.pl: The most interesting find of the archeologists were the tiles used in the building of the old gas chambers. Two tiles were found. It has been known since several days that the tiles came from the ceramics factory Dziewulski i Lange of Opoczno. Edward Kop\u00f3wka, who is probably the world's leading expert on Treblinka, said the following: 'Although the tiles display a Star of David they were produced by a Polish factory, later taken over by a German Volksdeutsche.\" Polish original: \"Najciekawsze odkrycie archeolog\u00f3w to kafelki, kt\u00f3rymi wyko\u0144czone by\u0142y tzw. stare komory gazowe. Znaleziono dwie p\u0142ytki. Od kilku dni wiadomo, \u017ce pochodz\u0105 one z fabryki ceramicznej Dziewulski i Lange z Opoczna. 'Mimo, \u017ce na p\u0142ytkach widnieje gwiazda Dawida wyprodukowa\u0142a je firma polska przej\u0119ta p\u00f3\u017aniej przez niemieckiego volksdeutscha' \u2013 poinformowa\u0142 Edward Kop\u00f3wka.\" Retrieved July 9, 2015. Even though all Treblinka tiles display a logo, it is not known what the meaning of the star might have been. Lange is not a Slavic surname. Once established, the logo remained in use during the interwar period. The foundry survived the 1939 invasion of Poland and remained in private hands until 1949. During the darkest years of Stalinism in Poland it was appropriated by the state and renamed. Only after the Treblinka discovery, the star became the subject of intense scrutiny; described as the mullet of six points, pierced 12px similar to a Star of David. Archeological assessments published by Staffordshire in the period following the Smithsonian documentary no longer identified the logo as Jewish in origin, an issue of central importance previously. Treblinka extermination camp built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II operated between , and , as part of Operation Reinhard, the most deadly phase of the Final Solution. During this time, between 700,000 and 900,000 Polish Jews were killed in its gas chambers disguised as shower-rooms complete with ceramic bathroom tiles. More victims were gassed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz. ==See also== *Economy of Poland ==References== Category:Ceramics manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies of Poland Category:Opoczno County Category:Polish brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1886 Category:1886 establishments in Poland Category:Treblinka extermination camp ",
