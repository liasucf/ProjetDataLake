Its board of directors: Alexander Lang Elder of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank and six others with banking interests in India, Canada and Africa, promoted the sale of its shares always referring to the Otago goldfields and the spectacular growth in the amount of gold exported from Otago.Money-Market & City Intelligence.

Larnach had joined the Bank of New South Wales about 1863 and risen to manager of their Geelong branch at a time when poor communications placed heavy responsibility on branch managers.

William Larnach was also a family friend of W. J. T. Clarke, said at that time to be the richest man in Australasia. After the Bank of Otago became the National Bank Larnach was expected to remain with them a further twelve months.Scholefield, G. H., \"Larnach, William James Mudie\", A Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Wellington: 1940. p. 485.
