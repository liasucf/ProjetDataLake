    "text": "\"Armata Strigoi\" is a song by the German power metal group Powerwolf released on 5 June 2015. It was the first single released from the album Blessed & Possessed. The music video was released on YouTube on 2 June 2015. == Subject == The title of the song references a demon from Romanian mythology known as strigoi. Its text tells a story of Voivode of Wallachia Vlad the Impaler. During the night of 16\u201317 June, Vlad broke into the Ottoman camp in an attempt to capture or kill the sultan. Either the imprisonment or the death of the sultan would have caused a panic among the Ottomans, which could have enabled Vlad to defeat the Ottoman army. However, the Wallachians \"missed the court of the sultan himself\" and attacked the tents of the viziers Mahmut Pasha and Isaac. Having failed to attack the sultan's camp, Vlad and his retainers left the Ottoman camp at dawn. Mehmed entered T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te at the end of June. The town had been deserted, but the Ottomans were horrified to discover a \"forest of the impaled\" (thousands of stakes with the carcasses of executed people), according to Chalkokondyles. == Credits and personnel == * Attila Dorn \u2013 vocals * Matthew Greywolf \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar * Charles Greywolf \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar, bass guitar * Roel van Helden \u2013 drums, percussion * Falk Maria Schlegel \u2013 organ, keyboards * Jens Bogren \u2013 mastering * Sam Braun \u2013 engineer * David Buballa \u2013 engineer * Charles Greywolf \u2013 engineer * Matthew Greywolf \u2013 artwork, layout * Kristian \"Kohle\" Kohlmannslehner \u2013 engineer * Manuela Meyer \u2013 photography * Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m \u2013 mixing * Henrik Udd \u2013 mixing == References == == External links == * Category:Powerwolf songs Category:2015 singles Category:2015 songs Category:Napalm Records singles ",
