    "text": "The Eighth Battle of the Isonzo was fought from October 10\u201312, 1916 between Italy and Austria-Hungary. == Battle == The Eighth Battle of the Isonzo, fought briefly from 10\u201312 October 1916, was essentially a continuation of attempts made during the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo (14\u201317 September 1916) to extend the bridgehead established at Gorizia during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in August 1916. Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna was determined to continue Italian attacks to the left of the town, a policy that continued during the following (ninth) battle - with an equal lack of success. As with the earlier, Seventh, attack, heavy Italian casualties required that the short, sharp concentrated initiative be called off pending the army's recuperation. The seemingly interminable Isonzo onslaught was next renewed with the Ninth Battle of the Isonzo on 1 November 1916, the fifth and final attack of the year. Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia, a key member of the Futurist movement in architecture, was killed during the battle. ==See also== *First Battle of the Isonzo - 23 June 1915 - 7 July 1915 *Second Battle of the Isonzo - 18 July 1915 - 3 August 1915 *Third Battle of the Isonzo - 18 October 1915 - 3 November 1915 *Fourth Battle of the Isonzo - 10 November 1915 - 2 December 1915 *Fifth Battle of the Isonzo - 9-17 March 1916 *Sixth Battle of the Isonzo - 6-17 August 1916 *Seventh Battle of the Isonzo - 14-17 September 1916 *Ninth Battle of the Isonzo - 1-4 November 1916 *Tenth Battle of the Isonzo - 12 May 1917 - 8 June 1917 *Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo - 19 August 1917 - 12 September 1917 *Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo - 24 October 1917 - 7 November 1917 also known as the Battle of Caporetto ==References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== *FirstWorldWar.Com: The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17 *Battlefield Maps: Italian Front *11 battles at the Isonzo *The Walks of Peace in the So\u010da Region Foundation.
