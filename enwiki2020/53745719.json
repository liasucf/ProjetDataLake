At the , Huntly had a population of 2,379. ==History== Huntly is a rural township on the Midland Highway, 12 km north-east of Bendigo, but only a few kilometres beyond Bendigo\u2019s urban fringe. The name is thought to have been inspired by Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The name was first given to the local parish in a map drawn in 1854. Bendigo was the site of one of Victoria\u2019s largest gold rushes in 1851, but prospecting did not extend to Huntly until some years later. It was used for pastoral and horticultural activities for food for the gold fields. ==The Town today== Huntly has a war memorial for the soldiers who fought for Australia. It also has a primary school, but because of its closeness to Bendigo and rural areas the population can access Bendigo's resources as their own. Huntly also has an Australian rules football team that plays in the HDFL called the Huntly Hawks. Since its beginning it has become runner-up in 2013. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) ",
