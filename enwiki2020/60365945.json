It originates in a hilly area (100 to 200 m above sea level) and travels east while being joined by the rivers Yoshino (or Takaza) (\u9ad8\u5ea7\u5ddd), Ebi (\u6d77\u8001\u5ddd), Sancho (\u4e09\u6240\u5ddd), Isobe (\u9d28\u90e8\u5ddd), and Hino (\u8fb0\u30ce\u5c3e\u5ddd). Most of its course is now channeled and runs through fully urbanized areas. It finally merges with the Kagami River, about 1 km southwest of the K\u014dchi Castle, which, after another 4 km, flows into Urato (Urado) Bay, a small branch of Tosa Bay. The backswamp, which accounts for the majority of the river's drainage basin, was mostly wetland until the end of World War II, but it has since become a residential area. ==References== Category:Rivers of K\u014dchi Prefecture Category:Rivers of Japan ",
