    "text": "Sozita Goudouna (Greek: \u03a3\u03c9\u03b6\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1 \u0393\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1) is a curator, professor and the author of Beckett's Breath: Anti-theatricality and the Visual Arts on Samuel Beckett's Breath, one of the shortest plays ever written for the theatre, published by Edinburgh University Press and released in the US by Oxford University Press. According to William Hutchings' review at the Comparative Drama Conference Series 15, Goudouna's book is surely the most ever said about the least in the entire history of literary criticism. Goudouna was selected as the inaugural Andrew W. Mellon Foundation curator at Performa (performance festival) in New York City founded by Roselee Goldberg. Goudouna served as the director of the first European funded Art Residency and as the Visual Art Consultant of the Onassis Foundation Festival in New York. She curated a project with Paul B. Preciado with the participation of Karen Finley at the Parliament of Bodies public arts program at Documenta 14 and in 2019 she joined as head of operations Raymond Pettibon Studio == Education == Goudouna moved to London in 1996 where she settled until 2012. She received her BA (Hons) in Philosophy with Theatre from London Metropolitan University and holds a Master of Arts (MA) in Text, Performance and Directing from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and in English Literature from Kings College, University of London. She holds a PhD from the University of London on high modernist theory focusing on Michael Fried and the work of Samuel Beckett supervised by David Bradby. Goudouna received a scholarship in 2002 from the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation Public Benefit Foundation to pursue her PhD research. == Early life == Goudouna was born in Athens, Greece. When she was 15 she co-organised, with a collective of five friends, the first renowned concert in Greece in support of ACT UP at the old brewery of FIX with the participation of school bands and of popular alternative bands including Deus Ex Machina, Groove Machine, Make Believe and Honey Dive. Goudouna first gained art world attention in 2000, when she directed for RADA a performance and visual art project in a listed house at Duke st in London, in collaboration with dancers from The Place based on Ritter, Dene, Voss by Thomas Bernhardt. The site specific project at Duke st alluded to Haus Wittgenstein's modernist house in Vienna. == Beckett's Breath == Goudouna's book Beckett's Breath: Antitheatricality and the Visual Arts was published by Edinburgh University Press in 2018 and released in the US by Oxford University Press. Samuel Beckett wrote Breath (play), a thirty-second playlet for the stage that does not include actors, text, characters or drama but only stage directions. Goudouna's monograph analyses the ways the piece became emblematic of the intermedia exchanges that occur in Beckett's later writings, as well as the cross-fertilisation of the theatre with the visual arts. The book examines Beckett's ultimate venture to define the borders between a theatrical performance and purely visual representation and juxtaposes Beckett's Breath with breath-related artworks by visual artists including Valie Export, Feminist Art Workers, Marcel Duchamp, Piero Manzoni, Gerhard Richter, Bridget Riley, Giuseppe Penone, John Latham, Vito Acconci, Chris Burden, Nancy Spero, Lygia Clark, Art & Language, Marina Abramovi\u0107. == Performa Biennial (New Visual Performance Festival) == Goudouna was selected in May 2015 as the first Andrew W. Mellon Foundation curatorial fellow at Performa. In 2005 Performa (performance festival) hosted the first Performa Biennial, a series of performance events at venues and institutions across New York City by its founding curator and editor Roselee Goldberg. For the 2005 Biennial the Solomon R. Guggenheim presented Marina Abramovi\u0107's Seven Easy Pieces, in which Abramovi\u0107 re-performed several works from the canon of early performance works, including two of her own. Performances included works by Gina Pane, Vito Acconci, Valie Export, Bruce Nauman, and Joseph Beuys. For Performa15, that celebrated ten years since the founding of the Performa biennial in 2005, Goudouna worked for the production of new commissions by artists Yvonne Rainer, Tania Bruguera, Francesco Vezzoli, David Hallberg, Juliana Huxtable, Robin Rhode, Laura Lima, Heather Phillipson, Chimurenga, Edgar Arceneaux, Erika Vogt and Performa alums J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel, Jesper Just among others. During Goudouna's post in 2015, Performa announced a new partnership with the Paris- based arts organisation Lafayette Anticipation, Fondation Galeries Lafayette. For Performa, Goudouna initiated the commissions from Performa Archives among other initiatives. == Raymond Roussel Society == Goudouna curated a production on Raymond Roussel's Locus Solus that was presented from 2009 until 2010 as a location driven project in Shunt Vaults Shunt (theatre company) London Bridge, The Byzantine and Christian Museum and the Benaki Museum, as well as in public spaces in Elephant and Castle. For this project Goudouna collaborated with Werner Nekes, Mat Collishaw, Flux Factory NYC, The International Institute for Important Items and more than 100 artists and architects. Owing to Goudouna's extensive research on Roussel she was invited to participate in the tribute to John Ashbery.Raymond Roussel Society consists of a special team of creators, thinkers and artists who were profoundly affected by Roussel. The Raymond Roussel Society honoured John Ashbery with the Raymond Roussel Society Medal in June 2017 in New York. == Ecological activities == Sozita Goudouna has been widely involved in ecological Activism. She ran for the municipal elections of the island of Hydra in 2010 as a member of the Ecological Association The Hydra Seal. Since 1988 she is a member of the association which was founded in 1988 in Hydra (island) with the aim to protect the environment and Greek cultural heritage within the broad areas of archaeology, traditional settlements and submarine antiquities in Hydra (island) and Dokos . The range of the Association's activities covers the protection of natural reserves, protected species and most notably the Mediterranean monk seal \"Monachus- Monachus\" Mediterranean monk seal which lives and reproduces in the Myrtoan Sea and the eastern part of the Peloponnese. The ecological association has received support from Stavros Niarchos Foundation. In 2002 she became a board member of the association. As a board member she co-organised projects in collaboration with the Zoology Department at the University of Athens, the University of the Aegean, the Ministry of Environment, Energy & Climate Change, the European Union and other organisations including WWF World Wide Fund for Nature and mother Society for the Study and Protection of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. The projects that she is actively involved include the following: The Association's protection of the traditional settlements and the archaeological heritage have led to six executive decrees for the benefit of Hydra, including the 1993 the transference of jurisdictions from the Ministry of Environment, Energy & Climate Change and the Ministry of the Aegean Sea to the Ministry of Culture. In 1994 the ancient island of \"Aperopia\" Dokos known today as \"Dokos\" was proclaimed as \"Non-building Zone A\" and the sea around Dokos an archaeological park. In 1996, Hydra was declared an archaeological space and every settlement of the island was held under the auspices of the state. In 1998,the department of Byzantine and post- Byzantine Monuments resulted in the placing of signs/epigraphs in Hydra under particular specifications. In 2002, the association resolved the issue of the ban of vehicles in Hydra with the publication of a joint Ministerial decree regarding the circulation of vehicles in the island. The Association is organising events with institutions including the \"Hellenic Society for the Protection of the Environment and the Cultural Heritage,\" the Goulandris Natural History Museum,the Benaki Museum, the National Gallery,the Byzantine Museum and National Television ERT where Goudouna presented a show on Art and Upcycling ==Bibliography== * 2018 Beckett's Breath: Antitheatricality and the Visual Arts Edinburgh University Press * Space, Kenji Aoki, Monograph, Kehrer Verlag in English and German (forthcoming). * 2018 Mat Chivers in Horea Avram (ed) Moving Images, Mobile Bodies.
