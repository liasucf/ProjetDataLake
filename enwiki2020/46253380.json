    "text": "Jacki Apple is an American artist, writer, composer, producer and educator based in New York City. She has worked in multiple disciplines such as performance art and installation art. As well as art making, Apple is also a writer, penning around 200 reviews and critical essays on topics such as performance art, media arts, installation art and dance. Her writing has appeared in publications such as Performing Arts Journal, Public Art Review and The Drama Review. == Early career == As a fashion designer she worked mainly with the effects of disguise on other people, or in relation to herself. \u201cTransfers/Exchanges\u201d (exploring [Freud\u2019s idea of] the four people in every relationship between two); \u201cIdentity Exchanges\u201d (changing roles with another person); and Identity Redefinition (many views of own\u2019s self as defined by others\u2019 perceptions.) Soliciting opinions about her appearance from others and documenting them evolved into a new form of self-portrait. == Artworks == Her work deals with memory, history, and the interface between nature and culture, the relationship between matter and consciousness, and historical, biological, and geological time, as well as political and social issues. Loss, disappearances, and dislocations are often underlying themes. The interdisciplinary performance The Amazon, The Mekong, The Missouri and the Nile (1985), a discourse on the nature of colonialism was conceived by artist/writer Jacki Apple, choreographer Mary Jane Eisenberg, and composer/musician Bruce Fowler.Gardner, Colin. \u201cColonialism and Postmodernism\u201d, Artweek, Sept 7,1985 Since 1990 she has been exploring subjects such as species extinction ((The Culture of Disappearance ) and natural disasters (You Don't Need A Weatherman). Archaeology, paleontology, theoretical and astrophysics, earth sciences, and the politics of culture, music and dance have been influential sources. (1). Apple chose physicist David Bohm\u2019s Wholeness and the Implicate Order upon which to base her performance spectacle Fluctuations of the Field., \u201cand it is nothing less than a demonstration, in the language of avant-garde performance, of the nature of reality in both its physical and social manifestations.\u201d Spiegel, Judith. \u201cThe Physics of Performance\u201d, Artweek,Sept 7, 1985 == Audio and radio == Apple has worked on inserting the artist's voice into mass media as well as creating works for installations and performances. Her text/sound/music audio and radio works consist of layered intersecting textual and sonic narratives, and have been broadcast worldwide. She has approached aural space as a multi- dimensional place equivalent to three-dimensional visual space, and radio as a performance space. She creates hybrid forms\u2014talking pictures, orchestrated texts and sonic architecture, to create a perceptual shift and transport the listener to someplace unexpected. The recording studio has been her compositional instrument, and she views producing as a compositional art form.^Jump up to: a b \"Jacki Apple\". SpacesGallery.org. Spaces Gallery Retrieved 28 March 2015. Edited April 2018 Works commissioned by New America Radio include the collaborative six-part radio series Redefining Democracy in America 1991-92. In Parts 1, 2, & 3: Episodes in Black and White(1991) Apple and collaborating writer/performers Linda Albertano, Keith Antar Mason, and Akilah Nayo Oliver explored issues of race, sex, money, power, drugs, family, children, violence, language and censorship, and raised questions about who speaks, who is listened to, who is heard, who is silenced. Parts 4 & 5: The Voices of America 1992 produced with KPFK-FM, Los Angeles, posed the questions \"What would you say to your fellow citizens if you were running for president? What should we aspire to and how should we get there?\" providing a forum for Americans across the political and cultural spectrum to speak to fellow listeners. In Part 6: A Leap of Faith (1992) with writer, performer Keith Antar Mason, a white American woman and an African-American man born in America in the middle of the twentieth century on opposite sides of the dividing line, take an imaginary journey through time. \u201cJacki Apple\u201d http://www.somewhere.org New Radio and Performing Arts * 1989 Swan Lake * 1991 The Culture of Disappearance * 1991 Voices in the Dark * 1997 You Don't Need A Weatherman\u201cJacki Apple\u201dhttp://www.somewhere.org New Radio and Performing Arts Co-produced by sound artist Jacki Apple and Julie Adler, the annual EARJAM new music festival was an eclectic sonic cavalcade featuring around thirty local musicians in the adventurous jazz, contemporary and experimental realms from 2000-2004 at Side Street Live, the Armory Northwest, and REDCAT in Los Angeles.
