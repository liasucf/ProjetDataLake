    "text": "The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada (ARCC) is a Canadian pro-choice organization which was founded in 2005. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, it is currently the only political group in Canada which is engaged in pro-abortion activism on a national level. ==Background== Canada is signed under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, but fails to meet standards outlined within it regarding abortion. The availability of abortion services is decreasing in Canada, and the government has yet to approve of a safe pharmaceutical medication for abortion, known as mifepristone. Some women in Canada still have problems accessing abortion services because about 80% of hospitals won't perform them. Other challenges to abortion in Canada include protests outside abortion clinics. Legislation was imposed to put an end to these protests, and it was mostly effective, but some still continue to protest outside the clinics. ==External links== *Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada web site ==References== Category:Abortion-rights organizations in Canada Category:Organizations established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in British Columbia Category:Organizations based in Vancouver ",
