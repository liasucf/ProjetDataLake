Among the newly formed was the Combined Officer Regiment, which later received the nominal patronage of its first commander, General Markov. During the campaign, the future artillery of the Markovites was also reorganized: the 1st Separate Light Artillery Division was disbanded, and the 1st Officer Battery, which was part of it, after the 4th Battery of the division was included in it, was called the 1st Separate Battery as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade. In mid-March 1918, on the basis of the Technical Company formed in December 1917, the 1st Engineering Company, which entered the 1st Brigade, was organized. She received the patronage of General Markov on December 21, 1919.
