    "text": "Harold Schultz Slusher (1934\u2014) is an American physicist and young-earth creationist. He is assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at El Paso and a member of the Institute for Creation Research. In 1986, Kendrick Frazier called him \"perhaps the most outspoken critic of conventional science among the creationists\". ==Education== Slusher says he has an honorary D.Sc. from Indiana Christian University (ICU) and a Ph.D. in geophysics from Columbia Pacific University. However, according to Robert Schadewald, ICU is a Bible college with no more than two people in its graduate science department, and that CPU \"exhibits several qualities of a degree mill\". ==References== Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Living people Category:American Christian Young Earth creationists Category:University of Texas at El Paso faculty Category:Indiana Christian University alumni Category:Columbia Pacific University alumni Category:1934 births ",
