The house and grounds are owned and managed by Cambridge City Council. The Hall is most well known for hosting the annual Cambridge Folk Festival, an ever-growing (in size and popularity) event that regularly draws thousands to the park. During the summer months, aside from hosting the Folk Festival, Cherry Hinton Hall is alive with predominantly young families enjoying the wide open grass spaces and the large duck pond which for many is the defining feature of the park along with the vast array of other wildlife living there. Many community activities also take place in the park, such as an archaeological and buildings survey carried out by children at the local St Bede's Inter-Church School, in 2007. In 2007, Cherry Hinton Hall became home to Cambridge International School and later Holme Court School, a specialist school for children with dyslexia and related conditions. It is now home to Oaks International School, which is owned by the International Schools Partnership. The Friends of Cherry Hinton Hall was formed in 2009 as a group concerned about the usage, environment, welfare and future of the park for the benefit of those who use it most. ==John and Mary Okes== Advertisement for Cherry Hinton Hall in 1870.
