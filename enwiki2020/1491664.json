Regarding Homer-Dixon's claim that \"equates resource extraction with low innovation\", Gerson argued that Canada's current oilsands industry \"required most a century of research, development and high-risk capital investment\", while claiming that \"For a professor of any repute to associate oilsands with low innovation is patently ignorant.\" In addition, Gerson stated that the oilsands industry \"is pumping billions of dollars into an otherwise struggling economy\", while quipping (about Homer-Dixon) that \"It must be nice to be a professor who can call for the shuttering of an industry that millions of Canadians rely upon to pay their mortgages.\"Jen Gerson\u2019s Western Front: Ontario prof mistakes personal views on oilsands for reasoned argument by Jen Gerson, National Post, April 3, 2013. ==Bibliography== * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== *The Upside of Down site *Official site *Bookshorts video *Online interview from CBC Words at Large *Audio interview with THECOMMENTARY.CA, November 2006 *Imagine BC biography and photos *Video (and audio) interview/discussion with Homer-Dixon by John Horgan on Bloggingheads.tv *Keynote Speech at the 2008 National Foreign Policy Conference by Homer-Dixon about \"Energy and Climate Change: A Sustainable Future?\", June 20, 2008.
