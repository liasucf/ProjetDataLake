The purpose of the company is to hatch hybrid hens, which lay more than 250 eggs a year, which are imitating the non-hybrid species of hens, which do not die permaturely, which are not aggressive, which are well feathered and which are all the same size. The hybrids are always hatched from two non- hybridized hens. The hens start to lay eggs in the 20th\u201323rd week of their life.

Hens hatched by this company are favorite, because of their easy breeding and higher egg-laying and lifetime unlike other hens.
