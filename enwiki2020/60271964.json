Lithuania to hold referendum on reducing number of MPs Baltic News Network, 17 February 2019 In order for the first constitutional amendment to be passed, voter turnout was required to be above 50%, and at least 33.3% of registered voters would have to vote in favour of the proposal. For the second amendment, at least 50% of registered voters would have to vote in favour of the proposal.

The proposal on dual citizenship had a turnout of over 50% and was approved by 73% of those voting, but this amounted to only 38% of eligible voters.Baigti skai\u010diuoti referendum\u0173 rezultatai: referendumas d\u0117l pilietyb\u0117s i\u0161saugojimo \u012fvyko, bet bals\u0173 \u201eu\u017e\u201c neu\u017eteko Delfi, 13 May 2019 ==Background== The proposal to allow dual citizenship was approved by a vote in the Seimas in October, and would involve amending article 12 of the constitution.Mandatory referendum on dual citizenship due to be held Seimas In a draft constitutional law that sat alongside the proposal, this would be limited to member countries of the European Union, European Economic Area, NATO and the OECD and explicitly prohibit dual citizenship with countries involved in organisations based around the former Soviet Union, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Collective Security Treaty Organization and Eurasian Economic Union.Pilietyb\u0117s konstitucinio \u012fstatymo projektas E-seimas The proposal to reduce the number of MPs was suggested by the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
