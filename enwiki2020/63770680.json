    "text": "Sara H. Cody, M.D., is an American doctor, epidemiologist and public health official serving as the health officer and public health director of Santa Clara County, California, at the time of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Her timely implementation of stay-at-home orders in coordination with other San Francisco Bay Area health officials is credited with preventing an estimated 188,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 deaths in major Bay Area cities. Cody continues to maintain a regular presence in the media to communicate COVID-19 news and policy. ==Education== Cody graduated from Stanford University, receiving a degree in human biology, and subsequently completing her Doctor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Following an internship and residency in internal medicine at Stanford University Medical Center, Cody completed a two- year fellowship in epidemiology and public health, as an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ==Career== During her fellowship as epidemic intelligence service officer, she investigated an international E. coli outbreak that was linked to unpasteurized apple juice. She also led an investigation into a salmonella outbreak in Santa Clara County which was traced to raw milk. After completion of this fellowship, Cody joined the Public Health Department of Santa Clara County. In 1998, she became the deputy health officer for the county. In this role she oversaw surveillance and investigation of 83 reportable diseases, conducted investigations on outbreaks, and responded to SARS, H1N1 and other public health emergencies. In the years after the September 11 attacks, Cody worked with the then county health officer Marty Fenstersheib to model Santa Clara County's emergency response to a bioterrorism attack or pandemic. This model included such measures as social distancing, shutting schools and at its most extreme, mandating that people stay home. In 2013, Cody moved into the role of county health officer. In 2015, she was also appointed to the position of director of public health for the county and has since maintained the dual role. ===COVID-19 outbreak=== Along with other public health officers in the region, Cody was largely credited for promptly advocating for measures that would limit the spread of COVID-19 when the pandemic reached the United States in 2020. She led the Santa Clara County Public Health Department to establish an incident command center on January 23, three days after the first confirmed case in the country, then established a contact tracing mechanism in an effort to stop the propagation of the disease. Cody issued the first guidelines on the closure and cancelation of public gatherings on March 3, extending them to sporting events, festivals and bars on March 9. She was an early advocate of requiring residents to \"shelter-in-place\", which was put in effect on March 16 in seven counties of the Bay area., with California Governor Gavin Newsom adopting that policy for the whole state three days later. Cody explained that \"If you are going to do something really drastic like shelter-in-place, you want to do it as early as you possibly can. Because if you wait to do it, you get all the harms, all of the social and economic disruptions, but you miss a lot of the benefit.\" Cody has made regular appearances on Bay Area press and video conferences, explaining county health policy and reminding residents that the COVID-19 battle is a long-term health concern: \"Because we flattened the curve, it doesn\u2019t mean that we are done. Because we are far, far, far from done.\" In a press conference in April, Cody confirmed that the first United States COVID-19 death had actually occurred in the Bay Area on February 6, some 23 days prior to the previously known first death. This was the first of three early COVID-19 deaths, which Cody described as \"iceberg tips\", suggesting that there was a vast and unseen propagation. Following one news conference, she became the subject of a viral meme, after she implored citizens to refrain from touching their faces, then licked her finger to turn a page. Cody received threats from residents unhappy with the drastic nature the measures put in place. In late August, the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced they arrested a man suspected of sending her several threatening letters, which used language typical of far-right movements. Police found 138 firearms at his residence. Charged with stalking and threatening a public official, he remained in jail while waiting for court proceedings. The police maintains 24-hour protection around Cody. ==Personal life== Cody is a resident of Palo Alto. ==References== Category:American physicians Category:Living people Category:People from Palo Alto, California Category:American epidemiologists Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Yale School of Medicine alumni Category:COVID-19 pandemic in California Category:Government of Santa Clara County, California Category:Women epidemiologists Category:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
