Later, her work has helped influence government policy making on health care. Her article on the Romanow Commission, co-authored by Sujit Choudhry, criticized the Canada Health Act and was cited in the 2002 Canadian Health Care system report by Michael J. L. Kirby. In 2004, Flood was appointed a Senior Fellow of Massey College. In 2005, Flood and fellow University of Toronto faculty members Kent Roach and Lorne Sossin co-edited a book titled \"The Legal Debate over Private Health Insurance in Canada.\" That same year, she was named an editor of a newly formed quarterly journal, Healthcare Policy. While working as an Associate Professor and Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Toronto in 2006, Flood was appointed the new Scientific Director of Health Services and Policy Research within Canadian Institutes of Health Research. That same year, she edited a book titled \"Just Medicare: What's In, What's Out, How We Decide\" which discussed Canadian health law and policy based on conferences held at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. In 2007, Flood was awarded the Jerry Lee Lectureship as part of the 7th Annual International Campbell Collaboration Colloquium. She was the first woman and Canadian to earn this Lectureship. While with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Flood increased funding for health policy and research by creating a program called \u201cEvidence on Tap.\u201d The program, which was piloted in Saskatchewan, Ontario, and New Brunswick, involved health researchers meeting with government personnel to discuss where they needed research evidence. This led to the creation of the Evidence Informed Healthcare Renewal program. In 2011, Dr. Robyn Tamblyn replaced Flood as Scientific Director. She then took a sabbatical before returning to the University of Toronto. Since 2013, the CIHR Institute of Health Services and Policy Research has awarded a prize in the name of Flood and Morris Barer to recognize a researcher who has had a significant impact on health services and policy research, policy, and/or care delivery.

She also simultaneously served on the board of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and as chair of their Scientific Advisory Committee. In 2016, Flood was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada for her impact on health care and policies.
