This is accomplished via a transfer switch. #In telephony, a function which, when activated in the event of a commercial power failure or a low-voltage battery condition at a subscriber location, supplies power to predesignated subscriber equipment via the central office trunk. Power-failure transfer is an emergency mode of operation in which one and only one instrument may be powered from each trunk line from the subscriber location to the central office. ==References== Category:Engineering failures ",
