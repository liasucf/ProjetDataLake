It was their only release through Epic Records.Chad, \"Live Makes Epic Move\" Alternative Addiction - August 29, 2005 The first single, \"The River\", was released on March 21, 2006. Although the album had some international success, including reaching number 1 in the Netherlands, it had the lowest US sales of any of Live's studio albums since their first album, Mental Jewelry, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard 200. ==Background== Live signed with Epic Records in 2005, having left Radioactive after the release of their 2003 album, Birds of Pray. Singer Ed Kowalczyk explained that Songs from Black Mountain is in the same vein as Birds of Pray: \"The album itself kind of took its lead from where we were with Birds of Pray, which was just a really basic, stripped [approach]...It's just amazing. It's just a great album and the excitement level of [Epic] and the band, everybody is just really pretty blown away by it.\"Chad, \"Live Goes Back to Basics for Epic Debut\".
