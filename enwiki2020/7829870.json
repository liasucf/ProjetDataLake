    "text": "Westbury is a station on the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line. All trains for the Port Jefferson Branch and Ronkonkoma Branch run through it, though only some trains on the Port Jefferson branch stop (and only a few on the Ronkonoma Branch do). It is located at Union and Post Avenues in Westbury, New York. It is 23.4 miles (37.7 km) from Penn Station. The station is fully wheelchair accessible. It has two side platforms and two tracks. ==History== The original Westbury station was the J.P. Kelsey General Store. Westbury station was built sometime in March 1837 with the opening of the LIRR to Hicksville. The station was closed between June and September of the same year, briefly replaced by the nearby Carle Place station.Westbury Hempstead - Carle Place (Arrt's Arrchives) Throughout much of the mid-19th Century, the J.P. Kelsey Branch Store served as the depot.The Long Island Rail Road: The age of expansion, 1863-1880 Vincent Seyfried; Page 188 The second station was built between April and June 1883. The third station was built in 1914, and was electrified in October 1970, along with the rest of the Port Jefferson Branch between Mineola and Huntington Stations. It had a major remodeling around 1972, and another one sometime between 2001 and 2005.LIRR station History (TrainsAreFun.com) In 2000, a woman was stabbed to death in the underpass beneath the tracks. On February 26, 2019, a local eastbound train to Hicksville collided with a truck at the railroad crossing just east of the station as it was accelerating out of the station. A few seconds after that collision, a westbound Ronkonkoma Branch express train headed for Penn Station collided with the already slammed truck at the crossing and derailed past it, slamming into the Westbound platform's eastern end. The collision caused extensive damage to both the Westbound platform (easternmost two car lengths), and LIRR M7 train car #7425, killing the 3 occupants of the truck, and causing a few power poles to be replaced.http://longisland.news12.com/story/40032821/lirr-train-strikes-truck- on-tracks-in-westbury ===Post Avenue Bridge replacement=== LIRR construction workers replacing the Post Avenue bridge next to the station in October 2017. The station is located next to a bridge over Post Avenue that had an clearance that was installed during the 1914 rebuild. The bridge was hit by between five and nine high trucks per year between 2010 and 2016, causing numerous train delays in both directions. In October 2017, the LIRR replaced the old bridge with a new bridge. Despite the fact that the previous bridge was 103 years old, it was still considered to be in good condition. However, the bridge had to be replaced in preparation for the LIRR third track project; the new span had a clearance and a capacity of three tracks. === Station enhancements === Also as part of the third track project, the Westbury station will be upgraded to accommodate full-length 12-car trains. Both platforms would be replaced, and Platform B will be relocated. Canopies, benches, signage, and security cameras will be installed. The station, which is already compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, would be made more accessible via the installation of elevators and ramps, as well as a new overpass. Amenities such as Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, artwork, and digital information displays would be included in the renovation. The electrical substation at Westbury station will be replaced to make way for the third track, and a parking garage would be installed north of the station. The village of Westbury wants to redevelop the land south of the station. ==Station layout== This station has two high-level side platforms, each 12 cars long. During rush hours, trains will stop at both platforms in the peak direction, though this service pattern is expected to change with the addition of a third track. Most Ronkonkoma Branch trains, some Port Jefferson Branch, and all Montauk Branch trains pass through the station without stopping. {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=5 valign=top|P Platform level |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform A, side platform |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Track 1 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=775|\u2190 toward , , , or () \u2190 limited service toward or () PM rush hours toward or () \u2192 PM rush hours toward or () \u2192 |- |Track 2 |\u2190 AM rush hours toward , , , or () \u2190 AM rush hours toward or () toward or () \u2192 limited service toward or () \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform B, side platform |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray\"|G |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray\"|Ground level |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray\"|Exit/entrance, parking, buses |} ==References== == External links == * * *Unofficial LIRR History Website **North Side on Union Avenue **South Side with tunnel at Railroad Avenue parking lot **Platforms looking eastbound and westbound *Old Westury Station with Shelter and Freight House (TrainsAreFun.com) * Post Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Station House on Union Avenue from Google Maps Street View * Inside Station House from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:Long Island Rail Road stations in Nassau County, New York Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1837 ",
