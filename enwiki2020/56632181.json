The village is located by the European route E4 about south of L\u00f6v\u00e5nger. ==History== Until 1951, the village's name was Kr\u00e4k\u00e5nger. Kr\u00e4k is thought to be derived from a dialectal word meaning \"sharp angle\" or \"small bay\", and is related to modern Swedish krok (\"hook\") and kr\u00f6k (\"bend\"), while \u00e5nger in Swedish place names typically means \"bay\". The name may refer to the bay which historically (around 500AD) stretched from L\u00f6v\u00e5nger to Bure\u00e5, forming a sharp angle with what was at the time the L\u00f6v\u00e5nger Fjard. As cars were becoming commonplace in the 1940s, the name, and that of neighbouring village Kr\u00e4k\u00e5ngersnoret (now S\u00f6dra L\u00f6vsele), attracted ridicule from visitors due to the modern Swedish associations it suggests: kr\u00e4k[as] means \"[to] vomit\", \u00e5nger means \"regret\", and snor[et] means \"[the] snot\". As a result, the local population expressed their wishes to change the name, and the new name L\u00f6vsele was formed from sele, referring to the nearby lake Selet (the remnants of the fjard from which the earlier name had been derived), and l\u00f6v, referring to L\u00f6v\u00e5nger parish. ==References== Category:Populated places in Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality ",
