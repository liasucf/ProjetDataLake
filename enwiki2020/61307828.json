    "text": "Woodbrook railway station (Irish: St\u00e1isi\u00fan Shruth\u00e1n na Coille) is a proposed railway station to be built on the DART in the Woodbrook-Shanganagh area of Dublin, Ireland. The station is intended for an area zoned for future housing development, with access to the future station included as part of a list of strategic infrastructure projects being financed by the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund in 2017. The proposed station is unconnected to the former Woodbrook halt, the remains of which still remain along the line at Woodbrook Golf Club. Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann stated that it was going to apply for planning permission for the station in late August 2020. ==References== Category:Proposed railway stations in the Republic of Ireland ",
