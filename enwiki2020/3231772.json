The Chronicles were first published in 1675. He also wrote Istoria \u00een versuri polone despre \u0162ara Moldovei \u015fi Munteniei (Polish verse history of Moldavia and Wallachia), also known under the title Poema polon\u0103 (The Polish poem). ==Life== Miron Costin was born as the son of a rich Moldavian boyar (Ion or Iancu). He spent his earliest years in Poland, where his family had taken refuge from Ottoman violence in Moldavia. His father had become a Polish magnate, which gave Miron the right to study at the Jesuit College in Bar, then at Kamienec Podolski. He returned to Moldavia in 1653, and became a trainee of the country's treasury. Valued by the administration, he rose quickly, becoming Vornic in 1669 (i.e.: overseer of the Court, with several political responsibilities both inside the state and abroad). In 1691 his relation with Prince Constantin Cantemir deteriorated. He and his brother (Hatman Velicico) were believed to have tried to usurp the throne in Ia\u015fi: both were executed. ==Works== * Viia\u0163a lumii 1672 * The translation of Origines et occasus Transsylvanorum (Lyon, 1667) by Lauren\u021biu Toppeltin of Media\u0219 * Letopise\u0163ul \u0162\u0103r\u00e2i Moldovei de la Aron Vod\u0103 \u00eencoace 1675 German translation * Chronika ziem Moldawskich y Multanskich (Cronica \u021b\u0103rilor Moldovei \u0219i Munteniei) (in Polish) * Istoria \u00een versuri polone despre \u0162ara Moldovei \u015fi Munteniei (Poema polon\u0103) 1684 * De neamul moldovenilor approx. 1687 ==External links== * Miron Costin: Grausame Zeiten in der Moldau, Styria 1980 Graz&Vienna;&Cologne; Link ==References== Category:Romanian nobility Category:Early Modern Romanian writers Category:Moldavian and Wallachian chroniclers Category:17th-century historians Category:1633 births Category:1691 deaths Category:17th-century Romanian people ",
