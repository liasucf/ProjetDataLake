    "text": "The Beneish model is a statistical model that uses financial ratios calculated with accounting data of a specific company in order to check if it is likely (high probability) that the reported earnings of the company have been manipulated. == How to calculate == The Beneish M-score is calculated using 8 variables (financial ratios): * Days Sales in Receivables Index (DSRI) DSRI = (Net Receivablest / Salest) / (Net Receivablest-1 / Salest-1) * Gross Margin Index (GMI) GMI = [(Salest-1 \\- COGSt-1) / Salest-1] / [(Salest \\- COGSt) / Salest] * Asset Quality Index (AQI) AQI = [1 - (Current Assetst \\+ PP&E;t \\+ Securitiest) / Total Assetst] / [1 - ((Current Assetst-1 \\+ PP&E;t-1 \\+ Securitiest-1) / Total Assetst-1)] * Sales Growth Index (SGI) SGI = Salest / Salest-1 * Depreciation Index (DEPI) DEPI = (Depreciationt-1/ (PP&E;t-1 \\+ Depreciationt-1)) / (Depreciationt / (PP&E;t \\+ Depreciationt)) * Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index (SGAI) SGAI = (SG&A; Expenset / Salest) / (SG&A; Expenset-1 / Salest-1) * Leverage Index (LVGI) LVGI = [(Current Liabilitiest \\+ Total Long Term Debtt) / Total Assetst] / [(Current Liabilitiest-1 \\+ Total Long Term Debtt-1) / Total Assetst-1] * Total Accruals to Total Assets (TATA) TATA = (Income from Continuing Operationst \\- Cash Flows from Operationst) / Total Assetst The formula to calculate the M-score is: :M-score = \u22124.84 + 0.92 \u00d7 DSRI + 0.528 \u00d7 GMI + 0.404 \u00d7 AQI + 0.892 \u00d7 SGI + 0.115 \u00d7 DEPI \u22120.172 \u00d7 SGAI + 4.679 \u00d7 TATA \u2212 0.327 \u00d7 LVGI == How to interpret == The threshold value is \u22122.22: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneishmodel.asp * If M-score is less than \u22122.22, the company is unlikely to be a manipulator. * If M-score is greater than \u22122.22, the company is likely to be a manipulator. == Important notices == * Beneish M-score is a probabilistic model, so it cannot detect companies that manipulate their earnings with 100% accuracy. * Financial institutions were excluded from the sample in Beneish paper when calculating M-score. It means that the M-score for fraud detection cannot be applied among financial firms (banks, insurance). == Example of successful application == Enron Corporation was correctly identified as an earnings manipulator by students from Cornell University using M-score. Noticeably, Wall Street financial analysts were still recommending to buy Enron shares at that point in time. == Further reading on financial statement manipulation == * A sequence of articles on Alpha Architect blog. * An article on Investopedia about different types of financial statement manipulation (\"smoke and mirrors\", \"elder abuse\", \"fleeing town\", and others). == See also == * Data analysis techniques for fraud detection * Benford's law == References == Category:Corporate finance Category:Financial ratios Category:Financial risk management Category:Valuation (finance) ",
