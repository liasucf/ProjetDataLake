    "text": "Shore Action is a political ticket which contests the boards and council seats in the North Shore Ward of the Auckland Council. They have a strong focus on retention of local assets and investment in the natural environment, along with a focus on local participation in local body politics. Grant Gillon, a former Alliance Party MP, and AUT lecturer, along with Anne-Elise Smithson, a Community Development Coordinator for the Children's Autism Foundation, contested the North Shore Ward seat on the Auckland City Council. The wider team contested the local boards on the North Shore Ward. While neither Gillon nor Smithson won a council seat for the ward, Shore Action did win seats on the Devonport-Takapuna and Kaip\u0101tiki Local Boards, and the Birkenhead Licensing Trust. == Policies == Shore Action fought to retain the Takapuna Beach Holiday Park, opposing plans for a hard stand on the reserve. They also wish to save the Anzac St Carpark (currently home of the Takapuna Sunday Markets). They wish to invest in various environmental services by increasing volunteer networks, which they believe will aid in pest eradication and the reduction of pollution in urban streams and coastal areas. Smithson made the environment her central campaign platform and has stated: \u201cOur streams, bush and wildlife are struggling and our unique North Shore environment needs protecting as our city grows. Healthy ecosystems help our communities flourish\". In July 2018 Shore Action announced a significant funding boost for Kaip\u0101tiki environmental initiatives - securing $400,000 of funding for the 2018/19 financial year - a 38% increase towards environmental initiatives compared to the previous financial year. This increase would support clean streams, pest-free reserves, urban canopy protection, an open space management plan and a Kauri Dieback Strategy for Kaip\u0101tiki. Says Smithson: \u201cTwo-thirds of Auckland\u2019s native species are threatened with extinction and kauri could die out completely in the next 30 years. The time to act is now.\u201d In August 2019, Shore Action announced that the Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board had managed to secure 47% of the total Auckland-wide kauri budget to be spent in the Kaip\u0101tiki area. This would go towards upgrading bush tracks in kauri forest, and installing cleaning stations at track entrances. Throughout the instrumentation of their policies, Shore Action aims to keep their voters and ratepayers adequately informed. They also have a focus on better public transport, advocating for easing congestion on Lake Road as well as highlighting a need for heritage protection. Shore Action advocated for shade sails to be put up over all playgrounds in the area; the protection from the sun would allow the playgrounds to last longer and prevent the risk of skin cancer in children. == Elected representatives == === Current representatives === Shore Action holds seats on the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board, Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board, and the Birkenhead Licensing Trust. * John Gillon - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board * Paula Gillon - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board * Adrian Tyler - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board *Danielle Grant - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board *Melanie Kenrick - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board === Former representatives === * Lorene Pigg - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board 2013-2016 (Team of Independents) *Grant Gillon - Devonport-Takapuna Local Board (2013-2019), Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board (2013-2016) * Jan O'Connor - Devonport-Takapuna Local Board (2013-2019) ran on another ticket in 2019. * Anne-Elise Smithson - Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board (2016-2019) == Election results == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election ! colspan=\"4\" |Candidates nominated ! colspan=\"4\" |Seats won |- style=\"text-align:center;\" !North Shore Ward !Devonport-Takapuna Local Board !Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board !Birkenhead Licensing Trust !North Shore Ward !Devonport-Takapuna Local Board !Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board !Birkenhead Licensing Trust |- !2013 |1/2 |2/6 |4/8 |1/6 | | | | |- !2016 |2/2 |5/6 |6/8 |1/6 | | | | |- !2019 |2/2 (As More for the Shore) |Did Not contest |6/8 |Did not contest | |Did not contest | | (As Your Community Trust) |} === 2013 local body elections === Many of those who contested the 2016 local elections for Shore Action had contested the 2013 local elections under the ticket 'Team of Independents' alongside Grant and John Gillon. Shore Action holds the same values as 'Team of Independents'; Shore Action came as a re-branding of the same issues but with an increased focus on defending the natural environment. Shore Action retains a focus within the North Shore Ward, whereas Team of Independents supported a candidate beyond the North Shore for the Upper Harbour Local Board. Of the two candidates that ran for the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board both were elected. However, only three of the four which ran for the Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board won. The only candidate to contest the Upper Harbour Local Board, did not win. Gillon did not win his council bid, and came fourth in his attempt to win one of the two seats. The following are the 2013 local body election results for Team of Independents. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Candidacy !Votes !Elected |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Grant Gillon |North Shore Ward Councillor |12,273 | bgcolor=\"#FFE8E8\" |\u2718 |- |Devonport-Takapuna Local Board |7,185 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |- |Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board |9,800 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |- |Jan O'Connor |Devonport-Takapuna Local Board |6,774 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |- |John Gillon |Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board |7,384 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |- |Gary Stephen Thornton |Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board |3,383 | bgcolor=\"#FFE8E8\" |\u2718 |- |Lorene Pigg |Kaip\u0101tiki Local Board |6,631 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |- |Uzra Casuri Balouch |Upper Harbour Local Board |3,530 | bgcolor=\"#FFE8E8\" |\u2718 |- |Paula Gillon |Birkenhead Licensing Trust |4410 | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |\u2714 |} === 2016 local body elections === ==== Auckland Council - North Shore ward ==== Grant Gillon ran alongside Anne-Elise Smithson to contest the 2 available seats on the council.
