During World War II a dense network of military defences were built in the area due to Hopton's close proximity to Great Yarmouth. These included anti-tank defences, pillboxes, air-raid shelters and a coastal battery. Constructed in 1940 this battery had a pair of large gun houses, for six-inch guns, and search-lights. The site was armed during and after the war, until August 1947, due to its prime location for an invasion.World War Two Emergency Coastal Battery at Gorleston Golf Links ==Geography== The village is on the East Anglia coast, on the North Sea, it has a wide sandy beach Hopton-on-Sea Beach which runs by grassy cliffs. The beach suffers from coastal erosion and, as of 2016, sand levels have dropped by 10 ft in the last five years.
