Section: Data of the Spanish representation. == Historical relations == Christopher Columbus arrived in Dominica on November 3 on 1493, being the first island discovered on his second trip to America. The name with which Columbus baptizes the island is derived from the name of the day of the week in which they see the island, Sunday. Spanish ships arrived frequently during the 16th century, but fierce resistance by the Caribs deterred Spain from their efforts to settle there. == Diplomatic relations == Bilateral relations are concentrated in the framework of Dominica's membership of international organizations, regional cooperation projects and in the exchange of support for candidates in multilateral organizations. The cooperation is channeled in general terms through the Spain-CARICOM Joint Fund of AECID, which executes projects of regional scope. Although no specific project is being developed on the island, Dominica benefits from regional projects, such as the Center of Excellence for Advanced Technology in Agriculture CEATA (Jamaica).Ficha de Dominica Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Diplomatic relations. == Economic relations == There is practically no bilateral trade. The main products that Spain exports to Dominica vary greatly depending on the years without a consistent pattern of export specialization in the last four years. It also happens in imports from Dominica, where the figures that are shuffled are very small. In 2012 and 2013, the main Spanish exports to Dominica have been industrial technology, textiles and pharmaceuticals.Ficha de Dominica Office of Diplomatic Information.

Dominica benefits from projects of regional scope, such as the Regional Center for Advanced Technologies for High-Performance Crops (CEATA) for training in new agricultural technologies, in process of execution in Jamaica. In terms of health, preferential attention is given to noncommunicable diseases, an area less attended by other donors. The \"Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Project\" (program of noncommunicable diseases) stands out for its cross- cutting gender component, having already held 2 regional training seminars in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, in the months of June and July 2009 with provision of colposcopes for all CARICOM countries. Specifically, Princess Margaret Hospital de Roseau received the donation of a colposcope in 2010. From the Spanish Embassy in Dominica, with residence in Kingston, a work to support the teaching of Spanish is carried out through the donation of AVE scholarships for learning Spanish. Because Dominica is among the Caribbean countries that will soon benefit from a Schengen visa exemption, Spain organized a seminar on this subject in Madrid in May 2014, which was attended by an expert from Dominica. The Minister of Tourism of Dominica, Ian Douglas, participated in the High Level Seminar on Innovative Practices in Tourism for the Caribbean held in Madrid from June 9 to 14, 2014.
