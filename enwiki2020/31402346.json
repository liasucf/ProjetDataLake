WWE continued to display the vignettes of her upcoming return the following weeks. In late 2016 and again in early 2017, journalist Dave Meltzer described the vignettes as merely a running inside joke, and stated that \"there's no spot ready for her\" on television. Reportedly, the Emmalina gimmick was dropped due to WWE producers feeling that Dashwood could not pull off the character with the direction they would like to display it, which was to be a throwback to the likes of Sable and The Kat.

On 29 October 2017, WWE announced that Dashwood has officially been released from her WWE contract. === Independent circuit (2017\u20132020) === In November 2017, several independent promotions announced they had signed Dashwood to perform at their shows, beginning in February 2018.
