    "text": "On May 1 the United States officially recognizes Law Day. It is meant to reflect on the role of law in the foundation of the country and to recognize its importance for society. ==History== Before President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared May 1 to be Law Day, U.S.A., the first day of May was known in some parts of the world as May Day: a day to remember the struggles of workers in their fight for better wages and working conditions. Law Day was originally the idea of Charles S. Rhyne, Eisenhower's legal counsel for a time, who was serving in 1957\u20131958 as president of the American Bar Association.ABA Journal, May 2008. Eisenhower proclaimed May 1 to be Law Day, U.S.A. in 1958.Law Day \u2013 May 1st (Law Library of Congress) Its observance was later codified by Public Law 87-20 on April 7, 1961.Notes on 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 113 Cornell Law School Some countries celebrate May Day on the same date, as it is designated Labour Day or International Workers Day. But on February 5, 1958, President Eisenhower recognized the first Law Day when he proclaimed that henceforth May 1 of each year would be Law Day in the United States. He stated: \"In a very real sense, the world no longer has a choice between force and law. If civilization is to survive it must choose the rule of law.\"David Ray Papke, \"Law, Cinema, and Ideology: Hollywood Legal Films of the 1950s\", 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1473, 1490 (2001). Today, many local bars and legal education associations, such as the Florida Law Related Education Association and the New York State Bar Association, use Law Day as a legal education tool, especially for students. The day has been criticized as being intended to reduce the influence of May Day, a holiday that originated with a workers revolt in the 1800s. Like Earth Day, Law Day is not a government holiday. To celebrate Law Day, some local bar associations hold a luncheon, featuring speakers who discuss topics such as justice or the liberties provided for by the United States Constitution. Also, attorneys might visit schools and talk to students about the American legal system. The American Bar Association designates a theme to highlight an important issue relating to the law or legal system. The 2014 theme was American Democracy and the Rule of Law: Why Every Vote Matters. The theme reflects the importance of voting rights, ballot box accessibility and voter engagement. The ABA provides resources on its Law Day website, www.lawday.org, to mark the occasion, and also holds several national Law Day programs in Washington, D.C., on April 30 and May 1. ==Codification== 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 113 states, in part:36 U.S.C. \u00a7 113 Cornell Law School :Law Day, U.S.A., is a special day of celebration by the people of the United States\u2014 :(1) in appreciation of their liberties and the reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United States and of their rededication to the ideals of equality and justice under law in their relations with each other and with other countries; and :(2) for the cultivation of the respect for law that is so vital to the democratic way of life. ==See also== * Law Day Address * May Day * International Workers' Day * Labour Day * Loyalty Day * Holidays of the United States ==References== ==External links== * American Bar Association * United States Library of Congress * Presidential Law Day Proclamations, 1958-2013 * Presidential Law Day Proclamations, 2001-present Category:May observances Category:Observances in the United States by presidential proclamation Category:Recurring events established in 1958 ",
