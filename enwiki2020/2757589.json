Many of her experiences and observations are collected in her blog \"feminist-original\". Ku has been active in the movement since the mid-1970s. In 1982 Ku and a group of colleagues who supported gender equality established the magazine Awakening to encourage women's self-awareness and to raise public concern about women's issues. This project was followed in 1987 by the Awakening Foundation with the intention of mobilizing more women, improving their social conditions and striving for their rights. After returning from the 1985 Nairobi conference, Ku and other women's studies scholars formed the Women's Research Program at National Taiwan University. She served as chair of the Awakening Foundation from 1997\u20131998 and became the first femocrat in Taiwan in the end of 1998. == Selected works == * * * * == References == Category:Indiana University alumni Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:Claremont Graduate University alumni Category:Taiwanese feminists Category:1948 births Category:Living people ",
