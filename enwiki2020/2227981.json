    "text": "Riohacha (), Rio Hacha or Rio de la Hacha ( - Wayuu: S\u00fcchiimma, \"S\u00fcchii\" means river, and \"mma\" means land, Riverland), is a city in the Riohacha Municipality in the northern Caribbean Region of Colombia by the mouth of the Rancher\u00eda River and the Caribbean Sea. It is the capital city of the La Guajira Department. It has a sandy beach waterfront. Founded by conquistador Nikolaus Federmann in 1535, Riohacha was named after a local legend, \"The legend of the Axe\". Because of the powerful rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the area is mostly desertic. It is inhabited primarily by Amerindians, predominantly the Wayuu ethnic group. During colonial times, Riohacha was a very important port, as divers could retrieve vast numbers of pearls from the harbor. In the second half of the 20th century, the city developed as one of Colombia's medium important, maritime commercial ports. It is also a multicultural center for La Guajira Department. The city is mentioned several times in novels written by Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Among his important works are One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera, and Chronicle of a Death Foretold. ==History== Cathedral of Riohacha The Riohacha area was long inhabited by American Indians of the Wayuu culture, part of the larger Arawak group. The first European to visit the area was the Spanish sailor Alonso de Ojeda in 1498, though he never landed. A short time later, Juan de la Cosa, another Spanish explorer, landed on what is today called Cabo de la Vela (Cape of the Sail, so called because of its shape). In 1535, the German explorer Nikolaus Federmann founded a city with the name Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Maria de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela (Our Lady Saint Mary of the Remedies of the Cape of the Sail) at the place where de la Cosa had landed. The Spanish discovered a vast amount of pearls in the city's area. This treasure frequently attracted raids by pirates. After the city was destroyed by a pirate raid, the city government relocated the city to the mouth of the Rancher\u00eda River, in order to confuse the pirates, and to give the city time to rebuild before the next attack. The new city, named Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Remedios del R\u00edo de la Hacha (Our Lady of the Remedies), expanded peacefully for a short time in its new location. Pirate attacks soon resumed. The next major attack, led by the famous English pirate Francis Drake, took place in 1569, when Drake pillaged the city searching for gold and pearls. In the 18th century, Riohacha was incorporated to the Viceroyalty of New Granada as part of the province of Santa Marta. During the battles for independence from Spain, the port of Riohacha served many vessels fighting for Colombian and Venezuelan independence. Many Riohachans also served in the revolutionary navy, most notably Admiral Jos\u00e9 Prudencio Padilla, who would come to be considered a hero in the revolutions of Colombia and Venezuela. In 1954, Riohacha City acquired municipality status, and in 1964 was declared capital of the new La Guajira Department.

This rain falls almost exclusively in May and between August and November, and for the rest of the year there are a mere thirteen wet days out of 212 in an average year. Despite the lack of rainfall, humidity is high year round and adds to the uncomfortable heat. ==Notable People== *Luis Antonio Robles Su\u00e1rez, first Afro-Colombian lawyer and politician. ==Gallery== File:Riohachacity.jpg|View of the beachfront File:Colombia-riohacha001.JPG|Malecon Beach File:Colombie- riohacha003.jpg|Typical building File:Colombie-riohacha004.jpg|Colombian Wayuu craft on Avenida Primera (1st Ave.) File:Colombie-riohacha005.jpg|Riohacha's Touristic Dock File:Riohacha.jpg|Riohacha's Sunrise at a house roof File:Rancher\u00eda River Mouth in Riohacha.jpg|Rancher\u00eda River empties into Riohacha File:Convento de los padres capuchinos, Riohacha Colombia.png|Ca\u00f1ones Park File:Riohacha Carrera 6.jpg|One of the areas of the historic center of the city File:Riohacha artesania.JPG|Identidad Monument, eriged in 2010 File:Centro Cultural Riohacha (Visto desde la playa) - panoramio.jpg|Departmental Cultural Center seen from the beach File:Antigua Aduana y Actual Secretar\u00eda de Cultura de Riohacha.jpg|Late Nineteen Century Building in Riohacha File:Casa M\u00e1rquez Iguar\u00e1n en Riohacha.jpg|House where Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was conceived, according to his autobiography Living to Tell the Tale (2002) File:Interior de la Universidad de La Guajira.jpg|La Guajira University, located in Riohacha File:Alijuna y Way\u00fa.jpg|Fishing between Alijuna and Way\u00fa Caribbean coast, Riohacha ==References== ==External links== * Gobernacion de La Guajira - Riohacha * Riohacha official website Category:Port cities in the Caribbean Category:Municipalities of La Guajira Department Category:Capitals of Colombian departments Category:1535 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Populated places established in 1535 ",
