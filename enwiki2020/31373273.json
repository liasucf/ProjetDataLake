Their antics take place in the fictional Balsa City, and often at the local supermarket the Stash \"N\" Hoard, where Scaredy works as a stacker. ==Characters== * Scaredy (voiced by Terry McGurrin) \u2013 A smart, germophobic, and occasionally shy flying squirrel who works as a stacker at a grocery store called Stash \"N\" Hoard and is fond of cleaning. * David \"Dave\" Skunkerton Weeb (voiced by Jonathan Gould) \u2013 Scaredy's best friend who is a blue skunk. He is also dim-witted and is fond of being messy and farting. * Nestor (voiced by Patrick McKenna) \u2013 Nestor is a yellow canary who is the manager of Stash \"N\" Hoard. He is also Scaredy's boss and one of his frenemies. * Momma (voiced by Jayne Eastwood) \u2013 A grouchy pastel pink canary who owns the Stash \"N\" Hoard, and who is Nestor's mother.
