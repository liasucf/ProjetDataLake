    "text": "Yann Domenech (born March 17, 1979 in Valr\u00e9as) is a retired French long jumper. Representing his nation France at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Domenech registered his best jump at 8.28 m from the Lyon-Parilly Athletics Meet in V\u00e9nissieux two months before the Games. Throughout his career in track and field, Domenech trained for AC Bourg Saint And\u00e9ol in Pierrelatte, under his personal coach Christian Branchereau. Domenech qualified for the French squad in the men's long jump at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by successfully jumping an Olympic A-standard of 8.28 m from the Lyon-Parilly Athletics Meet in V\u00e9nissieux. During the prelims, Domenech spanned his opening legal jump at 7.56 m, until he smoothly extended it to 7.73 m on his second attempt. Since his third leap produced a cautious foul, Domenech finished only in twenty- eighth out of forty-one athletes, and did not advance past the qualifying round. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:French male long jumpers Category:Olympic athletes of France Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:People from Valr\u00e9as Category:Sportspeople from Vaucluse ",
