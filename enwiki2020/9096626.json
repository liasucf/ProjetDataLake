    "text": "ICC World Cricket League Division Five is the lowest current division in the World Cricket League (WCL) system. Like all other divisions, Division Five is contested as a standalone tournament rather than as an actual league. The inaugural Division Five tournament was held in 2008, hosted by Jersey, and featured 12 teams. For the next four tournaments (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016), the number of teams was fixed at six. The 2017 competition involved eight teams. Because the WCL operates on a system of promotion and relegation, teams have generally only participated in one or two Division Five tournaments before being either promoted to Division Four or relegated to Division Six. Overall, 25 teams have qualified for at least one Division Five tournament. Afghanistan and Nepal have progressed from Division Five to the World Cup Qualifier, the only teams to do so from such a low starting division. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text- align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=2 width=10%|Year ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Host(s) ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Venue(s) ! colspan=3|Final |- ! width=18%|Winner ! width=24%|Result ! width=18%|Runner-up |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2008 | | various | 81/8 (37.4 overs) | Afghanistan won by 2 wickets scorecard | 80 (39.5 overs) |- | 2010 | | Kathmandu Valley | 175/7 (46.5 overs) | Nepal won by 5 wickets scorecard | 172 (47.2 overs) |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2012 | | Singapore | 164/1 (26.4 overs) | Singapore won by 9 wickets scorecard | 159 (47 overs) |- | 2014 | | Kuala Lumpur | 247/8 (50 overs) | Jersey won by 71 runs scorecard | 176 (44.4 overs) |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2016 | | Saint Saviour | 194/7 (50 overs) | Jersey won by 44 runs scorecard | 150 (45.3 overs) |- | 2017 | | Benoni | 255 (48 overs) | Jersey won by 120 runs scorecard | 135 (36.5 overs) |} ==Performance by team== ;Legend * \u2013 Champions * \u2013 Runners- up * \u2013 Third place *Q \u2013 Qualified * -- Hosts {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" ! width=150|Team ! 2008 ! 2010 ! 2012 ! 2014 ! 2016 ! 2017 !
