    "text": "Hong Kong has a long coastline that is full of twists and turns with many bays and beaches. Many of them are well sheltered by mountains nearby, as Hong Kong is a mountainous place. As a result, large waves seldom appear at the bays, making them suitable for human swimming. However, with the increasing development and urbanisation of Hong Kong, water quality has worsened resulting in the closure of several beaches previously suitable for swimming. These include Approach Beach, Ting Kau Beach, Anglers' Beach, Gemini Beaches, Hoi Mei Wan Beach, Casam Beach and Lido Beach in Tsuen Wan. In 2011, Lido Beach, Casam Beach, Approach Beach and Hoi Mei Wan Beach were reopened following an improvement in water quality.\"Four beaches in Tsuen Wan to reopen with improved water quality\", Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Press Release, June 13, 2011 About half of the beaches suitable for swimming in Hong Kong are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and are officially referred to as gazetted beaches. A number of other beaches are privately owned or not gazetted, but are nonetheless publicly accessible. == Gazetted beaches == A total of forty-one beaches in Hong Kong are managed by the LCSD. Twelve of them are located on Hong Kong Island, and the remaining 29 are located across the New Territories, including the Outlying Islands. Some are temporarily closed to swimmers. === Full list === ;Tuen Mun District 1\\. Butterfly Beach () 2\\. Castle Peak Beach () 3\\. Kadoorie Beach () 4\\. Cafeteria Old Beach () 5\\.

See Deep Water Bay. ==== Repulse Bay Beach ==== Repulse Bay Beach (), traditionally Hong Kong's most popular because of its easy access by bus and extensive facilities, is located on southern Hong Kong Island. See Repulse Bay. ==== Middle Bay Beach and South Bay Beach ==== These two small beaches at South Bay and Middle Bay are located within walking distance of Repulse Bay Beach. However, since they are not directly accessible by public transport, they tend to be quieter and less crowded than Repulse Bay. ==== Turtle Cove Beach ==== The beach situated east of Stanley and west of Tai Tam Reservoir is Turtle Cove Beach () which is a Grade 1 beach. Being less than 70 meters long, it can easily be considered as a \"baby beach\". Turtle Cove is very well equipped; with changing rooms, toilets and showers as well as a small playground, a soft drinks kiosk and seven barbecue pits. Turtle Cove Beach is accessible by bus No.14 from exit A of the Sai Wan Ho MTR station or mini-bus 16X from Chai Wan; the beach is located near the Red Hill estate stop (past the Tai Tam Reservoir). From near the bus stop, stairs lead down the hill to the beach. ==== Big Wave Bay Beach==== Big Wave Bay Beach () in Southern District is also the site of prehistoric rock carvings similar to those found on Cheung Chau Island.C.Michael Hogan, 2007, Cheung Chau Rock Carvings, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham Not to be confused with other places called Big Wave Bay or Tai Long Wan in Hong Kong. === Lamma Island === ==== Hung Shing Yeh Beach ==== Hung Shing Yeh Beach () is the most popular beach on Lamma Island. The sand on the beach is very fine, like powder. The water of the Beach is clean and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. Near the beach, there is a barbecue area, refreshment kiosk, and shower and changing facilities. There is no public transport on Lamma Island. To reach the beach one must travel to Yung Shue Wan from Central by ferry, and then walk for about 20 minutes. The route is signposted. ==== Lo So Shing Beach ==== Lo So Shing Beach () is located on Lamma Island about halfway between the main villages of Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan. The water of the beach is clean and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. Some years ago the government of Hong Kong built shower and refreshment facilities there, which remain almost unused because of the beach's remote location and the absence of public transport. To reach the beach one must travel to Yung Shue Wan or Sok Kwu Wan from Central by ferry, and then walk for about 40 minutes. === Cheung Chau === ==== Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach and Kwun Yam Beach ==== Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach There are two main beaches on Cheung Chau: Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach () and Kwun Yam Beach () aka. Afternoon Beach. Although they are not as big as the well- known beaches along the Hong Kong Island coast, they do have their own qualities. Kwun Yam Beach is a beautiful fine white beach situated on the east coast of Cheung Chau. The water quality is good and it is classified as a Grade 1 beach. It provides many water sports facilities, particularly for sailboarding. Many lovers like to take leisurely walks there and to enjoy the village scene which still keeps the old traditions. Also, it is the place where Hong Kong's first Olympic medallist, Lee Lai Shan, practised when she was young. A formal monument to her achievement is erected in the children's playground on Tung Wan Beach, while an unofficial monument is to be found beside the \"windsurfer\" caf\u00e9 owned by her uncle, which is situated between the two beaches. === Lantau Island === ==== Silvermine Bay Beach ==== Silvermine Bay Beach Hong Kong's largest island, Lantau, has several beaches which are clean, uncrowded and relatively convenient to reach. For all of them, the first step is to simply take the ferry from Central to Mui Wo. Then, if necessary, one can just hop on a bus. Silvermine Bay Beach (), which is a Grade 1 beach, is the easiest one to get to, since it is located about a 5-minute walk away from the Mui Wo ferry pier. Since there is a sandbar area, this beach is ideal for flinging frisbees or flying kites. Further along the beach is a swimming area with several lifeguards on duty. Many visitors rent a bike for the afternoon, and stop off at the many refreshment kiosks and little restaurants along the road fronting the beach. If people do not feel like hurrying back into the city, they can also choose to stay overnight at the Silvermine Beach Hotel, located right on the waterfront. Also, there are several other hotels and guesthouses in the area where people can stay. ==== Pui O Beach ==== ==== Cheung Sha Beaches ==== View over Lower Cheung Sha Beach. The islet in the middle of the bay is Cha Kwo Chau (). Cheung Sha Beach is located in Cheung Sha, on the southern shore of Lantau Island. It is divided into two parts by a small headland: Upper Cheung Sha Beach (east) and Lower Cheung Sha Beach (west). It is 3 km long and is one of the longest beaches in Hong Kong.Time Out Hong Kong: \"Get Out: Cheung Sha Beach\" , 8 May 2009 The beaches are accessible from South Lantau Road.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Lower Cheung Sha Beach Tong Fuk Beach is located nearby, to the west of Lower Cheung Sha Beach. ==== Tong Fuk Beach ==== == Non- gazetted beaches == Many of these beaches are difficult to reach. Because they are not maintained by the government, some may be unclean at times. As no lifeguards are on duty, swimmers are recommended to exercise caution. Non- gazetted beaches are also not equipped with shark nets. #Chung Wan () South Crooked Harbour, North District #Cheung Sha Wan () Northeast Ping Chau #Crescent Bay () Crescent Island, Mirs Bay #Lo Kei Wan () Crescent Island, Mirs Bay #Tung Wan () Wong Wan Chau, Mirs Bay #Wu Kai Sha () Wu Kai Sha, Ma On Shan #Lung Mei () Plover Cove, East Tai Po #Hoi Ha Wan () Hoi Ha Wan, North Sai Kung Peninsula #Nam She Wan () East Sai Kung, Mirs Bay #Tung Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Tai Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Ham Tin Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Tai Long Sai Wan () East Sai Kung, Tai Long Wan #Long Ke Wan () Long Ke Wan, East Sai Kung #Long Ke Tsai () Long Ke Wan, East Sai Kung #Pak Sha Chau () Sai Kung Hoi, Sai Kung #Pak Lap Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Ma Tau Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Kam Lo Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Nam Fung Wan () High Island, South Sai Kung #Kau Sai Wan () Kau Sai Chau, Sai Kung #Whiskey () Kau Sai Chau, Sai Kung #Campers' Bay () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Pak Shui Wun () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Bayside () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Little Palm () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Lung Ha Wan () Port Shelter, Clearwater Bay #Ung Kong Wan () Bluff Island, Clearwater Bay #Lung Kwu Upper () Lung Kwu Tan, west Tuen Mun #Lung Kwu Lower () Lung Kwu Tan, Tuen Mun #Dragon Bay () Tsing Lung Tau, Tsuen Wan #To Tei Wan () Shek O, Cape D'Aguilar #Tai Pak Wan () Discovery Bay, East Lantau Island #Tai Long Wan () Chi Ma Wan, South Lantau Island #Yi Long Wan () Chi Ma Wan, South Lantau Island #Sha Lo Wan () West Tung Chung, North Lantau Island #Tai Long Wan () Shek Pik, South Lantau Island #Lo Kei Wan () Shui Hau, South Lantau Island #Kau Ling Chung () Fan Lau, Southwest Lantau Island #Fan Lau Tung Wan () Fan Lau, Southwest Lantau Island #Fan Lan Sai Wan () Fan Lau,Jules Brown and Dinah Gardner, Hong Kong and Macau, page 187 Southwest Lantau Island #Luk Keng Wan () Yam O, Northeast Lantau Island #Tai Kwai Wan () Northwest Cheung Chau #Po Yue Wan () Southwest Cheung Chau #Pak Tso Wan () Southwest Cheung Chau #Shek Pai Wan () Southeast Lamma Island #Mo Tat wan () East Lamma Island #Kwo Chau Wan () Tai Chau, Ninepin Group #Siu A Chau Wan () Siu A Chau, Soko Islands == Water quality grading system == Gazetted beaches in Hong Kong are classified into four grades ( Grades 1 \u2013 4 ) according to the level of E. coli in the water of the beaches. This is done by the Environmental Protection Department. Every week, water samples of each beach are collected for analysis to find out their bacterial level. Grade 1 means that the water qualities of the beaches are good. The amount of E. coli is no more than 24 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also no related case of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses has been reported by swimmers who have swum at these beaches. Grade 2 means that the water qualities of the beaches are fair. The amount of E. coli is about 25 \u2013 180 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is no more than 10 cases per 1000 swimmers. Grade 3 means that the water qualities of the beaches are poor. The amount of E. coli is about 181 \u2013 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is about 11 \u2013 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. Grade 4 means that the water quality is very poor. The amount of E. coli is greater than 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is greater than 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. As a result, swimmers are advised not to swim at Grade 4 beaches. ==See also== * List of beaches * Environment of Hong Kong * Geography of Hong Kong * Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas * List of buildings, sites and areas in Hong Kong * Shark net * Swimming shed ==References== ==External links== *Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Public Beaches on Hong Kong Island *Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Public Beaches in the New Territories *Environmental Protection Department *Grading of beach water quality *Beaches of Hong Kong, from HK-place.com Category:Places in Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong geography-related lists Hong Kong Category:Lists of landforms of Hong Kong Category:Swimming in Hong Kong ",
