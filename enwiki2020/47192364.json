These coins bore no face values and were passed by weight.P. Avery, B. G. Fragner, J. B. Simmons (15 December 1982), \"\u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b\", in: Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, Vol. I, Fasc. 1, p. 86.

While the Iranian abbasi was also widespread in eastern Georgia, which was under the Iranian sway, the coin soon after also came to be minted at the mint in Tiflis (Tbilisi), where they were colloquially known as abazi. After the Russian annexation of eastern Georgia in 1801, abbasi denominations (one-half abbasi--Muhammad; one quarter abbasi--shahi; one-tenth abbasi--bisti; 1/200th abbasi--dinar) influenced production of the new currency, the Georgian silver (kartuli tetri). == See also == * Georgian abazi == References == ==Bibliography== * Category:Modern obsolete currencies Category:Denominations (currency) Category:Currencies of Iran Category:Safavid Empire ",
