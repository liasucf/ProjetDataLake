    "text": "Carlos Casta\u00f1o Gil (May 16, 1965 \u2013 April 16, 2004) was a Colombian paramilitary leader and drug trafficker who was a founder of the Peasant Self- Defenders of C\u00f3rdoba and Urab\u00e1 (ACCU), a far-right paramilitary organization in Colombia and a former member of the Medellin Cartel. Casta\u00f1o and his brothers Fidel and Vicente founded the ACCU (and its previous incarnations) after their father was kidnapped and killed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), in association with other enemies or victims of the guerrillas. The ACCU later became one of the founding members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). == First years == Carlos Casta\u00f1o Gil was the youngest son of the family Casta\u00f1o Gil, which mainly raised livestock. Like his brothers, he experienced firsthand the murder of his father and Jesus Casta\u00f1o. Led by his older brother Fidel, he became a member of self-defense groups, which were among the first of their kind. He was introduced to Medellin Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar by his brother Fidel, and their friendship became close. Casta\u00f1o received combat training from his brother, from army officers and employees of the paramilitary group as well as from the Israeli mercenary Yair Klein. Casta\u00f1o opposed financing paramilitary groups through drug trafficking. The friendship between the Casta\u00f1o brothers and Pablo Escobar broke when the latter sent assassins against the Casta\u00f1o while being detained inside his personal prison \"La Catedral\". Casta\u00f1o and his brothers then became founders of the group \"Los Pepes\" (an acronym for \"people persecuted by Pablo Escobar\"). During this time Carlos was known by the aliases of \"the Phantom\" or \"the Kid\". Contacts between Los Pepes and the Colombian National Police Search Bloc allegedly resulted in Escobar's demise and killing. Two months after the death of Escobar, Fidel Casta\u00f1o was killed in a battle against the EPL guerrilla. However, it is believed that Carlos may have had a role in Fidel's death in retaliation for the alleged rape and murder (or possible suicide) of Rumalda Casta\u00f1o, a woman alleged to have been a lover of both brothers. After Fidel's death, Carlos Casta\u00f1o assumed leadership of AUC, a paramilitary federation. ==AUC leader== In a 1996 interview with writer Robin Kirk, later published in More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia (PublicAffairs: New York, 2003), Casta\u00f1o acknowledged that the men under his command committed \"excesses\", but defended them as necessary in Colombia's conflict. \"Look, the guerrillas hide themselves within the civilian population, they manipulate the population\". In a September 1997 interview in El Tiempo newspaper, Casta\u00f1o admitted responsibility for the Mapirip\u00e1n massacre.US Department of State, Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Washington DC, 1998. In 1997, Casta\u00f1o later founded an umbrella organization of paramilitaries operating in Colombia known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). The AUC demobilized in 2006 admitting to several brutal murders to the Colombian population. The AUC was accused by human rights organizations of committing atrocities, and it has openly admitted to its involvement in the drug trade. The AUC was listed by the US Department of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. AUC was disbanded after then Colombian President Alvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez reached a peace agreement with reduced terms for its members. Casta\u00f1o was convicted in absentia of the murder of journalist Jaime Garz\u00f3n, and sentenced to 38 years in prison. ==Accusations of narcotrafficking== On September 24, 2002, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Casta\u00f1o which accused him of trafficking over 17 tons of cocaine into the United States. Casta\u00f1o announced that he would give himself up for trial in the United States and would accept his participation in numerous crimes, though he resented his being personally linked to the drug trade. Casta\u00f1o had become isolated from the organization according to some observers, as he seemed to become relatively critical of the AUC's increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and was more willing to compromise with the Colombian Government. Allegedly this caused some AUC commanders to turn their backs on him. Casta\u00f1o stated on Colombian television in 2000 that 70 percent of AUC funds came from narcotrafficking. ==Disappearance and death== Casta\u00f1o was killed on April 16, 2004. Acting AUC commanders claimed initially that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters. Other sources within the group and among its dissident factions claimed that he and his men were captured and tortured before being killed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother Vicente Casta\u00f1o and Diego Murillo AKA \"Don Berna\"), who had become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Colombian investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Casta\u00f1o's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources alleged that the bodies of Casta\u00f1o and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive. The possible death of the AUC co-founder remained in the air and was the subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the rumours, dating from June 1, 2004, stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Casta\u00f1o may have been spirited away to either Israel or Egypt, via Panama, allegedly with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced and the parties allegedly involved separately denied their participation. Sources from the AUC and other local militant factions continued to dispute the exact whereabouts of Carlos Casta\u00f1o. His personal and financial connections between narcotraffickers and other sectors of society could have allowed for their possible collaboration in his conspicuous disappearance or murder. Despite these claims, the truth regarding Casta\u00f1o's exact condition remained unknown. On August 23, 2006, Colombia's Attorney General publicly ordered the capture of his brother Vicente Casta\u00f1o and seven other individuals, accusing them of being involved in Carlos Casta\u00f1o's apparent death. Alleged witnesses to the crime stated that Casta\u00f1o's body was apparently dismembered and incinerated.El Tiempo. \"Fiscal\u00eda orden\u00f3 captura de Jos\u00e9 Vicente Casta\u00f1o por la muerte de su hermano Carlos\". August 23, 2006. Available online. Accessed October 23, 2016.El Pais. \"Vicente Casta\u00f1o habr\u00eda matado a su hermano\". Available online. Accessed October 23, 2016 Casta\u00f1o's skeleton was recovered from a shallow grave on September 1, 2006, and identified through DNA testing by the Colombian government authorities. His brother's second lieutenant named Jes\u00fas Rold\u00e1n AKA \"MonoLeche\", a former Popular Liberation Army (Ej\u00e9rcito Popular de Liberaci\u00f3n) guerrilla who later joined the paramilitaries, confessed to his murder and led authorities to the grave. ==Popular culture== Casta\u00f1o is portrayed by the actor Mauricio Mej\u00eda as the character of Adolfo Aguilar \"El Halc\u00f3n\" in TV series El Cartel, Mej\u00eda also portrays Casta\u00f1o in the Netflix original television series Narcos. David Nore\u00f1a portrays Casta\u00f1o as the character of Lucio Moreno in the TV series Escobar, el patr\u00f3n del mal. Casta\u00f1o is also portrayed by the actor Juli\u00e1n Rom\u00e1n in TV series Los Tres Ca\u00ednes. ==See also== *United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia *Paramilitarism in Colombia *Colombian Armed Conflict ==References== ==Further reading== ===Journal articles=== * McDermott, Jeremy \"Colombian paramilitary leader murdered\", Janes Intelligence Review; June 2004, Vol. 16 Issue 6, pp. 8\u20139 Category:1965 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Amalfi, Antioquia Category:Members of the United Self- Defense Forces of Colombia Category:Warlords Category:Colombian drug traffickers Category:Colombian people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Colombia Category:Place of death unknown ",
