They were concerned for the safety of the children who needed to cross the railway tracks to attend school at Admiral Seymour Elementary in the Strathcona neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\"Militant Mothers of Raymur\" March 24, 1971 PROVINCE page 29 The tracks were owned by Burlington Northern Railway and were used mainly by Canadian National Railways to move cars between its yard and the Vancouver waterfront. About 400 children crossed the tracks to and from school every day.\"Militant Mothers Win\" Winnipeg Free Press Tuesday, January 12, 1971 > Page 28 The women had been advocating for a safe crossing for several months, had circulated a petition and attended many meetings, with no results. They asked the train company not to run trains while children were travelling to and from school. They were angry that the safety of their children was not a priority and worried that a child would be hurt by the trains. They saw their children climbing between the slow-moving trains to cross the tracks. The Raymur Place Social Housing Project (now Stamps Place), where many of the families lived, is a social housing project in a poor neighbourhood and not considered a priority by those in power.\"Vancouver mothers' battle for kids' safety takes centre stage\" By ERIKA THORKELSON, The Vancouver Sun, October 27, 2014, CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc. Finally, they set up camp on the railway tracks near Pender and Raymur, blocking train traffic. They had signs that read \"Children vs. Profit\" and \"Petitions Don't Work.\" The mothers included Judith Stainsby, Carol Jerome (sister of Olympians Harry and Valerie Jerome), Alice Hamilton (mother of activist Jamie Lee Hamilton), Barbara Burnet, Joan Morelli, Sheila Turgeon, Muggs Sigurgeirson, Babs Cain, Liisa Atva (a teenager at the time) and others.\"Mothers who made a difference\" Daphne Bramham Vancouver Sun July 25, 2011, CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc. Local politicians and the train companies were forced to find a solution. Train officials promised to stop running trains during the children's crossing time. City officials promised to build a pedestrian overpass. Since the women were aware that promises made are not always fulfilled, they intermittently blocked the tracks until construction began. By Sept 1971, the overpass was built. The \"Militant Mothers of Raymur\" also created the Ray-Cam Cooperative Centre as a food sharing co-operative and place for their children to play. ==Artistic portrayals== In 2014, a theatrical musical called The Raymur Mothers tells the tale of these women and their blockade. It was one performance in a series entitled Untold Stories of Vancouver. There is a mosaic on the sidewalk at Campbell and Keefer streets that says \"The Militant Mothers of Raymur\" and depicts women standing on train tracks in front of a train.\"Strathcona: A sense of community\" Daphne Bramham Vancouver Sun July 21, 2011, CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.
