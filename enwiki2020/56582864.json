    "text": "', provisional designation and cometary designation , is an asteroid and main- belt comet from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 31 January 2003, by astronomers of the LONEOS program conducted at Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. == Orbit and classification == is a main-belt comet with a Jupiter Tisserand's parameter of 2.99. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 3.4\u20135.1 AU once every 8 years and 9 months (3,199 days; semi-major axis of 4.25 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 6\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first precovery observation by the NEAT program in December 2001, more than a year prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa. == Physical characteristics == Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures approximately 4.4 kilometers in diameter using an absolute magnitude of 15.3 and an estimated albedo 0.07, typical for rather dark cometary-like bodies. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, shape and spin axis remain unknown. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 6 April 2012. As of 2018, it has not been named. == References == == External links == * 282P/(323137) 2003 BM80 (2021), MISAO project, Seiichi Yoshida * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (320001)-(325000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 323137 323137 20030131 ",
