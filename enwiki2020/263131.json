    "text": "Blackwardine, Herefordshire, England is at , and in the parish of Ford and Stoke Prior. It is the site of a Romano-British settlement known as Black Caer Dun. A golden bracelet and ring have been found there as well as many human remains. An 1885 account notes \"broken pieces of pottery were thickly scattered about and in one part of the railway cutting near the surface some 40 or of charred material 18 inches thick were observed\". It is where Alfred Watkins first developed his theory of Ley lines on 30 June 1921. The place was excavated the same year. ==References== == External links == *Photos of Blackwardine and surrounding area on geograph Category:History of Herefordshire Category:Villages in Herefordshire Category:Ley lines ",
