    "text": "Kathy's So-Called Reality is a television clip show that aired in 2001, hosted by comedian and former Suddenly Susan star Kathy Griffin. The show was \"part monologue, part round-table\", featuring Griffin discussing clips from a variety of reality television shows the week prior with a panel of family and friends. According to Griffin, the reality shows, even the \"scandal-plagued\" Temptation Island, \"amazingly\" contributed clips to be mocked. The show premiered on February 4, 2001 on MTV, and ended on April 1, 2001 after airing only six episodes; the network did not renew the show due to low ratings. USA Today columnist Whitney Matheson wrote that the show \"seemed to be struggling for content,\" and \"all the good jokes are taken by the time Kathy's weekly rant sees airtime.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Kathy's So-Called Reality at TV.com Category:MTV original programming Category:2001 American television series endings Category:2001 American television series debuts Category:2000s American reality television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Kathy Griffin ",
