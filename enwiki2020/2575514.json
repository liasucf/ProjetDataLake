A petition was submitted in 1859 with 144 signatures of local residents from Darling Point, Paddington and Watsons Bay for the formation of the Municipality. With no petition against formation of the Municipality, Woollahra was proclaimed to be named so on 17 April 1860, and gazetted on 20 April 1860. At the first meeting, The Hon. George Thornton was elected as the first Chairman of Woollahra. In 1947, after previously acquiring 'Iron House' on Ocean Street, in the 1860s, Council transferred to the current site at Redleaf. Woollahra largely developed as a residential locality. A few small local industries were established in Woollahra, Double Bay and Paddington; but with the residential gentrification of Paddington and Woollahra in the 1960s, most of these cottage industries had vanished by the end of the 20th century. Woollahra's cultural heritage has been enriched by the influx of people from many different cultural backgrounds. Some of the influential immigrants to Woollahra have been the Chinese market gardeners, who began leasing land in Double Bay gully and Rose Bay in the 1880s; the Portuguese whalers who settled at Watsons Bay in the 19th century, building a church and becoming a part of the village life, and the many Europeans who migrated after World War II and helped change the face of commercial centres such as Double Bay. A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that the Municipality of Woollahra merge with the Waverley and Randwick councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately . Following an independent review, in May 2016 the NSW Government sought to dismiss the Council and force its amalgamation with Waverley and Randwick councils. Woollahra Council instigated legal action claiming that there was procedural unfairness and that a KPMG report at the centre of merger proposals had been \"misleading\". The matter was heard before the NSW Court of Appeal who, in December 2016, unanimously dismissed the council's appeal, finding no merit in its arguments that the proposed merger with its neighbouring councils was invalid. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Woollahra, Waverley and Randwick local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. == Heritage listings == The Municipality of Woollahra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Bellevue Hill, 24 Victoria Road: Leura * Darling Point, 1a Carthona Avenue: Lindesay * Darling Point, 68 Darling Point Road: The Swifts * Darling Point, 103 Darling Point Road: Babworth House * Darling Point, 11-21 Greenoaks Avenue: Bishopscourt * Double Bay, Cross Street: Double Bay Compressed Air Ejector Station * Double Bay, 11 Gladswood Gardens: Gladswood House * Double Bay, 337-347 New South Head Road: Overthorpe * Double Bay, 560 New South Head Road: Fairwater * Double Bay, 4 and 6 Wiston Gardens: Houses * Edgecliff, 8 Albert Street: Fenton and surrounds * Paddington, 1 Ormond Street: Juniper Hall, Paddington * Paddington, 56a Ormond Street: Engehurst * Paddington, 246 Oxford Street: Paddington Post Office * Paddington, 1 Young Street: Paddington Substation * Point Piper, 10 Dunara Gardens: Dunara * Rose Bay, 3-4 Fernleigh Gardens: Site of Ficus superba var. henneana tree * Rose Bay, 1-7 Salisbury Road: Salisbury Court (Rose Bay) * Vaucluse, 32b Fitzwilliam Road: Wentworth Memorial Church * Vaucluse, Chapel Road: Wentworth Mausoleum * Vaucluse, Greycliffe Avenue: Nielsen Park * Vaucluse, Old South Head Road: Macquarie Lighthouse * Vaucluse, 52 Vaucluse Road: Strickland House, Vaucluse * Vaucluse, 69a Wentworth Road: Vaucluse House * Watsons Bay, Dunbar (ship) * Watsons Bay, Old South Head Road: Hornby Lighthouse * Woollahra, 14 Rosemont Avenue: Rosemont * Woollahra, Waimea Avenue: Waimea House ==See also== * Local government areas of New South Wales ==References== == External links == * Woollahra Municipal Council website * Woollahra Community Profile, including 2011 Census information Woollahra Category:1860 establishments in Australia ",
