    "text": "The Toyota Matrix, officially referred to as the Toyota Corolla Matrix, is a compact hatchback manufactured by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada and derived from the Toyota Corolla. Introduced in 2002 as a 2003 model, the Matrix is the result of a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors, with the GM version being the Pontiac Vibe, which was assembled by New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) in Fremont, California, United States. Officially sold in North America until being discontinued, the Matrix was positioned as a sporty hatchback counterpart of the North American Corolla and was counted as a variant of it in Toyota's sales figures. Although identical mechanically, and nearly as much internally, the Matrix and Vibe had different sheetmetal and exterior trim designed by their respective brands. Both vehicles are narrow, tall station wagons styled in a quasi-SUV fashion (called a crossover utility vehicle or \"CUV\" by Toyota) and marketed to a fairly youthful market segment. This type of car is also commonly referred to as a sport wagon. First sold in February 2002, the Matrix saw a minor facelift for the 2005 model year, and was redesigned completely in 2008 for the 2009 model year, following the tenth generation Corolla. Sales of the Matrix were discontinued in the United States in 2013 and in Canada in 2014. ==First generation (E130; 2003)== Rear view The Matrix was first introduced in the 2003 model year and based on the Toyota Corolla platform. Relatively unchanged in 2004, a facelift for 2005 brought minor revisions to the exterior \u2013 mainly revised styling to the front fascia due to complaints of rubbing the ground on the previous incarnation and replacing the red lenses on the taillamps with clear ones. Also, the center instrument panel was slightly redesigned and featured a Toyota head unit in place of the previous GM-sourced radio. Two 1.8 L four-cylinder engines were offered in the Matrix: the 1ZZ-FE used in the Corolla, which originally made in 2003 through 2005 models, but was reduced to in 2006, and the performance-oriented 2ZZ-GE taken from the Toyota Celica GT-S, which produced (previously in 2003, in 2004, and in 2005). The 2006 drop in power was due to new testing standards, and not a change in the engine's actual performance. In late 2006, Toyota discontinued use of the 2ZZ-GE engine and dropped the XRS from the Matrix lineup to be temporarily replaced by the M-Theory edition. Like each year of the XRS model, the M-Theory was a limited production run of 2500 cars. All wheel drive was also available from 2003\u20132006 when coupled to the 1ZZ engine and automatic transmission, but was dropped at the same time as the XRS. ===Models=== ====Standard (2003\u20132008)==== 2005\u20132008 Toyota Matrix Standard Starting out at in 2003, the no-frills base model came with few options. While it did have standard air conditioning, it left out features like color-keyed mirrors and door handles, blacked out window frames and power mirrors. One option the base model could be had with was AWD for an additional $1,465 (although the actual increase was $2,445, since AWD only came with an automatic transmission). Adding AWD brought the car's curb weight of up to and decreased power by and . In 2004, the price of a base model remained unchanged, but by the last year of production, 2008, it had risen to $15,510. ====XR (2003\u20132008)==== 2003\u20132004 Toyota Matrix XR The Matrix's XR mid-grade trim level added features like color-matched mirrors and door handles, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a panic button on the key fob. Options available with the XR trim included a sunroof, body kit, and alloy wheels. A 2003 XR started at and , but when equipped with AWD cost at least $18,445 (only $305 less than an XRS) and weighed in at . Like the base model, the XR's AWD engine was detuned. Again, the car's price for its sophomore year stayed the same, but in the four years after that, it rose to $16,990. ====XRS (2003\u20132006)==== TRD grille For , the top-of-the-line model came standard with four-wheel disc brakes and six speakers. Also included on all XRS models were anti-lock brakes with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution, 16-inch alloy wheels, and cruise control. In 2003, 17-inch wheels could be had, but only on cars without a sunroof. An option combining wheels and a sunroof became available the second year of production. In 2005, an XRS started out at $18,850, and for its last year, it sold for at least $19,250. The XRS trim included an engine upgrade to Toyota's higher-performance 2ZZ-GE engine. Displacing , or 109.6 cubic inches, it produced and \u2013 a then-rare 100 horsepower-per-liter. While its 11.5:1 compression ratio was a large factor in its performance, the engine could change to a second cam profile at higher RPM through Toyota's VVTL-i and was designed for operation up to 8500 RPM. The engine's high compression necessitates \"premium\" gasoline (91 octane or above in the (R+M)/2 scale). With the exception of an available automatic in 2003, a six-speed manual transmission was the only gearbox offered in the XRS. A Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TLEV) its first year of production, the 2ZZ was retrofitted in 2004 with a smog pump and reclassified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV). The Matrix was able to come to a full stop from in only . Due to being front wheel drive, the XRS has a weight distribution of 59/41 (front/rear), which may result in understeer when driven hard. It weighs in at a relatively light . ====M-Theory (2007)==== Not a trim level, the M-Theory edition was a 2007-only appearance package with an exclusive \"Speedway Blue\" color. For , a customer got 17-inch Caldina wheels, a chrome exhaust tip, a numbered plaque (1 of 2500), four wheel disc brakes, and a spoiler. To improve handling, a \"sport tuned suspension\" and strut tower brace were included. ===Interior=== thumb Interior with seats folded. One of the Matrix's unique design features is its interior, particularly the rear 60/40 seats and cargo area. Made with rigid plastic backs, the rear seats fold flat, creating a cargo area. In a practicality test, Motor Trend was able to haul more cargo in the Matrix than in a Subaru WRX wagon with of space. In addition to the eight tie-downs in the back for attaching the included cargo nets and tonneau cover, the seats and rear floor have integrated rails for installing extra tie-downs. Up front, the passenger seat also folds flat, accommodating long items like surf boards or allowing drivers to use the tray in its back to hold items like a laptop computer. An electronic device can be charged with the 115 volt/100 watt power inverter (US models only). The first year of production (2003), the instrument cluster was completely red. However, the next year, Toyota made the numbers white while keeping the rest of the gauges red. When the car was updated in 2005, a digital clock was added to the radio bezel. ===Crash testing=== NHTSA crash test ratings (2003): *Frontal Crash Test \u2013 Driver: *Frontal Crash Test \u2013 Passenger: *Side Impact Rating \u2013 *Side Impact Rating \u2013 Rear: *Rollover Rating: ''' ===Recalls=== In May 2008, Toyota issued a recall for 2003 and 2004 model year Corollas and Matrixes.

The recall notices states that an improperly manufactured Engine Control Module (ECM) can develop a crack in its circuitry, potentially causing the \"Check Engine\" light to illuminate, harsh shifting, and stalling and/or failure of the engine to start. On November 20, 2019, along with 2003-2008 Corollas and 2004 and 2005 Yarises, the Matrix of the model years from 2003 to 2008 was recalled in Mexico due to these cars containing Takata frontal passenger airbags which might degrade due to weather exposure and variation of high temperatures, which usually occurs on cities with extreme weather, which might cause serious injuries on passengers. Toyota has advised all owners of the following cars to replace these faulty frontal passenger airbags or all airbags, depending of which version is. Toyota of Mexico has notified PROFECO that in the Mexican market exists 618 vehicles in addition to these three recalled vehicles. The replacing campaign will go due November 22.https://automexico.com/industria/toyota-corolla-toyota-yaris-y-toyota- matrix-deben-ir-a-revision-aid5937 ==Second generation (E140; 2009)== Initially rumored by Toyota and auto news media as a Matrix replacement named the Blade, the second generation Matrix was unveiled on October 31, 2007, at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show in Las Vegas, and was first available at dealerships in February 2008, as a 2009 model. The Matrix' Pontiac Vibe sibling was also upgraded, but production of that model ended after 2009 when the entire Pontiac brand was retired. In the United States, three trim levels (Standard [base], S and XRS) are offered, as well as two inline-four engines: a 2ZR-FE for the base model (chassis code ZRE142) and a 2AZ-FE for the S and XRS trims. The former is offered with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the larger engine is equipped with either a manual or automatic five-speed transmission. In addition, the S trim can be equipped with a four-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. Canadian buyers are offered in four trim levels: a 1.8 L-powered base model and the XR, AWD and XRS models with a 2.4-liter engine. This generation marks it the first time it is sold in Mexico. The Matrix comes only in two trim levels to Mexico: Base and XR. For the 2011 model year, the Matrix received redesigned exterior and interior elements, including front and rear fascias, wheels and seat fabrics. The radio was also change to allow for Bluetooth capability. ===Models=== In 2008, Toyota began offering different trim levels in the United States and Canada. The XR trim became exclusive for Canada, and the S trim was released only in the U.S., while AWD remained available in both markets after 2009. All vehicles have an independent front suspension with MacPherson struts, but only XRS trim and cars equipped with all-wheel drive and 158 horsepower, feature an independent rear suspension using double wishbones instead of a semi-independent torsion beam. The 2009 models have less interior space than the preceding years, with a total of compared to the original . The XRS trim was dropped from the U.S. lineup for the 2011 model year. ===Safety=== All models come standard with side torso airbags, side curtain airbags, anti-lock braking and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard. Toyota's Smart Stop Technology was added to the Matrix for the 2011 model year. The Matrix is rated \"Good\" in both frontal and side Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests.

The recall notices states that improperly lubricated driver's side power window master switch may develop a \u201cnotchy\u201d or sticky feel, and that improper aftermarket lubrication may present a fire hazard. The repair involves lubricating the switch assembly with a special fluorine grease. ===Discontinuation=== On August 5, 2013, Toyota announced that it would end production of the Matrix for the US market after the 2013 model year due to declining sales, and that there were no plans to replace it with another vehicle. The Canadian market continued for the 2014 model year, with those assembled in Cambridge, Ontario by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. The Matrix was then discontinued in Canada and was not offered for the 2015 model year. Toyota continued to sell a range of compact hatchbacks in North America through its Scion brand. On September 1, 2016, \"the Scion brand transitioned to Toyota.\" For the 2017 model year, the Corolla iM would be the successor of the Matrix.
