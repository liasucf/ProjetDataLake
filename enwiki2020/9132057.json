    "text": "The Threepenny Review is an American literary magazine founded in 1980. It is published in Berkeley, California, by founding editor Wendy Lesser. Maintaining a quarterly schedule (March, June, September, December), it offers fiction, memoirs, poetry, essays and criticism to a readership of 10,000. Without the support of patrons or a university, the publication has an annual budget of $200,000.Lee, Felicia. \"A Little Journal for Nearly Every Literary Voice,\" The New York Times, December 27, 2004. ==History== San Francisco's Fraenkel Gallery was the source for this 1939 Frank Navara photo, Coffee Pot, Ohio, featured on the cover of The Threepenny Review 83 (Fall 2000). The magazine was launched in 1980 after Lesser (then 27 years old with no editing experience) was a guest editor of Ron Nowicki's San Francisco Review of Books. She found the experience so rewarding that she decided to create her own publication, and the first issue of The Threepenny Review appeared three months later.Guthmann, Edward. \"Threepenny Review marks 25 years of doggedly panning for literary gold,\" San Francisco Chronicle, January 7, 2005. She chose the title for its \"obvious Brechtian overtones.\"Bolick, Katie. \"Truth Enters In\" The Atlantic: Atlantic Unbound, March 17, 1999. It sometimes features an essay symposium, as described by critic Deborah Mead in reviewing issue 104 (Winter 2006): > What sets The Threepenny Review apart from other little magazines is its > cultural essays. A frequent feature of this journal is the symposium, a > series of essays on a single topic. The essayists in this issue focus on > plot, many writing to defend plot from its current disfavor, although Geoff > Dyer chimes in to denigrate plot some more. Other essays tackle unexpected > topics\u2014music and pain, Dylan\u2019s worst song, the placebo effect\u2014with insight > and lucidity.Mead, Deborah.
