    "text": "StepTalk is the official GNUstep scripting language framework that represents separate scriptable servers or applications as a single object environment. It is meant to be independent of the programming language used. Its default language is Smalltalk running on an Objective-C runtime. StepTalk was ported to Mac OS X. == Introduction == The goal of StepTalk is to provide an environment for gluing applications together and to provide a framework for communication between users and objects in the applications. Other major goals are: * Simple and quick extensions of applications or tools * Batch-processing of objects in applications or tools * Fast prototyping of applications or new application features; play and tune a concept in a reactive interpreted environment The default scripting language in StepTalk is Smalltalk. This is because Smalltalk is a very simple language and is easy to learn. There are just a few basic principles that a user must know to be able to use the language, and it is similar to a natural language. Smalltalk uses a similar approach to that of Objective-C, the language used in GNUstep. == Platforms == StepTalk works on any platform on which GNUstep works. Ports to native macOS Cocoa framework are being developed by various contributors. == See also == * AppleScript * Object-oriented programming ==External links== * Category:Scripting languages Category:Smalltalk programming language family Category:Dynamically typed programming languages Category:GNUstep ",
