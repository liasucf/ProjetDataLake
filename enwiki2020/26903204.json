    "text": "\"The Best Thing\" is a song by Australian pop group Savage Garden, released as the seventh and final single from their second studio album Affirmation on March 19, 2001. This was also their final single released before their breakup later that year. ==Background== \"The Best Thing\" was released as a single on 19 March 2001, exclusively in the United Kingdom and Europe. It was the last single released by the group before their split in October 2001. The single's cover art was also used for the album's fifth Australian single, \"Chained to You\". No official music video was made. The song's lyrics describe the contrasting feelings of being irresistibly attracted to a person while being too frightened to admit that attraction. The \"best thing\" represents the strongly positive perceptions a person may have of the one they feel attracted to. The group's performance from the Superstars and Cannonballs DVD was made into a music video, which eventually aired on MTV. This song was one of Savage Garden's few singles that did not make the cut for their greatest hits compilation Truly Madly Completely: The Best of Savage Garden. \"The Best Thing\" was best known for being the first song to kick off the concerts promoting their second album. The song charted in the United Kingdom at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Track listing== ===United Kingdom=== CD single # \"The Best Thing\" \u2013 4:19 # \"Chained to You\" \u2013 4:08 # \"Hold Me\" (live in Brisbane, May 2000) \u2013 4:52 Cassette # \"The Best Thing\" \u2013 4:19 # \"Hold Me\" (live in Brisbane, May 2000) \u2013 4:52 ===Europe=== Single CD # \"The Best Thing\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:41 # \"Affirmation\" (live) \u2013 5:48 Maxi-CD # \"The Best Thing\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:41 # \"Affirmation\" (live) \u2013 5:48 # \"I Want You\" (live) \u2013 3:50 # \"I Knew I Loved You\" (live) \u2013 8:15 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|35 |} ==References== Category:1999 songs Category:2001 singles Category:Savage Garden songs Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Walter Afanasieff Category:Songs written by Daniel Jones (musician) Category:Songs written by Darren Hayes ",
