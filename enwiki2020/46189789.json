    "text": "Anthony Felix Gemignani (born August 23, 1973) is a 13-time World Pizza Champion, master instructor at the International School of Pizza, two-time Food Network gold medalist, restaurateur of 21 concepts, author and reality television personality. Gemignani is the president of the World Pizza Champions, a multiple Guinness World Record holder, and is the owner and executive chef of several restaurants. ==Early life and career== Gemignani was born in Fremont, California to Frank and Eileen Gemignani. He grew up on his family's apricot farm with his grandfather, parents and older brother, and is a third generation Italian American. Gemignani graduated from Washington High School in Fremont, after which he began working at his brother Frank Jr.'s restaurant, Pyzano's, in Castro Valley, California, in 1991. Gemignani began his pizza acrobatic career while at Pyzano's as a way to entertain customers and to show the quality of the dough to diners. He competed all over the world, winning 8 world champion titles for pizza acrobatics between 1995\u20132007, and earning himself the nickname of the \"Michael Jordan of Pizza Throwing\". Gemignani traveled the world for 16 years, competing, working in others' kitchens, and learning about regional styles which allowed him to learn each style of pizza and perfect it. In 2000, while on his honeymoon in Sorrento, Italy, he and his wife Julie dined at Trianon da Cir in Naples, which motivated him into a lifelong quest to keep learning and striving to become a better pizzaiolo. He paid careful attention to the authentic craft of each style of pizza, respecting its history, while aiming to make it better. This attitude birthed his motto \"Respect the Craft\" which can be seen on his websites, books, and even tattooed on his hands. Gemignani formed the World Pizza Champions in 2005, which is made up of over 60 team members who have each earned the highest awards in the pizza industry, along with television appearances, Guinness World Records, and respect as leading professionals and pioneers in the pizza industry. In 2007, Gemignani took the title of \"World Champion Pizza Maker\" at the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy. Gemignani was the first American and non-Neapolitan to ever take this title. Gemignani is the first and only Triple Crown winner for baking at the International Pizza Championships in Lecce, Italy, meaning, he won three first place titles in one competition. ==Restaurants== ===Tony's Pizza Napoletana=== Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco, CA.

Gemignani's Chicago-style pizza and whiskey bar, Capo's, opened in November 2012 just two blocks away from Tony's Pizza Napoletana; it was designed to feel like a prohibition era speakeasy. The restaurant invites family style dining, serving four styles of Chicago-style pizza: Deep Dish, Stuffed, Cast Iron Pan, and Cracker Thin; along with Southern Italian dishes.
