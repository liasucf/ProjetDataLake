    "text": "Rhizopogon amylopogon is a sub-genus of Rhizopogon containing seven species. * R. brunsii * R. arctostaphyli * R. kretzerae * R. salebrosus * R. pinyonensis * R. ellenae * R. subpurpurascens Sub-genus Amylopogon are ectomycorrhizal fungi categorized as monotropoid mycorrhiza.Smith SE, Read DJ (1997) Mycorrhizal symbiosis, 2nd edn. Academic Press, London These fungi are characterized by the presence of a mantle, hartig net, unique fungal peg, and intracellular hyphal complexes. They are also classified by a specific and obligate symbiosis with members of Monotropoideae through a process known as myco-heterotrophyTHOMAS D. BRUNS and DAVID J. READ (2000) In vitro germination of nonphotosynthetic,myco-heterotrophic plants stimulated by fungi isolated from the adult plants, New Phytology, 148, 335 - 342Bidartendo MI, Bruns TD (2002) Fine-level mycorrhizal specificity in the Monotropoideae (Ericaceae): specificity for fungal species groups. Mol Ecol 11:557\u2013569 . Monotropoideae species depend on Amylopogon fungi for carbon which they in turn acquire from members of Pinus in a host specific tripartite hartig net exchange. ==References== Category:Rhizopogonaceae ",
