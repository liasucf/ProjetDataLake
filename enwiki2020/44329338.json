    "text": "alt=Shakib Al Hasan In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five\u2013for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of August 2017 only 45 players have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Shakib Al Hasan, a slow left-arm orthodox spinner, represents the Bangladesh national cricket team. With 21 five-wicket hauls across all formats of international cricket, he ranks equal twenty-fourth in the all-time list, and first among his countrymen. He has been described as \"Bangladesh's greatest-ever cricketer\", and is ranked as the top all-rounder in One Day International (ODI) cricket as of October 2016. Shakib's first five-wicket haul came against New Zealand during the first Test of the 2008\u201309 home series; he took seven wickets for 36 runs in New Zealand's first innings. As of August 2017, it remains his best bowling figures in Test cricket. He ended the year with three more five-wicket hauls, which came in consecutive innings against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In Test cricket, he is among the four bowlers who have taken five-wicket hauls against all Test-playing nations. Shakib made his ODI debut in 2007, a year before his first Test appearance. He has taken two five-wicket hauls in the format. His best figures in the format are five wickets for 29 runs against Afghanistan in the 2019 World Cup. In December 2018, Shakib became the eighth cricketer to take at least one five wicket-haul in all three formats when he took five wickets for 20 runs in the second Twenty20 International against West Indies. ==Key== Shakib has taken nine of his twenty five-wicket hauls at the alt=Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left margin-left: 10px;\" |+Key |- !
