In the 2009 issue of the guidebook, Tohko Amano was voted the No. 1 ranked female light novel character. In Kadokawa Shoten's Light Novel Award contest held in 2007, Book Girl and the Suicidal Mime won an award in the mystery category. In a review of the first light novel Book Girl and the Suicidal Mime by Anime News Network contributor Carlo Santos, the author Mizuki Nomura is cited as being \"too ambitious\" for her use of several differing genres of storytelling, such as the use of mystery, character-driven comedy, and 20th-century Japanese literature. Santos notes how these subjects, while present, are not expounded upon, and several plot points are pointed out as being left open (because there are more novels). The murder-mystery portion is described as being \"awkwardly written\", which reads more like \"plot summary than actual dialogue.\" The reviewer makes comparisons with the Haruhi Suzumiya light novel series in how Kyon and Haruhi Suzumiya are similar to the main characters Konoha Inoue and Tohko Amano from the Book Girl series. Santos further notes how the character-driven comedy is similar in style to that used in the Haruhi Suzumiya series. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Book Girl at Yen Press *Book Girl at Square Enix *Book Girl at Kadokawa Shoten * Category:2006 Japanese novels Category:2008 manga Category:2009 anime television series Category:2010 manga Category:2011 manga Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Famitsu Bunko Category:Gangan Comics manga Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Light novels Category:Novels set in schools Category:Production I.G Category:Sh\u014dnen manga Category:Sh\u014djo manga Category:Square Enix franchises Category:Yen Press titles ",
