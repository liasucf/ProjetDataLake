A recipient of the Israel Prize, he taught and served as director of the Rubin Academy of Music, now known as the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music in Tel Aviv.http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/music/Eindex.html \u00d6d\u00f6n P\u00e1rtos == Biography == Partos was born in Budapest (at that time, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, together with Antal Dor\u00e1ti and M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber, studied the violin with Jen\u0151 Hubay and composition with Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly. Upon completing his studies, he was accepted to the position of Principal Violinist in an orchestra in Lucerne, after which he played in other European orchestras, among them, in Berlin. In 1934, following Hitler\u2019s ascendance to power, Partos returned to his birthplace, Budapest, where he was Principal Violinist in the city\u2019s symphony orchestra. In 1936, Bronis\u0142aw Huberman founded the Palestine Orchestra (now: Israel Philharmonic Orchestra), for which he recruited Jewish musicians cast out of Europe's orchestras. Huberman sought to include Partos, though the latter's take-up of the post was delayed due to a prior commitment \u2013 a contract with the government of the USSR through which Partos taught violin and composition in the Conservatory of Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1937, Partos left the USSR, after having refused to join the Communist Party during the period of the Moscow Trials. He returned to Budapest, where he served as the orchestra\u2019s Principal Violinist along with making concert tours of European countries. At that time, Bronis\u0142aw Huberman invited Partos to a meeting in Florence, where he offered him the position of Principal Violist in the Palestine Orchestra. Declining attractive offers from South America (notably, Peru), Partos immigrated to British Mandatory Palestine in 1938. Between the years 1938\u20131956, Partos was the principal of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's viola section, as well as playing numerous solo performances in Israel and abroad. In 1946, together with cellist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Vincze, he founded the Samuel Rubin Israel Academy of Music (now: Buchmann-Mehta School of Music) in Tel Aviv, and in 1959 was instrumental in founding the Thelma Yellin High School of Art in Tel Aviv. In 1951, Partos was appointed director of the Rubin Academy, a position he was to hold until his death (although the state of his health during his last five years of life prevented him from taking an active part in the Academy's administration, a position filled by Prof. Arie Vardi who succeeded him as director there). \u00d6d\u00f6n Partos is regarded as among the most important Israeli composers.
