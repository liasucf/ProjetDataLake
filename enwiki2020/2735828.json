    "text": "Marmolada (German: Marmolata, Ladin: Marmoleda) is a mountain in northeastern Italy and the highest mountain of the Dolomites (a section of the Alps). It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto. ==Geography== The mountain is located about north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada). The ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia , Punta Rocca , Punta Ombretta , Monte Serauta , and Pizzo Serauta . An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley. ==History== Paul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel. Until the end of World War I the border between Austria- Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices. It was also the site of fierce mine warfare on the Italian Front. As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered. == Gallery == File:Marmolada_Sunset.jpg|Sunset File:Marmolada_Massif.JPG File:Canazei.jpg|Marmolada from Canazei File:Marmolada, Italy.jpg| File:Marmolada 3342 m Punta Rocca View from the West - panoramio.jpg|Punta Rocca, 3342 m File:Marmolada dal Col Margherita.jpg ==See also== * White Friday (1916) * White War * List of Italian regions by highest point == References == == External links == * Computer generated summit panoramas North South Index * Marmolada on Hike.uno Category:Mountains of Trentino Category:Mountains of Veneto Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Glaciers of the Alps Category:Alpine three-thousanders Category:Dolomites Category:Highest points of Italian regions ",
