    "text": "Driver '76 is a video game for the PlayStation Portable, which was released on 8 May 2007 in the US, and on 11 May 2007 in the EU. The game is a prequel to Driver: Parallel Lines, and is set two years prior. It is the first and only game in the Driver series for the PSP. It was developed by Ubisoft Reflections and Sumo Digital, and published by Ubisoft. ==Plot== In New York City 1976, the story starts with Ray, a wheelman. He falls in love with Chen Chi, but she's already got someone, Jimmy. After gaining respect from her father, Ray is betrayed and has to earn money in the meantime. He eventually meets back with Zhou, Chen Chi's father, he tells him of how Jimmy is a traitor and for the remainder of the game you must take down Jimmy's empire. After Jimmy is presumably killed in an explosion, Zhou gives Ray his blessing to go out with Chen Chi, but finds out that she has been kidnapped by a scarred Jimmy, however Ray manages to save Chen Chi and shoot down Jimmy's helicopter with a car. ==Gameplay== Mission structure is similar to Driver: Parallel Lines, where driving is an important aspect in gameplay, shooting still remains in the game. Most missions are driving based while some are shootouts or when Ray sits in the back of a car and shoots incoming enemies. One difference that sets Driver '76 from the rest of the Driver series is that it uses comic- styled illustrations rather than cinematic cutscenes, making the game behave more like a comic book. There are 26 main missions, grouped into 6 chapters. The missions get harder as the player progresses through the chapters. Money, cars and weapons are rewarded if missions are successfully completed. ==Setting== The simulation of New York City is similar to the previous installment, but since it is set two years before as a prequel, there are some differences. Mostly it is all the same, with a few differences in cars, buildings, landscape, and map. ==Reception== Driver '76 received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. ==References== ==External links== * Driver official website * Ubisoft's Driver 76 page * Category:2007 video games Category:Driver (video game series) Category:Open world video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Portable-only games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 1976 Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Sumo Digital games ",
