In the 2016 census, Bloomsbury had a population of 598 people. == Geography == The Bruce Highway traverses the locality from south to north, passing through the town which is approximately in the centre of the locality. The North Coast railway also traverses the locality from south to north, running mostly parallel and immediately west of the highway, with the town serviced by the Bloomsbury railway station. The locality is a mixture of low- lying farming land, mostly used for sugarcane. There is a cane tramway through the locality to transport the harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills. Other parts of the locality are mountainous and undeveloped. == History == Bloomsbury State School opened on 16 May 1927. A postal receiving office opened at Bloomsbury around 1896, became a post office in March 1909, and closed around 1916. A second receiving office opened around 1925, became a post office in March 1926 and closed around 1993. == Amenities == Bloomsbury State School is a primary (P-6) school for boys and girls operated by the Queensland Government at 8545 Bruce Highway.
