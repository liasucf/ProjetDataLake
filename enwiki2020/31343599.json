He was baptised on 6 December 1614.John Burke, John Bernard Burke A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies Wyvill is credited with a rare little octavo in the Bodleian Library entitled Certaine serious Thoughts which at severall times & upon sundry occasions have stollen themselves into verse and now into the publike view from the author [monogram, \u2018C. W.\u2019], Esquire. Together with a chronological table denoting the names of such Princes as ruled the neighbour states & were contemporary with our English Kings published in London in 1647. This volume of verse is described at some length in Brydges's Censura Literaria (1808, vii. 261\u20134), and there dubiously attributed to C. Warwick. The Wyvill arms on the title-page point almost conclusively to (Sir) Christopher's authorship, which is conjecturally adopted in the British Museum Catalogue. Wyvill inherited the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1648. In 1659, Wyvill was elected Member of Parliament for Richmond in the Third Protectorate Parliament.History of Parliament Online - Wyvill, Sir Christopher, 3rd Bt.
