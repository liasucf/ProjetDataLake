She works on hybrid organic \u2013 inorganic materials, such as perovskites, for clean energy and large area lighting. == Early life and education == Karunadasa grew up in Colombo. She attended high school in Sri Lanka and was a student at Ladies' College, Colombo. She thought that she would become a doctor, and eventually decided to apply to university in America. She was an undergraduate student at Princeton University, where she majored in chemistry and materials science. She was awarded a Certificate in Materials Science for her undergraduate project in 2003. During her undergraduate degree, Karunadasa worked with Robert Cava on the geometric magnetic frustration of metal oxides. His excitement about research inspired her to continue her own academic career. Karunadasa joined the University of California, Berkeley for her doctoral studies, working in inorganic chemistry with Jeffrey R. Long. During her PhD research Karunadasa developed catalysts for water splitting as well as exploring heavy atom building blocks for magnetic molecules. The molybdenum-oxo metal complex created by Karunadasa is around seventy times cheaper than platinum, the most commonly used metal catalyst in water splitting. == Research and career == Karunadasa worked on electrocatalysts with Christopher Chang at the University of California, Berkeley. She was a postdoctoral fellow with Harry B. Gray at the California Institute of Technology, where she worked on catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation. She was appointed to the faculty at Stanford University in 2012. Her group creates hybrid perovskite materials that combine small organic molecules with inorganic solids. Three-dimensional lead iodide perovskites are being investigated for solar cells, but they can be both unstable and toxic. For example, their sensitivity to water makes them difficult materials to use in the fabrication of large-scale devices. Karunadasa is interested in ways to mitigate for these shortcomings, and any transient changes that may occur when these materials absorb light. In particular, Karunadasa has created two- dimensional perovskites, with thin inorganic sheets, that can be tuned to emit every colour of visible light. In these systems the organic small molecules are sandwiched between the sheets. In the case of thick inorganic sheets, the inorganic materials act as absorbers, and enhance the stability of the perovskite materials. The organo-metal-halide perovskites created by Karunadasa and her collaborator Michael McGehee can be processed in solution. She believes that through careful chemical design it is possible to determine the fate of photogenerated charge carriers. Karunadasa has investigated the lifetimes of acoustic phonons in lead iodide perovskites with Michael Toney and Aron Walsh. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 2003 Princeton University Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis in Inorganic Chemistry * 2006 Tyco Electronics Graduate Fellowship * 2011 BP Postdoctoral Fellowship * 2013 Thieme Chemistry Journal Award * 2014 International Conference on Coordination Chemistry ICCC41 Rising Star Award * 2014 National Science Foundation CAREER Award * 2015 Sloan Research Fellowship * 2015 Stanford University Terman Faculty Fellowship === Selected publications === Her publications include; * * * Her work was featured in the Journal of the American Chemical Society Young Investigators Issue in 2019. She serves on the editorial board of Inorganic Chemistry. == References == Category:American people of Sri Lankan descent Category:Sri Lankan women academics Category:Sri Lankan women scientists Category:People from Colombo Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Stanford University faculty Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
