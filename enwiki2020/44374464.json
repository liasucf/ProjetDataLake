    "text": "In mathematics, Kadison transitivity theorem is a result in the theory of C*-algebras that, in effect, asserts the equivalence of the notions of topological irreducibility and algebraic irreducibility of representations of C*-algebras. It implies that, for irreducible representations of C*-algebras, the only non-zero linear invariant subspace is the whole space. The theorem, proved by Richard Kadison, was surprising as a priori there is no reason to believe that all topologically irreducible representations are also algebraically irreducible. ==Statement== A family \\mathcal{F} of bounded operators on a Hilbert space \\mathcal{H} is said to act topologically irreducibly when \\\\{0\\\\} and \\mathcal{H} are the only closed stable subspaces under \\mathcal{F}. The family \\mathcal{F} is said to act algebraically irreducibly if \\\\{0\\\\} and \\mathcal{H} are the only linear manifolds in \\mathcal{H} stable under \\mathcal{F}. Theorem. Theorem 5.4.3; Kadison, R. V.; Ringrose, J. R., Fundamentals of the Theory of Operator Algebras, Vol. I : Elementary Theory, If the C*-algebra \\mathfrak{A} acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space \\mathcal{H}, \\\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\\\} is a set of vectors and \\\\{x_1, \\cdots, x_n \\\\} is a linearly independent set of vectors in \\mathcal{H}, there is an A in \\mathfrak{A} such that Ax_j = y_j. If Bx_j = y_j for some self-adjoint operator B, then A can be chosen to be self- adjoint. Corollary. If the C*-algebra \\mathfrak{A} acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space \\mathcal{H}, then it acts algebraically irreducibly. ==References== * . * Kadison, R. V.; Ringrose, J.
