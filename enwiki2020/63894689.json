It is the first complete Bible printed entirely in Greek (the Old Testament is the Septuagint) to be published. Manutius dreamed of a trilingual Bible but never saw it come to fruition. However, before his death Manutius had begun an edition of the Septuagint, also known as the Greek Old Testament translated from Hebrew, the first ever to be published; it appeared posthumously in 1518. This edition is the first complete Bible printed entirely in Greek (first edition of the whole Bible in Greek; the text contained in the Complutensian Polyglot, though dated 1514-17, was not published before 1520). The text of this edition is based on the Complutensian text for the Old Testament, and upon the first edition of the New Testament by Erasmus for the New Testament. It was edited by , the father-in-law of Aldus (Pt. I. edited by Andreas Asolanus, pt. II. by , and pt. III., the New Testament, also by Franciscus Asolanus). The full title of the Aldine Bible is: \u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1fbf \u1f10\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, \u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u1f74 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2.
