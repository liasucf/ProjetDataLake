    "text": "Ancient Dreams is the third album of Swedish doom metal band Candlemass, released in 1988 and reissued in 2001 by Powerline Records with a bonus CD. The cover art of the album is a painting made by Thomas Cole, second in his series, \"The Voyage of Life\", entitled \"Youth\". Ancient Dreams was the first Candlemass album to chart in the US, debuting at No. 174 on the Billboard 200 album chart. \"Epistle 81\" (M\u00e4rk hur v\u00e5r skugga), was written by Swedish poet/musician Carl Michael Bellman (1740 \u2013 1795). \"Incarnation of Evil\" is actually a reworked version of the old Nemesis track \"Black Messiah.\" The band is not happy with the album mix, and they place the blame on their (then) record label rush-producing the LP to coincide with a US tour. ==Track listing== *The track \"Black Sabbath Medley\" is a CD bonus track and is composed of parts of songs from Black Sabbath, namely: \"Symptom of the Universe\", \"Sweet Leaf\", \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", \"Into the Void\", \"Electric Funeral\", \"Supernaut\", \"Black Sabbath\". ==Personnel== Candlemass * Messiah Marcolin \u2013 vocals * Lars Johansson \u2013 lead guitar * Mats Bj\u00f6rkman \u2013 rhythm guitar * Leif Edling \u2013 bass * Jan Lindh \u2013 drums Production * Rex Gissl\u00e9n \u2013 mixing at Montezuma Studios, Stockholm * Peter Dahl \u2013 mastering at Polar Studios, Stockholm * Wendy Kramer \u2013 artwork, graphics * Micke Lind \u2013 remastering * Micke M\u00e5rtensson \u2013 artwork, layout * Ulf Magnusson \u2013 photography == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|1989 |align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|45 |- |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (US) |align=\"center\"|174 |} ==References== Category:Candlemass (band) albums Category:1988 albums Category:Active Records albums Category:Enigma Records albums Category:Metal Blade Records albums ",
