    "text": "Incest between twins or twincest is a subclass of sibling incest and includes both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. == Terminology == Sexual arousal from a twin sister or sister in general is referred to as sororilagnia or sorophilia, while a male analogous term is fratrilagnia,Downey, Dara. \"The Gothic and the Grotesque in the Novels of Carson McCullers.\" The Palgrave Handbook of the Southern Gothic. Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2016. 365-377. and a more general term is sibcest.https://www.bustle.com/articles/126743-11-times-pretty-little-liars- got-a-little-weird-because-we-can-never-forget-those-masks == In Asian culture == In traditional Balinese culture, it was common for a set of twins of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they'd had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between descent and affinity in Balinese society. Incest was commonplace in Southeast Asian creation myths which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child or children, but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part. == In European culture == Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in Richard Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre, and a feature in some Greek mythology, such as the story of Byblis and Kaunos. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese Ramayana, and some scholars have speculated an early Indo- European link. The theme also appears in English literature, such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in Delarivier Manley's The New Atlantis. In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that \"most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood\". His study drew on Edvard Westermarck's hypothesis that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a nuclear family.Westermarck, Edvard (1922). The History of Human Marriage, Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193. One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a House of Lords debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings. The story was widely publicised in the British press, although its truthfulness was called into question. Czech identical twins Michal and Radek \u010cuma (also known as Milo and Elijah Peters) are male pornographic actors who performed together in video performances for BelAmi in 2009 and 2010. They said that they consider themselves to be both brothers and romantic partners, and except for video performances with other actors, are sexually monogamous with each other. ==In modern literature== The fantasy fiction series A Song of Ice and Fire describes a secret relationship between Jaime and Cersei Lannister, who are fraternal twins. Within the setting of the books, various historical characters from House Targaryen were married to their siblings. == References == Category:Incest Category:Twin ",
