    "text": "The Dallara SF19 is an open-wheel single-seater sports car that d\u00e9buted in 2019 in the Super Formula Japanese championship. It replaced the Dallara SF14. == History == The single-seater was introduced in October 2017, on the Suzuka Circuit, and is the only one admitted to the Super Formula championship, the most important open-wheel racing car championship in Japan, starting from the 2019 season. The first shakedown of the car took place in June 2018, at the Autodromo Riccardo Paletti in Varano de' Melegari, with the Japanese driver Tomoki Nojiri at its head. The driver completed 71 laps and also achieved a track record of 57 seconds, two seconds faster than the previous limit set by a LMP1 car. The first two cars produced were then shipped to Japan, for tests on Fuji Speedway. Nojiri, tests in at home, completed 129 laps, in two days, even if only on the second day he was able to fit dry tires after the rain of the first day. The time obtained, 1'26\"173, is two seconds lower than the pole position of 2017, obtained from the SF14. During the tests carried out in August, Nojiri also tried a new display model, placed on the helmet visor. == Technical specifications == The car, compared to the SF14, is based on greater exploitation of the downforce generated by the bottom, shifting the balance from the wings to the ground effect, in order to increase the chances of overtaking. The appearance is more similar to that of the F1, with a fin on the hood, and of the more pronounced lateral bellies. The Halo is not foreseen in the original project, but Dallara has studied the possibility of its presence. The engine derives from the one used in the Super GT, and is a 2.000 cc, with fuel limiter and push to pass system. ==References== SF19 Category:Open wheel racing cars Category:Super Formula ",
