Their top placement was earned by Elizabeth Egel who finished 5th in women's 200 m individual medley SM11. == Disability classifications == Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Athletics== {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Result !Rank |- |Egert Joesaar |Men's discus throw F44 |align=center|46.61 |align=center|8 |- |Sirly Tiik |Women's shot put F20 |align=center|11.39 |align=center|8 |} ==Cycling== ===Road=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Time !Rank |- align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Mari-Liis Juul |align=left|Women's road race C5 |2:35:02 |15 |- align=center |align=left|Women's time trial C5 |32:11.31 |9 |} ==Swimming== ;Men {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heats !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |- align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Kardo Ploomipuu |align=left|50 m freestyle S10 |26.08 |14 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|100 m backstroke S10 |1:03.03 |9 |colspan=2|Did not advance |} ;Women {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heats !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Brenda Tilk |align=left|50 m freestyle S7 |38.01 |10 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|100 m freestyle S7 |1:23.85 |11 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|100 m backstroke S7 |1:38.99 |13 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Elizabeth Egel |align=left|50 m freestyle S11 |33.49 |10 |colspan=2|Did not advance |- align=center |align=left|100 m backstroke S11 |1:28.28 |10 |colspan=2|Did not advance |- align=center |align=left|200 m individual medley SM11 |2:56.64 |4 Q |2:55.62 |5 |} == See also == *Estonia at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Category:2016 in Estonian sport ",
