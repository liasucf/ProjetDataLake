    "text": "Elsy Wameyo (born c. 1999) is a Kenyan-born Australian singer-songwriter, mostly singing in the hip hop genre. Based in Adelaide, South Australia, Wameyo was awarded Young Kenyan of the Year in 2018, and won people's choice Best Hip Hop at the annual South Australian Music Awards in the same year. Wameyo was born in Kenya and migrated to Australia with her family in 2006, when she was seven years old. She has performed at Laneway and Groovin' the Moo festivals, and was a featured artist with Triple J Unearthed. She is signed with the independent record label created by her mentor, Gabriel Akon, aka DyspOra, Playback 808. After being nominated in the Best New Artist and Best World Music categories at the 2018 South Australian Music Awards, Waneyo won people's choice Best Hip Hop. Lady Leshurr, Masego and the Hilltop Hoods have shown interest in her music, and she has also played alongside Adrian Eagle and Printz Board. Her work is informed by her strong belief in God, and she sees her talent as a gift from God. Although she does not feel her African roots to be a huge influence on her music, the response to her music in Kenya was enthusiastic when Akon took samples to the country. Her first single, \"Intuition\" was released in early 2018. This was followed by \"Outcast\" (November 2019) and \"Pastor\" (February 2020), which will feature on an EP later in the year. \"Outcast\" tells a personal story, largely based on the experience of growing up as an African in Australia, and the effect that racism has had on her and her peers. Both singles received positive reviews. It also explores the concept of \"home\" for African Australians. She spent some time travelling over the northern winter in 2019\u20132020, in Europe, the US and Kenya, during which she had a break from songwriting. Her 2020 single, \"Pastor\" uses an upbeat rhythm to explore feelings of anger, as she explores identity and belonging from the point of view of her parents, migrating to Australia. She was studying full-time at university as of 2019, and also singing in her church. ==References== Category:Australian hip hop musicians Category:Australian women Category:Kenyan emigrants to Australia Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
