    "text": "The 1969\u201370 New Orleans Buccaneers season was the 3rd and final season of the Buccaneers in the ABA. The team was 22-12 by the beginning of 1970 in part due to two 6 game winning streaks. But an eight-game losing streak (from February 22-March 8) plummeted the team from 31-24 to 31-32, and the team remained around .500 from there on, winning their last two games of the season to finish at exactly .500. The Bucs were 10th in points scored, with 107.9 points per game, and 2nd in points allowed at 107.1 points per game. However, the team finished one game out of the final playoff spot to the Los Angeles Stars. The team did not have as much success with attendance, and plans were made to play home games throughout the state (even renaming themselves as the Louisiana Buccaneers), such as Shreveport, Lafayette, Monroe and Baton Rouge. But on August 21, 1970, P. L. Blake bought the team, moving it to Memphis, Tennessee ten days later to become the Memphis Pros. New Orleans would not have a pro basketball team until 1974 with the Jazz. ==Roster== * 14 Tom Bowens \u2013 Point forward * 10 Mike Butler \u2013 Shooting guard * 34 Lee Davis \u2013 Point forward * 11 Ronald Franz \u2013 Small forward * 25 Gerald Govan \u2013 Center * 15 Jimmy Jones \u2013 Point guard * 23 Steve Jones \u2013 Shooting guard * 32 Jackie Moreland \u2013 Small forward * 12 Ron Perry \u2013 Shooting guard * 21 Red Robbins \u2013 Point forward * 22 Jerry Rook \u2013 Forward * 24 Skeeter Swift \u2013 Shooting guard * 31 Jasper Wilson \u2013 Small forward ==Final standings== ===Western Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" width=\"470\" ! width=\"30%\"|Western Division ! width=\"5%\"|W ! width=\"5%\"|L ! width=\"5%\"|PCT ! width=\"7.5%\"|GB |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Denver Rockets * || 51 || 33 ||| .607 | - |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Dallas Chaparrals * || 45 || 39 || .536 || 6.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Washington Caps * || 44 || 40 || .524 || 7.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Los Angeles Stars * || 43 || 41 ||.512 || 8.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|New Orleans Buccaneers || 42 || 42 ||.500 || 9.0 |} ==Awards, records, and honors== 1968 ABA All-Star Game played on January 24, 1970 * Jimmy Jones * Steve Jones * Gerald Govan * Red Robbins (injured, did not play) ==References== * Buccaneers on Basketball Reference New Orleans Category:New Orleans Buccaneers New Orleans Buccaneers, 1969-70 New Orleans Buccaneers, 1969-70 ",
