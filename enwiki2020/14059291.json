    "text": "Land of the Midnight Fun is a 1939 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon supervised by Tex Avery (credited as \"Fred Avery\"). The short was released on September 23, 1939. ==Plot== A cruise to Nome, Alaska, starts with various cruise ship jokes: the ship pulls out of the harbor like a car, raising anchor also raises the front of the boat, the ship follows the coast by curving around it. On arrival, we see some local scenes: A penguin eats two fish, then is eaten by the third; the dogs of a dog sled stop (behind an iceberg) at a telephone pole; a timber wolf goes around shouting \"Timber!\" (even the wolf admits, \"Gee, this is silly!\"); two Eskimos rub noses: in preparation, the woman applies lipstick to her nose. Finally, an Eskimo nightclub (after all, the nights are six months long) features a rotoscoped ice skater. The ship leaves, and gets caught in the fog near New York City; when the fog clears, we see the ship is perched atop the World's Fair Trylon. ==Availability== *LaserDisc \u2013 The Golden Age of Looney Tunes, Volume 4, Side 7 *DVD \u2013 Allegheny Uprising (USA 1995 Turner print included as a bonus) ==Notes== *This was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to feature the 1939\u201340 red, white, and blue target rings with a sky cloud background circle (similar to the cloud background in the modern Warner Bros. Pictures logo) in the Merrie Melodies opening titles. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1939 animated films Category:1939 films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.
