    "text": "Sattanathapuram Venkataraman Shekhar (born 26 December 1950) better known as 'S. Ve. Shekhar' is a Tamil playwright and film actor. In 2006, he was elected as an MLA from All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate from Mylapore. He is the founder of Federation of Brahmin associations of South India (FEBAS). He is presently one of the spokesperson for the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). ==Personal life== Shekher was born in Iyer family to Sattanathapuram Venkataraman on 26 December 1950. He completed his diploma in Mechanical Engineering and post diploma in Air Conditioning and Refrigeration. Shekher is married to Uma (Grand daughter of G. Ramanathan) - Renowned Tamil film Music director during 50's. The couple have a daughter named Anuradha and a son named Ashwin who debuted in the Tamil movie Vegam. == Politics == In 2006, he made an entry into politics by contesting and winning the Legislative Assembly Elections as an All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate from Mylapore. He was expelled from AIADMK on 30 July 2009. He later joined the Indian National Congress. Shekher was also expelled from the party for working against the party's interests. He later joined the BJP. He later founded the Federation of Brahmin Associations of South India on 2009. === Accusations on journalists which led to protests === S Ve Shekher shared a post on Facebook in April 2018 which allegedly accused all women journalists in Tamil Nadu of sleeping around with the top bosses to get their jobs, when a female journalist complained against Banwarilal Purohit for patting her cheek at a press conference. The cyber-crime wing of the police filed a case under 'section 4' of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment on the basis of a complaint from the journalists association. A large number of journalists protested outside the BJP office, urging that the party to take action against Shekher. Later, a small number of journalists went to Shekhar's house and proceeded to protest, some were also arrested for throwing stones at his house. Various political leaders and journalists condemned his statements. In May 2018, the High Court of Madras denied him anticipatory bail. The police had, however, stayed away from detaining Shekher, and even after the high court had refused the bail. He has been spotted in different functions with police security. He was later granted bail in June 2018. === Speech on AIADMK's name === Shekher in August 2020 said that if AIADMK needs to survive in politics then the image of Anna must be removed from the party flag and the image of MGR should be kept instead. He told the AIADMK party to remove the name \"Anna\" from the party and keep it as \"Amma\" instead. The speech caused a huge stir among the AIADMK party members who condemned his statements. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Edappadi K. Palaniswami responded by saying that Shekher will speak anything he wants and he would hide away if any court cases comes up against him. === Provocative speech and disrespecting India's flag with religious association === Shekher on August 3, 2020 had given provocative statements including India's flag being given a religious association. This caused social condemnations with police complaint to be registered. In September 2020, he was forced to apologize to the court unconditionally to consider for the police to not arrest. ==Career== Shekher's stage career began in 1974 when he acted in his first stage play. He entered Kollywood as a still photographer for the film Mogham. Then, was spotted by director K. Balachander who provided him a role in the film Ninaithale Inikkum and later gave him a full-fledged role in his movie Varumayin Niram Sivappu. After performing movie roles in around 96 Tamil films, Shekher moved into television, appearing in Vanna Kolangal and Nam Kudumbam. Vannakolangal created a sensation as it was re-telecast eight times in Doordarshan. Shekhar was a member and later a team leader of the popular drama troupe Mylapore Boys, who performed over 50 plays and over 100 drama skits from 1978 to 1988. Shekhar later became the president and the chairman of the troupe (by then renamed Mylapore Nataka Arangam). Most of his later plays and television dramas include characters from his troupe and from his former plays. Shekhar and his Mylapore Boys provided stiff competition for another popular drama troupe in Madras, The Crazy Troupe, led by Crazy Mohan. They have also worked together, with Crazy Mohan writing three plays for Shekher's troupe, Crazy Thieves in Palavakkam, One More Exorcist and Oru Sondha Veedu Vaadagai Veedagiradhu, and the cult comedy Katha Nayagan (1988 film) starring Pandiarajan and Shekher. An expert in broadcast, sound effects and theatrics, he won the Best All India Programme Producer Award for four years in a row from RAPA (Radio & Television Advertisers & Producers Association). As a photographer, his colour transparencies have adorned the covers of popular Tamil magazines. Encouraged by the success of a Singapore drama tour in 1973, he formed his drama troupe, Natakhapriya, which has so far staged 24 plays, with over 6,200 shows. His troupe frequently tours the United States, Europe, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. Starting eight full-length plays at one go, from 7:47 A.M. to 1:49 A.M. of the following day, Shekher performed a record of sorts in April 1985. While this is acknowledged an unsurpassed feat of a stage artist in the Limca Book of Records, Shekher credits this to his audience and fellow artists. The Mylapore Academy adjudged him \"The Best Comedian\" for three years in a row. Wisdom Magazine chose him as the 1990s Best Comedian, the Jaycees honoured him as the Outstanding Youth. Awards galore, the state's prestigious Kalaivanar Award, Iyal Isai Nataka Mandram's Kalai Maamani Award and Best Drama Troupe Award are other awards he has won. The play Adhirshtakaaran was made into a film, Krishna Krishna, with Shekher in the lead. Taking his technical proviso along with histrionics, he produced recently a television show, S. Ve. Shekher meets S. Ve. Shekher, where he is both the interviewer and interviewee. Some of the shows written by Sabhas and other agencies are Drama Superstar, Comedy King, Sirippalai Chirpi, Nathaka Vasool Chakravarthy, Nagaichuvai Nayagan, Nagaichuvai Thenral, Nagaichuvai Ilavarasan. In 2015 S. Ve. Shekar got appointed as one of the members of Central Board of Film Certification.http://www.kollyinsider.com/2015/01/s-ve-shekher-in- new-9-member-team-of.htmlhttp://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp- telangana/actordirector-jeevitha-inducted-into-censor-board/article6804048.ece ==Plays== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
