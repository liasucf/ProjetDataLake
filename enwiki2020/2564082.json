    "text": "Yucca de Lac was a high-end restaurant in Hong Kong, famous for frequently serving as a scene for the black-and-white Cantonese films made in the 1960s. Located at Tai Po Road, Ma Liu Shui, near the Chinese University of Hong Kong, it was opened in 1963 and closed on September 20, 2005. The scene of a man and woman enjoying afternoon tea under a parasol in the restaurant is part of the collective memory of many Hong Kongers. The restaurant's name is derived from \"yucca\", a species of evergreen plant, and de Lac meaning by the lake in French. ==USA branch== On March 26, 2012 the Fung Lum Restaurant Group opened a USA branch of the Yucca de lac bar and restaurant in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California.Palo Alto Weekly - New Restaurants at Stanford, June 22, 2012 ==Demolition and redevelopment== The luxury housing on the former restaurant lands The site of the restaurant was sold in 2005 to a local businessman at $380 million HKD for redevelopment as a real estate project.
