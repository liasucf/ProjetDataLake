    "text": "The California quail is the official state bird of California. This list of birds of California is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species seen naturally in the U.S. state of California as determined by the California Bird Records Committee (CBRC). As of June 30, 2020, there are 676 species on the CBRC list. Two of these species are endemic, 13 were introduced by humans (directly or indirectly), one species has been extirpated, and one was extirpated in the wild but its reintroduction is in progress. Five additional species have been documented but \"the CBRC could not reach a consensus as to whether records of these species involved true naturally occurring vagrants or escapes from captivity.\" One additional species has been added from eBird as a result of the 2020 taxonomic revisions to the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds; it is marked as a review species.R.

The Auk 2020, vol. 137:1-24 retrieved July 1, 2020 The following tags note species in each of those categories and one additional category: *(En) Endemic to California *(I) Introduced but now established in California *(Ex) Extirpated from California *(RI) Reintroduction in progress - not yet established *(*) California Bird Records Committee Review Species (200 species; in general, review species average four or fewer occurrences per year in California over the most recent ten-year period.) *(UO) Of unknown origin Individuals or even flocks of many additional species have been recorded in California but these birds are assumed to be deliberately released or escaped from captivity. In the absence of evidence of wild origin, they are not included in the CBRC list. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The taxonomic sequencing of these bird species (as opposed to alphabetical) is done to more easily enable the identification of common traits between closely related species. With taxonomic sequencing, closely related species tend to be listed adjacent to one another. ==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl== Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Canada goose American wigeon The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. * Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (*) * Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor (*) * Emperor goose, Anser canagica (*) * Snow goose, Anser caerulescens * Ross's goose, Anser rossii * Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons * Tundra bean-goose, Anser serrirostris (*) * Brant, Branta bernicla * Cackling goose, Branta hutchinsii * Canada goose, Branta canadensis * Trumpeter swan, Cygnus buccinator * Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus * Whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus (*) * Wood duck, Aix sponsa * Baikal teal, Sibirionetta formosa (*) * Garganey, Spatula querquedula (*) * Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors * Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera * Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata * Gadwall, Mareca strepera * Falcated duck, Mareca falcata (*) * Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope * American wigeon, Mareca americana * Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos * Mexican duck, Anas diazi (*) * American black duck, Anas rubripes (*) * Northern pintail, Anas acuta * Green-winged teal, Anas crecca * Canvasback, Aythya valisineria * Redhead, Aythya americana * Common pochard, Aythya ferina (*) * Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris * Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula * Greater scaup, Aythya marila * Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis * Steller's eider, Polysticta stelleri (*) * King eider, Somateria spectabilis (*) * Common eider, Somateria mollissima (*) * Harlequin duck, Histrionicus histrionicus * Surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata * White- winged scoter, Melanitta deglandi * Common scoter, Melanitta nigra (*) * Black scoter, Melanitta americana * Long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis * Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola * Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula * Barrow's goldeneye, Bucephala islandica * Smew, Mergellus albellus (*) * Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus * Common merganser, Mergus merganser * Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator * Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis ==New World quail== Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. * Mountain quail, Oreortyx pictus * California quail, Callipepla californica * Gambel's quail, Callipepla gambelii ==Pheasants, grouse, and allies== Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies, including partridges, grouse, turkeys, and Old World quail.
