    "text": "John Reno Jackson (born October 31st, 1995) is a Caymanian multidisciplinary artist. His practice is based around painting, photography, performance, and sculpture. ==Biography== Jackson attended foundation courses in painting and drawing at the Art Academy London in 2015. Jackson has exhibited work in the Winter Showcase at the Art Academy London in 2015, at Paulo \u2013 PADA Studios in Barreiro, Portugal, where he attended an artist\u2019s residency in 2020, and at Artisan Space in London, UK (2020). His work was featured in the exhibition, Island of Women: Life at Home in our Maritime Years, at National Gallery of the Cayman Islands in 2020. In his formative years, he said he found the size of Cayman limiting, but with time he has come to appreciate what the small community has to offer. His paintings, that can act as both figures and landscapes, reflect on developing a narrative around fables, social interaction, adolescence, race, and sexual identity. In late 2019, three of Jackson's works were added to the permanent collection of the National Gallery of the Cayman Islands. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:1995 births Category:Caymanian artists Category:Living people Category:Caribbean artists ",
