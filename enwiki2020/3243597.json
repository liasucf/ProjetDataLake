The neighborhood is composed of three sections. In Section 1 and the southernmost streets of Braeswood Addition, the houses were built primarily in the late 1920s and the 1930s.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p.13 et seq.

The three northernmost streets in Braeswood Addition were also built in the 1950s.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 47 et seq.

Old Braeswood is distinguished not only by its architecture, but also by residents such as those described below under \"Notable former residents.\" In 2016, the median house cost was $1,255,000. ==History== This 1935 Tudor house is at 2341 Blue Bonnet Blvd. Old Braeswood was under way by 1927 with the sale of 456 acres to Braeswood Corporation by John J. Kirby. The intent of Braeswood Corporation was to create a garden suburb of country houses along South Main Street,Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 10 with deed restrictions to protect the integrity of the neighborhood.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 12 et seq. The plan of the neighborhood was designed by Hare and Hare, the Kansas City landscape architects responsible for many garden suburbs across the country.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 8 Braeswood Corporation retained local architects to design houses, primarily in the English manorial style, selling the first house to Braeswood Corporation board member and former Texas Governor William Hobby in 1929. Ensuing development continued the vision of Braeswood Corporation.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 22 The City of Houston annexed Braeswood in 1937Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 25 and the name changed to \"Old Braeswood\" in 1982 to differentiate the neighborhood from nearby neighborhoods that were also named after the Brays Bayou, and to affirm the regard the residents held for the history of the neighborhood. Architects Wirtz & Calhoun designed this modern home at 2337 Blue Bonnet Blvd. in 1937. This Colonial Revival house was built in 1938 at 2351 Blue Bonnet Blvd. The early development of Braeswood occurred simultaneously with, and parallel to, that of two other Houston neighborhoods, River Oaks and Riverside Terrace. The three shared some of the same architects and architectural styles. Architects who shaped Old Braeswood's initial development, through the 1930s, included Harry D. Payne, Carl A. Mulvey, Cameron D. Fairchild, Charles S. Chase, Joseph Finger, Joseph W. Northrop, Jr., Hollis E. Parker, Eugene Werlin, Tom E. Lightfoot, Irving R. Klein, Maurice J. Sullivan, Lenard Gabert, Wirtz and Calhoun, Sam H. Dixon, Jr., A. B. Ellis, James I. Campbell, Theo G. Keller, Bailey A. Swenson, Harvin C. Moore, Herman Lloyd, Claude E. Hooton, and William Fred Gray. Development in Old Braeswood in 1940 and 1941 made use of some architects new to the neighborhood including Wolf and Hoyt, Otto F. Woestemeyer, Theo G. Keller, G. Ancira, Irving R. Klein, Dixon and Greenwood, and Ben F. Greenwood.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 38 et seq. Then, legal restrictions on non-essential construction during World War II brought a temporary halt to development.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 41 In the 1950s there was again a burst of development, primarily in Braeswood Extension and primarily with architect-designed interpretations of the midcentury ranch house. Architects from that era, in addition to earlier Old Braeswood architects, included Paul L\u00e1zl\u00f3, Preston M. Bolton, Joseph Krakower, Howard Barnstone, Koetter and Tharp, Anthony Cannata, and Eugene Werlin. Architect Paul L\u00e1szl\u00f3, assisted by Howard Barnstone, designed this Midcentury Modern house at 2523 Maroneal Blvd. Among the neighborhood's most widely celebrated examples of architecture are the Allen House (2337 Blue Bonnet Blvd.) designed by Wirtz and Calhoun in the Bauhaus tradition,Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 29-31 the Gordon House (2307 Blue Bonnet Blvd.) by Bolton and Barnstone in 1955 in the International style,Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 53-54 and the Herzog House (2523 Maroneal Blvd.) by Paul L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in 1952 in the Midcentury Modern style.Braeswood: An Architectural History, p. 50-51 Old Braeswood was the focus of a home tour sponsored by Rice Design Alliance in 1986. Cite Magazine published an article about the tour in its Winter 1986 issue.\"Braeswood: On the last neighborhood in Houston\". Cite Magazine, Winter 1986, p. 12 An architectural history prepared by the Anchorage Foundation of Texas for the Old Braeswood Civic Club stated in 1988: \u201cFrom Mulvey, Wirtz and Calhoun, Brochstein, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Bolton and Barnstone to the architects of the 1980s, Braeswood has continued to be a place where architecturally important houses are built in Houston.
