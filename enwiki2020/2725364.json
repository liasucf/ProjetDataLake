Phthia became the wife of Demetrius II (239-229 BC), king of Macedonia. The match was arranged by her mother Olympias, who was desirous of thus securing the powerful assistance of the Macedonian king to support herself on the throne of Epirus after the death of Alexander. ==References== *Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \"Phthia (2)\", Boston, (1867) ==Notes== \\---- Category:Ancient Epirotes in Macedon Category:Ancient Macedonian queens consort Category:3rd-century BC Greek people Category:3rd- century BC Greek women Category:Ancient princesses ",
