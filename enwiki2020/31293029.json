The result was something of a surprise to the local Liberals and Marnham in particular. In 1908, although he had retired from the Stock Exchange, he expressed a desire to stand-down from parliament due to the \"strains of parliamentary life\". In 1910 he stood down from parliament and did not contest the January General Election, which saw the Conservative Party re-gain the seat. A year later went to live at Torquay. In 1926 he served a one-year term as Mayor of Torquay;A Liberal Chronicle - Journals and Papers of J.A.Pease, 1908-1910 it was one of the rare occasions when the Town Council selected a chief magistrate from outside its own members.
