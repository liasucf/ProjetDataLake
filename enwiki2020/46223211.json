Though the venue wasn't among the four proposed venues presented to FIBA during the final bid presentation. However the Philippines lost its bid to China's for the 2019 FIBA World Cup hosting. It was planned if the Philippines' bid was successful, the Bacolod City Arena's construction was to commence in 2016 or 2017. The Bacolod City Government acquired an 8 hectare from the Philippine Reclamation Authority as part of the later's share in a reclamation project with Bacolod Real Estate Development Corp. The parcel of land was worth P600 million. The city government plans to construct the arena in the acquired reclaimed land through public-private partnership. By August 2015, a businessman has pledged to build the arena on the city's property. ==References== Category:Indoor arenas in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Bacolod Category:Basketball venues in the Philippines Category:Proposed buildings and structures in the Philippines Category:Sports in Negros Occidental ",
