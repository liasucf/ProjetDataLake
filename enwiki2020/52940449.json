    "text": "\"It's Gonna Be Alright\" is a 1995 song by Dutch house project Deep Zone with vocals by singer Ceybil Jefferies. It became a big club anthem and a chart success in Europe, peaking at number 7 in Belgium, number 14 in the United Kingdom and number 20 in the Netherlands. Outside Europe, the song peaked at number 1 in Israel in May 1996, and at number 20 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as \"a joyfully optimistic romp merging edgy house beats with keyboards that are, by turns, jazzy and retro-disco. Life in the urban lane has done wonders for Jeffries' voice, which is now far more assured and smooth.\" Michael Morley from Muzik wrote that \"this is a very classy outing with several particularly notable ingredients. The vocals are clear and forceful, there's some sterling keyboard work and the strong arrangement is a fascinating series of peaks and troughs.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995\u201396) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) | 7 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) | 14 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Israel (Israel Top-30)Israel Top-30: 1 week at No. 1 (07.05.1996) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 20 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) | 25 |- ! scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 14 |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play | 20 |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot Dance Breakouts Club Play | 2 |} ==References== Category:1995 debut singles Category:1995 songs Category:1996 singles Category:Number-one singles in Israel Category:House music songs ",
