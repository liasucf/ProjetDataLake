    "text": "Grzegorz Kr\u00f3l (born 29 April 1978) is a former Polish footballer who played as a Forward. He started his career with Lechia Gda\u0144sk aged 16, enjoying his greatest success during his 6 seasons with Amica Wronki, with whom he won the Polish Cup three times, and the Polish SuperCup twice. Other notable clubs Kr\u00f3l played for were; Lech Poznan, GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, and Polonia Warsaw. ==Career== ===Lechia Gda\u0144sk=== In his early years Kr\u00f3l was part of the youth teams with Polonia Gda\u0144sk until 1994. He joined Lechia Gda\u0144sk at the age of 16, making his league debut on 29 October 1994 aged 16 years and 6 months. During his time with Lechia the club was struggling in the league, playing 17 games and scoring 6 in the team's relegation from the II liga, and playing 30 games, scoring 2 goals, for the merger team of Olimpia-Lechia Gda\u0144sk in the during its relegation from the I liga. After the merger split, Lechia Gda\u0144sk took the place of the Olimpia-Lechia Gda\u0144sk team in the II liga. Lechia Gda\u0144sk were eventually relegated for the third time in 3 seasons, but Kr\u00f3l left for Lech Poznan midway through his third season at Lechia, playing 10 and scoring only 2. ===Lech Poznan=== Kr\u00f3l was only with Lech for 6 months, playing 11 times for the club in the I liga and scoring his only goal against Lech rivals, Legia Warsaw, as the team finished in 11th place. ===Amica Wronki=== Over the summer of 1997 Kr\u00f3l joined Amica Wronki. During his first season with Amica, Kr\u00f3l did not perform especially well, scoring only 4 goals in 29 appearances, but it was clear that Amica were entering a golden era. While the team did not particularly perform well in the league the team won the Polish Cup for the first time during the 1997\u201398 season, beating Aluminium Konin in the final with Kr\u00f3l coming on as a substitute in the 55th minute, and scoring a goal in the 118th minute after the match went to extra-time. The final however was controversial, with Konin who were seen as the better team on the day were cheated out by the referee, Marek Kowalczyk, who later received a three month ban. Amica won their first Polish SuperCup at the start of the 1998\u201399 season, with Kr\u00f3l starting the match, beating \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a 1-0. The team also won the Polish Cup the same season beating GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w 1-0 in the final. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Amica winning the double-double, beating Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w in both the Polish Cup and Polish SuperCup finals. In 2000, Amica Wronki's director, Ryszard Forbrich, was arrested for match fixing, and later sentenced to 3.5 years in prison after the Polish football corruption scandle came to light in 2005, with Ryszard Forbrich later admitting to match fixing, including the 1998 Polish Cup final. During the rest of his time with Amica, Kr\u00f3l helped the team to the Polish Cup final in 2002, and to finishing 3rd in the I liga during the 2001\u20132002 season. During his time with Amica he won a total of 5 competitions and played 134 times scoring 36 goals. ===Later career=== After leaving Amica Kr\u00f3l did not stay at another club for longer than one season. The first team he played for was with Szczakowianka Jaworzno, finishing 5th with the team in the II liga. He then played for GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, helping them win promotion to the top division playing 27 and scoring 16 as the team finished 2nd. He then joined Polonia Warsaw for 6 months, playing in the top division with Polonia, but failed to score in his 11 appearances. He dropped down a division at the start of 2006 to rejoin Lechia Gda\u0144sk, playing in the final half of the 2005\u20132006 season, and the first few games of the 2006\u20132007 season. After rejoining Lechia he made 25 appearances scoring 6 goals, with his final appearance for Lechia coming against KSZO Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski in September 2006. After Lechia he had a brief spell in Austria, with First Vienna, before going back to Poland to play for Kmita Zabierz\u00f3w in 2007, and had two short spells with Start Otwock. He retired from professional football in 2009 after his second spell with Start Otwock. ==Personal life== In his autobiography Kr\u00f3l admitted to having an addiction to gambling and alcohol during his playing career. ==Honours== Amica Wronki *I liga **Third place (1): 2001\u20132002 *Polish Cup **Winners (3): 1997\u201398, 1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000 **Runners-up (1): 2001\u20132002 *Polish SuperCup **Winners (2): 1998, 1999 **Runners-up (1): 2000 GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w *II liga **Runners-up (1): 2004\u20132005 ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Lechia Gda\u0144sk players Category:Lech Pozna\u0144 players Category:Amica Wronki players Category:Szczakowianka Jaworzno players Category:GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w players Category:Polonia Warsaw players Category:Polish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Polish expatriate footballers ",
