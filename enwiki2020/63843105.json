    "text": "Nin-kisalsi () was a Sumerian ruler of the Mesopotamian city of Adab in the mid-3rd millennium BCE, probably circa 2600 BCE. His name does not appear in the Sumerian King List, but he is known from one inscription bearing his name. The inscription, on a bowl fragment, reads: It appears from this inscription that King Mesilim of Kish was contemporary with Nin-kisalsi and probably his suzerain. Another such ruler is Lugalshaengur, Governor of Lagash, who also appears in inscriptions as a vassal of Mesilim. ==References== Category:Sumerian rulers Category:25th-century BC rulers ",
