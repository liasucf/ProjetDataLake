    "text": "Harry Bedford (1866 \u2013 January 1929) was an English rugby union footballer who played in the 1880s and 1890s. He played at representative level for England, and at club level for Batley, and Morley as a forward, e.g. front row, lock, or back row. Prior to Thursday 29 August, Batley was a rugby union club. ==Background== Harry Bedford was born in Gildersome, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and he died aged 61 in Roundhay, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. ==Playing career== ===International honours=== Harry Bedford won caps for England while at Batley in 1889 against New Zealand Natives, and in 1890 against Scotland, and Ireland. In the early years of rugby football the goal was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to try at goal, and convert the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \"score\" a try, without scoring any points. ===Change of Code=== When Batley converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Thursday 29 August 1895, Harry Bedford would have been approximately 29 years of age. Subsequently, he was not both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Batley. ==Note== ESPN states Harry Bedford's year of birth as 1866, and date of death as January 1929, making him 62\u201363 at the time of his death. FreeBMD quotes his age at the time of death as 61, which would indicate an 1867 or 1868 birth. ==References== ==External links== *Search for \"Bedford\" at rugbyleagueproject.org *Biography of Arthur Budd with an England team photograph including Harry Bedford *Search for \"Harry Bedford\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk Category:1866 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Rugby league players from Leeds Category:Rugby union players from Leeds Category:Batley Bulldogs players Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby union players Category:Morley R.F.C. players Category:Rugby union forwards ",
