    "text": "The Fountain Formation is a Pennsylvanian bedrock unit consisting primarily of conglomerate, sandstone, or arkose, in the states of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States, along the east side of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, and along the west edge of the Denver Basin. ==Origin of name== The Fountain Formation was named by geologist W. C. Cross in 1894 for exposures along Fountain Creek in El Paso County, Colorado.Cross, C.W., 1894, Description of the Pikes Peak sheet [Colorado]: U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Atlas of the United States, Pikes Peak folio, no. 7, 5 p. == Stratigraphy == Fountain Formation unconformably overlying Precambrian rocks at the parking lot of Red Rocks Park The Fountain unconformably overlies Precambrian granite and gneiss. Outcrops of the formation typically dip steeply to the east. === Depositional environment === The formation was formed by the erosion of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, and deposition by fluvial processes as alluvial fans. The characteristic predominant red color and the composition of the Fountain reflect that of the granites and gneisses from which it was eroded. === Notable outcrops === Outcrop of the Fountain Formation at Garden of the Gods. Scale bar on notebook is * Flatirons, near Boulder, Colorado * Red Rocks Park and Amphitheater, Golden, Colorado * Roxborough State Park, south of Denver, Colorado * Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, Colorado * Red Rock Canyon Open Space in Colorado Springs, Colorado === Fossils === Marine invertebrates have been discovered in a limestone and shale member of the Fountain Formation, cropping out on a low hogback in Perry Park. Invertebrates include bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, and gastropods.Ellis, C.H., 1966, Paleontologic age of the Fountain Formation south of Denver, Colorado: The Mountain Geologist, v. 3, no. 4, p. 155-160. Plant fossils have been discovered in Garden Park north of Ca\u00f1on City, including Lepidophloios laricinus, Sigillaria, Syringodendron sp., Lepidophyloides sp., Lepidostrobus sp., Lepidostrobophyllum sp., Calamites, Neuropterus sp., Cyclopteris sp., and Stigmaria ficoides.Jennings, J.R., 1980, Fossil plants from the Fountain Formation (Pennsylvanian) of Colorado: Journal of Paleontology, v. 54, no. 1, p. 149-158. == Age == Rocks of the Fountain Formation are considered to be of Late Pennsylvanian age, and are between 290 and 340 million years old. == References == == External links == * Gravmag.com: Geology of the Fountain Formation Category:Pennsylvanian North America Category:Geologic formations of Colorado Category:Carboniferous Colorado Category:Sandstone formations of the United States Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Carboniferous southern paleotropical deposits ",
