    "text": "Pauline Schaap is a Dutch cell biologist and evolutionary biologist. She is Professor of Developmental Signalling at the University of Dundee., a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. She studies the evolution of multicellularity and cell differentiation in social amoebae. == Biography == Schaap received her PhD in 1987 from the University of Leiden . She was a professor at the University of Leiden until 1999, when she moved to the University of Dundee where she is currently a professor . She became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011 . == Professional contributions == Schaap and her collaborators established the first molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelia . That work showed that complex multicellular fruiting bodies had evolved multiple times independently, contrary to what had previously been generally thought . More recently, Schaap and her team showed that the molecular pathway for multicellular development in dictyostelids had evolved from an ancestral encystment pathway present in single-celled amoebae , thus contributing to elucidating the molecular basis for the evolution of multicellularity == References == ==External links== *Pauline Schaap at Google Scholar Category:Dutch biologists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Biology Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
