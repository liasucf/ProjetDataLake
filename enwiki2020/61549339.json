    "text": "thumb Martine-Mich\u00e8le Sebag is a French computer scientist, primarily focused on machine learning. She has over 6,000 citations. Sebag studied mathematics at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and later worked in the computer science industry, starting at Thomson Corporation, where she was introduced to artificial intelligence. She then moved into the research field, at the Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique des Solides at Ecole Polytechnique. She was awarded a PhD from the University of Paris-Sud, Paris Dauphine University and Ecole Polytechnique. Sebag started work at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) as a research fellow in 1991. Sebag is deputy director of the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique at the CNRS; Head of group A-O at the latter; co-head of Projet TAO at INRIA Saclay; and principal scientist at the CNRS. She was named chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 2019. ==Selected research== *Gelly, Sylvain, et al. \"The grand challenge of computer Go: Monte Carlo tree search and extensions.\" Communications of the ACM 55.3 (2012): 106-113. *Bordes, Antoine, L\u00e9on Bottou, and Patrick Gallinari. \"SGD-QN: Careful quasi-Newton stochastic gradient descent.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 10.Jul (2009): 1737-1754. *Termier, Alexandre, M-C.
