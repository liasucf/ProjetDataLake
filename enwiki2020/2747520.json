    "text": "Rover Thomas Joolama (c. 1926 \u2013 11 April 1998) was an Indigenous Australian artist. ==Early life== Rover Thomas was born in 1926 near Gunawaggii, at Well 33 on the Canning Stock Route, in the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia. At the age of 10 Thomas and his family moved to the Kimberley where, as was usual at the time, he began work as a stockman. Later in his life Thomas lived at Turkey Creek. Rover Thomas and his Uncle Paddy Jaminji first started painting dance boards on dismembered tea chests for the Krill Krill ceremony in 1977. In the early 1980s, Rover Thomas started painting ochre on canvas and soon became a pioneer artist of what was later known as the East Kimberley School. Rover Thomas was the inspiration for many East Kimberley artists who followed including Queenie Mckenzie, Freddie Timms and Paddy Bedford ==Artist== Thomas was awarded the John McCaughey Prize in 1990 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Thomas was one of the two Aboriginal Australians to exhibit in the Venice Biennale in 1990, alongside Trevor Nickolls. He was the subject of the important solo exhibition Roads Cross: The Paintings of Rover Thomas, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra in 1994. In 2000, Thomas's work was amongst that of eight individual and collaborative groups of Indigenous Australian artists shown in the prestigious Nicholas Hall at the Hermitage Museum in Russia. The exhibition received a positive reception from Russian critics, one of whom wrote: > This is an exhibition of contemporary art, not in the sense that it was done > recently, but in that it is cased in the mentality, technology and > philosophy of radical art of the most recent times. No one, other than the > Aborigines of Australia, has succeeded in exhibiting such art at the > Hermitage. Thomas and Emily Kame Kngwarreye were amongst the most successful Australian artists in the national and global art markets ==See also== * Indigenous Australian art ==Collections== * Holmes \u00e0 Court Collection ==References== ==Bibliography== *McAlpine, Lord Alistair (2002).
