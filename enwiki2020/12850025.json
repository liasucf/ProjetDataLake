He worked on restoring, completing and refinishing sculptures destined for the Museo Pio- Clementino and provided marble revetments and sculptural details for its interiors, notably the biga (two-horse chariot) assembled in 1788 from antique elements,Including what was probably a votive marble chariot of the first century CE, which had been used as a cathedra at San Marco (Touring Club Italiano, Roma 669.) in the sala del Biga of the Braccio Nuovo. He worked for Pope Pius VI, for whom he filled a room with animal sculptures, some made up from antique fragments, in the Palazzetto del Belvedere; he also worked for the papal family at Palazzo Braschi. He died in Rome in 1818. == Some other sculptors in Rome renowned for their restorations == * Orfeo Boselli * Ippolito Buzzi * Bartolomeo Cavaceppi * Ercole Ferrata * Francesco Fontana * Francesco Nocchieri * Giovanni Battista Piranesi * Vincenzo Pacetti ==Further reading== * I.
