    "text": "Windrush Day was introduced in June 2018 on the 70th anniversary of the Windrush migration. Windrush Day is not a bank holiday in the United Kingdom, it is an observed day. It was instituted following a successful campaign led by Patrick Vernon. == History == On 22 June 1948, 492 Afro-Caribbean people were brought to Tilbury Docks, Essex, in the UK, on the Empire Windrush ship.\"Windrush: A landmark in the history of modern Britain\", The History Press. News reports at the time reported that the number of people was 492, but the ship's records show that the ship was carrying 1,027 passengers.McDowell, Linda. \"How Caribbean Mirgrants Helped to Rebuild Britain\". Windrush Stories, British Library, 4 October 2018. According to the passenger lists, 802 of those on board the ship gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. After World War II, the United Kingdom's economy needed to be repaired. In doing so, the British government recruited Afro-Caribbean migrants and offered them jobs. These jobs included the production of steel, coal, iron, and food, and also jobs in the service sector, such as running public transport and staffing the new National Health Service in the United Kingdom. The first Afro-Caribbean immigrants in the United Kingdom were faced with extreme intolerance from the majority of the white population. Although Afro-Caribbean migrants were encouraged to settle in the United Kingdom and take up employment to relieve the labour market by the authorities, many early immigrants were denied access to private employment and accommodation because of the colour of their skin. Black people were also banned from many pubs, clubs, and even churches. ==Campaign== Patrick Vernon was the first to call for the commemoration of \"Windrush Day\", to recognise the migrant contribution to UK society, on the day when the first big group of post-war migrants from the West Indies arrived in Britain.Vernon, Patrick (21 June 2013), \"Why Windrush Day matters\", British Future.Vernon, Patrick (8 July 2015), \"We need a Windrush Day to celebrate the migrant contribution to UK\", Brixton Blog. Vernon first launched a petition to this effect in 2013,\"Join calls to celebrate Windrush Day every year\", Patrick Vernon website, 2013.\"Why Windrush Day matters\", Patrick Vernon website. which was followed by a further campaign in 2018, at the height of the Windrush scandal.\"Former Hackney councillor renews call for national Windrush Day\", Hackney Citizen, 21 May 2018.Kadrolli, Erenata (25 May 2018), \"Petition launched to recognise Windrush Day\", East London Lines.Vernon, Patrick (29 May 2018),\"The Reader: We should designate a day to celebrate the Windrush's arrival\", Have Your Say, Evening Standard. Official backing was given when it was subsequently announced by the government that an annual Windrush Day would be celebrated on 22 June, supported by a grant of up to \u00a3500,000, to recognise and honour the contribution of the Windrush Generation and their descendants and to \"keep their legacy alive for future generations, ensuring that we all celebrate the diversity of Britain's history.\"Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government and Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, \"Annual day of celebrations for the Windrush Generation\" (Press release), UK Government, 18 June 2018.Badshah, Nadeem (18 June 2018), \"UK makes Windrush Day official with \u00a3500k grant to support events\", The Guardian. == Modern day == The purpose of Windrush Day is to encourage \"communities across the country to celebrate the contribution of the Windrush Generation and their descendants,\" according to the United Kingdom government. \"A Windrush Day will allow communities up and down the country to recognise and honour the enormous contribution of those who stepped ashore at Tilbury Docks 70 years ago,\" said communities minister Lord Bourne. Government funding helps a variety of events and activities to take place, such as the day dance performances, exhibitions, and debate. ==References== ==External links== * \"Windrush Day in the United Kingdom\", at timeanddate.com Category:June observances Category:Caribbean British Category:Black British history ",
