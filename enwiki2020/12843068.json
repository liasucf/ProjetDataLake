Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log is the tallest mountain in the range. ==Naming== Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log derives its name from the two glacial corries that bound each end of its high rocky summit ridge (the north-western corrie is a lake). Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log is sometimes incorrectly named as \"Barrslievenaroy\" (or \"Baurslievenaroy\") (; the mountain fort), which is a small townland on the northern slopes of the mountain that is marked in some Ordnance Survey Ireland maps. The Placenames Database of Ireland records an anglicised version as \"Benadolug\", however, this does not appear in other noted Irish mountain placename reference guides. ==Geography== Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log lies at the centre of the long north-west to south-east central spine of the Maumturks range in the Connemara National Park. The mountain has a high winding rocky summit ridge, littered in quartzite rocks and gravel, that includes the subsidiary peak of Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log SE Top at . To the southeast of the summit ridge is a large corrie (and the townland of Barrslievenaroy below), and then the 4th highest Maumturk of Binn Chaonaigh at . To the northwest of the summit ridge is an even larger corrie lake (at L 879536), with steep cliffs on its backwall, which then rises up again to the summit of Knocknahillion at . The col between Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log and Knocknahillion is the pass of Maumahoge (, and the corrie lake is called Lough Maumahoge (). Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log's prominence of qualifies it as a P600, and a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 52nd-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. ==Hill walking== The easiest way summit Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log is a 6-kilometre 3-hour route via the pass of Maumahoge; however, because of its positioning on the high rocky central spine of the central Maumturk range, it is also summited in a longer 13-kilometre 5-6 hour loop-route starting at the col of Maumeen , in the south, climbing Binn Chaonaigh and then onto the top of Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log, before descending via Maumahoge, and walking back. Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10\u201312 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \"great classic ridge-walks of Ireland\", but of \"extreme grade\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club, has run the annual \"Maamturks Challenge Walk\" (MCW), and man two checkpoints on Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log; one at the summit (the summit marks 54% of MCW climbing completed), and another at Lough Maumahoge (the Lough marks 63% of MCW climbing, and 51% of MCW distance, completed), which has a 2pm cut-off time for participants. ==Rock climbing== While the Maumturks range is not particularly known for rock climbing routes (unlike Bencorr and its Carrot Ridge spur, across the Inagh Valley), some have been developed at a crag just below and west of Lough Maumahoge (L876 532), with routes of 90 to 190 metres at climbing grades of S to HVS. ==Gallery== File:Binn idir an da Log (from south).jpg|Summit ridge of Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log viewed from the south on Binn Mhairg File:Knocknahillion and Binn idir an da Log from Letterbrackaun.jpg|View south from Letterbreckaun showing Knocknahillion (middle right), and Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log (back, middle) File:Lough Maumahoge and Knocknahillion and Letterbreckaun.jpg|Looking north from summit of Binn idir and da Log to Lough Maumahoge, Knocknahillion and Letterbreckaun File:Binn idir and da Log from the south on east spur of Letterbreckaun.jpg|Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log viewed from east spur of Letterbreckaun, with Knocknahillion on the right ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==See also== *Twelve Bens, major range in Connemara *Mweelrea, major range in Killary Harbour *Lists of mountains in Ireland *Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles *List of P600 mountains in the British Isles *List of Marilyns in the British Isles *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland ==References== ==External links== *The Maamturks Challenge, University College Galway Mountaineering Club *The Maamturks Challenge: Routecard (2015) *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Binn idir an d\u00e1 Log *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\"DoBIH\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Galway Category:Mountains under 1000 metres Category:Climbing areas of Ireland ",
