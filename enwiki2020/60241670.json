    "text": "Abraham of Toledo (\u20131294), also known as Abraham Alfaqu\u00edn and Abraham Ibn Waqar, was an Iberian Jewish physician and translator of the Toledo School of Translators. He served as personal physician to Alfonso X of Castile and his son Sancho IV of Castile, under whose patronage he translated numerous books from Arabic into Castilian. Together with five other prominent court Jews, he was kidnapped and held hostage from 1270 to 1275 by rebellious nobles demanding the elimination of taxes. He translated in 1263 the Kitab al-Miraj ('The Book of Muhammad's Ladder'), an account of the Mi'raj, into Castilian under the title La escala de Mahoma. His Castilian translation was in turn translated into French by the same year, the first book on the subject of Muhammad's prophethood presented to a French lay audience. He later translated (after 1270) a cosmographical work of Alhazen under the title Libro de la constituci\u00f3n del universo (Arabic: Kitab fi Hay\u2019at al-\u02bfAlam), and revised a 1277 translation of Arzachel's Libro de la A\u00e7afeha (Arabic: al-Safi\u1e25a) by Ferdnando of Toledo found unsatisfactory by the King. ==References== Category:1225 births Category:1294 deaths Category:13th-century Jews Category:13th-century translators Category:Arabic\u2013Spanish translators Category:Medieval Castilian Jews Category:Medieval Jewish physicians of Spain Category:Medieval Jewish writers Category:13th-century Castilians ",
