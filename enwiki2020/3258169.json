The town is situated approximately south-east of Croatia's second largest city, Split. Its location is where the Cetina River meets the Adriatic Sea. Omi\u0161 municipality has a population of 14,936 and its area is . ==Name== It is supposed that the name of this city, Omi\u0161, developed from the Slavic Holm, Hum as a translation from the Illyrian - Greek word Onaion, Oneon, meaning \"hill\" or \"place on the hill\", or from Greek onos (\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) meaning donkey, perhaps from the shape of the rocky promontory by the city (naming a city after a natural form was common practice then, as it is now); there is also the possibility that the name of the settlement Onaeum was derived from the name of the river which was called Nestos by the Greek colonists in its lower flow, during Antiquity. According to Petar \u0160imunovi\u0107, Omi\u0161 is derived from Proto-Indo-European *almissa (\"rock\", \"cliff\"). Latin names during Ancient Rome were Onaeum, Oeneum, Alminium, and Almissum. During Medieval times the name was recorded as Olmissium, Almiyssium and from the end of the 15th century, when the city fell to the authority of Venetian Republic, its name was the Italian Almissa. ==History== Omi\u0161 Historical Coat of Arms from year 1541. Omi\u0161 was well known in the past by the Corsairs of Almissa (Omi\u0161ki gusari) whose Sagittas (ships) (Genitive case: Sagittae, translated as The Arrow), brought fame to them because they were built for attack and fast retrieval into the mouth of the Cetina River, protecting the town from foreign invaders. At a very early date, neighbours of the Corsairs of Almissa, the highlanders of the Poljica Principality (Polji\u010dka Republika), became their friends and allies. This allowed them to harass the seaborne trade, without fear of a sudden attack from inland. *Historical monuments: ** Church of St Euphemia by the coast on Brzet, from the early 6th century ** Mirabella Fortress (Peovica) from the 13th century ** Starigrad Fortress (Fortica) from the 15th century ** Renaissance church of the Holy Spirit from the 15th century ** Old cemetery, the 16th century or 17th century ** Parochial church from the 17th century ** Franciscan Monastery on Skalice from the 18th century In the Priko neighborhood, on the right bank of the Cetina River, stands the site with the most historic significance: the pre-Romanesque Church of St. Peter (Crkva Sv.
