Operaatio Hurrikaani is a production of YLE (Finnish Broadcasting Company). ==The story== Puuma (Puma) is a young fellow, who leads a double life: everybody thinks he's studying to become a teacher but actually he's a top secret agent. He has to fight against Tohtori Routa (Dr. Freeze) and his evil plans. Puuma gets help from his curious aunt Sirkku, from an older agent Postimies and from a beautiful and hardworking girlagent Kleopatra. ==How it works== Each week the TV-show has a drama episode, which ends with a question and three alternatives. After that kids can log on to the website and help Puuma by giving their answer. Doing so they earn themselves a new mini-game, which they can use to train their skills as a secret agent. They also have an avatar, which can be modified by changing clothes, hair styles and spy gear. Then on the TV-show at the following week, the correct answer for the question is shown. There's a prize draw for all participating agents. The winners are shown as the avatars they have created online in the weekly TV-show. ==The cast== Puuma \"Puma\" Tomi Alatalo Sirkku Iina Suominen Postimies \"Postman\" Olli L\u00f6yt\u00f6nen Kleopatra Hanna Salo Aleksandra Maria Isotalo Routa \"Dr. Freeze\" Olli Mononen ==Seasons== === 1st season, episodes 1-20=== Aired 2007 === 2nd season, episodes 21-40=== Aired 2008 === 3rd season, episodes 41-50=== Aired 2009 ===4th season, episodes 51-70=== Aired 2009-2010 ==Website== * http://www.yle.fi/operaatiohurrikaani/ Category:Finnish children's television series ",
