Reno's most notable sculpture is titled Secretariat\u201431 Lengths which is on display at the National Museum of Racing at Saratoga, New York. He was also commissioned in 1973 by Secretariat's owner Penny Chenery (Tweedy) to sculpt a life-size bronze of the horse for the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, KY. Reno also sculpted Dash For Cash, cattleman Charles Goodnight, Comanche Indian Chief Quannah Parker, and many other depictions of legendary people and horses. Reno raised and trained cutting horses, and competed in NCHA cutting horse events. He served two terms as president of the NCHA, served twenty-one years on the NCHA executive committee, and was inducted into the NCHA Members Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American horse trainers Category:Equine artists Category:American sculptors Category:NCHA Hall of Fame (members) ",
