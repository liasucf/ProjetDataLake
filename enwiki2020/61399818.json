After graduating in 1934 with a master's degree, Wheeler worked for the U.S. Forest Service in the Siskiyou Mountains and in the Angeles National Forest within the San Gabriel Mountains.

From 1939 to 1945 Wheeler was a botany instructor and research assistant at several different universities. At the University of Southern California, he became an assistant professor in 1945 and was eventually promoted to associate professor and then full professor, retiring as professor emeritus in 1975. The Flora of Ceylon Project was supported by the Smithsonian Institution, the Ceylon Department of Agriculture, and the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya.
