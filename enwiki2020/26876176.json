    "text": "The Australian Oxford Dictionary, sometimes abbreviated as AOD, is a dictionary of Australian English published by Oxford University Press.Warden, Ian \"Some Balltearers For The Scrabble Board\" 27 October 1999 Canberra Times P7 The AOD combines elements of the previous Oxford publication, The Australian National Dictionary (sometimes abbreviated as AND), which was a comprehensive, historically based record of 10,000 words and phrases representing Australia's contribution to English. However, The Australian National Dictionary was not a full dictionary, and could not be used as one in the normal sense. The AOD borrowed its scholarship both from the AND and from The Oxford English Dictionary, and competed with the Macquarie Dictionary when it was released in 1999. Like the Macquarie, the AOD combines elements of a normal dictionary with those of an encyclopaedic volume.Lockwood, Kim. \"A New Aussie Monolith\" 27 October 1999 Herald Sun p 31 It is a joint effort of Oxford University and the Australian National University.\"Reading between the lines\". 28 October 1999 The Advertiser p 19 The AODs current editor is Bruce Moore. Its content is largely sourced from the databases of Australian English at the Australian National Dictionary Centre and The Oxford English Dictionary. It also draws on the latest research into International English. The second edition contains more than 110,000 headwords and more than 10,000 encyclopaedic entries.Australian Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press web site ==Publications== ===Australian Oxford Dictionary=== *First edition (): *Second edition (Australian Oxford Dictionary Second Edition) (/): Includes over 110,000 headwords. :*?th impression (2004-12-06) ===Australian Oxford Paperback Dictionary=== *Second edition (/): :*?th impression (1996-12-01) *Fourth (fifth?) edition (): Includes over 70,000 headwords. :*/ (includes 12 months free access to the Online Australian Dictionary & Thesaurus) ::*?th impression (2011-11-07) ::*?th impression (2012-04-05) ==References== ==External links== *Oxford University Press page: Australian Oxford Dictionary (2 ed.), Australian Oxford Paperback Dictionary 5th edition *Oxford Reference page: 2nd edition *Australian National University page: Oxford Dictionaries *WordWeb page: Australian Oxford Dictionary Category:Australian books Category:Australian English Category:English dictionaries Category:Oxford dictionaries ",
