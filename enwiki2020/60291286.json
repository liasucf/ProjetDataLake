In 1915 he returned to Kentucky where he bought out his brother William's share in Xalapa Farm near Paris, Kentucky, a property they had inherited from their father. Edward Simms would become a successful breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses. Edward Simms died December 6, 1938 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland where he had been undergoing treatment for leukemia. ==References== Category:1871 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Yale University alumni Category:University of Virginia School of Law alumni Category:Businesspeople from Kentucky Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:American businesspeople in the oil industry Category:Texas Oil Boom people Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:People from Paris, Kentucky Category:Burials at Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas) ",
