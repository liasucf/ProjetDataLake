    "text": "Satti is a common food in Mindanao, Philippines. Its main ingredients are small pieces of beef, grilled on hot coals until it becomes red-black in color. Eaten together with rice cooked in coconut leaves, it is dazed on a red-coloured, spicy sauce. The Indonesian and Malaysian version of satti is known as sate or satay. Satti is also a breakfast meal of the local residents in Zamboanga in the Philippines. In Zamboanga, satti shops sometimes open up as early as 4am and by around midday they are closing for the day. Although the satay in Malaysia is similar to regular BBQ, the satti has only three small strips of roasted meat on a stick. The meat can be made or come from beef, pork, liver or chicken. ==References== Category:Street food Category:Meat dishes Category:Malaysian cuisine Category:Philippine cuisine Category:Breakfasts ",
