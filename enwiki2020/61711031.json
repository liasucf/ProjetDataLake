He played U Sports football with the Ottawa Gee-Gees from 2014 to 2017. ==University career== Bennett played in 23 games for the Ottawa Gee-Gees in 2014, 2016, and 2017 as a defensive back and linebacker. Following shoulder surgery in August 2015, he sat out the 2015 season. Over those three seasons, he accumulated 89 solo tackles, 39 assisted tackles, one sack, and three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. He was also featured on punt and kick returns, recording 40 kick returns for a 26.3-yard average with two touchdowns and 19 punt returns for a 10.0-yard average. In his final year with the Gee-Gees in 2017, he was named an OUA First Team All-Star on defence, an OUA Second Team All-Star on special teams, and was named the University of Ottawa Male Athlete of the year. ==Professional career== Bennett was drafted as a defensive back in the second round, 11th overall by the Hamilton Tiger- Cats in the 2018 CFL Draft and signed with the team on May 20, 2018. He made the team following training camp and played in his first CFL game on June 16, 2018 against the Calgary Stampeders as a back up defensive back.

For the 2019 season, Bennett began training camp with the team's offence as a running back, a position that he had played in high school, indicating that the Tiger-Cats were planning on playing a Canadian there. He began the season as a backup running back and in the first game of the season, had three rushing attempts for -6 yards. He primarily played on special teams until injuries to Sean Thomas Erlington, Maleek Irons, and Cameron Marshall brought him into the spotlight for the Labour Day Classic against the Toronto Argonauts. In that game, he had 105 yards of total offence, with 12 carries for 77 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 28 yards. The 25-yard touchdown run was the first professional touchdown of his career and tied the game with the following convert proving to be the game- winning point. ==Personal life== Bennett grew up in Ottawa and has two siblings, older sister Dria and younger brother Carter. ==References== ==External links== * Tiger-Cats bio * Gee-Gees bio Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian football defensive backs Category:Canadian football running backs Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats players Category:Ottawa Gee-Gees football players Category:Players of Canadian football from Ontario Category:Sportspeople from Ottawa ",
