John Isner won his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final, 6\u20137(4\u20137), 6\u20134, 6\u20134. Isner became the first new Miami Open champion in 9 years. Federer and Rafael Nadal (despite having withdrawn from the event) were in contention for the ATP No. 1 singles ranking at the start of the tournament. Nadal regained the top ranking as a result of Federer's second round loss. With Novak Djokovic and Federer losing their opening matches and Andy Murray and Nadal missing the tournament due to injuries, this was the first time since the 2004 Paris Masters that none of the members of the Big Four won a match at a Masters 1000 tournament. ==Seeds== All seeds receive a bye into the second round. ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==Qualifying== ===Seeds=== ===Qualifiers=== ===Lucky loser=== ===Qualifying draw=== ====First qualifier==== ====Second qualifier==== ====Third qualifier==== ====Fourth qualifier==== ====Fifth qualifier==== ====Sixth qualifier==== ====Seventh qualifier==== ====Eighth qualifier==== ====Ninth qualifier==== ====Tenth qualifier==== ====Eleventh qualifier==== ====Twelfth qualifier==== == References == ==External links== *Main draw *Qualifying draw Category:2018 Miami Open Category:Men in Florida ",
