The house and gardens are open to the public. == House == In 1552, C\u00f4me Clausse, a notary and royal secretary to the King, acquired from the Lapite family the former seigneurial dwelling at Courances, at the western edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau. His heir conveyed it in 1622 to Claude Gallard, another royal secretary, who is doubtless the builder of the present ch\u00e2teau, of an H-plan laid out on a rectangular platform that is surrounded by moat. The original ch\u00e2teau is known from the engravings of Isra\u00ebl Henriet and Isra\u00ebl Silvestre, about 1650. The evaluation of the property drawn up in 1638 mentions, apart from the manor house, four barns, a press-house, two wheat mills, and two mills \"straddling the river\". \"Above and beyond this is a mill called the fulling mill, with the forecourt of said chateau on one side, and the stream of the pond on the other\", it says. In the 18th century the house was modernized by Anne- Catherine Gallard, widow of Nicolas Potier de Novion, who opened up a proper cour d'honneur by demolishing the wall and entryway that had enclosed the courtyard. Later her granddaughter L\u00e9ontine-Philippine de Novion and her husband Aymar de Nicolay further modernized the ch\u00e2teau (1775\u20131777) by opening new bays and applying a large pedimented center to each fa\u00e7ade. In 1830, the Nicolay heirs (see Nicolay family) conveyed away the ch\u00e2teau, which was bought in 1872 by Baron Samuel de Haber. For him the architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur restored the ch\u00e2teau in a Louis XIII style, in a campaign that lasted from 1873 to 1884. Destailleur retrieved the brickwork from beneath a layer of stucco, raised the rooflines of the pavilions and supplied zinc ornaments for the roofs. The grand internal staircase was demolished and monumental ramps of Fontainebleau inspiration were applied to the fa\u00e7ades. A new wing with broken roofline was erected over the former kitchens to shelter the master suites, and was linked to the old wing by a gallery. New outbuildings constructed at the same time were destroyed by fire in 1976. In the First World War, Courances served as a hospital. In the Second World War, it was first occupied by the Germans, then by Field Marshal Montgomery, serving as Chairman of the Western Union Commanders-in-Chief Committee, from 1947 to 1954. == Park == Fa\u00e7ade of the ch\u00e2teau. Courances has been acclaimed as \"the epitome of the French formal garden style in which ch\u00e2teau and environment form a whole\".Georges L\u00e9v\u00eaque, Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Val\u00e9ry. French Garden Style. . Page 16. The garden's traditional attribution to Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre is undocumented and dubious.Thierry Mariage. The World of Andre Le Notre. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999. . Page 22. Actually, natural expanses of water at Courances stand in sharp contrast to the fountain machinery employed by Le N\u00f4tre at Versailles and elsewhere. This was noted approvingly by Jacques Dulaure in the 18th century: \"Nature has created this effect of ever-flowing water, an effect far superior to those pompous cascades which by mighty effort live for a moment and then die down, as if a painting were to vanish all at once from its frame\". In 1870, Destailleur transformed the park to a landscape park \u00e0 l'anglaise. Of the seventeenth-century garden, some bones survived when Achille Duch\u00eane began to remake it for the marquise de Ganay, granddaughter of baron de Haber; the grounds retained an entrance avenue of plane trees, the central all\u00e9e d'honneur between flanking canals and the grand axial perspective centered on the ch\u00e2teau, with its basins and a grand canal. The marquise de Novion's eighteenth-century reflecting tank also remained. Duch\u00eane re-established the French garden by recreating it in novel ways, setting long straight canals in curbs of stone on either side of the central stretch of lawn, and inventing Baroque scrolling designs in clipped box set in panels of gravel. The vista leading south from the house is made to narrow in the distance, giving it an illusion that makes it appear much longer than it actually is. His also is the fountain of Ar\u00e9thuse, formerly surmounted by a marble nymph that had been sculpted in 1711 by Claude Poirier for Marly. (The statue was acquired in 2005 by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre). In 1930, surprisingly, Duch\u00eane and Mme de Ganay also created a Japanese hill-and-pond stroll garden. The park has undergone further restoration since 1948. ==Notes== ==External links== *Ch\u00e2teau de Courances * Courances, Chateau de Courances, Chateau de Category:Landscape design history of France Category:Historic house museums in \u00cele-de-France Category:Museums in Essonne Category:Western Union (alliance) ",
