    "text": "The .416 Taylor is a rifle cartridge. According to Ken Waters in Pet Loads, it was created by Robert Chatfield-Taylor in the early 1970s, with the first rifle in this caliber being a factory barreled Winchester Model 70. The case is based on the .458 Winchester Magnum necked down to accept .416 caliber bullets. ==Usage== The .416 Taylor uses a bullet diameter. With maximum loads, the cartridge is capable of propelling a bullet at an average of from a barrel Alphin, Arthur B. ed Alphin, Arthur B. Alphin An Shot You Want (Bedford, KY: On Target Press, 1996), p.513 yielding a muzzle energy of . The work on this caliber (performed by Waters) was done with an experimental factory Ruger Model 77. He reported that an absolute maximum load of certain listed powders would push a bullet to , thereby equaling (and perhaps exceeding) the performance of the .416 Rigby (presuming moderate temperatures and barometric pressures). Waters also reported that bullets could exceed when propelled by certain listed powders. Under normal hunting conditions, the Taylor cartridge is therefore capable of taking any of the largest and most dangerous game animals in the world. Reports from various internet gunboards indicate that shooters and gunsmiths are rebarreling Browning BAR .338 Winchester Magnum rifles with .416 Taylor barrels thereby creating semi-automatic hunting rifles in a true dangerous game caliber.http://www.subguns.com/boards/semimsg.cgi?read=177929 ==Origin== The cartridge was created to replace the magnum length .416 Rigby which at that time was nearly obsolete, with a cartridge that would fit into a standard length bolt-action rifle. The shorter action rifles are not only easier to carry in heavy cover, but also make it more convenient to carry more ammunition. The advantages to cartridges in .416 inch bullet diameter are that they generally present the shooter with less recoil and flatter trajectory than the larger .458 caliber dangerous game rifles (like the .458 Winchester Magnum). They also have more striking power and penetration than medium bores like the .375 H&H; Magnum. The Taylor cartridge is simply a necked down .458 Winchester Magnum with no changes. They have the same shoulder height and angle as the .264 Winchester Magnum. The 416 Taylor was a SAAMI standardized cartridge,Alphin, Arthur B. ed Alphin, Arthur B. Alphin An Shot You Want (Bedford, KY: On Target Press, 1996), p.511 and was offered as a standard production item by A-Square until it closed in 2011. ==See also== *List of rifle cartridges *10 mm caliber ==References== 416 Taylor Category:Wildcat cartridges ",
