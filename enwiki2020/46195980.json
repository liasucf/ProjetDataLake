Retrieved from http://epaper.chinadailyasia.com/focus-hk/article-2534.html ==Impact== Customers can dress in whatever ways they like and take as many photos until they are satisfied. Therefore, posting those photos on social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram has become a prevalent phenomenon. This behaviour, as much as we can observe, is exceptionally common in Hong Kong. The selfie studio allows customers to take group selfies with 2-10 people. It turns the solo activity into an opportunity for people to gather with their friends. The quality of the selfie shoots in studios with lighting and professional cameras are better than those taken with mobile phones. Customers can create different images of themselves with the use of props and costumes. This does not only allow the customers to bring their creativeness into full play, but also allows them to express their ideal selves through the selfies.14\\. Chow, Y.W.
