Annually, almost half of all immigrants to Canada settle in the Greater Toronto Area. A study released by the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) in December 2012 found that 66 percent of students ages 4 through 18 came from visible minorities. East Asians made the largest ethnic group (33 percent) along with South Asians (28 percent) coming in second of the city of Toronto's overall population.

For instance, visible minorities as a percentage of the population only marginally increased, or even decreased (Toronto-Danforth, Parkdale-High Park, Toronto Centre, and, in the 2006\u20132011 period, Davenport) in the \"Old\" Toronto, East York and South Etobicoke ridings, while on the other hand increased significantly in Scarborough and North York.
