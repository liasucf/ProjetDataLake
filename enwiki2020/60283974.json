    "text": "The Moto Z3 (stylized as Moto z\u00b3 by Motorola and not to be confused with the Moto Z3 Play) is an Android smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility, as the successor to the Moto Z2 Force Edition. It is the world's first 5G-upgradable smartphone. Like all of Motorola's smartphones in the Moto Z series, it supports Motorola's magnetically attachable \"MotoMods\" modules.Cheng, Roger. \"This is Verizon's first 5G smartphone\", Cnet, United States, 8 January 2019. Retrieved on 19 March 2019.Eun-Jin, Kim. \"Motorola Set to Release 5G Smartphone Moto Z3\", BusinessKorea, Korea, 18 March 2019. Retrieved on 20 March 2019.Gartenberg, Chaim. \"Verizon and Motorola\u2019s 5G Moto Mod is available for preorder starting on March 14th\", The Verge, United States, 13 March 2019. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. == Specifications == === Hardware === The Moto Z3 is 76.5mm wide, 156.5mm long and 6.75mm thick, with a polished aluminum frame, a glass rear and a 2.5d glass front. The back of the Moto Z contains pogo pin connectors used to communicate with \"MotoMod\" accessories designed for the device. The phone features a OLED screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, with microSD expansion up to 2TB. Moto Z3 utilizes a USB-C connector, and does not include a 3.5mm headphone jack, headphones must be used with a USB port adapter or over Bluetooth. Unlike the previous Z2, the Z3 lacks an internal FM Radio receiver. The phone is Splash- resistant p2i. The phone has an 8MP front facing wide-angle (84\u00b0) camera, 2.0 aperture, 1.12\u03bcm with screen flash. The front camera is capable of up to 1080p 30fps video capture. Dual 12MP rear cameras 2.0 aperture, 1.25\u03bcm capable of up to 4K () at 30fps video capture. === Software === The phone includes the operating system (OS) Android Oreo 8.1.0. It can now be upgraded to Android 9.0 (Pie). === Accessories === The Moto Z features an accessory system known as \"Moto Mods\". Mods are case-like accessories that are attached to the rear of the Moto Z via a series of magnets. Using the pogo pin connectors, Mods can communicate with the device to provide additional functionality. Mods are hot swappable, and are automatically detected by the operating system software once installed. Motorola provides a relatively wide array of these \"Moto Mods\" in various departments such as photography and entertainment. However, there are reports that indicated Motorola's diminished interest in its MotoMods modular concept, which was initially expected to give the flagship Motorola phones edge in a highly competitive Android market. This is attributed to a recent move on the part of the company to scale back on its partnership with third-party MotoMod makers. The company also confirmed previously reported layoffs, which was acknowledged to have affected less than two percent of its global workforce. == Reception == TechRadar noted the phone's \"stylish design\" and primarily its 5G up-gradable feature. On the contrary, it noted that the \"Snapdragon 835 chip is outdated\".Lumb, David. \"Best Moto phones 2019: finding the best Moto smartphone for you\", TechRadar, United Kingdom, 18 March 2019. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. A TechRadar review also stated, \"The Moto Z3 won't turn heads with its simple design and lack of flagship features, but it's a surprisingly powerful phone at a bargain price. Which would be enough to recommend the phone \u2013 but it's also Verizon's secret weapon to get folks in the 5G door at a lower cost by buying the Z3 and a 5G Moto Mod. But how it will perform on the network has yet to be seen.\" DigitalTrends said, \"The Moto Z3 brings strong performance, an all-day battery, and an affordable price tag. The potential of 5G aside, it\u2019s the best option for Verizon subscribers looking for a sub-$500 phone.\" \"If you\u2019re on Verizon looking for a mid-range smartphone, you\u2019ll be satisfied with the Moto Z3. The 5G Moto Mod is nice, but it shouldn\u2019t be the primary attraction for buying this phone, since it\u2019s so limited in availability.\" == References == Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Motorola mobile phones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2018 Category:Mobile phones Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras ",
