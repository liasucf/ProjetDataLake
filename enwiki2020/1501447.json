    "text": "Dunamuggy () is a townland of 172 acres in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It is situated in the civil parish of Donegore and the historic barony of Antrim Upper. ==Archaeology== The name probably comes from a motte in the east of the townland. The Ordnance Survey Memoir of 1838 records a tumulus 18 ft high, outside of which was a parapet varying in height from 2 to 6 ft. The mound seemed to be constructed of stone and covered with earth. The motte is a Scheduled Historic Monument at grid ref: J2274 9059. == See also == *List of townlands in County Antrim *List of places in County Antrim ==References== Category:Townlands of County Antrim Category:Civil parish of Donegore Category:Archaeological sites in County Antrim ",
