Ragnhild Skoftesdotter was married to Dag Eilivsson who was associated with the founding of Gims\u00f8y Abbey. They were the parents of several children, among them Baugeid Dagsdatter. The family resided on the farm Bratsberg (Bratsberg gaard i Gjerpen) in Gjerpen (now Telemark). Ragnhild Skoftesdotter lived just prior to the beginning of the civil war era in Norway. During a portion of that time, Norway was ruled jointly by three half-brothers; Inge, Sigurd and Eystein. All three were recognized as sons of King Harald Gille and joint heirs to the throne of Norway. This arrangement ultimately resulted in a power-struggle pitting brother against brother. Ragnhild Skoftesdotter was the mother of two sons (Vatnorm Dagsson and Gregorius Dagsson) both of whom would play key roles within this power- struggle as supporter in the cause of King Inge. ==References== ==External links== *Leif Inge Ree Petersen Norwegian history from 800 to 1130 (Store norske leksikon) *Hans Reynolds Gims\u00f8y kloster ved Skien (Norig, Skein) *Gregorius Dagsson (lokalhistoriewiki.no) Category:12th-century deaths Category: People from Telemark Category:12th-century Norwegian people Category:Norwegian landowners Category:Medieval Norwegian nobility ",
