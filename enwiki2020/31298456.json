    "text": "5-(Nonyloxy)tryptamine is a tryptamine derivative which acts as a selective agonist at the 5-HT1B receptor. Increasing the O-alkoxy chain length in this series gives generally increasing potency and selectivity for 5-HT1B, with highest activity found for the nonyloxy derivative, having a 5-HT1B binding affinity of 1.0 nM, and around 300-fold selectivity over the related 5-HT1A receptor. == See also == * 5-Benzyloxytryptamine * 5-Carboxamidotryptamine * 5-Ethoxy-DMT * Sumatriptan == References == Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Tryptamines Category:Indole ethers at the benzene ring ",
