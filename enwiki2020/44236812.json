The school was established by the Religious of Christian Education order of nuns in 1889 and moved to the current site when the order purchased the house and grounds in 1927. It is now set in an expansive park including Grade I Listed buildings. ==History== Thomas Longman, the publisher, began building the house at Farnborough Hill in 1860. The exiled Empress Eug\u00e9nie, widow of Emperor Napoleon III of France, later bought and expanded the house in 1880. The Napoleonic bee symbol can be seen in the internal and external decor of the building and is also present on the school badge. The Empress bought other land in Farnborough at around the same time and founded St Michael's Abbey as a mausoleum for her husband's body (relocated from its initial burial place in Chislehurst) and that of her recently deceased son the Prince Imperial who had died while serving with the British forces during the Anglo-Zulu War. The Empress was close friends with Queen Victoria and later become godmother to Victoria Eug\u00e9nie of Battenberg, daughter of Princess Beatrice. The Empress died, age 94, in 1920. The history of the school itself began in 1889 when the Religious of Christian Education established a convent boarding school in Farnborough nearby the hill on which the current school stands called Hillside Convent College and a day school called St Mary's.http://www.farnborough-hill.org.uk/History With the outbreak of war in 1915 the school buildings was commandeered resulting in the temporary closure of both schools. The religious community and Hillside school relocated to Sycamore House (also known as The Sycamores) which was expanded in 1916 to accommodate the reopened day school. At the end of the war the original school buildings were renovated and the school returned to Hillside Convent College in 1921, while the religious community remained at The Sycamores. The school continued to grow and Mother Roantree continued to search for alternative accommodation. Following the death in 1926 of Prince Victor Boneparte, heir to the estate, the trustees of the estate put the house and grounds for sale. The community purchased the house at Farnborough Hill in 1927, both the school and Religious community moved into the House and the Sycamores was sold. The community commissioned Adrian Gilbert Scott to design additional school buildings which included the school chapel. Over the years there has been further expansion, all of it in keeping with this Grade One listed building. In 1994, the Religious of Christian Education transferred ownership to The Farnborough Hill Trust and the school is now under lay management and in 1996 appointed the school's first lay headmistress. == Headmistresses == *1891-1927 Mother Roantree *1927-1935 Mother Mason *1935-1958 Mother Horan *1958-1973 Mother Rosemary Alexander *1973-1983 Sister Mary Dawson *1983-1986 Sister Sylvia Cousins *1986-1996 Sister Elizabeth McCormack *1996-1997 Miss Rita McGeogh *1997-2007 Miss Jacqueline Thomas *2007-2016 Mrs Sarah Buckle *2016\u2013present Mrs Alexandra Neil == Facilities == The school has a mixture of historic and modern buildings.
