    "text": "Keawepoepoe was the son and keiki ali\u02bbi (prince or child of a chief) of ali\u02bbi nui (great noble or king) Lonoikahaupu and ali\u02bbi nui wahine (great noblewoman or queen) Kalanikauleleiaiwi who became father of the royal twins, Kamanawa and Kame\u02bbeiamoku. He was born sometime in the 1700s and was the youngest child of his mother, who was also the wife and half sister of Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku. His name means; \"round Keawe\". Due to his high rank from both parents as well as his father's status as a Kauaian Lono priest, Keawepoepoe was given the kapu o pahenakalani (the prostrating kapu). His lineage through his mother makes him a descendant of Haloa through Keakealanikane. ==Birth and early life== Lonoikahaupu, who had peacefully inherited the western side of Kauai as ruler, had embarked on a tour of the islands along with a huge entourage of double hulled canoes carrying musicians, dancers as well as the monarch's main navigator, priest, astrologer and an entire retinue of attendants. He may have visited Oahu, Molokai and Maui and then set off to visit the Island of Hawaii, which was ruled by Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku and his half sister Kalanikauleleiaiwi. Lonoikahaupu was entertained with festivities and amusements for weeks by the royal couple of Hawaii Island. During this period Kalanikauleleiaiwi became captivated with the Kauaian ruler and took him as one of her recognized husbands. From this union Keawepoepoe was born. He was the youngest child and possibly his mother's favorite. As he grew he was considered a handsome young man who charmed many young women. As the son of Kalanikauleleiaiwi and Lonoikahaupu, monarch's of several kingdoms between them, Keawepoepoe was an ali\u02bbi (noble) of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai. As well being the an ali\u02bbi nui (great king or supreme monarch) Lonoikahaupu was a kahuna (priest) of the order of Lono (order of Nahulu or Holoa'e), one of two priestly orders, K\u016b (Kuali'i or Kauali'i) being the other. Through this union Keawepoepoe received the kapu o pahenakalani (the prostrating kapu) which is how the Hawaii ali\u02bbi received the kapu (a religious code of conduct) called the kapu moe. In the Hawaiian language Keawepoepoe translates as; \"round Keawe\". ===Lineage=== Keawepoepoe, Alapainui and Kauaua a Mahi were all descendants of Luahine (k), who was the youngest of three brothers including Palena and Paia, all of whom were of the same mother and father. The three brothers had saved the life of Kuaana when Keakealaniwahine ordered his death by drowning. The brothers persuaded the monarch to set him adrift on a raft rather than having him put to death. Once the raft had drifted out of the site of land, the three brothers aided Kuaana to a safe landing on Maui. The Luahine descendants connect to the lineage of Haloa through Keakealanikane. ==Wives, children and grandchildren== Keawepoepoe was the father of Keeaumoku P\u0101paiahiahi, the royal Twins, Kamanawa and Kame\u02bbeiamoku as well as Alapai Maloiki and Kaulunae. The first thee three brothers, along with Keawe-a-Heulu were the principle warriors that assisted Kamehameha I conquer all but the island of Kauai. Keeaumoku's mother was K\u016bma\u02bbaik\u016b, who was also the mother of Alapai Maloiki and Kaulunae. Abraham Fornander mentions Keeaumoku as the son of Keawepoepoe several times. In; \"The Polynesian Race Volume II\" on page 132 Fornander states all three, Keeaumoku, Kamanawa and Kame\u02bbeiamoku are the sons of Keawepoepoe however, on page 154 he also states that Kamanawa and Kame\u02bbeiamoku were the \"tabbooed twin children of Kekaulike (King of Maui)\". While there are legends that refer to Kamanawa and Kame\u02bbeiamoku as the children of Kekaulike, Fornander stated that all the genealogies he had seen have Keawepoepoe as their father and Kanoena, daughter of Lonoanahulu (k) of the Ehu family. According to Almira Hollander Pitman in her 1931 publication; \"After fifty years: an appreciation, and a record of a unique incident\", Pitman states that Kanoena was Keawepoepoe's cousin. His grandchildren include Ulum\u0101heihei Hoapili who was the father of Kuini Liliha. Hoapili was the son of Kame\u02bbeiamoku making him cousins to Ka\u02bbahumanu and her brothers and sisters, Kal\u0101kua Kaheiheim\u0101lie, Kahekili Ke\u02bbeaumoku II, Kuakini, and Namahana Pi\u02bbia, the children of Keeaumoku P\u0101paiahiahi.. Through Kamanawa, Keawepoepoe had another granddaughter by the name of Peleuli. She became a wife of Kamehameha I shortly before the monarch took her cousin Ka\u02bbahumanu as another wahine (wife). ==Legacy== Keawepoepoe's descendants include the families of Liliha, Hoolulu, Kinimaka, Piianaia, Keeaumoku II and the House of Kaw\u0101nanakoa. He is a direct ancestor of King William Charles Lunalilo through his mother Kek\u0101uluohi, as well as both King David Kal\u0101kaua and Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani through their father Caesar Kapa\u02bbakea. The lands known as \"Kapalilua\" in Kona, Hawaii were passed from Umi-a-Liloa to his daughter Napunanahunui in perpetuity and remained in the hands of her descendants throughout the rest of Hawaiian history until the time of Kamehameha The great when they had then passed to Keeaumoku P\u0101paiahiahi from his mother K\u016bma\u02bbaik\u016b and her family which included Iwakaualii and Iama, going back eight generations. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Royalty of Hawaii (island) Category:18th-century Oceanian people ",
