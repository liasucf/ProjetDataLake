However, after the Ausgleich of 1867 Czechia belonged to the Austrian Empire while Slovakia belonged to the administratively separate Kingdom of Hungary, and between 1918 and December 31, 1992, both countries were part of Czechoslovakia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1993. These international relations are usually referred to or described as \"very good\", \"cordial\", and \"above standard\" in the media. When a Czech or Slovak president is inaugurated, very often his first international visit is to the other part of the former country. The same custom applies to newly elected prime ministers of Czechia and Slovakia. Both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union. There are around 200,000 people of Slovak descent living in Czechia and around 46,000 people of Czech descent living in Slovakia. Gust\u00e1v Slame\u010dka, a Slovak citizen, was a Minister of Transportation of Czechia from 2009 to 2010 and in his office he exclusively used the Slovak language. In December 2016 Slovak government ratified the Treaty of Cooperation on Mutual Protection of Airspace, which allows the use of Czech and Slovak military aircraft in the airspace of the other one and the possible reinforcement of one air force by its neighbour's counterpart in time of need. After the ratification from the Czech side, it came into effect in July 2017. In 2017, Andrej Babi\u0161, Slovak billionaire, had been elected the new prime minister of Czechia. ==Resident diplomatic missions== * Czechia has an embassy in Bratislava. * Slovakia has an embassy in Prague.
