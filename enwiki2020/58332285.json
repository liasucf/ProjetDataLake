    "text": "The Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) is a committee of selected members of parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the purpose of examining the reports and accounts of the public sector undertakings (PSUs) as specified in the fourth schedule of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. This committee along with the Public Accounts committee (PAC) and the Estimates committee (EC) are the three financial standing committees of the Parliament of India. The committee consists of twenty-two members, fifteen elected by Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament, and not more than seven members of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament. The members are elected every year from amongst its members of respective houses according to the principle of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. The chairperson is appointed by the Lok Sabha speaker. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister is not eligible to become a member of the committee. If a member after his election to the committee becomes a Minister, he ceases to be a member from the date of such appointment. == History == The first proposal for a separate committee had been raised by Lanka Sundaram in 1953, stating the inadequacies Public Accounts committee (PAC) and the Estimates committee (EC) with respect to public undertakings, but the then finance minister did not relent to that idea. In May 1956. Ashok Mehta also proposed that there should be a separate committee for public undertakings, however the then finance minister held the view that the PAC and the EC were sufficient to handle the work load. By 1957, the government had agreed to form a standing sub-committee of the EC on public undertakings. In 1958, the congress formed the V. K. Krishna Menon committee. which put forward a number of recommendations intended to reconcile the accountability of public undertakings to parliament while keeping their autonomy on one hand and also ensuring efficiency on the other. In the September of 1963, the then Minister of Commerce and Industry Nityanand Kanungo, put forward a motion in the Lok Sabha proposing the formation of a separate Parliamentary Committee on Public Undertakings. In pursuance of this motion the Committee on Public Undertakings was formed with effect from May 1, 1964. == Scope and Working == The functions of the Committee on Public Undertakings are * To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings specified in the fourth Schedule to the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. * To examine the reports, if any, of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on the Public Undertakings. * To examine, in the context of the autonomy and efficiency of the Public Undertakings whether the affairs of the Public Undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices. The committee from time to time takes up for examination as such any PSU or subjects related to them as they may deem fit and which are within their terms of reference. The dep or Undertaking concerned is asked to furnish necessary material relating to those subjects for information of the Members of the Committee. The Committee may from time to time appoint one or more Study Groups for carrying out detailed examination of various subjects. == Current composition == Keys: = 22 members {| class=\"wikitable\" |+15 Members from 16th Lok Sabha; tenureMay 2018-19 !Sr. No. !Portrait !Name !Constituency, state ! colspan=\"2\" |Party |- align=\"center\" |1 | |Shanta Kumar |Kangra, Himachal Pradesh | rowspan=\"9\" |BJP | bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=9| |- align=\"center\" |2 |Lkadvani |Lal Krishna Advani |Gandhinagar, Gujarat |- align=\"center\" |3 | |Ramesh Bais |Raipur, Madhya Pradesh |- align=\"center\" |4 | |Haribabu Kambhampati |Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh |- align=\"center\" |5 | |Ajay Nishad |Muzaffarpur, Bihar |- align=\"center\" |6 | |Prahlad Singh Patel |Damoh, Madhya Pradesh |- align=\"center\" |7 | |Narendra Keshav Sawaikar |South Goa, Goa |- align=\"center\" |8 | |Sushil Kumar Singh |Aurangabad, Bihar |- align=\"center\" |9 | |Rameshwar Teli |Dibrugarh, Assam |- align=\"center\" |10 | |Konakalla Narayana Rao |Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh |TDP | bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |11 | |Saugata Roy |Dum Dum, West Bengal |AITC | bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |12 | |G Hari |Arakkonam, Tamil Nadu |AIDMK | bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |13 | |Ravneet Singh |Ludhiana, Punjab |INC | bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |14 | |Vinod Kumar Boianapalli |Karimnagar, Telangana |TRS | bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |15 | |Nagendra Pradhan |Sambalpur, Odisha |BJD | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! colspan=\"6\" |Notes |- | colspan=\"6\" | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+7 Members from the Rajya Sabha !Sr. No. !Name !State Legislature ! colspan=\"2\" |Party |- align=\"center\" |1 |Samsheer Singh Manhas |Jammu & Kashmir | rowspan=\"2\" |BJP | rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"\" | |- align=\"center\" |2 |Ramvichar Netam |Chattishgarh |- align=\"center\" |3 |Mohd.
