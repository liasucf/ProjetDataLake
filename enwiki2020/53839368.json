She went to school privately and then attended school in Kolozsv\u00e1r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania). In December 1895 the newly appointed Minister of Education and Religion, Gyula Wlassics passed a law that allowed women, and Steinberger, to attend E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest to study medicine.Women can also study at Hungarian universities, 19 December 2011, Hirek.sk, Retrieved 21 April 2017 In 1900 the \"Sunday News\" announced that Steinberger had qualified as a doctor. She was the first woman to achieve this qualification in Hungary. Vilma Hugonnai, who was a Hungarian countess, had qualified as a doctor in Z\u00fcrich in 1879? but she was only allowed to practise as a doctor in Hungary in 1897.Jennifer S. Uglow, Maggy Hendry, The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography, UPNE, 1999, p. 268 After she qualified as a doctor she first studied gynecology abroad for two years. When she returned to practise in Hungary she joined the Feminists guild. Steinberger lectured and in 1902 she wrote a series of articles on The History of Doctors. She worked at the Tauffer clinic which had been founded by William Tauffer in 1888. In 1913 the law was changed so that women doctors no longer needed a male doctor to work with them. In 1928 she became the director of the National Social Insurance Institute. ==World War II== Steinberger may have been able to leave Hungary in 1938 after the Nazis annexed the country. Her case was championed in the USA with leading suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. World Peace Prize winner Rosika Schwimmer approached Catt to sign a letter in support of Eug\u00e9nia Meller and Sarolta to emigrate to the USA. Catt refused to sign the letter. She noted that she was old and the letter would remain after her death. Steinberger was the director of the National Social Insurance Institute until 1944 when the laws against Jews working prevented her from continuing her profession.Steinberger Sarolta (1875-1966) is a doctor, a feminist, Mamika, 30 May 2015, Nokert.hu, Retrieved 21 April 2017 Steinberger retired and died in Pesthidegk\u00fat near Budapest in 1965. ==References== Category:1875 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Hungarian healthcare managers Category:Hungarian women physicians Category:Hungarian gynaecologists Category:20th-century Hungarian physicians Category:19th-century Hungarian physicians Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians ",
