    "text": "The Chonos Metamorphic Complex is an accretionary complex composed of metamorphic rocks located in western Ays\u00e9n Region, Chile. The deposition of the sedimentary protoliths occurred in the Triassic and they were later metamorphosed in the Jurassic. The formation has been subdivided into a highly deformed Western belt and an Eastern belt where sedimentary structures are preserved. Fossils of Late Triassic bivalve species Monotis (Pacimonotis) aff. subcircularis and Lima sp. has been found in Chonos Metamorphic Complex, the first one in the Potranca Formation. ==References== Category:Geology of Ays\u00e9n Region Category:Metamorphic complexes Category:Lithodemic units of Chile ",
