    "text": "Grandmaster and Master are titles used to describe or address some senior or experienced martial artists. Typically these titles are honorary in nature, meaning that they do not confer rank, but rather distinguish the individual as very highly revered in their school, system, or style. == History == Asian martial arts traditionally use terms that are usually translated as \"teacher\" and the use of \"master\" was a Western invention derived from 1950s United States war veterans returning home with stories of the incredible martial feats of certain individuals and groups. Subsequently, they found their way into martial arts culture as marketing tactics to the extent that the titles are aligned to the 'elderly martial arts master' stock character. In Asian countries, such titles are more commonly reserved for religious leaders and saints. == Modern use == The use of \"master,\" \"grandmaster,\" etc. is decided within an individual art or organization. The use may be self assigned; for example having promoted a student to 'teacher' level, or may be assigned by a governing body in arts with a more formalised structure, and some do not use it at all, for historic reasons or to avoid the 'elderly master' stereotype. The modern use of Dan rankings and Black belt and Red belt in martial arts both derive from Judo where they were adopted by its founder Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d.Ranking Systems in Modern Japanese Martial Arts: Modern vs. Classical by Donn F. Draeger, Lecture on 1 April 1976. == Traditional systems == There are many terms similar or equivalent to 'master' used by various martial arts traditions. Some of these terms derive from older systems, while others are relatively modern. === Japan === Japanese martial arts commonly use Sensei (\u5148\u751f) meaning \"teacher\" or literally translated, \"born first\" or \"one who has gone before\".What is a Sensei? Neil Ohlenkamp, judoinfo.com A Sensei is a person who has knowledge and is willing to teach that knowledge to another. A Sensei assists students in ken shiki \"the pursuit of knowledge\". Several Japanese organizations, such as the Bujinkan, Kodokan (Judo), and most branches of Aikido, formally award a certificate conferring the title Shihan (\"teacher of teachers\" or \"master teacher\") to recognize high-ranking or highly distinguished instructors. , meaning \"the head family [house],\"Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary is sometimes used to refer to \"founder of a style\" because many modern s\u014dke are the first generation headmasters of their art, but most correctly refers to the current head. A s\u014dke is considered the ultimate authority within their art and has the authority to issue a menkyo kaiden certificate indicating that someone has mastered all aspects of the style. === Korea === The actual Korean word for a student's master is sonsaeng. This term is only used by the student when speaking to the instructor. The student is haksaeng.Korean Terminology Martial Arts Fitness Centers, Inc. (\ud559\uc0dd HakSaeng \u5b78\u751f) Many Korean titles are often mistakenly translated as \"grandmaster\" (\ud0dc\uc0ac\ub2d8 TaeSaNim \u592a\u5e2b\ub2d8). Sonseang-nim (\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8 SeonSaengNim \u5148\u751f\ub2d8) is a general term for a teacher of any subject as well as a respectful form of the word \"you\". Martial arts instructors (in Korea 4th Dan and above) are called Sabom-nim (\uc0ac\ubc94\ub2d8 SaBeomNim \u5e2b\u7bc4\ub2d8). === China === Various dialects of the Chinese language use different terms. \"Sifu\" is a common romanization, although the term and pronunciation are also used in other southern languages. In Mandarin Chinese, it is spelled \"shifu\" in pinyin. Using non-rhotic British English pronunciation, in Mandarin it would sound something similar to \"sure foo\". Using IPA, 'shi' is pronounced '\u0282\u0268'. The 'i' is a short vowel. Many martial arts studios incorrectly pronounce this like \"she foo\". In Cantonese, it is said as \"see foo\" (almost like \"sea food\", without the \"d\" on the end). (\u5e2b\u5085 or \u5e2b\u7236; Pinyin: sh\u012bfu, Standard pinyin: si1 fu6) a modern term for \"teacher\". The term Shifu is a combination of the characters \"teacher\" and \"father\" (\u5e2b\u7236) or a combination of the characters \"teacher\" and \"mentor\" (\u5e2b\u5085). The traditional Chinese martial arts school, or kwoon (\u9928, gu\u01cen) is an extended family headed by the Shifu. The Shifu's teacher is the \"\u5e2b\u516c honorable master\" or Shigong. Similarly the Shifu's wife is the Shimu \"teacher mother\" and the grandmaster's wife is known as: \u5e2b\u59e5 shi lao; or \u5e2b\u5a46 shi po. Male and female students who began training before you and are thus senior, are \u5e2b\u5144Shixiong \"teacher older brothers\" and \u5e2b\u59d0 Shijie \"teacher's sisters\". Women in traditional society did not have the same status as males (despite what modern movies depict). Students junior to you are your Shidi and Shimei. The pattern extends to uncles, aunts, cousins, great uncles, and so forth (see above for a complete list of relational terms). == Popular culture == Such titles may be, to some extent, aligned to the elderly martial arts master stock character in fiction. In Asian martial arts, traditional titular systems vary between nations and arts, but terms such as \"teacher\"Master vs. Sifu in Chinese Martial Arts Traditional Asian Health Center were more common than \"master.\" The modern use came from Eastern to Western society in the 1950s with stories of martial feats seen in Asia. == References == Category:Martial arts ranking ",
