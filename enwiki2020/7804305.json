    "text": "The Bishop of Killaloe ( ) is an episcopal title which takes its name after the town of Killaloe in County Clare, Ireland. In the Roman Catholic Church it remains a separate title, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other bishoprics. ==History== The Diocese of Killaloe was one of the twenty- four dioceses established at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111. The boundaries of the diocese consisted of almost all of County Clare, the northern part of County Tipperary and the western part of County Offaly. Its Irish name is Cill-da-lua (Church of Lua), so named from St Mo Lua, an abbot who lived in the late 6th century. At the Synod of Kells in March 1152, Killaloe some lost territory when the dioceses of Kilfenora, Roscrea and Scattery Island were created. Following the Reformation, there are now parallel Killaloe dioceses: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church. ; In Church of Ireland The pre-Reformation Cathedral Church of St Flannan, Killaloe continued as the Church of Ireland bishop's seat (cathedra). The Church of Ireland title was united with Kilfenora in 1752, and again with Clonfert & Kilmacduagh in 1834. Since 1976, it has been part of the united bishopric of Limerick and Killaloe. ; In the Roman Catholic Church The Roman Catholic bishop's seat is located at St Peter and St Paul Cathedral in Ennis, County Clare. The current bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe is the Most Reverend Fintan Monahan who succeeded on 25 September 2016. ==Pre- Reformation bishops== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" ! style=\"background:#fabe60;\" colspan=\"4\"|Pre-Reformation Bishops of Killaloe |- align=center ! style=\"background:#ffffec; width:9%;\"|From ! style=\"background:#ffffec; width:9%;\"|Until ! style=\"background:#ffffec; width:30%;\"|Incumbent ! style=\"background:#ffffec; width:47%;\"|Notes |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|unknown |align=center|1098 |Domnall Ua h\u00c9nna I |died 1 December 1098 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|dates unknown |Gilla P\u00e1trick Ua h\u00c9nna | |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|unknown |align=center|1131 |Domnall Ua Conaing |translated to Cashel in 1131 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|c. 1131 |align=center|c. 1137/38 |Domnall Ua Lonngarg\u00e1in |translated to Cashel c. 1137 or 1138 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|c. 1138 |align=center|1161 |Tadg Ua Lonngarg\u00e1in |died in office |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|c. 1161 |align=center|1164 |Donnchad mac Diarmata Ua Briain |died in office |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|bef. 1179 |align=center|1194 |Constant\u00edn mac Toirrdelbaig Ua Briain |died in office |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1194 |align=center|1195 |Diarmait Ua Conaing |died in office |- style=\"vertical- align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|bef. 1201 |align=center|1216 |Conchobhar Ua h-\u00c9nna |died in office; also known as Cornelius |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1216 |align=center|unknown |Domnall Ua h-\u00c9nna II |elected 1216; confirmed by Pope Honorius III 1219; consecrated 1221; also known as Donatus |- style=\"vertical- align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1217 |align=center|1221/26 |Robert Travers |elected before 14 January 1217; consecrated after 14 January 1217; deprived 1221, and again May 1226 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1231 |align=center|1252 |Domnall \u00d3 Cenn\u00e9itig |elected before 1231; died before 1252; also known as Donatus |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1253 |align=center|1267 |\u00cds\u00f3c \u00d3 Cormac\u00e1in |elected before 5 April 1253; appointed and consecration 23 June 1253; resigned before 10 November 1267; also known as Isaac |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1268 |align=center|1281 |Mathgamain \u00d3 h-\u00d3c\u00e1in |elected before 20 March 1268; died 12 August 1281; also known as Matthaeus |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1281 |align=center|1298 |Mauricius \u00d3 h-\u00d3c\u00e1in |elected 23 November 1281; died before October 1298 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1299 |align=center|1317 |David Mac Mathghamna |elected 7 January 1299; consecrated May 1299; died 9 February 1317; also known as David Mac Mahon |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1317 |align=center|1322 |Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Cormac\u00e1in I |elected before 2 July 1317; died 31 July 1322 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1323 |align=center|c. 1325 |Brian \u00d3 Coscraig |elected before 1 August 1323; died c. 1325; also known as Benedictus |- style=\"vertical- align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|1326 |align=center|1342 |David Mac Briain |elected before May 1326; appointed 25 May 1326; died 12 December 1342; also known as 'David of Emly' |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\" |align=center|?
