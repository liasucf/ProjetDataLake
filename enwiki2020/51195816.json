Malalasekera ==Character== Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha is the god who receives messages from the Four Heavenly Kings and their ministers regarding the deeds done in the human world. He would pass information on to M\u0101tali, who in turn informed the king of Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba, \u015aakra. He is also king among the gandharvas, a status granted by \u015aakra. His lover is the female gandharva Bhadr\u0101 S\u016bryavarcas\u0101 (Sanskrit; Pali: Bhadd\u0101 Suriyavaccas\u0101). His favorite instrument is the Beluvapanduv\u012bn\u0101, a stringed instrument that originally belonged to Mara. In Mahayana sources, this is described as a lute made of beryl or lapis lazuli (Ch: \u7409\u7483\u7434 or \u7460\u7483\u5bf6\u88dd\u7b9c\u7bcc). ==Literature== ===Sakkapa\u00f1ha Sutta/\u015aakraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra=== Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha makes his most notable appearance in the Sutra of the Questions of \u015aakra; the Sakkapa\u00f1ha Sutta in the Pali Canon and the \u015aakraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra (\u5e1d\u91cb\u6240\u554f\u7d93) in the Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka; where his role as interlocutor becomes apparent. \u015aakra, on wishing to see the Buddha appeared with a retinue of gods in the human world above Mount Vediyaka. The light created by their glory was noticed by the residents of the local village, who assumed that the mountain had caught on fire. \u015aakra persuaded Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha to charm the Buddha out of his meditation in order to gain his attention. Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha obliged and went to the cave in which the Buddha was staying. He addressed him with a song about the Three Jewels and romantic love. ====Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha\u2019s Song==== \u201cMy lady Suriyavaccas\u0101, oh my Sunshine\u2014 I pay homage to your father Timbaru, through whom was born a lady so fine, to fill me with a joy I never knew. As sweet as a breeze to one who\u2019s sweating, or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink, so dear is your shining beauty to me, just like the teaching is to all the saints! Like a cure when you\u2019re struck by fever dire, or food to ease the hunger pain, come on, darling, please put out my fire, quench me like water on a flame. As elephants burning in the heat of summer, sink down in a lotus pond to rest, so cool, full of petals and of pollen\u2014 that\u2019s how I would plunge into your breast. Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season, beating off the pricks of lance and pikes\u2014 I just don\u2019t understand what is the reason I\u2019m so crazy for your shapely thighs! For you, my heart is full of passion, I\u2019m in an altered state of mind. There is no going back, I\u2019m just not able, I\u2019m like a fish that\u2019s hooked up on the line. Come on, my darling, hold me, fair of thighs! Embrace me, with your so bashful eyes! Take me in your arms, my lovely lady, that\u2019s all I\u2019d ever want or could desire. Ah, then my desire was such a small thing, my sweet, with your curling wavy hair; now, like to arahants an offering, it\u2019s grown so very much from there. Whatever the merit I have forged by giving to such perfected beings\u2014 may that, my altogether gorgeous, ripen in togetherness with you. Whatever the merit I have forged in this wide open land, may that, my altogether gorgeous, ripen in togetherness with you. Absorbed, the Sakyan meditates, unified, alert, and mindful, the sage aims right at the deathless state\u2014 like me, oh my Sunshine, aiming for you! And just like the sage would be rejoicing, were he to awaken to the truth, so I\u2019d be rejoicing, lady, were I to end up as one with you. If Sakka were to grant me just one wish, as Lord of the holy Thirty- Three, my darling, you\u2019re the only one I\u2019d wish for, so strong is the love I hold for you. Like a freshly blossoming sal tree is your father, my lady so wise. I pay homage to him, bowing down humbly, to he whose daughter is of such a kind.\u201d ====The Buddha's response==== The Buddha praised Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha for his ability to harmonize his voice and instrument and asked him when he composed the song. Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha relayed the story of when he fell in love with the goddess Bhadd\u0101 Suriyavaccas\u0101 shortly after the Buddha's enlightenment. ===Other=== Within Pali literature, Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha is seen in the Pa\u00f1casikha Sutta where he visits the Buddha and asks him why some beings attain arhatship in their present lives while others do not. The Bil\u0101rakosiya J\u0101taka states that in a past life, Ananda held the office of Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha. He also appears in Sanskrit literature such as the Avad\u0101na\u015bataka. He is also counted among deities in Mahayana texts such as the Sam\u0101dhir\u0101ja S\u016btra, the D\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra and the Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da S\u016btra. ==See also== *Gandharva *Hermes - a Greek god who shares some similarities with Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha ==References== Category:Buddhist gods Category:Gandharvas ",
