It houses 89 departments spread over 6 campuses (2 rural and 4 urban) covering 275 acres of land. ==History== Statue of alt= The university has its origins in the Baroda College, established in 1881 by Baroda State. The main building, which houses the Faculty of Arts, was designed by Robert Fellowes Chisholm in Indo-Saracenic architecture style, in a fusion of Indian and Byzantine arches and domes in brick and polychromed stone. The main dome on the convocation hall was modelled after the great dome of the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur. Pratap Singh Gaekwad of Baroda (1908\u20131968) (the last Maharaja of the erstwhile Baroda State) founded the university in 1949 on the wishes of his grandfather, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III (1863\u20131939), and settled the \"Sir Sayajirao Diamond Jubilee and Memorial Trust\" which exists to date, catering to the education and other needs of the people of the former Baroda State. == Faculties == ===Faculty of Science=== The old Baroda College founded in 1881 consisted of Arts and Science sections. The Faculty of Science started its independent existence in March 1951 with Dr C.S. Patel as its first dean. The Old Building which houses the Faculty of Science at present was completed in about 1934 in the reign of Sayajirao Gaekwad III. It is conspicuous by its small copper dome and is flanked on the west by the building of Faculty of Education and Psychology and on the east by the majestic building of the Old Baroda College, now the Faculty of Arts.http://www.msubaroda.ac.in/faculty.php?action=home&fac;_id=3 ====Department of Physics==== As a premier centre for Physics learning in India, the department, established in 1949, offers U.G., P.G. and PhD programme and is a sponsored department of Department Of Science and Technology, Government of India under FIST programme.
