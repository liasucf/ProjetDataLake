    "text": "The 2017 Ayorou attack occurred on 21 October 2017 when armed militants attacked a Nigerien military outpost in the village of Ayorou in southwestern Niger, killing 13 gendarmes. Occurring just weeks after a similar attack in the area killed four American and four Nigerien troops, the attack was carried out by gunmen who crossed the porous border from Mali. At dawn, militants in 4-5 vehicles and motorcycles and armed with machine guns and rocket launchers attacked paramilitary policemen in Ayorou, a small town on the banks of the Niger River 200 kilometers (125 mi) northwest of Niamey. Thirteen gendarmes were killed and five others were wounded. At least one of the attackers was killed as well. The attackers fled after police reinforcements arrived and pursued them to the border. A similar raid was carried out on the same outpost the previous May. In a statement released by the U.S. embassy, the United States strongly condemned the attack and offered condolences to the families of the victims. ==See also== * Tongo Tongo ambush ==References== Category:2017 in Niger Category:Attacks in 2017 Category:October 2017 crimes Category:October 2017 events in Africa Category:Terrorist incidents in Niger Category:Tillab\u00e9ri Region Category:Terrorist incidents in Africa in 2017 ",
