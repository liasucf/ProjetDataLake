    "text": "Appleton City Hall is a historic municipal building in Appleton, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1895 as one of the few monumental 19th-century buildings in rural western Minnesota. It initially housed Appleton's government offices, fire department, and jail on the ground floor and an auditorium on the upper floor. The city hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for supposedly being an example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture and for its long service as a local government and community center. However other sources describe the building's style less specifically as Romanesque Revival, and its municipal services relocated to other facilities in 1976. ==See also== * List of city and town halls in the United States * National Register of Historic Places listings in Swift County, Minnesota ==References== Category:1895 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Swift County, Minnesota Category:City and town halls on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Former seats of local government Category:Government buildings completed in 1895 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Swift County, Minnesota Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Minnesota ",
