He is most noted for creating the ballet, La fille mal gard\u00e9e, one of the most enduring and popular works of the ballet repertoire. Dauberval was trained at the school of the Paris Op\u00e9ra where he studied under the great Jean-Georges Noverre. He was appointed premier danseur of the ballet of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique in 1763, and, in 1771, he was named ballet master. From 1781 until 1783, he was engaged as Ma\u00eetre de Ballet to the Acad\u00e9mie, and in 1783-84 season in London's King's Theatre.
