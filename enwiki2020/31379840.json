    "text": "A person's waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), also called waist-to-stature ratio (WSR), is defined as their waist circumference divided by their height, both measured in the same units. The WHtR is a measure of the distribution of body fat. Higher values of WHtR indicate higher risk of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases; it is correlated with abdominal obesity. A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that WHtR is a much better measure of the risk of heart attack, stroke or death than the more widely used body mass index. However, a 2011 study that followed 60,000 participants for up to 13 years found that waist\u2013hip ratio (when adjusted for BMI) was a better predictor of ischemic heart disease mortality than WHtR. Conversely, WHtR was not a predictor for new-onset diabetes melitus in at least one study. A WHtR of over 0.5 is critical and signifies an increased risk; a 2010 systematic review of published studies concluded that \"WHtR may be advantageous because it avoids the need for age-, sex- and ethnic-specific boundary values\". For people under 40 the critical value is 0.5, for people aged 40\u201350 the critical value is between 0.5 and 0.6, and for people over 50 the critical values start at 0.6. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
