    "text": "Beautiful Vampire is a 2018 South Korean fantasy film which is a re-release of the oksusu's web series with more cuts. It was released on October 8, 2018. ==Plot== Ran is a 500-year-old vampire who chooses to live an ordinary life among human beings despite having powers such as speed. She runs a make-up shop in the neighborhood of Mangwon in Seoul, but her life is still different compared to other women as she does not age and needs animal blood to survive. Things change when Lee So-nyeon, the new landlord's son, falls in love with Ran: her appetite for human blood comes back. ==Cast== * Jung Yeon-joo as Ran * Song Kang as Lee So-nyeon * Park Jun-myun as Kang Mool-joo * Lee Yong-nyeo as Ok-bun ==Release== The film premiered at the 2018 Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival in the category Korean Fantastic: Features (Non- Competition) on July 13, 2018. ==Critical reception== Pierce Conran of Screen Anarchy gave the following review: \"Despite its appealing cocktail of quirk and genre conventions, Beautiful Vampire never quite goes beyond its modest ambitions as a light combination of popular genre conventions and lowbrow dramedy. Even at a svelte 72 minutes, it doesn't take long for the undemanding story and simplistic side characters to fall into repetitive patterns.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean fantasy films Category:South Korean romance films Category:South Korean independent films Category:Korean-language films Category:Vampires in film Category:Films set in Seoul ",
