An was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962 by the South Korean government, the most prestigious civil decoration in the Republic of Korea, for his efforts for Korean independence. Doosan Encyclopedia ==Biography== ===Early accounts=== An's parents An was born on 2 September 1879, in Haeju, Hwanghae- do, the first son of An Tae-hun (\uc548\ud0dc\ud6c8; \u5b89\u6cf0\u52f3) and Jo Maria (Jo Seong-nyeo \uc870\uc131\ub140; \u8d99\u59d3\u5973), of the family of the Sunheung-An (\uc21c\ud765\uc548\uc528; \u9806\u8208\u5b89\u6c0f) lineage. His childhood name was (\uc548\uc751\uce60; \u5b89\u61c9\u4e03; ). As a boy, he learned Chinese literature and Western sciences, but was more interested in martial arts and marksmanship. Kim Gu (\uae40\uad6c; \u91d1\u4e5d), future leader of the Korean independence movement who had taken refuge in An Tae-hun's house at the time, wrote that young An Jung-geun was an excellent marksman, liked to read books, and had strong charisma.Kim, G. (1928/1997, p.48) French priest Wilhelm At the age of 16, An entered the Catholic Church with his father, where he received his baptismal name \"Thomas\" (\ud1a0\ub9c8\uc2a4), and learned French. While fleeing from the Japanese, An took refuge with a French priest of the Catholic Church in Korea named Wilhelm (Korean name, Hong Seok-gu; \ud64d\uc11d\uad6c; \u6d2a\u932b\u4e5d) who baptized and hid him in his church for several months. The priest encouraged An to read the Bible and had a series of discussions with him. He maintained his belief in Catholicism until his death, going to the point of even asking his son to become a priest in his last letter to his wife. At the age of 25, he started a coal business, but devoted himself to education of Korean people after the Eulsa Treaty by establishing private schools in northwestern regions of Korea. He also participated in the National Debt Repayment Movement. In 1907 he exiled himself to Vladivostok to join in with the armed resistance against the Japanese colonial rulers, where he learnt fluent Russian. He was appointed a lieutenant general of an armed Korean resistance group and led several attacks against Japanese forces before his eventual defeat. ===Assassination of It\u014d Hirobumi=== An Jung-geun in 1906 Ito (second on the left) before being gunned down by An Jung-geun In October 1909, An passed the Imperial Japanese guards at the Harbin Railway Station. It\u014d Hirobumi had come back from negotiating with the Russian representative on the train. An shot It\u014d three times with an FN M1900 pistol on the railway platform. He also shot Kawagami Toshihiko (\u5ddd\u4e0a\u4fca\u5f66), the Japanese Consul General, Morita Jir\u014d (\u68ee\u6cf0\u4e8c\u90de), a Secretary of Imperial Household Agency, and Tanaka Seitar\u014d (\u7530\u4e2d\u6df8\u592a\u90de), an executive of South Manchuria Railway, who were seriously injured. After the shooting, An yelled out for Korean independence in Russian, stating \"\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u044f! \u0423\u0440\u0430!\" (Korea! Hooray!), and waving the Korean flag. Afterwards, An was arrested by Russian guards who held him for two days before turning him over to Japanese colonial authorities. When he heard the news that It\u014d had died, he made the sign of the cross in gratitude. An was quoted as saying, \"I have ventured to commit a serious crime, offering my life for my country. This is the behavior of a noble-minded patriot.\" Wilhelm gave last rites to An, ignoring the bishop of Korea's order not to. An insisted that the captors call him by his baptismal name, Thomas. In court, An claimed to be a lieutenant general of the Korean resistance army and demanded to be treated as a prisoner of war and not a suspected criminal. He insisted he did nothing wrong, reciting a list of 15 execution-worthy offenses he believed It\u014d had committed.Kang.(2007, p.131) An mistakenly believed It\u014d had ordered the assassination of Empress Myeongseong, an order which is attributed to Miura Gor\u014d, although Miura Gor\u014d did send a report to It\u014d after the execution. ===Imprisonment and death=== An's Japanese captors showed sympathy to him. He recorded in his autobiography that the public prosecutor, Mizobuchi Takao, exclaimed \"From what you have told me, it is clear that you are a righteous man of East Asia. I can't believe a sentence of death will be imposed on a righteous man. There's nothing to worry about.\" He was also given New Year's delicacies and his calligraphy was highly admired and requested. After six trials, An was sentenced to death by the Japanese colonial court in Ryojun (Port Arthur). An was angered at the sentence, though he expected it. He had hoped to be viewed as a prisoner of war instead of an assassin. On the same day of sentencing at two o'clock in the afternoon, his two brothers Jeong-geun and Gong-geun met with him to deliver their mother's message, \"Your death is for the sake of your country, and don't ask for your life in a cowardly manner. Your brave death for justice is a final filial regards to your mother.\" Judge Hirashi, who presided over An's trial, had promised An that a stay of execution for at least a few months would be granted, but Tokyo ordered prompt action. Before his execution, An made two final requests: that the wardens help him finish his essay, \"On Peace in East Asia\", and for a set of white silk Korean clothes to die in. The warden granted the second request and resigned shortly afterwards. An requested to be executed as a prisoner of war, by firing squad. But instead it was ordered that he should be hanged as a common criminal. The execution took place in Ryojun, on 26 March 1910. His grave in Lu Shun has not been found.\u6885\u6cc9\u91ce\u9332 \u6f22\u6587 ( 3 ) ==Views== Some historians hold that It\u014d's death resulted in the acceleration of the final stage of the colonization process, but the claim has been disputed by some. 2010 Nocut News article According to Donald Keene, author of Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912, An Jung-Geun was an admirer of Emperor Meiji of Imperial Japan. One of the 15 charges An leveled against It\u014d was that he had deceived the Emperor of Japan, whom An felt desired peace in East Asia and Korean independence. An requested that Meiji be informed of his reasons for his execution of It\u014d in the hopes that if Meiji understood his reasons, the emperor would realize how mistaken It\u014d's policies were and would rejoice. An also felt sure that most Japanese felt similar hatred for It\u014d, an opinion he formed from talking with Japanese prisoners in Korea. While An was staying in the prison and on the trial, many Japanese prison guards, lawyers and even prosecutors were inspired by An.\"Research notes of Ippei Wakabayashi\" ==Legacy== Taegukgi by Ahn Jung-geun longing for the Independence of Korea \"\u4e00\u65e5\u4e0d\u8b80\u66f8\u53e3\u4e2d\u751f\u834a\u68d8\" means \"Unless reading everyday, thorns grow in the mouth.\" The assassination of It\u014d by An was praised by Koreans and many Chinese as well, who were struggling against Japanese invasion at the time. Well-known Chinese political leaders such as Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen, and Liang Qichao wrote poems acclaiming An. 2009 Joongang Ilbo Article In the 2010 An Jung-Geun Symposium in Korea, Wada Haruki (\u548c\u7530\u6625\u6a39), an activist who once worked at Tokyo University, evaluated An by quoting It\u014d Yukio (\u4f0a\u85e4\u4e4b\u96c4), a fellow history scholar in Kyoto University. 2010 Kyunghyang News Article In his text published in 2009, It\u014d Yukio claims that the reign by It\u014d Hirobumi resulted in strong resistance from Koreans as it was considered the first step for annexation of Korea due to the cultural differences, and that An is not to be blamed even if he assassinated It\u014d without understanding It\u014d's ideology (2009, It\u014d). On 26 March 2010, a nationwide centenary tribute to An was held in South Korea, including a ceremony led by the Prime Minister Chung Un-Chan and tribute concerts. === Ancestry === An's family produced many other Korean independence activists. An's cousin An Myeong-Geun (\uc548\uba85\uadfc; \u5b89\u660e\u6839) attempted to assassinate Terauchi Masatake, the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea (\uc870\uc120\ucd1d\ub3c5; \u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763) who executed the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910. He failed, however, and was imprisoned for 15 years; he died in 1926. An's brothers Ahn Jeong-Geun (\uc548\uc815\uadfc; \u5b89\u5b9a\u6839) and Ahn Gong-Geun (\uc548\uacf5\uadfc; \u5b89\u606d\u6839), as well as An's cousin Ahn Gyeong- Geun (\uc548\uacbd\uadfc; \u5b89\u656c\u6839) and nephew Ahn Woo-Saeng (\uc548\uc6b0\uc0dd; \u5b89\u5076\u751f), joined the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, China, which led by Kim Gu, and fought against Japan. Ahn Chun-Saeng (\uc548\ucd98\uc0dd; \u5b89\u6625\u751f), another nephew of An's, joined the National Revolutionary Army of China, participated in battles against Japanese forces at Shanghai, and joined the Korean Liberation Army in 1940. Later, he became a lieutenant general of the Republic of Korea Army and a member of the National Assembly of South Korea. === Pan-Asianism === An strongly believed in the union of the three great countries in East Asia, China, Korea, and Japan in order to counter and fight off the \"White Peril\", namely, Western countries that controlled parts of Asia, and restore East Asian independence. He followed the progress of Japan during the Russo- Japanese War and claimed that he and his compatriots were delighted at hearing of the defeat of one of the agents of the White Peril, but were disappointed that the war ended before Russia was totally subjugated. An felt that with the death of It\u014d, Japan and Korea could become friends because of the many traditions that they shared. He hoped that this friendship, along with China, would become a model for the world to follow. His thoughts on Pan-Asianism were stated in his essay, \"On Peace in East Asia\" (\u6771\u6d0b\u5e73\u548c\u8ad6; \ub3d9\uc591\ud3c9\ud654\ub860) that he worked on and left unfinished before his execution.\uc548\uc911\uadfc \uc758\uc0ac\uc758 <\ub3d9\uc591\ud3c9\ud654\ub860> In this work, An recommends the organization of combined armed forces and the issue of joint banknotes among Korea, Japan, and China. Sasagawa Norikatsu (\u7b39\u5ddd\u7d00\u52dd), a Professor of Law at Meiji University, highly praises An's idea as an equivalent of the European Union and a concept that preceded the concept of United Nations by 10 years. 2010 Segye Ilbo article === Calligraphic works === An is highly renowned for calligraphy works. While he was in prison, many prison guards such as Chiba Toshichi (\u5343\u8449\u5341\u4e03) who respected him, made requests to An for calligraphy works. He left many calligraphy works which were written in the jail of Lushun although he hadn't studied calligraphy formally. He would leave on his calligraphy works a signature of \"\u5927\u97d3\u570b\u4eba\" (Great Korean) and a handprint of his left hand that was missing the last joint of the ring finger, which he had cut off with his comrades in 1909 as a pledge to kill It\u014d. Some of the works were designated as Treasure No. 569 of the Republic of Korea in 1972.An Jung Geun calligraphy, Treasure No. 569 One of his famous works is \"\u4e00\u65e5\u4e0d\u8b80\u66f8\u53e3\u4e2d\u751f\u834a\u68d8\" (\uc77c\uc77c\ubd80\ub3c5\uc11c \uad6c\uc911\uc0dd\ud615\uadf9; Unless one reads every day, thorns grow in the mouth), a quote from the Analects of Confucius. ===Memorial Halls=== Memorial halls for An were erected in Seoul in 1970 by the South Korean government and in Harbin by the Chinese government in 2006. 2009 Asian Business Article South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised the idea of erecting a monument for An while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. Thus another memorial hall honoring An Jung-Geun was opened on Sunday, 19 January 2014 in Harbin. The hall, a 200-square meter room, features photos and memorabilia. Annual activities in memorial of An are held in L\u00fcshun, where he was imprisoned and executed. According to local sources in China dated on 22 March 2017, the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Hall located at Harbin Railway Station was recently relocated to a Korean art museum in Harbin City amid China's retaliation over South Korea's deployment of the U.S. THAAD antimissile system. The Memorial Hall has since been reopened in the Harbin Railway Station after renovation work. == Controversies == Historically, the Japanese government has generally deemed An Jung-geun as a terrorist and criminal, while South Korea has upheld An as a national hero. In January 2014, Yoshihide Suga, a Japanese government spokesman, described the Harbin memorial hall honoring An in China as \"not conducive to building peace and stability\" between East Asian countries. China, on the other hand has declared that Ahn was a \"famous anti-Japanese high-minded person\" while South Korea's foreign ministry stated An was a \"highly respected figure.\" In February 2017, South Korean police were criticized for using a picture of An in posters put up in the city of Incheon. The poster warned of terrorism, and many South Korean citizens online criticized the police, asking \"if it was meant to imply if An was a terrorist\". A police officer in the Korea Times apologized and clarified that there was no intention to associate An with terrorism, and all posters were taken down. ==In popular culture== The North Korean film An Jung Gun Shoots It\u014d Hirobumi is a dramatized story of the event.DVD in North Korea Books The South Korean film Thomas An Jung-geun (\ud1a0\ub9c8\uc2a4 \uc548\uc911\uadfc) is another dramatized story of the event. Released on September 10, 2004, it is directed by Seo Se-won. An Jung-Geun is played by actor Yu Oh-seong and It\u014d Hirobumi is played by Yoon Joo-sang. A Chinese-South Korean co-production, \"The Age of Heroes,\" is being planned as a Korean Drama for 2019. \u201cThe Age of Heroes\u201d is planned to be 24 episodes long and entirely pre-produced with an impressive budget of 30 billion won. Filming will begin by the end of 2018 with locations in South Korea, China, and North Korea. ==See also== * Korean independence movement * List of Korea-related topics * Lee Bong-chang * Yun Bong-gil ==References== * Chung, K.
