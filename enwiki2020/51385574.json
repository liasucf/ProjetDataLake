He spent his youth career at Celta de Vigo and C\u00e1diz CF, representing the former for nine years. Mart\u00ednez retired from professional football at the age of 20, and started his coaching career with CD Imperio de Albolote's youth categories, while also playing for their first team. In 2004, he moved to Arenas CD, being initially in charge of the youth setup. An assistant manager in the 2005\u201306 campaign, Mart\u00ednez was appointed manager of the first team in July 2006, in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. The following year he was named Motril CF manager, and remained in charge for two years. In October 2009 Mart\u00ednez moved to Sevilla FC, immediately joining the backroom staff. He was in charge of the club's C-team the following season, and subsequently managed the Juvenil squad. On 22 May 2012, Mart\u00ednez was named assistant at the first team, replacing Javi Navarro. On 13 June 2014, he was appointed at the helm of the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and managed to achieve promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in 2016. After avoiding relegation with the reserve side, Mart\u00ednez opted not to renew his contract, and was appointed in charge of CA Osasuna on 14 June 2017. The following 7 June, he left the club after failing to qualify for the play-offs. On 14 June 2018, Mart\u00ednez was named Granada CF manager, and achieved promotion to La Liga at the end of the season.
