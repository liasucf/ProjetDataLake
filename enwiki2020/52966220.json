Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 24, 2019Regina Carter: album entry, accessed January 24, 2019 == Reception == In the review on Allmusic, Richard S. Ginell stated \"this session has plenty of life and wit; indeed, the sounds of the violin and piano go together as naturally in jazz as in the classical field (must be the resonating strings and wood factors that these instruments share). Carter clearly provides a lot of the spark with her ability to swing, often juxtaposed with classical poise straight from the conservatory, prodding the congenitally professional Barron into occasionally taking some chances\". In JazzTimes Doug Ramsey wrote \"The cohesion and joy of this duo\u2019s music- making is consistent from beginning to end. Freefall is as close to flawless as any album I have heard this year\".Ramsey, D.
