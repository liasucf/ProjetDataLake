It is located to the northeast of the small crater Dawes, and to the west of the Montes Taurus range. To the east-northeast of this position is the landing site of the Apollo 17 mission, in the Taurus\u2013Littrow valley. Osiris and nearby Isis are located on conical uprises situated along a rille and are interpreted as small volcanic cones.Head, James W., 1975. Morphology of Pyroclastic Lunar Volcanic Deposits: Implications for Eruption Conditions and Localized Sources of Volatiles. Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, volume 6, page 349-351. Osiris is the biggest of 5 cones on this rille. The name of the crater was approved by the IAU in 1976, and refers to an Egyptian male given name.Osiris, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) ==References== * * * * * * * ==External links== * Osiris at The Moon Wiki * LTO-42C3 Dawes -- L&PI; topographic map of area.
