    "text": "Laal Kabootar () is a 2019 Pakistani action crime thriller film directed by Kamal Khan, produced by Hania Chima and Kamil Chima, and written by Ali Abbas Naqvi. Taha Malik is the music director while Danial Hyatt, son of Rohail Hyatt, provides the background score.\"'Laal Kabootar' to hit theaters across Pakistan Friday\" (21 March 2019), Geo News. Retrieved 24 March 2019.\"Star- studded twin premieres for \u2018Laal Kabootar\u2019 held\" (22 March 2019), Daily Times. Retrieved 24 March 2019. The film features Ahmed Ali Akbar, Mansha Pasha, Rashid Farooqui, Raza Gillani, Syed Mohammad Ahmed, and Ali Kazmi. The film was released on 22 March 2019. Laal Kabootar's TV Premier was on 31 August 2019 on Geo Entertainment. It was Pakistan's official entry for 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. == Plot == Laal Kabootar starts off slowly but picks up pace brilliantly. When Alia\u2019s (Mansha Pasha) husband, Noman Malik (Ali Kazmi), is murdered in a brutal target killing in Karachi, she seeks answers and revenge. Up against a lazy justice system, as well as a social structure that isn\u2019t kind to single women, she pushes ahead in fury. Finally, she comes across Adeel (Ahmed Ali), a cab driver with his own set of troubles. Adeel\u2019s dreams of going to Dubai aren\u2019t materializing, even though he indulges in petty crimes. After a chance encounter with Alia, he offers to find out vital information for her, in return for a hefty sum of money. The story isn\u2019t unlike that of many other crime films, and neatly brings together the lives of police officers, businessmen, petty thieves and murderers. However, the star of the film is Inspector Ibrahim (Rashid Farooqui), who easily switches between a loving family man and a corrupt police officer. When he tortures an informant, you curse him, but when he lets his daughter do his makeup, you absolutely fall in love with him. A police officer looks over a gate, shouting \u2018Oye Hello\u2019 at some criminals, and allowing them to run away. An inspector tries to wake up his wife, by pulling up her eyelids, and you laugh along as they both chuckle. Just when you think the film lacks emotional depth, you are offered the raw sadness of parents mourning their dead child, or the anxiety of a young man calming down his senile father. Meanwhile, deep in the winding lanes of a dense Karachi neighbourhood, Adeel (Ahmed Ali Akbar) tends to his aging father, drives a little red cab to make ends meet, commits petty theft and dreams of saving enough money to escape to the promised land: Dubai. Aliya and Adeel's individual scheming and planning throws them together unexpectedly. Adeel offers to help Aliya find her husband's murderer. In exchange, she'll give him enough money to flee to the UAE. Sounds simple enough... but neither of them realise they're in over their heads. What follows is threats and torment and fear, gunfights and death, difficult choices and the potential unmasking of a corrupt empire. == Cast == *Ahmed Ali Akbar as Adeel Alam *Ali Kazmi as Noman Malik *Mansha Pasha as Aaliyah Malik *Syed Mohammad Ahmed *Rashid Farooqui as Inspector Ibrahim *Mojiz Hasan *Saleem Meraj *Syed Arsalan *Hammad Sidiq *Ishtiaq Omar *Kaleem Ghour *Faiza Gillani == Production == === Filming === Laal Kabootar was filmed in Karachi.
