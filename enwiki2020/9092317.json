As described in detail in an editorial note, the idea of a treasure hunting story was prompted by a wish on the part of Manx politicians to promote tourism to the Isle of Man. Christie wrote a short story which was serialised in the Daily Dispatch in five instalments on 23, 24, 26, 27 and 28 May 1930. The story gave the clues to the location of four snuffboxes hidden on the island, each of which contained a voucher for \u00a3100 \u2013 a considerable sum in 1930. Island residents were barred from taking part. To further promote the hunt, the story was then published in a promotional booklet entitled June in Douglas which was distributed at guesthouses and other tourist spots. Although a quarter of a million copies of this booklet were printed, only one is known to have survived.Announcement of publication of \"Manx Gold\", twbooks.co.uk; accessed 6 August 2015. * Within a Wall: First published in issue 324 of the Royal Magazine in October 1925. * The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest: First published in issue 493 of the Strand Magazine in January 1932.
