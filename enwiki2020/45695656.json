Only mutual friends can set up communication in one circle, which indicates the high reciprocity and exclusivity among acquaintances. Moments accords with the Chinese-style interpersonal structure, which was described as the ripples generating circle by circle when a stone is thrown into water and everyone is in the center of a series of circles. The ties get weaker as the circles spread further.Fei,X.T. (1948) Xiangtu Zhongguo\u9109\u571f\u4e2d\u570b Moments mainly consolidates strong ties and is supplemented with weak ties, and it functions in three hierarchies of a pyramid structure, from bottom to top.Nie,L., Fu CX.,& Cheng D.(2013) Moments of WeChat: the virtual community from social network perspective\u5fae\u4fe1\u670b\u53cb\u5708\uff1a\u793e\u4f1a\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u865a\u62df\u793e\u533a Journalism Review\u65b0\u805e\u8a18\u8005 Vol.5 ===The culture of sharing and \u201clike\u201d=== The \u201csharing\u201d function in Moments is of simple operation that it only needs a click on a button.

The culture of \u201clike\u201d in Moments suggests a means of pursuing and highlighting one\u2019s existence and indicates the rule of interaction among members in a circle. A \u201clike\u201d conveys a strong emotional expression of one\u2019s stand and has a social and dissemination function to some extent.Wei BT. & Wang S.

People can decide in every single sharing that who can see while others not, and all these will be kept to themselves. Grouping provides some people with the opportunity of living in parallel space-time, the right of gaining admiration and the possibility of escapism.What is Moments? The greatest function is grouping.\u670b\u53cb\u5708\u662f\u4e2a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5708\uff1f\u6700\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5c31\u662f\u5206\u7ec4 News.PEdaily 2014-11-13 ==Positive Impacts== *Modern Instant Messaging systems in respect to privacy. All the comments and likes on a certain post could only be seen by users\u2019 mutual friends. The personal originally sharing cannot be shared when directed to other groups of people. *Gave rise to new popular forms of information spreading for commercial, educational or other purposes. Since Moments is a more private space for information sharing, the messages on Moments are generally considered to be more credible.Xiang,Y. Chang,D. Chen,B.W. (2013) A Smart University Campus Information Dissemination Framework Based on WeChat Platform *Helps users keep in touch with acquaintances, and to some extent strengthens the users\u2019s relationships with acquaintances. *Low- cost and low-carbon way of recording personal lives. The installation of the application WeChat itself and the usage of basic functions including Moments is free. The potential space of storing posts is infinite, allowing for a large amount to be shared and saved over time. *Effective way of sharing personal feelings among groups of people. As long as the user has a device connected to the Internet, they can upload. Meanwhile, other users can check their friends\u2019 posts at any time.Zheng, Z.L. Zhang, Q.P,Wang,B. (2014) Research on Model of Online Knowledge Sharing for CoPS R&D; Team based on WeChat Platform ==Negative Impacts== *Spreading of false informationFalse Information in Moments is Illegal,Relevant Polices will be made.(People Net,August 7,2014) As a social platform, Moments contains risks of misinformation, for example, \"Ten secrets about Bo Xilai\", \"drinking milk leads to cancer\". False information also spreads rapidly through reposts and sharing websites. Since most Moments friends are acquaintances, messages delivered by them can seem more convincing. Such false information misleads the public as well as causes negative social influence, even panic. *Viral MarketingChen,H.M.(2006) Discussion about Viral Marketing Marketing becomes a problem because some users operate online stores by using their Wechat accounts. To advertise goods, viral marketing methods including utilizing acquaintances network and posting advertisements several times a day in Moments are widely used.Liang,Y.(2014) Introduction to the WeChat Marketing Advantages and Development Prospects However, the existence of commercial advertising impacts the pureness of Moments and annoy most of users. To reduce advertisements, users have to block their friend-traders, though which will hurt their relations. Also, due to the absence of relevant policies, quality and service of those goods can hardly be guaranteed. *Barrage of information Except false information and advertisements, inspirational articles and Chicken Soup for the Soul(\u5fc3\u9748\u96de\u6e6f) style stories elicit repugnance as well. It is because that almost all those stories follow similar ideal patterns and express similar thoughts. At first, such stories can inspire readers, but after a while, it is proved as nothing but placebo. Furthermore, some of them even make up experience or dicta of great men to persuade others to believe in their themes. ==See also== * Qzone * Instagram * Facebook * Twitter * Sina Weibo ==External links== * WeChat Moments: Share what you love * WeChat Sight: Point, Shoot, Share ==References== Category:Smartphones Category:Social networking services ",
