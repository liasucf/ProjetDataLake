    "text": "Khaali Peeli is a 2020 Indian Hindi-language masala film directed by Maqbool Khan and jointly produced by Ali Abbas Zafar, Zee Studios, Himanshu Kishan Mehra. The films stars Ishaan Khatter and Ananya Pandey with Jaideep Ahlawat. The principal photography commenced on 11 September 2019, but was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was premiered on Zee Plex and ZEE5 on 2 October 2020, with simultaneous premiere at drive-in theatres of Gurugram and Bengaluru. The film has been set to release back theatrically on 16 October 2020 because theaters were re-opened first time after pandemic. ==Plot== Set in 2007, the story is about two childhood sweethearts Pooja and Blackie who get separated due to certain circumstances when they were kids. Pooja, who is now a prostitute, decides to escape the brothel on turning 18, with a bag full of stolen money. She bumps into Blackie who is now a very \"chalu\" Mumbai taxi driver. He agrees to \"drive\" her to freedom, in exchange for a hefty amount. This leads to a series of chase and escape \u2013 with the goons on Pooja's trail and the cops on the goons' trail. == Cast == * Ishaan Khatter as Vijay \"Blackie\" Chauhan ** Vedant Desai as Young Blackie * Ananya Panday as Pooja Gujjar ** Deshna Duggad as Young Pooja * Jaideep Ahlawat as Yusuf Chikna *Zakir Hussain as Inspector Tawde * Satish Kaushik as Inspector Bhim Singh * Swanand Kirkire as Choksi Seth * Suyash Tilak as Mangesh * Anup Soni as Ravi / Babuji * Kabir Duhan Singh * Bhushan Vikas as Mahesh * Vinod Nahardih as Mannu * Purnanand Wandekar as Jaidev * Vaishali Thakkar as Khala == Soundtrack == The film's music was composed by Vishal\u2013Shekhar, while lyrics were written by Kumaar and Raj Shekhar. The song \"Beyonce Sharma Jaayegi\" was criticised online for lyrics that some found racist. The song has been contrasted with Beyonc\u00e9's \"Brown Skin Girl\", as Rolling Stone India pointed out how on one hand, Beyonc\u00e9 is working towards the racial empowerment through her song, but the Bollywood song, names her, and says she will be \"embarrassed of fairskined Ananya Panday's dancing skills\". HuffPost India wrote \"What's a bit of racism sprinkled over the regular dose of sexism\".. News18 India said \"It seems despite the Black Lives Matter movement, the hashtags and the social media outrage, Bollywood hasn't learned much about racism\".. After receiving heavy backlash online, the director Maqbool Khan apologised. On 13 September, the producers changed the spelling of the title, from \"Beyonc\u00e9\" to \"Beyonse\". News18 India reported that Jay-Z trademarked and protected the name \"Beyonc\u00e9\" and it therefore cannot be used without their permission. The title was subsequently changed again, to \"Duniya Sharma Jayegi\". The video received 1 million dislikes within its first week on YouTube. == Reception == Devansh Sharma from Firstpost wrote \"After Beyond The Clouds and Dhadak, Khatter puts on display yet another side of his multifaceted personality. Khaali Peeli is his most 'commercial' film yet, a la Ranveer Singh in Rohit Shetty's Simmba. But rather than mimicking his idols, Khatter invents his style in conformity with a Mumbai taxi driver on a steady diet of Bollywood films for years \u2014 and makes a meal of it. Soumya Srivastava from Hindustan Times stated \"Khaali Peeli is a concoction that can only be brewed in the belly of Bollywood. With one chase sequence following on the tails of another, director Maqbool Khan ensures not a single moment is without its adrenaline dialled up to an 11. But it\u2019s quite shocking how easily one can grow bored of craziness as well\" Shubra Gupta from The Indian Express said \" Khaali Peeli knows that it needs to refresh the tropes it is up against, and manages to do so only some of the time in its two-hour duration\" Uma Ramasubramanian from Mid Day wrote \"Khaali Peeli is the perfect package for Khatter, who gets to showcase his dancing skills, action, drama, romance, comedy and biceps. Known for his love for offbeat films \u2014 Majid Majidi's Beyond the Clouds (2017) and forthcoming A Suitable Boy (2020) \u2014 the wonder boy is equally crackling in a typical Bollywood entertainer. Panday, though she carries the role efficiently, doesn't deliver authenticity to the character\" == References == ==External links== * * * Khaali Peeli on ZEE5 Category:Indian films Category:Hindi- language films Category:Indian romantic action films Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Film productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Indian direct-to-video films Category:Masala films ",
