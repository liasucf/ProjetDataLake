    "text": "The Lashtkhveri church of the Archangel (), also known as the church of Taringzel (Svan: \u10d7\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10dc\u10d2\u10d6\u10d4\u10da) is a medieval Georgian Orthodox church in the highland northwestern Georgian province of Upper Svaneti, now part of the Mestia Municipality, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region. Architecturally an unremarkable hall church, its most recognizable feature is a series of frescoes painted on both internal and external walls, dated to the 14th\u201315th century. Beyond religious scenes and portraits, the paintings include a rare illustration of episodes from the epic romance on Amiran-Darejaniani. The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. == Location == The Crucifixion, a fresco on the northern internal wall. The Lashtkhveri church stands at the southwestern edge of the village of Lashtkhveri (La\u0161txver), at 1380 m above sea level, in the Lenjeri territorial unit of the Mestia Municipality, at the foothills of the Greater Caucasus. This part of Svaneti was known as Free Svaneti in the 19th century. There are no contemporary literary sources on the construction and history of Lashtkhveri. The church and the items preserved in it were first described, in details, by the scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili during his expedition to Svaneti in 1910. == Layout == Amiran-Darejaniani, a fresco on the northern outer wall. The Archangel is a small and architecturally simple hall church, based on a two-step socle and built of neatly cut limestone blocks. The nave is divided up into two nearly equal bays by a pair of arched pilasters. The building can be entered from the west through a rectangular doorway with an internal arched tympanum. The church is lit by four windows, cut one each in the sanctuary and west wall and two in the east wall, one of them shedding light directly on the fresco depiction of an equestrian Saint George on the opposing wall. The sanctuary contains two arched niches, on either side of the window. The window frames on the exterior are decorated in carved stonework. The church is crowned by a simple cornice. Annexed to the west wall is a chamber built at a later date and roofed with blocks of wood. === Frescoes === The church is avidly adorned with frescoes, dated to the latter half of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th. The style of the paintings is a local take on the late Byzantine Palaeologan art, executed in a characteristically coarse manner. Inside the building, the conch and walls bear a series of frescoes depicting a Christological cycle, church fathers, and various saints. The outer walls also contain frescoes\u2014now partly faded\u2014including the hunting of Saint Eustace on the east fa\u00e7ade, haloed horsemen on the south, the Deesis on the west, and uniquely, scenes from the medieval Georgian romance Amiran-Darejaniani on the north. The paintings are accompanied by explanatory inscriptions in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti Category:Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia Category:Georgian Orthodox churches in Georgia (country) Category:14th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Svaneti ",
