    "text": "The Shire Hall is a former municipal building at Shinfield Park just south of Reading, Berkshire. ==History== Berkshire County Council originally established its meeting place in the assize courts in Reading and accommodated the administrative staff and committee rooms of the County Council were in the old Shire Hall next door. However following the Local Government Act 1972, which increased the geographical responsibilities of the County Council, the Council felt the need to move to larger premises. The new Shire Hall, which was designed in the Brutalist style to accommodate both the meeting place and the offices of the County Council, was completed in 1981. The estimated cost of the move was \u00a327.5 million. However following a review by the Local Government Commission the Government decided to transfer the responsibilities of the County Council to unitary authorities and the building became surplus to requirements. It became the local offices of Foster Wheeler in March 2000 and then, in October 2017, of Wood Group. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Reading, Berkshire R Category:Government buildings completed in 1981 ",
