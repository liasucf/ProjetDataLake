    "text": "Roll Over Beethoven is a British television sitcom produced by Central Independent Television and transmitted on the ITV (TV network) in 1985. Written by the duo Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, the series starred Nigel Planer as millionaire heavy metal star Nigel Cochrane, who turns life in a sleepy Surrey village upside down when he purchases the manor house, installing a recording studio in his new home and planning to record his first solo album there. He enlists the help of local piano teacher Belinda Purcell (Liza Goddard) to help him master the keyboard. An unlikely friendship \u2013 then romance \u2013 develops between the two as they collaborate on the album, much to the disapproval of Belinda's father, retired schoolmaster Oliver (Richard Vernon). As the series progresses, Nigel briefly leaves to go on a promotional tour of the album, while Belinda develops her talent for composing by working on an album of her own. ITV screened all thirteen episodes in one go with a week's break in April 1985, but Roll Over Beethoven was in fact recorded in two separate production blocks. The first six episodes were directed by Derrick Goodwin, whilst Nic Phillips took over for episodes 7\u201313. ==Cast== *Liza Goddard \u2013 Belinda Purcell *Nigel Planer \u2013 Nigel Cochrane (eps. 1\u20138 & 12) *Richard Vernon \u2013 Oliver Purcell *Desmond McNamara \u2013 Lem *Emlyn Price \u2013 Marvin Sertleman (eps. 9\u201313) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1980s British sitcoms Category:1985 British television series debuts Category:1985 British television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV sitcoms Category:Television shows produced by Central Independent Television Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows set in Surrey ",
