    "text": "Teresa Bernab\u00e9 (born 29 August 1983 in Madrid, Spain), better known as Tibi & her cello, is a Spanish cellist and singer-songwriter who combines voice and cello. ==Biography== Bernab\u00e9 began playing cello when she was 9 years old, and graduated as a cello teacher from the Professional Conservatory of Music \"Angel Arias Mace\u00edn\" in Madrid. Afterward she studied Musical Education in Madrid until 2006, when she moved to the United Kingdom due to a grant from AIE (\"Sociedad de Artistas Interpretes o Ejecutantes de Espa\u00f1a\") to study at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in Liverpool. ==Career== Bernab\u00e9 began her musical career in 2002 as a classical cellist, playing in orchestras in Madrid and France, until she decided to experiment in the world of modern music. She began working with Spanish bands such as Zahara, Alex Ferreira, Georgina, Richter, Martin Page, and Emerge. Since 2006, Bernab\u00e9 has played for other bands such as China Crisis, and has also started her own solo project: \"Tibi & her cello\". In 2008, Bernab\u00e9 collaborated as a member of \"Martin Page & The Polaroids\", winning the Ecopop Festival Award 2008 where she shared the stage with artist Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez, percussionist of Vetusta Morla. These days, she continues to collaborate with Zahara, China Crisis and Gary of the Crisis, and she is about to release her first EP Lost in the Sounds... as her own solo project. ==Style== Bernab\u00e9's method of playing cello differs from the conventional classic forms of playing the instrument, using an innovative technique that lets her play and sing at the same time. Her songs incorporate a wide range of elements and instruments, obtaining a sound closest to psychedelic folk. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Kallisti : Emerge (2006) as singer and cellist *Patchwork : Richter (2007) as cellist *Manifesto : Large and Loose (LIPA, Steve Berry) (2007) ===EPs=== *Un Domingo Cualquiera : Alex Ferreira (2007) as cellist ===Compilation albums=== *Lost in the Sounds..., April 2010 ==References== ==External links== * Tibi & her cello at Myspace * Tibi & her cello Biography at Last.FM Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish female singers Category:Spanish cellists Category:Musicians from Madrid Category:Singers from Madrid Category:Alumni of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts Category:Women cellists Category:21st-century Spanish singers Category:21st-century women singers ",
