Marble.http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=213137 He is currently Professor of Fluid Mechanics and professor emeritus at the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (attached to the Department of Motorcycle and Thermofluidodynamics of said school). He has taught at universities in California, Michigan and Princeton University in the United States and in Marseilles in France, among others. Since 1997 he is an adjunct professor at Yale University.https://www.eng.yale.edu/research/combustion/ ==Research== He has focused his research studies on the basic problems of combustion, both reactor and planetary probe dynamics, in the latter case working directly for NASA and the European Space Agency. Also, his work of applying mathematics to the problems of combustion have been considered pioneers in the world, to the point that the letters of presentation and support of his candidacy for the 1993 Prince of Asturias Awards, coming from universities and Research centers in various countries, do not hesitate to consider it as a relevant world theoretician in the field. The diffusion flame structure in counterflow is thoroughly analyzed by him in 1974 through activation-energy asymptotics.Li\u00f1\u00e1n, Amable. \"The asymptotic structure of counterflow diffusion flames for large activation energies.\" Acta Astronautica 1.7 (1974): 1007-1039. ==Publications== He is the author of several books and scientific research. * * * * ==Honors== In 1989 he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences. He is also a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering of Spain, France and Mexico. He is also a member of the scientific board of the IMDEA Energy Institute. He is also an elected foreign member of National Academy of Engineering for his contribution on asymptotic analyses in the field of combustion.https://www.nae.edu/130135.aspx In 2007 he received the \"Miguel Catal\u00e1n\" Research Award from the Community of Madrid and was awarded in 1993 with the Prince of Asturias Awardhttp://www.fpa.es/multimedia-en/photo-galleries/1993-prince-of-asturias- awards.html for Scientific and Technical Research.http://www.ugr.es/~kinetic/amable/ A workshop in honor of Li\u00f1\u00e1n's work was conducted in 2004http://www.ugr.es/~kinetic/amable/welcome.html and the workshop papers are published in a book titled Simplicity, rigor and relevance in fluid mechanics : a volume in honor of Amable Li\u00f1\u00e1n, CIMNE, (2004). ==See also== == References == ==External links== * Category:Spanish engineers Category:Fluid dynamicists Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Fellows of The Combustion Institute ",
