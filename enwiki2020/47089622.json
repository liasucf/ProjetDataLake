    "text": "Zachary Senyshyn (born March 30, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward. He is currently playing for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Senyshyn was selected by the Bruins in the 1st round (15th overall) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. He was born in Ottawa, Ontario. ==Playing career== Following the 2014\u201315 OHL season in which he scored 45 points in 65 games with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, Senyshyn was ranked number 38 by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau on their list of North American Skaters eligible for the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Expected to be drafted in the middle of the 2nd round, the Boston Bruins unexpectedly picked Senyshyn 15th overall with the pick acquired in exchange for Dougie Hamilton. During the 2015\u201316 season, Senyshyn was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins on November 12, 2015. He was assigned to the Bruins AHL team, the Providence Bruins in April 2017 to help them in their playoff run. Senyshyn then started the 2017\u201318 season with the Providence Bruins after being cut from Bruins training camp. Zach was recalled on April 3, 2019, and played his first NHL game the following evening against the Minnesota Wild. He also scored his first NHL goal in that game, an empty net goal in a 3\u20130 Bruin win. He was sent back down to Providence on April 7. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
