To the right is the police station for northeastern Gothenburg. Kortedala is a district, mainly residential (apartments), in the north-eastern part of Gothenburg in western Sweden. The area has a population of around 10,000 and is one of the typical 1950s suburbs of Gothenburg. The area has many trees and parks. Kortedala also has Gothenburg's largest ice-skating rink, Isdala, and a large sports centre, Alelyckan. There are four local squares, three smaller ones and the larger Kortedala Torg. Kortedala is on tram lines 6, 7 and 11, with line 6 terminating at Aprilgatan. In 2007, the Swedish musician Jens Lekman released an album titled Night Falls Over Kortedala. He also wrote a song called Tram #7 to Heaven about the tram to Bergsj\u00f6n (where the streets are named after things to do with outer space), which passes through Kortedala. == Places of interest == *Kortedala Torg - the main square. *Isdala - the ice rink. *Citytorget - another square, where many restaurants and fast food establishments are located.
