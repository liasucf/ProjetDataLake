    "text": "Now the People! (; ; ; ; ) is a political movement in the European Union. It was founded in April 2018 by a declaration from Catarina Martins from the Portuguese party Bloco de Esquerda, Pablo Iglesias from the Spanish party Podemos and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of La France Insoumise. After discussions about the austerity policy of the Greek government under Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party, the leaders of the leftist La France insoumise departed the Party of the European Left, joined by Iglesias and Podemos as well as Martins and Bloco. In June 2018, the Danish Red\u2013Green Alliance, Finnish Left Alliance and the Swedish Left Party co-operated with the French Maintenant le Peuple ! (MLP). The Portuguese, Finnish and Danish parties are members of both Now the People and Party of the European Left. Potere al Popolo, a coalition of several small left-wing parties and organisations in Italy, also \"lent its support\" to MLP, calling it \"a very important call proposed by three of the most popular alternatives from Europe [Left Bloc, Podemos and La France Insoumise], which we cannot ignore.\" However, as Potere al Popolo did not participate in the 2019 European Parliament election, and as it had no incumbent MEPs in the eighth European Parliament, it is not a full member of MLP. In the European elections, parties associated with MLP won a total of 14 seats. La France Insoumise won six seats, the most out of MLP's constituent parties. In the ninth European Parliament, MLP joined with other left-wing parties and independents, including the Party of the European Left from which MLP split, in the European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left group. ==Members== There are currently six members of MLP, not including Potere al Popolo (PaP). Except PaP, all are represented in the European Parliament for the ninth term, with three parties (the Red\u2013Green Alliance, the Left Alliance and the Left Party) sending one member to Parliament and another three (Podemos, La France Insoumise and the Left Bloc) sending multiple members. The Unidas Podemos list, which Podemos leads, elected six members to the European Parliament, but only three are members of Podemos and only three sit within MLP in the European Parliament. Two members of Unidas Podemos' list \u2014 Manu Pineda and Sira Rego \u2014 are members of the United Left (IU) and the third \u2014 Ernest Urtasun \u2014 is a member of Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV), which itself is a constituent party of the regional alliance Catalunya en Com\u00fa (CatCom\u00fa). None of IU, ICV or CatCom\u00fa are members of MLP. Furthermore, Urtasun does not sit with European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left as IU and Podemos do; he sits within the European Greens\u2013European Free Alliance group. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !colspan=2|Name !Country !Leader !2019 election list leader !Ideology !Position !Other European party !MEPs !National MPs !Government |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background-color: \" | |Left Bloc | |Catarina Martins |Marisa Matias |Socialism Eco-socialism Euroscepticism |Left-wing to far-left |European Anti-Capitalist Left Party of the European Left | | | |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background-color: \" | |We can (within Unidas Podemos) | |Pablo Iglesias |Mar\u00eda Eugenia Rodr\u00edguez Palop |Democratic socialism Direct democracy Left-wing populism |Left-wing |None | | | |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background- color: \" | |France Unbowed (with GRS) | |Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon |Manon Aubry |Democratic socialism Eco-socialism Anti-globalisation politics |Left-wing |None | | | |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background-color: \" | |Red\u2013Green Alliance | |Collective leadership |Nikolaj Villumsen |Socialism Eco-socialism Euroscepticism |Left-wing to far-left |European Anti-Capitalist Left Party of the European Left Nordic Green Left Alliance | | | |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background-color: \" | |Left Alliance | |Li Andersson |Silvia Modig |Democratic socialism Eco-socialism |Left-wing |Party of the European Left Nordic Green Left Alliance | | | |- ! width=\"5\" style=\"background-color: \" | |Left Party | |Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt |Malin Bj\u00f6rk |Socialism Feminism Euroscepticism |Left-wing |Nordic Green Left Alliance | | | |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Declaration Maintenant le peuple!
