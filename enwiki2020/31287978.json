It specialises in neurology, molecular biology and all aspects of human genetics. It also collaborates with the University of Cyprus on a Medical Genetics graduate programme. ==Scientific Advancement for Multiple Sclerosis== The study was performed from July 2007 until December 2010, according to the global standards of clinical research for the disease and with the participation of 80 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The study design and the medical protocol included many innovations leading to the preparation of the formulation. Unlike anything else available, this formulation (with the code PLP10) is a nutraceutical (with natural biomolecules), administered orally, can be co-administered with all other available treatments, showed great therapeutic effect in reducing the frequency of relapses (flares) of the disease but mainly on the progression of the disability of patients. Finally, it is also potentially able to trigger remyelination, neuroprotection and mainly free of side effects. It thus has the ability to influence a holistic treatment of the disease, since it can affect the total known biological and biochemical network of pathogenic / pathogenetic events and mechanisms that cause the disease, including the biochemical mechanisms responsible for remyelination and restoration of neurons (healing). Upon completion of our clinical study and research, we are pleased to be able to announce the of-international interest intriguing research results for the treatment of the disease in relation to the PLP10 preparation. The study was accepted and published in the British Medical Journal, in the open edition, after an independent assessment by world-class scientists with knowledge, long-term experience and international recognition in research and treatment of MS. The product is registered for a USA and a worldwide patent.Scientific Advancement by three Cypriot Scientists Hope for a new innovative treatment for Multiple Sclerosis ==See also== *Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute *The Cyprus Institute ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1990 Category:Medical and health organisations based in Cyprus Category:Neuroscience research centers in Cyprus Category:Research institutes in Cyprus Category:1990 establishments in Cyprus ",
