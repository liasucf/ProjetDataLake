At the trial held at Lancaster assizes on 2 September that year Carson on Angus's behalf maintained his own opinion as to the cause of death, against that of the four medical witnesses called for the Crown, among whom was John Bostock the younger. A verdict of not guilty was returned. Carson remained at Liverpool, and subsequently held several posts there. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 June 1837. He died at Sutton, St Helens, 12 August 1843. ==Works== Carson's inaugural essay at Edinburgh was De Viribus quibus Sanguis circumvehitur (1799). An early paper was \"On the Elasticity of the Lungs\" (Philosophical Transactions cx. 29\u201344).
