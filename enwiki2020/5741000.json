At that time the Department was offering associate degrees, endorsed by a higher education center and later Faculty of Agriculture. In 2004 and two years afterward the Department started enrolling students in rangeland-watershed management and forestry respectively. In 2006, the Department of Natural Resources was dissolved into two departments of rangeland-watershed management and forest science following a strong start in student acceptance at BSc. and MSc. levels. Later in 2009 together with a new department named \u201cFisheries and Environmental Science\u201d, the trio assembled an independent faculty coined as Natural Resources and Earth Science. Currently the Faculty employs 21 fulltime academic staff, teaching at BSc., MSc. and Ph.D.programs. Department: 1- Department of Rangeland-Watershed Management This department is among the oldest departments at the Shahrekord University. The department was inaugurated as the Department of Natural Resources in 1983. Enjoying a proper number of scientific staff, (5 associated and 4 assistant professors), the department accept students at one BS, four MS and three PhD levels. 2- Department of Forest Science Department of Forest Science was separated from the Department of Natural Resources in 2006 and become independent. Accordingly, the Department aims not only to offer the different courses of forestry training to prepare the required work force, but also to encourage local and national scientific research in different areas of Forest Sciences. The academic members\u2019 present areas of expertise are mostly in harmony with the educational and research needs of the program. There are six academic staffs (two associate and four assistant professors) engaging in research and teaching at the department. BS, MS and PhD programs (one each) are undertaken at the department too. 3-Department of Fisheries and Environmental Science The Department of Fisheries and Environmental Science has six scientific staff members and runs one BSc. and two MSc. programs. The main applied courses are held at three laboratory sites.

Department of Biotechnology livestock, poultry and fish Join Us Approach: Evaluate and identify researches in the field of biotechnology Providing appropriate facilities related to the biotechnology research for M.Sc. and Ph.D. student as Fellowship and Internship. Special services to other research centers. Short term and long term course for education in related fields for Iranian and Foreign students such as research periods and post-doctoral grade. Research Institute of Zoonotic Diseases History of human was associated with animals so that they have been considered as an inseparable part of human life. In this relation animal were source of different human infectious diseases. Zoonosis are infectious diseases of wild or domestic animals e.g. insects, mammals, reptiles, birds and especially vertebrates, that can naturally be transmitted to humans. Zoonosis can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Escherichia coli and Salmonella are among the most important significant zoonotic pathogens causing foodborne diseases. Today, zoonosis is among the most important public health and veterinary diseases which threat human and animal life. Due to spread of new emerging diseases which made huge problems for all world health organizations, and need a specific research center, Research Institute for Zoonotic Diseases (RIZD) was first established in Iran in October 2008. RIZD consist of a research committee and departments of Viral diseases, parasitic and fungal diseases, bacterial diseases, food borne diseases, drug resistant and drug residues and laboratory equipment including virology& bacteriology laboratory, cell culture and cellular diagnosis and animal house. During this period beside to performing several student thesis and research projects, more than 40 articles in scientific journal and 2 books have been published. For the future RIZD planned for connecting with other domestic and overseas research and health institutes for interested research project and offering specialty services. Research Institute of Nanotechnology The nanotechnology committee was formed in October 2007 by a group of faculty members at this university. After one year, the university received official permission to start a nanotechnology research center. This center started its activities with two groups namely: nano-materials and computational nanotechnology. The main objectives of this center include: * Determination of research objectives based on the state\u2019s requirements * Determination of short term, midterm, and long term research goals * Development of related programs and training students in nanotechnology fields * Performing research in different areas in nanotechnology * Performing research in nanotechnology based on state wide and nationwide requirements for government and private sectors The Technology incubator Center of Shahrekord University The technology incubator center of Shahrekord University was established in 2009. Up to now it has been supported the new idea in the various fields including design and produce of industrial devices, agricultures and food industries, nanotechnology, veterinary services, information technology and other subjects which have the ability becoming to advanced technology. ==See also== *Higher education in Iran Category:Universities in Iran Category:Educational institutions established in 1947 Category:Education in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province Category:1947 establishments in Iran Category:Buildings and structures in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province ",
