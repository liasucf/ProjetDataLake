His highest rank to date has been sekiwake. He has two gold stars for defeating yokozuna and two special prize for Outstanding Performance. He wrestles for the Oitekaze stable. ==Early life and education== Hayato Takanishi was born on 10 November 1993 in Asaka, a city in Saitama Prefecture. He started sumo after winning a local tournament during his first year in elementary school. He attended , a school famous for its sumo club, and earned a place in the club's first team near the end of his second year. In his final year he contributed to the school finishing in second place in the team competition at national championships. After graduation he joined Oitekaze stable to pursue a professional sumo career. ==Career== ===Early career=== Takanishi Hayato entered sumo under his birth name but adopted the ring name Daishoei for his first competitive tournament. He won the jonokuchi division with a 7\u20130 record in March 2012 and a 6\u20131 record in jonidan in May saw him promoted to sandanme where he recorded four wins in July. He then modified his ring name slightly and became Daieish\u014d. After winning records in the next two tournaments he was promoted to makushita but struggled in higher division and was relegated back to sandanme. A perfect 7\u20130 in May 2013 saw him take the divisional championship and secure a return to makushita. After three consecutive winning records (kachi-koshi) Daieish\u014d was promoted to the second highest j\u016bry\u014d division for the July 2014 tournament, the 14th former student of Saitama Sakae's coach Michinori Yamada to reach the rank. After performing consistently in j\u016bry\u014d for a year he earned promotion to the top division (makuuchi) with a 9\u20136 record in July 2015. ===Makuuchi career=== In September 2015 Daieish\u014d made his makuuchi debut at the rank of maegashira 13. He was the youngest man in the division at 21 years old. He won seven of his first fourteen bouts, including an upset victory over Takarafuji but a final day defeat against Takekaze saw him end the tournament with a 7\u20138 losing record (make-koshi). In November he recorded only six wins and was demoted to j\u016bry\u014d but returned to the top division after an 8\u20137 record in January 2016. In March 2016 Daieish\u014d produced a career-best effort, recording ten wins including victories over Ichinoj\u014d and Takekaze to place him in a tie for seventh place. In May, at career-high rank of maegashira 9 he stood at 6\u20134 after ten days but then slumped to five consecutive defeats. He struggled again in July, recording only five wins and dropped to maegashira 16 for September. His seven tournament run in the top division ended after a 5\u201310 record saw him relegated to j\u016bry\u014d for the November tournament but he responded with eight wins to put himself back in contention for promotion. In January 2017 he won the j\u016bry\u014d division with a 12\u20133 record to secure his promotion back to makuuchi. He produced his best result in the top division to date in the March 2017 tournament, winning his last eight bouts in a row to finish on 11\u20134. This saw him promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 3 for the May tournament. Facing all the yokozuna and \u014dzeki for the first time, he followed his eight consecutive wins in March with eight losses in his first eight bouts in May and finished with a 4\u201311 record. After falling to maegashira 13 with a poor 5\u201310 score in November 2017, he recovered somewhat to post consecutive 9\u20136 records in the January and March tournaments of 2018. He reached maegashira 2 in March 2019, and remained near the top of the maegashira ranks in the next few tournaments. In September he earned his first kinboshi with a defeat of Kakury\u016b, his first win over a yokozuna in eleven attempts. He attained a career highest rank of maegashira 1 in the November 2019 tournament, and earned his career kinboshi on Day 2 with a first win over Hakuh\u014d in five attempts. Hakuh\u014d went on to win the tournament and as the only man to defeat him, Daieisho received the Outstanding Performance Prize. He made his debut at the komusubi rank in January 2020, narrowly failing to secure a majority of wins, finishing on 7\u20138. He returned to komusubi in July 2020, where he defeated Hakuh\u014d again, won his last six bouts to finish on 11\u20134 and won his second Outstanding Performance Prize. He was promoted to sekiwake for the September 2020 tournament, the first sekiwake from Saitama Prefecture since Wakachichibu in July 1963. ==Fighting style== Daieish\u014d is a tsuki and oshi specialist, which means he relies on thrusting and pushing techniques to defeat his opponents rather than belt-wrestling. By far the most common of his winning techniques is oshidashi which accounts for 55% of his wins. Although he also used belt gripping techniques during his high school career, he has focused on pushing and thrusting since turning professional. In an interview upon the announcement of his promotion to Juryo in May 2014, Daieish\u014d was quoted as saying he wanted to thrust like former \u014dzeki Chiyotaikai. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of active gold star earners *List of sekiwake ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Saitama Prefecture Category:Sekiwake ",
