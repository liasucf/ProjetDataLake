    "text": "Daniel Smith (born 5 October 1986) is an English former professional footballer. A full back, he previously played professionally in the Premier League for Sunderland, in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, and in the Scottish Premier League for Aberdeen. He also appeared in the Scottish Football League as a triallist for St Johnstone, and played in non-League football for Gateshead, Blyth Spartans, Chester-le-Street Town, Darlington 1883, Dunston UTS and Seaham Red Star. He ended his career in Australia, playing for state-level sides Holland Park Hawks and Peninsula Power. ==Club career== ===Sunderland=== Smith was born in Sunderland, and began his football career with his home-town club. He made his Sunderland first-team debut in the Football League Cup second round against Cheltenham Town in September 2005, in which he was sent off, receiving two bookings. In January 2006, he joined Football League One club Huddersfield Town on a month's loan, later extended for a second month, during which he played eight League games. After returning to Sunderland, Smith played in three Premier League matches at the end of the season, in the last of which he committed a bad tackle, described in The Independent as a \"studs-up lunge\", on Arsenal player Abou Diaby, causing the player to suffer a fractured ankle and ruptured ankle ligaments. Arsenal initially threatened legal action over the incident, and Diaby was out of action for eight months. ===Scotland=== Despite having signed a new one-year deal with Sunderland during the summer of 2006, Smith joined Scottish Premier League (SPL) club Aberdeen in August on a three-year contract. He made his debut appearance in the Dons' 1\u20131 draw against St Mirren in the SPL. After making just 13 appearances for the club, he was released at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. After trial spells at Port Vale and Darlington, Smith turned out as a trialist for St Johnstone in their First Division match against Morton on 9 August 2008. Following that match, Saints manager Derek McInnes confirmed that Smith would continue to train with the squad for a week, and he played in the next two matches, but was not offered a contract. ===Later career=== Smith joined Conference North side Gateshead on 20 November 2008. He made ten starts, all but one in the league, and two substitute appearances, and was released at the end of the season. In March 2010, Smith signed for Blyth Spartans, also of the Conference North, with a view to regaining fitness. With the club in an injury crisis, he was named once on the substitutes' bench, but never appeared for the club. In the 2011\u201312 season, he played for Chester-le-Street Town in the Northern League second division. Smith was one of Martin Gray's first batch of signings as new manager of Darlington 1883, demoted to the Northern League First Division for 2012\u201313. Smith was released by Darlington at the end of November and signed for Dunston UTS in December. On 27 February 2013, Smith joined Seaham Red Star. On 19 July 2013, Smith rejoined Gateshead, managed by his brother Anth, after a trial spell during pre season. On 31 January 2014, Smith had his contract cancelled to allow him to pursue his career abroad. He landed in Australia where he joined Holland Park Hawks, captaining the side to consecutive promotions. In 2017, he left the club midseason to join Peninsula Power. He later returned to the North East, setting up a spray painting business. ==References== === Infobox stats === * Sunderland, Huddersfield Town: * Aberdeen: * St Johnstone (trial): * Gateshead: === Citations === Category:1986 births Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Association football defenders Category:Blyth Spartans A.F.C. players Category:Chester-le-Street Town F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Dunston UTS F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English footballers Category:Footballers from Tyne and Wear Category:Gateshead F.C. players Category:Holland Park Hawks FC players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Living people Category:National League (English football) players Category:Northern Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Seaham Red Star F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Category:St Johnstone F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players ",
