    "text": "Berg's Review of Games ( BROG) was a publication started by game designer Richard Berg. The magazine debuted in 1991 and has since made its archive available on online. The publication featured reviews of wargames. ==Content== The magazine is known for its thoughtful but often savage tone. One World War II game received the review: \"Playing this game makes Sisyphus' task a lark in the park.\" Every year, Berg's Review of Games hands out the satirical \"Little Macs,\" which are awarded for dubious achievements in gaming. The award is named for recalcitrant American Civil War general George McClellan. No game or designer is immune, as one of Berg's own games was awarded a \"Little Mac\" for using game pieces with cardstock so thin that the pieces as to be described as \"see through.\" ==Reception== Berg's Review of Games won the 1992 Origins Award for Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1992, and again in 1993, and 1995. BROG was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design's Hall of Fame in 1997. ==References== ==External links== * E-BROG Category:1991 establishments in the United States Category:Game magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Hobby magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1991 Category:Magazines with year of disestablishment missing Category:Origins Award winners ",
