He graduated in the top of his class. ===Post-collegiate/professional=== Following college, Shay ran professionally, winning races at various distances, including marathon, half-marathon, 20 km and 15 km.

Autopsy results were initially inconclusive, leading to speculation over other possibilities for his death. On March 18, 2008, Ellen Borakove, the Director of Public Affairs of the New York Chief Medical Examiner's Office released the following statement to Joe Shay, Ryan's father, regarding his final autopsy results: \"Cardiac arrhythmia due to cardiac hypertrophy with patchy fibrosis of undetermined etiology.
