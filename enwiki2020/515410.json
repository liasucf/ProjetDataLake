    "text": "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is one of two separate dog breeds known as Welsh Corgis that originated in Wales; the other is the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles. Cardigan Welsh Corgis are known to be an extremely loyal dog breed. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings. They benefit from regular physical and mental stimulation. ==History== Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis were originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club in Britain in 1925, but were declared separate breeds in 1935. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately. ===Origins=== blue merle-colored Cardigan One theory is that both breeds of the corgis descended from a line of northern spitz-type dogs. Another is that they descended from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds. ===Name=== The word \"corgi\" is derived from the , which means \"dwarf dog\". The breed was formerly called \"yard-long dog\" (). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion'). ===Modern breed=== Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship. ==Description== The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail. The old American Kennel Club standard called it an \"Alsatian on short legs\". The Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long,Hyt\u00f6nen et al. (2008), \"Ancestral T-box mutation is present in many, but not all, short-tailed dog breeds\", Journal of Heredity, Advance Access published online on October 14, 2008, naturally bobbed or docked). Cardigans, which are double coated, come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the \"Irish pattern.\" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.). An average Cardigan is around tall at the withers and weighs from for the male and for the female. Life expectancy is 12\u201316 years. Litter size can vary; usually four to six puppies. ===Health=== The most common causes of death for the breed were cancer (28.3%), old age (24.6%), and neurological disorders (15.2%). Canine Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is known to occur in the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. This is likely due to the Cardigan being a dwarf (chondrodysplastic) breed, and these breeds frequently suffer from Type I disk disease. This disease is commonly found in the Dachshund breed. ==Temperament== * Originally bred for farm work, including herding sheep and cattle. Cardigan Welsh Corgis were bred long and low to make sure that any kicks by cattle would travel safely over the dogs' heads without touching them. * Cardigans are highly intelligent, active, athletic dogs. * Housepet They have proven themselves as excellent companion animals, Cardigans are affectionate, devoted companions that can also be alert and responsible guardians. If socialized at a young age, they can be nice with other dogs and housepets. * Competitive in sheepdog trials, dog agility, competitive obedience and rally obedience. * Guard Dogs They are great watch dogs, but if it's a guard dog it will do not as well as the better choices. ==Use as working dogs== Cardigan Welsh Corgis compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball and tracking events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.
