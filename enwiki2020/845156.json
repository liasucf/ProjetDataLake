    "text": "KHET, virtual and VHF digital channel 11, branded as PBS Hawai'i, is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. The station is owned by the Hawaii Public Television Foundation, which is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. For almost 50 years, KHET's studios were located on Dole Street on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu. In 2016, the station moved to its current location on Sand Island Access Road, in a renovated and expanded facility and former site of KFVE (channel 9) and KHNL (channel 13). KHET's main transmitter is located on Palehua Ridge, north of Makakilo.FCC information for KHET The station's signal is relayed across the rest of the state outside Oahu and metropolitan Honolulu on full-powered satellite KMEB (virtual and VHF digital channel 10) in Wailuku on Maui (with transmitter on the summit of Haleakala) and through a network of low-powered translators on the other Hawaiian Islands. It can also be seen statewide on Oceanic Spectrum channel 11 (10 on Oahu) and digital channel 1010 in high definition, and on Hawaiian Telcom channel 11. ==Station history== Logo as \"PBS Hawaii\"; used from 2016 to early January 2020 KHET signed on the air for the first time on April 15, 1966; KMEB followed on six months later on September 22 of that year. KHET is the second outlet in Honolulu to occupy the channel 11 dial position, the first being KONA-TV from 1952 to 1955, when it moved to channel 2 because the higher VHFs (2 to 6) offered more ERPs at the time; that station is now KHON-TV. Had KONA not moved to channel 2, the channel would have remained a commercial allocation, as the FCC had intended to make channel 7 a non-commercial allocation for Honolulu in the first assignment, but the FCC relocated channel 7 to Wailuku in 1959 and made channel 11 a non-commercial allocation instead (the Wailuku allocation was intended to be on channel 8). Originally known on-air as \"Hawaii Educational Television\" (or \"Hawaii ETV\"), it rebranded as \"Hawaii Public Television\" in 1970 and then became \"PBS Hawai'i\" in 2003. PBS Hawaii broadcasts 24 hours a day on cable television, but airs only from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m. daily on its over-the-air broadcast signal; this makes it one of the few remaining television stations in the United States that continues to sign off during the overnight hours. Original materials from PBS Hawaii have also been contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The stations' digital signals are multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
