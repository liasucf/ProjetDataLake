    "text": "Marko Vasi\u0107 (), known as Kara-Marko () was a Serbian Revolutionary ==Life and career== Vasi\u0107 was born into a large zadruga (patriarchal extended family) in the Gru\u010di\u0107i hamlet in the village of Crvica, in the Osat region. He was a blacksmith by trade. As one of the strongest and bravest in Osat, he was chosen to lead the Serb villagers in the region against Janissary attacks. With the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising (1804), archimandrite and rebel leader Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 called on him and his fellows to support the rebels against the Dahije in the first fights on the Drina. He led rebels alongside Had\u017ei Melentije, Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 and Jakov Nenadovi\u0107. After his heroic deeds had been heard, supreme commander Kara\u0111or\u0111e summoned him and gave him the nickname \"Kara-Marko\". Kara\u0111or\u0111e lent Kara-Marko an army and vojvoda (general) Lazar Mutap to liberate Osat and Srebrenica from the Ottomans. Kara-Marko and Mutap liberated most of Osat until the Ottoman Army attacked and the rebels retreated across the Drina. His wife was killed during the retreat. After the Pe\u0107ani Assembly (17 April 1805), Kara-Marko participated in the liberation of U\u017eice. In 1806 he returned to Podrinje with Had\u017ei-Melentije with whom he led fights against the Turks on the Sikiri\u0107 ferry on the Drina. With Had\u017ei-Melentije, Milan Obrenovi\u0107, Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 and Sima Bir\u010danin he led the Serb rebel army against the Turks on Lu\u010dindan 1808 in Oklenac, Vranjkovina in Osat, and Pribi\u0107evac near Srebrenica. In this skirmish he led the army in an assault from Skelani to Srebrenica and Osma\u010de, then a battle was fought in Pribi\u0107evac. Luka Lazarevi\u0107 mentioned him in his memoirs, regarding fights in Osat and Srebrenica in 1809: \"Karamarko expels the Turks, and rises the [Orthodox] Christians against them\". After Had\u017ei-Melentije left for the Russian Empire in 1810, Kara\u0111or\u0111e appointed Kara-Marko the vojvoda of the Sokol nahija (district) and a military senior (stare\u0161ina) in Ra\u010da. At this time, his clerk was Ni\u0107ifor Ninkovi\u0107, and his buljuba\u0161e (captains) were Petar and Janko. After an intrigue, Kara\u0111or\u0111e had him removed on 7 April 1813, after which he was for a short period with Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 in Valjevo. In May 1813 he gathered an army and crossed into Osat to defend it from the Ottomans. He was one of few that did not flee to the Habsburg Monarchy after the suppression of the uprising. He settled a village near Topola and became a hajduk (brigand). Due to his loyalty to Kara\u0111or\u0111e, the new Serbian leader Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 ordered his murder and had his severed head given to the Vizier of Belgrade. The rest of his body were brought by his descendants to the church in Grabovac near Valjevo to be buried in the porta in 1845. ==See also== *Luka Milovanov Georgijevi\u0107 (1784\u20131828) * List of Serbian Revolutionaries ==References== Notes Sources * * * * * Category:18th-century births Category:1815 deaths Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:Serbian revolutionaries Category:People of the First Serbian Uprising Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:People from Srebrenica Category:Hajduks Category:Trophy heads Category:Serbian blacksmiths Category:Assassinations in the Ottoman Empire ",
