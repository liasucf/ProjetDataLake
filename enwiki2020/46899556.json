    "text": "Libido is the sixteenth album by experimental French singer Brigitte Fontaine, released in 2006 on the Polydor label. It once again features a collaboration with -M- on the song Mister Myst\u00e8re, which -M- also sang solo on his fourth album, to which it gave its title. Brigitte Fontaine, for the first time in more than thirty years, calls upon arranger Jean-Claude Vannier for some songs, Barbe \u00e0 papa and Mendelssohn. The title of Ch\u00e2teau int\u00e9rieur comes from a book by Teresa of \u00c1vila, although Fontaine admitted she didn't read it. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Lyrics: Brigitte Fontaine * Music: Areski Belkacem except 6, 7 composed by Jean-Claude Vannier, 11 composed by -M-. * Direction: Areski Belkacem except 7 (Jean-Claude Vannier), 11 (-M-). * Editions Allo Music/Labo M Edition & Jean-Claude Vannier \u00e9ditions ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
