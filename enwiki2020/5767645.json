    "text": "The Marconi Trail is a scenic roadway in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Located in eastern Cape Breton Island, the route is entirely within the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and runs from Louisbourg to Glace Bay along the island's eastern coast. The Glace Bay terminus is at the Marconi National Historic Site, which marks the location of the first radio transmission from North America to Europe, made by Guglielmo Marconi in 1902. The Marconi Trail measures approximately in length. ==Mira Gut Bridge== Macroni Trail crossed the Mira River along Mira Bay Drive at the community of Mira Gut along the 140-year-old Mira Gut Bridge. In 2017, the structure was demolished after it was deemed unsafe. A replacement bridge is slated to be open in 2022, but in the meantime travelers must take a detour along Brickyard Road and Hornes Road (Route 255), crossing the Mira River along Trunk 22 at Albert Bridge. ==Highways== === Numbered === * Route 255 === Named Roads === * Louisbourg Main-\u00e0-Dieu Road * Main-\u00e0-Dieu Road * Mira Bay Drive * Long Beach Road * Donkin Highway ==Communities== *Louisbourg *Little Lorraine *Main-\u00e0-Dieu *Bateston *Catalone Gut *Mira Gut *Round Island *Homeville *Black Brook *Port Morien *Donkin *Port Caledonia *Glace Bay ==References== Category:Guglielmo Marconi Category:Scenic travelways in Nova Scotia Category:Roads in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality ",
