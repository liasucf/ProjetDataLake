    "text": "Merrill Davis Osmond (born April 30, 1953) is the lead singer and bassist of the family music group The Osmonds and The Osmond Brothers. He continues to perform, both as a solo artist and with his younger brother Jay Osmond under the Osmonds banner. ==Early life== Osmond was born in Ogden, Utah, the fifth of the nine children of Olive May (n\u00e9e Davis; 1925 \u2013 2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917\u20132007). ==Career== Four of the Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. They also appeared in nine episodes of the 1963\u20131964 ABC western television series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Merrill in the role of young Deuteronomy Kissel. The series starred then 12-year-old Kurt Russell on a wagon train headed to the American West. A tenor/countertenor vocalist well into adulthood, Merrill was either lead singer or co-lead singer (usually sharing duties with younger brother Donny) on almost all of the Osmonds' songs and co- wrote, along with older brother Alan, many of them. When Donny began to focus on his own career in the late 1970s, Merrill grew out his beard and, along with his brothers, shifted to country music, recording a number of hits on the country charts in the 1980s; he also had one hit independent of his fellow Osmonds, a duet with session singer Jessica Boucher (younger sister of Savannah and Sherry Boucher), \"You're Here to Remember (I'm Here to Forget),\" which peaked at number 62 on the Hot Country Singles chart in May 1987. Merrill has been twice knighted, once by the Order of Saint Michael of the Wing and once by the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem. In May 2017, Merrill received an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Humanities from Dixie State University. ==Personal life== Merrill was the first of the performing Osmond siblings to marry. He wed Mary Carlson on September 17, 1973; they have four sons, two daughters, and 15 grandchildren. Merrill's second son, Justin Osmond, is deaf, as are Justin's uncles, Virl and Tom Osmond, Merrill's two oldest brothers. Justin Osmond works with several organizations and launched the Olive Osmond Perpetual Hearing Fund in 2010. Merrill's youngest son, Troy, died in his sleep at the age of 33 on November 9, 2018. Like the rest of his family, Merrill is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In keeping with church tradition, all of his sons have served as missionaries. ==References== ==External links== *Merrill Osmond Official website * Category:1953 births Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:American male singers Category:American pop singers Category:American tenors Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American country bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:American songwriters Category:American country singers Category:American rock singers Category:Musicians from Ogden, Utah Category:Living people Category:The Osmonds members Category:People from Branson, Missouri Category:Osmond family (show business) Category:Guitarists from Utah Category:20th-century American bass guitarists Category:Country musicians from Missouri Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
