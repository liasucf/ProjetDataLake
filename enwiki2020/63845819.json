In 1618 the London poet and boat-man John Taylor came to Scotland and met Auchmoutie at Burntisland, with other courtiers. After going north to Braemar, Taylor visited Auchmoutie and his brothers James and Alexander at Auldhame (Scoughall) with James Achesoun of Gosford. They ate the local Solan goose from the Bass Rock served as a special dish at a separate table from dinner, and washed down with Spanish sack, in the manner that oysters were then usually served.P. Hume Brown, Early Travellers in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1891), pp. 113, 126-7. Auchmoutie performed in the masque For the Honour of Wales by Ben Jonson first performed on 17 February 1618.
