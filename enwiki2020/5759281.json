    "text": "Andrew Zega (born 1961) is an American-born artist, architectural historian and writer residing in Paris, France. He was educated at Princeton University and began his career as an architectural designer and watercolorist for Robert A.M. Stern Architects in Manhattan. Andrew Zega and Bernd H. Dams both create watercolors of historic American and European buildings and garden ornament. Their work is noted for its realist technique and historical accuracy. The artists, both trained architects, employ the conventions of architectural rendering to re-create destroyed and altered monuments in their initial state, as well as to present unbuilt projects with exceptional realism. The chief value of their work is the enlarged and precise view it thus offers of European\u2014and particularly French\u2014architectural history. Their expertise is Ancien R\u00e9gime French architecture\u2014that of the 17th and 18th centuries\u2014and particularly French royal ch\u00e2teaux and gardens, most notably the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles and the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly, the monumental estates of King Louis XIV. In various publications, they have re-examined the genesis of both ch\u00e2teaux, and have renounced the traditional authorship of Versailles to Louis Le Vau in favor of a triumvirate of Le Vau, Charles Le Brun and Claude Perrault; and have attributed Marly's creation to Le Brun, renouncing the traditional attribution to Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Their watercolors are held in many private and public collections, including those of: The New-York Historical Society, The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, The Museum of the \u00cele-de- France, Princeton University, Jayne Wrightsman, Brooke Astor, Robert Denning, Hubert de Givenchy, and Oscar de la Renta. They have written four books illustrated with their work: Pleasure Pavilions and Follies (1995), Garden Vases (2000), Palaces of the Sun King (2002) and Chinoiseries (2006). Beside the value of their reconstruction drawings, the books are notable for their analysis of architecture and its accompanying social history from an architect's perspective, which is highly unusual in a field dominated by writers trained as art historians. == Notes and references == Category:French watercolourists Category:Living people Category:Artists from Paris Category:Princeton University alumni Category:1961 births Category:Writers from Paris Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters Category:French male writers ",
