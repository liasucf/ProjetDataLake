It was serviced to contemporary hit radio formats in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2018 as the ninth and final single from the album. A pop song, Lipa uses a deadpan vocal delivery, back by an electro palm-muted electric guitar riff and a militaristic drum line. Lyrically, the song is about an ex-boyfriend who intends to get back with Lipa, before she sends him on his way. The song was called a sequel to \"New Rules\" (2017). Upon its release, \"IDGAF\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising the meaning and production. The song reached number 3 and 49, respectively on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, the song reached the top 10 in 20 territories worldwide, including Croatia and Ireland, where it reached the summit.

It was nominated for British Single of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. The music video for \"IDGAF\" accompanied its single release and was directed by Henry Scholfield. It features two versions of Lipa, a vulnerable romantic and an empowered spirit, who perform a dance battle against one and other with their respective girl groups. One group wears purple and the other wears orange. The video received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its self-love message and the choreography. Lipa promoted the single with numerous live performances, including ones on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. ==Background and composition== \"IDGAF\" was written by Lipa alongside MNEK, Larzz Principato, Skyler Stonestreet and Whiskey Water, with production from Koz. They wrote it in Los Angeles in February 2017 and was one of the last songs recorded for Dua Lipa. Lipa was inspired after an ex-boyfriend who was really mean to, message her saying \"Hi\" and expressing his enjoyment of her music, which made her think, \"What gives him the right to call me now and see how I'm doing? Does he not realize the damage he's done?\" Lipa stated that parts of the song are true and parts are false. The song was recorded at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and Sarm Music Village in London, while mixing was done by Josh Gudwin and mastering was handled by John Davis at Metropolis Mastering in London. \"IDGAF\" is a pop song, running for 3 minutes and 38 seconds. The song is composed time and the key of E minor, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute and a chord progression of Em\u2013D\u2013G/Bm\u2013C. The track is backed by an electro palm-muted electric guitar riff, a militaristic drum line, a piano and a multi-tracked chorus. Lipa uses a deadpan vocal delivery, ranging two octaves from D3 to D5. Natalie Maher of Billboard wrote that the song sees Lipa \"powerfully [reminding] her ex that she is most certainly not thinking about him,\" while Rolling Stones Jonah Weiner called it a sequel to \"New Rules\" (2017), \"where a former romantic tormentor crawls out of the woodwork, interested in rekindling things, and Lipa mercilessly sends him packing.\" ==Release and promotion== \"IDGAF\" was released through Warner Bros. Records on 2 June 2017, serving as the fifth track on Lipa's eponymous debut studio album. In November of that year, Lipa confirmed that it would serve as a single, to be released in 2018 due to the rising success of \"New Rules\". On 8 January 2018, she announced its official single release and revealed the cover art. The song was serviced to contemporary hit radio formats in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2018, as the ninth and final single from Dua Lipa. It was also serviced to that radio format in Australia and Italy, as well as adult contemporary radio in the United Kingdom. On 27 February 2018, the song impacted contemporary hit radio in the United States as the album's fourth single in the country. Two remix extended plays were released for \"IDGAF\", including remixes by Young Franco, Initial Talk, Diablo and Rich Brian, featuring Saweetie as well as an acoustic version. The Young Franco remix reimagines it as a house song with danceable beats. The Initial Talk remix is a 1980s-inspired new jack swing track. The club-heavy Diablo Remix includes an additional verse with vocals from Rich Brian. Saweetie features on a remix of the song where she adds to its two verses, while lyrically adding to its female empowerment themes and showing her money moves. On 17 July 2020, Lipa released a demo to YouTube of the song where she sings in French in the pre-chorus. The track was intended to be released to music platforms featuring Ma\u00eetre Gims, however went unreleased. ==Critical reception== \"IDGAF\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jamie Milton of NME labelled the song a \"post-breakup punch,\" while Dorks Jamie Muir stated that it \"[drops] the bubblegum sharpness.\" For Clash, Alex Green categorized the drums as \"crisp\" and the lyrics \"cutting,\" while calling it \"likely the best track off the album.\" In AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung called the song \"cheeky\" and compared it to the works of Ed Sheeran. He concluded by stating it is a \"perfect anthem for anyone who has ever been burned by love.\" The Young Folks Manzanares de la Rosa stated it has \"post- breakup snark\" and called it a \"welcome breath of fresh air among the batch of singles.\" Sean Ward from The 405, praised the song for being a \"stadium stomper\" and predicted it to be a \"dormant hit,\" while also viewing it as \"a bright indicator to the longevity of [Lipa's] chart domination.\" He concluded by labelling the chorus \"gigantic,\" the hook \"memorable,\" and praising those aspects for being \"radio A-list whilst retaining a subtle cool.\" Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised \"IDGAF\" for being \"decisive\" and Lipa's \"don't mess\" attitude, while commenting that it \"[cuts] through the texture.\" For the Evening Standard, Rick Pearson stated the song shows Lipa's \"edgier side.\" Max Mazonowicz of The Digital Fix called melody \"terrific\" and the chorus \"punchy\" and \"not safe for work.\" Sebas E. Alonso from Jenesaispop called the track a \"hymn of self-sufficiency\" and compared the guitar to \"Shape of You\" (2017) by Sheeran and TLC's \"No Scrubs\" (1999). In a negative review from The Line of Best Fit, Claire Biddles thought the song felt \"forced,\" further elaborating writing \"like she\u2019s convincing herself that she doesn\u2019t care.\" She went on to call it a \"relatable charade\" that \"falls a little flat,\" while also criticizing her lack of \"carefree persona,\" unlike other tracks on Dua Lipa. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ Awards and nominations for \"IDGAF\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Organization ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| BMI Pop Awards | 2019 | Award Winning Songs | | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Brit Awards | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | British Single of the Year | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| |- | British Video of the Year | |- ! scope=\"row\"| MTV Video Music Awards | 2018 | Best Choreography | | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| MTV Video Play Awards | 2018 | Winning Video | | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| People's Choice Awards | 2018 | Music Video of 2018 | | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Music Video Awards | 2018 | Best Pop Video \u2013 UK | | align=\"center\"| |} ==Commercial performance== \"IDGAF\" debuted at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart issue dated 5 January 2018.

The video opens by panning around a solid-coloured lapis blue room, underneath a white oval light. Two versions of Lipa are seen wearing pantsuits with button down crop-tops underneath, one in purple and one in orange, with the orange having slicked- back hairdo and the blue having a tidy bun. They represent the vulnerable romantic and the empowered spirit stages that follow a break-up. Viewers are the slowly shown Lipa's backup dancers, who, like Lipa, have alternate versions that wear orange and purple. The two groups (orange and purple) begin shuffled between one and other, with the two versions of Lipa portraying an annoyed conversation. The two groups eventually take their respective colours side, with Lipa as the head. They begin to perform aggravated gestures and expressive choreography. The blue team jumps up, while the red team put their hands under their chins, pointing it at the blues. The blues walk to corner looking backwards while Lipa looks to the camera, with the group eventually walking towards the reds and lean over them. They all roll their shoulders before putting their hands in front of each other. The backup dancers then leave and the two Lipas are seen staring at each other while laying on the floor. When they are seen standing up again, they groups run up to the other, before each dancer takes a turn, spinning around their alter ego and going the way their alter ego came. The room turns back to a lapis blue light before the reds fall to the floor, watching the blues dance. The blue Lipa then turns towards the camera as the red one looks backwards at a closing door. The blue Lipa then kisses the red Lipa on the forehead. The doors open again and each group goes in separate lines to perform a dance, before joining as a full group to continue their dance. The visual closes with the two Lipas nodding at one and other before turning to face their group. ===Reception=== In V, Rayne H. Ellis summarized the video as \"a clear tale of self-love and empowerment,\" while also praising its storyline. Billboard editor Nicholas Rice wrote that it sees Lipa \"visualizing the internal struggle one faces through her hot and cold outfit color choices and interpretive dancing.\" Sara Cristiano of Much called the backup dancers \"extremely talented\" and compared their \"realness\" to Annie Lennox. Teen Vogues Gabe Bergado labelled the dancers \"stunning\" and compared its ethos to that of \"New Rules\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Ryan Reed viewed the video as \"kinetic\" and \"heavily choreographed.\" Nora-Grayce Orosz from Complex stated that Lipa \"bringing all the sass of her previous releases times two,\" and named the \"[expert]\" choreography \"old-school.\" Reviewing for Spin, Tosten Burks called the video \"bold-hued.\" Nylons Hafeezah Nazim complimented the \"intense interpretative\" choreography and regarded the video as a whole \"a visual representation of Lipa's internal struggle with herself.\" The Staff for Promotion Music News commended the video for \"perfectly [encapsulating] those struggles that one faces during a breakup,\" and for ending on a positive note. In his review for Idolator, Mike Wass called the video \"emo\" and \"striking,\" while Mar Maldonado of Soundigest viewed it as \"unique\" and \"visually appealing.\" ==Live performances== Lipa performed \"IDGAF\" for the first time on 23 June at the Glastonbury Festival 2017.
