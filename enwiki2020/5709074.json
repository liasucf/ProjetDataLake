As a major league rookie in 1977, he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated That season at Yankee Stadium, Wills and Ranger teammate Toby Harrah hit back-to-back inside-the-park home runs on Saturday, only the second time this feat has ever occurred in a major league game, and the only time on consecutive pitches. Harrah's came on a drive to the right- center field gap; on the play, Yankee outfielder Lou Piniella hit the wall and was injured. By the time another player was able to retrieve the ball, Harrah was being waved home. Wills' HR came on a drive to center field over the head of Mickey Rivers; both were off reliever Ken Clay. Earlier that year at spring training in Florida, Wills controversially replaced Lenny Randle at second base, which led to Randle's punching Rangers manager Frank Lucchesi in the face, sending him to the hospital with a facial fracture.The Official Site of The Texas Rangers: News: Swapping stories: The '77 Randle trade In 1978, Wills stole 52 bases, breaking Dave Nelson's single-season franchise record of 51 in ; the number remains a Ranger record for stolen bases in a season.
