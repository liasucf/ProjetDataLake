    "text": "Im or Lim is a common Korean family name. Korea borrowed Chinese characters and wrote its last name. It is unclear whether it is the origin of the same family. According to the initial law of the Korean language, it is sometimes written in English as \"Lim.\" ==History== The first clan branch is the Supul Rim (\uc218\ud480 \ub9bc, meaning \"Forest-Rim\") and its Hanja character is \u6797. The Supul Rim or Lim or Im branch consists of two large clan houses; the first is Naju (early Hoijin) and the second, which is the elder branch is Pyeongtaek. Members of this branch often write their names as both \uc784 (Im; more common) and \ub9bc (Rim or Lim; initial law). The character \u6797 means \"forest\". The second clan branch is the Matgil Im (\ub9e1\uae38 \uc784) or Mateul Im (\ub9e1\uc744 \uc784) and its Hanja character is \u4efb. The Matgil Im/Mateul Im branch consists of one large clan house called Pungcheon Im clan and a smaller clan house called Jangheung (\uc7a5\ud765). Members of this clan branch both write and pronounce their names as \uc784 (Im). The character \u4efb means \"trusted/to bear, duty\". ==Romanization== When \u6797 (\ub9bc or \uc784) is romanized, it is spelled as \"Rim\" or \"Im\" in McCune\u2013Reischauer and Revised Romanization of Korean, or sometimes as \"Lim\". When \u4efb (\uc784) is romanized, it is spelled as \"Im\" in McCune\u2013Reischauer and Revised Romanization of Korean, or sometimes spelled \"Yim\". Statistics from the year 2000 show that there were 762,767 \uc218\ud480 \ub9bc (\u6797, Rim) and 172,726 \ub9e1\uae38 \uc784 (\u4efb, Im) in South Korea. ==Notable people== *Dami Im, Australian-Korean singer and songwriter *Im Chang-kyun, stage name I.M, South Korean rapper, member of Monsta X *Im Chang-jung, South Korean actor and singer *Im Dong-hyun, South Korean archer *Im Gyeong-eop, general in the Joseon Dynasty instrumental in protecting Korea from Manchu invasion *Im Jin-ah, stage name Nana, South Korean singer, member of After School *Im Kwon-taek, South Korean film director *Im Na-yeon, South Korean singer, member of Twice *Im Sang-soo, South Korean film director *Im Se-mi, South Korean actress *Im Si-wan, South Korean singer and actor, member of ZE:A *Im So-eun, stage name NC.A, South Korean singer *Im Soo-hyang, South Korean actress *Im Soo-jung, South Korean actress *Im Sung-han, South Korean television screenwriter *Im Tae-bin (also known as Im Danny), Korean-American singer from 1TYM *Im Yeo-jin, South Korean singer, member of Loona *Im Yoon- ah, South Korean singer and actress, member of Girls' Generation *Im Youngmin, former Produce 101 Season 2 contestant, member of MXM *Lim Hyung-joo, South Korean Operatic Pop(Popera) Singer *Lim Chang-yong, South Korean baseball pitcher *Dong-Hyek Lim, South Korean classical pianist *Lim Dong-won, retired South Korean politician *Lim Eun-ji, South Korean pole vaulter *Lim Hyo-jun, South Korean short track speed skater, Olympic gold medalist *Lim Jae-beom, stage name JB, South Korean singer and actor, member of Got7 *Lim Hyunsik, South Korean singer, member of BtoB *Lim Je, pen name \"Paekho,\" poet of the Joseon Dynasty *Lim Jeong-hee, South Korean singer *Lim Jeong-hyun, South Korean amateur guitarist that found worldwide fame through YouTube.com *Lim Ju-hwan, South Korean actor. *Lim Na-young, South Korean singer, member of South Korean girl groups I.O.I and Pristin *Lim Se-jun, South Korean singer, member of Victon *Lim Seulong, South Korean singer and actor, member of 2AM *Lim Sungbin, known as Beenzino, a South Korean musician *Lim Yo-hwan, South Korean professional StarCraft player *Rhim Ju-yeon, South Korean comics writer *Rim Jong-sim, North Korean Olympic weightlifter *Yim Bang-eun, South Korean badminton player *Yim Soon-rye, South Korean film director *Yim Sung-ah, South Korean professional golfer *Lim Young-woong, South Korean trot singer ==See also== *List of Korean family names ==References== Category:Korean-language surnames ",
