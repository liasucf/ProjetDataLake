    "text": "Bahimiron was an American black metal band based in Houston, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona, United States. It was formed by vocalist and guitarist David \"Grimlord\" Herrera in 2001, after leaving the death metal band Imprecation in 1993. Other members of the band included bassist Jenoside and drummer Blaash, who would play in the band from its formation until its dissolution, and second guitarist Luna, who joined Bahimiron in 2013. The band was best known for their second album, Southern Nihilizm, released in 2008. After thirteen years of activity, Bahimiron split-up in 2014. Bahimiron's style has been labeled as black metal and war metal. Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy described their sound as \"Beherit, Absu, and Gorgoroth in a dusty southern bar brawl\". Blabbermouth.net's Scott Alisoglu stated that the band plays \"Texas style of dangerously hot black metal that offer one images of decomposing bodies baking in 105-degree temperatures, no doubt the victims of ritual sacrifice.\" ==Members== ===Final line-up=== * Grimlord (David Herrera) \u2013 vocals, guitar (2001-2014) * Jenoside - bass (2001-2014) * Blaash - drums, percussions (2001-2014) (died 2017) * Luna (Milton Luna) - guitar (2013-2014) ===Former members=== * Krag - guitar (2001-2013) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Pure Negativism: In Allegiance with Self Wreckage (2006) * Southern Nihilizm (2008) * Rebel Hymns of Left Handed Terror (2011) ===EPs and splits=== * Hunting Down the Weak (2004) * As the Sun Burns (2004) * Pact in Dizease & Profanation (2006) * Sargeist / Bahimiron (2006) * Last of the Confederates (2009) ===Demos=== * Funeral Black (2002) * Terror Division Bloodstrike (2003) * Xrist Gutzlice (2004) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:American black metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Texas Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Arizona Category:Musical groups from Houston Category:Musical groups from Phoenix, Arizona Category:Musical quartets Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2014 ",
