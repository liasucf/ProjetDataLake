    "text": "\"The Hour of Death\" is the 10th episode of the supernatural drama television series Grimm of season 2 and the 32nd overall, which premiered on November 2, 2012, on NBC. The episode was written by Sean Calder, and was directed by Peter Werner. ==Plot== Opening quote: \"And branded upon the beast, the mark of his kin. For none shall live whom they have seen.\" Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) have been investigating the kidnapping of a girl named Donna Reynolds. They have a suspect, Adrian Zayne (Michael Maize). They question him but he panics, woges into a Schakal and attempts to escape but Nick and Hank apprehend him. As they lack evidence, Zayne is released and Nick threatens him as a Grimm. Nick sneaks into his house in an attempt to find evidence and stumbles upon Hank, who was also looking for evidence. They discover Zayne's corpse hanging with symbols marked on his body. The police arrives and Wu (Reggie Lee) tells them that Zayne confessed to the kidnapping and Donna was saved. While the TV makes a report, the symbols cause shock to Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Bud (Danny Bruno). Monroe explains that the symbols means the Endezeichen Grimms, these Grimms have no heart and kill any Wesen in their path. As Nick is the only known Grimm in Portland, the Wesen will confuse him as the killer. Renard (Sasha Roiz) meets with Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) to discuss Nick and after it seems that they unintentionally flirt, she leaves. A video showing Zayne's torture before dying is uploaded on internet and the police identify one of the vans belonging to Richard Berna (Michael Patten), a friend of Zayne. They arrest him but he is worried that Nick would kill him, confusing him as the Endezeichen Grimm. He is somehow released and the police raid his house to discover his corpse. He is then taunted by the Endezeichen Grimm on the phone. They find out that Ryan (Michael Grant Terry) let Richard go and he went after Bud. Nick and Hank discover that Ryan has been stalking Nick. Nick and Hank locate Bud in a warehouse while Nick chases Ryan. Ryan confronts him for his methods of interacting and being friends with Wesen. Ryan struggles with control of his Lebensauger side and Nick arrests him. Renard visits Juliette and after some tension, they kiss. Juliette finds out it was he who kissed her in the hospital and they kiss again. Juliette then slams the door in his face, confused. ==Reception== ===Viewers=== The episode was viewed by 5.64 million people, earning a 1.8/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Last Man Standing, Shark Tank and Malibu Country.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \"B+\" grade and wrote, \"When Ryan the intern showed up a few weeks ago, it was unclear exactly what purpose he would serve. His entrance was highlighted to designate him as important, but then he lingered in the background for several weeks, knocking over a water cooler, enduring Sgt. Wu's mockery \u2014 and if the show had kept up that long con any longer, it would've been frustrating to waste that kind of screen time. But even though I saw the twist coming a few scenes before it happened, I never expected Grimm to take the turn it did, in one deft move revealing Ryan to be a formidable villain for an episode. This is Grimm at its darkest and most in tune with how to blend Nick's responsibilities as a cop with his hidden identity as a Grimm, and even with a handful of quibbles, it makes for a gripping procedural.\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \"Oh, boy, Grimm, way to get so... grim. In what may be the show's darkest episode yet, Nick learns more than he probably wanted to about his ancestry, and things heat up between Juliette and Renard.\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \"I've had my suspicions about Ryan ever since he mentioned taking an interest in Nick's cases, but I wasn't expecting this. 'The Hour of Death' once again played with Grimms always-present theme of not judging a book by its cover, bringing about some very interesting developments along the way.\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \"I liked all the writing tweaks found here, but I kind of wish that we had spent more time with Ryan and had him become more of a person before pulling a reveal like this.\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \"It was also a relief to find out Intern Ryan's deal, though it would have been nice to spend more time getting to know him as a person, not just a recurring gag, before his big reveal. Imagine if Ryan had been introduced at the beginning of the season, grown into our favorite new Portland PD addition, and then we found out his secret! Still, 'The Hour of Death' created quite the complicated character, one we can't help but pity. Let's cross our fingers for more suicidal Intern Ryan next week (or at least for learning what the heck he is).\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Grimm (season 2) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ",
