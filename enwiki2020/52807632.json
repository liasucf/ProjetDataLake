    "text": "Basic is an unincorporated community in Clarke County, Mississippi, United States. ==History== Basic is located on the former Mobile and Ohio Railroad and was once home to two sawmills and two general stores. A post office called Basic was established in 1900, and remained in operation until 1945. A variant name was \"Basic City\". The origin of the name \"Basic\" is obscure. In South and West: From a Notebook, Joan Didion notes that when she visited the town in the 1970s, it was \"not on the map.\" A member of the Tallahatta Formation known as Basic City Shale is named for Basic. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Clarke County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi ",
