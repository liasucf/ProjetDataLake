Completed in 2000, it is located in the East, along Pasir Ris Drive 3. it can be recognized by its outstanding blue dome and modern yet Islamic architecture. The mosque, which can accommodate a congregation of 3,300 people offers madrasah and kindergarten classes. It is a hive of activities during the evening when religious classes open its doors to Muslims in the vicinity. The mosque is wheelchair accessible as there are ramps and a lift that serves all floors. The mosque is fully air conditioned in all of the prayer halls. As the number of Muslims in the neighbourhood increases, the mosque is overcrowded due to the high demand during peak periods such as Friday prayers and Ramadan night prayers. On the 27 January 2017, the Masjid Al-Istighfar opened a new temporary prayer facility located opposite the mosque. This is to cater to the large number of Muslim worshippers for its Friday prayers. The temporary prayer facility, which can house 500 worshippers, is a sheltered structure with large fans hanging from its ceiling. It is about 15m across the road from the mosque. To be scheduled to be completed by end-December 2018, overflow prayer spaces are built to meet with the ever increasing worshippers every Fridays. These overflow spaces are tiled with rows where worshippers can pray accordingly. Large fans are installed on the metal roof so worshippers can pray comfortably. Additionally, ablution spaces are built along the perimeter of the upgraded mosque. This brings the total capacity of the mosque combined with the temporary prayer facility to more than 3,800 worshippers. The mosque will be redeveloped in the near future according to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) ==Transportation== The mosque is accessible from Pasir Ris MRT station by transferring to bus services 5, 6 & 89\\. ==See also== * Masjid Darul Ghufran * Islam in Singapore * List of mosques in Singapore ==References== == External links == * *Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, MUIS (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore) *List of Mosques in Singapore managed by MUIS : Masjid Al-Istighfar Category:1999 establishments in Singapore Category:Mosques completed in 1999 Istighfar Category:Pasir Ris ",
