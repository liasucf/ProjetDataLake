    "text": "Constantin Dumitrescu (February 25, 1868 \u2013 January 24, 1935) was a Romanian major general. Born in Morunglav, Romana\u021bi County in 1868, his parents were Dumitrache and Nicoli\u021ba Ioan; the surname Dumitrescu was adopted later. His father was possibly of Greek origin. The future general was nicknamed \u201cTurcu\u201d (\u201cthe Turk\u201d) because he was intransigent and did not accept to be contradicted. In 1887, he entered the school for soldiers\u2019 sons in Craiova, entering the officers\u2019 school in 1890. He graduated in 1892 as a second lieutenant. The same year, he was assigned to the Rovine Regiment, serving there until 1896, when he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1897, he married Elena D\u0103buleanu. His regimental service was interrupted in 1900\u20131901, when he was assigned to the soldiers\u2019 sons\u2019 school. In 1904, he became a captain, and was promoted to major in 1911, and to lieutenant colonel in early 1916. Soon after Romania's entry into World War I he fought with bravery in September 2016 at the Battle of Turtucaia, and in October at the First Battle of the Jiu Valley. He was promoted to colonel afterward, and in September 1917, he was named brigadier general and put in command of the 22nd Infantry Brigade. Romanian Army operations in the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War in April 1919 Dumitrescu played an important role in the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War. On April 18, 1919, he was appointed commanding officer of the 7th Division, replacing General . Starting a few days earlier from its positions around Zal\u0103u, the 7th Division attacked towards Carei and Oradea, then occupied Debrecen, after which it marched on to Karcag and Tiszaf\u00fcred. On July 19, General Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu, the commander of the Romanian Army in Transylvania, put Dumitrescu in charge of the front line in the Madaras sector. Together with the forces of Generals (in charge of the Fegyvernek sector) and Traian Mo\u0219oiu (in charge of the T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s sector), Dumitrescu's troops crossed the Tisza River at Kisk\u00f6re on July 31, and eventually reached Budapest at the beginning of August. In October 1920 Dumitrescu was put in command of the 11th Division. Named major general in March 1924, he assumed the next month command of the 1st Army Corps. He entered the reserves in October 1929, and died in Craiova in 1935. His awards include the Order of the Crown (1910, 1919, 1924, the latter of the grand officer rank), the Order of the Star of Romania (1917, 1922, 1928, the latter of the grand officer rank) and the Czechoslovak War Cross 1918 (1928). ==Notes== Category:1868 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Olt County Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian Army World War I generals Category:Romanian people of the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War Category:Grand Officers of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Grand Officers of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross ",
