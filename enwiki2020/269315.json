It covers an area of 6,674 km2 unfolded in the contact zone of three representative natural units: Apuseni Mountains, Some\u0219 Plateau and Transylvanian Plain. Cluj County is the 12th largest in the country and occupies 2.8% of Romania's area. It is bordered to the northeast with Maramure\u0219 and Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud counties, to the east with Mure\u0219 County, to the south with Alba County, and to the west with Bihor and S\u0103laj counties. === Relief === Turda Gorge Pietrele Albe, Vl\u0103deasa Massif The relief is rugged, constituted mostly of hilly units belonging to Some\u0219 Plateau and, to a lesser extent, of mountain portions that represent the northeastern part of Apuseni Mountains. Fields are missing on the territory of Cluj County, being replaced, as step of relief, by well developed terraces and floodplains in the lower sectors of Some\u0219ul Mic and Arie\u0219 rivers. The hilly area, extended in the central northern and southern part of the county, include several subunits of Some\u0219 Plateau (Cluj, Feleacu, Dej hills), among which are individualized numerous depressions (Apahida, Bon\u021bida, Gil\u0103u, Dej, Turda, C\u00e2mpia Turzii) at the edge of which there are some contact depressions (Huedin and Iara), at the limit of the mountain. The mountain sector, located in southwest, belongs to Apuseni, mountains group of Western Carpathians, represented by sectors of Vl\u0103deasa Massif (peak Vl\u0103deasa \u2013 1,836 m), Gil\u0103u Mountains and Muntele Mare, as well as narrow portions of Trasc\u0103u, Plopi\u0219, Mese\u0219 and Bihor mountains. In the eastern part of Cluj County, east of the river alignment Valea Florilor\u2013Maraloiu\u2013Some\u0219ul Mic, is located a part of the Hilly Plain of Transylvania, special unit of relief, with mountainous character, partially overlapped by some gas-condensate domes. === Hydrographic network === Some\u0219ul Mic in Cluj-Napoca The hydrographic network is represented by rivers (Some\u0219ul Mic with SW\u2013NE direction, whose catchment area is fully developed on the territory of Cluj County, Cri\u0219ul Repede and lower Arie\u0219), natural lakes and ponds (C\u0103tina Popii I and II, Geaca, \u021aaga, etc.) and lakes of hydropower interest (Beli\u0219-F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele, Tarni\u021ba and Gil\u0103u). In the northeastern part of Cluj County, Some\u0219ul Mic joins Some\u0219ul Mare, upstream of Dej, forming the Some\u0219, which flows into the Tisza to the west. The deep waters are less represented and are characterized by high mineralization. Relatively rich mineral springs, with sulphates, calcium and sodium chloride, can be found in Dezmir, Cojocna, G\u0103d\u0103lin, Sic, Gherla, Leghia, Some\u0219eni, Turda, etc. === Climate === Through its location, Cluj County benefits from a moderate continental climate. In the mountain sector (Vl\u0103deasa Massif and Muntele Mare), mean annual air temperature is 2 \u00b0C, and in the rest of the territory is 6 \u00b0C. Annual thermal amplitudes have values between 17\u201319 \u00b0C in the mountains and grow at 23\u201325 \u00b0C in hilly areas, plateaus and plains. Rainfall is distributed unevenly, with minimal amounts in Turda\u2013C\u00e2mpia Turzii (about 550 mm) and maximum in Vl\u0103deasa Massif (about 1,400 mm). On average, annual values of rainfall reach 600\u2013650 mm in the Transylvania Plain, 650\u2013700 mm in the Some\u0219 Plateau and over 900\u20131000 mm in mountainous areas. === Natural resources === Turda salt mine. The geological reserve is estimated at 38,750 million tonnes of salt. Cluj County has rich and varied natural resources. Iron ores came into use in 1962, by exploitations in C\u0103pu\u0219u Mic and B\u0103i\u0219oara, being conducted over the years a series of geological explorations in Vlaha, S\u0103v\u0103disla and Cacova Ierii. Fossil fuels are represented by brown coal exploited in Ticu\u2013D\u00e2ncu\u2013B\u0103gara area and peat, exploited in C\u0103l\u0103\u021bele\u2013C\u0103p\u0103\u021b\u00e2na sector. Likewise, there is a gas-condensed dome in Puini in the Transylvanian Plain. Besides iron ore and mineral fuels, there is a variety of useful minerals and rocks, including: quartz in Muntele Mare and around Some\u0219u Rece (where can also be found feldspar), dacites and andesites in Vl\u0103deasa Massif and around Morlaca, Bologa, Poieni, S\u0103cuieu, Stolna and Iara, granites in Muntele Mare, limestones and dolomites used to fabricate binders (lime, cement), exploited in S\u0103ndule\u0219ti, Tureni, Surduc, Buru, Poieni, etc., calcareous tuffs of high quality with quarries at Tioc\u2013Corne\u0219ti, kaolin sands at Pope\u0219ti, Topa, B\u0103gara, G\u00e2rb\u0103u, etc., salt, with significant reserves at Ocna Dejului, Turda, Cojocna, Sic, Nire\u0219, gravel pits on Some\u0219ul Mic at Gil\u0103u, Flore\u0219ti and on lower Arie\u0219. === Vegetation === Thickets of Sic The vegetation is heterogeneous and storeyed due to the prevalence of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met a wide range of plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vl\u0103deasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and juniper bushes. The spruce forests floor, expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000\u20131,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with fir, and the deciduous forests floor develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400\u20131,000 m, and consists of sessile forests mixed with beech, hornbeam or elm. On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, ash and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests. === Fauna === The fauna is adapted to vegetation flooring, but less constant to its limits, due to great mobility; it is rich in species. In forests are present numerous animals of cynegetic interest, including deer, stag, bear, fox, lynx, wild boar, squirrel, and on Some\u0219 Valley naturally entered the muskrat. Around artificial lakes live a series of birds (duck, coot, stork), in the Some\u0219 Plateau and Transylvanian Plain was colonized the pheasant, and in Turda Gorge area lives the rock eagle. Mountain rivers are populated with trouts, graylings and nases, and in the lower ones with barbel and chub. == Economy == Cluj has, after Bucharest, the largest number of companies in the country (over 32,000 firms in 2014) and ranks third after net average earning, with 1,890 lei in December 2013 (Bucharest has 2,474 lei, and Ilfov 2,138 lei); it is almost 5% higher than the national average. Great investors in automotive industry, but also in IT have increased the average salary of employees, but these wage increases have led to an increase in the cost of living, reflected, for example, through higher rents than in surrounding counties.

After reorganized and renamed to Cluj County, its territory included all of the current Cluj County, and some of the communes now in S\u0103laj County and Mure\u0219 County. It was bordered on the north by the counties of S\u0103laj, Some\u0219, and N\u0103s\u0103ud, on the west by Bihor County, on the south by Turda County, and to the east by Mure\u0219 County. ===History=== The territory of the county was transferred in 1920 from the Kingdom of Hungary, as successor state to Austria-Hungary, to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. Thus, Cluj County was the successor to the former Hungarian administrative unit of Kolozs County (). Until the year 1925 it was called Cojocna County (). In Hungarian, the town of Cojocna is called \"Kolozs\", so it was a rough equivalent of the prior Hungarian name. Cojocna County's headquarters were in Cluj, but Cluj enjoyed the status of a free city. In 1925, the autonomous status of Cluj was abolished, and the free city was merged with the county of Cojocna, which was renamed Cluj County. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Cluj County became part of \u021ainutul Cri\u0219uri. In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. The parts of the county that remained under Romanian administration (the south of the county, including Feleacu, were united with Turda County and became Cluj-Turda County. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. ===Administration=== Map of Cluj County as constituted in 1938. As of 1925, the county had an area of 5,079 km\u00b2 and a population of 352,029 inhabitants, consisted of 226 rural communes (equivalent to today's villages), and one urban commune (the city of Cluj), and was administratively subdivided into twelve districts (pl\u0103\u1e63i):\"Minerva.
