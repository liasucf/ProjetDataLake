    "text": "High is the second extended play (EP) by Australian alternative pop singer- songwriter and producer Jarryd James. The EP was released on 29 July 2016 and debuted and peaked at no. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart. James collaborated with many sought-after producers, including long-time collaborator Joel Little, Mikky Ekko, Tobias Jesso Jr and Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel. Upon release of the EP, James explained his songwriting; \"I tend to only focus on the melodies and whatever happens instrumentally is just what feels right. I also don't come in with words already written, I like to form lyrics, let them be informed by the vibe of the music.\" James will promote the album in the United States throughout August and September 2016. ==Reception== Jessica Mule from Renowned for Sound gave the EP 4 stars out of 5, saying: \"High simmers and stirs with its electro-R&B; influence. Each of the six tracks on the EP stands on their own with its own emotional fingerprint.\" AAA Backstage gave the EP 3.5 out of 5 saying' \"Although edgy at times, the EP features a timbre that feels familiar yet somehow vague at the same time. The tracks attempt to showcase a variety of vibes and certainly do justice to James\u2019 excellent, if not sometimes wispy, vocals. Arguably lacking in wow-power, the EP delivers a polished version of exactly what we expected. It\u2019s all about a rhythmic simplicity that hones in on lyrical memos, which is by no means a bad thing.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2016 EPs Category:Indie pop EPs Category:EPs by Australian artists ",
