    "text": "Frank Sinatra & the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra is a 1998 compilation album by the American singer Frank Sinatra. The three-CD set contains recordings from Sinatra's performances with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra at the beginning of his five-decade singing career. Many of the songs had never been available prior to the set, as Sinatra did not record them for his studio albums when he was alive. They had, however, been available as transfers from 78rpm on vinyl in the six-LP box set The Dorsey/Sinatra Sessions, compiled by Alan Dell for RCA/Victor records, set SD 1000, issued in 1982, accompanied by a leaflet including full discography.
