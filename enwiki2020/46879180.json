Due to a reported signing bonus demand of \"more than $2 million\", Everett was not selected until the Milwaukee Brewers chose him in the 29th round, with the 871st overall selection. Everett turned down signing bonus offers reportedly as high as $2.5 million from teams who decided against drafting him so that he could attend Vanderbilt. Everett missed the first half of his freshman season with an injury. When he returned, he pitched to a 1.50 ERA in 12 innings pitched. == Death == Everett went fishing at Normandy Lake in Manchester, Tennessee, with Vanderbilt teammates on the night of June 2, 2016.
