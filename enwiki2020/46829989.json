He played college football at Wagner College. ==Early years== Williams started out his high school football career at Bridgeton High School, idolizing former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, and dreaming of following in his footsteps on defense. After starting his first 2 seasons at middle linebacker for Bridgeton High, Williams officially switched to running back his junior year, piling up 2,786 yards over his final 2 seasons. As a senior, he rushed for 1,321 yards on 216 carries (average of 6.2 yards per carry) with a long of 52 yards and eight touchdowns. He spent a year after high school prepping at Milford Academy in New Berlin, New York Williams was also a standout in track & field at Bridgeton. In 2007, he got a top-throw of 16.52 meters (54 feet, 2 inches) in the shot put at the South Jersey Invitational. As a senior, he recorded a personal-best time of 8.38 seconds in the 55m hurdles at the 2008 NJSIAA Sectional Meet. He finished first in the javelin at the Cape-Atlantic League Championship with a personal- best throw of 52.3 meters (171 feet, 6 inches). He also got personal-bests of 14.94 seconds in the 110m hurdles and 42.95 meters (140 feet, 9 inches) in the discus at the NJSIAA State Meet. Williams drew no interest from major universities coming out of high school. However, after transferring to Milford Academy, he drew interest from many Division I-A and I-AA colleges, with the University of Iowa being one of the main schools. After taking an official visit to Iowa, he was later informed that they were not going to offer him a full scholarship. Then, Wagner College called Williams the next day offering a partial scholarship and his family encouraged him to take the offer from Wagner. ==College career== Williams ended his career at Wagner College ranked third all-time in the school's history in both rushing yards (4,435) and scoring (276 points).
