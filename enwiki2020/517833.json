A funbox may also include other elements that allow for more complicated skateboarding tricks.Skateboarding Skills: The Rider's Guide by Ben Powell (Firefly Books, 2008) Like other skatepark features, funboxes are used by skateboarders, inline-skaters and BMX-riders. ==Features== Table-top - The main characteristic of a funbox is the standard table-top; the flat top of the main structural box component. The table-top can vary in height and surface area. Ramps - To allow access to the table-top, a funbox will generally be surrounded (on two or more sides) by ramps or stairs to allow tricks or transitions on, off or over the table-top. Other elements - A funbox may also include a number of other elements including ledges, rails, spines, copings, angled ramps, wall sections to allow \"wallrides\" and improvised street furniture pieces.Street Skating: Grinds and Grabs by Jeff Savage (Capstone, 2004) A funbox with ramps on opposite sides may allow for the conduct of aerial tricks. As such, funboxes are commonly placed in line with the \"outlet\" of a larger ramp to allow for a build-up of speed. Typically, a funbox with ramps or transitions on all sides of the table will be placed in the middle of a park. ==Construction== Funboxes are generally constructed of concrete (as a permanent element in a skatepark) or wood (as a moveable or customizable element for street skateboarding). Some variations include steel frames and both concrete and wood constructions will often include steel copings or rails. Some funboxes will be constructed in sections to allow for further customization.Ramp Plans: Learn How to Build Vert Street Mini Launch and Bowls (2000 Edition) (High Speed Productions, 1999) [released by Thrasher magazine] The construction must resist dynamic structural load resulting from aerial tricks or jumps onto the funbox. ==References== Category:Skateboarding Category:Skateboarding equipment ",
