    "text": "Wild Angels is the third studio album by American country music artist Martina McBride. The album produced the singles \"Safe in the Arms of Love\", \"Wild Angels\", \"Swingin' Doors\", \"Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town\", and \"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\". \"Wild Angels\" was McBride's first number one hit on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The album was certified Gold on February 23, 1996, and Platinum on February 6, 1998, by the RIAA. Also included on this album is a cover of \"Two More Bottles of Wine\", which was previously a #1 hit for Emmylou Harris in 1978. \"Safe in the Arms of Love\" was originally recorded by Wild Choir on their self-titled 1986 album, Baillie & the Boys on their 1989 album Turn the Tide, Kennedy Rose on their 1994 album Walk the Line, and Michelle Wright on her 1994 album The Reasons Why. Wright's version of the song was a Top 10 hit in Canada. \"A Great Disguise\" would later be recorded by Pam Tillis on her 1998 album Every Time. This was McBride's last album to feature a neotraditional country sound before developing a more crossover-friendly country-pop sound. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Compiled from liner notes. ;Musicians * Eddie Bayers - drums (tracks 2-4 & 10) * Dennis Burnside - string arrangements (tracks 10 & 11) * Larry Byrom - electric guitar (tracks 5 & 6) * Joe Chemay - bass guitar (all tracks), fretless bass (track 2) * Ashley Cleveland - backing vocals (tracks 1 & 7) * Rusty \"Pedal\" Danmyer - pedal steel guitar (tracks 4 & 7) * Dan Dugmore - electric guitar (tracks 1, 4, 7 & 9), pedal steel guitar (tracks 1 & 8), Dobro (track 11) * Larry Franklin - fiddle (tracks 2, 5 & 9), mandolin (track 5) * Carl Gorodetzky, Pamela Sixfin, Kristin Wilkinson, Robert Mason - strings (tracks 10 & 11) * Vicki Hampton - backing vocals (track 1) * Levon Helm - backing vocals (track 8) * John Hobbs - keyboards (track 1, 2, 4 & 8-11), piano (tracks 3 & 7) * Dann Huff - electric guitar (tracks 1-4, 7, 9 & 10) * Mary Ann Kennedy - backing vocals (track 2) * Larry Marrs - backing vocals (tracks 1, 8, 9 & 11) * Martina McBride - lead vocals (all tracks), tambourine (tracks 1 & 9), backing vocals (tracks 4, 9 & 10) * Steve Nathan - keyboards (tracks 5 & 6) * Russ Pahl - pedal steel guitar (tracks 5 & 6) * Pam Rose - backing vocals (tracks 2 & 10) * Darrell Scott - mandolin (track 2) * Eric Silver - mandolin (track 10) * Harry Stinson - backing vocals (tracks 1, 8 & 11) * Billy Joe Walker Jr. - acoustic guitar (tracks 2-4 & 10) * Biff Watson - acoustic guitar (tracks 1, 5-9 & 11) * Charlie Whitten - pedal steel guitar (track 3) * Dennis Wilson - backing vocals (tracks 3-5) * Lonnie Wilson - drums (tracks 1 & 5-9) * Paul Worley - acoustic guitar (tracks 1, 3-5 & 7-11), high-strung guitar (track 2), electric guitar (tracks 4, 11), six-string bass (track 4) * Curtis Young - backing vocals (tracks 3-5) ;Technical * Jim Burnett - digital editor * Pete Green - overdubbing engineer * Martina McBride - producer * Mike Poole - overdubbing engineer * Mike Psanos - overdubbing engineer * Clarke Schleicher - overdubbing engineer * Ed Seay - producer, engineer, mixing engineer, overdubbing engineer * Paul Worley - producer ==Chart performance== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
