Clar\u00edn, 17 March 2009 ==Origins== The party was formed by Alejandro Biondini in 1990 as the Partido Nacionalista de los Trabajadores (Nationalist Worker's Party), initially as a breakaway from the Justicialist Party.'Kalki y las camisas negras' The party leader anticipated economic crisis in the country which he felt would set up the basis for a takeover by revolutionary nationalism.D. Gatti, 'Cybernetic Neo-Nazis' Biondini is a veteran of the international neo-nazi scene, having established a group called Alerta Nacional in 1984, which he described as 'a small part of the great worldwide socialist movement'. This group has attempted to build links between the country's various extreme right groups.'\"Neo\" Nazismo en Am\u00e9rica Latina' ==Development== The party was re-launched as the New Triumph Party in November 1997, identifying itself as 'the political, militant and electoral expression of Argentine national socialism'. At a time when use of the internet by fringe political groups was limited but growing in popularity the New Triumph Party's online publication Libertad de Opini\u00f3n (Freedom of Opinion) broke new ground in Argentina by providing a regular forum for Argentine neo-Nazism and anti- Semitism. Ricardo Brinzoni was briefly associated with the group as his lawyer Juan Enrique Torres Bande was a member. 'Nuevo Triunfo de Brinzoni' The party has consistently attempted to gain legal recognition but has been rejected. Nonetheless, in the 2005 Argentine legislative election two members of the party, Biondini's wife and son, featured as candidates for Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, a group headed by Jorge Colotto, the general commissioner of the Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina.Carnota, Fernando (1995), El Palacio de la Corrupci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana. ==Ideology== The party supports Neo-Nazism and seeks to use Argentina as the new Nazi base. It has been claimed that Biondini believes that Adolf Hitler had identified Argentina as the future of Nazism. He has claimed that in the final days in the F\u00fchrerbunker Hitler pointed to Argentina on a map and stated that 'from there the new leader will come'. The party has also been vocal in its criticism of the major political parties and leaders, denouncing Fernando de la R\u00faa as a puppet of the Zionist Occupation Government. As part of this rhetoric it also emphasises its grounding in Christianity.Programme of Government ==Platform== The ideas of the party have been summed up by them in declaration of policies which states five aims for the Argentine people. These are listed as: * The reaffirmation of the values of Argentina, based on God and country with a firm stance taken against all who would seek to damage these values. * Dignity for the Argentine worker, through the establishment of a corporatist parliament. * Defence of national sovereignty at all costs, with a systematic programme of rearmament in order to recover the Falkland Islands and Patagonia. * The establishment of a purely Argentine economic system which would eliminate usury and unite classes under corporatism. * A much stricter legal code, including punishments for those it feels have benefitted from Argentina's struggles. ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Flags of the PNT * Interview with Biondini Category:2009 disestablishments in Argentina Category:Antisemitism in Argentina Category:Fascism in Argentina Category:Christian political parties Category:Neo-Nazism in South America Category:Neo-Nazi political parties Category:Political parties established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Argentina Category:Defunct political parties in Argentina Category:Banned far- right parties Category:Political parties disestablished in 2009 Category:Peronist parties and alliances in Argentina Category:Third Position Category:Far-right political parties ",
