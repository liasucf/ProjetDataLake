    "text": "The alveolar or postalveolar clicks are a family of click consonants found only in Africa and in the Damin ritual jargon of Australia. The tongue is more or less concave (depending on the language), and is pulled down rather than back as in the palatal clicks, making a hollower sound than those consonants. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is . The symbol is not an exclamation mark in origin, but rather a vertical bar with a subscript dot, the dot being the old diacritic for retroflex consonants. Prior to 1989, (stretched c) was the IPA letter for the alveolar clicks, and this is still preferred by some phoneticians. The tail of may be the tail of retroflex consonants in the IPA, and thus analogous to the underdot of .Pullum & Ladusaw, Phonetic Symbol Guide, p. 34 Either letter may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks, and increasingly a diacritic is used instead. Common alveolar clicks are: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Trans. I !! Trans. II !! Trans. III !!

The nasal click may also be heard at the right. In the orthographies of individual languages, the letters and digraphs for alveolar clicks may be based on either the vertical bar symbol of the IPA, , or on the Latin of Bantu convention. Nama and most Saan languages use the former; Naro, Sandawe, and Zulu use the latter. ==Features== Features of postalveolar clicks: *The forward place of articulation is alveolar or postalveolar, depending on the language, and apical, which means it is articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge or the roof of the mouth behind the alveolar ridge. (Damin contrasted these two articulations as separate phonemes.) The release is a sharp, plosive sound in southern Africa, but in Sandawe it may be percussive, with the underside of the tip of the tongue striking the floor of the mouth after the release of the click (see below), and in Hadza the release is often quite weak. ==Occurrence== English does not have an alveolar click (or any click consonant, for that matter) as a phoneme, but a plain alveolar click does occur in mimesis, as a sound children use to imitate a horse trotting.Tucker et al.

This allophone has been called \"flapped\" and \"slapped\". Sometimes the percussive slap is louder than the release, resulting in a sound that has been characterized as a \"cluck\". The symbol for the sublingual percussive component is in the extensions to the IPA; a slapped click is therefore transcribed or (or ). The percussive allophones of the five Sandawe alveolar clicks are (or ). Nasal clicks that fit this description are used by speakers of Gan Chinese (from Ningdu county) and of Mandarin (from Beijing and Jilin), and presumably people from other parts of the country, with varying degrees of competence in nursery rhymes for the words for 'goose' and 'duck', both of which begin with in Gan and until recently began with in Mandarin as well. In Gan, the nursery rhyme is (disregarding tone), :' 'a goose in the sky' :' 'a duck on the ground' :' 'a goose lays a goose egg, a goose hatches a goose' :' 'a duck lays a duck egg, a duck hatches a duck' where the onsets are all pronounced .Geoffrey Nathan, 'Clicks in a Chinese Nursery Rhyme', JIPA (2001) 31/2. ==\"Fricated\" alveolar clicks== A series of clicks in Ekoka !Kung have been variously described as retroflex or fricated palatal clicks. ==See also== *Bilabial click *Dental click *Lateral click *Palatal click *Retroflex click *Index of phonetics articles ==References== ==External links== * Category:Alveolar consonants Category:Click consonants ",
