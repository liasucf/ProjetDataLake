He appeared in 80 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n matches over five seasons, scoring a combined ten goals for Real Madrid Castilla, M\u00e1laga, Guadalajara, Recreativo and Lugo. ==Club career== Ernesto was born in Madrid. After unsuccessfully emerging through local Real Madrid's youth ranks (he never made it past the reserves), he went on to represent M\u00e1laga CF, SD Ponferradina and AD Alcorc\u00f3n. On 27 October 2009, with Alcorc\u00f3n, Ernesto scored against his first team in the Copa del Rey, for a final 4\u20130 home rout (4\u20131 on aggregate). With that and his following club, CD Guadalajara, he achieved consecutive promotions to the second division, scoring a combined five goals in the process. Ernesto continued competing in the second level from the 2012\u201313 to the 2014\u201315 seasons, appearing rarely for Recreativo de Huelva and CD Lugo due to injuries and also having a run-in with the latter's coach Quique Seti\u00e9n. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Madrid Category:Spanish footballers Category:Madrilenian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Real Madrid Castilla footballers Category:M\u00e1laga CF players Category:SD Ponferradina players Category:AD Alcorc\u00f3n footballers Category:CD Guadalajara (Spain) footballers Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:CD Lugo players Category:Spain youth international footballers ",
