    "text": "In enzymology, an iodophenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-iodophenol \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-iodophenol methyl ether Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 2-iodophenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 2-iodophenol methyl ether. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2-iodophenol O-methyltransferase. ==References== * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
