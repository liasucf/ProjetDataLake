It is an avatar of Lord Vishnu to fight Lord Sharabha, who in-turn was an avatar of Lord Shiva and had the mission of stopping Narasimha, Vishnu's lion avatar. Berunda, the two headed bird, was unable to overcome Sharabha and eventually Lord Shiva controlled Berunda (Lord Vishnu) and protected the Universe. lord shiva called to be protector of Univese along with Distruction, It was the emblem of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore under the Wodeyar kings, and after India attained independence, it was retained by Mysore state as its emblem. That state was enlarged in 1956 and renamed Karnataka in 1973, and the Gandabherunda continues to be the official state emblem of Karnataka. It is used as the official emblem of the Karnataka state government because it is a symbol of strength. It is believed to be capable of fighting the forces of destruction. It appears as an intricately carved sculpture motif in Hindu temples. ==Depiction== The bird is generally depicted as clutching elephants in its talons and beaks, demonstrating its immense strength. In a coin [Kasu] found in Madurai, it is shown holding a snake in its beak.Ganesh Coins of Tamilnadu, 13.48 All 2-dimensional depictions show a symmetrical image similar to the Double-headed eagle while other images show the long tail feathers resembling a peacock, which is the national bird of India. In the Chennakeshava temple of Belur, Karnataka, Gandaberunda, the two faced bird is carved as a scene of \"chain of destruction\" result in distruction of Universe. The Gandaberunda was later identified as a physical form displayed by Narasimha, Man-Lion incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It's mentioned by several Hindu scriptures. After Lord Narasimha had slain the demon Hiranyakashipu, he clung on to his dreadful form. The Devas were even more afraid of Lord Vishnu than they were of the demon. In order to protect the entire creation, lord Shiva incarnated as Sharabha or Sharabhesvara, a part-lion and part-bird beast. This further angered Lord Narasimha who took the form of Lord Gandaberunda, who fought Sharabha for 18 days.Finaly Gandaberunda stopped by sharaba with the Help of goddess Pratyngira Finaly Universe is protected. http://thepatriot.in/2018/11/29/one- bird-two-heads/ ==Usage== A sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda is found on the roof of the Rameshwara temple in the temple town of Keladi in Shimoga District, the capital of the Keladi Nayakas. The Gandaberunda was also used by the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore as the Royal emblem. The Karnataka Government adopted this symbol as the state symbol and can be found on bus terminals and tickets issued by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation. Coins(Gold pagoda or gadyana) from the rule of Achyuta Deva Raya are thought to be the first to use the Gandaberunda on currency. The crest of the Indian navy ship INS Mysore (D60) features a Gandaberunda. === Emblem === Gandaberunda is the official emblem of Karnataka state government. It was the royal insignia of the erstwhile Mysore kingdom. The Deccan Herald wrote, \"When Dasara completed four hundred years this year, another major feature associated with Mysore kingdom, the royal insignia Gandaberunda quietly celebrated 500th year. The City Herald tried to dig into the roots of the Gandaberunda and stumbled upon some exciting stories associated with it. The Gandaberunda is an imaginary two headed bird. Even five centuries after its first usage in the mints for making coins during the period of Vijayanagar empire around 1510, the Gandaberunda is still flying high as the symbol of seat of power of Karnataka - the official insignia of State. Though the 400th year of Dasara (which was tipped for the most grand celebrations), did not live up to its expectations, the 500th year of adoption of Gandaberunda received a floral celebration, with a 10 foot flower model of the imaginary bird put on display at the Dasara flower show. Historian Professor P V Nanjaraje Urs -- who has widely researched Mysore State -- tells that the Gandaberunda was first used as a sign on coins in Vijayanagar mints, many of which still exist. Since then, the tradition passed on to generations. In mid-16th century, legend says that Yaduraya embarked on a Vijaya Yathra across the Mysore State to consolidate their rank. During the Yathra, an ascetic encountered and gave him a red cloth. The King offered pooja to it and accepted it as a blessing. He won all acclaim thereafter.\" Following his stature raising to new heights, he announced red cloth as Rajdhwaja or State flag. To add the principles of dharma and satya, the flag got a slogan as \"Sathymevodhbhavaramyaham\" with imaginary bird Gandaberunda. The bird was surrounded by elephant headed lion on two sides and a lion carrying Mahishasura\u2019s head on the top.
