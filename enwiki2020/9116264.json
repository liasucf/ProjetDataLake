It is based on the British show Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. The show premiered September 19, 2007. On June 23, 2014, Ramsay announced that he was ending the series; the final episode aired on September 12 that year. In June 2018, Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back, a new series with a premise much like Kitchen Nightmares but a shorter timeline, premiered on Fox. ==Production== The show was produced by ITV Studios America and Optomen, in association with A. Smith & Co. Productions, with Arthur Smith, Kent Weed and Patricia Llewellyn serving as executive producers. In the UK, the series is broadcast under the name Kitchen Nightmares USA and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares USA on Channel 4, which also produced the original UK version. Reruns, along with the British series, are frequently shown on BBC America. == Series overview == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Episodes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired |- ! scope=\"col\" | Season premiere ! scope=\"col\" | Season finale |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#e38181; color:#100; width:10px;\" | | 1 | 10 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#100; width:10px;\" | | 2 | 12 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#e3cd81; color:#100; width:10px;\" | | 3 | 13 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#b4e381; color:#100; width:10px;\" | | 4 | 14 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#81e393; color:#100; width:10px;\" | | 5 | 17 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#6cf; color:#100; width:10px;\"| | 6 | 16 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:darkBlue; color:#100; width:10px;\"| | 7 | 10 | | |} == Episodes == === Season 1 (2007) === The first season focused on restaurants in the southern California and New York City areas. === Season 2 (2008\u201309) === === Season 3 (2010) === The third season was originally scheduled to premiere on Wednesday, January 27, 2010, but it was postponed to Friday, January 29, 2010, due to the State of the Union address. === Season 4 (2011) === In May 2010, the Fox network announced the return of Kitchen Nightmares for a fourth season.

The case was dismissed and went into arbitration. == Reception == Gordon Ramsay in 2010 Ginia Bellafante of the New York Times found Ramsay's teaching methods and high standards \"undeniably hypnotic\" and commented that \"the thrill of watching Mr. Ramsay is in witnessing someone so at peace with his own arrogance.\" Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times said the show is \"a very entertaining public service\" that \"will make you laugh, make you sick and make you think\". Randy Cordova of the Arizona Republic found Ramsay \"just as blustery and foul-mouthed here as he is on Hell's Kitchen. But he is also oddly endearing, mainly because he genuinely seems invested in the fate of each restaurant\". Critics have commented that Fox's adaptation of Kitchen Nightmares strayed from the strengths of the original Channel 4 series. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said, \"Leave it to Fox to take something the Brits did pretty well and muck it up\". She added, \"Never mind the cooking; this edition of the show appears to be more interested in playing up the family dramas at the restaurants Ramsay visits\". Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times commented, \"Whereas the British Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares is fundamentally a food show \u2014 it has interesting things to show you about how a restaurant runs and a kitchen works, the wonders of local markets and what you can make from them if you're Gordon Ramsay or willing to follow his instructions \u2014 the Fox edition emphasizes mishap, argument and emotional breakdown almost to the exclusion of cuisine\". == See also == * Bar Rescue * Hotel Hell * Restaurant: Impossible * Restaurant Makeover * Restaurant Stakeout * Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares == Notes == == References == ;General references * * * * == External links == * * * Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings Category:2000s American reality television series Category:2010s American reality television series Category:American television series based on British television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Food reality television series Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Television series by All3Media Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:2000s American workplace television series Category:2010s American workplace television series ",
