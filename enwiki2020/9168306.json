    "text": "Emma Matilda Lake is located in Grand Teton National Park, in the U. S. state of Wyoming. The lake is named after the wife of William O. Owen who was the first, along with three other climbers, to ascend to the summit of Grand Teton in 1898. The natural lake is long and can be reached by way of a 1-mile (1.6 km) hike from a parking area at Two Ocean Lake or via a slightly longer hike from Jackson Lake Lodge. The Emma Matilda Lake Trail circles the lake and offers distant views of the Teton Range.
