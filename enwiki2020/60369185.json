A close cousin of Natasha, Shehryar Aziz is a struggling drama actor. His two friends are Arshad (an aspiring director) and Shabbo. Shehryar is a commitment-phobe and hates it when his mother, Farida brings up the subject of getting him married. At Natasha's wedding, he meets Natasha's cousin, Saniya who has come from Turkey. Shehryar is instantly smitten by her and he tries to flirt with her. At night, he takes Saniya to explore Karachi, the city of lights without informing anyone and the two fall in love. When Shehryar asks for her phone number, she jokes that given his nature, she would give him her phone number and then she would keep waiting for his calls and he will ignore her. She, nevertheless, gives him her number. Shehryar learns from Saniya that she would be leaving in two days and was here to Pakistan to attend Natasha's wedding and to drop her father, Faisal (who is a famous writer) with his family members in his homeland just as he wished. Saniya goes back to Turkey. Farida decides to join the drama industry just to 'pass time' which frustrates Shehryar immensely and in his frustration and his friends teasing him about Saniya, he ignores several calls and texts from her. As he is about to receive her call, he is mugged and Saniya comes to believe that Shehryar has used her. Chapter Two: Rustom's Wedding Faisal writes the script for a drama titled Parey Hut Love and informs Shehryar that he would be cast as the lead. Shehryar is overjoyed but has no one to finance the production of the film. Meanwhile, Farida makes it big in the industry and becomes famous. Rustom, a distant relative of Shehryar who is a Parsi proposes to Tanaaz, his cousin. Shehryar is elated to learn that Saniya has come for the wedding but is heartbroken when Saniya makes him meet her fianc\u00e9, Hassan. She deliberately attempts to make Shehryar jealous by openly praising Hassan. The wedding takes place. Shehryar confronts Saniya after it and tells her that his phone was stolen. Saniya refuses to believe him and tells him that it is too late and that she will not leave Hassan at any cost. Shehryar goes to several producers only to be repeatedly rejected for the script of Parey Hut Love. Shehryar's stepfather (who Shehryar calls 'Half Dad') finances the production. Shehryar for the first time calls him 'dad'. The production of Parey Hut Love begins but Saniya arrives to inform Shehryar of Faisal's increasing brain tumor and gives him the card for her wedding which is to take place in Kashmir, Faisal's hometown. This leads to a major fight between Sheheryar and Arshad who is more focused on his project. Shehryar leaves for Kashmir. Arshad follows him and they reunite. Shehryar tells Saniya that his biological father did not love him at all, even though Shehryar loved him and left him and his mother. Thus, he became a commitment phobe. Chapter Three: Saniya's Wedding Saniya's wedding comes up and Sheheryar falls into depression stemmed from Saniya's rejection. Shehryar begs her to forgive him and marry him, and to leave Hassan but Saniya implies that she can't. Meanwhile, Faisal passes away. The wedding is immediately postponed and Faisal's funeral is arranged. Saniya leaves in the misery caused by her father's death and Shehryar's fierce love for her. Chapter Four: Shehryar's wedding A few years later, Shehryar is a successful actor and is engaged to megastar Zeena, who loves him. Shehryar also reciprocates her feelings but still loves Saniya. Saniya tells Hassan that she is in love with Shehryar and breaks her engagement with him. Hassan forgives her and they continue as friends. Saniya, having learned of Shehryar's wedding (which is to take place in Turkey) from media reports, arrives at the wedding and tells Shehryar that she left Hassan because she told him that she loved someone else. Shehryar's feelings for Saniya rekindle. Zeena realizes Shehryar loves Saniya and not her, after seeing Saniya leave his room. At the wedding, Zeena motivates Shehryar to go after Saniya who was leaving for another city. Shehryar goes after her. Arshad and Shabbo express their liking for each other. Shehryar finds Saniya and tells her that he left Zeena because she found out that he loved someone else.
