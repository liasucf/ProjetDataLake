In 2016, he signed with hometowcn club Bregalnica, where his patience of being mostly a reserve during the first season (two appearances only), paid off, as in the 2016\u201317 season he became a standard first-team player and scored 6 goals in 29 appearances. However, the Macedonian league is formed of just 10 teams, and Bregalnica was relegated as it finished 9th, so Georgiev's boost during the season made it highly improbable for the young talent to play in the second league. In the summer of 2017, he signed with Sileks, a mid-table team. Despite interest of bigger clubs, those were giving priority to experienced players, while Sileks granted him playtime since the very beginning. After another mid-table season, Georgiev enjoyed being a regular and making another consecutive season with 29 league appearances. His position in Sileks grew even stronger in the second season in the club by making 34 league appearances crowned with 8 goals. His performance didn't passed unnoticed, and, despite Sileks avoided relegation at the play-off\u00b4s, Georgiev felt it was time for new greater challenges, and by end of June 2019, he signed with Serbian side Radnik Surdulica.\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043d \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440 \u0432\u043e \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0421\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 at makfudbal.mk, 26-6-2019, retrieved 27-7-2019 Georgiev's signing was soon followed by his compatriot Nikola Bogdanovski, and the joined the already well established Zoran Danoski. Georgiev made his debut for Radnik in a 4\u20130 home victory against Spartak Subotica, scoring two goals.Boban Georgiev at superliga.rs On 2 September 2020, he signed a two-year contract with Bosnian Premier League club Borac Banja Luka. Georgiev made his official debut for Borac nine days later, on 11 September, in a league game against Sarajevo. He scored his first goal for Borac in a cup game against Travnik on 30 September 2020. ==International career== Georgiev made his international debut in 2013 for the Macedonia U17 national team at the 2013 UEFA European Under-17 Championship qualifiers.Boban Georgiev at UEFA.com At the time he hadn't even made his senior debut at club level, but his talent stood up. Afterwards, an option to choose mid-table Macedonian clubs such as Bregalnica or Sileks to gain more playing time, cost Georgiev to sacrifice to fight for the national team spots, which inevitably coaches gave preference to either foreign-based, or big clubs reserves talents. However, his performance in 2017 was impossible to be ignored and he returned to the national team, this time the U21 national team in their 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Metalurg Skopje |2014\u201315 |Macedonian First League |2||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0 |- |rowspan=3|Bregalnica |2015\u201316 |Macedonian First League |2||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Macedonian First League |29||6||3||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||32||7 |- !colspan=2|Total !31!!6!!3!!1!!colspan=2|\u2014!!colspan=2|\u2014!!34!!7 |- |rowspan=3|Sileks |2017\u201318 |Macedonian First League |29||2||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||29||2 |- |2018\u201319 |Macedonian First League |34||8||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||2||37||10 |- !colspan=2|Total !63!!10!!2!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!1!!2!!66!!12 |- |Radnik Surdulica |2019\u201320 |Serbian SuperLiga |17||3||3||2||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||20||5 |- |Borac Banja Luka |2020\u201321 |Bosnian Premier League |5||0||1||1||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||7||1 |- !colspan=3|Career total !118!!19!!9!!4!!2!!0!!1!!2!!130!!25 |} ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from \u0160tip Category:Association football wingers Category:Macedonian footballers Category:North Macedonia youth international footballers Category:FK Metalurg Skopje players Category:FK Bregalnica \u0160tip players Category:FK Sileks players Category:FK Radnik Surdulica players Category:FK Borac Banja Luka players Category:Macedonian First Football League players Category:Serbian SuperLiga players Category:Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina players Category:Macedonian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Serbia Category:Macedonian expatriate sportspeople in Serbia Category:Expatriate footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Macedonian expatriate sportspeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
