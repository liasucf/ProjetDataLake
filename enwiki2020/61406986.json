In 1858 he became Kapellmeister at the Protestant church in Augsburg, St Anne's Church. There he was organizer, choir conductor and composer. In 1866 he founded the Oratorio Society (Oratorienverein Augsburg); this gave subscription concerts of sacred works and orchestral works, and became important in the musical life of the city. In 1873 he founded the Music School in Augsburg (Augsburger Musikschule; it later became the Leopold Mozart Centre). In 1878 he was awarded an honorary degree Doctor of Philosophy at the University of T\u00fcbingen, for his works on the history of music. Schletterer was musically conservative, and opposed to the followers of the music of Richard Wagner. The change in prevailing taste caused his resignation as conductor of the Oratorio Society, not long before his death. He died in Augsburg in 1893. His wife, Hortensia Zirges (a niece of Admiral Karl Rudolf Brommy) died in 1904. ===Works=== Schletterer composed mainly songs, cantatas and choral music.
