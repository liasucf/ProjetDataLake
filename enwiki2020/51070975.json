    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate election in Kentucky will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the Commonwealth of Kentucky, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the United States Senate, elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who has been Senate Majority Leader since 2015 and senator from Kentucky since 1985, is running for reelection to a seventh term in office. He faces off against former U.S. Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath and Libertarian Brad Barron. The Democratic and Republican primaries took place on June 23, 2020. As the primaries neared, the president of the National Bar Association accused officials of carrying out voter suppression. Compared to typical numbers of 3,700, the number of polling stations was reduced to 200 with only one in Louisville. Because a large number of voters voted by mail, absentee ballots were not counted until June 30. Over 973,000 people requested absentee ballots, a far greater number than usual. ==Republican primary== ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== * Mitch McConnell, incumbent U.S. Senator ====Eliminated in primary==== * Nicholas Alsager * Paul John Frangedakis, chiropractor (switched to independent write- in candidacy after losing primary) * Louis Grider, truck driver * Neren James * Kenneth Lowndes * Wesley Morgan, former state representative ====Withdrawn==== * Wendell K.
