Its mission is 'To promote the sustainable supply and use of energy for the greatest benefit of all people'. The idea for the foundation of the Council came from Daniel Nicol Dunlop in the 1920s. He wanted to gather experts from all around the world to discuss current and future energy issues. He organised in 1923 first national committees, which organised the first World Power Conference (WPC) in 1924. 1,700 experts from 40 countries met in London to discuss energy issues. The meeting was a success and the participants decided on July 11, 1924 to establish a permanent organisation named World Power Conference. Dunlop was elected as its first Secretary General. In 1968 the name was changed to World Energy Conference, and in 1989 it became the World Energy Council.Wright, Rebecca; Shin, Hiroki; Trentmann, Frank (2013). From World Power Conference to World Energy Council: 90 Years of Energy Cooperation, 1923 - 2013 (PDF). World Energy Council. p. 8. . Retrieved 24 July 2018. The World Energy Council is the principal impartial network of leaders and practitioners promoting an affordable, stable and environmentally sensitive energy system for the greatest benefit of all. Formed in 1923, the Council is the UN- accreditedhttp://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/acf19b49281081c7852569fa0000ece8?OpenDocument global energy body, representing the entire energy spectrum, with more than 3,000 member organisations located in over 90 countries and drawn from governments, private and state corporations, academia, NGOs and energy-related stakeholders. The World Energy Council informs global, regional and national energy strategies by hosting high-level events, publishing authoritative studies, and working through its extensive member network to facilitate the world\u2019s energy policy dialogue. Today, the Council has Member Committees established in over 90 countries, which represent over 3,000 member organizations including governments, industry and expert institutions. The World Energy Council covers all energy resources and technologies of energy supply and demand. The World Energy Council hosts the World Energy Congress, which is the world's largest and most influential energy event covering all aspects of the energy agenda. Staged every three years, the Congress provides a platform for energy leaders and experts in all aspects of the sector to address the challenges and opportunities facing suppliers and consumers of energy. The 2019 edition took place in Abu Dhabi from 9-12 September, where it was announced that Saint Petersburg will be the host city for the next World Energy Congress in 2022. The World Energy Council's publications include annual releases like the World Energy Trilemma Index, which compares Energy security, equity and environmental sustainability on a country-by-country basis https://www.worldenergy.org/publications/2018/trilemma-report-2018/ (also available as an online tool), as well as Insights Briefs on current energy topics such as Blockchain. == Member Committees == As of March 2019 the World Energy Council has 87 member committees and 2 countries which have direct membershiphttps://www.worldenergy.org/news-and-media/news/vietnam- becomes-the-councils-newest-direct-member/ : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : == World Energy Congresses == # London, 1924 # Berlin, 1930 # Washington, 1936 # London, 1950 # Vienna, 1956 # Melbourne, 1962 # Moscow, 1968 # Bukarest, 1971 # Detroit, 1974 # Istanbul, 1977 # Munich, 1980 # New Delhi, 1983 # Cannes, 1986 # Montreal, 1989 # Madrid, 1992 # Tokyo, 1995 # Houston, 1998 # Buenos Aires, 2001 # Sydney, 2004 # Rome, 2007 # Montreal, 2010 # Daegu, 2013 # Istanbul, 2016 # Abu Dhabi, 2019 == Chairs == *1995\u20131998: John Baker *1998\u20132001: Jim Adam *2001\u20132004: Antonio del Rosario *2004\u20132007: Andr\u00e9 Caill\u00e9 *2007\u20132013: Pierre Gadonneix *2013\u20132016: Marie-Jos\u00e9 Nadeau *2016\u20132019: Younghoon David Kim *2019\u2013present: Jean-Marie Dauger == Secretaries General == *1924\u20131928: Daniel Nicol Dunlop *1928\u20131966: Charles Gray *1966\u20131986: Eric Ruttley *1986\u20131998: Ian Lindsay *1998\u20132008: Gerald Doucet *2008\u20132009: Kieran O'Brian (acting) *2009\u20132019: Christoph Frei *2019\u2013present: Angela Wilkinson == Officers == *JEAN-MARIE DAUGER, Chair *LEONHARD BIRNBAUM, Chair \u2013 Studies Committee *IBRAHIM AL-MUHANNA, Vice Chair \u2013 Special Responsibility Gulf States & Middle East *MATAR AL NEYADI, Vice Chair \u2013 UAE Organizing Committee, World Energy Congress 2019, Abu Dhabi *MIKE HOWARD, Vice Chair \u2013 Special Responsibility for Innovation *KLAUS-DIETER BARBKNECHT, Vice Chair \u2013 Finance *ALEXANDRE PERRA, Vice Chair \u2013 Europe *OLEG BUDARGIN, Vice Chair \u2013 Responsibility for Regional Development *JOS\u00c9 DA COSTA CARVALHO NETO, Chair \u2013 Programme Committee *CLAUDIA CRONENBOLD, Vice Chair \u2013 Latin America&Caribbean; *ROBERT HANF, Vice Chair \u2013 North America *ELHAM IBRAHIM, Vice Chair \u2013 Africa *SHIGERU MURAKI, Vice Chair \u2013 Asia Pacific & South Asia *JOS\u00c9 ANTONIO VARGAS LLERAS, Chair \u2013 Communications & Strategy Committee *YOUNGHOON DAVID KIM, Past Chair ==See also== * Global warming * Greenhouse gas ==References== ==External links== * World Energy Congress Abu Dhabi 2019 * World Energy Congress Istanbul 2016 * World Energy Council website * World Energy Congress Montreal 2010 * World Energy Council - Indicators for Energy Efficiency, Odyssee Program.
