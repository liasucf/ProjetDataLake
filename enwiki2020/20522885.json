Kadam ==History== The 'Ulster' cherry was created through an agricultural breeding program at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1937, and was first introduced in 1964.\u201cCherries from Cornell Cherry Breeding Program,\u201d Cornell University, May 2000 It derives from the crossing of the 'Schmidt' cherry (a mid-season cultivar that produces a dark red, moderately large fruit of a good quality and superior crack resistance) and the 'Lambert' cherry (a heart-shaped cultivar with dark red and moderately firm flesh and a sweet flavor).\u201cCherry Information,\u201d Shangri-La Too Farm\u201cCherry Varieties,\u201d California Cherry Advisory Board The 'Ulster' cherry is named after Ulster County, New York, a region that is home to commercial sweet cherry production.

The dark red fruit is firm and large, sometimes measuring more than one inch in diameter. Its fruit has a strong resistance to cracking brought about by pre- harvest rains, and the trees growing the Ulster cherry have been documented as showing a higher resistance to southwest trunk winter injury, cherry leaf spot and the late spring frosts that can prove fatal to this cultivar . Cracking can be high on some young trees, but the level of cracking declines as the trees mature.\u201cDark Sweet Cherry Varieties,\u201d Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, January 1999 ==Usage== The 'Ulster' cherry\u2019s sweet taste has made it popular in several formats. It can be consumed as freshly picked fruit, and it is also used in canned cherries products.Saveur \u201cA Cherry Gallery,\u201d Saveur Magazine It has also been incorporated into wine production.
