    "text": "A sexton is an officer of a church, congregation, or synagogue charged with the maintenance of its buildings and/or the surrounding graveyard. In smaller places of worship, this office is often combined with that of verger. In larger buildings, such as cathedrals, a team of sextons may be employed. Historically in North America and the United Kingdom the \"sexton\" was sometimes a minor municipal official responsible for overseeing the town graveyard. In the United Kingdom the position still exists today, related to management of the community's graveyard, and the sexton is usually employed by the town/parish or community council. == Origin of the name == The words \"sexton\" and \"sacristan\" both derive from the Medieval Latin word sacristanus meaning \"custodian of sacred objects\". \"Sexton\" represents the popular development of the word via the Old French \"Segrestein\".Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. sexton, sacrist, sacristan, segerstein. It is also referred to in Greek as neokoros. == Duties == Among the traditional duties of the sexton in small parishes was the digging of graves\u2014the gravedigger in Hamlet refers to himself as sexton, for example.Project Gutenberg Hamlet by William Shakespeare Accessed 2007-12-04 In modern times, grave digging and maintenance of the cemetery is usually done by an outside contractor.
