In 1869 it was relocated to the downtown area, and was housed in various business buildings. The library moved throughout the 19th century and early twentieth century, residing in spaces above furniture stores and Odd Fellows Hall. In 1874, E.M. Griswold's store and Post Office hosted the library's collection and services. The Horicon Free Library Association formed in 1899, and in 1926, the Library was provided a municipally-funded space in City Hall located on West Lake Street. When a new City Hall was built in 1957, the library moved with it, and there it resides today. In 1993 the library was moved from an upstairs location to the newly renovated former fire department space adjoining City Hall. Public funding of the library has grown with the collection and needs of the community. $300 was appropriated from the city's coffers in 1900. This funding was nowhere near the quantity needed, and the schools, churches, city band, theatricals and individuals and community groups raised more funds. By 1948, the city provided $1,400 of the library's annual budget, and in 2008 the City of Horicon supplied $196,645 of the $423,896 budget. Fundraising is still necessary to allow for programs at the library, with events such as auctions, raffles, and other activities allowing for the continuing programming initiative.Horicon Library plans Chairity event http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_06969543-565f-50aa-b9c9-49152ef696d5.html, Horicon Library to decorate tree with origami http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_ca9ed34a-847d-5e98-ad3b-462469afa603.html The Friends of the Horicon Public Library were organized in 1987 specifically to raise money for programs and special items, and to provide volunteers for library events.HPL Friends http://www.horicon.lib.wi.us/Friends_HPL.html The small-town evaluation program \"First Impressions,\" a program for community assessment and improvement, in 2009, stated that the Horicon Public Library was \u201coutstanding.\u201dTeams offer ways to make Horicon more attractive http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_dd953e87-4e37-5e56-98b5-736fc2a325ea.html ==Mission== The mission of the library was last revised in 2010 to read: \"Our Mission: To enrich the lives of all our community members with free access to programs, materials and services that empower, educate and inspire.\"Horicon Public Library http://www.horicon.lib.wi.us ==Events== The Horicon Public Library has offered a myriad of programs for all ages, from paranormal research presentationsParanormal team coming to Horicon library http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_b719e173-2258-5989-bbbe- bbd3cf67abf3.html and teen sleepovers,Sleepover funds Horicon library fun http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_54cdfc86-dd75-53f5-8745-0cc691d705ac.html to knitting classesKnitters continue learning and teaching http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_1abbb368-0e55-53e4-bd9b-ed8d3fb8e0de.html and coffee cupping programs by local roasters.Good to the last drop http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_43d9a52e-8bb6-5433-a78d-a95db4a5d0a1.html More traditional programs such as storytimes, book discussions and summer reading programs are also regularly hosted by the library.Horicon Library has big plans http://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/article_4eee8cbb- da0f-51e3-9d04-9ef21307233d.html The Horicon Public Library hosted a program with famous librarian Nancy Pearl in 2005.
