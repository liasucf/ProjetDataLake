    "text": "The 1937\u201338 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei was the fifth edition of Romania's most prestigious football cup competition. The title was won by Rapid Bucure\u0219ti, after they scored 3 goals in a final against CAM Timi\u0219oara. ==Format== The competition is an annual knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn at random. There are no seeds for the draw. The draw also determines which teams will play at home. Each tie is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn after 90 minutes, the game goes in extra time, and if the scored is still tight after 120 minutes, there a replay will be played, usually at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. From the first edition, the teams from Divizia A entered in competition in sixteen finals, rule which remained till today. The format is almost similar with the oldest recognised football tournament in the world FA Cup. http://www.ripensia-sport-magazin.ro/istoria- fotbalului/lista-tuturor-finalelor-cupei-romaniei/ == First round proper == |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|14 November 1937 |} == Second round proper == |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|25 March 1938 |- |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|26 March 1938 |- |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|27 March 1938 |- |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|30 March 1938 \u2014 Replay |- |} == Quarter- finals == |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|1 May 1938 |} == Semi- finals == |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|15 May 1938 |- |colspan=3 style=\"background-color:#FFCCCC;\"|21 May 1938 \u2014 Replay |} Notes: The match between Rapid Bucure\u0219ti and Venus Bucure\u0219ti was contested by both teams and it was replayed. == Final == ==References== == External links == * romaniansoccer.ro Category:Cupa Rom\u00e2niei seasons Cupa Romania ",
