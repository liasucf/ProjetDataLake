CBC Sudbury, October 27, 2014. ==Background== Born and raised in Sudbury, Bigger attended high school at St. Charles College,\"Mayoral profile: Bigger believes in value for money\". Sudbury Star, October 24, 2014. and studied marketing at Cambrian College and commerce at Laurentian University. He is a Chartered Professional Accountant, and worked as an accountant and auditor for Sears Canada and the Regional Municipality of Halton\"Bigger granted leave to run for mayor of Sudbury\". Sudbury Star, August 1, 2014. until he was appointed to a three-year term as the city of Greater Sudbury's auditor general in 2009.\"Auditors serve up savings\". Windsor Star, March 4, 2011. As auditor general, he identified significant waste in the city's management of road maintenance, including scheduling inefficiencies and overbilling by outside contractors, as well as uncovering an illegal practice of paid shift trading taking place among employees of Greater Sudbury Transit. In 2011, Greater Sudbury City Council held an in camera meeting about whether to renew Bigger's contract for a second three-year term;\"Councillors could have faced charges for not co-operating: Ombudsman\". Northern Life, August 30, 2012. during the meetings, they took the unusual step of deciding to hire an outside auditor to audit Bigger's office.\"City Issues: What Sudbury's Mayoral Race Means to the Rest of Ontario\" . The Agenda, October 17, 2014. Bigger's contract was renewed, but several citizens of the city filed a complaint with the Ontario Ombudsman about the closed-door meetings. Ombudsman Andr\u00e9 Marin investigated the matter, ultimately finding that council was within its right to hold a closed meeting as it was a personnel matter involving a city employee, but criticized many of the councillors in his final report for refusing to cooperate with his investigation. As a result of Marin's report, city council voted to reject any oversight from the ombudsman's office. ==Politics== Bigger stated that by summer 2014, he was beginning to consider running for mayor to combat the obstruction he had faced in his role as auditor. In August, he requested a leave of absence from his job as auditor to launch a campaign for mayor. The request was granted. However, council then faced a further controversy when, rather than hiring or contracting a temporary auditor general to continue audit operations during Bigger's leave of absence, it simply suspended the office and reassigned Bigger's assistant, senior auditor Vasu Balakrishnan, to the finance department.\"Ombudsman jabs Sudbury council over auditor general's office\". Northern Life, August 13, 2014. Bigger's campaign for mayor was based on a platform of openness, transparency and accountability.\"Bigger elected mayor in Greater Sudbury\".
