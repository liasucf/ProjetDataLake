    "text": "Abraham Mazel (5 September 1677 \u2013 17 October 1710), was a French Huguenot from the C\u00e9vennes region and camisard revolutionary, known for leading the insurrection that led to the Wars in the C\u00e9vennes (1702-1704), also known as War of the Camisards. == Biography == Abraham Mazel was born to a huguenot family at Saint-Jean-du-Gard, Languedoc, France, on 5 September 1677, to David Mazel (1648-1719), a woolcomber, and Jeanne Daud\u00e9 (1650-1680). In October 1701, Mazel was visited by \"the spirit of prophecy\" urging him to free his fellow huguenots imprisoned by abbot Fran\u00e7ois Langlade, archbishop of the C\u00e9vennes. He was well known in the Cevennes for his brutal repression of french protestants On 24 July 1702, about fifty peasents, led by Mazel and \u00c9sprit S\u00e9guier, marched onto the archpriest's residence at Pont-de-Montvert, to inflict vengeance upon him, and release the imprisioned huguenots. At night, they raided Langlade's residence, first releasing the prisioners from their cells underground, and then set the house on fire. Langlade fell and was injured while trying to flee from a window, and was then finished by the peasants. In 1704, while Jean Cavalier was negotiating peace with field marshal de Villars, leader of the royal troops, others kept on fighting, and among them Abraham Mazel. In January 1705 he was arrested but spared thanks to the help of the parish priest of Saint Martin de Coronac whose life Mazel had formerly spared. On 24 July, 1705, he escaped from the Tour de Constance (Gard) with seventy-six other prisoners. With the guarantee that he would be taken to a foreign country, he surrendered and managed to join up with his friend Elie Marion. With his comrades he went to Geneva and Lausanne where he received an allowance as an officer in the \u201ccamisard regiment\u201d. In November 1705 he took part in the attempted landing of the camisards and Savoyard partisans in Savoie. He sought refuge in England and participated in the \u00ab C\u00e9vennes prophets \u00bb group activities. He felt called to go back to the C\u00e9vennes, where he returned. In March 1709 with Daniel Guy nicknamed \u201cBillard\u201d and Antoine Dupont, he went to the Vivarais region and formed a troop of young men led by Jean Justet de Vals. On June 22 the camisards attacked the Swiss regiment de Courten but the latter withdrew without fighting. On July 8 they were defeated at Leyrisse, where Justet and probably Dupont were killed. The remainder of Mazel\u2019s troops were dispersed at Font-R\u00e9al near Saint-Jean Chambre (Ard\u00e8che). Guy Billard was killed near Vors, but Mazel managed to escape once more. He took refuge in the C\u00e9vennes, met up with lay preachers who were still active, such as Claris, Corteiz and others. He then prepared another armed uprising. On October 17, 1710, he was made prisoner and killed at the Mas de Couteau near Uz\u00e8s (Gard). A commemorative tablet was placed in the Reformed church in Uz\u00e8s, a former Franciscan convent taken by the Reformed in 1791. ==References== Category:French revolutionaries Category:1677 births Category:1710 deaths ",
