    "text": "Sleepwalking is the fifth studio album by Gerry Rafferty, released in 1982. It is the follow-up to the 1980 album Snakes and Ladders. It would be Rafferty's last album for Liberty/United Artists, and his last for six years. Sleepwalking was co-produced by Rafferty and Christopher Neil who went on to become the producer for Mike + The Mechanics. Unlike the previous Rafferty albums such as City to City and Night Owl there is considerable use of synthesisers and drum programming, some of the latter done by Christopher Neil, along with contributions from British session musicians including Hugh Burns, Mo Foster, Liam Genockey, Kenny Craddock, Maurice Pert and Mel Collins. Some tracks also feature members of Dire Straits, keyboardist Alan Clark and drummer Pick Withers; the following year, Rafferty would provide vocals for Dire Straits leader Mark Knopfler's soundtrack to the film Local Hero. The album was reissued as a 2-CD set with Snakes and Ladders by EMI in August 2012. The track \"The Right Moment\" from this album was later recorded by Olivia Newton-John in 1985 for her Soul Kiss album. ==Track listing== All tracks written and arranged by Gerry Rafferty # \"Standing at the Gates\" \u2013 6:51 # \"Good Intentions\" \u2013 4:15 # \"A Change of Heart\" \u2013 4:10 # \"On the Way\" \u2013 4:24 # \"Sleepwalking\" \u2013 3:51 # \"Cat and Mouse\" \u2013 5:03 # \"The Right Moment\" \u2013 3:24 # \"As Wise as a Serpent\" \u2013 5:15 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1982) !align=\"left\"|Position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|80 |- |} ==Personnel== Adapted from Sleepwalking vinyl LP liner notes. *Gerry Rafferty \u2013 lead and backing vocals, keyboards, acoustic guitar (track 8) *Mo Foster \u2013 bass guitar (tracks 1, 3, 4, 8) *Liam Genockey - drums (tracks 1, 3, 5) *Pick Withers \u2013 drums (tracks 4, 6) *Hugh Burns \u2013 electric guitar (tracks 1, 4, 5, 6, 8) *Frank Bogie - electric guitar (track 3) *Alan Clark \u2013 Hammond organ (track 2, 4, 6), piano (tracks 2, 7), synthesizer (track 4, 6, 7) *Christopher Neil \u2013 drum synthesizer (track 2), programming (track 5), backing vocals (tracks 3, 5, 6, 8) *Kenny Craddock \u2013 piano (track 1), Hammond organ (track 1), keyboards (track 5), synthesizer (tracks 1, 3, 8), electric guitar (track 3), banjo (track 8) *Ian Lynn \u2013 synthesizer (tracks 2, 4), sequencer (track 3), string synthesizer (track 7) *Mel Collins \u2013 saxophone (track 1) *Morris Pert \u2013 percussion (tracks 1, 5, 6, 8) *Frank Ricotti - percussion (tracks 4, 6) ;Technical *Nick Ryan \u2013 engineer *Phil Jude, Gered Mankowitz \u2013 photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gerry Rafferty albums Category:1982 albums Category:Albums produced by Christopher Neil Category:United Artists Records albums ",
