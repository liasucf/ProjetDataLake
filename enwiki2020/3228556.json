    "text": "The SPEAR System (an acronym for Spontaneous Protection Enabling Accelerated Response) is a close-quarter protection system that uses a person's reflex action in threatening situations as a basis for defence. The founder, Tony Blauer, developed the SPEAR System in Canada during the 1980s. ==History== The SPEAR System's origin began in 1982 with the developed \"Panic Attack\" drill that attempts to mirror the physiological response of a sudden ambush. The \"Panic Attack\" study developed into the \"Be Your Own Bodyguard\" program and the present day SPEAR and Personal Defense Readiness (\"PDR\") programs. In 2007 UK's Association of Chief Police Officers approved Spear for inclusion in the Personal Safety Training Manual for the British police.Jane's Police Review, issue 150307 2009\"'The United Kingdom Adopts the Blauer Tactical S.P.E.A.R.
