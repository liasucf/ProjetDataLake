    "text": "The Russell Girl is a 2008 television movie directed by Jeff Bleckner. It premiered on the Hallmark Channel on January 27, 2008 and stars Amber Tamblyn as a young medical student who must come to terms with her past. ==Synopsis== Sarah (Amber Tamblyn) is a young woman who has recently discovered that she has leukemia right before she also discovers that she has been accepted to Northwestern University's medical program. She decides to put her school on hold so she can travel back home to tell her parents Gayle (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and Phil (Tim DeKay) about her recent diagnosis. However at the same time Sarah is convinced that this is retribution for a tragic accident that involved her neighbor Lorainne's (Jennifer Ehle) baby. ==Cast== * Amber Tamblyn as Sarah Russell * Jennifer Ehle as Lorainne Morrissey * Henry Czerny as Howard Morrisey * Paul Wesley as Evan Carroll * Tim DeKay as Phil Russell * Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gayle Russell * Daniel Clark as Daniel Russell * Ben Lewis as Jon Morrissey * Max Morrow as Rick Morrissey * Richard Leacock as Dr. Gordon * Richard Fitzpatrick as Ray *Rebecca Dreiling as Karaoke Girl *Max MacBride as Young Jon *William Cuddy as Young Rick *Paula Barrett as Fran ==Reception== Critical reception has been mixed. Variety's Laura Fries wrote \"On paper, writer Jill Blotevogel\u2019s script is standard TV melodrama, but Tamblyn\u2019s deeply expressive performance, along with that of Tony-winner Ehle, creates believably heart-wrenching emotions. \u201cThe Russell Girl\u201d proves Tamblyn can carry a film. Ehle, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Meryl Streep, is as good onscreen as onstage. She went on to offer \"Supporting performances are well done and key to the overall story, especially the father figures eloquently portrayed by DeKay and Henry Czerny. Paul Wesley as Evan, Sarah\u2019s old flame, is a little too good to be true but is a charismatic match to Tamblyn\u2019s Sarah.\" Post Gazette noted the film's focus on the difficulties of reconciliation and forgiveness, and praised the film's acting. Noted Tamblyn regarding the title character: \"There is something lovely about her, that in the face of something terrifying, she has to go back and see things that were never faced before.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2008 television films Category:Hallmark Channel original films Category:American films ",
