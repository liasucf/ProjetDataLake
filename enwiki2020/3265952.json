    "text": "Nazm (Urdu \u0646\u0638\u0645) is a major part of the Urdu poetry, that is normally written in rhymed verse and also in modern prose style poems. Nazm is a significant genre of Urdu poetry; the other one is known as Ghazal (Urdu: \u063a\u0632\u0644). Nazm is significantly written by controlling one\u2019s thoughts and feelings, which are constructively discussed as well as developed and finally, concluded, according to the poetic laws. The title of the Nazm itself holds the central theme as a whole. While writing Nazm, it is not important to follow any rules as it depends on the writer himself. A Nazm can be long or short and even there are no considerations being taken into account, specifically about its size or rhyming scheme. All the verses written in a Nazm are interlinked together. In simple words, Nazm is a form of a descriptive poetry. == Forms of Nazm == Following are the various different forms of Nazm:Dr. Khurshid Khawar Amrohvi, Moqaddma-tul-Kalaam, Arooz-o-Qafiya, p.116/132, Karachi, 1989Hakim Molana Anjum Foqi, Fikr-o-Fun, p.303/309, Karachi, 1974 * Doha (\u062f\u0648\u06c1\u0627) * Geet (\u06af\u06cc\u062a) * Hamd (\u062d\u0645\u062f) * Gazal (\u063a\u0632\u0644) * Hijv (\u06c1\u062c\u0648) * Kafi (\u06a9\u0627\u0641\u06cc) * Madah (\u0645\u062f\u062d) * Manqabat (\u0645\u0646\u0642\u0628\u062a) * Marsia (\u0645\u0631\u062b\u06cc\u06c1) * Masnavi (\u0645\u062b\u0646\u0648\u06cc) * Munajat (\u0645\u0646\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a) * Musaddas (\u0645\u0633\u062f\u0633) * Mukhammas (\u0645\u062e\u0645\u0633) * Na`at (\u0646\u0639\u062a) * Noha (\u0646\u0648\u062d\u06c1) * Qasida (\u0642\u0635\u06cc\u062f\u06c1) * Qat'\u00e3 (\u0642\u0637\u0639\u06c1) * Qawwali (\u0642\u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cc) * Rubai (\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u06cc) (a.k.a.
