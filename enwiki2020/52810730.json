He played as a scrum-half. ==Career== He played in two Rugby World Cups for Western Samoa in the 1990s. In 1991 he was part of the Samoa squad that memorably beat Wales 16-13 at the Cardiff Arms Park in what is still one of the biggest upsets in international rugby. However, he did not play any match of the tournament. In the 1995 World Cup quarter-finals he scored a try at Ellis Park against the eventual winners, South Africa. His first match for Western Samoa was in the test match against Tonga at Moamoa, on 4 June 1994. His last match for Samoa was against the New Zealand at Napier, on 7 June 1996. ==References== ==External links== * * Interview with Tu Nu'uali'itia at Planet Sport * Tu Nu'uali'tia at New Zealand Rugby History Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Rugby union players from Auckland Category:Samoan rugby union players Category:Samoan expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Rugby union scrum-halves Category:Samoa international rugby union players ",
