    "text": "New ward boundaries in 2006. Greater Sudbury City Council () is the governing body of the City of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The council consists of the mayor plus a twelve-person council. The city is divided into twelve wards; each ward is represented by one councillor. The council meets at Tom Davies Square. The city was created by amalgamating the former City of Sudbury with six suburban municipalities on January 1, 2001. Initially, the council structure consisted of six wards, each represented by two councillors. Ward boundaries in the new city were drawn by grouping former suburban municipalities with adjacent neighbourhoods in the former city. For the 2006 municipal election, council was reorganized into twelve single-member wards. Past mayors of the city and the former suburban municipalities are listed at List of mayors of Sudbury, Ontario. ==2000-2003== Council elected in the 2000 municipal election: {| class=\"wikitable\" width=50% !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Councillor !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Ward !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Notes |- | Jim Gordon || Mayor || |- | Eldon Gainer || Ward 1 || |- | Gerry McIntaggart || Ward 1 || |- | Ron Bradley || Ward 2 || |- | Lionel Lalonde || Ward 2 || |- | Ron Dupuis || Ward 3 || |- | Louise Portelance || Ward 3 || |- | Ted Callaghan || Ward 4 || |- | Dave Kilgour || Ward 4 || |- | Doug Craig || Ward 5 || |- | Austin Davey || Ward 5 || |- | David Courtemanche || Ward 6 || |- | Mike Petryna || Ward 6 || |} ==2003-2006== Council elected in the 2003 municipal election: {| class=\"wikitable\" width=50% !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Councillor !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Ward !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Notes |- | David Courtemanche || Mayor || |- | Eldon Gainer || Ward 1 || |- | Terry Kett || Ward 1 || |- | Claude Berthiaume || Ward 2 || |- | Ron Bradley || Ward 2 || |- | Ron Dupuis || Ward 3 || |- | Andr\u00e9 Rivest || Ward 3 || |- | Ted Callaghan || Ward 4 || |- | Russ Thompson || Ward 4 || |- | Frances Caldarelli || Ward 5 || |- | Doug Craig || Ward 5 || |- | Janet Gasparini || Ward 6 || |- | Lynne Reynolds || Ward 6 || |} ==2006-2010== Council elected in the 2006 municipal election: {| class=\"wikitable\" width=50% !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Councillor !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Ward !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Notes |- | John Rodriguez || Mayor || |- | Joe Cimino || Ward 1 || |- | Jacques Barbeau || Ward 2 || |- | Claude Berthiaume || Ward 3 || |- | Evelyn Dutrisac || Ward 4 || |- | Ron Dupuis || Ward 5 || |- | Andr\u00e9 Rivest || Ward 6 || |- | Russ Thompson || Ward 7 || |- | Ted Callaghan || Ward 8 || |- | Doug Craig || Ward 9 || |- | Frances Caldarelli || Ward 10 || |- | Janet Gasparini || Ward 11 || |- | Joscelyne Landry-Altmann || Ward 12 || |} ==2010-2014== Council elected in the 2010 municipal election. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=50% !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Councillor !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Ward !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Notes |- | Marianne Matichuk || Mayor || |- | Joe Cimino || Ward 1 || Elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on June 12, 2014.\"It's official: Cimino paints Sudbury riding orange\".

Sizer was appointed on June 26 to succeed Belli, and McIntaggart was appointed on July 8 to succeed Cimino. Unlike many cities in similar circumstances, Greater Sudbury City Council opted not to impose a requirement that the appointed councillors could not run for reelection in 2014; Sizer chose to run as a candidate and won reelection, while McIntaggart did not run. ==2014-2018== Council elected in the 2014 municipal election. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=50% !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Councillor !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Ward !style=\"background:#cccccc;\"| Notes |- | Brian Bigger || Mayor || |- | Mark Signoretti || Ward 1 || |- | Michael Vagnini || Ward 2 || |- | Gerry Montpellier || Ward 3 || |- | Evelyn Dutrisac || Ward 4 || |- | Robert Kirwan || Ward 5 || |- | Ren\u00e9 Lapierre || Ward 6 || |- | Mike Jakubo || Ward 7 || Finance Committee Chair\"Sudbury council names new committee members\".
