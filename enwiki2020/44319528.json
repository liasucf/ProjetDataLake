    "text": "Giancarlo Canavesio (born November 26, 1968) is an Italian film producer, Film Premiere Events organizer, investment banker, and entrepreneur. He is best known as founder and CEO of Mangusta Risk, Mangusta Productions Mangu.tv and Mangurama. He has produced several award-winning feature films including The Living Wake, FIX, Being in the World, 2012 Time for Change, Starlet and Neurons to Nirvana and Weed the people and Monogamish. He's currently in post production of Road to Dharma and currently producing two Reality Shows for TV on Post Capitalist Societies and Psychedelic Psychotherapy. == Early life and career == Giancarlo Canavesio grew up in Jakarta, Brussels, Athens and Rome. He was an investment banker in London for 10 years, then an entrepreneur in the financial consultancy and real estate industries for another 10 years. == Formation of Mangusta Productions == In 2005, Giancarlo's friend, filmmaker Fabrizio Chiesa shot a short film \u201cBeautiful Child\u201d (loosely based on a Truman Capote\u2019s novel) in his loft in TriBeCa. After production, Giancarlo formed Mangusta Productions, an independent production company based in New York City. He next produced a three-channel film on Meditation called \u201cSita\u201d also by Chiesa, which premiered in Paris at Ora Ita Gallery. Shortly after the creation of Mangusta Productions, Giancarlo produced the critically acclaimed feature films: \u201cThe Living Wake\u201d by Sol Tryon with Jesse Eisenberg and Jim Gaffigan and \u201cFix\u201d by Tao Ruspoli with Olivia Wilde and Shawn Andrews. == Expansion into feature documentaries == In 2009, Giancarlo started exploring documentaries to expand awareness on important topics. He produced \u201cBeing in the World\u201d by Tao Ruspoli, which explores what it means to be human in a technological age, and \u201c2012: Time for Change\u201d by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Joao Amorim with best-selling author Daniel Pinchbeck, Sting, Ellen Page and David Lynch about personal and global sustainability. Simultaneously he became a pioneer in hybrid film distribution in 2010, splitting the rights and pursuing them separately. In 2012, his next project \u201cStarlet,\u201d made on a micro-budget by award-winning director Sean Baker, examined the friendship between a porn star (Dree Hemingway) and an elderly woman and brilliantly illustrated how a story told with images can warm your heart. Giancarlo next produced and released Neurons to Nirvana: Understanding Psychedelics Medicineshttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt2195566/ and \u201cThe Lottery of Birth\u201d, by Raoul Martinez & Joshua Van Praag (the first episode of a trilogy called \u201cCreating Freedom\u201d). Neurons to Nirvana explores the medicinal properties (biological, emotional and psychological) of Cannabis, Psilocybin, MDMA, LSD and Ayahuasca. Over 1,000 people attended the NYC premiere in October 2013. The film, available online, is still touring around the world. \u201cThe Lottery of Birth\u201d explores how taking freedom for granted extinguishes the possibility of obtaining it. It ranked number 2 in the documentary section of ITunes. \u201cMonogamy and its Discontents\u201d by Tao Ruspoli, with a projected 2015 release, is an exploration of sex, love and marriage. Experts including best-selling authors Dan Savage and Christopher Ryan are intertwined with Tao\u2019s personal story. Also in production is \"Weed the People\", a new documentary on the anti- tumoral properties of cannabis oil for pediatric cancer. The film is directed by Abby Epstein and executive produced by Ricki Lake, the filmmakers behind the hit film \"The Business of Being Born\". == Mangu.tv == In 2013, Mangusta Production formed a new online digital platform, Mangu.tv, which has four categories of content. The site also hosts an online magazine called Ideas with original articles also aggregated around four categories: Drugs & Medicines, Sex & Love, Freedom & Society and Life & Death. Mangu.tv's mission statement is: \"We believe there is something broken with the way we have been approaching drugs, sex, death and politics. On the edges of mainstream culture people are proposing alternatives to the way they deal with drugs, practice intimacy, approach our last days and organize our society. Their ideas are gathering momentum, we believe in a few years they will be on everyone's minds. Mangu.tv produces and distributes films and an online magazine called Ideas Magazine that help bring these conversations to the wider world\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Italian businesspeople in real estate Category:Italian film producers Category:Living people Category:1968 births ",
