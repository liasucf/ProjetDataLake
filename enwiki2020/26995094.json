Her works are created using graphite on paper in a way that has been described as a talent for manipulating and \"painting\" with the basic medium.Graphite, Animals, and Bones: A Studio Visit with Nix Turner Juxtapoz Art & Culture MagazineNew York Daily News: Nix Turner's In Vein Art Show Turner moved from Southern Oregon to study at the California College of the Arts but left to pursue commercial arts, working as an illustrator for popular character brand Emily the Strange.Comic Book Database == Inspiration == \u2033The pieces I create reflect subject matters pertaining to biological deconstructionism, nature's legacy, alchemy, fables and counter-religious belief. In an orchestra of hyper-textured saturation, each piece is a cacophony of silent movement and erratic soliloquies.\u2033 Creating earthen stark worlds, including elements of ferns, bones, flowers, fungi, moths, insects and birds, Turner cites mythology, botany, and religious practices as her greatest influences. Botany is a reoccurring theme in Turner's illustrations, to which she infers a sense of post-modern regrowth among portrayals of the human forms depicted in her pieces. ==See also== * Illustrators * Botany * Symbolism (arts) == References == == External links == * Nicomi Nix Turner Website * Nicomi Nix Turner Blog * Artist Feature by Juxtapoz Art & Culture Magazine * New York Daily News: Nix Turner's In Vein Art Show * Artist A Day Feature Category:American women illustrators Category:Botanical illustrators Category:American illustrators Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Ashland, Oregon ",
