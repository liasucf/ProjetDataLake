Starting at Suwon, terminus of the railway's Suryeo Line, a line was built to Incheon Port via Sorae, and was opened for operation on 5 August 1937.\u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763\u5e9c\u5b98\u5831 (The Public Journal of the Governor-General of Korea), Sh\u014dwa No. 3168, 6 August 1937 On 26 October 1942, the Ch\u014dsen Gyeongdong Railway was acquired by the Ch\u014dsen Railway,\u671d\u9bae\u7e3d\u7763\u5e9c\u5b98\u5831 (The Public Journal of the Governor-General of Korea), Sh\u014dwa No. 4729, 4 November 1942 which continued operating the line until the end of the Pacific War.
