He was named secretary of the Convention on 5 March 1795 and appointed to the Committee of public safety on 3 June 1795. He opposed the Jacobins, speaking against the defence of Laurent Lecointre on 30 March, and on 19 May joined the deputies denouncing the actions of the Committee of public safety before Thermidor. Turning to Louis-Gustave Doulcet de Pont\u00e9coulant who was defending Robert Lindet, he cried out 'Do the eighteen months of their tyranny count for nothing with you?'Louis-Gabriel Michaud, Biographie des hommes vivants, Paris, 1816, vol.1 p.356 He also rebuked Jeanbon Saint Andr\u00e9 for having ruined the navy. He also joined the other deputies from Brest in denouncing Joseph Donz\u00e9 de Verteuil, the public prosecutor of the city's revolutionary tribunal. He was sent as a repr\u00e9sentant en mission to the arm\u00e9e de l'Ouest with Tallien. At the time of the Quiberon expedition, after the Republican victory, he demanded that the lives of \u00e9migr\u00e9s aged less than sixteen be spared, but the Convention nevertheless passed a decree condemning them. == The Council of Five Hundred == He stood down from the Committee of Public Safety on 13 Vendemiaire Year IV (5 October 1795). The Convention had decided that two thirds of the seats in the Council of Five Hundred, constituted under the 1795 constitution, were to be reserved for former members of the Convention itself, and on 4 Brumaire Year IV (26 October 1795)he was chosen as one of the deputies to serve in the new body. In the Council he sat on the benches of the right, suspected of royalism. On 19 January 1796 he protested against the reorganisation of the navy by the Directory. On 18 March 1797 he presented a report on deportees from Saint Domingue who were being detained in France. In his report he opposed a decree by the Directory which placed their fate in the hands of a commission, arguing instead that they should be brought before the tribunal of Charente-Inf\u00e9rieure. When his term as a Council came to an end in May 1798, he left political life. He was appointed deputy commissioner of the navy at Toulon in 1800Bernard Gainot, Dictionnaire des membres du Comit\u00e9 de salut public: dictionnaire analytique biographique et compar\u00e9 des 62 membres du Comit\u00e9 de salut public, Tallandier, 1990 p.88. and died in that city in December 1802. == References == Category:1764 births Category:1802 deaths Category:Deputies to the French National Convention Category:People on the Committee of Public Safety Category:Members of the Council of Five Hundred ",
