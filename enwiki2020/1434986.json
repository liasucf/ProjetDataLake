These elections spanned the Presidential election of 1860, won by Abraham Lincoln. Building on their successes in 1858, Republican candidates won increasing percentages in the House. After secessionist vacancies, their caucus of 108 amounted to 59% of the House, and with another 16% in the Unionist caucus, they had over a two-thirds super-majority to govern.Martis (1994), pp. 114\u2013115. Following Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, seven secessionist states declared rebellion and Jefferson Davis mobilized 100,000 troops in defense of the Confederacy. Lincoln responded with a call-up of 75,000 troops to reoccupy federal property in port cities. That motivated another four border states to declare secession, forming the Confederacy that fought the American Civil War. Seceding states cancelled elections to Federal office, and all but a few of their Representatives departed. Twenty-three representatives to U.S. 37th Congress came from five slave-holding states represented in the Confederacy: Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The rebellion left seventeen vacancies in those states. Meanwhile for the duration of the conflict those same five states sent full delegations to the Confederate Congress even though over half their congressional districts were federally occupied or disrupted by the end of 1862.Martis (1994), pp. 47. Overwhelmingly, seceding states had Democratic representation, so despite losing seats to Democrats in the North, this state-by-state mass departure left Republicans with a clear House majority. Remaining Representatives of all parties were united in support for the Union. Representatives opposing Democrats but not wishing to affiliate with Republicans, and wishing to emphasize support for the Union and opposition to secession, coalesced as the Unionist Party. Many of these Unionists were from Southern states. The nativist American Party disappeared, with its remaining support usually absorbed by Unionists. ==Election summaries== California was apportioned one additional seat for the 37th Congress, increasing the total seats to 239. Secession of Southern states vacated many seats. Few Representatives from these states remained. Missing Representatives were overwhelmingly Democrats, boosting Republican control. Several states held elections for the 37th Congress, but seceded before Congress convened, so the elected Representatives never served. Other seceding states held no elections. {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white\" | style=\"background:; width:24.04%\" | 44 | style=\"background:; width:0.55%\" | 1 | style=\"background:; width:59.02%\" | 108 | style=\"background:; width:16.39%\" | 30 |- | Democratic | | Republican | Unionist |} {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=bottom ! rowspan=2 | State ! rowspan=2 | Type ! rowspan=2 | Date ! rowspan=2 | Total seats ! colspan=2 | Democratic ! colspan=2 | Republican ! colspan=2 | Unionist ! colspan=2 | Others |- ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change !

Pro-Union Slave' states: light blue; (West Virginia abolished slavery with statehood.) Secessionist Convention Slave states: red The numbers in Congress are reduced by the 'vacant' seats In the wake of the declared secession of South Carolina from the Union on December 20, 1860, many Southern House members, mostly Democrats, refused to take their seats, rejecting the election of Lincoln as illegitimate. Before 1872, different states held elections at various times; the first elections for the 37th Congress were held on August 6, 1860 in Arkansas and Missouri, while the last election took place in California on September 4, 1861, a year later. Three Southern states \u2013 Arkansas, Florida, and South Carolina \u2013 chose Representatives before the presidential election, electing seven Democrats and two independents. These were the only House elections from the seceding states to the 37th Congress. After South Carolina resolved disunion and the Confederate States of America was formed, other Southern states declared as well and elected Representatives to the new Congress of the Confederate States instead of the United States Congress. Since the states not holding elections had many strong Democratic districts \u2013 in the previous 36th Congress their Representatives included a total of 46 Democrats, 14 Oppositionists, five independents, and one member of the American Party \u2013 when Congress was called into session on July 4, 1861 (five months earlier than usual at the time) the size of the Democratic House caucus had been drastically reduced, resulting in a huge Republican majority. Of the 183 seats, 102 were held by Republicans, 45 by Democrats, 23 by Unionists, and five others by one party each. There were several vacancies, and California had not held its election when Congress assembled. ==End of a Congressional era== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" align=right ! colspan=4 | US Congressional Party Transformation, 1857\u20131863Martis, pp. 111, 113, 115. |- !

Likewise, the congressional elections also marked the transition from one major era of political parties to another. In just six years, over the course of the 35th, 36th and 37th Congresses, a complete reversal of party fortunes swamped the Democrats.Martis, pp. 31\u201335. Columbia switches Stephen A. Douglas labeled with early election date 'news from Maine'. Uncle Sam looks on approvingly. Other early returns in PA, OH and IN showed good prospects for Republicans in the upcoming federal elections Elections for Congress were held from August 1860 to June 1861. They were held before, during and after the pre-determined Presidential campaign. And they were held before, during and after the secessionist campaigns in various states as they were reported throughout the country. Political conditions varied hugely from time to time during the course of congressional selection, but they had been shifting to a considerable extent in the years running up to the crisis.Martis, p. 36. In the 1856 elections, the Democrats had taken the Presidency for the sixth time in the last 40 years, with James Buchanan's victory over John C. Fremont and Millard Fillmore. They held almost a two-thirds majority in both the US House and Senate. Democrats held onto the Senate during the midterm elections, but the four opposition parties then amounted to two-thirds of the House. The congressional elections in 1860 transformed Democratic fortunes: Republican and Unionist candidates won a two-thirds majority in both House and Senate.Martis, p. 34. After the secessionist withdrawal, resignation and expulsion, the Democrats would have less than 25% of the House for the 37th Congress, and that minority divided further between pro-unionists (Stephen Douglas), and anti-war (Clement Vallandingham) factions.Martis, pp. 114, 115. == Results by region == The politics of these elections were distinctive in every region of the country.

Each congressional district has a link, named by its state abbreviation and its assigned number or noted At-large election. In a time before the Census Department published aggregate population data by congressional district, the reader may have ready access to census data identifying the make up of those each district by referring to their respective articles. The articles use different formats. The constituent counties of congressional districts are sometimes listed in a contents heading \"List of representatives\" within tables. These tables have a column naming the District's counties for each election, such as (a) \"District Area\" for Massachusetts, or (b) \"Area\" for Illinois and Maryland. Virginia uses \"Historical composition of the district\" to describe composition at each reapportionment. Pennsylvania notes the home county of the elected representative, sometimes holding the largest population for respective districts. Minnesota makes a geographical allusion for its 1st District applicable to the 37th Congress. Michigan uses \"History\" since 1852 for its 4th district. In some states, previous district composition is not described. === New England === ::Connecticut \u2014 Maine \u2014 Massachusetts \u2014 New Hampshire \u2014 Rhode Island \u2014 Vermont The twenty-nine seats in the House among these six states are divided 24 Republican, two Union one Constitutional Union, and two Democratic. The region is important nationally in manufacturing and intellectually as the center of literature, Transcendentalism and the abolition movement. === North Central === ::New Jersey \u2014 New York The 38 Representatives from this region would seat 25 Republicans and thirteen Democrats. This region had the closest commercial and social ties to the South due to its sea-going commerce and trans-shipping cotton to local textile plants and for export. === Border North === ::Illinois \u2014 Indiana \u2014 Michigan \u2014 Ohio \u2014 Pennsylvania \u2014 Wisconsin The 73 seats in this region were split 50 Republican, 23 Democratic. Illinois is the only state here with more Democrats than Republicans. These are free-soil states, north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line. These states had either abolished slavery, or Congress had forbidden it in their Territory, and they had forbidden it at the beginning of their statehood. === Border South and Middle South === ::Delaware \u2014 Kentucky \u2014 Maryland \u2014 Missouri \u2014 Tennessee \u2014 Virginia Of the 47 Representatives in these six states, 24 are Union Party, 1 Constitutional Union, 6 Democratic, and 15 would be vacant in Virginia and Tennessee. These were \"slave holding\" states, all south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line. The border south states had less than 2% to more than 19% of their 1860 population held as slaves, with an average of 13%; middle south states ranged from 25-33% slaves, with an average of 29%. (Deep south 43-57%, except Texas, with 30%.) Eight seats in Virginia and seven seats in Tennessee represented large numbers of citizens resisting the Lincoln administration of the United States government during the Civil War. They were declared vacant in 37th Congress documents.Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, (1774\u20132005), \"Official Annotated Membership Roster by State with Vacancy and Special Election Information for the 37th Congress\". === Trans- Mississippi West === ::California \u2014 Iowa \u2014 Kansas \u2014 Minnesota \u2014 Oregon \u2014 Non- voting members West of the Mississippi, there were 16 Representatives from states, and 9 Delegates from territories. The states elected nine Republicans and one Democrat. The Territories elected four Republicans, one Democrat and two Independents. When California entered the Union, it broke the free soil - slave state tie in the Senate. Minnesota, and Oregon followed as free soil states. Once Congress was depleted of the secessionist Democrats, the lame duck 36th Congress admitted Kansas as a free state in January 1861, in time for it to send a Representative to the 37th Congress in March. The Republican Congress elected in 1860 began funding the transcontinental railroad, July 1862. Nevada was admitted before the end of the Civil War in the next, 38th, Congress. === Vacant state delegations === ::Alabama \u2014 Arkansas \u2014 Florida \u2014 Georgia \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 Mississippi \u2014 North Carolina \u2014 South Carolina \u2014 Texas Forty-three seats represented large numbers of citizens in nine states resisting the Lincoln administration of the United States government during the Civil War. The following state delegations were entirely vacated. Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia are accounted for in the \"Border South and Middle South\" section. == Alabama == Alabama did not elect members to the House. {| class=wikitable |- ! rowspan=2 | District ! colspan=3 | Incumbent ! colspan=2 | This race |- !
