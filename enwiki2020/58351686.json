Noted for his shaved head and muscular physique, he is consistently among the most popular pornography searches. He has received many accolades for his work, including two nominations for the AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year. ==Early life== Sins was born Steven Wolfe in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 31, 1978. He has described himself as \"very shy\" while growing up. After graduating from college, he got a job working six days a week in construction. When he was around 24 years old, he noticed the early signs of pattern baldness and has kept his head shaved ever since.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3fcuGxeb8E In 2006, at the age of 28, he quit his job and moved to Los Angeles to enter the pornographic film industry. ==Career== Logo of Sins' production company Sins' first pornographic endeavors were through Craigslist ads. Brazzers has described him as a \"go-to guy\" for the studio, having performed in 1,054 scenes as of April 1, 2019. He performed in about 2,300 videos in his pornographic career. On June 10, 2015, Pornhub launched a crowdfunding campaign through Indiegogo to produce the first adult film in space. Sins and fellow actress Eva Lovia were slated to perform in the film. If the project were successfully funded, the two would have received six months of rigorous preparation for the launch, including zero gravity, velocity, and temperature training. When asked about the opportunity, Sins said, \"It's beyond just doing it for the money, or the money shot for that matter. It's about making history.\" The campaign raised $236,086 over 60 days, failing to reach its goal of $3.4 million. In early 2017, Sins and pornographic actress Kissa Sins (his then-wife) launched their YouTube channel SinsTV, which chronicles their day-to-day lives and features sex advice. To date, the channel has accumulated over 1.2 million subscribers. A video of Sins trying out various Turkish snacks briefly became the top YouTube video in Turkey. In July 2018, images of Sins alongside several other notable porn stars were painted on the side of a bus that traveled around Kerala in India. The mural was part of a marketing campaign aimed to boost college tour rides. Later that year, Sins received the award for Most Popular Male Performer by Women at the annual Pornhub Awards, for which winners were determined by users' streaming data. As of mid-2019, Sins has stopped filming porn but stated that he may return in the future. ==Personal life== Sins currently resides in Las Vegas. At an unknown date, he married pornographic actress Kissa Sins. They separated in 2019,https://www.instagram.com/p/B79MOe8HOoj/ but remain close friends.https://www.instagram.com/p/B9SHODmHrMv/ In October 2017, a picture of Sins was tweeted by a user claiming he was missing after the Las Vegas shooting. The tweet was one of many viral hoaxes that emerged related to the shooting. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"infobox\" |+ List of accolades received by Johnny Sins |- |- | colspan=3 | {| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" width=100% !
