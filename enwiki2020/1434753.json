    "text": "Aries is an American sounding rocket and target rocket, developed by Space Vector Corporation from retired LGM-30 Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) stages for use by the United States Air Force and NASA. Taken over by Orbital Sciences Corporation, Aries, as the Target Test Vehicle, remains in use. ==Design and development== In the late 1960s, the retirement of the LGM-30 Minuteman I ICBM resulted in the opportunity to produce a high- performance sounding rocket from the surplus solid-propellant rockets that became available; the Naval Research Laboratory awarded a contract to Space Vector Corporation in 1971Parsch 2005 to develop the \"Fat Albert\" rocket using the surplus Minuteman I first stages; before the first launch, the name of the rocket was changed to the \"more dignified\" Aries.Dickson 2009, pp. 24\u201325. Aries consisted of an Aerojet M56 solid-fuel rocket, the second stage of the Minuteman I, fitted with an aerodynamic nose cone and four tail fins, taken from the RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile, for stabilization. Steering was by gimbaled thrust; Aries retained its guidance system, redesigned for use as a sounding rocket, allowing for more precise flight paths and use of smaller rocket ranges than other sounding rockets required; however, its size meant it required a more substantial launch platform than conventional sounding rockets.EIS 1998, pp. 2\u201344 Payloads of could be lifted to apogees of over by Aries; the maximum payload capable of being carried was , and an apogee of was achieved on one flight. ==Operational history== The first launch of Aries, carrying a dummy payload, took place on 17 October 1973; following the first two test launches, the Talos stabilizing fins were replaced by a fins of a new design, and the skirt surrounding the rocket engine nozzles was modified. Aries entered operational service, being used on over 20 flights to launch payloads such as X-ray telescopes and ultraviolet telescopes that were too heavy to be lifted by conventional sounding rockets. Payloads could be recovered using a two-stage parachute system. In addition to its use as a sounding rocket, Aries was adapted for use as a target rocket to be used in the testing of anti-ballistic missiles. Contracted with Orbital Sciences Corporation for production in this role and designated the Target Test Vehicle (TTV), , over 50 target launches had taken place, primarily testing the United States Navy's RIM-156 SM-2 Extended Range and RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 missiles; the missile remains in service. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== *Aries at Encyclopedia Astronautica Category:Sounding rockets of the United States Category:Target missiles Category:Equipment of the United States Air Force ",
