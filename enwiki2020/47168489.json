New York Times ]22 Aug 1936: 6. ==Reception== Frank Nugent of The New York Times said, \"Miss Martha Raye, the lusty lark of Paramount's roster of curiosa, has her starring moment in Hideaway Girl, current at the Rialto. Some one in our circle has suggested that the explosive Miss Raye has but one opportunity left\u2014to swallow a stick of dynamite and light the fuse, distributing her animated self over a Paramount set. In Hideaway Girl Miss Raye falls sadly short of this mark, contenting herself, in her own peculiar form of vociferation, with expressing her preference for \"Liszt, Beethoven or Bach\" over the current manifestation of vo-de-o-do. She expresses this preference with swing dance gestures.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1936 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1936 comedy films Category:Films directed by George Archainbaud Category:American black-and-white films ",
