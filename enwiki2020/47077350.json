    "text": "Carl Persson (born June 28, 1995) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward. He is currently playing with the Malm\u00f6 Redhawks of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). ==Playing career== Undrafted, Persson played as a youth with Tingsryds AIF at the J20 SuperElit level. Persson made his Swedish Hockey League debut playing with HV71 during the 2014\u201315 SHL season. After two seasons in the HockeyAllsvenskan with BIK Karlskoga, Persson returned to the SHL in signing a two-year contract with Karlskrona HK on March 30, 2017. In the 2017\u201318 season, Persson finished third on Karlskrona with 24 points in 52 games in his first full season in the SHL. Unable to prevent Karlskrona HK from relegation to the HockeyAllsvenksan, Persson invoked an NHL release clause, in signing a two-year, entry-level contract with the Nashville Predators on May 9, 2018. After attending the Predators training camp, Persson found himself beginning the 2018\u201319 season with the Predators secondary affiliate, the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL. After contributing 3 points in 6 games and unable to progress to the AHL, Persson agreed to a mutual termination of his contract with the Predators, immediately returning to sign a two-year contract with the Malm\u00f6 Redhawks of the SHL on November 9, 2018. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
