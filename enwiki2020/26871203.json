Chantilly porcelain is French soft-paste porcelain produced between 1730 and 1800 by the manufactory of Chantilly in Oise, France. The wares are usually divided into three periods, 1730-51, 1751-1760, and a gradual decline from 1760 to 1800. The factory made table and tea wares, small vases, and some figures, these all of Orientals. ==Foundation== Outbuildings were purchased in March 1730 on the banks of the small river Nonette near the extensive park of his ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly by Louis Henri de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9, the prince of the blood exiled from Court, who founded the factory.Genevi\u00e8ve Le Duc, Porcelaine tendre de Chantilly au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, Paris, 1996, the first full-length monograph. At this period, the capital investment required for establishing a porcelain manufactory was so extensive that a royal or aristocratic patron was essential; only in Britain was early porcelain manufacture capitalized by the merchant class. The elite wares of Chantilly were intended to compete with Saint-Cloud porcelain, a pioneer among French soft-paste porcelain manufactures,Its precursor was the porcelain manufacture of Rouen: see M.L. Solon, \"The Rouen Porcelain\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 7 (May 1905:116-124). and other small manufactures at Mennecy, under the protection of the duc de Villeroy, as well as with imported Meissen porcelain and Chinese porcelains. Like the other French factories of this period, and unlike the \"Saxon\" hard-paste porcelain produced at Meissen, kaolin was not amongst the raw materials of the Chantilly body.Metropolitan Museum of Art: \"French porcelain in the eighteenth century\"; W.B. Honey, French Porcelain of the 18th Century, London, 1950. ==First period: Chinese and Japanese designs (1725-1751)== Cond\u00e9 was an avid collector of East Asian porcelains, both Chinese and Japanese, and his Chantilly manufactory's first decade of output showed the marked influence of Arita porcelain, particularly in the \"Kakiemon\" palette of soft iron red and blue-green, seen in the tea pot at leftMetropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 50.211.121: A large Chantilly jar, ca 1735\u201340 copies a Japanese form and Kakiemon coloring; Cleveland Museum of Art: Tea set, ca.1730, acc. no. 1944.228 Decorative vases and figurines (or magots) for the chimneypieceSuch as Cleveland Museum of Art: Seated Chinese with a Pot, ca.1740, acc. no. 1947.62. were produced, and useful wares included delicately modelled rococo tea-pots and cream jugs, coffee-sets or cabarets complete with their trays, covered tureens, bourdaloues, plates and cups,John Fleming and Hugh Honour, Dictionary of the Decorative Arts, 1977 s.v. \"Chantilly porcelain factory\". down to porcelain flowers to incorporate in chandeliers and knife-handles.William Chaffers, Marks and monograms on pottery & porcelain s.v. \"Chantilly\". A patent granted to the factory in 1735 by Louis XV specifically describes the right to make porcelain fa\u00e7on de Japon, \"in imitation of the porcelain of Japan;\" its reference to ten years' successful experiment on the part of Ciquaire Cirou (ca 1700-1751)Cirou had probably gained his expertise at Saint-Cloud; where he was a painter; in 1728 he was working in rue de la Ville l'Ev\u00eaque (The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, s.v. \"Chantilly: Porcelain\"). is the basis for dating the factory's origins to 1725, found in many sources.E.g. Hodder Michael Westropp, Handbook of pottery and porcelain, 1880; Old and Sold: \"Chantilly China 1725-1789\" etc. At first the body of the ware was covered with an opaque tin-glaze like that used for faience, providing a clean white ground for the sparse decors in enamel colors. Later a slightly yellowish clear lead glaze was employed. The prince de Cond\u00e9 died in 1740, after which the factory was forced to support itself, and reduced its ambitions.J. Paul Getty Museum: \"Chantilly Porcelain Manufactory\" The manager of the factory, until his death in 1751, remained Ciquaire Cirou; under his care Chantilly produced its most characteristic porcelains, which were so valued by collectors in the 19th century that many successful fakes were produced by makers such as Edme Samson, reproducing the famous underglaze factory mark of a hunting horn.Reproduction of a Chantilly teapot, Edme Samson et Cie., Paris, ca 1900 File:Chateau de Chantilly FRA 008.JPG|The Salon des porcelaines, Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly.

The factory at Chantilly produced some wares in the Vincennes-S\u00e8vres taste but, especially after its sale in 1781 by Dame Adam, was in rapid decline towards the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, squeezed between the competition of S\u00e8vres at the high end of the market, and, after the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1788, by Wedgwood cream ware for table wares. Its manager, the Englishman Christopher Potter, bought it in the early stages of the French Revolution (1792),Potter's purchase marks the end of the period covered by Le Duc 1996. but it closed shop in 1800. In fact, Potter set up two different manufactures, the first one early 1792 and the second in 1795. ==See also== * Orientalism in early modern France ==Notes== Category:Ceramics manufacturers of France Category:Porcelain of France Category:1730 establishments in France Category:French companies established in 1730 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1730 ",
