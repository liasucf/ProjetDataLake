The Soberanes Fire was the result of an illegal campfire in Garrapata State Park. The fire burned along the Big Sur coast in the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, and adjacent private and public land in Monterey County, California. At the fire's peak, over 5,000 personnel were assigned to the blaze. At the time that it was extinguished, the Soberanes fire ranked 18th on the list of the top 20 largest California wildfires, in terms of acreage burned. ==The fire== The final perimeter of the Soberanes Fire, on October 22, 2016.

On Tuesday July 26, at 11:00 PM, Robert Oliver Reagan, an on-call bulldozer operator contracted by Czirban Concrete Construction to CalFire, was killed when his bulldozer rolled over, pinning him, while he was maneuvering around a fire truck on a steep slope in the Palo Colorado Canyon area.Dozer Rollover Fatality Bulldozer operator Robert Reagan, 35, of Fresno County, died July 26, 2016, when his bulldozer overturned while he was building a fire line near Palo Colorado Canyon in Big Sur. The fire destroyed 57 homes and 11 outbuildings in the Garrapata Canyon and Palo Colorado Canyon areas during the first three weeks. Robert Baird, supervisor of the Los Padres National Forest, estimated that firefighters saved US$6.8 billion worth of real estate. The fire burned and possibly killed the largest Pacific madrone tree in the United States, within the Joshua Creek Canyon Ecological Reserve. The tree was tall and more than in circumference. The madrone was listed on the American Forests National Big Tree list, a register of the biggest trees by species in the United States. The California Department Of Parks And Recreation announced on September 28, 2016 that Garrapata State Park east of Highway 1, where the fire started, would remain closed through the winter. ===Legal actions=== In March 2017, Reagan's family filed a wrongful death suit against the state of California for her husband's death while fighting the fire. They later dropped the suit due to a law that gives the state immunity from wrongful death lawsuits. In April 2017, Czirban Concrete Construction, the contractor by whom Reagan was employed, was fined $20,000 for failing to report the fatality, failing to require seat belts on the equipment, failing to warn employees of the applicable hazards, and other offenses. Ian Czirban, the head of the company, was also charged by Monterey County prosecutors with six felonies for tax evasion, insurance fraud, and a misdemeanor charge for failing to maintain workers' compensation insurance. Czirban disputed the fines and charges, saying that he was not Reagan's employer and did not own the equipment at issue. He entered a plea of \"not guilty\" on May 11, 2017. In October 2019, Czirban was found was guilty of two counts of willfully failing to file a payroll tax return, a count of not having a workers' compensation insurance policy, and a count of filing a false document. He was convicted and sentenced to 300 days of home confinement and three years of felony probation for violating state labor laws. Another company, Industrial Defense Development, was fined $6,000 for injuries that another firefighter sustained when the water truck he was driving rolled over an embankment. ==Cause== On August 2, 2016, officials announced that their investigation found that the fire had been caused by an unattended illegal campfire. While no suspect was identified, Monterey County District Attorney Dean Flippo said that, if an arrest were made, the culprit could be charged with negligence and manslaughter. ==See also== *2016 California wildfires *Wildfire suppression *Aerial firefighting ==References== ==External links== * * * Satellite photos of the Soberanes Fire. * Category:2016 California wildfires Category:August 2016 events in the United States Category:Big Sur Category:July 2016 events in the United States Category:October 2016 events in the United States Category:Monterey Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest Category:Santa Lucia Range Category:September 2016 events in the United States Category:Wildfires in Monterey County, California ",
