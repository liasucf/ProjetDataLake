It was developed in the 1890s in Lyon by Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re.This was not the first 'moving picture' device. Louis Le Prince had built early devices in 1886. His 1888 film Roundhay Garden Scene still survives. ==History== The Institut Lumi\u00e8re in Lyon, France The device was invented and patented as the \"Cin\u00e9matographe L\u00e9on Bouly\" by French inventor L\u00e9on Bouly on February 12, 1892. Bouly coined the term \"cinematograph,\" from the Greek for \"writing in movement.\"Abel, Richard. Encyclopedia of Early Cinema. 1st ed. London: Routledge, 2004. Due to a lack of money, Bouly could not develop his ideas properly and maintain his patent fees, so he sold his rights to the device and name to the Lumi\u00e8re brothers.Cin\u00e9ma des premiers temps: nouvelles contributions fran\u00e7aises par Michel Mari\u00e9, Thierry Lefebvre, in collection Th\u00e9or\u00e8me (1996) In 1895, they applied the name to a device that was mostly their own invention. The Lumi\u00e8re brothers made their first film, Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory (Sortie de l'usine Lumi\u00e8re de Lyon), that same year. The first commercial, public screening of cinematographic films happened on 28 December 1895 at Salon Indien du Grand Caf\u00e9 in Paris and was organised by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers.Louis Lumi\u00e8re, The Lumi\u00e8re Cinematograph. In: This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory. Each of these early films is 17 meters long (approximately 56 feet), which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds. The Cin\u00e9matographe was also exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1900. At the Exposition, films made by the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers were projected onto a large screen measuring 16 by 21 meters (approximately 52.5 x 69 feet).Cinematograph, Louis Lumi\u00e8re. \u201c1936 the Lumi\u00e8re Cinematograph.\u201d SMPTE Journal 105, no. 10 (October 1, 1996): 608\u2013611. Several versions of cin\u00e9matographes were developed, including ones by the inventor Robert Royou Beard (1856-1932),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Beard the electrical engineer Cecil Wray (1866-1944),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Wray the optician Alfred Wrench (?-?),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Wrench Georges Demen\u00ff and, of course, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. ==Invention== The Cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re in projection mode The Cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re at Institut Lumi\u00e8re Louis Lumi\u00e8re and his brother Auguste worked together to create a motion-picture camera superior to Thomas Edison's kinetograph, which did not have a projector. The Lumi\u00e8res endeavored to correct the flaws they perceived in the kinetograph and the kinetoscope, to develop a machine with both sharper images and better illumination. The Cin\u00e9matographe weighed only , which allowed for ease of transportation and placement. As well, the Cin\u00e9matographe was manually operated by a hand-crank, as opposed to Edison's electrically powered camera, which was not readily portable. Furthermore, while only one person at a time could use Edison's kinetoscope for viewing\u2014through an eyepiece, peep show style\u2014the Cin\u00e9matographe could project an image onto a screen so a large audience of people could view images simultaneously.Gomery, Professor Douglas, and Clara Pafort-Overduin. Movie History: A Survey. Taylor & Francis, 2011. The Cin\u00e9matographe produced a sharper projected image than had been seen before due to its design, in which a kind of fork held frames behind the lens in place using the perforations in the sides of the film strip. In 1897, the Lumi\u00e8res further added to their invention by using a glass flask of water as the condenser to concentrate the light onto the film frame and to absorb heat. The flask also acted as a safety feature, as the light would no longer focus on the flammable film if the glass were to break due to overheating or accident. ==Popularity== After the success of the Lumi\u00e8res's initial public screening in 1895, the Cin\u00e9matographe became a popular attraction for people all over the world. The Lumi\u00e8re brothers took their machine to China and India and it was enjoyed by people of all classes and social standings. The Cin\u00e9matographe was used to show films in nickelodeons, where even the poorest classes could pay the entry fee. It was exhibited at fairs and used as entertainment in vaudeville houses in both Europe and the United States. While vaudeville is typically associated with the working and middle classes, the machine also found its way into more sophisticated venues, where it appealed to the artistic tastes of high society. ==See also== * Bioscop * Biograph * Electrotachyscope * Film * Image * Kinetoscope * List of film formats * Panoptikon * Pleograph * Praxinoscope * Vitascope * Zoopraxiscope == Notes == === Explanatory notes === === References === ==External links== * Adventures in Cybersound * * Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1895 Category:Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re Category:History of film ",
