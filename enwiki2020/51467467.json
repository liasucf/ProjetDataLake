He grew up mostly in Hamburg, where he attended the Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste (Academy of Fine Arts) from 1963 to 1968. ===The German period=== In 1965, he was a cofounder of Cruizin 4', Syndikat f\u00fcr Kunstbetrieb (syndicate for art scene), together with fellow artists Francesco Mariotti, Hermann Prigann, Werner N\u00f6fer and Dieter Glasmacher. It is best known through two events: The opening of the exhibition Cruizin 4 in the Gallery Mensch at Fischmarkt Hamburg-Altona, where the members came with a stretched limousine with chauffeur.Cf. Gottfried Sello: Die K\u00fcnstler kamen im Kolossalauto...sie nennen sich Syndikat f\u00fcr Kunstbetrieb in: Hamburger Abendblatt 30. M\u00e4rz 1967. And by a performance at Cosinus,Cf.

World Record in Permanent Painting took place under medical, and specifically psychiatric care, too, by doctors of the University Hospital Eppendorf. (The planned on about 80-hour performance was canceled after 36 hours on medical advice because of collapse of one of the participants).Cf. Wolfgang Feucht: Mal-Schlacht um Weltrekord unter \u00e4rztlicher Aufsicht in: Bremer Nachrichten, 10. November 1967.Cf. Anke Grundmann: Weltmeister im Dauermalen in: Die Welt, 06. November 1967. Under the moniker Dizi, Dirk Zimmer had a brief career as a painter during the German avant- garde movement and then turned to filmmaking, which he eventually dropped in the late 1970s to work as an illustrator for such American publications as Crawdaddy, the New York Times, and The New-York Magazine. Over the years, both his paintings and illustrations, were shown in private galleries in New York, Germany, Switzerland, and France. ===The American period=== His work as a children's book illustrator began after moving permanently to New York City in 1977. He also continued to exhibit his artwork and to be a presence in the New York art scene. He found a flat in John Street, right under the roof, for a lengthy period of time. The only media contact to his homeland was through the German Boa Vista magazine, in which he first published vignettes,Cf. Boa Vista 5. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Neue Literatur. Ed. by Daniel Dubbe/Manfred Henning/Natias Neutert/Peter Waldheim, Hamburg 1977, pp. 1, 96. than later his written and illustrated (from 1977, New York) short-story comic with the cryptically and untranslatable German title Die mysteri\u00f6se Schratzmichl\u00f6se.Cf. Boa Vista 6. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Neue Literatur. Ed. by Natias Neutert/Peter Waldheim/Manfred Henning, Hamburg 1978, pp. 49\u201355. From 1978 to 2004 Zimmer published more than two and a half dozen kid's books. Zimmer moved to Barrytown, NY in the early 1980s, and later lived in the Rondout area of Kingston. He was a contributor and collaborator at the northern Dutchess quarterly AboutTown. He later moved to Tivoli, NY. In 1990, he was one of a small group of illustrators\u2014including Natalie Babbitt, Maurice Sendak, Marc Simont and Barbara Cooney\u2014whose work was featured in The Big Book for Peace (Dutton, 1990), an anthology of 34 artists and writers. ===Car accident and death=== In Tivoli, on a walk to the river on the afternoon of September 21, 2008, Zimmer was struck by a car. He died five days later on September 26 from his wounds at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He is survived by two sisters who live in Germany. The sequel of the book Egon (published 1980), on which he was working at that time, was left unfinished. Egon, Zimmer\u2019s adventurous, furry alter ego, leaves the following note at the end of the book: \"I am having a good time. I will be home some day but not until the show ends. Maybe soon.\" ==Books in cooperation== === In German=== * 1982 Egon by Larry Bograd.

The Trick-Or-Treat Trap\u2014the only book that he has written and illustrated by himself, got the most resonance and response in criticism. So The New York Times praised the humor of this work with the adjective \"tongue-in-cheek\": \"His pen has bite as he pictures a wonderfully wicked assortment of ornery little beings.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1943 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American children's book illustrators Category:German artists Category:German writers Category:People from Goslar ",
