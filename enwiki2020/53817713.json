    "text": "Angelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila Malav\u00e9 (February 21, 1944 - July 8, 2003) was a Puerto Rican poet and writer who explored themes of love, relationships, and womanhood. She is an Afro-feminist and Afro-Caribbean voice who identified her black Puerto Ricanness as a defining characteristic of her work and personal identity. == Biography == Angelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila Malav\u00e9 was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico February 21, 1944. She wrote poetry in her native Spanish before attending the Universidad de Puerto Rico in the 1960s and was a part of the Generaci\u00f3n del 60, a prominent and revolutionary group of Puerto Rican poets, where she contributed to the literary magazine Guajana. She collaborated with fellow Puerto Rican poet and husband Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lima. Angelamar\u00eda was a singer and drawer, performing at cabarets and including her illustrations alongside her poems as seen in la querencia, in which color pencil and black pen drawn human figures are accompanied by the graphic design work of artist Nelson Sambol\u00edn. She has two living children, actor Aurelio Lima (born in 1970) and Amanda Col\u00f3n (born in 1980). She died of lung complications from Alzheimer's July 8, 2003 in R\u00edo Grande. == Career == Puerto Rican literary magazine, Revista Guajana, credits D\u00e1vila online with contributing to the first issue (G1.1) of Guajana in 1962 with two poems entitled I and II. She would soon after leave Guajana to continue her work as an individual poet. Her influences included Julia de Burgos, Clara Lair, Sylvia Rexach and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. According to her biography on the Fundaci\u00f3n Nacional para la Cultura Popular of Puerto Rico, in 1963, noted poet Jorge Luis Morales presented D\u00e1vila to the Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o, where she performed her first recital. In 1965 some of her poems were included in the Antolog\u00eda de j\u00f3venes poetas edited by the Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique\u00f1a. In 1966 she and husband Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lima collaborated on their poemario (a collection of poems), Homenaje al ombligo (Homage to the navel), a work of poetry and drawings centering on intimacy and sensuality. In 1977, D\u00e1vila published her second book of poems Animal fiero y tierno. This was D\u00e1vila's first solo book publication. In 1994, her work was included in the \u201cAntolog\u00eda de la poes\u00eda hispanoamericana actual\u201d, edited by Julio Ortega. In 2004, a number of her poems were included in \u201cFlor de lumbre: Guajana 40 aniversario 1962-2002\". A third collection of poems, la querencia, was published posthumously in 2006 by the Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique\u00f1a. == Themes in her work == === Love === Love is a central idea to the body of D\u00e1vila's work as evidence of her interest and engagement with love's place in the human experience. In la querencia, for example, a preface poem following after the title page posits love in relation to Spanish prepositions that locate and position love: a afuera adentro arriba abajo adelante atr\u00e1s antes bajo cabe con contra cuando de desde despu\u00e9s durante en entre excepto hacia hasta mediante mientras para por pues salvo seg\u00fan sin so sobre tras el amor. According to love, against love, within love, and without love are manners of engaging with the concept of love that D\u00e1vila establishes at the beginning of her work for readers to consider and as foreground to the further exploration within the work. Significantly, the word querencia means love, fondness, and attachment. Throughout this poemario, she directs and muses poems about herself and a male lover, their love and how their bodies play a role in their experience. === The human body === D\u00e1vila writes about the human body, especially in the sixth section of la querencia entitled, \"MORADA TERCERA/TU CUERPO SIEMPRE C\u00c1LIDO\", in which she explores \"cosas del cuerpo, del \u00e1nima, del silencio\" in three \"habitaciones\" containing approximately 24 poems. In the first section she dedicates 10-11 line poems about different body parts of her lover. In a poem about his hands, she compares them to roots like \"certain scars\" and explores the idea of her thirst as maintaining the hands which enjoy and support her desire: \"tus manos\" son tus manos agoreras dos destiladas ra\u00edces de la tierra; cicatrices desprendidas y certeras. crecientes van por la vera del aire, que las detiene, arrastradas se sostienen prometen, hurgan, rebuscan siempre encuentran, siempre gustan de mi sed, que las mantiene D\u00e1vila states that his hands \"sustain\", \"promise\", \"always find\", and \"always enjoy\" her thirst, evincing the intimate and sensual language emblematic of her poetry. The choice to explore the human body in poetry are standard for D\u00e1vila's work, where she engages with the personal, using her writing as a conduit to a better understanding of humanity in a physical and spiritual sense. == Books of Poetry by \u00c1njelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila == * Homenaje al ombligo, D\u00e1vila, \u00c1njelamar\u00eda y Lima, Jose Maria. 1966 ** a collaborative book of poetry and drawings * Animal fiero y tierno, D\u00e1vila, \u00c1njelamar\u00eda.

Sotomayor critically engages with D\u00e1vila's poetic language and process of self-definition. * Las palabras sublevadas, Forner\u00edn, Miguel Angel.

On the page simply titled \"\u00c1njelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila\", Forner\u00edn notes that D\u00e1vila and her work collapse the boundaries of the culto and the popular to bring the sublime and irreverent together. Forner\u00edn considers her a pioneer as a woman not bound by the moral conventions of her time, primarily the 70s, in which she challenges hyper masculine attitudes and expectations of femininity to explore love, relationships, and womanhood without limits. * Puerto Rico ind\u00f3cil: antolog\u00eda de cuentos puertorrique\u00f1os del siglo XXI, Bel\u00e9n, Ana y Sevillano, Mart\u00edn.

In \"Ficha: \u00c1njelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila,\" Puerto Rican writer Yvonne Denis Rosario exaggerates the death of \u00c1njelamar\u00eda D\u00e1vila as a murder by a medical examiner and boyfriend who admires D\u00e1vila's craft of words and the public praise they yield, yet who ultimately kills her. Yvonne Denis Rosario assumes the role of an intimate friend, all-knowing investigator and medical examiner privy to the details of the case, the testimony of the neighbor, and the autopsy of her friend. She compares the poetry of \u00c1njelamar\u00eda to brilliant butterflies that come out of her mouth in perhaps a nod to the poets reference of animals throughout her work but especially in Animal fiero y tierno. Rosario references D\u00e1vila's Alzheimer's. == Multimedia == * The author reading some of her poetry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv4dG1XKJUA * Amarilis Tav\u00e1rez reading \"Ante tanta visi\u00f3n\" by D\u00e1vila from her book of poems Animal fiero y tierno: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2wA6tRlfHU * Several poems on Revista Guajana: http://revistaguajana.com/paginaguajana2/angelamaria.htm == References == Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:People from Humacao, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican poets Category:Puerto Rican women Category:University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:1944 births Category:2003 deaths ",
