    "text": "Bloodflowers is the eleventh studio album by British alternative rock band the Cure, released in February 2000. Singer Robert Smith chose to not release any single off the album, against the will of the record company. Bloodflowers was released to mixed reviews. == Release == Bloodflowers was released on 15 February 2000 by record label Fiction. No commercial singles were released from Bloodflowers, but two promotional singles were released to DJs and radio stations: Out of This World, in January (Europe) and May (U.S.), and Maybe Someday, in January (U.S.) and April (Europe). It was a moderate success, debuting at number 16 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2001. == Reception == Entertainment Weekly called it \"one of the band's most affecting works\". Melody Maker titled their review \"Goth - Awful!\", rating the album 1.5 out of 5. Rolling Stone criticized the quality of the compositions, saying, \"[Smith] can write four bad songs in a row, and Cure albums tend to leak filler like an attic spilling insulation\" and concluded, \"Bloodflowers, is half dismissible droning, an unforgivable ratio considering it's only nine tracks long.\" Similarly, Trouser Press stated in their review: \"The album sounds completely uninspired, as Smith and company go through the motions of Cure-ness.\" AllMusic noted that although Bloodflowers contained all the Cure's musical trademarks, \"morose lyrics, keening vocals, long running times\", \"the album falls short of the mark, largely because it sounds too self-conscious\". == Track listing == == Personnel == The Cure * Robert Smith \u2013 guitar, keyboard, 6-string bass, vocals * Simon Gallup \u2013 bass * Perry Bamonte \u2013 guitar, 6-string bass * Jason Cooper \u2013 percussion, drums * Roger O'Donnell \u2013 keyboard Production *Paul Corkett \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Robert Smith \u2013 producer, mixing *Sacha Jankovich \u2013 engineer *Ian Cooper \u2013 mastering *Daryl Bamonte \u2013 project coordinator *Perry Bamonte \u2013 photography *Paul Cox \u2013 photography *Alex Smith \u2013 photography *Alexis Yraola \u2013 logo == Charts == Album \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- | rowspan=\"2\"|2000 | The Billboard 200 | align=\"center\"|16 |- | Top Internet Albums | align=\"center\"|2 |} Singles \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- | 2000 | \"Maybe Someday\" | Modern Rock Tracks | align=\"center\"|10 |} == Certifications == == References == == External links == * Category:The Cure albums Category:2000 albums Category:Fiction Records albums Category:Elektra Records albums ",
