    "text": "Lost in Hong Kong is a 2015 Chinese comedy film directed, co-written and co- produced by Xu Zheng, starring himself along with Bao Bei'er, Zhao Wei, and Du Juan. This is Xu's second directorial feature, after the huge domestic hit Lost in Thailand (2012) which grossed over US$208 million. It was released in China on September 25, 2015 and broke several box office records there. It was released in Hong Kong and Macau on November 19. ==Plot== In the mid-1990s, university art majors Xu Lai (Xu Zheng) and Yang Yi (Du Juan) fell in love, but then Yang was transferred to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Xu has never seen her since. Almost twenty years later, the already bald Xu has long forgotten his dreams of becoming an artist, but he can never forget Yang even though he enjoys a comfortable life with his loving wife Cai Bo (Zhao Wei), the only major problem between them being the repeated failure conceiving a child. During a vacation in Hong Kong with Cai's overbearing family, Xu plans to secretly visit Yang, but Cai Bo's goofy young brother Cai Lala (Bao Bei'er) \u2014 always carrying a video camera in hand for his documentary project \u2014 tags along like his unwelcome shadow to spoil the rendezvous. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Wong Jing is filming another riotous gangster movie, while 2 police officers (Sam Lee and Eric Kot) investigate a murder. One of them attempts to topple the case and threatens Xu Lai's near and dear. ==Cast== *Xu Zheng as Xu Lai, a man facing midlife crisis *Zhao Wei as \"Spinach\" a.k.a.

This is Wong's only recording in 2015. The song title, taken from Su Shi's 1082 masterpiece Qian Chibi Fu (\u524d\u8d64\u58c1\u8ce6; Former Ode on the Red Cliffs), can be translated as \"the breeze blows gently\". In this case, the title can also be interpreted as \"Xu Lai the Breeze\", a reference of the protagonist's name. *The film also features a number of Cantopop hits from 1980s and 1990s Hong Kong, summarised below: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Song!!Singer!!Music!!Lyrics!!Notes |- |\"Pin Pin Hei Foon Nei\" ||colspan=2|Danny Chan||Cheng Kwok-kong||title track of Chan's 1983 album |- |\"Seoi Ho Goi Bin\" ||Alan Tam||Joseph Koo||Cheng Kwok-kong||theme song of The Fearless Duo (1984) included in Tam's 1984 album Roots of Love (\u611b\u7684\u6839\u6e90) |- |\"Wai Nei Zung Cing\" ||Leslie Cheung||Wong Ching-yue||James Wong||theme song of For Your Heart Only (1985) title track of Cheung's 1985 album |- |\"Ngo Long Cyun Syut\" ||Jacky Cheung||John Laudon||Poon Wai-yuen||title track of Cheung's 1994 album |- |\"Zan Dik Hon Zi\" ||colspan=2|George Lam||Cheng Kwok-kong||theme song of And Yet We Live (1988) included in Lam's 1988 album Song of Life (\u751f\u547d\u4e4b\u66f2) |- |\"Cong Hoi Jat Sing Siu\" ||Samuel Hui||colspan=2|James Wong||theme song of The Swordsman (1990) |- |\"Mong Cing Sam Baa Mou\" ||Grasshopper||Volker Barber||Chow Lei-mau||title track of Grasshopper's 1991 album |- |\"Jat Saang So Oi\" ||colspan=2|Lowell Lo||Susan Tong||theme song of A Chinese Odyssey (1995) |- |\"Soeng Hoi Taan\" ||Frances Yip||Joseph Koo||James Wong||theme song of The Bund (1980) title track of Yip's 1980 album |- |\"Sin Neoi Jau Wan\" ||Leslie Cheung||colspan=2|James Wong||theme song of A Chinese Ghost Story (1987) included in Cheung's 1987 album Summer Romance |- |\"Cing Jan\" ||Beyond||Wong Ka Kui||Lau Cheuk-fai||included in Beyond's 1993 album Rock and Roll theme song of The Tragic Fantasy - Tiger of Wanchai (1994) |- |\"Maan Lei Coeng Sing Wing Bat Dou\" ||Johnny Yip||Lai Siu-tin||Lo Kwok-chim||theme song of The Legendary Fok (1981) included in Yip's 1981 album The Legendary Fok |} ==Reception== ===Box office=== Buoyed by growing anticipation from fans, minor competition and the ever-growing expansion of the Chinese movie industry, Lost in Hong Kong is projected to be a box office success. It made more than half of what its immediate predecessor earned in its entire lifetime in just three days. Critics noted that the film will no doubt surpass its predecessor's US$208 million gross. It had a worldwide opening of US$106.8 million, which is the second biggest of all time for a comedy film behind The Hangover Part II (US$177.8 million) in 2011, and the biggest for a non-English language film. Its worldwide opening was also the biggest of its release weekend (ahead of Hotel Transylvania 2). Although the film didn't face any serious competition with its fellow new releases during its opening weekend, it started facing competition from new releases\u2014Saving Mr. Wu, Goodbye Mr. Loser, and Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe\u2014on September 30, 2015 albeit none of them were able to outgross the former. In China, it made $1.8 million from midnight screenings and $32 million on its opening day on Friday, September 25, 2015, which is the biggest debut ever for a Chinese film and the third biggest debut overall in China behind Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron. It debuted with an unprecedented 100,000+ first-day screenings on nearly 20,000 screens\u2014and surpassed all newcomers by occupying 87% share of the day's box office receipts. It earned US$70.6 million in two days. During its opening weekend it grossed an estimated US$106.8 million from a massive 284,000 screenings in three days becoming the second Chinese film after Monster Hunt to open with more than US$100 million. Its 3-day haul of US$106 million is also the second biggest 3-day gross of any film in China irrespective of any day. Only Furious 7, which debuted to US$121 million in its Sunday-Tuesday opening in April, has ever notched a bigger 3-day opening in China. It topped the Chinese box office for the second weekend earning US$41 million. It is the second highest- grossing Chinese film of all time behind Monster Hunt and the third highest- grossing film in China in 2015 behind Monster Hunt and Furious 7. In the United States and Canada, it opened to a limited release on the same day as its Chinese opening and made $559,000 from 27 theaters\u2014at an average of $20,700 per theater\u2014capturing the weekend's best opening per-theater-average. Well Go USA Entertainment, the distributor of the film in the US said it was \"thrilled\" with the early results. ===Critical response=== Despite setting many records, the film has also attracted many negative reviews from Chinese critics and a more mixed reaction than its predecessor Lost in Thailand. Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times called the film a \"rollicking crowd- pleaser\" that \"might just be smart and substantive enough to be one of the year's best.\" On the other hand, Helen T. Verongos of The New York Times was not impressed, labeling it \"a very, very, very, long-feeling movie\" that \"tries too hard to be too many things\". Variety's Maggie Lee considered the film \"tamer but still agreeable\" compared to Lost in Thailand, noting the comedy is particularly tailored to the mainland China market, \"which even Hong Kong viewers will miss.\" She also predicted that \"mainlanders in their 40s\" will embrace it much more readily compared to \"millennials\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Chinese adventure comedy films Category:2010s adventure comedy films Category:Chinese films Category:2015 films Category:Beijing Enlight Pictures films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Shanghai Category:Films directed by Xu Zheng Category:2015 comedy films ",
