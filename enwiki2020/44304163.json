Hiking have become a further hallmark of Rotpunktverlag's distributions, usually present region- related hiking and promotion of a smooth, sustainable tourism. == Organisation == For the purpose of long-term financial security, in 1997 the conversion into a corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) was decided: about 550 shareholders have been subscribed share capital for approximately 1,500,000 Swiss Francs. In May 2012, an authorized capital increase has been applied for, to which alongside the existing shareholders, other people may participate (legal and natural personalities), in all an additional a share capital in the amount of CHF 656,000, with the proviso that former shareholders may exercise pre- emptive rights of one share for two existing one.
