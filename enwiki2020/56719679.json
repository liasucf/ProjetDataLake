Herremans is currently an assistant professor in the Singapore University of Technology and Design,Dr. Dorien Herremans, Assistant Professor, SUTD and research scientist (joint appointment) at the Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR. She also works as a certified instructor for the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute and is director of SUTD Game Lab.SUTD Game Lab Before going to SUTD, she was a recipient of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London, where she worked on the project MorpheuS: Hybrid Machine Learning \u2013 Optimization techniques To Generate Structured Music Through Morphing And Fusion.EU MorhpeuS Project She received her Ph.D. in Applied Economics on the topic of Computer Generation and Classification of Music through Operations Research Methods. She graduated as a commercial engineer in management information systems at the [University of Antwerp] in 2005. After that, she worked as a Drupal consultant and was an IT lecturer at the Les Roches University in Bluche, Switzerland. She also worked as a mandaatassistent at the University of Antwerp, in the domain of operations management, supply chain management and operations research. Herremans' current work focuses on automatic music generation, data mining for music classification (hit prediction) and other novel applications in the intersections of AI, machine learning/optimization and music. She is a senior member of the IEEE. Herremans' research on dance hit prediction, automatic piano fingering and AI automatic music generation systems (e.g. MorpheuSMusic and artificial intelligence#MorpheuS) has received attention in the popular press, including international magazines such as Motherboard from Vice Magazine, Channel News Asia's Documentary 'Algorithms: Episode 1: Rage Against The Machine, The Examiner, Belgian national TV Reyers Laat and Belgian and French national radio.France Info \u2013 Comment predire qu'une chanson sera un tubeRadio een ==Selected publications== * Herremans D., Chuan C.H, Chew E. 2017.
