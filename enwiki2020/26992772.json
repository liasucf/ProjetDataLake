The family immigrated to Germany for political reasons when Mehrzad was just six residing in Hamburg. At 13 he joined a gospel choir and eventually took classes at the S\u00e4ngerakademie studying voice and piano. Taking the stage name Marasco, he released self- produced recordings finding some limited success. He recorded \"She's Gone\", a cover of \"She's Like the Wind\" from Patrick Swayze. He opened a karaoke bar, but the business went bankrupt and he had to live on welfare for a while. ==Deutschland sucht den Superstar== Marashi auditioned to the seventh season of the show Deutschland sucht den Superstar initially under his stage name Marasco. Very notably during a live show on DSDS on April 10, 2010, during the Top 3 stage, Marashi proposed to marry his girlfriend. The two married on 7 July 2010 in Hamburg.
