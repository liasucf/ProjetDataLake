The flag of Paris is vertically divided between the traditional colours of Paris, blue and red, both of which also feature in the city's coat of arms. Blue is identified with Saint Denis, red with Saint Martin. The colours of Paris are the origin of the blue and red stripes in the French flag, the white stripe symbolising the monarchy. The French flag's colours were adopted as a cockade during the early stages of the French Revolution, when the country was still in the process of becoming a constitutional monarchy. ==References== Paris Paris Category:Culture of Paris ",
