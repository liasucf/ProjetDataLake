Liberation Day (known locally as Kwibohora) is a public holiday in Rwanda which is celebrated on 4 July.https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/07/04/535501938/the-other- country-where-july-4-is-a-national-holiday It commemorates the defeat of the previous Habyarimana regime and the Rwandan Armed Forces by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in the Rwandan Civil War, thus ending the Rwandan genocide.https://publicholidays.africa/rwanda/liberation-day/ On 4 July 1994, the RPF secured the capital of Kigali while the end of the war only became official on 18 July with the liberation of the north-west territories. Liberation Day takes place a week after Independence Day, although it is more of a celebration rather than the national mourning period for the Rwandan Revolution on Independence Day.https://www.officeholidays.com/amp/holidays/rwanda/rwanda-liberation-day ==Background history== The Rwandan Civil War was a conflict between the Rwandan Armed Forces, representing the government of Rwanda, and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The war, which lasted from 1990 to 1994, arose from the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. The war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing into the country. After the signing of the Arusha Accords in August 1993, an uneasy peace followed, during which it's terms were implemented gradually, with peace-keeping United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda being sent to the country to implement it. This was sidetracked following the assassination of President Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, after which between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the Rwandan genocide, escalating the war. After months of war, the RPF, under Paul Kagame at this time, spent the latter half of June fighting to liberate the capital. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan Army and liberated Kigali on 4 July. The RPF declared victory, with Paul Kagame being named as the new leader. 4 July was immediately designated by the new government as Liberation Day. ==Commemorations== On Liberation Day, many government sponsored patriotic and cultural events, including special ceremonies, and concerts are organized. Across the country, there are celebrations of the liberation anniversary, with the main celebrations taking place in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Rwanda+Liberation+Day Delegations from all over the continent visit the capital to attend the celebrations.https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/rwanda-marks-25th-anniversary-of- liberation/1523416 The annual military parade of the Rwanda Defence Force is held at Amahoro Stadium.

The parade is led by the RDF color guard and a massed colors contingent. In recent years, the normal horizontal goose step performed at parades was replaced with a more Chinese style goose step as the troops participating were trained by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3017597/rwandan-troops- trained-chinese-military-mark-25th-anniversary There is also an official state reception and a holiday football game between Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
