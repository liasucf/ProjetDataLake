    "text": "Rice Krispies (also known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) is a breakfast cereal marketed by Kellogg's in 1927 and released to the public in 1928. Rice Krispies are made of crisped rice (rice and sugar paste that is formed into rice shapes or \"berries\", cooked, dried and toasted), and expand forming very thin and hollowed out walls that are crunchy and crisp. When milk is added to the cereal the walls tend to collapse, creating the \"Snap, crackle, and pop\" sounds.How does Kellogg's* Rice Krispies* cereal \"talk\"? Kellogg Canada Rice Krispies cereal has a long advertising history, with the elf cartoon characters Snap, Crackle and Pop touting the brand. In 1963, The Rolling Stones recorded a short song for a Rice Krispies television advertisement.\"Exile on Madison Avenue,\" Ben Greenman, The New Yorker (online), 2 April 2008 (Accessed 22 July 2008)Rolling Stones Rice Krispies Commercial ==Background== Rice Krispies are made by the Kellogg Company. The \"Snap, Crackle and Pop\" slogan was in use by 1939 when the cereal was advertised as staying \"crackly crisp in milk or cream...not mushy!\" with claims that the cereal would remain floating (without sinking to the bottom of the bowl) even after 2 hours in milk. They were not a shredded or flaked cereal type, but were instead created by a patented process that Kellogg's called \"oven-popping\".Life Magazine, June 12 1939Patented Sept. 5, 1933 UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE CEREAL FOOD - Preparation of puffed cereals from wholegrain or grain pieces without preparation of meal or dough by heating without using a pressure release device The original patent called for using partially dried grain, which could be whole or broken, that would have 15\u201330% moisture which could then be shaped by existing processes for cereal production that include rolling, flaking, shredding, etc. After being processed to the desired shape the grain is dried to around 5\u2013-14% moisture content at which stage the grain will expand when subjected to a high temperature creating a light, low-density product that is crisp and easy to chew. ==Ingredients== A bowl of Rice Krispies Rice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin hydrochloride (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin), and vitamin D. According to Kellogg's, the rice used in the US version of the cereal is grown in the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. ===Health claims=== In 2010 the Kellogg Company was found by the Federal Trade Commission to be making unsubstantiated and misleading health claims in advertising on Rice Krispies boxes. Claims made by the company included \"now helps support your child's immunity\" and \"has been improved to include antioxidants and nutrients that your family needs to help them stay healthy.\" The FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%.Carey, Susan.
