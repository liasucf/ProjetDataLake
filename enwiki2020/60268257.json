    "text": "A superteam in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is a franchise whose roster typically has three or more Hall of Fame caliber players that are in or near their prime. A more conservative form would be 'All-Star' or All-NBA level players who have recently or are currently still chosen to represent the best of the Eastern and Western conferences as All-Star players or were voted in as part of the All-NBA team at the end of every season. This term has now been used for some teams of the past but the most notable move, and arguably the 'first player-formed' Superteam, was ushered in when LeBron James had decided to join his fellow draft-class members, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, at the Miami Heat at the end of the 2009-2010 season. The three were named \"the Big 3\" and would establish their dominance by making it to the NBA Finals for all of the four years that they were together, winning back-to-back titles in the 2012 NBA Finals and the 2013 NBA Finals. LeBron had joined the Heat as a back-to-back MVP winner and equal six-time All-Star with Dwyane Wade, whilst Chris Bosh had been a four-time All-Star. Due to this, many other Superteams had been formed/drafted since then in order to secure a championship with the most prominent being the Golden State Warriors team from 2014 to 2016. This team included three perennial All-Stars in Stephen Curry (Also 2-time MVP, and first unanimous MVP winner), Klay Thompson and Draymond Green before securing one of the top players in the NBA in Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder in free agency. At the start of the 2018\u20132019 season, the Warriors then signed All-Star, Demarcus Cousins from the New Orleans Pelicans in free agency and was the first NBA franchise in 42 years to start five players that had been, at one time, perennial All-Stars. Other teams include the attempt by Oklahoma City Thunder with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony in the 2017\u20132018 season, albeit with little success, and the Cleveland Cavaliers with, again, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love from 2014 to 2018. Aside from the aforementioned Golden State Warriors, current teams with emerging Superteams include the Philadelphia 76ers and, according to some writers, the Boston Celtics. Although Superteams are a fairly new concept, some teams of the past have now been labelled as Superteams due to the multiple 'Superstars' that were on the team and their dominance on the league, such as the 2007\u20132012 Celtics and the most famous being the 1995\u20131998 Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. == Superteams of the modern NBA == === 2010: LeBron joins the Miami Heat, first player-formed superteam === Dwyane Wade (left) and LeBron James (right) led the Miami Heat to four Finals appearances and two Championships during their stint together. After the 2009\u20132010 season had concluded, LeBron James was in free agency and had free choice to choose which team he would play for next. He had just come off one of his highest-accumulating statistic production of his career, had been voted an All-Star six times and had won back-to-back MVP awards at the Cleveland Cavaliers. Although there was much speculation and hype surrounding James and his choice, it was kept hidden for many weeks until he announced his plans on a live television broadcast via ESPN that would be called \"The Decision\". He had chosen to join the Miami Heat where his fellow draft-class member and good friend, Dwyane Wade, was currently playing. Dwyane Wade had already had proved himself a superstar at the Miami Heat where he had won the NBA Championship in the 2005\u20132006 season as well as winning the Finals MVP. Other achievements also include being a 6-time All-Star, 5-time All-NBA and the NBA Scoring Champion in the previous season before LeBron James joined the Miami Heat. Chris Bosh, another member of the same draft-class, would also come to join James and Wade where he had just been a 4-time All-Star and the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks and minutes played when he had left the Toronto Raptors. The three would join together and make 4-straight NBA Finals appearances, with the first one coming the very season that they banded together. They lost the 2011 NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks before winning two straight over the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs respectively and becoming the first Eastern Conference team to win back-to-back titles since the Chicago Bulls of the late 90s. During this time, they had dominated much of the NBA and the Eastern Conference only to have a rematch with the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 Finals which they had lost. Wade (Left), James (Center) and Bosh (Right) celebrating on the bench as the Miami Heat vs the Washington Wizards Following their loss, LeBron James was once again in free agency and had left the Miami Heat to return to his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers and thus ending the run of the Miami \"Big 3\". During their time together, James had won back-to-back MVP and Finals MVP (2012 and 2013) as well as all 3 members being voted as an All-Star for every season that they were together. The 'Three' would also make NBA history with such feats as accumulating 27 straight victories between February 1 to March 27 of the 2012\u20132013 season, which was then the second-longest run in NBA history as well as being only the second time that three teammates had each scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a regulation match, which was last set over 50 years prior. Many other players and franchises would follow in the footprints of LeBron James and join other Superstar-caliber players to form their own Superteam in a quest to win an NBA Championship and challenge the Miami Heat Superteam. However, it would be LeBron James who would disband it and also form the next 'Big 3' in the league. === 2014\u20132018: Cavaliers vs. Warriors === alt= Following James' stint with the Miami Heat, he had decided to head back to his hometown team (the Cleveland Cavaliers), and once again form another 'Big 3' to compete for the title. Cleveland had already had Kyrie Irving on their roster who was drafted by the Cavaliers in 2011 (taken 1st overall). Before James joined the Cavaliers, Irving had already won Rookie-of- the-Year in 2012, was a two-time All-Star (and All-Star MVP in 2014) as well as being the youngest player in NBA history to score at least 40 points at Madison Square Garden. Joining them via trade would be Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves to complete the new LeBron James' 'Big 3'. Love had finished the previous season with his best production since joining the league with career high-averages in points and assists as well as making the All-Star game in 2012. In his 6-year stint with the Wolves, he had also recorded the longest streak of 'Double-Doubles' (double figure in two of either points, rebounds, assists, blocks or steals) at 52 in a row as well as the first player since Moses Malone in 1982 to record a 30 points and 30 rebounds night in a regulation game. With the acquisition of Kevin Love, who was considered one of the best power forwards in the league, and Kyrie Irving, perennial All- Star and 'future superstar', LeBron James had formed another 'Big 3' that had instantly made the Cleveland Cavaliers a title favorite. During the same season that LeBron had returned to the Cavaliers, the Golden State Warriors had also an emerging team that would later become the dynasty that would dominate the league and establish itself as another Superteam. Although James' team was built through trades and Free Agency, the Warriors would build their team through the draft and development to obtain the core that would come to challenge the Cavaliers for the best team in the league and the Championship. The Warriors had drafted Stephen Curry as the No. 7 pick in 2009, Klay Thompson as the No. 11 pick in 2011 and Draymond Green as the No. 35 pick in 2012 to form the nucleus of this team while adding Andrew Bogut (former No. 1 draft pick in 2005) and Andre Iguodala (2-time Defensive Player of the Year) to their roster to complete the core players that would ultimately challenge for the title in the 2014\u20132015 season. Although the Warriors would eventually be noted as a Superteam, during this season, their core players had yet to make an All-Star or All-NBA team except for Stephen Curry (All-NBA and All- Star in 2013) and Andre Iguodala (All-Star in 2012). This would all change in the 2014\u20132015 campaign when the Warriors had completed the regular season with the No. 1 seed with 67 wins out of 82 games and would make it through as the winners of the Western Conference to face LeBron's Cavaliers (the Eastern Conference champions) in the NBA Finals. alt= The young Warriors team would win the Finals over the Cavaliers in 6 games and bring home the NBA Championship to Oakland for the first time in 40 years (last won in 1975). This would firmly establish the Warriors as a Superteam as their core players won a multitude of awards in their breakthrough season: Stephen Curry (MVP, All-Star selection, All-NBA First team), Klay Thompson (All-Star Selection, All-NBA team), Draymond Green (All-Defensive team selection) and Andre Iguodala (Finals MVP). Cleveland's 'Big 3' had also won accolades that further bolstered their claim as a legitimate Superteam despite losing the Finals: Kyrie Irving (All-Star Selection, All-NBA Third team) and LeBron James (All- Star Selection, All-NBA First team). Following the 2015 Finals, these two Superteams would dominate their respective conferences the next year and have a rematch in the finals. Fans celebrating on the streets of Cleveland after the Cavaliers end the city's 52 year major title drought The Warriors had started the 2015\u20132016 season by breaking the opening number of wins (at 26, before losing on December 12 to the Milwaukee Bucks) as well as a number of other NBA records by the end of the season. These include the most road wins in a season (at 34), most consecutive number of home wins (at 54) and most important of all, the best regular season record at 73\u20139 which topped the record held by the Michael Jordan led Bulls when they had 72\u20139 record. The Cleveland Cavaliers had also topped the Eastern Conference and would again make it to the NBA Finals after defeating the Detroit Pistons, the Atlanta Hawks and the Toronto Raptors. The Warriors would also make it to the Finals but en-route they would face some problems in the Western Conference Finals where they found themselves down 3\u20131 in the series against the Oklahoma City Thunder after having beat the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers in the previous rounds. The Warriors would go onto win the series and once again face the Cavs for the NBA title which would ultimately end with the Eastern team coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit and become the first team to win the title from that position. Again, a number of accolades were awarded to players of both teams and further enhancing their status as superstars and Superteams whereby both \"Big 3s\" were selected into the All-Star match as well as Stephen Curry becoming the first-ever unanimous MVP, LeBron James winning Finals MVP in the series and Draymond Green joining both LeBron and Curry as part of the All-NBA teams. That following off-season (before the 2016\u20132017 campaign), the Warriors made a move to re-assert their spot as the most dominant franchise in the league by acquiring Kevin Durant when he became a free agent. Durant had been a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder and was part of the team that had the edge over the Warriors (3\u20131 lead) in the Western Conference Finals but unfortunately lost their lead and missed out on returning to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2012. Durant joined the Warriors highly decorated and arguably as one of the best players in the league with a resume that consisted of an MVP (in 2014), five-time NBA Scoring Champion, seven-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA which was said to have had put a highly talented Warriors Superteam into a league of their own. The Warriors were now heavy favorites to win the NBA Championship in the 2016\u20132017 season and take back the title from their Superteam rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Much like the past two seasons, the Warriors and the Cavaliers made it through their respective conferences and met again in the Finals. Kevin Durant (Left) joins Stephen Curry (Right) and the Golden State Warriors in 2016 On the way to reaching the playoffs, the Warriors had matched or broken several NBA records. With the addition of Kevin Durant to a rather successful Warriors team, they would again reclaiming top seed overall with a 67 win regular season along with breaking the most games won by a 40-point margin or higher, and extending their run of most games without back-to-back losses in the regular season to 146 (stretching from 9 April 2015 to 2 March 2017). When the post-season came around, again the Warriors showed their Superteam strength by breaking the record for best start to the post-season (at 15\u20130), longest win streak in the playoffs (15) and best ever post-season record (16-1), whilst the Cavaliers made a strong run of their own by entering the Finals with only one loss from all of their series (entered the Finals at 12\u20131) before eventually relinquishing the title to the Warriors in a 4\u20131 series loss. The season ended with more accolades spread between the two teams including the Warriors having four players elected into the All-Star match (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson) which tied an NBA record, as well as the Cavs having their \"Big 3\" also included (LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love). All-NBA selections were also given to Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, LeBron James and Kevin Durant who also won the Finals MVP thus further supporting the claim that of the two Superteams, Kevin Durant had tipped the balance in favor of the Warriors. Victory Parade. Kevin Durant (pictured) would also win the Finals MVP|alt= Although both the Warriors and the Cavaliers would remain favorites in their respective conferences, there was another shift in the Superteams when starting point- guard and member of the Cleveland's 'Big 3', Kyrie Irving, had decided to leave Cleveland and seek a trade. He would eventually be traded to the Boston Celtics in large part for Celtic's own starting point-guard, Isaiah Thomas who was injured at the time of the trade. Although Thomas had won an All-NBA selection the previous season, he was not seen as the same caliber of player as Kyrie Irving nor was there as much hype for the new 'Big 3' where eventually Thomas would struggle to come back from his injury and would be subsequently traded. This left the Cavaliers to still be led by LeBron James who had still managed to help his team make it through the Eastern Conference to the Finals albeit with a more troubled path than usual with near loses in series to the Indiana Pacers (4\u20133 series win) in the First Round and the Boston Celtics (4\u20133 series win) in the Eastern Conference Finals and only finishing 4th in the Eastern Conference standings. The Warriors also did not finish atop of the Western Conference (2nd in the West) and also had difficulty winning the Western Conference Finals over the Houston Rockets with only a slim 4\u20133 series win. Despite this, the Warriors finished the regular season with 58 wins and had cemented themselves as the team with the most regular season victories over a three-year span and would continue to write themselves into NBA records when they swept the Finals' series over the Cleveland Cavaliers (4\u20130) to take a second-straight title and win three of the four finals matches with their 'Superteam' counterpart. Kevin Durant would again win the Finals MVP and make the All-NBA team along with LeBron James and Stephen Curry again and while the two teams had battled for the previous 4-straight Finals (an NBA first), it would mark the end of their rivalry when James would decide to leave the Cavaliers and join the LA Lakers on a four- year deal after he became a free agent again. Note: the starting players of the Golden State Warriors (Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson) were also known as the \"Hampton 5\" or the \"Death Lineup\". === 2018 Season: Warriors form an 'All-Star' team === As in 2016 when the Warriors signed Kevin Durant in free agency, the Warriors had reaffirmed their place as a Superteam when they signed Demarcus Cousins as a free agent from the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2018 off-season. Although he was injured when he joined the Warriors, he was still considered a dominant 'big man' with great skill and defensive tenacity which won him two All-NBA selections and been a four-time All-Star representative prior to the signing. He had joined a Superteam cast and the Golden State Warriors would be the first franchise in 42 years to be able to start five All-Star representatives (having all been All-Stars the previous year), one in each of the traditional basketball positions. It would be almost a year after his injury when Cousins would finally take the floor when the Warriors faced the Los Angeles Clippers on January 19, 2019 that the Warriors would be able to start all 5 All-Stars in the game. === Other franchises look to create their own 'Big 3' === Carmelo Anthony would be traded to OKC Thunder and the Houston Rockets in an attempt to form a 'Big 3' during the twilight of his career During the 2017 off- season, a year after Kevin Durant left for the Warriors, the Oklahoma City Thunder had moved to acquire Paul George, from the Indiana Pacers, and Carmelo Anthony, from the New York Knicks, to join Russel Westbrook in their bid to form their own 'Big 3' against the established Superteams: the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony joined the Thunder as an aging star but had boasted 10 All-Star Appearances and 6 All-NBA selections whereas George was arriving at the prime of his career which had 4 All-Star appearances and 3 All-NBA selections as well. However, that would all come to an end the following season after a less-than-impressive showing by Carmelo that saw him traded to the Houston Rockets in their attempt to form a 'Big 3' along with James Harden and Chris Paul at the beginning of the 2018\u20132019 season. Harden had been a part of the Houston organisation since he was traded from the OKC Thunder in 2012. He would have five All-Star appearances and four All-NBA selections by the time that Anthony joined his team. Paul joined the rockets from the LA Clippers at the start of the 2017\u20132018 season and had arrived with 5 All-Star appearances and 4 All-NBA selections. This would also fail when after a few weeks into the season, the Rockets decided to trade Carmelo Anthony to the Chicago Bulls who would eventually waive him and thus ending the Houston 'Big 3'. During the 2018 offseason, the Toronto Raptors traded DeMar DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs for four-time All-Star and two- time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. They began the 2018-19 NBA season 12-1, and finished the season with a 58-24 record. With Pascal Siakam winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award with averages of 16.9 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.5 assists, the Raptors formed a 'Big 3' of Leonard, Siakam and 6-time All-Star Kyle Lowry. In the playoffs, the Raptors continued their successes, by beating the Orlando Magic in five games and the Philadelphia 76ers in seven games, capped by Leonard's historic buzzer-beater. They went on the beat the 60-22 Milwaukee Bucks with MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in six games. Finally, they defeated the injury-plagued Warriors in six games in the NBA Finals to win their first NBA championship. Unfortunately, Kawhi decided to not return to the Raptors next season, and he ended up going to the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 13, 2018, the Philadelphia 76ers made a mid- season trade for Jimmy Butler from the Minnesota Timberwolves to have him join up with their emerging superstars, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Butler joined the team as a veteran with 4 All-Star, 2 All-NBA and 4 All-Defensive team selections to add to Embiid's growing talent (accumulating an All-Star, All- NBA and All-Defensive team selection) and Simmon's budding-superstar potential that would see him earn an All-Star appearance later that season. The 76ers would also move for Tobias Harris (had one of his best productive seasons averaging 20.9 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists), from the Clippers, on deadline day to add another 'star' to the Philadelphia starting lineup to create their own version of a 'Big 4'. == Pre-modern NBA: Now considered superteams == Michael Jordan would be the leader of one of the most famous Pre-Modern Superteam when his Chicago Bulls team won their second three-peat While superteams existed in the NBA before 2010, the Heat with James was the first that players created. Multiple teams had at least three Hall-of-Famers or other star players that joined forces to dominate the league and become a strong force that won an NBA Championship. Some consider the team that actually 'fathered' the Superteam race was the Boston Celtics between 2008 and 2012 who traded for Kevin Garnett (a nine-time All-NBA and All-Star), and Ray Allen (seven-time All-Star and two-time All-NBA) from the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Seattle Sonics respectively, to join Paul Pierce (five- time All-Star and two-time All-NBA). and Rajon Rondo (a budding superstar who had yet to win his All-NBA and All-Star appearances). They won their ring in the 2007\u20132008 season and would go to the finals again in the 2009\u20132010 season only to lose to the Los Angeles Lakers spearheaded by Kobe Bryant. One of the most famous of the 'past Superteams' would be the 1995 to 1998 Chicago Bulls that three-peated the NBA Championship and consisted of Hall-of-Famers Michael Jordan (9-time All-Star, 3-time MVP, 3-time Finals MVP and 8-time All-NBA) and Scottie Pippen (4-time All-Star and All-NBA) who was then joined by Dennis Rodman (2-time All-Star and All-NBA) from the San Antonio Spurs. The trio would then go onto win 3-straight finals and set the then-record for most regular season wins at 72\u201310. The Philadelphia 76ers could also boast a 'Superteam' before their current roster was put together. In 1982, Moses Malone (two-time MVP and five-time All-Star) had joined the cast of Julius Erving (MVP, five-time All-Star and four-time All-NBA) and Bobby Jones (3-time All-Star and 5-time All-Defensive team) and they would go to average 60 regular season victories over 3 years and won their Championship Ring in the '82-'83 season. Charles Barkley (future Hall-of-Famer) would later join the Philadelphia team but no more rings were won by this Superteam. Magic Johnson encapsulated the \"Showtime Lakers\" that was the Superteam of the West during the 1980s In the 1980s, the Los Angeles Lakers had a formidable team in the \"Showtime\" Lakers that had a roster that boasted multiple stars that included the trio of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six-time MVP, nine-time All-Star and All-NBA) with Magic Johnson and James Worthy who each would go onto win multiple All- Star and All-NBA selections including a Finals MVP for Johnson in his rookie year. In a decade of this Superteam together, they had won 5 NBA Championships and developed a culture of 'Hollywood-glamour' and entertaining basketball. During this time, they had a 'rival Superteam' in the Boston Celtics who would challenge the 'Showtime' Lakers for NBA Championship Rings where they had won three during their reign. Although their core players were all young and had yet to make their mark, they would go onto win a number of accolades during the 80s that cemented their place as one of the most dominant teams of the decade, let alone the league. Throughout the 1980s, these accolades included for Larry Bird (nine All-Stars, three MVPs, 10 All-NBA and two Finals MVP), Robert Parish (seven All-Stars, two All-NBA), Kevin McHale (five All-Star, two All-NBA), and Dennis Johnson (five All-Star, two All-NBA and one Finals MVP), making them the superteam of the East to their counterpart Lakers in the West. Note: * All \"All-NBA\" and \"All-Star\" stats were at the time of the Superteam being formed. Does not show total appearances in their career. * Not all \"Superteams\" were added into this section. * Included the teams that have won an NBA Championship == \"Super-Duos\" == There are some acclaim the \"Super-Duos\" that lies just below the Superteam status and consists of only two superstars surrounded by other role players in their team. One such example is the Houston Rocket's former tandem of James Harden and Chris Paul. Following the departure of Carmelo Anthony, the Rockets kept their star back-court to challenge the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference. This also applied to the Oklahoma City Thunder who backed their 'Super-Duo' when, Carmelo Anthony was traded to the Houston Rockets after his first 'Big 3' experience had failed. Russell Westbrook (6 All-NBA, 6 All-Star) and Paul George were also two All-Star players in Oklahoma City that tried to bring home a championship to the Northwest Division.Another team in their division with a Super-Duo includes the Portland Trail Blazers with their own star back- court of Damian Lilliard and CJ McCollum. Lilliard boasts 4 All-Star appearances along with 3 All-NBA selections whilst his teammate McCollum has yet to accumulate any of his own but is still considered an ascending star. When the Boston Celtics traded for Kyrie Irving from the Cleveland 'Big 3', they had placed their trust in the newly attained Super-Duo when he was linked up with Gordon Hayward who was signed from the Utah Jazz as a free agent. Hayward added an All-Star appearance to Kyrie's 6 appearances and 1 All-NBA selection. They were surrounded by what many consider as young talent that could emerge as future stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier with an All-Star veteran to hold the team together in Al Horford (five All- Star and an All-NBA). However, the tandem was delayed when Hayward had a season-ending injury in the first 5 minutes of his debut in the first game of the 2017\u20132018 season. This tandem ended after Kyrie Irving left in free agency for the Brooklyn Nets after the 2018\u201319 season. However, one of the greatest tandems to form was the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal pairing at the LA Lakers during the early 2000s. O'Neal was signed as a free agent from the Orlando Magic and was widely considered one of the most dominant big-men of all time to have played in the NBA. He joined the Lakers with a young Kobe Bryant and together would form a potent duo that would win a three-peat together before in-fighting and arguments had dismantled the super duo with O'Neal being traded to the Miami Heat. However, O'Neal would become a hall-of- famer and Laker legend by accumulating 15 All-Star, 14 All-NBA, an MVP, three Finals MVP and four NBA Championships whilst Bryant remained at the Lakers and had 18 All-Star, 15 All-NBA, an MVP, two Finals MVP. and five NBA Championships to have both numbers of his jersey retired. Another great 'super-duo' is one that is currently in the NBA, and that's the pairing of LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the Los Angeles Lakers. This duo is considered to be the best in the NBA right now, and some people might say that it's one of the best duos of all time. James is considered to be one of the best basketball players in NBA history. He has four NBA championships, four Finals MVP's, four MVPs, 16 NBA All-Star appearances, and 16 All-NBA Team appearances. Davis, on the other hand, has seven NBA All-Star appearances, four All-NBA appearances, four All-Defensive appearances, and one NBA championship. Together, the duo led the Lakers from being one of the worst teams in the West to the best team in the conference, with a 52-19 record and a 17-2 start, one of the best starts in Lakers history. The team went 16-5 in the 2020 NBA playoffs, and won the team's 17th championship, tying the Celtics for most all-time. The duo of Davis and James became the first duo in NBA history to score 25+ points while shooting 50% or more from the field in the same postseason since Kobe and Shaq did it in 2002. == Controversies == There have been some controversies about the new 'Superteam' era that has been brought into the NBA. Claims persists that superstar players are no longer looking to make the game competitive but rather finding an easier way to attain an NBA Championship Ring and nullifying other contenders by joining with other superstars. From LeBron's 'decision' to the Miami Heat and Durant joining the regular-season record holders in Golden State Warriors, there was derision from the media and fans in their choice to take an 'easy way' to the Finals and unbalance the NBA. However, there have been cases for both sides as others argue that the NBA still has its highest TV grossing revenue and that it was all done under the rules of the Salary Cap and that it's rather some entertainment in sports that should be enjoyed. == References == Category:National Basketball Association players Category:National Basketball Association teams ",
