    "text": "Didier Raoult (; born 13 March 1952) is a French physician and microbiologist specializing in infectious diseases. In 1984, Raoult created the Rickettsia Unit at Aix-Marseille University (AMU). He also teaches infectious diseases in the Faculty of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University. Since 2008, Raoult has been the director of the Unit\u00e9 de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes. He gained significant worldwide attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the disease. == Personal life == Raoult was born in 13 March 1952 in Dakar, French West Africa (present-day Senegal). Raoult's father, who came from Brittany, was serving there as a military doctor; his mother, originally from Marseille, was a nurse. His family returned to France in 1961, and settled in Marseille. For a time, he was schooled in Nice, then he attended a boarding school in Brian\u00e7on. Not being a good student, Raoult repeated a year at high school, dropped out in the second year to join the French merchant marine, on a boat called Renaissance, and spent the next two years at sea. In 1972, he sat his baccalaur\u00e9at in literature as a free candidate, and gained entrance into the medical faculty in Marseille.Portrait par l'INSERM \u2013 2010 : fichier pdf (source: ) Believing in a family tradition in medicine, Raoult senior refused to pay for the studies in any other subject. Raoult had wanted to become an obstetrician after qualifying, but this choice was denied him because he did not make the grade in his Internship examination. Instead, he specialised in infectious diseases in the footsteps of his great-grandfather Paul Legendre (1854\u20131936).Catherine Lallement, \u00ab LE GENDRE Louis Paul, Docteur \u00bb, La France savante, CTHS, en ligne.\u00ab Paul Legendre, le premier infectiologue, qui cr\u00e9a l\u2019h\u00f4pital des contagieux de la porte d\u2019Aubervilliers, \u00e0 Paris (...). \u00bb cf. Vaudoit 2018, chap.II In 1982, Raoult married psychiatrist and novelist Natacha Ca\u00efn (born 1960).\"Didier Raoult: Who is his wife, Natacha?\". Closermag.fr, 11 April 2020. They have two children together. ==Career== Since 2008, Raoult has been the director of the Unit\u00e9 de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes, (URMITE; in English, Infectious and Tropical Emergent Diseases Research Unit), which employs more than 200 people. Didier Raoult initiated the construction of a new building to host the Institut hospitalo-universitaire (IHU) M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection.M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection 10-IAHU-03 The IHU Mediterran\u00e9e Infection, which opened in early 2017, is dedicated to the management and study of infectious diseases and combines diagnostic, care, research and teaching activities in one location. He was awarded the \"Grand prix de l'Inserm\" in 2010; Raoult was awarded the \"Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Louis D.\" of the Institut de France in 2015; he shared the \u20ac450,000 prize with biologist Chris Bowler from the Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris;Didier Raoult \u2013 website of the Institut de France the bacteria genus Raoultella was named in his honor. ==Citations== Raoult has more than 2,300 indexed publications. As of 2008, he was \"classified among the ten leading French researchers by the journal Nature, for the number of his publications (a credit of more than two thousand) and for his citations number\". In 2014, according to ISI Web of Knowledge, he is the most cited microbiologist in Europe, and the seventh worldwide. According to the Thomson Reuters source \"Highly Cited Researchers List\", Raoult is among the most influential researchers in his field and his publications are among the 1% most consulted in academic journals. He is one of the 99 most cited microbiologists in the world and one of the 73 most highly cited French scientists. He is a world reference for Q fever and Whipple's disease.Science et Sant\u00e9 magazine n\u00ba 1er d\u00e9cembre 2010 p. 14 As of April 2017, he had over 104,000 citations and an h-index of 148. He is also on the list of the 400 most cited authors in the biomedical world. Raoult's extremely high publication rate results from his \"attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute\", a practice that has been called \"grossly unethical\" by Steven Salzberg. Since 2013 he has been one of the oversea scientists co-afflliated to the King Abdulaziz University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known to \"offer highly cited researchers lucrative adjunct professorships, with minimal requirements for them to be physically present, in return for being listed by them as a secondary affiliation\", and so increase its own institutional citation index. It was reported that of the 1,836 articles published by Raoult between 1995 and 2020 (amounting to more than 120 a year), 230 were published in 2 reviews edited by Michel Drancourt who is his right-hand man at the IHU and colleague for over 35 years. Members of his staff have editorial functions at almost half of the revues that have published his work. It has been suggested that the way that health institutes obtain funding by linking it to the number of publications made by the institute may be at the root of the large number of publications. == Controversies == === American Society for Microbiology publishing ban === In 2006, Raoult and four co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), after a reviewer for Infection and Immunity discovered that four figures from the revised manuscript of a paper about a mouse model for typhus were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment. In response, Raoult \"resigned from the editorial board of two other ASM journals, canceled his membership in the American Academy of Microbiology, ASM\u2019s honorific leadership group, and banned his lab from submitting to ASM journals\". In response to Science covering the story in 2012, he stated that, \"I did not manage the paper and did not even check the last version\". The paper was subsequently published in a different journal. === COVID-19 === On 17 March 2020, Raoult announced in an online video that a trial involving 24 patients from southeast France supported the claim that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective in treating for COVID-19. On 20 March, he published a preliminary report of his study online in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. The French Health Minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, was reported as announcing that \"new tests will now go ahead in order to evaluate the results by Professor Raoult, in an attempt to independently replicate the trials and ensure the findings are scientifically robust enough, before any possible decision might be made to roll any treatment out to the wider public\". Veran refused to endorse the study conducted by Raoult and the possible health ramifications, on the basis of a single study conducted on 24 people. The French media also reported that the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi had offered French authorities millions of doses of the drug for use against COVID-19. On 3 April, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal, issued a statement that the report on the non-blind, non-randomized study \"does not meet the Society's expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\". Raoult was one of 11 prominent scientists named on 11 March to a committee to advise on scientific matters pertaining to the epidemic in France. He did not attend any of the meetings and resigned from the committee on 24 March saying that he refused to participate.. He denounced the \"absence of anything scientific sound,\" and criticised its members for \"not having a clue.\" He defended chloroquine as a benchmark drug for lung diseases, saying that it had suddenly been declared dangerous after having been safely used for 80 years. A meta analysis of 29 studies published in 26 August 2020 showed hydroxychloroquine alone is not effective for the treatment of COVID-19 on hospitalized patients and that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increases the risk of mortality. ==Honours and awards== * 1995 : Knight of the National Order of Merit (France) * 2000 : Knight of the Legion of Honour (France) * 2002 : European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Excellence Award (France) * 2003 : Jean Valade Prize (Fondation pour la recherche m\u00e9dicale, France) * 2005 : Medical grand round (Chicago, USA) * 2008 : Sackler International Prize (Tel Aviv University) * 2009 : Eloi Collery Prize (Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine) * 2010 : Grand prix de l'Inserm (France) * 2011 : Officier of the Legion of Honour (France) * 2015 : Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Louis D.
