    "text": "Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a United States government\u2013funded, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation that broadcasts and publishes online news, information and commentary to readers and listeners in East Asia. Its stated mission is \"to provide accurate and timely news and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit access to a free press.\"Radio Free Asia \u2013 About Retrieved 10 November 2015 Based on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, it was established in the 1990s with the stated aim of promoting democratic values and human rights, and countering the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party. It is funded by a grant from the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly the \"Broadcasting Board of Governors\"), an independent agency of the United States government. In 2017, RFA and other networks, such as Voice of America, were put under the newly created U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency. A short-lived earlier incarnation of Radio Free Asia also existed in the 1950s, as an anti-Communist propaganda operation funded by the Central Intelligence Agency. RFA distributes content in ten Asian languages for audiences in China, North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma. The Economist and The New York Times have credited RFA's reporting for bringing news of the Chinese government's persecution of the Uyghurs to light. ==History== Radio Free Asia was founded and funded in the 1950s by an organization called \"Committee for Free Asia\" as an anti-communist propaganda operation, broadcasting from RCA facilities in Manila, Philippines, and Dacca and Karachi, Pakistan (there may be other sites) until 1961. Some offices were in Tokyo. The parent organization was given as the Asia Foundation. Radio Free Asia went off the air in 1955. In 1971 CIA involvement ended and all responsibilities were transferred to a presidentially appointed Board for International Broadcasting (BIB).Tom Engelhardt: \"The End of Victory Culture\".

With the passage of International Broadcasting Act in 1994, RFA was brought under auspices of the United States Information Agency where it remained until the agency's cessation of broadcasting duties and transitioned to U.S. Department of State operated BBG in 1999. In May 1994, President Bill Clinton announced the continuation of Radio Free Asia after 2009 was dependent on its increased international broadcasting and ability to reach its audience.Executive Order 12, 850, 3 C.F.R. 606, 607 \u00a7 1(b). In September 2009, the 111th Congress amended the International Broadcasting Act to allow a one-year extension of the operation of Radio Free Asia.Bill Text Versions for the 111th Congress, 2009\u20132010. The Library of Congress. The current Radio Free Asia is a US- funded organization, incorporated in March 1996, and began broadcasting in September 1996. Although senators debated a name change, Richard Richter, the then president of Radio Free Asia, was instructed to change the name back from Asia-Pacific Network to Radio Free Asia, as \"we must have the courage to confront tyranny, and to do so under the banner of freedom.\" Radio Free Asia was forced to change in part due to financial pressures from the US government, for although they operate with an independent board, their money mostly comes from the Treasury. RFA broadcasts in nine languages, via shortwave, satellite transmissions, medium-wave (AM and FM radio), and through the Internet. The first transmission was in Mandarin Chinese and it is RFA's most broadcast language at twelve hours per day. RFA also broadcasts in Cantonese, Tibetan (Kham, Amdo, and Uke dialects), Uyghur, Burmese, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer (to Cambodia) and Korean (to North Korea). The Korean service launched in 1997 with Jaehoon Ahn as its founding director. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, American interest in starting a government broadcasting organization grew.Susan B. Epstein: CRS Report for Congress (PDF) The International Broadcasting Act was passed by the Congress of the United States in 1994. Radio Free Asia is formally a private, non-profit corporation. RFA is funded by an annual federal grant from and administered by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which also serves as RFA's corporate board of directors. ==International response== ===Radio jamming and Internet blocking=== Since broadcasting began in 1996, Chinese authorities have consistently jammed RFA broadcasts.Mann, \"China Bars 3 Journalists From Clinton's Trip\", The Los Angeles Times, June 23, 1998 Three RFA reporters were denied access to China to cover U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit in June 1998. The Chinese embassy in Washington had initially granted visas to the three but revoked them shortly before President Clinton left Washington en route to Beijing. The White House and United States Department of State filed complaints with Chinese authorities over the matter but the reporters ultimately did not make the trip.Sieff/Scully \"Radio Free Asia reporters stay home; Clinton kowtows to Beijing's ban, critics contend\", The Washington Times, June 24, 1998 The Vietnamese-language broadcast signal was also jammed by the Vietnamese government since the beginning. Human rights legislation has been proposed in Congress that would allocate money to counter the jamming. Research by the OpenNet Initiative, a project that monitors Internet filtering by governments worldwide, showed that the Vietnamese-language portion of the Radio Free Asia website was blocked by both of the tested ISPs in Vietnam, while the English-language portion was blocked by one of the two ISPs. To address radio jamming and Internet blocking by the governments of the countries that it broadcasts to, the RFA website contains instruction on how to create anti-jamming antennas and information on web proxies. On March 30, 2010, China's domestic internet filter, known as the Great Firewall, temporarily blocked all Google searches in China, due to an unintentional association with the long-censored term \"rfa\". According to Google, the letters, associated with Radio Free Asia, were appearing in the URLs of all Google searches, thereby triggering China's filter to block search results. ===Arrests of Uyghur journalists' relatives=== Radio Free Asia's 6 Uyghur journalists (2018) In 2014\u20132015 China arrested three brothers of RFA Uyghur Service journalist Shohret Hoshur. Their jailing was widely described by Western publishers as Chinese authorities' efforts to target Hoshur for his reports on otherwise unreported violent events of ethnic Han-Uyghur tensions in China's Xinjiang region. Much larger numbers of relatives of RFA's Uygur- language staff have since been detained, including the family of Gulchehra Hoja. RFA is the only station outside China that broadcasts in the Uygur- language. It has been recognized by journalists of The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Economist for playing a role in exposing Xinjiang re-education camps. In particular, The New York Times regards RFA as one of the few reliable sources of information about Xinjiang. ==Mission== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"4\" | Broadcasting Information (Channels 1, 2, 3, 4) |- !

Additionally, the International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (Title III of ), which authorised the creation of the RFA, contains the following paragraph: This appears among a list of both \"Congressional Findings and Declarations of Purpose\", though which it is, is not specified. The subsequent section, outlining \"Standards and Principles\" states that all US-funded broadcasting should be \"consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States\", with news that is \"consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive\"., Sec. 303 ==Criticism== In 1999, Catharin Dalpino of the Brookings Institution, who served in the Clinton State Department as a deputy assistant secretary deputy for human rights, called Radio Free Asia \"a waste of money.\" \"Wherever we feel there is an ideological enemy, we're going to have a Radio Free Something,\" she says. Dalpino said she has reviewed scripts of Radio Free Asia's broadcasts and views the station's reporting as unbalanced. \"They lean very heavily on reports by and about dissidents in exile. It doesn't sound like reporting about what's going on in a country. Often, it reads like a textbook on democracy, which is fine, but even to an American it's rather propagandistic.\" According to a report by the Congressional Research Service of the U.S. government, official state- controlled newspapers in China have run editorials claiming Radio Free Asia is a CIA broadcast operation, as was the case with the first Radio Free Asia. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has referred to Radio Free Asia as \"reptile broadcasting services.\"\"KCNA raps U.S. despicable psychological warfare against DPRK,\" February 22, 2008 BBC Monitoring Service Kim Chol-min, third secretary of North Korea, in statement submitted at the United Nations, accused the United States of engaging in \"psychological warfare\" with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through RFA.General Assembly GA/SPD/430 United Nations Department of Public Information, October 2009 Following the Burmese Saffron Revolution in the fall of 2007, the Myanmar junta held rallies attended by thousands holding signs that condemned external interference and accused Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America, and the BBC of \"airing a skyful of lies.\"On Quiet Streets of Myanmar Fear Is a Constant Companion International Herald Tribune. October 21, 2007 In October 2007, Burmese state-run newspaper The New Light of Myanmar singled out \"big powers\" and Radio Free Asia, among other international broadcasters, as inciting protesters during the Saffron Revolution.Myanmar guards accused of detainee abuse Associated Press.
