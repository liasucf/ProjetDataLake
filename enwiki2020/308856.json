    "text": "The Phantom of the Opera is a 2004 musical drama film based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical of the same name, which in turn is based on the 1910 French novel Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra by Gaston Leroux. Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by Joel Schumacher, it stars Gerard Butler in the title role, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, and Jennifer Ellison. The film was announced in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and was provided with music lessons prior to filming. The Phantom of the Opera grossed $154.6 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, but was very well received by audiences. Critics praised the visuals and acting, particularly the performances of Butler and Rossum, but criticized the writing and directing. ==Plot== In 1919, a public auction is held to clear an abandoned opera theatre's vaults in Paris. Viscount Raoul de Chagny bids against the elderly Madame Giry for a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 music box shaped like a barrel organ with the figure of a cymbal-playing monkey attached to it. The auctioneer presents a shattered chandelier, relating it to \"the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera\". As it is hoisted up to the roof, the story moves back to 1870. The theatre prepares for the performance of the grand opera, Hannibal, headed by soprano Carlotta Giudicelli. Theatre manager Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre plans to retire, leaving the theatre to Richard Firmin and Gilles Andr\u00e9. Carlotta refuses to perform after three years' worth of torment by the theatre's resident \"Opera Ghost\", a mysterious figure said to live in the catacombs below. Facing the performance's cancellation, Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, suggests that dancer Christine Daa\u00e9 stand in as the lead actress. Christine displays her singing talent and is a huge success on opening night. Christine tells Giry's daughter, Meg, that she is being coached by a tutor she calls the \"Angel of Music\". Christine reunites with Raoul, a new patron of the theatre, and her childhood sweetheart, but he dismisses her secrets. That night, the masked Phantom of the Opera appears before Christine, spiriting her away to his underground lair. He confesses his love to Christine, but when she removes his mask out of curiosity, he reacts violently. She returns his mask to him, and the Phantom returns her to the theatre unharmed, but orders the managers to make her the lead in Il Muto. However, the managers choose Carlotta instead. During the performance, the Phantom tampers with Carlotta's throat spray, causing her to sing out of tune, and Christine steps in. The Phantom encounters stagehand Joseph Buquet and hangs him above the stage. Christine and Raoul flee to the roof, where they declare their love for each other. The Phantom, eavesdropping, vows revenge. Three months later, in 1871, at a New Year masquerade ball, Christine and Raoul announce their engagement. The Phantom crashes the ball and orders his own opera, Don Juan Triumphant, to be performed. Upon seeing Christine's engagement ring, the Phantom steals it and flees, pursued by Raoul, but Giry stops him. Giry explains that when she was a teenager, she met the Phantom, a deformed young boy, billed as the 'Devil's Child' in a freak show and abused by the owner. When the Phantom rebelled and strangled the man to death, Giry helped him to evade the resulting mob and hid him within the opera house. The next day, Christine visits her father's tomb with the Phantom posing as his spirit to win her back, but Raoul intervenes. Raoul and the managers plot to capture the Phantom during his opera. The Phantom murders Carlotta's lover, Ubaldo Piangi, and takes his place as the male lead to sing opposite Christine. During their passionate duet, Christine unmasks the Phantom, revealing his deformity to the horrified audience. He drags her to the catacombs, bringing down the chandelier, as a mob forms to hunt the Phantom down. Giry leads Raoul down to the catacombs to rescue Christine. Meg leads the police down to the Phantom's lair as they hunt him down. The Phantom has Christine wear a wedding dress he made for her and proposes marriage. Christine admits that she does not fear the Phantom for his appearance but for his rage and willingness to kill. Raoul arrives, the Phantom threatening to kill him unless Christine weds him. Christine, pitying the Phantom, kisses him. Moved by her kindness, the Phantom allows the lovers to flee. Finding comfort in the music box, the Phantom weeps alone, and Christine gives her ring to him in remembrance. He vanishes as the mob appears with Meg finding his discarded mask. Back in the present, the elderly Raoul visits his late wife Christine's gravestone, placing the music box before it. Before leaving, he notices a freshly laid rose with Christine's ring attached to it, implying that the Phantom is still alive and that he will always love her. ==Cast== * Gerard Butler as Erik, The Phantom * Emmy Rossum as Christine Daa\u00e9 * Patrick Wilson as Raoul de Chagny * Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry * Minnie Driver as Carlotta Giudicelli ** Margaret Preece as Carlotta's singing voice except for \"Learn to Be Lonely\" * Simon Callow as Gilles Andr\u00e9 * Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Richard Firmin * Victor McGuire as Ubaldo Piangi * Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry * Murray Melvin as Monsieur Reyer * Kevin McNally as Joseph Buquet * James Fleet as Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre * Ramin Karimloo as Gustave Daa\u00e9 ==Production== ===Development=== Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to The Phantom of the Opera in early 1989, granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total artistic control. Despite interest from A-list directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher's use of music in The Lost Boys. The duo wrote the screenplay that same year, while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production. Filming was set to begin at Pinewood Studios in England in July 1990, under a $25 million budget. However, the start date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Munich, Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic. Production for The Phantom of the Opera was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman's divorce. \"Everything got tied up in settlements\", Schumacher reflected. \"Then my career took off and I was really busy.\" As a result, The Phantom of the Opera languished in development limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s. In February 1997, Schumacher considered returning, but eventually dropped out in favour of Batman Unchained, Runaway Jury and Dreamgirls. The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role, but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas, who undertook vocal preparation and sang the role of the Phantom in the TV special Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration. Schumacher and Lloyd Webber restarted development for The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. in an attempt to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 million of his own money. The Phantom of the Opera was produced on an $80 million budget. Warner Bros. was given a first-look deal for distribution; when the principal cast was chosen in June 2003, Warner Bros. paid under $8 million to acquire the North American distribution rights. ===Casting=== Hugh Jackman was originally cast for the role of Phantom, but he faced scheduling conflicts with Van Helsing. \"They rang to ask about my availability\", Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview, \"probably about 20 other actors as well. I wasn't available, unfortunately. So, that was a bummer.\" \"We needed somebody who has a bit of rock and roll sensibility in him\", Andrew Lloyd Webber explained. \"He's got to be a bit rough, a bit dangerous; not a conventional singer. Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he's the right side of danger.\"DVD production notes Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler's performance in Dracula 2000. Prior to his audition, Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing \"The Music of the Night\" for Lloyd Webber. Katie Holmes, who began working with a vocal coach, was the front-runner for Christine Daa\u00e9 in March 2003. She was later replaced by Anne Hathaway, a classically trained soprano, in 2004. However, Hathaway dropped out of the role because the production schedule of the film overlapped with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, which she was contractually obligated to make. Hathaway was then replaced with Emmy Rossum. The actress modeled the relationship between the Phantom and Christine after Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine. Patrick Wilson was cast as Raoul based on his previous Broadway theatre career. For the role of Carlotta, Minnie Driver devised an over-the-top, camp performance as the egotistical prima donna. Despite also lacking singing experience, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds was cast by Schumacher as Richard Firmin; the two had previously worked together on Veronica Guerin.The Making of The Phantom of the Opera, [DVD, 2005], Warner Home Video Ramin Karimloo also briefly appears as the portrait of Gustave Daa\u00e9, Christine's father. Karimloo later played the Phantom as well as the role of Raoul on London's West End. ===Filming=== Principal photography lasted from 15 September 2003 to 15 January 2004. The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios, where, on the Pinewood backlot, the bottom half exterior of the Palais Garnier was constructed. The top half was implemented using a combination of computer- generated imagery (CGI) and a scale model created by Cinesite. The surrounding Paris skyline for \"All I Ask of You\" was entirely composed of matte paintings. Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier, since a life-size model was too big for the actual set. Production designer Anthony D. G. Pratt was influenced by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery was based on the P\u00e8re Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball. ==Reception== ===Release=== The Phantom of the Opera was released in the United States on 22 December 2004. With a limited release of 622 theaters, it opened at tenth place at the weekend box office, grossing $6.5 million across five days. After expanding to 907 screens on 14 January 2005 the film obtained the 9th spot at the box office, which it retained during its 1,511 screens wide release on 21 January 2005. The total domestic gross was $51.2 million. With a further $107 million earned internationally, The Phantom of the Opera reached a worldwide total of $154.6 million. A few foreign markets were particularly successful, such as Japan, where the film's \u00a54.20 billion ($35 million) gross stood as the 6th most successful foreign film and 9th overall of the year. The United Kingdom and South Korea both had over $10 million in receipts, with $17.5 million and $11.9 million, respectively. === Accolades === Anthony Pratt and Celia Bobak were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as was John Mathieson for Best Cinematography. However, both categories were awarded to The Aviator. Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song (\"Learn to Be Lonely\") but lost to \"Al otro lado del r\u00edo\" from The Motorcycle Diaries. The song was also nominated for the Golden Globe but it lost to Alfie's \"Old Habits Die Hard\". In the same ceremony, Emmy Rossum was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, losing to Annette Bening in Being Julia. At the Saturn Awards, Rossum won for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, while The Phantom of the Opera was nominated for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film and Alexandra Byrne was nominated for Costume Design. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The film had its initial North America video release on DVD and VHS on 3 May 2005, following its first digital release on HD-DVD on 18 April 2006 and a Blu-ray edition on 31 October 2006. ===Critical reception=== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 170 critics, with an average score of 5/10. \"The music of the night has hit something of a sour note: critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's popular musical histrionic boring and lacking in both romance and danger\", the consensus read. \"Still, some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle\". On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 90%; background:#0; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The film looks and sounds fabulous and I think it's an extraordinarily fine document of the stage show. While it doesn't deviate much from the stage material, the film has given it an even deeper emotional centre. It's not based on the theatre visually or direction-wise, but it's still got exactly the same essence. And that's all I could have ever hoped for.\" |- | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2013 Andrew Lloyd Webber |} Despite having been impressed with the cast, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that \"Teen romance and operetta-style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film-goers, and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to Batman Forever.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com believed that Phantom of the Opera \"takes everything that's wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat.\" In a mixed review for Newsweek, David Ansen praised Rossum's performance, but criticized the filmmakers for their focus on visual design rather than presenting a cohesive storyline. \"Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here\u2014I may not be the most reliable witness. Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler's. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber's neo-Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you're guaranteed to go out humming.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting The Phantom of the Opera. \"Schumacher, the man who added nipples to Batman's suit, has staged Phantom chastely, as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note\". Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, reasoned that \"part of the pleasure of movie-going is pure spectacle\u2014of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed.\" In contrasting between the popularity of the Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that \"it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling\u2014in some way transported and moved. Now, in Schumacher's film, that spell lives on.\" ==See also== * The Phantom of the Opera (2004 soundtrack) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * * Category:2004 films Category:2000s romantic drama films Category:British films Category:British musical films Category:British romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about opera Category:Films based on adaptations Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films based on musicals Category:Films based on The Phantom of the Opera Category:Films directed by Joel Schumacher Category:Films with screenplays by Joel Schumacher Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in the 1870s Category:Films set in 1870 Category:Films set in 1871 Category:Films set in 1919 Category:American historical romance films Category:British nonlinear narrative films Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:American films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber Category:2004 drama films ",
