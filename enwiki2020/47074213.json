The flag of South Mongolia,\"Holy Blue Sky\"|300px The Inner Mongolian independence movement, also known as the Southern Mongolian independence movement, is a movement for the independence of Inner Mongolia (also known as Southern Mongolia) and the political separation of Inner Mongolia from the People's Republic of China. It is principally led by the Mongolian diaspora in countries like Japan and the United States, and in some European countries. The movement is led primarily by three popular organizations: the Inner Mongolian People's Party, led by Temtsiltu Shobtsood (Xi Haiming); the Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance, led by Hada; and the Mongolian Liberal Union Party, led by Olhunud Daichin. The stated goals of all three organizations are the secession of Inner Mongolia from the People's Republic of China, and either the establishment of an independent Inner Mongolian state or the unification of Inner Mongolia with \"Northern Mongolia\" (a.k.a. the Mongolian state). ==See also== *Pan-Mongolism *List of active separatist movements in Asia *Secession in China *Separatist movements of China *Affirmative action in China *Human rights of ethnic minorities in China ==References== Category:History of Mongolia Category:Irredentism Category:Mongolian nationalism Category:Nationalist movements in Asia ",
