    "text": "\"So Young\" is a song by the Irish folk rock band The Corrs from their album Talk on Corners. ==Release== It is written by Sharon Corr and is a song about her parents, Jean and Gerry Corr, who she believed were \"forever young\".http://community.livejournal.com/thecorrsonline/27732.html The single is a remix by British electronic music group K-Klass. It reached number 29 on the Republic of Ireland pop music charts and number 6 in the United Kingdom. The band initially had to fight with their label to include the song on the album, a decision vindicated by its popularity. The K-Klass remix contains an extra section for the first verse, which was deleted from the album version for unexplained reasons (on the demo version, both the first and second verses were constructed as a single long verse, with the extra verse serving as the second shorter verse). Since May 1998, the band have performed the song with the extra verse included. ==Critical reception== The song received positive reviews. Larry Flick from Billboard wrote about the song, \"This K-Klass remix of \"So Young\" has been funked up just enough to better parallel U.S. programming trends and is as bright and inviting as anything we're hearing in power rotation these days. The Corrs are completely in control of the variables at hand, with a beautiful, uptempo melody line, crisp harmonies, right-on production, and, yes, a chorus that might just stick in the hearts of listeners given the chance to at last get to know this phenomenal Irish family quartet. Let's do it!\" ==Track listing== *CD # \"So Young\" (K-Klass remix) - 4:12 # \"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\" - 4:15 # \"Haste to the Wedding\" (acoustic; live in Brussels, July 1998) - 3:00 *Live at Royal Albert Hall EP (recorded 17 March 1998) # \"So Young\" (live) - 4:27 # \"When He's Not Around\" (live) - 5:13 # \"Joy of Life\" (live) - 4:44 # \"So Young\" (enhanced live video) - 4:30 ==Music video== This video was shot in Chicago as the Corrs were on tour in the US at that time (21 October 1998). Much shooting took place in and around the Flamingo Building. The structure that gives the building its name is 53 floors high and was designed by Alexander Calder in 1974. The Corrs are standing on the top of the Flamingo Building throwing paper planes into the windy air. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |Australia (ARIA Charts) |align=\"center\"|61 |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|36 |- |France (SNEP)French Charts |align=\"center\"|76 |- |Germany (Media Control Charts) |align=\"center\"|80 |- |Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |align=\"center\"|33 |- |Ireland (IRMA)Irish Charts |align=\"center\"|29 |- |Netherlands (Tipparade) |align=\"center\"|11 |- |Netherlands (Mega Single Top 100)Dutch Charts |align=\"center\"|63 |- |Scotland (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |Spain (Los 40 Principales) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company)Everyhit |align=\"center\"|6 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 singles Category:The Corrs songs Category:143 Records singles Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Lava Records singles Category:1997 songs ",
