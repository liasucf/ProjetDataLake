    "text": "The Court of Appeal (, lit. National Court) is an appellate court with appellate jurisdiction over all district court cases. The court was established by the Courts Act of 2016 and began operating 1 January 2018. The establishment introduced a three-tier judiciary in Iceland where before operated only district courts and the Supreme Court since the 1919 abolition of the National High Court. The court is composed of fifteen justices selected by the Qualifications Committee and nominated by the Minister of Justice for presidential confirmation. In cases where the minister wishes to make changes to the committee's selection, Parliament must approve of said changes with a simple majority vote. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Courts in Iceland Category:Organizations established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in Iceland ",
