    "text": "In computing cooperative distributed problem solving is a network of semi- autonomous processing nodes working together to solve a problem, typically in a multi-agent system. That is concerned with the investigation of problem subdivision, sub-problem distribution, results synthesis, optimisation of problem solver coherence and co-ordination. It is closely related to distributed constraint programming and distributed constraint optimization; see the links below. ==Aspects of CDPS== * Neither global control or global data storage \u2013 no individual CDPS problem solver (agent) has sufficient information to solve the entire problem. * Control and data are distributed * Communication is slower than computation, therefore: ** Loose coupling between problem solvers ** Efficient protocols (not too much communication overhead) ** problems should be modular, coarse grained * Any unique node is a potential bottleneck ** Organised behaviour is hard to guarantee since no one node has the complete picture ==See also== * Multiscale decision making * Distributed constraint optimization * Distributed artificial intelligence * Multi-agent planning ==Some relevant books== * A chapter in an edited book. * * See Chapters 1 and 2; downloadable free online. * Category:Applications of distributed computing Category:Problem solving ",
