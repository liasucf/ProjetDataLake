    "text": "Heda \u010cechov\u00e1 (17 July 1928 \u2013 23 April 2020) was a Czech television anchorwoman, radio presenter, and politician. She later served as a member of the Czech National Council for the Civic Forum from 1990 until 1992 following the Velvet Revolution and Czechoslovakia's transition to democracy. ==Biography== \u010cechov\u00e1 was born Heda \u0160imandlov\u00e1 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on 17 July 1928. She began working as a radio announcer at Czechoslovak Radio, where her father worked, while still a student studying chemistry after World War II. She transitioned to an on-screen television anchor and presenter beginning in 1954. She became one of Czechoslovakia's most popular television anchors during the 1960s. Her television career ended in 1968 with the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring. \u010cechov\u00e1 and her colleagues were forbidden from reporting on the ongoing invasion. In response, Heda \u010cechov\u00e1 wore a black dress during her television show to protest both the invasion and its censorship by state-owned television. \u010cechov\u00e1 was dismissed from her on-air television anchor position and demoted to a job as a records keeper in the station archives. In 1977, she retired from the television station with a disability pension due to a cancer diagnosis. She was given just three months to live at the time of her diagnosis. However, she underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation, which successfully cured the cancer. She considered emigrating, but remained in the country due to her son. \u010cechov\u00e1 briefly entered politics following the Velvet Revolution and fall of communism in Czechoslovakia. She was elected to the Czech National Council, the legislative body of the Czech Republic during its federation with Czechoslovakia, as a member of the Civic Forum from 1990 to 1992. She noted that she didn't enter politics for money (the salary was just 12 thousand Czechoslovak koruna per month), but because \"we certainly didn't do it, the feeling of freedom was important to us.\" She left politics after leaving office in 1992. \u010cechov\u00e1 was married twice, including her first marriage to actor Vladim\u00edr \u010cech Sr., which ended in divorce. Her only child, actor and television host Vladim\u00edr \u010cech, died from Lynch syndrome in 2013. Heda \u010cechov\u00e1 died on 23 April 2020, at the age of 91. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Czech television presenters Category:Czech radio personalities Category:Members of the Czech National Council Category:Civic Forum politicians Category:20th-century Czech women politicians Category:Czech women in politics Category:Czechoslovak women in politics Category:People from Prague ",
