In 1860, the Ndyuka signed a peace treaty with the Aluku, and allowed them to settle in Abunasunga. The Aluku had chosen French citizenship, and therefore Abunasunga is a French village. Abunasunga was founded by Wayana chief Kanailu, who left the village of Kawemhakan after a conflict with granman Anapaik\u00eb about the influence of the Baptist mission on Wayana life in Kawemhakan. Abunasunga is unique among Wayana villages in that it lies in the territory inhabited by Aluku. == Notes == == References == * * Category:Villages in French Guiana ",
