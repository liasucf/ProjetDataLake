Rulers sung by Kalladar include Ambarkilan Aruvandhai, Mullur king Kari, Ori, Akdhai, Pandiyan Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, Venkatamalai ruler Kalvar Koman Pulli, Poraiyatru Kilan Periyan, Nannan, and Kalangaai Kanni Narmudicheral. Other poets who also sung about the Pandiyan King Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, including Kudapulaviyanar, Mangudi Kilar, and Mangudi Marudhanar, were thus his contemporaries. With his friendship with Mamulanar, he formed part of the Kallada\u2013Mamulanar dyad. ==Contribution to the Sangam literature== Kalladar has written verses in Kurunthogai (verses 260 and 269), Agananuru (verses 9, 63, 113, 171, 199, 209, 333), and Purananuru (verses 23, 25, 371, 385, 391). The chief themes that Kalladar handled in his verses include battlefield, consequences of battles, and the plights of widows of the slain soldiers. He has also composed verse 9 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai. He is believed to have written a commentary on the Tolkappiyam. A later work of Kallaadam, unlike one would guess, was not authored by Kalladar. ===Views on Valluvar and the Kural=== Kalladar opines about Valluvar and the Kural text thus: ==See also== * Sangam literature * List of Sangam poets * Tiruvalluva Maalai ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Tamil philosophy Category:Tamil poets Category:Sangam poets Category:Tiruvalluva Maalai contributors ",
