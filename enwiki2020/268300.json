    "text": "Punk-O-Rama was the title given to a series of ten compilation albums published by Epitaph Records between 1994 and 2005. The first volume was released in 1994, the second in 1996, and the rest annually from 1998 to 2005. The albums included artists from Epitaph's roster as well as from its subsidiary label ANTI- and its partnership labels Hellcat Records and Burning Heart Records. In total the series included 257 songs contributed by 88 different artists. Rancid and Pennywise are the only bands to appear on all 10 volumes. Scott Radinsky appears on all 10, 1 with Ten Foot Pole and 9 with Pulley. As its title implied, the series featured mostly punk rock and various punk subgenres such as garage punk, hardcore punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, ska punk, skate punk, and street punk. However, as the series went on and the labels' rosters diversified, the music of the Punk-O-Rama compilations grew to include additional styles of music such as alternative hip hop, alternative rock, digital hardcore, emo, experimental music, garage rock, indie rock, metalcore, psychobilly, and screamo. Artwork for the series was inconsistent over the first four installments, with cover art and layout provided by varying artists and designers. C. Martin provided artwork and layout for both the fifth and sixth volumes, though they had differing styles and themes. Nick Pritchard of Metrosea.com provided artwork and layout for the final four volumes of the series, which adopted a similar look and style. Epitaph also organized several Punk-O-Rama tours featuring bands that had contributed to the compilations, such as Agnostic Front, All, The Distillers, Guttermouth, Millencolin, Straight Faced, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Occasionally these would be accompanied by special Punk-O-Rama tour sampler CDs that differed from the main. series of compilation albums. In 2003 the label published the DVD Punk-O-Rama: The Videos, Volume 1, including 22 music videos and \"The Epitaph Story\", a short film relating the history of the label. Though a second volume was never published, the subsequent ninth and tenth albums in the compilation series included DVDs of music videos as well. In 2006 Epitaph announced the retirement of the Punk-O-Rama brand in favor of a new series titled Unsound, the less genre-specific title being more conducive to the label's expanding roster of musical styles. However, only one compilation was published under the Unsound banner before that series was also discontinued. ==Releases== ===CDs=== ====Punk-O-Rama (1994)==== Punk-O-Rama is a compilation album released by Epitaph Records on November 18, 1994. Featuring twelve bands from the label's roster, the album was the first installment in the Punk-O- Rama series which continued until 2005. ====Punk-O-Rama Vol. 2 (1996) ==== Punk-O-Rama Vol. 2 is the second compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. This was the first entry to be released at a low price, so that it was more appealing for someone to buy to check out Epitaph's artists. All of the songs were previously released with the exception of DFL's \"Thought Control\". Me First and the Gimme Gimmes' cover of Billy Joel's \"Only the Good Die Young\" made its CD debut here, as it was previously only available on Billy, a vinyl single released by the band. ;Vans Warped Tour '97 Presents Punk-O-Rama 2.1 A tour edition of this volume was released in conjunction with the 1997 Vans Warped Tour. The artwork and track listing are slightly modified. The track listing is as follows: ====Punk-O-Rama III (1998) ==== Punk-O-Rama III is the third compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. This entry features two previously unreleased tracks, \"We Threw Gasoline on the Fire and Now We Have Stumps for Arms and No Eyebrows\" by NOFX and \"Wake Up\" by Pennywise. NOFX's track was later released on their rarities compilation 45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records. The European version has Undeclinable Ambuscade's track \"7 Years\" and takes off \"Lozin' Must\" by Millencolin. ;Europe version # \"We Threw Gasoline on the Fire and Now All We Have Stumps for Arms and No Eyebrows\" \u2013 NOFX # \"Everybodies Girl\" \u2013 Dwarves # \"World's on Heroin\" \u2013 All # \"Say Anything\" \u2013 Bouncing Souls # \"Delinquent Song\" \u2013 Voodoo Glow Skulls # \"Everready\" \u2013 H2O # \"Greed Motivates\" \u2013 Straight Faced # \"Telepath Boy\" \u2013 ZEKE # \"Never Connected\" \u2013 Union 13 # \"Gotta Go\" \u2013 Agnostic Front # \"Defiled\" \u2013 New Bomb Turks # \"Haulass Hyena\" \u2013 The Cramps # \"Rats in the Hallway\" \u2013 Rancid # \"Steel-Toed Sneakers\" \u2013 Humpers # \"Bad Seed\" \u2013 Wayne Kramer # \"Rotten Egg\" \u2013 Gas Huffer # \"Poison Steak\" \u2013 Red Aunts # \"No Equalizer\" \u2013 Down By Law # \"Alright\" \u2013 Osker # \"A.D.D.\" \u2013 Ten Foot Pole # \"7 Years\" - Undeclinable Ambuscade # \"You\" \u2013 Bad Religion # \"Nailed To The Floor\" \u2013 I Against I # \"3 Times 75\" \u2013 Looking Up # \"Time's Up\" \u2013 Burning Heads # \"If\" \u2013 Pulley # \"Wake Up\" \u2013 Pennywise ====Punk-O-Rama 4: Straight Outa The Pit (1999)==== Punk-O-Rama 4 is the fourth compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. This is the only entry to have a sub-title. All of the tracks were previously released except the first track, \"Fight It\" by Pennywise. This was the first entry to include bands from the Swedish Burning Heart Records label, which has its material distributed by Epitaph Records in North America. It also includes a song from the Tom Waits album Mule Variations, which was released on Epitaph's indie rock label ANTI-. ;Europe version # \"Fight It\" \u2013 Pennywise \u2013 2:15 # \"Second Best\" \u2013 Pulley \u2013 1:49 # \"Faster Than the World\" \u2013 H2O \u2013 2:17 # \"1998\" \u2013 Rancid \u2013 2:46 # \"Watch Me Play\" \u2013 Heideroosjes \u2013 2:26 # \"Hopeless Romantic\" \u2013 The Bouncing Souls \u2013 2:07 # \"The Getaway\" \u2013 Ten Foot Pole \u2013 3:41 # \"Think the World\" \u2013 ALL \u2013 1:21 # \"Snap Decision (At Rope's End)\" \u2013 New Bomb Turks \u2013 2:23 # \"Generator\" \u2013 Bad Religion \u2013 3:19 # \"I Will Deny\" \u2013 Dwarves \u2013 1:39 # \"Let's Do This\" \u2013 Straight Faced \u2013 1:23 # \"It's My Life\" \u2013 Agnostic Front \u2013 2:29 # \"Panic\" \u2013 Beatsteaks \u2013 2:40 # \"Theme From Eeviac\" \u2013 Man Or Astro-Man? \u2013 2:32 # \"They Always Come Back\" \u2013 Voodoo Glow Skulls \u2013 3:23 # \"Twisted\" \u2013 Zeke \u2013 1:56 # \"Don't Panic\" \u2013 Gas Huffer \u2013 1:46 # \"Big in Japan\" \u2013 Tom Waits \u2013 4:04 # \"Someone to Love?\" \u2013 Gentleman Jack Grisham \u2013 2:52 # \"A Life's Story\" \u2013 Union 13 \u2013 2:09 # \"Picture This\" \u2013 98 Mute \u2013 2:05 # \"Lucky\" \u2013 Osker \u2013 2:14 # \"The Best Place In The World To Leave\" \u2013 I Against I \u2013 1:04 # \"Kids of the K-Hole\" \u2013 NOFX \u2013 4:49 ====Punk-O-Rama #5 (2000) ==== Punk-O-Rama 5 is the fifth compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. All of the tracks were previously released except for \"Pump Up the Valium\" by NOFX and \"Problematic\" by All. The latter two tracks were title tracks left off the band's current albums at the time, NOFX's Pump Up the Valuum and ALL's Problematic. Also, NOFX's track was later released on the rarities compilation album 45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records. \"Secure Horizons\" by Guttermouth was later rerecorded on their Covered With Ants record. \"Good Rats\" by Dropkick Murphys was later rerecorded on their Sing Loud Sing Proud record. The Rancid song \"Poison\" was a demo version of the song off their Rancid 5 record. This is the only entry in the series not to include a song by Bad Religion. ;Europe version ====Punk-O-Rama 2001, Vol. 6 (2001) ==== Punk-O-Rama 2001, Vol. 6 is the sixth compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. The cover is a reference to a scene in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, as this was the release from the year 2001. The US release of Punk-O-Rama Vol. 6 included a total of five previously unreleased tracks. The unreleased tracks are \"Blackeye\" by Millencolin (US only), \"We're Desperate\" by Pennywise, \"Original Me\" by Descendents, \"Let Me In\" by Beatsteaks and \"Bath of Least Resistance\" by NOFX. Pennywise perform \"We're Desperate\" with Exene Cervenka, who is from X which is the band that originally performed the song. \"Original Me\" was originally performed by ALL, which is the band the members of the Descendents formed when Milo Aukerman went to college. \"Bath of Least Resistance\" by NOFX was later released on their rarities compilation 45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records. \"Blackeye\" by Millencolin was later released in their album Home from Home, and was the only previously unreleased track to not appear on the UK release of Punk-O-Rama Vol. 6. ====Punk-O-Rama 7 (2002) ==== Punk-O-Rama 7 is the seventh compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. # \"Fingers Crossed\" \u2013 Millencolin \u2013 2:47 # \"Wayfarer\" \u2013 Hot Water Music \u2013 2:58 # \"Up for Sale\" \u2013 The (International) Noise Conspiracy \u2013 3:26 # \"The World\" \u2013 Pennywise \u2013 2:26 # \"Black City\" \u2013 Division of Laura Lee \u2013 3:36 # \"Olympia, WA\" \u2013 NOFX \u2013 2:59 # \"Addicts of Communication\" \u2013 Randy \u2013 2:00 # \"Hooray for Me\" \u2013 Pulley \u2013 2:19 # \"The Something Special\" \u2013 The Bouncing Souls \u2013 3:23 # \"God Knows\" \u2013 Beatsteaks \u2013 2:34 # \"The Defense\" \u2013 Bad Religion \u2013 3:54 # \"The End\" \u2013 Deviates \u2013 2:02 # \"Heroes from Our Past\" \u2013 Dropkick Murphys \u2013 3:30 # \"Bob\" \u2013 Rancid \u2013 2:02 # \"Wasted Words\" \u2013 Death by Stereo \u2013 3:33 # \"Love to Be Hated\" \u2013 Agnostic Front \u2013 2:13 # \"Outside Looking In\" \u2013 1208 \u2013 2:46 # \"M.A.D.\" \u2013 98 Mute \u2013 3:16 # \"My Girlfriend\" \u2013 Guttermouth \u2013 2:35 ;Europe version # \"Fingers Crossed\" \u2013 Millencolin \u2013 2:47 # \"Wayfarer\" \u2013 Hot Water Music \u2013 2:58 # \"Up for Sale\" \u2013 The (International) Noise Conspiracy \u2013 3:26 # \"The World\" \u2013 Pennywise \u2013 2:26 # \"Black City\" \u2013 Division of Laura Lee \u2013 3:36 # \"Olympia, WA\" \u2013 NOFX \u2013 2:59 # \"Addicts of Communication\" \u2013 Randy \u2013 2:00 # \"Hooray for Me\" \u2013 Pulley \u2013 2:19 # \"The Something Special\" \u2013 The Bouncing Souls \u2013 3:23 # \"God Knows\" \u2013 Beatsteaks \u2013 2:34 # \"The Defense\" \u2013 Bad Religion \u2013 3:54 # \"The End\" \u2013 Deviates \u2013 2:02 # \"Heroes from Our Past\" \u2013 Dropkick Murphys \u2013 3:30 # \"Bob\" \u2013 Rancid \u2013 2:02 # \"Wasted Words\" \u2013 Death by Stereo \u2013 3:33 # \"Love to Be Hated\" \u2013 Agnostic Front \u2013 2:13 # \"Outside Looking In\" \u2013 1208 \u2013 2:46 # \"M.A.D.\" \u2013 98 Mute \u2013 3:16 # \"My Girlfriend\" \u2013 Guttermouth \u2013 2:35 # \"What's Left Of The Flag\" \u2013 Flogging Molly \u2013 3:39 # \"We're All Fucked Up\" \u2013 Heideroosjes \u2013 3:17 ====Punk-O-Rama 8 (2003) ==== Punk-O-Rama 8 is the eighth compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series.

This is the first of two entries to be released as a two-disc with a DVD. The DVD features current music videos by bands on the CD, with the exception of Randy and Converge who do not appear on the CD. Additionally, of the bands that appear on both the CD and the DVD, only The Bouncing Souls and Matchbook Romance have the same song on each, with \"Sing Along Forever\" and \"Promise\" respectively. All of the tracks on the CD were previously released except \"Seein' Diamonds\" by Hot Water Music and \"The Plague (live)\" by Death By Stereo. This is the only entry in the series not to include a song by NOFX. This was one of the main albums where the now popular band Motion City Soundtrack first found their fame with the humorous video shown on the DVD. ;CD # \"Social Suicide\" \u2013 Bad Religion \u2013 1:35 # \"Ride the Wings of Pestilence\" \u2013 From First to Last \u2013 4:20 # \"Sick Little Suicide\" \u2013 The Matches \u2013 4:17 # \"The Keys to Life vs. 15 Minutes of Fame\" \u2013 Atmosphere \u2013 2:40 # \"Now I Know\" \u2013 Pennywise \u2013 2:57 # \"Throw Down\" \u2013 Motion City Soundtrack \u2013 3:12 # \"Tropical London\" \u2013 Rancid \u2013 3:03 # \"The Dirty Glass\" \u2013 Dropkick Murphys \u2013 3:37 # \"Plea from a Cat Named Virtute\" \u2013 The Weakerthans \u2013 3:49 # \"Promise\" \u2013 Matchbook Romance \u2013 4:16 # \"City in the Sea\" \u2013 Scatter the Ashes \u2013 4:22 # \"Liberation Frequency\" \u2013 Refused \u2013 4:11 # \"Struck By a Wrecking Ball\" \u2013 Nekromantix \u2013 3:28 # \"Bad Reputation\" \u2013 Pulley \u2013 2:53 # \"Fall Apart\" \u2013 1208 \u2013 3:08 # \"Sing Along Forever\" \u2013 The Bouncing Souls \u2013 1:35 # \"Seein' Diamonds\" \u2013 Hot Water Music \u2013 3:36 # \"Life Goes By\" \u2013 The Special Goodness \u2013 2:45 # \"Miss Take (Radio Edit)\" \u2013 HorrorPops \u2013 3:06 # \"Temptation\" \u2013 Tiger Army \u2013 2:10 # \"Dirty Love\" \u2013 Division Of Laura Lee \u2013 3:11 # \"Burn in Hell\" \u2013 Error \u2013 3:04 # \"Now\" \u2013 Eyedea & Abilities \u2013 4:21 # \"The Plague (live)\" \u2013 Death By Stereo \u2013 2:58 ;DVD # \"Sing Along Forever\" \u2013 The Bouncing Souls # \"Miss Take\" \u2013 HorrorPops # \"Trying to Find a Balance\" \u2013 Atmosphere # \"Insects Destroy\" \u2013 Pulley # \"The Next Big Thing\" \u2013 1208 # \"Promise\" \u2013 Matchbook Romance # \"The Future Freaks Me Out\" \u2013 Motion City Soundtrack # \"Psalm for the Future for the Elks Lodge Last Call\" \u2013 The Weakerthans # \"X-Ray Eyes\" \u2013 Randy # \"NFA\" \u2013 The Special Goodness # \"Heartless\" \u2013 Converge # \"Hand In Hand\" - Beatsteaks ====Punk-O-Rama 10 (2005) ==== Punk-O-Rama 10 is the tenth and final compilation album in the Punk-O-Rama series. The following year saw the start of Epitaph Records' new compilation series called Unsound. This is one of only two, along with the previous entry, to be released as a two-disc with a DVD. The DVD features current music videos by bands on the CD, with the exception of C. Aarme, The Weakerthans, The Black Keys, Atmosphere, Horrorpops and Eyedea & Abilities who do not appear on the CD. Additionally, of the bands that appear on both the CD and the DVD, only The Bouncing Souls and Roger Miret and the Disasters have the same song on each, with \"Anchors Aweigh\" and \"Riot, Riot, Riot\" respectively. Although most of the tracks on the CD were previously released, this entry features more unreleased tracks than any other in the series. \"Shoot Me in the Smile\" by The Matches, \"News From The Front\" by Bad Religion (however, the song was a bonus track on certain regional releases of Stranger Than Fiction), \"Mixin' Up Adjectives\" by This Is Me Smiling, \"From the Tops of Trees\" by Scatter the Ashes, \"Mission from God\" by The Offspring, \"Bloodstain\" by Pulley and \"Not the Way\" by The Special Goodness\" were all previously unreleased as was the live version of \"Anchors Aweigh\" by The Bouncing Souls. Additionally, \"There's No Fun in Fundamentalism\" by NOFX made its CD debut here, as it was previously only available on one of the 7\" of the Month Club vinyl singles. ;CD # When \"You're\" Around \u2013 Motion City Soundtrack # Lovers & Liars \u2013 Matchbook Romance # Shoot Me in the Smile \u2013 The Matches # Failure By Designer Jeans \u2013 From First to Last # Sun Vs.

Epitaph chose to change the name of the compilation series because the name \"Punk-O-Rama\", especially in its later releases, no longer reflected the wide range of music released on the compilations. Unsound is similar to the last two entries in the Punk-O- Rama series in that it is a two-disc set with a CD and a DVD, which contains music videos of bands on the CD.
