    "text": "The Halliburton House is a historic house at 300 West Halliburton Street in De Witt, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and end chimneys. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entry sheltered by a portico supported by paired Doric columns. The house's significance lies in its construction and occupation in 1860 by William Henry Halliburton (1816-1912), who, as the deputy sheriff of Arkansas, oversaw the 1853 purchase of the land that became De Witt, when the county seat was relocated following the separation of Desha County. Halliburton served as a county official in a variety of capacities until the American Civil War. After twenty years in private legal practice he served three terms in the state legislature. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Arkansas County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1855 Category:Houses in Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas County, Arkansas ",
