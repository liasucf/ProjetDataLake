Puletta, Corroni Fali, Razzoli Caputo, and R. Calizone) finished erecting a massive, pink, stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out, on the side of the mountain. The final piece was 200 feet (about 60 metres) in length and 20 feet (6 metres) high on its sides. The group did not only expect people to observe the art work, but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top. The work, titled Hase (German for \"hare\"), often called Pink Rabbit, first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025, though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016.https://goo.gl/maps/L5Ay3oSHmSK2 ==References== ==External links== *Official Gelitin page on the rabbit Category:Sculptures in Italy Category:Outdoor sculptures in Italy Category:Hills of Piedmont Category:2005 sculptures Category:Fabric sculptures ",
