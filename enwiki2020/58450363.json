Pierluisi, by which Puerto Rico highest court derogated a clause added by Puerto Rico Law # 7 of 2005 (Law No. 7-2005) to the Constitution of Puerto Rico, annulled Pedro Pierluisi's government, and reinforced the 1952 Constitutional provisions for succession of government. == Early life and education == V\u00e1zquez was born in Santurce, San Juan and raised in Guaynabo.

V\u00e1zquez was initially expected to become governor of Puerto Rico after the resignation of Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 on August 2, 2019. She was met with opposition, with critics calling for her resignation due to allegations of corruption and inability to deal with domestic violence on the island. Protests against her proposed succession as governor took place, the most notable of these being the Somos M\u00e1s march, Spanish for \"We Are More\", a title alluding to a popular chant during the protests calling for Rossell\u00f3's resignation. The hashtag #WandaRenuncia (Spanish for \"Wanda Resign\") began trending on Twitter soon after Rossell\u00f3 announced his intention to resign. V\u00e1zquez said on Twitter that she had no interest in becoming governor, and that she would take the position only if she were constitutionally required to. On July 31, Rossell\u00f3 announced that he was appointing Pedro Pierluisi as the new Secretary of State; the secretary of state supersedes the secretary of justice in the order of succession. On August 1, however, the Puerto Rican Senate blocked Pierluisi from being confirmed as secretary of state in time for Rossell\u00f3's resignation on August 2.

However, he was not confirmed by the Senate, calling into question the validity of his governorship.

She responded by accusing the judge in charge of the investigation of being a supporter of her primary elections challenger Pedro Pierluisi. V\u00e1zquez was ordered by the panel to present evidence in the form of photos which she claimed demonstrated that political motives were behind the investigation, but she failed to provide said evidence.
