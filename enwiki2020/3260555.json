    "text": "David Smith (born in Bellville, Texas, USA) is a former reality-television participant who was a participant in the second season of the Fox network's Joe Millionaire. Smith went to Italy and wooed 14 European women, pretending to be an $80,000,000 oil tycoon. He actually earned about $11,000 a year as a ranch hand. In the end, Smith chose Linda Kasdova, a lady from the Czech Republic over Cat, a woman from Germany. Smith won a ranch in Texas, while Kasdova was given a check for $250,000. They broke up soon after. The series did not get high ratings, and no other Joe Millionaire shows were produced. ==References== *CNN.com \u2013 *New York Daily News \u2013 Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
