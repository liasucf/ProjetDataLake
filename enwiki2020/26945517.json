(Jan. 1920), pp. 28-55. Ahmose called Turo was a son of Ahmose Si-tayit. Ahmose Turo's son Ahmose Patjenna would continue to serve the royal family during the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. Turo (Thuwre) served under Ahmose as Commander of Buhen. Later he served as King's Son (of the Southern Region) under Amenhotep I (inscriptions in Semneh, Uronarti). He served under Thutmose I according to inscriptions dating to year 1 and 3. Turo is mentioned in an inscription at West-Silsileh belonging to the vizier User. This inscription dates to the reign of Hatshepsut. This may be a posthumous mention of the Viceroy. It's possible there were family connections between Ture and User; Turo is shown leading Vizier Aa'methu's daughters in procession. (Aa'methu was User's father).George A.
