    "text": "Roman Bridge railway station () is a request stop passenger station in the Lledr Valley, Wales, on the Conwy Valley Line from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, which is operated by Transport for Wales. It is sited north of Blaenau Ffestiniog and is the last station in the Lledr valley before the long Ffestiniog tunnel is reached. ==History== The station was opened on 22 July 1879 when the London and North Western Railway opened an extension of the Conwy Valley line from to . The station was host to two LMS caravans from 1935 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1954 to 1956. The station building still stands and is well maintained as a residence - it was offered for sale in 2013 for \u00a3450,000 as a private home (with 10 acres of land), after previous use as a holiday cottage.\"Yours for \u00a3450,000 - one of Wales' most remote railway stations\" Cresci, Elena Wales Online article 27 April 2013; Retrieved 31 May 2017 ==Location== There is no village, and the station, which is useful to walkers and takes its name from a nearby ancient bridge over the River Lledr, is on a minor road from the A470 road leading to scattered hill farms at Blaenau Dolwyddelan. ==Facilities== It is unstaffed, but has had digital CIS screens fitted like the other halts on the line. It also has a standard waiting shelter, pay phone (number 01690 750483) and timetable poster board for train running information provision.Roman Bridge station facilities National Rail Enquiries The station nameboards incorrectly display the Welsh station name as Pont Rufenig instead of Pont Rufeinig.Roman Bridge station nameboard (2009) Buck, Jeff Geograph.org.uk; Retrieved 31 May 2017 Early Baedeker guide books to Great Britain state that there is no explanation for the name, though the Roman road Sarn Helen is known to have passed down the valley on its way from Canovium (in the Conwy Valley) to Tomen y Mur, at Trawsfynydd, and a crossing at this point would seem feasible. ==Services== Five southbound and six northbound trains call on request Mondays to Saturdays (approximately every three hours), with three trains each way on Sundays between May and early September. Services were temporarily suspended in February 2020 and replaced by road transport due to flooding of the line north of Llanrwst caused by Storm Ciara. Following completion of the work to repair the storm damage, services at the station were reinstated on 28 September 2020. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Conwy Valley Railway Category:Dolwyddelan Category:Railway stations in Conwy County Borough Category:Railway request stops in Great Britain Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1879 Category:Railway stations served by Transport for Wales Rail ",
