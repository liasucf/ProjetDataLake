    "text": "The Voice of Midnight is a concept album by The Residents, released in 2007. It was adapted from a short story, \"Der Sandmann,\" by Prussian writer E. T. A. Hoffmann. The protagonist of the story is Nathaniel (Nate) who carries a deep- seated fear that the childhood fable character, The Sandman, is stalking him. Nate's fianc\u00e9e, Clair is a steadfast realist. The first 500 copies of the CD came with a five track bonus CD-EP The Sandman Waits. The original plan was for it to be the first 300, but so many people pre-ordered the recording that they boosted the print run. ==Scenes== ==Actors== Nate: Corey Rosen *First worked with The Residents on River of Crime Clair: Gerri Lawler *Worked on River of Crime as well as Tweedles.
