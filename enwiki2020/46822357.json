    "text": "Tema Development Coroporation is a public entity tasked with the planning and development of the entire city of Tema, Ghana. In conjunction with the State Housing Corporation it \"develops and provides affordable housing to the public\". The corporation has been instrumental in developing the harbour area of Tema in particular, with modern housing. ==History== The Corporation was set up in 1952 with the sole aim to develop and manage the township of Tema. In 1963, the Tema Development Corporation Act was passed. In recent years the corporation has had much investment from Korea, including plans, as of 2013, to build a new stadium, an idea which proved unpopular with squatters. The first chief executive officer of the Corporation was Theodore S. Clerk, the first Ghanaian architect and award-winning urban planner who served in the CEO position from 1963 after the enactment of the statute, until 1965. ==References== Category:Tema Category:Government agencies of Ghana Category:Government agencies established in 1952 Category:Economy of Ghana ",
