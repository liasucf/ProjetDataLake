In April 2014 she was named on the Hay Festival's Africa39 list of 39 Sub-Saharan African writers aged under 40 with the potential and talent to define trends in African literature.Africa39 list of artists, Hay Festival. Her short story \"The Sack\" won the 2015 Caine Prize for African fiction in English. In 2020, Serpell was the winner in the Belles-lettres category Grand Prix of Literary Associations 2019, for her debut novel The Old Drift.\"GPLA 7TH Edition: Winners Announced\", Bamenda Online, 29 July 2020. ==Biography== ===Early years and education=== Namwali Serpell was born in 1980 in Lusaka, Zambia, to Robert Serpell and his wife. Her British-Zambian father is a professor of psychology at the University of Zambia, and her mother is an economist. When she was nine, her family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States, where Serpell was educated. She completed her undergraduate degree in literature at Yale and her doctorate (PhD) in American and British fiction at Harvard. ===Career=== Since 2008 she has lived in California, where she is an associate professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley. She returns to Lusaka for visits annually. Her short story \"Muzungu\" was shortlisted in 2010 for the Caine Prize, an annual award for African short fiction in English. In 2011, she received the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award, a prize for beginning women writers. Her story \"The Sack\" won the Caine Prize in 2015. Serpell, saying \"fiction is not a competitive sport\", announced she would share the $15,000 prize with the other shortlisted writers, Masande Ntshanga, F. T. Kola, Elnathan John, and Segun Afolabi. Serpell was the first Caine winner from Zambia. The \"sack\" of the title, according to Serpell, derives from a terrifying dream she had at 17, \"and I didn't know if I was on the inside or the outside\". It also has political implications: \"I was studying American and British fiction, and [another graduate student] was studying African contemporary fiction, and her theory was that any time you saw a sack in African literature, it was a hidden reference to the transatlantic slave trade. I was kind of writing my story against that.\" In 2014 she published Seven Modes of Uncertainty, a critical work that examines \"the relationship between literature's capacity to unsettle, perplex, and bewilder us, and literature's ethical value\".\"Namwali Serpell launches '7 Modes of Uncertainty'\", Africa39, 18 May 2014. The book was described in the journal Novel: A Forum on Fiction as \"a bravura performance\".Martin, Theodore (1 August 2016), \"No Uncertain Terms\", Novel 49 (2): 393\u2013397. doi: https://doi.org/10.1215/00295132-3509213.

Serpell's debut novel, The Old Drift, was published in 2019. Reviewing it in The Guardian, Nadifa Mohamed wrote: \"Namwali Serpell\u2019s first novel is a rambunctious epic that traces the intertwined histories of three families over three generations. ...Serpell is an ambitious and talented writer, with the chutzpah to work on a huge canvas.\"Mohamed, Nadifa (14 March 2019), \"The Old Drift by Namwali Serpell review \u2013 genre-blending Zambian debut\", The Guardian. The Observer review concluded: \"By the end, set in a near future involving a new digital device embedded in the user\u2019s skin, we realise how slyly Serpell is testing our assumptions, before a cunning last-minute swerve forces us to question why we don\u2019t consider science fiction a viable mode for the great African novel.\"Cummins, Anthony (10 March 2019), \"The Old Drift by Namwali Serpell \u2013 review: Sci-fi meets forbidden love in a debut novel spanning centuries and continents\", The Observer. In March 2020 she was one of eight writers to be awarded a Windham\u2013Campbell Literature Prize, one of the world's richest literary prizes, awarded annually, with each winner receiving $165,000.Ibeh, Chukwuebuka (20 March 2020), \"Zambian-American Novelist Namwali Serpell Wins $165,000 as a Recipient of the 2020 Windham-Campbell Prize\", Brittle Paper.

On 23 September 2020, it was announced that The Old Drift had also won her the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the UK's top prize for science fiction. Serpell responded on Twitter on 25 September by saying that she had received news of the award \"within an hour of hearing that the cops who killed Breonna Taylor weren't charged. To honor Breonna and the ongoing fight against state-sanctioned violence, I'm donating the \u00a32020 prize money to bail funds for protestors. Join me...\", explaining the reason for her show of solidarity in a BBC interview: \"I've been trying to figure out how to acknowledge both the honor that this award grants to my novel and the feeling that the political revolution I'm describing in the novel is yet to come\u2026My novel is not exactly prophetic. It is just resonant with the questions and issues that have been with me as part of the culture that has formed me. And that culture, I want to say, is one where science fiction is a force that lets us probe real urgent political questions about equality and power and justice.\" == Bibliography == ;Non-fiction * The Ethics of Uncertainty: Reading Twentieth-century American Literature, PhD dissertation, Harvard University, 2008, * Seven Modes of Uncertainty, Harvard University Press, 2014, * strange facesunderlivered lectures series,2020,978-1-945492-43-3(paperback), 978-1945492-47-1(ebook). ;Novels * The Old Drift, Hogarth Press, 2019, ;Short stories *\"Account\", in Enkare Review *\"Double Men\", in Reader, I Married Him, HarperCollins Publishers, 2016, * * Ellah Wakatama Allfrey (ed.) ==Awards== * 2011: Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award * 2015: Caine Prize for African Writing, for \"The Sack\" * 2019: Brittle Paper Award for Essays & Think Pieces, for \"On Black Difficulty: Toni Morrison and the Thrill of Imperiousness\" * 2020: Grand Prix of Literary Associations 2019, Belles-Lettres Category.Read on this link * 2020: Windham\u2013Campbell Literature Prize * 2020: Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, for The Old Drift * 2020: Arthur C.
