The reserve is just from the municipal seat, and includes the Bacurizal Forest and Lake Caraparu on the shore of the Bay of Maraj\u00f3. The lake has dark waters, and empties into Maraj\u00f3 Bay. It was created to protect the coastal environment, to preserve natural resources, support scientific research, environmental education and ecotourism, while allowing the traditional fishing communities to make sustainable use of the resources. The ecological reserve is managed by technicians and environmentalists of the municipal prefecture of Salvaterra. The municipality is contained in the Maraj\u00f3 Archipelago Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation unit established in 1989 to protect the environment of the delta region. ==Environment== The forest has a well-preserved environment that includes many examples of local flora and fauna, including the bacurizeiro tree, after which it is named. This tree is of considerable economic value for its fruit and its fine wood used in furniture making. The forest has many trails giving access to the mangroves, the Tapera Campina fishing port and the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o beach. The interior of the forest, with its many tall trees, is dark, cool and damp. The local people extract seeds, roots and sap for medicinal purposes. There are diverse fauna including various types of primate, many birds, and fish and crabs in the mangrove waters. The reserve is important as an area for feeding and reproduction of many migratory birds, including the endangered scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber). ==Notes== ==Sources== * * Category:Ecological reserves of Brazil Category:Protected areas of Par\u00e1 ",
