    "text": "Louis the Bavarian The imperial election of October 20, 1314 was an imperial election held to select the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It took place in Frankfurt. Like the previous day election, the meeting was called to decide the successor of Emperor Henry VII, died while in Italy on 24 August 1313. Henry's son John, King of Bohemia since 1310, was considered by many prince- electors to be too young, and by others to be already too powerful. While one day before three electors of seven appointed Frederick the Fair, son of the late German king Albert I, the results was reputed invalid, due to the absence of the others electors and the presence as fourth elector of Henry of Carinthia, the deposed King-Elector of Bohemia who still claimed the title against John. The election was presided by Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz and member of the pro-Luxembourg party. Like the past election, of seven electors only four attended the meeting: * Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop-Elector of Mainz * Baldwin of Luxembourg, brother of Henry VII and Archbishop-Elector of Mainz * John, son of Henry VII and King-Elector of Bohemia * Waldemar of Stendal, Elector of Brandenburg * John II of Lauenburg, claimant Elector of Saxony against Rudolf I of Wittenberg As a result of the election, Louis IV, Duke of Bavaria was elected Holy Roman Emperor. However, due to the unrecognized claim of John II of Lauenburg, the election was considered invalid by the electors who supported Frederick the Fair. The two contested elections caused the eruption of a civil war inside the Holy Roman Empire, fought between pro-Luxembourg and pro-Habsburg parties. Louis was successfully crowned at Aachen - the customary site of coronations - by Archbishop of Mainz, while the Archbishop of Cologne, who by custom had the right to crown the new king, crowned Frederick at Bonn. In the following conflict between the kings, Louis recognized in 1316 the independence of Switzerland from the Habsburg dynasty. After several years of bloody war, victory finally seemed within the grasp of Frederick, who was strongly supported by his brother Leopold. However, Frederick's army was decisively defeated in the Battle of M\u00fchldorf on 28 September 1322 on the Ampfing Heath, where Frederick and 1300 nobles from Austria and Salzburg were captured. Louis was finally crowned Emperor in Rome on 17 January 1328 by Senator Giacomo Colonna, demoting Pope's authority and introducing the tradition imperial legitimacy only by election, not papal coronation. ==References== 1314 Category:1314 in Europe ",
