The school is named after the German chemist Joseph K\u00f6nig. On March 24, 2015, 16 of its students and two of its teachers were among the passengers murdered when the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 intentionally crashed into the French Alps. They were on their way home from a student exchange with the Giola Institute in Llinars del Vall\u00e8s, Catalonia. Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, has described it as \"the darkest day in the history of our city\". ==References== ==External links== * Joseph-K\u00f6nig- Gymnasium Category:Educational institutions established in 1844 Category:Schools in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Gymnasiums in Germany ",
