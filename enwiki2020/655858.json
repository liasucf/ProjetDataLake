    "text": "Ahmad () is a common male Arabic name. Other spellings of the name include Ahmed and Ahmet. == Etymology == The word derives from the root (\u1e25-m-d), from the Arabic (), from the verb (\u1e25amida, \"to thank or to praise\"), non-past participle (). == Lexicology == As an Arabic name, it has its origins in a Quranic prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quran about Muhammad. It also shares the same roots as Mahmud, Muhammad and Hamid. In its transliteration the name has one of the highest number of spelling variations in the world.Humanism, Culture, and Language in the Near East: Asma Afsaruddin, A. H. Mathias Zahniser \u2013 1997 p 389 Some Islamic traditions view the name Ahmad as another given name of Muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by Muslims to be the more esoteric name of Muhammad and central to understanding his nature.\"Muhammad: Prophet of Islam\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 28 September 2009. Retrieved 28 September 2009. Over the centuries, some Islamic scholars have suggested the name's parallel is in the word 'Paraclete' from the Biblical text,Al-Mas\u0101q: studia arabo-islamica mediterranea: Volumes 9 \u00e0 10; Volume 9 University of Leeds. Dept. of Modern Arabic Studies, Taylor & Francis \u2013 1997 \"Many Muslim writers, including Ibn Hazm, al-Taban, al-Qurtubi, and Ibn Taymiyya, have identified the Paraclete with Muhammad. Probably the first to do so was his biographer Ibn Ishaq in the mid eighth century.\"\"Isa\", Encyclopedia of IslamWatt (1991) pp. 33\u201334 although this view is not universal considering translations, meanings and etymology.Glasse, p. 151.A. Guthrie and E. F. F. Bishop, p. 253\u2013254. Traditional Islamic sources, such as Sahih al- Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and others contain hadith in which Muhammad personally refers to himself as Ahmad. Islamic scholars such as William Montgomery Watt, however, argue that the use of Ahmad as a proper name for Muhammad did not exist until well into the second Islamic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense. He concludes that the development of the term being used as a name in reference to Muhammad came later in the context of Christian-Muslim polemics, particularly with Muslim attempts to equate Muhammad with the Biblical 'Paraclete', owing to a prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quranic verse 61:6.W. Montgomery Watt (1953) \u2018HIS NAME IS AHMAD\u2019 The Muslim World, 43 (2):110\u2013117 According to the New Encyclopedia of Islam, and the older Encyclopaedia of Islam, the word Ahmad has no etymological attachment to the word Muhammad, but instead has been defined and understood according to its form and likeness to the word Muhammad. == Interpretations and meanings of Ahmad == === Development === Regarding Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammad, the Sirat Asul Allah, Islamic scholar Alfred Guillaume wrote: === Ahmad passage === Here are three translations of the passage in question in Surat 61 verse 6: The verse in the Quran attributes a name or designation, describing or identifying who would follow Jesus. In his Farewell Discourse to his disciples, Jesus promised that he would \"send the Holy Spirit\" to them after his departure, in John 15:26 stating: \"whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth... shall bear witness of me.\" John 14:17 states \"[even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.\"John by Andreas J. K\u00f6stenberger 2004 , page 442.The Gospel of John: Question by Question by Judith Schubert 2009 , pages 112\u2013127. Regarding verse 61: 6 in the Quran: Contrary to the above claim that Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham did not mention Ahmad and the respective passage, there is Ibn Ishaq's work with the title Kitab al-Maghazi and Ibn Hisham who mention and connect the words Mohammad & Ahmad with the Paraclete. Additionally it has been documented that there was an attempt to connect the respective quranic verse with the Paraclete even earlier then Ibn Ishaq. Moreover, a later interpolation of this passage to the Quran, just to serve as an ex eventu prove for the early muslim scholars, has also been refuted in modern Islamic Studies. This is been supported by the fact that the earliest as well as the later manuscripts of the Quran contain the exact passage and wording in Surah 61. === Scholarship regarding the Greek translation === \"Early translators knew nothing about the surmised reading of periklutos for parakletos, and its possible rendering as Ahmad \u2026. Periklutos does not come into the picture as far as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham are concerned. The deception is not theirs. The opportunity to introduce Ahmad was not accepted \u2013 though it is highly improbable that they were aware of it being a possible rendering of Periklutos. It would have clinched the argument to have followed the Johannine references with a Quranic quotation.\" \"Furthermore the Peshitta, Old Syriac, and Philoxenian versions all write the name of John in the form Yuhanan, not in the Greek form Yuhannis.. Accordingly to find a text of the Gospels from which Ibn Ishaq could have drawn his quotation we must look for a version which differs from all others in displaying these characteristics. Such a text is the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary of the Gospels which will conclusively prove that the Arabic writer had a Syriac text before him which he, or his informant, skillfully manipulated to provide the reading we have in the Sira.\".A. Guillaume. The Version of the Gospels Used in Medina Circa 700 A.D. Al-Andalus, 15 (1950) pp. 289\u2013296.Guillaume`s note: Evangeliarum Hierosolymitanum ed. Count F.M. Erizzo, Verona, 1861, p. 347, and The Palestinian Syriac Lectionary of the Gospels re-edited from two Sinai MSS and from P. de Lagarde`s edition of the Evangeliarum Hierosolymitanum by Agnes Smith Lewis and Magaret Dunlop Gibson, London, 1899, p. 187. \"Muslim children are never called Ahmad before the year 123AH. But there are many instances prior to this date of boys called 'Muhammad.' Very rarely is the name 'Ahmad' met with in pre-Islamic time of ignorance (Jahiliya), though the name Muhammad was in common use. Later traditions that the prophet's name was Ahmad show that this had not always been obvious, though commentators assume it after about 22 (AH).\"W. M. Watt who researched the name \"Ahmad\", as quoted by G. Parrinder, Jesus in the Koran, Sheldon Press, pp. 98\u201399. \"It has been concluded that the word Ahmad in Quran as-Saff 61:6 is to be taken not as a proper name but as an adjective... and that it was understood as a proper name only after Muhammad had been identified with the Paraclete.\"J. Schacht, Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol I, 1960, p. 267. \"Note that by the middle of the 2nd century AH, Muslims already identified Muhammad with the Greek word \"Paracletos\" (Counsellor / Advocate) or the Aramaic translation \"Menahhemana.\"New Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol I, 1960. === Historical document regarding the topic === Text of the correspondence between `Umar II and Leo III: \"We recognize Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as the authors of the Gospel, and yet I know that this truth, recognized by us Christians wounds you, so that you seek to find accomplices for your lie. In brief, you admit that we say that it was written by God, and brought down from the heavens, as you pretend for your Furqan, although we know that it was `Umar, Abu Turab and Salman the Persian, who composed that, even though the rumor has got round among you that God sent it down from heavens\u2026. [God] has chosen the way of sending [the human race] Prophets, and it is for this reason that the Lord, having finished all those things that He had decided on beforehand, and having fore-announced His incarnation by way of His prophets, yet knowing that men still had need of assistance from God, promised to send the Holy Spirit, under the name of Paraclete, (Consoler), to console them in the distress and sorrow they felt at the departure of their Lord and Master. I reiterate, that it was for this cause alone that Jesus called the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, since He sought to console His disciples for His departure, and recall to them all that He had said, all that He had done before their eyes, all that they were called to propagate throughout the world by their witness. Paraclete thus signifies \"consoler\", while Muhammad means \"to give thanks\", or \"to give grace\", a meaning which has no connection whatever with the word Paraclete.\"Arthur Jeffery. Ghevond`s Text of the Correspondence Between `Umar II and Leo III. Harvard Theological Review. XXXVII (1944), 269\u2013332. Pp. 292\u2013293. == Transliterations == Ahmad is the most elementary transliteration. It is used commonly all over the Muslim world, although primarily in the Middle East. More recently, this transliteration has become increasingly popular in the United States due to use by members of the African American community. Ahmed is the most common variant transliteration, used especially in the context of the Ottoman Empire. This transliteration is also used throughout the Muslim world. Ahmet is the modern Turkish transliteration. Modern Turkish uses a Latin-based alphabet, and most Arabic-derived names have standardized Turkish spellings. The less common transliterations of Ahmad are used by Muslims outside the Middle East proper, such as in Indonesia and Russia. Achmat is the fairly standard transliteration used by South Africa's Muslim community, and its pronunciation shows evidence of the influence of Afrikaans: the which represents \u062d [\u0127] is pronounced as an Afrikaans [x] (i.e. closer to the Arabic \u062e); and the \u062f [d] is realised as a [t] (closer to the Arabic \u062a) which follows Afrikaans Final-obstruent devoicing principles. == List of people with the name == === Ahmad === * Ahmad Shah Durrani, Founder of Last Afghan Durrani Empire * Ahmad (rapper), West Coast hip hop performer * Ahmad (Jowzjan), a delegate to Afghanistan's Constitutional Loya Jirga * Ahmad (Takhar), a delegate to Afghanistan's Constitutional Loya Jirga * Ahmad Abbas, Saudi Arabian footballer * Ahmad Abdalla, Egyptian film director * Ahmad Adel, Egyptian footballer * Ahmad Ahmadi, Iranian physician * Ahmad Alaq, Khan of eastern Moghulistan * Ahmad A'zam, Uzbek writer * Ahmed Ibrahim Artan, Somali diplomat, author and politician * Ahmad Bahar, Iranian politician * Ahmad Belal, Egyptian former football player * Ahmad Black, American football safety for the Florida Gators * Ahmad Bradshaw, American football running back for the Indianapolis Colts, released via free agency from the New York Giants * Ahmad Brooks, American football linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers * Ahmad Bunnag of Siam * Ahmad Bustomi, Indonesian footballer * Ahmad Carroll, American football free agent * Ahmad Dahlan, Indonesian Islamic revivalist * Ahmad Dhani, Indonesian musician * Ahmad Dukhqan, Jordanian politician * Ahmad Fanakati, financial officer of Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty * Ahmad Fuadi, Indonesian writer * Ahmad Gooden (born 1995), American football player * Ahmad Hardi, Kurdish poet * Ahmad Hawkins, American football defensive back for the Alabama Vipers * Ahmad Hijazi (born 1994), Lebanese footballer * Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Founder of the Hanbalite school of Muslim jurisprudence * Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Abbasid ambassador to the Volga Bulgars * Ahmad ibn Tulun, founder of the Tulunid dynasty * Ahmad-Jabir Ahmadov, \"Honored teacher\" of Azerbaijan * Ahmad Jalloul (born 1992), Lebanese footballer * Ahmad Jamal, American jazz pianist * Ahmad Kasravi, Iranian linguists and historian * Ahmad Khatib, first Masjid al-Haram Imam of Indonesian origin * Ahmad Maher (disambiguation), various people * Ahmad Majid, Mughal faujdar of Sylhet * Ahmad Mohammad Hasher Al Maktoum * Ahmad Miller, former defensive tackle for the National Football League * Ahmad Mirfendereski (1918\u20132004), Iranian diplomat * Ahmad Merritt, American football free agent * Ahmad Nivins, American basketball player * Ahmad ibn Rustah, Persian chronicler born in Isfahan, Persia * Ahmad Rash\u0101d, sportscaster and former football player * Ricky Ahmad Subagja, Indonesian badminton player * Ahmad Saad, a Saudi Arabian football player. * Ahmad Said (politician), Malaysian politician * Ahmad Shah Massoud, Afghan military leader Deputy Justice on the Supreme Court of Afghanistan * Ahmad Shah Qajar, Last Shah of the Qajar dynasty * Ahmad Shamlou, Persian poet and writer * Ahmad Shukeiri, first Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization * Ahmad Sohrab, Persian author * Ahmad Syafi'i Maarif, Indonesian intellectual * Ahmad Tajuddin, 27th Sultan of Brunei * Ahmad Taktouk (born 1984), Lebanese footballer * Ahmad Tekuder (died 1284), leader of the Mongol Ilkhanate * Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of Sierra Leone * Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar * Ahmad Thomas (born 1994), American football player * Ahmad Treaudo, American football cornerback for the California Redwoods * Ahmad Yani, Indonesian Army general * Ahmad Zarruq, Shadhili Sufi Sheikh * Ahmad Yaakob, Malaysian politician;
