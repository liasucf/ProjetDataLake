The Jaguar remained a prototype and was not commercially produced. (Star and death of the Ulyanovsk \"Jaguar\" at http://www.zr.ru/archive/zr/1993/07/kolieso, Behind the Wheel, 1993) == History == Design of an amphibious vehicle was started by designers of the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant in 1976. A total of 14 were made in addition to the 1989 prototype. Cars have been successfully tested and adapted for weapons. During testing the vehicle travelled on the Volga from Ulyanovsk to Astrakhan and back.

It had a flotation body with two hermetically closed doors, underfloor, in front of the rear axle \u2013 equipped with two propellers. The amphibious car is driven due to the rotation of the front wheels that perform the function of rudders (This contributes proximity screws that hold out the water through an arch of the front wheels). == Variants == UAZ-39071 \u0411\u0410\u041a\u041b\u0410\u041d (Cormorant) from 1986 to 1989, under a separate contract with the USSR's Committee for State Security Border Troops, modifications were developed and with the installation of six pairs of skis, radar, radio, machine gun, and a cell for search dogs. ==See also== * VAZ Reka another Soviet era amphibious 4x4 ==References== ==External links== * UAZ Jaguar at UAZBuka.ru (Russian) Category:Wheeled amphibious vehicles Category:UAZ Category:Cars of Russia Category:Vehicles introduced in 1976 Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Military vehicles of Russia Category:Military light utility vehicles ",
