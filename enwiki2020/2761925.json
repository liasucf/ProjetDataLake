    "text": "Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, commonly known as W.T. Woodson High School or simply Woodson, is a high school located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the east end of the city of Fairfax, opposite the shopping center on Main Street. The school opened in 1962 and was once the largest school in the state. It is named for W. T. Woodson, who served as Fairfax County School Superintendent from 1929 to 1961. As of 2016, the student population was roughly 2,400. Woodson has the largest campus in Fairfax County in size of area, and also houses Woodson Adult High School, a separate education facility run by FCPS that allows adults to earn their GEDs and HS diplomas. Woodson has appeared multiple times on Newsweek magazine's lists of top or best high schools, including #23 (2003), #34 (2005), #90 (2006), and #74 (2008). Woodson has also appeared on the top high schools lists from U.S. News & World Report: #90 (2008), #116 (2013), #200 (2016), and #365 (2019). Following the retirement of Jeff Yost, Dan Meier, the former principal of Robinson Secondary School, took over as interim principal for most of the 2014\u201315 school year. The current principal as of October, 2017 is Dr. Carlyn Floyd. == Demographics == For the 2018\u201319 school year, Woodson High School's student body was 51.84% white non-Hispanic, 25.03% Asian, 12.62% Hispanic, 4.60% black, and 5.91% \"Other.\" ==Renovation== Front entrance of Woodson High School Woodson began the process of renovating all of its facilities in 2005 and adding several classrooms. The project was paid for in bonds that were established in 2003 by a voter referendum. The issue of whether to renovate had been debated for several years before the plan was approved. Woodson was one of the oldest schools in Fairfax County Public Schools, as the main facilities (plumbing, heating/cooling, floors, electrical) were still fundamentally the same as they were when the structure was built. The renovations nearly doubled the square footage of the school. The project was completed in 2009. The renovation consisted of complete renovation to all existing interior spaces, as well as adding to the performing arts and athletic wings, creating a new administration wing with a new front entrance, highlighted by a large tower and the addition of a new science classroom wing and two student drop off areas. ==Activities, groups, and programs== Woodson's mascot is a Cavalier and the sports teams play in the AAA Patriot District and the Northern Region. In 1976, the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League used the school's stadium as their home field. ===Publications=== The Cavalcade is the school newspaper. The Cavalier, Woodson's yearbook, is a AAA publication. ==Communities served by Woodson== Several unincorporated areas, such as Mantua,\" Olde Creek, Canterbury Woods, Truro, Rutherford, Long Branch, and Wakefield Forest are served by Woodson. ==Woodson in the news== *On April 1, 1973, a strong tornado struck Woodson High School and ripped off the roof.
