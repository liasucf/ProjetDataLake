    "text": "Pondok Pesantren Waria Al-Fatah was a Madrasa in Yogyakarta, Indonesia for waria people. Shinta Ratri founded it with two other waria in 2008, after several waria lives were claimed by the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Ratri believed that the pesantren was the first madrasa for transgender people anywhere in the world. The madrasa had roughly 40 students and provided housing for about 10 women. In the madrasa, waria could dress as men or women according to their preference during prayers. The madrasa also provided community education in the hopes of fostering better treatment for waria in Java. The pesantren was closed in 2016 after threats of violence from conservative groups. == References == Category:Madrasas in Indonesia Category:Transgender topics and religion Category:Yogyakarta Category:LGBT and Islam ",
