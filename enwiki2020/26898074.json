    "text": "Dead Men are Dangerous is a 1939 British crime film directed by Harold French and starring Robert Newton, Betty Lynne, John Warwick, and Peter Gawthorne. It was released in the U.S. as Dangerous Masquerade. Its plot concerns an unsuccessful writer who is wrongly accused of a murder. ==Plot== Penniless and debt ridden writer Aylmer Franklyn (Robert Newton) happens upon a dead man lying under the branch of a tree, apparently killed during a violent storm. Swapping clothes and identities with the corpse seems like a way out of his troubles, and Franklyn even attends his own inquest; but little does he know the man had a criminal history and he soon finds the police on his trail. ==Cast== * Robert Newton as Aylmer Franklyn * Betty Lynne as Nina * John Warwick as Goddard * Peter Gawthorne as Conray * Merle Tottenham as Gladys * John Turnbull as Inspector Roberts * Aubrey Mallalieu as Coroner * Kynaston Reeves as James T. Franklyn * Winifred Oughton as Mrs Blagden * Cyril Chamberlain as George Franklyn (uncredited) * Charles Mortimer as Policeman (uncredited) * John Salew as Tramp (uncredited) * Anita Sharp-Bolster as Spinster Resident (uncredited) ==Critical reception== In a contemporary review, The Leicester Daily Mercury found \"Fast moving action, a goodly sequence of thrills, and some splendid acting by Robert Newton, characterises Dead Men are Dangerous, a film with a clever plot and a strong taste of the mysterious\"; while more recently, Vintage 45 wrote, \"No great acting to speak of and no real depth to the story but it\u2019s fun to watch it all unfold. Don\u2019t expect anything exceptional and you\u2019ll probably like it.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1939 films Category:1939 crime films Category:British films Category:British crime films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Harold French Category:British black-and- white films ",
