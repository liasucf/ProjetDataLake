The name \"Abdi\" appears three times in forms of the Bible that are in use among Jews, Protestants, and Roman Catholics.

He may be included in the genealogy to represent Ithnan, a Judahite city mentioned in Joshua 15:23. === Ethni === See Ethni. ===Evi=== Evi was one of five Midianite kings killed during the time of Moses by an Israelite expedition led by Phinehas, son of Eleazar according to Numbers 31:8 and Joshua 13:21. === Ezbon === Ezbon is the name of two people mentioned in the Bible: * A son of Gad ().

In Genesis 36:11 and 1 Chronicles 1:36, Gatam is described the \"son\" of Eliphaz, the son of Esau (who is according to the Bible the forefather of the Edomites). In the passages which describe Gatam as a \"son\" of Eliphaz, he is listed alongside his \"brothers\": Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Kenaz according to Genesis; a similar but slightly larger list of brothers in Chronicles (Chronicles includes Amalek as a brother of Gatam). However, in Genesis 36:16, Gatam and Amalek (along with a previously unmentioned Korah) are described not as individual sons but as \"clans\" of Eliphaz. === Gazez === In the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, two individuals by the name of Gazez appear in 1 Chronicles 2:46. However, the Peshitta includes only one Gazez, and at least one biblical scholar has suggested that the second Gazez may have been included in the Masoretic Text by mistake. 1\\. Gazez was the son of Haran, grandson of Caleb, a descendant of Jacob. His paternal grandmother was Ephah, wife of Caleb. () 2\\. Gazez was a brother of Caleb, and uncle of 1. Gazez. () ===Geber=== Geber (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8, geber), son of Uri, was one of King Solomon's regional administrators; his territory was Gilead.

His own son Micaiah hears Jeremiah's secretary Baruch read Jeremiah's prophecies against the nation, and reports to a meeting of the court officials, including his father, nearby. This leads to the scroll being read before king Jehoiakim, who cuts it up and burns it despite the protestations of Gemariah and Elnathan ben Achbor.Jeremiah 36:25 * Gemariah son of Hilkiah, one of the envoys whom King Zedekiah sent to Babylonia (Jeremiah 29:3) Nothing else is known of him; he was hardly the brother of Jeremiah, whose father was also named Hilkiah. ===Genubath=== Genubath (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05e0\u05d1\u05ea genubat \"Stolen\" Hitchcock's Bible Dictionary of Names) is mentioned in I Kings 11:20 as the son born to Hadad the Edomite and the sister of Queen Tahpenes, Pharaoh's wife. ===Gera=== Hebrew: \u05d2\u05e8\u05d0 Ger'a * In Gera is the fourth of ten sons of Benjamin. * Gera is also the name of the father of Shimei (2 Samuel 19:16) * Gera is also the name of two of the sons of Bela (see above), making both nephews of the earlier Gera.

Tibni is referred to in 1 Kings 16:21 and 22 as \"son of Ginath,\" which taken literally, could be read as implying that a person named Ginath was Tibni's father. However, the Encyclopaedia Biblica suggests that the term \"Ginath\" is a place-name or clan-name, so that \"Tibni son of Ginath\" has the meaning \"Tibni of Ginath.\" ===Guni=== Guni was a son of Naphtali according to Genesis 46:24 and Numbers 26:48. He was one of the 70 souls to migrate to Egypt with Jacob. ===Gideon=== Gideon was the son of Joash the Abiezrite, according to Judges 6:11.

He was the father of Abidan, a tribal chief. He is mentioned five times in the Book of Numbers, with each reference stating his relation to Abidan (, , , , .) His name is variously understood as meaning \"one with a disabled hand,\" \"a youth,\" or \"one who cuts down trees.\" === Gilalai === Gilalai is the name of a priest who participated as a musician in a procession led by Ezra.Nehemiah 12:36 === Gishpa === Gishpa, (KJV Gispa) was one of two leaders of the Nethinim who lived in Ophel, according to Nehemiah 11:21. There are no other mentions of the name anywhere else in the Bible. ==H== ===Haahashtari=== Haahashtari or Ahashtari was one of the sons of Naarah, one of the two wives of Asshur (1 Chronicles 4:6). Because the name is used to refer to a family of Judahites who descend from Judah via Ashhur, Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed that the name \"Haahashtari\" arose from a confusion between Ha- Ashhuri (\"the Ashhurite\") with the obscure term ahashtranim which appears in Esther 8:10. ===Habaiah=== Habaiah (also called Hobaiah or Obdia) was the name given to a priestly family mentioned in Ezra 2:61: the b'ne habayah (literally \"sons/descendants of Habaiah\").This information comes from Ezra 2:59\u201362 Along with the families Hakkoz and Barzillai, the Habaiah family were priests whose names were not registered in the official genealogical records.Ezra 2:59\u201362 As a result, Ezra ruled that their rights to serve as priests would be restricted until such time as a high priest could decide, using the oracular Urim and Thummim, whether they had divine approval to serve as priests.Ezra 2:63 The name \"Habaiah\" means \"Yahweh hides\" or \"Yahweh protects,\" and appears in manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint in the forms Labeia, Obaia, Odogia, Ebeia, Ab(e)ia, Obbeia, and Obdia. ===Habazziniah=== Habazziniah or Habaziniah was either the head of a family of Rechabites (Jeremiah 35:3), or else a place name for the location that a Rechabite lived. According to Cheyne and Black, it may have been a scribal error where the name \"Kabzeel,\" a place in the territory of Judah, was originally intended.\" ===Hachmoni=== Hachmoni or Hakmoni is mentioned in passing in 1 Chronicles 27:32, which records that his son Yechiel, a scribe, tutored David's sons. ===Hadadezer=== According to I Kings 11:23, Hadadezer (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05d3\u05d3\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 hadad'ezer \"Hadad helps\"Easton's Bible Dictionary) was king of Zobah. ===Haddad=== Haddad the Edomite was an adversary of Solomon (I Kings 10:14). ===Hadlai=== Hadlai is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 28:12 as an Ephraimite, and the father of Amasa. In manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint, his name is given as Choab, Addi, or Adli. ===Hagab=== Hagab (also Agaba, Accaba) is identified as the ancestor of a family of Nethinim, or temple assistants, who returned from the Babylonian exile. They appear in a list with other returnees in Ezra 2:46, but are omitted in the corresponding place in Nehemiah 7:48. A Hellenized version of this name appears in a similar context in 1 Esdras 5:30. In the New Testament, a prophet who appears in Acts 11:28 and 21:10 is named Agabus, a variant on the name Hagab. Hagab is a different character from Hagabah, which appears in the preceding verse. ===Hagabah=== Hagabah (also Hagaba, Graba, or Aggaba) is identified as the ancestor of a family of Nethinim, or temple assistants, who returned from the Babylonian captivity. They appear in a list with other returnees in Ezra 2:45, Nehemiah 7:48, and 1 Esdras 5:29. ===Haggi=== Haggi was a son of Gad according to Genesis 46:16 and Numbers 26:15. He was one of the 70 persons to migrate to Egypt with Jacob. === Hajehudijah === See Jehudijah. ===Hakkatan=== Hakkatan (also Acatan, Akatan), meaning \"the small one,\" is listed as the father of Johanan, a leader of the descendants of Azgad in Ezra 8:12 and 1 Esdras 8:38. Other than these two verses, the name Hakkatan appears nowhere in the Bible. === Hakkoz === Hakkoz is the name of two or three biblical individuals: * Head of the seventh of twenty-four priestly divisions created by King David. () * Head of a family of priests after the Babylonian exile. Unable to prove their lineage, the family lost its priesthood status. (, ) * Father of Uriah and grandfather of Meremoth, who assisted Nehemiah in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. (, ) He is probably identical to the previous entry. ===Hallohesh=== Hallohesh or Halohesh is a name which is used twice in the Bible. In a list of workers building the wall of Nehemiah, a man named \"Shallum son of Hallohesh\" is mentioned as having a leadership role.Nehemiah 3:12 Also in the Book of Nehemiah, a person named Hallohesh is recorded as affixing his seal (an ancient form of signature) to Ezra's covenant between God and the people living around Jerusalem.Nehemiah 12:24, or verse 25 in some Bibles. Thomas Kelly Cheyne believed that the name Hallohesh was a miswritten version of the name Hash-shilhi, (Shilhi). ===Hammedatha=== Hammedatha was an Agagite and the father of Haman (see ). ===Hammoleketh=== Hammoleketh or Hammolecheth is the sister of Machir, the eponymous ancestor of the tribe or clan of Machir (biblical region) Machir, which is reckoned as a part of the tribe of Manasseh in 1 Chronicles 7. The name appears to mean \"she who reigns\" if it is not a scribal error for some other name, such as Beth-Milcah. ===Hammelech=== Hammelech, in the King James Version is the name of the father of Jerahmeel (Jeremiah 36:26), and it is the name of the father of Malkijah (Jeremiah 38:6). In a number of more recent translations, the Hebrew ha-melekh is taken as the common noun \"the king\" instead of the proper noun \"Hammelech.\"For example, NIV, ESV, NASB, HCSB, JPS (1917), and RV. ===Hamor=== Hamor was the father of Shechem. Shechem defiled Dinah, according to Genesis 34 ===Hamul=== Hamul was a son of Pharez of the Tribe of Judah according to Genesis 46:12 and Numbers 26:21. He was one of the 70 souls to migrate to Egypt with Jacob. ===Hanameel=== Hanameel or Hanamel (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e0\u05de\u05d0\u05dc, which means \"Grace From God\"),Hitchcock, Roswell D. \"Entry for 'Hanameel'\". \"An Interpreting Dictionary of Scripture Proper Names\", New York, N.Y., 1869 a cousin of Jeremiah from whom the latter bought a field at Anathoth in Jeremiah 32:5-16. ===Hananiah=== Hananiah (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4, which means \"My Grace is the Lord\") is the name of several biblical characters: * Hananiah son of Zerubbabel, the father of Jeshaiah, was a descendant of David. * Hananiah son of Azur, a prophet in the time of king Zedekiah. He prophesied a return from the exile in Babylon within two years and was denounced by Jeremiah as a false prophet as a result. He died within a year of the denunciation.Jeremiah chapter 28 *Hananiah, appointed by Nehemiah, jointly with Hanani, to be responsible for the security of Jerusalem after its walls had been rebuilt. Nehemiah described him as \"a faithful man [who] feared God more than many\". ===Hanniel=== Hanniel Prince of the tribe of Manasseh; one of those appointed by Moses to superintend the division of Canaan amongst the tribe (Num. 34:23). ===Hanoch=== Hanoch is the name of two biblical figures: # A son of Midian, the eponymous forefather of the Midianites.Genesis 25:4, 1 Chronicles 1:33 # A son of Reuben, the eponymous forefather of the Tribe of Reuben.Genesis 46:9, Exodus 6:14, Numbers 26:5, 1 Chronicles 5:3. According to Cheyne and Black, the presence of this clan name in the genealogies of Reuben and Midian may indicate that the clan Hanoch was considered a part of the Tribe of Reuben but had a Midianite origin. === Haran === Haran or Aran refers to three minor characters in the Hebrew Bible: # Haran ( \u2013 H\u0101r\u0101n), son of Terah, from Ur of the Chaldees. He fathered Lot, Milcah and Iscah. () # Haran ( \u2013 \u1e24\u0101r\u0101n), son of Caleb, a descendant of Jacob, and Ephah his mother. Father of 1.Gazez, and brother of 2.Gazez.

The name \"Hareph\" in this case may refer to a group of people otherwise referred to by the term Hariphite. === Harhaiah === Harhaiah, in the Masoretic Text of Nehemiah 3:8, is mentioned in passing, as being the father of Uzziel, a man responsible for the repair of part of the wall of Jerusalem. The awkward phrasing of the verse suggested to Stanley A. Cook (1899) that there had been some scribal mishandling of the verse, and that the verse originally did not contain the name \"Harhaiah.\" === Harhas === Harhas, according to 2 Kings 22:14 and 2 Chronicles 34:22, was an ancestor of Shallum, the husband of the prophetess Huldah. However, where the Book of Kings has \"Harhas,\" the Book of Chronicles reads \"Hasrah.\"2 Chronicles 34:22 === Harim === Harim (; \"destroyed\" or \"dedicated to God\") was the name of three biblical patriarchs: * Head of the third of twenty-four priestly divisions instituted by King David. () * Head of a non-priestly family, with 320 members, which returned with Zerubbabel. (, ) Eight members of this family were found to have married gentile women, whom they divorced. () Harim's son Malchijah was one of those who helped repair the walls of Jerusalem, including the Tower of the Furnaces. () His seal was on the renewed covenant with God made by the Babylonian returnees. () * Head of a priestly family, with 1017 members, which returned with Zerubbabel. (, ) Five members of this family were found to have married gentile women, whom they divorced. () His seal was also on the renewed covenant. () The head of his family at the time of the return was Adna. () === Harnepher === Harnepher appears only once in the Bible, in 1 Chronicles 7:36, in a passage which surveys the descendants of Asher. The name may be of Egyptian origin, meaning \"Horus is good.\" === Harum === Harum is recorded as the father of Aharhel in 1 Chronicles 4:8, which lists him as an ancestor of several clans in the Tribe of Judah. === Harumaph === Harumaph is listed as the father of Jedaiah, a man responsible for making repairs to a part of Nehemiah's wall. He is only mentioned once in the Bible, in Nehemiah 3:10. === Hasadiah === Hasadiah is listed as one of the sons of Zerubabel in 1 Chronicles 3:20, and is therefore a member of the royal lineage of the Judahite kings. === Hashabiah === Hashabiah is a biblical name which appears frequently for individuals mentioned both before and after the Babylonian captivity. Because the name often appears in lists without any detailed description, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether different verses that use the name are referring to the same Hashabiah or to distinct persons. The following list of nine individuals is the number listed in the Encyclopaedia Biblica, although the encyclopedia does not claim that precisely nine people of this name are mentioned: # A Levite of the Merarite group, mentioned 1 Chronicles 6:45 (verse 30 in some Bibles). # Hashabiah son of Bunni, a Merarite Levite listed as living in Jerusalem in 1 Chronicles 9:14 and Nehemiah 11:15. # A leader of a large group of people in the time of David.1 Chronicles 26:30 # A musician, one of the musicians appointed by David for the musical service of the Temple.1 Chronicles 25:3, 19 # Hashabiah son of Kemuel, identified as the leader of the Levites in the time of David.1 Chronicles 27:17 # A Levite leader in the time of Josiah.2 Chronicles 35:9 # A Levite identified as having signed the covenant between Ezra and God.Ezra 8:19 # A ruler listed as one of the people responsible for repairing the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah 3:17. # The ruler of the clan of Hilkiah, according to Nehemiah 12:21. === Hashabnah === Hashabnah is the name given for one of the men who signed the covenant between the people of Judah and God in Nehemiah 10:25 (verse 26 in some Bibles).

They are categorized by Ezra as being descendants of \"Solomon's servants\" (see Nethinim). In the Greek text of 1 Esdras 5:34, a closely related work, Hattil is referred to as Agia or Hagia. === Hazaiah === Hazaiah is a figure mentioned in passing in Nehemiah 11:5 as an ancestor Maaseiah, a notable leader of the Tribe of Judah in Yehud Medinata.Nehemiah 11:5 ===Hazo=== Hazo was the son of Nahor and Milcah (). ===Heber=== Heber or Ch\u00e9ver () is the grandson of the patriarch Asher mentioned at and in . Heber probably should not be confused with the Eber who was Abraham's ancestor. ===Helek=== Helek was a son of Gilead of the Tribe of Manasseh according to Numbers 26:30 and Joshua 17:2. === Heldai === Heldai is the name of two biblical figures. According to the Encyclopaedia Biblica, it should most likely be given alternate vowels as Holdai or Huldai. # Heldai son of Baanah the Netophathite is listed as one of David's Mighty Warriors, and also in a list of military leaders given in 1 Chronicles 27:15. He is called \"Heled\" in 1 Chronicles 11:30, and \"Heleb\" in 2 Samuel 23:29. # A Jew living in Babylonia, mentioned in Zechariah 6:10. He is called Helem in Zechariah 6:14. === Helkai === Helkai is a name used in Nehemiah 12:15, in a list of priestly clan leaders in the \"days of Joiakim.\"Nehemiah 12:12\u201321 The text refers to Helkai as leading a clan named Meraioth.

In a passage which describes the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, two \"sons of Henadad\", Bavai and Binnui, are named as taking responsibility for portions of the wall.Nehemiah 3:18 and 24. Binnui reappears later, where he is described as a Levite and as one of the signatories of the covenant between Ezra, God, and the people of Judah.Nehemiah 10:9 The \"sons of Henadad,\" though without any specific individuals named, are mentioned in also in Ezra 3:9, a \"difficult passage\". ===Hepher=== Hepher was a son of Manasseh according to Numbers 26:32 and Joshua 17:2.

(I Kings 16:34) === Hillel of Pirathon=== * The father of Abdon, in the Book of Judges (Judges 12:13\u201315). === Hiram === Hiram (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05dd \u1e24iram) of Tyre, son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali whose father was a craftsman in bronze, was given the metal work of King Soloman's temple. I Kings 7:13\u201314. According to The Interpreter's Bible, Hiram is a shortened form of \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05dd ('a\u1e25\u00eer\u0101m, \"brother of Ram [the lofty one].\")The Interpreter's Bible, Buttrick, 1954, Abingdon Press, Volume III, Snaith, p. 51 === Hobab === Hobab was Moses' father-in-law () and the son of Moses's father- in-law (), Jethro. The relevant part of Numbers 10:29 reads: \"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law\". Reuel (or Raguel) and Jethro were different persons from different narratives of the same events (the Bible isn't coherent). That of Judges 4:11 reads: \"Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses\". Moses invited Hobab to take part in the Exodus journey into the Promised Land, wanting to make use of his local knowledge, but Hobab preferred to return home to Midian (). Briefly, Hobab, Reuel/Raguel, and Jethro were all Moses' father-in-law. === Hod === Hod is a biblical name which appears only in 1 Chronicles 7:37.

Numbers 26:42 calls Dan's son Shuham, and his descendants the Shuhamites. The Talmud names him as the murderer of Esau.Sotah 13a === Huzzab === Huzzab is either a name or a word which appears in Nahum 2:7 (verse 8 in some Bibles).

The Ketiv, the version written but not read aloud, reads somewhat differently, in a manner that suggested to Thomas Kelly Cheyne that the opening words of the verse were not the name of the giant, but words that indicated that David and his soldiers stayed in (the city of) Nob. Whatever the case with the Ketiv, the Qere as it now stands asserts that Ishbi-benob was the name of a Philistine giant, who was killed by Abishai son of Zeruiah.2 Samuel 21:16\u201317 Gesenius interprets his name as meaning \"dweller upon the height\".Pulpit Commentary on 2 Samuel 21, accessed 19 August 2017 In Brenton's Septuagint Translation, his name is given as Jesbi, the progeny of Rapha.Brenton's Septuagint Translation, 2 Samuel 21:16 === Ishhod === Ishhod (King James Version Ishod) is a figure mentioned only once in the Hebrew Bible. 1 Chronicles 7:18 lists Ishod as a son of Hammoleketh in a genealogy of the Tribe of Manasseh. === Ishiah === See Jesiah. === Ishijah === See Jesiah. === Ishmaiah === Ishmaiah (KJV Ismaiah) is the name of two biblical figures. * Ishmaiah son of Obadiah was the leader of the Tribe of Zebulun in the time of David, according to 1 Chronicles 27:19.

F. \"The Archaeological Background of the Hebrew Prophets of the Eighth Century\". Journal of Bible and Religion, vol. 8, no. 3, 1940, p. 134. However, no Assyrian king by the name of \"Jareb\" is known to history, which has led to a variety of conjectures about what the phrase refers to. According to W. F. Albright, the \"definitive solution\" to the problem is that the text should read mlk rb or mlky rb, meaning \"the great king\", a Hebrew translation of the common Assyrian royal title sharru rabu. The proposed emendation to \"great king\" has been accepted in a number of biblical translations.For example, NIV, NLT, ESV, Holman, and NET === Jaresiah === See Jaareshiah. ===Jarha=== Jarha was an Egyptian slave of Sheshan who was married to Sheshan's daughter according to 1 Chronicles 2:34\u201335. === Jarah === See Jehoaddah. === Jasiel === See Jaasiel. === Jathniel === Jathniel is a minor biblical figure who appears only in 1 Chronicles 26:2, in a list of Korahite porters. === Jaziz === Jaziz the Hagrite, according to 1 Chronicles 27:31, was in charge of king David's flocks of sheep and goats. === Jeatherai === See Ethni. === Jecamiah === See Jekamiah. ===Jecholiah=== Jecholiah (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5, yekhalyahu) of Jerusalem was the wife of the King of Judah, Amaziah, and the mother of King Azariah.2 Kings 15:2 Depending on translation used, her name may also be spelled Jechiliah, Jecoliah, or Jekoliah.

His name depends on which variant reading (see Qere and Ketiv) of the Masoretic Text one follows: the Ketiv reads yhbh (\"Jehubbah\") the Qere reads whbh (\"and Hubbah\"). ===Jehudi=== Jehudi (Hebrew \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \"Judahite\") \"the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi\" (Jeremiah 36:14) was one of the delegates the princes sent to fetch Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, to read his scroll. === Jehudijah === Jehudijah (), mentioned in 1 Chronicles 4:18, is the name given to the wife of Mered, and is listed as the mother of his children. Some Rabbinic sources claim that Jehudijah, a feminine form of the Hebrew yehudi (), meaning \"Jew,\" is to be used as a noun rather than a given name, interpreting the passage as \"his wife, the Jewess\" rather than \"his wife, Jehudijah,\" and that it is referring to Pharaoh's daughter, Bithiah, who is mentioned in the same passage and is said to have converted to Judaism. As Bithiah was an Egyptian, it would have been worth noting that she was a Jewess, especially given the importance of matrilineality in Judaism. === Jehush === See Jeush. ===Jeiel=== Jeiel is the name of ten individuals in the Hebrew Bible. * Jeiel, according to 1 Chronicles 5:7, was a leader in the Tribe of Reuben. * Jeiel, referred to as the \"father of Gibeon\", was an ancestor of King Saul.() The King James Version calls him \"Jehiel.\" This figure's name is affected by variant readings preserved through the Qere and Ketiv system in the Masoretic Text: the Ketiv calls him \"Jeuel,\" while the Qere calls him \"Jeiel.\" * Jeiel son of Hotham the Aroerite is listed as one of David's warriors in 1 Chronicles 11:44.
