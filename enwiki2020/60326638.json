They are considered as sub-humans and are set to do the jobs considered foul and disregarded in a society, like, manual scavenging. They were not allowed get education, to enter the religious buildings, and they were not permitted to use the public spaces as Varnas. The documentary talks about Punjab, where the caste-dynamics is unlike the rest of India due to the establishment of Sikh religion in this state in the mid-1500s. The Sikh religion had no space for caste-discrimination in theory, the Gurus preached egalitarianism across all the classes and caste groups and sought for the upliftment of the classes and groups marginalised by Hinduism. This attracted the disregarded groups to Sikhism. ==References== Category:Indian documentaries Category:Punjabi- language films ",
