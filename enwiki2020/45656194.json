It was originally scheduled for 6 February to 7 March 2021 but was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. New Zealand qualified automatically as hosts. Originally, it was announced that three more teams would qualify from the ongoing 2017\u201320 ICC Women's Championship, but in 2018 this was changed to four teams plus the hosts. The top three teams from a ten- team qualifier will also play in this edition of the Women's World Cup. However, on 12 May 2020, the ICC confirmed that the qualifier tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that the qualifier tournament would take place in 2021. ==Qualification== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Team !
