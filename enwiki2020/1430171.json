    "text": "The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters is a Finnish academy for natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. It is known in Latin as Societas Scientiarum Fennica, in Swedish as Finska Vetenskaps-Societeten, and in Finnish as Suomen Tiedeseura. It is a bilingual (Swedish and Finnish) science academy and the oldest of the four science academies in Finland. The society was founded in 1838 and is based in Helsinki. It has a total of 120 full ordinary Finnish members, excluding members who have reached the age of 67 (a member who reaches the age of 67 retains the rights as a member but leaves his or her chair open for election of a new member), and about 120 foreign members. It is divided into four sections: I: mathematics and physics, II: biosciences, III: humanities, and IV: social sciences. The society publishes a yearbook, Sphinx, and the book series Commentationes Humanarum Litterarum, Commentationes Scientiarum Socialium, Bidrag till k\u00e4nnedom av Finlands natur och folk and The History of Learning and Science in Finland 1828-1918. It also awards a number of prizes and grants for scientific and scholarly work. In addition to the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters, there are three other academies in Finland: the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters and two academies of engineering sciences. The four Finnish academies have an umbrella organisation for cooperation, the Council of Finnish Academies. == References == ==External links== *Societas Scientiarum Fennica, official website *Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters, English presentation *Publications Category:Science and technology in Finland Finland Finland Category:Learned societies of Finland Category:1838 establishments in Finland Category:Scientific organizations established in 1838 Category:19th century in Helsinki ",
