Conti was part of the order of John the Good though became a mainstream Augustinian in 1256 after the Grand Union of the order. He was a close friend of both Saint Nicholas of Tolentino and Blessed Ugolino da Gualdo Cattaneo. The beatification was confirmed on 11 March 1891 under Pope Leo XIII in a decree of 'cultus' confirmation or otherwise known as a confirmation of longstanding veneration to the late friar. ==Life== Angelo Conti was born in the small town of Foligno - in the Umbria province - in 1226 to nobles. He became a professed member of the Order of Saint Augustine in 1246 and was ordained to the priesthood not long after this. Conti participated in the Grand Union for the Augustinians in 1256 and became a mainstream friar since he was part of the branch of John the Good. He founded a total of three Augustinian monasteries with the aid of others. Conti was also a close friend of both Nicholas of Tolentino and Ugolino da Gualdo Cattaneo the latter with whom he founded a convent with. Conti lived in Foligno from 1248 to 1258 then became part of the Montefalco branch he established from 1275 until 1293. He relocated to a convent in Gubbio from 1293 to 1297 until going back to Foligno where he spent the remainder of his life though spent a brief period of time in Bevagna in 1306. Conti died on 27 August 1312 in Foligno and his remains were enshrined in the church of Saint Augustine in that same town. ==Beatification== The beatification for the late friar received approval from Pope Leo XIII on 11 March 1891 after the pontiff confirmed that there existed a local 'cultus' to the late friar - this is known as an enduring air of veneration to the candidate. The liturgical feast for the friar is celebrated on an annual scale on the date of his death though the order he was part of celebrates it each 6 September. ==References== ==External links== *Saints SQPN Category:1226 births Category:1312 deaths Category:People from Foligno Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:13th-century venerated Christians Category:13th-century Italian people Category:13th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:14th-century venerated Christians Category:14th- century Italian people Category:14th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Beatifications by Pope Leo XIII Category:Augustinian friars Category:Augustinian monks Category:Italian beatified people Category:Venerated Catholics ",
