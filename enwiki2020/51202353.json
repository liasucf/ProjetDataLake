The world is looking for trustworthy effective leadership and not this undignified dog and pony show that's really made a mockery of our system.\" He claims that the song \"doesn't push an agenda; it simply expresses a very common sense of disillusionment people seem to be feeling at this point in time.\"http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/listen-to-new-alter-bridge-song- show-me-a-leader/ Regarding the song's musical composition, lead guitarist Mark Tremonti said that Kennedy originally came up with the song's intro, and a part he had been working on himself became the chorus. It is also Alter Bridge's first time using seven-string guitars on a record. The song, like the rest of the album, was produced by Michael Baskette, who has worked with Alter Bridge since its 2007 album Blackbird.http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/alter-bridge-to-release- new-studio-album-the-last-hero/article/471026 ==Personnel== ;Musicians * Myles Kennedy \u2014 lead and backing vocals, rhythm and lead guitar * Mark Tremonti \u2014 lead guitar * Brian Marshall \u2014 bass * Scott Phillips \u2014 drums ;Production * Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette \u2014 production * Ted Jensen \u2014 mastering == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2016) !Peak position |- |- |} ==References== Category:2016 singles Category:Alter Bridge songs Category:Songs written by Mark Tremonti Category:Songs written by Myles Kennedy Category:2016 songs Category:Songs written by Brian Marshall Category:Songs written by Scott Phillips (musician) Category:Song recordings produced by Michael Baskette Category:Napalm Records singles ",
