    "text": "The 1969 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8) during the 1969 NCAA University Division football season. In their second season under head coach Jim Sweeney, the Cougars compiled a 1\u20139 record (0\u20137 in Pac-8, last), and were outscored 339 to 143. The team's statistical leaders included Jack Wigmore with 876 passing yards, Richard Lee Smith with 485 rushing yards, and Fred Moore with 523 receiving yards. Washington State won their opener at Illinois by a point with a late field goal, then lost nine straight. They did not play Palouse neighbor Idaho in 1969; outside of war years without teams (1943, 1944), it was the first break in the series since 1900. The game was dropped this season (and in 1971) to allow the Cougars to schedule all seven conference opponents. Both WSU and Washington entered the Apple Cup in Seattle winless (0\u20136) in conference play; the Huskies won their only game of the season to avoid the Pac-8 cellar. It was the first game of the series played on artificial turf. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL Draft== Three Cougars were selected in the 1970 NFL Draft {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- |Jim Vest |DE |15 |374 |New Orleans Saints |- |Fred Moore |WR |15 |388 |Oakland Raiders |- |Richard Smith |RB |17 |422 |Cincinnati Bengals |} :Vest was a former player (1967) who was with the Seattle Rangers of the Continental Football League. * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Oregon at WSU \u2013 October 4, 1969 *Game program: Pacific at WSU \u2013 November 1. 1969 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Washington ",
