It was founded in 1988 and seeks \"to build and strengthen international legal efforts to ban the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons.\" Its membership consists of individual lawyers and lawyer's organisations. The current co-presidents of the organisation are Peter Becker and Takeya Sasaki. The German section of the organisation was co-founded by former German Minister of Justice Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin. IALANA had a central role in the process that sought an advisory ruling on the legality of nuclear arms from the International Court of Justice.Sarah J.
