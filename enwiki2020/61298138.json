    "text": "thumb The Swap test is a procedure in quantum computation that is used to check how much two quantum states differ. Consider two states: |\\phi\\rangle and |\\psi\\rangle. The state of the system at the beginning of the protocol is |0, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle. After the Hadamard gate, the state of the system is \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle + |1, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle). The controlled SWAP gate transforms the state into \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle + |1, \\psi, \\phi\\rangle). The second Hadamard gate results in \\frac{1}{2}(|0, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle + |1, \\phi, \\psi\\rangle + |0, \\psi, \\phi\\rangle - |1, \\psi, \\phi\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle(|\\phi, \\psi\\rangle + |\\psi, \\phi\\rangle) + \\frac{1}{2}|1\\rangle(|\\phi, \\psi\\rangle - |\\psi, \\phi\\rangle) The Measurement gate on the first qubit ensures that it's 0 with a probability of P(\\text{First qubit} = 0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\Big( \\langle \\phi | \\langle \\psi | + \\langle \\psi | \\langle \\phi | \\Big) \\frac{1}{2} \\Big( | \\phi \\rangle | \\psi \\rangle + | \\psi \\rangle | \\phi \\rangle \\Big) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} {|\\langle \\psi | \\phi\\rangle|}^2 when measured. If \\psi and \\phi are orthogonal ({|\\langle \\psi | \\phi\\rangle|}^2 = 0), then the probability that 0 is measured is \\frac{1}{2}. If the states are equal ({|\\langle \\psi | \\phi\\rangle|}^2 = 1), then the probability that 0 is measured is 1. == Pseudocode == Below is the pseudocode for implementing the Swap test: :Inputs Two quantum states |\\psi\\rangle and |\\phi\\rangle, stored in two separate qubit registers, each containing n qubits _(We denote the i-th qubit in the two registers, respectively, by \\psi_i and \\phi_i)_ An ancilla qubit, initialized as |0\\rangle _(We denote the ancilla qubit by a)_ Some P \\in \\mathbb{N}, representing the number of times the algorithm will be executed :Output Compute |\\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle |^2 # For j ranging from 1 to P: ## Apply a Hadamard gate to the ancilla qubit ## For i ranging from 1 to n (iterating over each pair of qubits in the two registers): ### Apply CSWAP(a, \\ \\psi_i, \\ \\phi_i) _( a is the control qubit, while \\psi_i and \\phi_i are the targets)_ ## Apply a Hadamard gate to the ancilla qubit ## Measure the ancilla qubit in the Z basis and record the result of the measurement _(we assume that measurements yield either 0 or 1, and we denote the outcome of the measurement by M_j)_ # Compute s = 1 - \\textstyle\\frac{2}{P} \\textstyle\\sum_{i = 1}^{P} M_i :Return s _(Note that s \\approx |\\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle |^2, with equality occurring as P \\rightarrow \\infty)_ ==References== Category:Quantum algorithms Category:Quantum information science Category:Quantum mechanics ",
