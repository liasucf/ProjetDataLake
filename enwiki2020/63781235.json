The Uluzzian Culture is a transitional archaeological culture between the Middle paleolithic and the Upper Paleolithic, found in Italy and Greece. It has been dated by Katerina Douka as lasting from 45,000\u201339,500 years before present (BP); sometimes the date range 45,000\u201337,000 is given, bringing the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption (37,330 BP) into the picture. Geographical extent: In Italy: Apulia (the Grotta del Cavallo and the Uluzzo cave), Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Tuscany, and Fumane (the northernmost point).Peresani, M., 2012. Fifty thousand years of flint knapping and tool shaping across the Mousterian and Uluzzian sequence of Fumane cave. Quaternary International 247, 125\u2013150 Outside of Italy, only in Argolis, Greece (the cave of Klissoura).\"Klissoura cave\" often appears in the literature, but the archaeologists themselves use the spelling \"Klisoura\" or the phrase \"Cave 1 in Klisoura Gorge (Western Peloponnese)\". Koumouzelis, M., Ginter, B., Koz1owski, J.K., Pawlikowski, M., Bar-Yosef, O., Albert, R.M., Litynska-Zajac, M., Stworzewicz, E., Wojtal, P., Lipecki, G., Tomek, T., Bochenski, Z.M., Pazdur, A., 2001. The early Upper Palaeolithic in Greece: the excavations in Klisoura cave. J. Archaeol. Sci. 28, 515\u2013539. ==Discovery== Entrance to the Grotta del Cavallo (photo: Thilo Parg, 2019). Excavations by 1963 Arturo Palma di Cesnola of the Grotta del Cavallo (\"Cave of the Horse\") in southern Italy uncovered the first remains later called \"Uluzzian\". The cave is on the Salento peninsula in Apulia, overlooking the Gulf of Taranto. The only human remains were two deciduous teeth (Cavallo B and Cavallo C) from the Uluzzian deposit of Grotta del Cavallo identified as human by (Benazzi et al., 2011). These teeth, dated to 43,000\u201345,000 BP, are the oldest currently-known remains of modern humans in Europe. ==Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition== Stratigraphy of deposits on the floor of the Fumane Cave (photo:Thilo Parg, 2014). The Uluzzian is one of several techno-complexes considered to be \"transitional assemblages\": Uluzzian, Ch\u00e2telperronian, Szeletian, and Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician. ==Culture== The Uluzzians made and used beads from shells of marine molluscs such as scaphopods, snails (Columbella rustica, Cyclope neritea), and other species. ==See also== * Bacho Kiro cave ==References== ==External links== Category:Industries (lithics) Category:Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe Category:Peopling of Europe Category:Archaeology of Italy Category:Archaeological cultures in Italy Category:Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens fossils ",
