    "text": "The thirty-fifth government of Israel (, Mem'shelet Yisra'el HaShloshim VeHamesh) is the current government of Israel, which was sworn in on 17 May 2020. It was originally expected to be established following the April 2019 election, but after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unable to form a government, the Knesset dissolved itself, thereby setting up a snap election that took place on 17 September 2019. Following the second election, no one was able to form a government again, and a third election had to take place on 2 March 2020. An agreement was finally reached on 20 April 2020 between Netanyahu and MK Benny Gantz on the formation of a national unity government. == Background == After the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, the Blue and White faction leader Benny Gantz conceded, paving the way for incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of Likud, to begin talks with other parties to form a governing coalition. === Recommendations (April 2019) === On 15\u201316 April 2019, President Reuven Rivlin met with representatives of the parties in the 21st Knesset. They recommended as follows and Rivlin officially chose Netanyahu to form the next government. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !colspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"|Party !class=\"unsortable\"|Party Leader !class=\"unsortable\"|Seats !Recommended !class=\"unsortable\"|Source |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Likud |Benjamin Netanyahu |align=right|35 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Blue & White |Benny Gantz |align=right|35 |Gantz | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Shas |Aryeh Deri |align=right|8 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||UTJ |Yaakov Litzman |align=right|8 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Hadash\u2013Ta'al |Ayman Odeh |align=right|6 |No-one | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Labor |Avi Gabbay |align=right|6 |Gantz | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Yisrael Beiteinu |Avigdor Lieberman |align=right|5 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Union of the Right-Wing Parties |Rafi Peretz |align=right|5 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Meretz |Tamar Zandberg |align=right|4 |Gantz | |- |style=\"background:;\"| ||Kulanu |Moshe Kahlon |align=right|4 |Netanyahu | |- |style=\"background:| ||Ra'am\u2013Balad |Mansour Abbas |align=right|4 |No-one | |} === New election === Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition by the deadline of 29 May. Instead of letting Benny Gantz attempt to form a coalition of his own, a vote by the majority of the Knesset elected to dissolve itself, and a snap election was held on 17 September 2019. That election was inconclusive, prompting warnings of a third election. This prospect was deemed unacceptable by the opposition and the general public, and the prime minister called on Gantz to form a national unity government, even offering to cede the top job sometime in the future. Gantz rejected this offer, noting Netanyahu's proposed unity government would include all of Netanyahu's right-wing allies, but none of Gantz's centre-left allies. Gantz also refused to sit with Likud as long as Netanyahu is its leader, due to the criminal cases against Netanyahu. Yisrael Beiteinu, under its leader Avigdor Lieberman, called for a secular unity government composed of itself, Likud, and Blue and White, and that would specifically exclude Netanyahu's right-wing and religious allies. As Lieberman's party holds the balance of power in the Knesset, analysts identified such a coalition as the most viable option. === Recommendations (September 2019) === President Rivlin met with representatives of Blue and White, Likud, the Joint List, Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu on 22 September to ask for recommendations on whom to select for prime minister. The next day, he met with members of United Torah Judaism, Yamina, Labor-Gesher and the Democratic Union. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !colspan=3 class=\"unsortable\"|Party !class=\"unsortable\"|Party Leader !class=\"unsortable\"|Seats !Recommended !class=\"unsortable\"|Source |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Blue & White |Benny Gantz |align=right|33 |Gantz | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Likud |Benjamin Netanyahu |align=right|32 |Netanyahu | |- |rowspan=5 style=\"background:;\"| || ||Joint List |Ayman Odeh |align=right|13 |divided | |- | style=\"background:\"| || Hadash || Ayman Odeh ||align=right|5 || Gantz || |- | style=\"background:\"| || Ta'al || Ahmad Tibi ||align=right|2 || Gantz || |- | style=\"background:\"| || United Arab List || Mansour Abbas ||align=right|3 || Gantz || |- | style=\"background:| || Balad || Mtanes Shehadeh ||align=right|3 || No-one || |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Shas |Aryeh Deri |align=right|9 |Netanyahu | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Yisrael Beiteinu |Avigdor Lieberman |align=right|8 |No-one | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||UTJ |Yaakov Litzman |align=right|7 |Netanyahu | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Yamina |Ayelet Shaked |align=right|7 |Netanyahu | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:#EE1C25;\"| ||Labor-Gesher |Amir Peretz |align=right|6 |Gantz | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| ||Democratic Union |Nitzan Horowitz |align=right|5 |Gantz | |} Rivlin officially chose Netanyahu to form the next government on 25 September, though he conditioned it on Netanyahu giving back the mandate if he failed to form a government, in order to avoid another dissolution of the Knesset. Netanyahu agreed to this stipulation, and called for a \"unity government\" between himself, his allied religious parties, and Gantz. Gantz refused, on the basis that he had promised during the election not to join a Netanyahu-led coalition, and furthermore that a coalition that included all of Netanyahu's allies would not truly be a unity government. Efforts to resolve the deadlock were unsuccessful, and on 21 October Netanyahu returned the mandate to Rivlin. On 23 October, Rivlin's office tasked Gantz with forming a government; this mandate was given back to Rivlin on 21 November. From that day, MKs had three weeks in which they could choose to nominate any of themselves to serve as PM. The selected MK would have had to secure the support of 61 MKs. However, no MK was able to form a government, and it was determined on 12 December that a third election would take place on 2 March 2020. === Recommendations (March\u2013April 2020) === President Rivlin met with all elected parties and received their recommendations for prime minister on 15 March. Rivlin gave Gantz the mandate to form a government on 16 March. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! colspan=\"3\" class=\"unsortable\" |Party ! class=\"unsortable\" |Party Leader ! class=\"unsortable\" |Seats !Recommended !Source |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Likud||Benjamin Netanyahu |align=right|36 |Netanyahu | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Blue & White||Benny Gantz |align=right|33 |Gantz | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Joint List||Ayman Odeh |align=right|15 |Gantz | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Shas||Aryeh Deri |align=right|9 |Netanyahu | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |UTJ||Yaakov Litzman |align=right|7 |Netanyahu | |- |rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EE1C25;\" | | |Labor\u2013Gesher\u2013Meretz||Amir Peretz |align=right|7 |divided | |- | style=\"background:;\" | |Labor||Amir Peretz |align=right|3 |Gantz | |- | style=\"background:;\" | |Meretz||Nitzan Horowitz |align=right|3 |Gantz | |- | style=\"background:;\" | |Gesher||Orly Levy |align=right|1 |No-one | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Yisrael Beiteinu||Avigdor Lieberman |align=right|7 |Gantz | |- |colspan=2 style=\"background:;\" | |Yamina||Naftali Bennett |align=right|6 |Netanyahu | |} Before the election, Gantz vowed to form a government that would not include Netanyahu. Initially an attempt was made to form a minority government with external support from the Joint List, however this initiative promtply collapsed as MKs Yoaz Hendel and Zvi Hauser announced they would vote against such a government, citing an electoral promise not to lean on the Joint List which includes \"terror supporters\" such as Balad. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, Gantz reversed his stance and announced he was willing to support an emergency coalition with Netanyahu. On 21 March, Netanyahu announced negotiations were completed for a national unity government with a rotating prime ministership where Netanyahu would serve first, and would later be replaced by Gantz, although Gantz denied this and claimed negotiations were still ongoing. On 26 March, one day after Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein resigned, Gantz instead agreed to become Speaker of the Knesset. The fact that right-wingers in Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition agreed to support Gantz's bid to become speaker put the future of the Blue and White alliance in jeopardy. The same day Gantz was elected as the new Speaker of the Knesset by a margin of 74\u201318. On 27 March 2020, it was revealed that a major obstacle to a possible long-term alliance between Gantz and Netanyahu emerged with regard to implementing U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan. Barak Ravid of Israel's Channel 13 news revealed that Gantz, despite previously claiming that he wanted to implement the peace plan, still wanted to hold peace talks with the Palestinians, which Trump and Netanyahu still opposed. Ravid stated that this would likely make the upcoming deal between Gantz and Netanyahu short-lived. As part of the proposed coalition deal between Netanyahu and Gantz, Gantz was to replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel after 18 months' government. Gantz's term as prime minister- designate was going to end on 14 April, though President Rivlin extended it until 15 April. === Coalition government === On 20 April 2020, Gantz and Netanyahu announced that agreement on a unity government had been reached. The deal would involve both parties sharing power, and Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns being prime minister. Under the terms of the agreement Netanyahu is to be prime minister until October 2021, with Gantz serving as vice prime minister. After that time the men are to exchange roles. However, should Netanyahu leave the premiership early, Gantz is to take over the role. Several watchdog groups in Israel, including the Movement for Quality Government in Israel and other groups, reacted to the news by petitioning the Supreme Court to block the formation of the government due to the indictment of Netanyahu. On 7 May 2020, Netanyahu won the support of 72 MKs to form a government, with Rivlin giving Netanyahu a two-week mandate to form a government shortly after. The parties who gave their support included Blue and White, Likud, Derekh Eretz, Gesher, Shas and United Torah Judaism as well as two of the three members of the Labor Party. ==Members of government== On 17 May 2020, the following were announced to the Knesset as members in the new government:Twenty-Third Knesset: Government 35 Knesset ===Ministers=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Portfolio !Minister !colspan=2|Party |- |Prime Minister||Benjamin Netanyahu||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Alternate Prime Minister, Minister of Defense||Benny Gantz||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development||Alon Schuster||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Aliyah and Integration||Pnina Tamano-Shata||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Community Empowerment and Advancement||Orly Levy- Abekasis||bgcolor=| ||Gesher |- |Minister of Communications||Yoaz Hendel|| style=\"background:#2181E5;\"| ||Derekh Eretz |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Minister of Housing and Construction||Yaakov Litzman (05/25/20-09/15/20)||bgcolor=| ||United Torah Judaism |- |Benjamin Netanyahu (09/15/20-Present)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Culture and Sport||Hili Tropper||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Cyber and National Digital Matters||Dudi Amsalem||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister in the Defense Ministry||Michael Biton||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Diaspora Affairs||Omer Yankelevich||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of the Economy||Amir Peretz||bgcolor=| ||Labor |- |Minister of Education||Yoav Gallant||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Environmental Protection||Gila Gamliel||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Finance||Israel Katz||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Foreign Affairs||Gabi Ashkenazi||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Health||Yuli Edelstein ||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Higher Education, Minister of Water||Ze'ev Elkin||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Intelligence||Eli Cohen||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of the Interior, Minister of the Development of the Negev and Galilee||Aryeh Deri||bgcolor=| ||Shas |- |Minister of Jerusalem Affairs||Rafi Peretz||bgcolor=| ||The Jewish Home |- |Minister of Justice||Avi Nissenkorn ||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Social Services||Itzik Shmuli||bgcolor=| ||Labor |- |Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy, and Water||Yuval Steinitz||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Internal Security||Amir Ohana||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Minister of Regional Cooperation||Gilad Erdan (05/25/20-07/05/20)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Ofir Akunis (07/06/20-Present)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister of Religious Affairs||Ya'akov Avitan||bgcolor=| ||Shas |- |Minister of Science and Technology||Yizhar Shai||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Minister of Settlement Affairs||Tzipi Hotovely (05/25/20-08/02/20)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Tzachi Hanegbi (08/03/20-Present)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister for Social Equality||Meirav Cohen||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Strategic Affairs, Minister of Information||Orit Farkash-Hacohen||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Tourism||Asaf Zamir (05/25/20-10/06/20)||bgcolor=| ||Blue and White |- |Minister of Transportation||Miri Regev||bgcolor=| ||Likud |- |Minister without portfolio||Tzachi Hanegbi (05/25/20-08/02/20)||bgcolor=| ||Likud |} ===Deputy ministers=== {| class=wikitable |- !Portfolio !Minister !colspan=2|Party |- |Deputy Prime Minister's Office |Fateen Mulla |style=\"background:| |Likud |- |Deputy Minister of Finance |Yitzhak Cohen |style=\"background:| |Shas |- |Deputy Minister of Internal Security |Gadi Yevarkan |style=\"background:| |Likud |- |Deputy Minister of Health |Yoav Kisch |style=\"background:| |Likud |- |Deputy Minister of Education |Meir Porush |style=\"background:| |United Torah Judaism |- |Deputy Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Social Services |Meshulam Nahari |style=\"background:| |Shas |- |Deputy Minister of Interior |Yoav Ben Tzur |style=\"background:| |Shas |- |Deputy Minister of Transportation |Uri Maklev |style=\"background:| |United Torah Judaism |} == See also == *2020 in Israel *2020 in politics and government *List of members of the twenty-third Knesset == References == == External links == *Thirty- fifth government of Israel.
