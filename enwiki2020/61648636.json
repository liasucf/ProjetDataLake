In 1883 she married Dunedin-based doctor Thomas Morland Hocken in Invercargill. Her husband was a keen collector of documents describing early European settlement in New Zealand, and Hocken used her skills in painting (oils and water-colours), photography and translation to assist him in recording and illustrating his historical work. She painted original works and also copied historical works from private collections to add to those acquired by her husband. Hocken also helped her husband translate the text of Abel Tasman\u2019s 1642 voyage from Dutch to English. Hocken was awarded a prize for flower painting at the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin in 1889\u201390, and exhibited with the Otago Art Society from 1887 to 1914. Hocken died in Johannesburg, South Africa on 19 April 1933. ==References== Category:1848 births Category:1933 deaths Category:19th-century New Zealand painters Category:People from Auckland Category:Buckland family ",
