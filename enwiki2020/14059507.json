They hold an open challenge at their first event for anyone to step up and face Dewey, which is answered by established wrestler Bullfrog Kraus (Montana). Before the match, the father appoints Jim as the referee to ensure that Elmer is not seriously hurt. Kraus dominates the fight and hits Jim and his mother (Myra Keaton) out of spite.
