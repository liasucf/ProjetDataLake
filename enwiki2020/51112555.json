    "text": "Heaven Upside Down is the tenth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 6, 2017 by Loma Vista Recordings and Caroline International. The record had the working title Say10 and was initially due to be issued on Valentine's Day. However, the release was delayed due to Marilyn Manson being unhappy with the quality of the record by that date, as well as the band's touring commitments and producer Tyler Bates's schedule scoring films. It was further delayed by the death of Manson's father Hugh Warner, who died during production and to whom the album was later dedicated. The record features many of the same musicians who performed on the band's previous album, 2015's The Pale Emperor, including Bates and Gil Sharone. Longtime bassist Twiggy did not take part in recording sessions, despite Manson initially suggesting he would. Twiggy departed the group soon after the album was issued after a sexual assault allegation was made against him by a former girlfriend from the 1990s. He was replaced on subsequent tour dates by former the Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete. \"We Know Where You Fucking Live\" preceded the album as its lead single on September 11, followed by \"Kill4Me\" nine days later, which became the band's highest-peaking entry on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. Music videos were created for four tracks: the two aforementioned singles as well as \"Say10\" and \"Tattooed in Reverse\". The videos for \"Kill4Me\" and \"Say10\" feature Johnny Depp, while Courtney Love and Lisa Marie Presley appear in the video for \"Tattooed in Reverse\". The latter also charted on Mainstream Rock, making Heaven Upside Down their first album since 1998's Mechanical Animals to contain more than one song that appeared on the chart. The album received positive reviews from music critics upon release, with multiple publications saying it continued the creative resurgence that began with their previous album, although others criticized the violent lyrical content. It was a commercial success as well, debuting at number eight on the Billboard 200 and becoming their highest- charting album in over a decade in several countries, including major markets such as Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom. Manson was injured on two occasions during the Heaven Upside Down Tour. He sprained his ankle after jumping off the stage at one concert, and was crushed by a large stage prop at another. The latter incident resulted in the rescheduling of an entire leg of the tour. The band also embarked on two co-headlining tours with Rob Zombie: Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour and Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies Tour. To promote the former, the two collaborated on a cover of the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\". Manson issued three other covers on soundtracks during the album's promotional cycle: \"Stigmata\", \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" and \"Cry Little Sister\". ==Background and recording== alt=Image of the band's vocalist wearing black clothes and holding a microphone in his right hand. The background of the image is illuminated with blue stage lighting, and on the bottom left corner the hand of a concert-goer can be seen giving the 'devil- horns' signal. Marilyn Manson met Tyler Bates, the score composer of Californication, while playing a fictionalized version of himself in the season finale of the sixth season of the series. The two then collaborated on 2015's The Pale Emperor, the band's ninth studio album, which was described by numerous publications as the best album they had released in over a decade. In July 2016, Manson received the 'Icon Award' at the APMAs, where he revealed several details about the follow-up to The Pale Emperor, such as its working title of Say10 and a tentative Valentine's Day release date. He explained that the title originated from a note written in one of his workbooks from his time as a student at GlenOak High School. Manson doubted whether Bates would collaborate with him again following The Pale Emperor, saying relations between the pair deteriorated to such an extent during the supporting The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour that Manson threatened Bates on-stage with a box-cutter knife. Despite this confrontation, Bates agreed to work with the band, and renamed his music publishing company Box Cutter Music in honor of the incident. On May 8, 2017, Manson announced the album had been renamed Heaven Upside Down, and said recording had been completed. As with The Pale Emperor, Manson and Bates worked on the record while the latter was composing score material for the American television series Salem, the third season of which featured Manson as a recurring cast member. Parts of the album were recorded in Louisiana, where he was filming scenes for the series. The record was produced solely by Bates, and recorded at Bates's Studio City recording facility Abattoir Studios, with live drums recorded by The Pale Emperor contributor Gil Sharone. Despite initially suggesting that longtime bassist Twiggy would contribute to the writing and production of the album, Manson later confirmed that he was invited but did not participate during sessions at Bates's recording studio. According to Manson, after listening to pre-recorded basslines performed by Bates, Twiggy responded by saying he would be unable to \"play them any better, and that the record sounded great [as it was]\". Manson and Bates largely improvised during their writing sessions. Bates said that songs were created \"out of a conversation, essentially, just between [Manson] and I, and we make it pretty much on the spot. It's me making music right from my head, and the lyrics are developed by Manson right there in the studio with me.\" Manson described the collaborative process between the two as being \"a very intimate, personal experience. ... We sit across from each other, with headphones on, we look each other in the eye when we're writing.\" Manson opted not to record his vocals from inside a vocal booth, instead recording them while sitting at Bates's mixing console; the majority of vocals on the album were recorded in single takes, with minimal overdubbing. Bates sought to incorporate the intensity of the band's live performances into the album's production, describing the record as \"intense, fun and violent. It's more immediate than The Pale Emperor, much more aggressive, and definitely much more imbued with Manson's fucked-up humor.\" He also said: ==Composition and style== The band's vocalist initially described Say10 as being a musical departure from The Pale Emperor, and said it would be more comparable to the band's earlier work, particularly Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals, but \"with a new, different approach\", and said it was \"pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way [as The Pale Emperor]. It's got a chip on its shoulder.\" He called it \"by far the most thematic and over-complicated thing that I've done\", and indicated it would contain some of his most politically-charged lyrics, but denied the political lyrical content related to the election of Donald Trump by saying most of its lyrics were written before the 2016 US presidential election. He had said he would not be voting in that election, explaining: \"I don't think that, as an artist, I can make as much of a difference voting as I can [with] the commentaries I make in music\". Manson dubbed Heaven Upside Down his \"most precise and well-thought-out work\", and compared its lyrics to those of 2000's Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), noting the majority of lyrics on both records were initially written as prose. He additionally described it as a concept album, and contrasted it with The Pale Emperor: \"The last album was Faust, Mephistopheles. For me, this would be Pilgrim's Progress\". Lyrical themes and subject matter on the record range from politics, violence, sex and romance, chaos and isolation, and capitalism, religion, drugs, paranoia, fear and mental illness. Musically, Heaven Upside Down was characterized by Manson as a hard rock and punk rock album, in the vein of Killing Joke, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and David Bowie's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps). Reviewers have additionally defined it as an industrial metal, punk rock, glam rock and gothic rock record. The title of opening track \"Revelation #12\" is a reference to both the Book of Revelation and the Beatles song \"Revolution 9\". \"We Know Where You Fucking Live\" was the first song Manson and Bates recorded for the album; its lyrics reference state surveillance and drone warfare. \"Saturnalia\" was the final song written for the album. Manson described its lyrics as being \"the real heart of the record.\" He was unaware of the severity of his father's terminal illness until two days before he died, on July 7, 2017, the same day the band finished recording \"Saturnalia\". Its lyrics contain numerous astrological and mythological references, specifically the astrological transit of Saturn \u2013 Saturn return \u2013 and the myth of Saturnus devouring his children. Manson conflated his father's death with the lyrical content: \"Seeing my father dying, I felt like that was the circle of life that he'd want me to put the energy of death into rebirth, you know, the snake eating its own tail, Saturnalia, Saturninus, that whole concept.\" \"Je$u$ Cri$i$\" was described by Manson as \"my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ... It's basically something I would say with a [sarcastic] shrug when someone asked me, 'What do you do?' 'Well, I write songs to fight and fuck to.' He elaborated on the meaning of Heaven Upside Down as an album title: \"I was going to call the record SAY10, but I didn't feel that that defined the album. I had the lyrics written for the song 'Heaven Upside Down', and I thought that defined the record more so because of the idea of time as a flat circle, constellations being defined by the negative space\u2014the blackness; the idea of looking at something from an opposite point of view.\" ==Release and artwork== The album was not released on Valentine's Day, prompting increasingly aggressive responses from fans on social media platforms. Manson later explained several factors caused the delay, including Bates's schedule scoring films, Manson being unhappy with the quality of the record by that date, as well as the death of his father, to whom Heaven Upside Down is dedicated. Bates also said recording was delayed due to the band's touring schedule; the pair had completed just six songs before beginning a co-headlining tour with Slipknot in the summer of 2016. At least three tracks were recorded sometime after Valentine's Day: \"Revelation #12\", \"Saturnalia\" and \"Heaven Upside Down\", with the album's name then being changed to the latter song title. Prior to the record's eventual release, Manson posted a series of videos on Instagram. The first of these, posted on March 22, 2017, was captioned \"6:19. The time has come.\" Numerous publications hypothesized whether 6:19 referred to a June 19 release date, a Bible verse, or the Eat Me, Drink Me track \"If I Was Your Vampire\", which features the lyric \"6:19 and I know I'm ready\". Further videos featured air-raid sirens and distant screaming, a hooded figure, and the Celebritarian Cross\u2014an inverted variation on the Cross of Lorraine that had been previously used by Manson as a logo for his Celebritarian art movement in 2005; the symbol subsequently appeared on the Heaven Upside Down album cover. Heaven Upside Down was released worldwide on October 6, 2017, by Loma Vista Recordings in the United States, Caroline International internationally, and in Japan by Loma Vista in cooperation with Hostess Entertainment; Japanese editions contain a Mystery Skulls remix of \"Kill4Me\" as a bonus track. The booklet was printed on Bible paper, with the lyrics formatted to resemble biblical text. The record was mastered by Brian Lucey, the engineer who masters the majority of Bates's soundtrack work. According to Manson, Lucey was chosen because the album contains \"some extreme experiments with sound. We were very particular in not allowing someone else to master it, who might accidentally eliminate them. We've got some very intense, alchemical, scientific, binaural sounds that sometimes even make me have a panic attack while I'm listening to it.\" These sounds are most prevalent in the title track and \"Saturnalia\", which Manson highlighted as centerpieces of the record. ==Promotion and singles== Manson performing at the alt=Image of the band's vocalist using stilts and wearing a long robe made of black feathers. In his hands are two elongated stilts, which he is holding aloft. The background of the stage is illuminated with orange stage lighting, and in the foreground numerous fans can be seen giving the 'devil-horns' signal. On the day of the 2016 US presidential election \u2013 November 8 \u2013 the band released a short teaser clip of a new video, \"Say10\". Created by director Tyler Shields, it featured images of Manson brandishing a bloodstained knife while standing above a decapitated corpse lying in a pool of blood. Numerous publications noted the corpse was dressed in similar clothing to the kind regularly worn by Donald Trump\u2014a suit and red tie. Manson would later say the decapitated figure in the video \"wasn't anyone except if you wanted it to be them.\" The band \u2013 which initially included Manson on vocals with Bates and Paul Wiley on electric guitars, Twiggy on bass and Sharone on drums \u2013 began the first leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20, 2017 in Budapest, during which they debuted several new songs. During the tour, the group narrowly avoided injury in Moscow when their tour bus was involved in a collision with a semi-trailer truck, and Manson caused controversy in Eastern Europe when he referenced the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War during a concert in Kiev, saying: \"You just made Moscow sound like your bitch.\" The band performed in Moscow two days prior to the Kiev concert. Their cover of Ministry's \"Stigmata\" was released on July 28, when it appeared on the soundtrack to Atomic Blonde. \"We Know Where You Fucking Live\" was issued as the album's lead single on September 11, after premiering on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show. Its music video was directed by Bill Yukich and Perou, and was posted onto YouTube four days later. \"Kill4Me\" was issued as the album's primary airplay single in the United States, where it went on to become their highest peaking single ever on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. A series of advertisements created by Canadian pop artist Alex Kazemi to promote the album on Instagram were leaked online in late September, but were deemed too graphic to be used on the image hosting service. Music videos were subsequently released for \"Say10\" and \"Kill4Me\", both directed by Yukich and featured actor Johnny Depp. The North American leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour began on September 27, and was scheduled to incorporate appearances by the band at several music festivals, including the Aftershock Festival on October 22, at which Nine Inch Nails was also scheduled to appear. Manson indicated a possibility of joining that band on stage during the festival, after he and Trent Reznor mended a longstanding feud. However, Manson was injured on several occasions during the tour; he sprained his left ankle after jumping off the stage at Pittsburgh's Stage AE on September 29. The following night, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, he was crushed by a large stage prop, and lay unconscious on the stage for up to 15 minutes before being carried out of the venue on a stretcher to a nearby hospital. Manson had broken his fibula in two places, requiring a plate and ten screws to be inserted into his bone. The rest of the tour was then canceled, including their appearance at Aftershock, with all dates \u2013 excluding festival appearances \u2013 rescheduled to take place at the start of 2018. The band's founding guitarist, Daisy Berkowitz, died on October 22, 2017 at the age of 49; he had been diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer in 2013. Three days later, Manson announced he had \"decided to part ways\" with Twiggy after the bassist was accused of sexual assault by former girlfriend Jessicka Addams, who was the vocalist for alternative rock band Jack Off Jill. Addams said the incident occurred while she and Twiggy were a couple in the mid-90s. He was replaced on subsequent tour dates by former Racer X and the Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete. Alderete's first show with the band, at the 2017 Ozzfest Meets Knotfest festival in San Bernardino on November 5, found Manson performing in a wheelchair as a result of injuries he sustained earlier in the tour. Manson attracted criticism from some publications after he used a replica assault rifle as a microphone during the concert, with some commentators arguing it was insensitive considering the city had previously been the subject of a terrorism-related attack, and that the concert took place hours after the Sutherland Springs church shooting in Texas. A cover of \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" \u2013 recorded during the Heaven Upside Down sessions \u2013 was featured on the soundtrack to 24 Hours to Live, and was issued through Var\u00e8se Sarabande on December 8. \"Tattooed in Reverse\" was released as a promotional single when it was serviced to active rock radio formats in the United States on March 6, 2018, and peaked at number 35 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. This made Heaven Upside Down the band's first studio album since 1998's Mechanical Animals to contain more than one charting song on Mainstream Rock. The song's music video was directed by Yukich, and featured singers Courtney Love and Lisa Marie Presley. Yukich also directed the music video for the band's cover version of Gerard McMahon's \"Cry Little Sister\", released in June and recorded for the soundtrack of The New Mutants. The band embarked on a second co- headlining tour with Rob Zombie on July 11, titled \"Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour\", following the \"Twins of Evil Tour\" in 2012. On the day the tour began, Zombie and Manson released their cover of the Beatles track \"Helter Skelter\", which featured former Manson band members John 5 and Ginger Fish. Heaven Upside Down was the last album to feature Sharone, who departed the band in March 2019. He was replaced on the subsequent \"Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies Tour\" by former Black Flag and Ho99o9 drummer Brandon Pertzborn. Shortly after the tour completed, Alderete was involved in a bicycle accident which left him with a diffuse axonal injury, a type of traumatic brain injury. A GoFundMe page was created to help cover the cost of his medical expenses. Despite this, Alderete is a credited performer on the band's next studio album, 2020's We Are Chaos. ==Critical reception== The album was well received by music critics upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally positive reviews\". Album of the Year collected 19 reviews and calculated an average of 66 out of 100. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album 6.2 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Several publications said the record continued a creative resurgence that began with their previous release, including AllMusic, which described it as a more satisfying album than the predecessor. This sentiment was echoed by both Loudwire, and The Boston Globe, which said: \"No one expected this band to be doing some of its best work 20 years after it first shook up the zeitgeist, but here it is, continuing to evolve while toning down its more dated or cartoonish aspects. It just goes to show that a good album beats a good scandal every time.\" Bloody Disgusting said it was their best release since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), and Loudwire included it on their list of the best hard rock albums of 2017. Consequence of Sound commented on Manson's stage injury: \"Had the worst happened, Heaven Upside Down is the kind of career-defining record that [he] just might want to leave as his last great opus anyway.\" Numerous publications lauded it for being a solid and concise album. Metal Injection commended the quality of songwriting, saying the record consistently introduced different styles and genres throughout. Similarly, Clash complimented the band for mixing various styles from their discography, saying that Heaven Upside Down fused three distinct genres from their previous work\u2014the industrial of Antichrist Superstar, the glam rock of Mechanical Animals, and the blues of The Pale Emperor. ABC News said it saw Manson returning \"to his roots\", which they described as him \"playing overtly with taboos and openly baiting his critics.\" Classic Rocks sister publication Metal Hammer described it as a solid album and said it illustrates how Manson can \"still do what he got famous [for] doing: write biting, anti-establishment goth rock full of dark, playful imagery.\" Singapore's The Straits Times dubbed it the album of the week while describing the record as exhilarating. Critics praised the quality of lyricism found on the album, specifically in light of the presidential election of Donald Trump. The Evening Standard said: \"American life is scary enough right now without Marilyn Manson sticking his oar in. Nevertheless, [Heaven Upside Down] may offer some useful catharsis for those who feel like screaming\", although their writer noted it \"offers zero reasons to be cheerful.\" Similarly, The List asked: \"Is Marilyn Manson the first or the last person we need to hear in these troubled times?\" while comparing the lyrical content to Grand Guignol, a term used to describe graphic, amoral horror entertainment. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock called it an astute album, saying that the band \"update and renovate the goth-glam dazzle of Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar to better ram home [Manson's] top-line points: that religion is a pointless poison, politicians are society's true Satans and that fighting and fucking are the only reasoned responses to the current countdown to the Book of Revelations apocalypse that the world has chosen democratically for itself.\" Alternative Press also commended the lyrical quality, saying the record was best enjoyed on headphones where the lyrics would \"make your bladder flex. ... At the end of the [record], all that's missing is the sound of the [microphone] dropping.\" The album received some mixed reviews as well, with several writers criticizing the lyrics to \"Je$u$ Cri$i$\". Spin criticized the \"reprehensible\" violent lyrical content found on the record, in light of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Conversely, Pitchfork said the lyrics were ineffectual, arguing they were easily eclipsed by the horror found in real life. Both Crack Magazine and PopMatters complimented the inclusion of punk elements, which the latter said helped the album match the intensity of the band's earlier work, but they were both critical of the lyrics. NME argued the record was too similar to the band's earlier work, and complained most of the songs lacked innovation. Drowned in Sound said that fans were \"unlikely to see the power or the passion of Manson's classic run again \u2013 it's very difficult to bottle lightning twice ... That said, [Manson] seems to have settled after many years of free-fall. In Tyler Bates he has found a collaborator who knows how to get the best from his twisted mind. It's business as usual, but after a decade of disappointment, it's good to know business is doing well.\" ==Commercial performance== Heaven Upside Down debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 with 35,000 album-equivalent units, 32,000 of which were pure album sales, making it the band's seventh consecutive top ten album on the chart. Industry forecasters had predicted it was on course to debut in the top ten with sales of between 25,000 and 32,000 copies. It became the band's fourth consecutive number one album on Billboards Top Hard Rock Albums, and their first to reach number one on Top Alternative Albums. It also debuted at number two on both Top Rock Albums and Top Album Sales, which acts as the current equivalent of the previous Billboard 200, before it was reconfigured to incorporate album-equivalent units. On its second week, the record dropped to number 84 on the Billboard 200.

In Canada, Heaven Upside Down matched the peak of The Pale Emperor by debuting at number four. The record was predicted to enter the top ten of the UK Albums Chart, making it the band's first top ten album in the country since Eat Me, Drink Me peaked at number eight a decade earlier. It went on to peak at number seven there with first-week sales of 6,636 copies \u2013 their highest opening week figure since The High End of Low debuted with 7,746 copies in 2009 \u2013 and the band's highest-charting album in the country since The Golden Age of Grotesque peaked at number four in 2003. In Spain, the album peaked at number six, making it their highest-charting album since The Golden Age of Grotesque peaked at number five 12 years earlier. The record debuted in France with sales of 4,745 copies. Heaven Upside Down entered the ARIA Charts at number four, making it their sixth top ten album in Australia, and their highest-charting since Mechanical Animals reached number one in 1998. It entered at number six on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, their fifth top ten studio album there. On the Japanese Oricon chart, the album debuted at number 29 with first week sales of 1,805 copies\u2014exactly half the amount The Pale Emperor debuted with two years earlier. ==Track listing== * \"We Know Where You Fucking Live\", \"Say10\" and \"Kill4Me\" are stylized in all caps; \"Jesus Crisis\" is stylized as \"JE$U$ CRI$I$\". ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Heaven Upside Down. * Marilyn Manson \u2013 vocals * Tyler Bates \u2013 guitars, bass, keyboards, programming, engineering, recording, production, mixing * Gil Sharone \u2013 drums * Dana Dentata \u2013 backing vocals * Roger Joseph Manning Jr. \u2013 clavinet * Robert Carranza \u2013 mixing * Joanne Higginbottom \u2013 assistant engineer * Olivia Jaffe \u2013 hexagram sigil * Brian Lucey \u2013 mastering * Perou \u2013 photography * Brian Roettinger \u2013 art direction ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (\u00d63 Austria) |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) |20 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) |12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (Billboard) |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Czech Albums (\u010cNS IFPI) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Danish Vinyl Albums (Hitlisten) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (Dutch Charts) |28 |- !scope=\"row\"|Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|French Albums (SN\u00c9P) |15 |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) |9 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Greek Albums (IFPI Greece) |10 |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ) |18 |- !scope=\"row\"|Irish Albums (IRMA) |35 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italian Albums (FIMI) |14 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon) |29 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Japanese International Albums (Oricon) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) |6 |- !scope=\"row\"|Polish Albums (ZPAV) |18 |- !scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP) |20 |- !scope=\"row\"|Scottish Albums (OCC) |5 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Slovak Albums (\u010cNS IFPI) Note: To access information from this reference, user must define SK \u2013 Albums \u2013 Top 100 and 201741 as the search parameters, and then click Zobrazit |10 |- !scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (Prom\u00fasicae) |6 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan) |14 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Swiss Hitparade) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Rock & Metal Albums (OCC) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Album Sales (Billboard) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Alternative Albums (Billboard) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Hard Rock Albums (Billboard) |1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Hard Rock Albums (Billboard) | 36 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) | 89 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Current Album Sales (Billboard) | 198 |} ==References== Notes References Category:2017 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Glam rock albums by American artists Category:Gothic rock albums by American artists Category:Loma Vista Recordings albums Category:Marilyn Manson (band) albums Category:Punk rock albums by American artists ",
