    "text": "The Principality of the Brian\u00e7onese (Principato del Brianzonese or Principaut\u00e9 du Brian\u00e7onnais) was a collection of mountain territories located around Mount Viso, with territory between Marseille and Turin. It had lands in what is now the French department of Hautes-Alpes, the province of Turin and province of Cuneo. It was named after its capital. From the 19th century onwards it was known as the Republic of the Escartons (Italian: Repubblica degli Escartons; French: R\u00e9publique des \u00c9cartons), although the concept of a republic is anachronistic in the period covered by the principality. Escartons corresponds to the Occitan name for Brian\u00e7on and in French '\u00e9carter' means 'to divide', specifically 'to divide taxes into quarters'. It consisted of a set of mountain territories in what is now the French department of Hautes-Alpes, the province of Turin and province of Cuneo. It enjoyed fiscal and political privileges from the French and although not very large, it had more than forty thousand inhabitants. Every year the leaders of various countries forming the Republic met in council to elect a consul as its leader. Guigues VII of Viennois conceded the inhabitants of Brian\u00e7on a charter of liberty in 1244, which was confirmed as a grand charter on 29 May 1343 by his successor Humbert II of Viennois at Beauvoir-en-Royans - he signed it with 18 representatives of the Alpine valleys. This gave birth to the Escartons republic, made up of five separate valleys \u2013 Brian\u00e7onnais, Oulx, Casteldelfino, Val Chisone, and Queyras. The charter was later confirmed by letters patent from all the kings of France from Charles V of France to Louis XVI of France \u2013 after the Treaty of Utrecht, this continued until 4 August 1789 for the parts of the Republic which remained French territory. ==External links== *http://www.escarton.it/ Category:1343 establishments in Europe Category:1340s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1789 disestablishments in France ",
