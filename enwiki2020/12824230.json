(1948). The People Speedway Guide. Odhams Press Limited ==Career== Lawson first came to the UK in 1939 and rode in two leagues for the Wembley Lions and Middlesbrough Bears but at his mother's insistence, his sister accompanied him as chaperone. It was not until after the war in 1947 that he returned to the UK when league racing started again. He joined the West Ham Hammers where he stayed for five seasons, top scoring in three of them. In 1951 he won the London Riders' Championship whilst riding for the Hammers.Belton, Brian (2003). Hammerin' Round. After a year back in Australia he returned to the UK where he joined the Norwich Stars, where he remained until he retired from racing in 1960. Lawson then returned to Australia where he continued racing in Sydney, winning his then record 5th NSW Championship in 1963, adding to those he had won in 1948, 1950, 1953 and 1954.NSW Championships section ==World final appearances== * 1939 - London, Wembley Stadium - Event cancelled due to World War II * 1949 - London, Wembley Stadium - 8th - 8pts * 1950 - London, Wembley Stadium - 4th - 10pts * 1951 - London, Wembley Stadium - 10th - 7pts * 1953 - London, Wembley Stadium - 9th - 7pts * 1954 - London, Wembley Stadium - 14th - 4pts * 1957 - London, Wembley Stadium - 4th - 11pts * 1958 - London, Wembley Stadium - 3rd - 11pts * 1959 - London, Wembley Stadium - 5th - 11pts * 1960 - London, Wembley Stadium - 14th - 4ptsBamford, R. & Shailes, G.
