    "text": "Barrhead-Westlock was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first-past-the-post method of voting from 1993 to 2004. ==History== ===Boundary history=== Barrhead-Westlock was created from Barrhead, Westlock- Sturgeon and a small portion of Athabasca-Lac La Biche in 1993. Its largest communities were its namesake towns Barrhead and Westlock, as well as the town of Swan Hills. Its boundaries remained unchanged in the redistribution that took effect in 1997. The riding was replaced by Barrhead-Morinville-Westlock in the 2003 electoral boundary re-distribution, which covered the entire area of Barrhead-Westlock and a small portion of Redwater. ===Representation history=== {|class=wikitable align=right !colspan=5|Members of the Legislative Assembly for Barrhead-Westlock |- !Assembly !Years !colspan=2|Member !Party |- |colspan=5 align=right|See Barrhead 1971-1993 and Westlock-Sturgeon 1986-1993. |- |23rd |1993-1997 |rowspan=3 | |rowspan=3|Ken Kowalski |rowspan=3|Progressive Conservative |- |24th |1997-2001 |- |25th |2001-2004 |- |colspan=5 align=center|See Barrhead-Morinville-Westlock electoral district from 2004-2019 |} Barrhead-Westlock's only MLA was Ken Kowalski, who had already served as the Progressive Conservative member for Barrhead since 1979.
