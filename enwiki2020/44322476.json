He is currently on the faculty of the Creative Writing MFA Program at Fairleigh Dickinson University. ==Career== Schrefer has published eleven books to date. In reviewing his novel Endangered, The New York Times praised the depth of his characters, saying \"As riveting as the action is, it\u2019s the nuanced portraits of the characters, human and ape, that make the story so deeply affecting.\" Dennis Abrams of Publishing Perspectives, also discussed in his review of Threatened, the way in which Schrefer \"even makes his chimpanzees\u2026into living breathing characters.\" In drawing parallels between the bonobo apes and human characters in these novels, Schrefer says that writing about the bonobos \"allowed me to address more nakedly the feelings\u2014jealousy, loyalty, anger, sorrow\u2014that we all experience.\" ==List of works== ===The Ape Quartet=== *Endangered (Scholastic, 2012) *Threatened (Scholastic, 2014) *Rescued (Scholastic, 2016) *Orphaned (Scholastic, September 25, 2018) ===The Lost Rainforest=== *Mez's Magic (Katherine Tegen Books, January 2, 2018) *Gogi's Gambit (Jaden Tegen Books, February 5, 2019) ===Spirit Animals=== *Spirit Animals book 6: Rise and Fall (Scholastic, 2014) *Spirit Animals (Fall of the Beasts) book 1: Immortal Guardians (Scholastic, 2015) ===Other work=== *Glamorous Disasters (Simon & Schuster, 2006) *The New Kid (Simon & Schuster, 2007) *Hack the SAT (Gotham Books, 2008) *The School for Dangerous Girls (Scholastic, 2009) *The Deadly Sister (Scholastic, 2010) *Greek Fantasy Novel (Scholastic, 2011) ==References== ==External links== * * * E.
