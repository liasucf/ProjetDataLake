    "text": "The J.M. McClintock House is a historic house at 43 Magnolia Street in Marianna, Arkansas. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, designed by Charles L. Thompson and built in 1912, whose Craftsman/Bungalow styling is in marked contrast to the W.S. McClintock House, a Colonial Revival structure designed by Thompson for another member of the McClintock family and built the same year. This house has the broad sweeping roof line with exposed rafters covering a porch supported by brick piers and paired wooden box posts on either side of the centered stair. A dormer with clipped-gable roof is centered above the entry. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==See also== *W. S.
