    "text": "One of four main entrances to the Harmandir Sahib, one of the holiest shrines of Sikhism Sarbat Khalsa (entire Khalsa; Punjabi: (Gurumukhi)), was a biannual deliberative assembly (on the same lines as a Parliament in a Direct Democracy) of the Sikhs held at Amritsar in Panjab during the 18th century. It literally translates to the \"entire Sikh Nation\" but as a political institution it refers to the meetings of the Dal Khalsa, Sikh Misls, and the legislature of the Sikh Empire.The first Sarbat Khalsa was called by the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh before his death in 1708 and the tradition of calling Sarbat Khalsa has continued ever since at times of hardship or conflict. After the demolition of the Mahant System by the Khalsa Panth, S. Kartar Singh Jhabbar called the Sarbat Khalsa in 1920. He was not the Jathedar of Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib but a Sikh leader. In the resolution of that Sarbat Khalsa, Teja Singh Bhuchhar was announced as the Jathedar of Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib. Next known meeting of the Sarbat Khalsa took place on the occasion of Divali in 1723 when a clash between Tat Khalsa and the Bandais (owing fealty to Banda Singh Bahadur) was averted and amicably settled through the intervention and wise counsel of Bhai Mani Singh. The next notable Sarbat Khalsa, which was held soon after the martyrdom of Bhai Tara Singh Wan in 1726, passed a gurmata (the decisions of the Sarbat Khalsa), laying down a threefold plan of action: to plunder government treasures in transit between local and regional offices and the central treasury; to raid government armouries for weapons and government stables for horses and carriages; and to eliminate government informers and lackeys. Another Sarbat Khalsa assembled in 1733 to deliberate upon and accept the government\u2019s offer of a Nawabship and jagir to the Panth. Under a gurmata of the Sarbat Khalsa on 14 October (Divali day) 1745, the active fighting force of the Sikhs was reorganized into 25 jathas (bands) of about 100 each. A further reorganization into 11 misls (divisions) forming the Dal Khalsa was made by the Sarbat Khalsa on Baisakhi, 29 March 1748. Thus, Sarbat Khalsa became the central body of what J.D. Cunningham, in his book, A History of the Sikhs, terms a \u201ctheocratic confederate feudalism\u201d established by the misls. On 29 April 1986, a Sarbat Khalsa at the Golden Temple declared the creation of Khalistan. ==History== After the death of Banda Singh Bahadur in 1716 the Khalsa was in disarray. After 1716, the Mughal government began a campaign of genocide against Sikhs led by Abdus Samad Khan and later his son Zakariya Khan that was carried out by in the form of a standing army dedicated to eliminating Sikhs, daily public executions, and monetary rewards for the heads of killed Sikhs. The Dal Khalsa \"reataliated by killing government functionaries and plundering Mughal posts, arsenals, and treasuries\". In 1733, because of the failure of the Mughal government to subdue the Sikhs they were offered a jagir in 1733. Nawab Kapur Singh was appointed head of the Dal Khalsa and he reorganized the Sikhs into the Taruna Dal and Budda Dal. The Taruna Dal formed the basis of the Sikh Misls. ===Significant Gurmatas=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Significance |- |October/November 1723 |Tat Khalsa and Bandais settle their differences |- |1726 |Sarbat Khalsa passes Gurmata to raid Mughal precious metal transports, confiscate Mugal armories, and eliminate Mughal informers |- |1733 |Sarbat Khalsa accepts Jagir given by Mughal government |- |October 14, 1745 |Sarbat Khalsa passes Gurmata organizing Khalsa into 25 Jathas |- |March 29, 1748 |Sarbat Khalsa passes Gurmata reorganizing Khalsa into 11 Misls |- | November 7, 1760 | Sarbat Khalsa passes Gurmata to attack Lahore |- |January 26, 1986 |Sarbat Khalsa elects and inaugurates 5 member panthik committee to make decisions on behalf of the Sikh diaspora.

The body then chose Panj Piare, or five members, to act as the governing body of the mass meeting. To become one of the Panj Piare members would have to be nominated, answer objections from the assembly, and be subject to a direct vote. After their election the Panj Piare sat next to the Guru Granth Sahib on the Akal Takht of Harmandir Sahib. Members put proposals up for consideration and the Panj Piare intervened in disputes that came up during the assembly. A proposal passed by the Sarbat Khalsa, known as a Gurmata (The Guru's decision) was binding on all Sikhs. == Sarbat Khalsa 2015 == Sarbat Khalsa 2015 was held on November 10, 2015 in the Chabba village on the outskirts of Amritsar, with the purpose to strengthen all Sikh institutions and traditions. As many as 100,000 to over 500,000 Sikhs from around the world attended the event. A few Sikh organizations did not attend the event and refused to recognize the resolutions passed. The event was also opposed by Parkash Singh Badal, the Chief Minister of Punjab. The event was called by Simranjit Singh Mann and Mohkam Singh, leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) and United Akali Dal respectively.
