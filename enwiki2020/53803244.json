Until landing there were no issues during the flight to Nalchik. The air traffic controller informed the flight crew of the weather conditions at the airport, but failed to mention the issue of ice; hence the crew did not activate the de-icing system for the approach. When the flight was 13 kilometers away from the runway, the crew set the flaps at 15\u00b0. At 8 kilometers from the runway, the aircraft entered the glide path, after which the flaps were set to 35\u00b0. 16 seconds later, the crew increased the engine power to maintain a consistent speed of 260 km/h. The flight was already 40 meters above the glide path and the pilots adjusted the elevators from 1 to 5\u00b0 deflection, only for the elevators to spontaneously go to 15\u00b0 deflection. At an altitude of 320 meters the aircraft pitched nose-down 50-55\u00b0 into a rapid descent; the pilots pulled back on the control columns; but due being at a low altitude the aircraft was unable to recover from the dive, the aircraft crashed into a field and was quickly engulfed in flames. == Cause == The investigation concluded that causes of the accident were as follows: * Failure of the airport to update the weather report and notify pilots; * untimely notification of the dangerous weather forecast; * incorrect recommendations for executing an approach laid out in the aircraft flight manual; * failure to use the aircraft de-icing system; * failure to follow procedures as outlined in the aircraft flight manual. == References == Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1994 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Russia Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-12 Category:1994 disasters in Russia Category:February 1994 events in Europe ",
