    "text": "The 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament will be the 62nd edition of the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament, a postseason tournament to determine the national champion of NCAA Division I men's college soccer. Pending developments with the COVID-19 pandemic, the first four rounds of the competition will be held at the home ground of the higher seed, while the College Cup (semifinals and final) will be held at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, California. The championship match was originally scheduled to take place on December 13, 2020. On August 13, 2020 the tournament was postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although the possibility of playing the tournament during the Spring 2021 remained. On September 10, 2020, TopDrawerSoccer.com reported that the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament would tentatively be rescheduled from April 30 to May 17, 2021. This was approved on September 16, 2020, with a reduced tournament field size of 36 teams. == Qualification == Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition of the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament will only feature 36 teams. Of the 36 berths, 24 are allocated to the 20 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Mid-American Conference, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. This will include the champions of the ACC and Sun Belt, who will have their conference championships in the fall. The additional 12 berths will be determined via at-large based upon the Rating Percentage Index (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify. === Qualified teams === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !style=\"width:12%;\"| Team !style=\"width:13%;\"| Qualified as !style=\"width:10%;\"| Qualified on !style=\"width:10%;\"| Qualification type !style=\"width:25%; data-sort- type=\"number\"|Previous appearances in tournament !style=\"width:20%;\"|Previous best performance |- | || Sun Belt champions || || Automatic || || |- | || ACC champions || || Automatic || || |- | || Am.
