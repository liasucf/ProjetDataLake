    "text": "The A5012 road is a main road in the south of the English county of Derbyshire. Around in length it connects two primary north-south routes, the A6 at Cromford and the A515 between Buxton and Ashbourne. It passes through Pikehall and Grangemill and alongside Ible. The eastern part (Grangemill to Cromford, set in a deep valley) is known as the Via Gellia - named after its builders, the Gell family, who held lead-mining interests in and around Wirksworth. The road has a poor safety record and is ranked the third-worst in Britain by EuroRAP.EuroRAP press release ==References== Category:Roads in England Category:Roads in Derbyshire ",
