Both Stewards of Memphis Ipy, also transliterated as Apy, was a court official from the time of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten during the Egyptian 18th Dynasty. Ipy was High Steward of Memphis, and a royal scribe. ==Biography== Ipy came from a family of well-known court officials. He was the son of Amenhotep (Huy), the High steward of Memphis and his wife May, and he was the grandson of the Mayor of Memphis Heby. The Vizier Ramose was an uncle of Ipy.Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Egypt from Golden age to Age of Heresy, The American University in Cairo Press, 2014 Ipy succeeded his father sometime after the first Heb-Sed festival of Amenhotep III. He appears in the tomb of his uncle Ramose at the end of the reign of Amenhotep III when he has taken over his father's duties.O'Connor, David and Cline, Eric H. Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign University of Michigan Press. 2001 He continued in office under Akhenaten, and eventually did not just work in Memphis, but was a presence in Akhetaten as well. In Akhenaten's year five Ipy wrote a report to the King reporting that both state and temple properties in Memphis were faring well. After that Ipy became the Overseer of the inner palace of pharaoh in Akhetaten. Ipy is known to have had a house in this city as well. ==Tombs== According to Dodson Ipy had a tomb prepared in Thebes, namely TT136. This tomb is said to have included four images of Akhenaten in an Osirian pose. However Ipy was never residing in Thebes, making it unlikely that he was the owner of this tomb.St\u00e9phane Pasquali, Beatrix, Gessler=Loehr: Un nouveau relief du grand intendant de Memphis, Ipy, et le temple de Ptah du terrain-b\u02bf\u1e25, in: BIFAO 111 (2011), p. 288 online Ipy may have also had a tomb prepared in Amarna. This tomb is now known as tomb 10. The tomb is small and unfinished. William C. Hayes questions the identification of the Ipy from Amarna with the Ipy from Memphis based on the lack of titles borne by the Amarna official.William C. Hayes: A Writing-Palette of the Chief Steward Amen\u1e25otpe and Some Notes on Its Owner, in: The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Jun., 1938), pp. 9-24 Ipy is only given the titles of royal scribe and steward. The tomb contains typical elements such as a copy of the Great Hymn to the Aten and scenes of the royal family worshipping the Aten. Akhenaten and Nefertiti are for instance shown offering votive items \u2013 cartouches of the Aten flanked by small statue(s) \u2013 to the Aten. Meritaten, Meketaten and Ankhesenpaaten are shown behind their parents shaking sistra.The rock tombs of el-Amarna, Parts III and IV: Part 3 The tombs of Huya and Ahmes & Part 4 The tombs of Penthu, Mahu, and Others Egypt Exploration Society (2004), The tomb is described in Chapter 4 of Part IV Martin mentions a tomb for Ipy in Memphis. This tomb has not been located however.G.T. Martin: Hidden Tombs of Memphis, Thames and Hudson, London 1991. p. 200 The tomb is likely located not far from the tomb of his father Amenhotep (Huy). Two of Ipy's canopic jars were found by Giovanni Anastasi, and are now in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden. A relief from his Memphite tomb appeared before 2011 on the art market.St\u00e9phane Pasquali, Beatrix, Gessler=Loehr: Un nouveau relief du grand intendant de Memphis, Ipy, et le temple de Ptah du terrain-b\u02bf\u1e25, in: BIFAO 111 (2011), pp. 281-299 online ==References== Category:Officials of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt Category:14th-century BC people Category:Ancient Egyptian high stewards Category:Amarna Period ",
