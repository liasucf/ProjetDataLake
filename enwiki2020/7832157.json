In this album Glay takes a new turn and dabbles in genres such as gospel, R&B; and blues. The band's leader, Takuro, wanted an album made for the people closest to him, which resulted in \"UR&FA;\". \"...people like my family members, lovers, friends, staff, acquaintance relationships, and the people I have around me greatly influence my work, and I wanted to make one album about that. My keyword was \"roots\". And, after that I had \"unity\". ...I wanted to do this theme one time. We did a gospel sound in order to represent these people the closest.\" (Takuro) ==Track listing== #We All Feel His Strength of Tender - 6:41 # - 3:54 #Girlish Moon - 6:22 #Way of Difference - 4:45 # - 4:59 # - 4:58 # - 2:54 #Neverland - 3:33 # - 2:59 #Father & Son - 4:04 # - 4:52 #Friend of Mine - 6:04 #All Standard Is You -End Roll- (Arranged by Glay, Masahide Sakuma, and dj honda) - 4:16 * All lyrics and compositions by Takuro, except #8 (music by Jiro), musical arrangements by Glay and Masashide Sakuma, except when noted. ==Album chart information== Oricon Top Ranking: #1 Weeks on: 16 Overall Glay Ranking: #8 (NOTE: Overall Glay Ranking is how it is ranked against Glay's other albums according to the Oricon) ==References== * Oricon - Glay's profile on the Oricon * Happy Swing Space Site - Official Site Category:Glay albums Category:2002 albums Category:Pony Canyon albums ",
