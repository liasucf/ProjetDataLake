It was released on September 7, 2018 by EQT Recordings, LLC. ==Background== In an interview with Billboard, Masego refers to the style of this album as TrapHouseJazz, and also said \"my previous projects have different energy, and I feel like I\u2019ve graduated to a more mature version of myself -- my beard\u2019s almost connected, my man body\u2019s comin\u2019 in.\" The album guest features production from FKJ, SiR, Tiffany Gouch\u00e9, and De' Wayne Jackson. Production was handled by Masego, Kojoa Asamoah, Jasper, Jah, Justin Bryant, Oliver Jonas Bergqvist, Sounwave, and French Kiwi Juice. ==Promotion and singles== After filming a jam session in March, Masego and FKJ released the official single for Tadow on October 17, 2017. In celebration of his birthday, the second single \"Lady Lady\" was released on June 8, 2018. Two weeks before the album, the third single, \"Old Age\" featuring SiR was released. ==Critical reception== Pitchfork gave the album a 7.3 out of 10 saying, \"His music is sophisticated, steeped in 1980s quiet-storm R&B; with hints of smooth jazz along the fringes,\" and \"Lady Lady is a grand coming-of-age record that displays the playful and reflective halves of Masego, illuminating his versatile nature with the promise of more to come.\" Exclaim! also gave a positive review of the album saying, \"when applied to his music, his penchant for jumping from place to place means big payoffs for his audience. On Lady Lady, no two songs sound alike, although they complement each other perfectly.\" ==Track listing== ;Notes * \"Lady Lady\" contains a sample of \"Prototype\" performed by Outkast * \"Sugar Walls\" contains uncredited vocals from Ari Lennox * \"24 Hr. Relationship\" contains uncredited vocals from Kehlani ==References== Category:2018 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Sounwave ",
