One of such roads considered to be built in 1850 but the first highway that established around the residential area was located in Lachin region which was included to Yelizavetpol Governorate (starting from 1918, its name was changed to Ganja Governorate). In the following decade, Yevlakh- Shusha-Nakhchivan-Erevan highway constructed (1860). Due to importation of automobiles in 20th century, more ways were started to be built and even a road construction organization was set up in 1918 equipped with 15 trucks, 12 road rollers and 4 graders. During the period of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, \u201cMinistry of Roads, Post and Telegraph\u201d was replaced that organization. From the collapse of ADR to the starting of ww2, various organizations had control over the roads of Azerbaijan such as Highway and Dirt Roads Department (1920), Highway-Water Economy Department (1921), Highway Roads Department (1937). The Kish bridge in Shaki district was built in those years (1925-1932). During and after ww2, the road construction process gained momentum and several highways built in this period such as Baku-Agstafa (1944-1945, 461 km length), Ujar-Zardab and Hajigabul-Salyan (1958). Starting from 1974, the \u201cMinistry of Automobile Road Construction and Maintenance\u201d and in 1989 Azerbaijan Automobile Road Production Association were accountable for road infrastructure. \u201cAzeravtoyol\u201d Production Association and after \u201cAzeravtoyol\u201d Public Company were the first organizations established after Azerbaijan gained its independence in 1990s.
