    "text": "Jan Bara\u015b-Komski (February 3, 1915, Bircza, Przemy\u015bl County, Poland \u2013 July 20, 2002, Arlington County, Virginia) was a Polish painter. He studied painting, anatomy, and art history at the Krak\u00f3w Academy of Fine Arts. During World War II, he worked in the resistance movement. In 1940 he fled Poland and headed toward France to join Sikorski's Army that was being formed there. However, he was arrested at the border of Czechoslovakia and imprisoned in Nowy S\u0105cz and Tarn\u00f3w before being sent to Auschwitz I in the first prisoner transport to that concentration camp. He was given prisoner number 564 under the name Jon Bara\u015b, due to the forged identification papers he was carrying when arrested. On December 29, 1942, he escaped Auschwitz I with three other prisoners: Mieczys\u0142aw Januszewski, Boles\u0142aw Kuczbara, and Otto K\u00fcsel. Sixteen days later he was recaptured on a train heading toward Warsaw. He had used a false name in his first arrest, as the Germans would have executed him on the spot had they known he was an Auschwitz escapee. He was sent to Montelupich Prison and from there back to Auschwitz II where he was given the prisoner number 152,884. During the last few years of World War II he was moved to Buchenwald, then to Gross-Rosen, Hersbruck and finally Dachau where he was liberated on April 29, 1945 by the United States Army. After the war, he lived in Displaced Persons camps in Bavaria and Munich, where he married another Auschwitz survivor. They moved to the United States in 1949. In the U.S., he worked as a graphic artist with The Washington Post. Over the years, he created many drawings and paintings of life in a concentration camp. He was featured alongside fellow concentration camp survivors and artists Dinah Gottliebova and Felix Nussbaum in the 1999 documentary film Eyewitness, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject. ==References== ==External links== *Jan Komski's artwork *Jan Komski's Story Category:1915 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Bircza Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Disease-related deaths in Virginia Category:Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts alumni Category:Auschwitz concentration camp survivors Category:Escapees from Auschwitz Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:Gross- Rosen concentration camp survivors Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp survivors Category:Polish male painters ",
