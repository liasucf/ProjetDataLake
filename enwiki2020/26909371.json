The institution became respected and appreciated by the professional market. In the year 2000, ETEFSP was transformed into Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica (CEFET) (S\u00e3o Paulo Federal Center of Technological Education), there was a remodel and expansion of the institution's offerings related to education. More career options, campus and structural and technological improvements. In 2005 was created the Campus of Guarulhos, 2006 Campus Caraguatatuba and Campus S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Boa Vista, 2007 Campus Salto and Campus Bragan\u00e7a Paulista and in 2008 Campus S\u00e3o Carlos and Campus S\u00e3o Roque. Another campi was created at many cities, and there is expectation for more expansion in future. In the year 2008 CEFET became the Instituto Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia de S\u00e3o Paulo (S\u00e3o Paulo Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology).
