It was founded in 1957 by Ray Stark, Eliot Hyman, and Norman Katz. == History == Seven Arts first film was The Gun Runners, released by United Artists. Among its productions were The Misfits (1961) for United Artists, Gigot (1962) for Twentieth Century-Fox, Lolita (1962) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) for Warner Bros., and Is Paris Burning? (1966) for Paramount Pictures. Over time it expanded its role, becoming equity investors with other studios and partnering with British horror film company Hammer Film Productions on many projects. It also retained ancillary rights on new productions surrendered on earlier films, including Seven Days in May (1964) and Promise Her Anything (1965) for release by Paramount. Seven Arts also distributed feature films and TV programs for television. Warner Bros. licensed the TV rights to its post-1949 library to Seven Arts in 1960. Seven Arts made similar deals with 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures. Seven Arts also acquired theatrical reissue rights to some Fox films as well. In 1967, Seven Arts Productions acquired the controlling interest in Warner Bros. Pictures from Jack L. Warner for $32 million. The companies were merged as Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. It was renamed Warner Bros. after Kinney National Company bought the company. == Other uses == Neither the later Seven Arts Pictures nor the defunct releasing company \"Seven Arts\", an early 1990s joint venture between Carolco Pictures and New Line Cinema (the latter which subsequently merged into Warner Bros.), is related to the original Seven Arts Productions. __NOTOC__ == Select filmography == * The Gun Runners (1958); with United Artists * Thunder in the Sun (1959); with Paramount Pictures * Ten Seconds to Hell (1959); with United Artists * The Misfits (1961); with United Artists * By Love Possessed (1961); with United Artists * West Side Story (1961); with United Artists * The Count of Monte Cristo (1961) * The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone (1961) * Gigot (1962); with Twentieth Century Fox * Lolita (1962); with MGM * What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
