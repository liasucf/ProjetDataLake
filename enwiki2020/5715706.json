    "text": "This is a list of silicon producers. The industry involves several very different stages of production. Production starts at silicon metal, which is the material used to gain high purity silicon. High purity silicon in different grades of purity is used for growing silicon ingots, which are sliced to wafers in a process called wafering. Compositionally pure polycrystalline silicon wafers are useful for photovoltaics. Dislocation-free and extremely flat single-crystal silicon wafers are required in the manufacture of computer chips. ==Silicon producers== * Elkem * JFE Steel * Mississippi Silicon * Nitol Solar * REC Silicon * SunEdison * Silicon Materials, Inc. * Alsilmaterial * JPM Silicon ==High-purity silicon== * Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) * Silfex INC * Silicio FerroSolar * SunEdison * Tokuyama Corporation * Wacker Chemie AG * Alsilmaterial * JPM Silicon ==Silicon wafer manufacturers== A partial list of major producers of wafers (made of high purity silicon, mono- or polycrystalline) includes: * Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation * LDK Solar * NexWafe * Okmetic * ReneSola * Renewable Energy Corporation * Shin-Etsu Handotai * Siltronic * Sil'Tronix Silicon Technologies Sil'Tronix Silicon Technologies * SUMCO * SunEdison * UniversityWafer, Inc. * Virginia Semiconductor Inc ==See also== * List of photovoltaics companies ==References== Category:Silicon * Silicon ",
