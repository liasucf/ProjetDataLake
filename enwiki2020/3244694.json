    "text": "Laryngeal consonants (a term often used interchangeably with guttural consonants) are consonants with their primary articulation in the larynx. The laryngeal consonants comprise the pharyngeal consonants (including the epiglottals), the glottal consonants,John Esling (2010) \"Phonetic Notation\", in Hardcastle, Laver & Gibbon (eds) The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences, 2nd ed.Note that Esling (2010) has abandoned epiglotto-pharyngeal as a distinct articulation. and for some languages uvular consonants.Scott Moisik, Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins, & John H. Esling (2012) \"The Epilaryngeal Articulator: A New Conceptual Tool for Understanding Lingual-Laryngeal Contrasts\" The term laryngeal is often taken to be synonymous with glottal, but the larynx consists of more than just the glottis (vocal folds): it also includes the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds. In a broad sense, therefore, laryngeal articulations include the radical consonants, which involve the root of the tongue. The diversity of sounds produced in the larynx is the subject of ongoing research, and the terminology is evolving. The term laryngeal consonant is also used for laryngealized consonants articulated in the upper vocal tract, such as Arabic 'emphatics' and Korean 'tense' consonants. ==See also== *Laryngeal theory (in Proto-Indo-European phonology) *Place of articulation *Index of phonetics articles ==References== * *Miller, Amanda (2005), \"Guttural vowels and guttural co-articulation in Ju|\u2019hoansi\".
