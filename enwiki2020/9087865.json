It was founded in 1922 and ever since then has been competing domestically in Kosovo. Throughout the years after World War II, Vu\u010ditrn became one of the most renowned football clubs in Kosovo due to producing some of Kosovos\u2019 best young talents. Many of these players were transferred to other Kosovar clubs such as Prishtina and Trep\u00e7a due to them playing in former Yugoslav First League. After the Kosovo War, the citizens & supporters returned to its stadium stands. Although numerously fighting relegation throughout the seasons during the 2000s one thing was for sure, the \u201cFerki Aliu Stadium\u201d would always be packed to the rafters during every home game. The clubs\u2019 ultras group \u201cForca\u201d gained a nation wide generalisation during that period due to many opposing teams supporters being the subject of verbal and physical abuse when they would travel and watch their team play in the city of Vushtrri. Due to this the club was constantly fined and deducted points and became one of Kosovos most hated teams and fiercest cities to play away at. In 2012 the club was purchased by local steel galvanising plant, Llamkos GalvaSteel.Kosova Football Club is officially owned by Llamkos GalvaSteel When the club was taken over by Llamkos GalvaSteel and the Core Group, there were immediate investments made which resulted in the club winning their 2013\u201314 league title, which was the first in its history. Llamkos GalvaSteel then distanced itself from the club as did the club's owner Jeton Sadiku, leaving the financing and management in the hands of the Vu\u010ditrn municipality.Kthehet Kosova e Vushtrris\u00eb!
