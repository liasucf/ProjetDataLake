In the Asia/Oceania Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams competed against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group I advanced to the World Group Qualifying Round, along with losing teams from the World Group first round. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group I, whereas teams who lost their play-offs were relegated to the Asia/Oceania Zone Group II in 2000. ==Participating nations== * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===South Korea vs. India=== ===China vs. New Zealand=== ===Uzbekistan vs. Pakistan=== ===Lebanon vs. Japan=== ==Second round== ===New Zealand vs. South Korea=== ===Japan vs. Uzbekistan=== ==First round relegation play-offs== ===India vs. China=== ===Lebanon vs. Pakistan=== ==Second round relegation play-offs== ===China vs. Pakistan=== ==References== ==External links== *Davis Cup official website Category:Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ",
