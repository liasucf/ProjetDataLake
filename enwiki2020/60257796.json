The projected cost of this project is \u20ac10 billion.\u2018Egnatia Railway\u2019 European Commission ==Background== The Egnatia Railway consists of multiple smaller scale projects: *the line from Alexandroupolis to Thessaloniki: electrification and installation of advanced signaling and telecommunication systems, wherever necessary, and new routing in selected subsections. This includes a section of new track from Xanthi to Thessaloniki via Kavala (projected to cost \u20ac1.25 billion), which will shorten the journey between the two by three hours.https://ypodomes.com/railway- egnatia-the-anatomy-of-the-emerging-rail-backbone-of-greece/ *Thessaloniki- Kozani: electrification and signaling, *Kozani-Krystallopigi: electrification and signaling, construction of new line for the subsection Florina\u2013Krystallopigi, *Kozani-Igoumenitsa: new line construction via Ioannina to connect with Igoumenitsa Port. ==Planning== In 2019, Hellenic Railways Organisation awarded the contract to build the initial section between Xanthi and Kavala at a cost of \u20ac250 million. ==Costs== The cost is estimated at EUR 10bn but the final cost will be determined when studies completed. The project cost break down: *Thessaloniki-Alexandroupolis: \u20ac1,8bn (Section Alexandroupolis \u2013 Xanthi, \u20ac300m, Section Xanthi \u2013 Kavala \u2013 Thessaloniki, \u20ac1,5bn) *Thessaloniki-Kozani: \u20ac800m *Kozani-Igoumenitsa (incl. c) Kozani - Krystallopigi - Florina): \u20ac7,4bn The proposed business model is that of a PPP. The construction and operation of the project will be undertaken by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). Sources of revenues include rail exploitation and logistics services revenues. The funding will be from the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), and probably from EIB and EU programmes. ==Other projects== A link from Krystallopigi into Albania is also proposed. ==See also== *P.A.Th.E./P. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Greece Category:Standard gauge railways in Greece ",
