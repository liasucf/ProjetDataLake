    "text": "The Coo Coo Bird is the 24th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on June 9, 1947, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Woody decides to go to bed early so he can get a head start on quail season the next morning. However, circumstances conspire to keep him awake: first a bright flashing sign on a nearby building, then a loudly ticking cuckoo clock, and finally an insubordinate folding table that he tries (and fails) to use as a bed after inadvertently destroying his own. Acting like a bucking bronco, the table eventually throws him out the window and into a bush; three quails, in turn, toss him out into the open, where he literally gets mixed up with a hunter's dogs. == References == *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1947\".
