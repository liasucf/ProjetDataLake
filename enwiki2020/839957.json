    "text": "Carl Johan Arthur Bernadotte, Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg, (31 October 1916 \u2013 5 May 2012) was the fourth son and fifth and youngest child of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and his first wife Princess Margaret of Connaught. He was born a Prince of Sweden and granted the title of Duke of Dalarna but renounced these titles to marry a commoner. He was a paternal uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and a maternal uncle of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. ==Marriages and children== Bernadotte lost his succession rights to the Swedish throne and renounced his titles in 1946 when he married the journalist Elin Kerstin Margaretha Wijkmark (4 October 1910 \u2013 11 September 1987), daughter of Henning Wijkmark and wife Elin Larsson in New York City on 19 February. As his unconstitutional marriage to Wijkmark - enskild mans dotter (daughter of a common man) - could not be approved by the Swedish government, Bernadotte knew he was giving up his Swedish titles and succession rights. They adopted two children: * Monica Kristina Margaretha Bernadotte (born 5 March 1948, adopted in 1951). Married on 16 January 1976 and divorced in 1997 Count Johan Peder Bonde af Bj\u00f6rn\u00f6 (born 5 May 1950). They have three children. * Christian Carl Henning Bernadotte (born 3 December 1949, adopted in 1950). Married on 13 September 1980 Marianne Jenny (born 31 January 1958), daughter of Jacques Jenny and wife Caroline Yvonne Venter. They have three children. The Bernadottes lived for some time in New York City, where he worked as the representative of the Anglo-Nordic Trading Company. They made friends with the film star Greta Garbo, who stayed with them in their Swedish home near B\u00e5stad. On 29 September 1988, the widowed Bernadotte married Countess Gunnila M\u00e4rtha Louise (Wachtmeister af Johannishus) Bussler (12 May 1923 - 12 September 2016) in Copenhagen and also became the stepfather of her three children from her previous marriage. ==Titles, styles, honours and arms== Royal Cemetery north of Stockholm. *31 October 1916 \u2013 19 February 1946: His Royal Highness Prince Carl Johan of Sweden, Duke of Dalarna *19 February 1946 \u2013 2 July 1951: Carl Johan Bernadotte *2 July 1951 \u2013 5 May 2012: Carl Johan Arthur Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg When marrying morganatically on 19 February 1946 he lost his Swedish royal titles, i.e. Prince of Sweden and Duke of Dalarna.
