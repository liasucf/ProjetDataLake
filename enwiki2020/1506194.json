    "text": "The Steropodontidae was a possible family of monotremes that are known from fossils from the Cretaceous of Australia. There are two genera placed in this family: Steropodon and Teinolophos, which have been tentatively placed in the family due to the similarity of the lower molars in these two genera. However, the latter may be more basal.Thomas H. Rich, James A. Hopson, Pamela G. Gill, Peter Trusler, Sally Rogers-Davidson, Steve Morton, Richard L.
