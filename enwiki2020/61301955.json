    "text": "Balasiong (also spelled balacion, baliciong, or balisiong) is a Filipino sword used by Muslim Filipino ethnolinguistic groups (the Moro people) in the Southern Philippines. It is a type of kalis but differs in that the double- edged blade isn't wavy but instead slightly convex. It also tapers sharply to the tip. The hilt, like in the kalis is shaped like a pistol handle, an element known as the kakatua (cockatoo). == See also == *Kalis *Punyal *Kampilan *Panabas ==References== Category:Blade weapons Category:Philippine culture Category:Filipino swords ",
