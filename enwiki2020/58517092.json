    "text": "The \u00c9cole nationale de chimie physique et biologie de Paris (ENCPB), renamed in 2009 \"lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Gilles-de-Gennes - ENCPB\" after physician Pierre-Gilles de Gennes died in 2007, is a public secondary and higher school specialising in technical and scientific subjects and preparatory classes to the grandes \u00e9coles (CPGE). It is located at 11 rue Pirandello in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. == History and courses == Distant view of the main building from rue Claude-Bernard. With a desire to create a public institution for the training of lab technicians at baccalaur\u00e9at level and higher technicians following the growth in sciences in the post-war period, the stated created the ENCPB in 1953. The school took its first 50 students in 1955 at a site on rue Corvisart in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. The first move for the school was to rue du Banquier in 1958. From 1961 to 1971, the ENCPB joined with a number of technician training institutions, including the Institut d'Arsonval (8, rue Rollin in Paris 5th), the research centre for l'Or\u00e9al (Avenue Gabriel P\u00e9ri at La Courneuve) and a school in Dijon. With the construction from 1970 to 1973 of a new location on rue Pirandello on the former site of the Delahaye automobiles factory (1898\u20131954), the ENCPB diversified its courses with the creation of classes pr\u00e9paratoires aux grandes \u00e9coles in the sections of MP, PC, BCPST and TB. === Lyc\u00e9e rankings === In 2016, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 81st out of 110 at d\u00e9partemental level in terms of teaching quality, and 1205th at national level. The ranking is based on three criteria: the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur\u00e9at after spending their last two years at the establishment, and the added value (calculated based on the social origin of the students, their age, and their national diploma results). === CPGE rankings === The national rankings for preparatory classes to the grandes \u00e9coles (CPGE) are the admission rates for students to the most reputable French grandes \u00e9coles. In 2015, the magazine L'\u00c9tudiant gave the following rankings for 2014 : {| class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text- align:right\" ! Stream ! Students admitted to a grande \u00e9cole* !

In the scientific stream, this was a group of 11-17 engineering schools which were selected by L'\u00c9tudiant for the streams (MP, PC, PSI, PT or BCPST). |} In 1984, the ENCPB adopted the reforms to higher education, and offered a national diploma of Brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur (BTS), creating sections for: *Chemtry *Physics *Medical biology analysis (formerly BTS biological analysis) *Bioanalysis and control (formerly BTS Biochemistry before 2005) *Biotechnology *Quality in the food and bio- industries *Water studies The also offered technological baccalaur\u00e9ats (as they are now known): *STL physics *STL chemistry *STL control regulation *STL biochemistry and biological engineering They also offered post-BTS courses from 1984 to 2007, which became \"professional licences\": *Functional genomics *Biomedical instrumentation and maintenance *Hospital hygience (training for biohygienists) *Double competence in chemistry regulation *Organic synthesis *Formulation *Medical imaging and therapeutic radiology was added to the existing BTS, before in 2012, with health reforms, becoming a diploma at bac+3 The ENCPB have developed partnerships with the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan and the Universit\u00e9 Paris VII allowing students to study at these institutions, but also with a training centre for technical teachers for the Kingdom of Morocco in chemical engineering. The ENCPB actively takes part in European programmes (Erasmus, Comett...). After the death in 2007 of physician Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Nobel Prize laureate, the ENCPB was renamed \"lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Gilles-de-Gennes - ENCPB\" after him, and became a general and technological lyc\u00e9e with the development of a general S (SVT and SI) stream parallel to the lab technology stream. == Distribution == Currently, the ENCPB has 1920 students in four study cycles: * 31 in general scientific and technological baccalaur\u00e9ats * 20% in preparatory classes for grandes \u00e9coles * 45% in BTS * 4% in post-BTS == Filming location == During the construction of the new ENCPB building, the filming of Juliette et Juliette (released in 1974) took place on site. This was particularly due to the proximity of two caf\u00e9s, located face to face on the corner of a block. This configuration exactly met the needs of the film (one of the caf\u00e9s was turned into a restaurant during the filming). More recently, the entrance to the ENCPB was used for the d\u00e9cor of the film Cach\u00e9 (2005) by Michael Haneke, particularly in the final scene, where the key to understanding the film takes place. In 2010, the school was used for scenes in the telefilm Obsessions by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tellier where the laboratories stand in for \"Laboratoire de la police scientifique\". == Alumni == * Didier Baich\u00e8re == Access == The ENCPB is served by the Metro lines 5 at the station Campo-Formio and 7 at the station Les Gobelins, as well as the Bus (RATP) lines: * stop Banquier * stop Jenner - Jeanne d'Arc * stop Saint-Marcel - Jeanne d'Arc == Notes and references == == External links == * Category:Lyc\u00e9es in Paris Category:13th arrondissement of Paris ",
