    "text": "I'm Alive is the tenth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1993 (see 1993 in music). The title track, \"I'm Alive\", reached 18 on the Album Rock Tracks chart and No. 28 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles released from the album were \"Everywhere I Go\" (UK No. 67UK Chart info ) and \"Sky Blue and Black\". ==History== After veering heavily towards songs of a political nature on his two previous albums, longtime fans of Browne welcomed the return on I'm Alive to his previous style of songwriting. The song \"Too Many Angels\" includes backing vocals by Jennifer Warnes, Valerie Carter, Doug Haywood, Katia Cardinal and Ryan Browne while the song \"All Good Things\" includes backing vocals by David Crosby and Don Henley. The song \"Sky Blue and Black\" was also featured in the pilot episode of American situation comedy Friends. In an interview on Off Camera with Sam Jones, Jackson Browne stated that the song \"I'll Do Anything\" was originally written to be the title song for the James L. Brooks movie of the same name. It was to be a comedic song sung by Albert Brooks where he is begging a test audience to favorably review his latest film. The album was certified as a gold record in 1995 by the RIAA.RIAA Gold and Platinum award. Retrieved July 20, 2010 ==Reception== I'm Alive was considered somewhat of a comeback for Browne. Stephen Holden writing for The New York Times wrote \"I'm Alive is a striking return to the kind of romantic subject matter that the Los Angeles singer and songwriter seemed to have abandoned after 1980 in favor of political songwriting. His finest album in nearly two decades, it has much in common with his 1974 masterpiece, Late For The Sky, whose songs also described the disintegration of a relationship.\" Critic William Ruhlman agreed though did not consider the album as strong. \"Longtime fans welcomed the album as a return in style... Browne eschewed the greater philosophical implications of romance and, falling back on stock imagery (angels, rain), failed to achieve an originality of expression. While it was good news that he wasn't tilting at windmills anymore, Browne did not make a full comeback with the album, despite a couple of well-constructed songs.\" The Rolling Stone Record Guide wrote Browne \"returned to his forte: the personal joy and agony of day-to-day human interaction.\" In the original Rolling Stone review for the album from 1993, Kara Manning expressed the belief that \"Browne has successfully managed to resurrect his persona of 20 years ago. I'm Alive shudders with the pain of someone who's been soundly dumped. And Browne has even gained a sense of gallows humor. Between despondent cries for reconciliation, the singer indulges in refreshingly silly self-deprecation.\" However, she wondered, \"what does a younger, angrier generation \u2013 raging to Dr. Dre and Nirvana \u2013 make of all this? But '70s nostalgia is on a roll...\" The album was in Q's list of \"The 50 Best Albums Of 1993\". It was voted number 456 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Jackson Browne. #\"I'm Alive\" \u2013 5:01 #\"My Problem Is You\" \u2013 4:40 #\"Everywhere I Go\" \u2013 4:36 #\"I'll Do Anything\" \u2013 4:31 #\"Miles Away\" \u2013 3:52 #\"Too Many Angels\" \u2013 6:04 #\"Take This Rain\" \u2013 4:49 #\"Two of Me, Two of You\" \u2013 2:56 #\"Sky Blue and Black\" \u2013 6:06 #\"All Good Things\" \u2013 4:28 ==Personnel== * Jackson Browne \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (1, 5, 6, 10), piano (2, 4, 7, 9, 10), guitar (3), backing vocals (6) * Sweet Pea Atkinson \u2013 backing vocals (2) * Sir Harry Bowens \u2013 backing vocals (2) * Ryan Browne \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Mike Campbell \u2013 guitar (5, 7, 10) * Katia Cardenal \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Valerie Carter \u2013 backing vocals (4, 6, 9) * Lenny Castro \u2013 percussion (2, 6) * Luis Conte \u2013 percussion (1\u20135, 7\u201310) * David Crosby \u2013 backing vocals (10) * Mark Goldenberg \u2013 guitar (1, 9) * William \"Bill\" Greene \u2013 backing vocals (2) * Doug Haywood \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Don Henley \u2013 backing vocals (10) * James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson \u2013 bass guitar (2, 6) * Jim Keltner \u2013 drums (2, 6) * John Leventhal \u2013 guitar (2, 4), acoustic guitar (8) * Mauricio-Fritz Lewak \u2013 drums (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), additional drums (6) * David Lindley \u2013 guitar (2), bouzouki (6), oud (6) * Kevin McCormick \u2013 bass guitar (1, 3, 4, 5, 7\u201310) * Arnold McCuller \u2013 backing vocals (2, 4, 9) * Dean Parks \u2013 acoustic guitar (2) * Steven Soles \u2013 backing vocals (7) * Benmont Tench \u2013 Hammond organ (1, 2, 5\u20138, 10) * Scott Thurston \u2013 guitar (1, 5, 9), backing vocals (1, 3, 5, 7), keyboards (3, 4, 6, 9, 10) * Waddy Wachtel \u2013 guitar (3, 7) * Jennifer Warnes \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Jai Winding \u2013 piano (8) ==Production== * Producers \u2013 Jackson Browne and Scott Thurston (Tracks 1, 3, 4, 5 & 7\u201310); Don Was (Tracks 2 & 6). * Assistant Producer \u2013 Susann McMahon * Engineers \u2013 Paul Dieter (Tracks 1, 3, 4, 5 & 7\u201310); Rik Pekkonen (Tracks 2 & 6). * Assistant Engineers \u2013 Steve Onuska, Bob Salcedo and Kathy Yore. * Mixed by Ed Cherney * Recorded and Mixed at Groove Masters (Santa Monica, CA). * Mastered by Gavin Lurssen and Doug Sax at The Mastering Lab (Los Angeles, CA). * Technical Engineer \u2013 Ed Wong, assisted by Bill Irvin. * Piano Technician \u2013 Edd Kolakowski * Art Direction \u2013 Robin Lynch * Design \u2013 Robin Lynch and Alli Truch * Photography \u2013 Bruce Weber * Management \u2013 Donald Miller * Management Staff \u2013 Veronica Albano, Michael Sexton, Donald Warnes and Randall Wixen. ==Charts== Album \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1993 |align=\"left\"|The Billboard 200 |align=\"left\"|40 |- |} Singles \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Single !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1993 |align=\"left\"|\"I'm Alive\" |align=\"left\"|Bubbling Under the Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|18 |- |align=\"left\"|1993 |align=\"left\"|\"I'm Alive\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks |align=\"left\"|18 |- |align=\"left\"|1993 |align=\"left\"|\"I'm Alive\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |align=\"left\"|28 |- |align=\"left\"|1994 |align=\"left\"|\"Everywhere I Go\" |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart |align=\"left\"|67 |} ==References== Category:Jackson Browne albums Category:1993 albums Category:Albums produced by Don Was Category:Elektra Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Groove Masters Studios ",
