Buckler drew virtually every major character at Marvel and DC, often as a cover artist. ==Career== As a teenager in Detroit, Buckler attended the initial iterations of the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, eventually running the convention along with originator Robert Brosch in 1969\u20131970. Buckler's first comics work was as a teenager with the four-page historical story \"Freedom Fighters: Washington Attacks Trenton\" in the King Features comic book Flash Gordon #10 (cover-dated Nov. 1967). In 1971, he did some work for Skywald Publications but made a \"wrong move\" by attempting to date the daughter of Skywald's co-owner Israel Waldman.Buckler in Cooke, p. 72: \"I was told that I'm not Jewish enough - understandable since I'm not Jewish (I'm a mixture of German, Irish, and French - but I look mostly German). Anyway, I'm married to a Jewish girl now.\" At DC Comics, he drew the \"Rose and the Thorn\" backup stories in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #117\u2013121 (Dec. 1971\u2013April 1972). Buckler drew the first three issues of writer Don McGregor's Black Panther series in Jungle Action vol. 2, #6\u20138 (Sept. 1973\u2013Jan. 1974), a run that Comics Bulletin in 2010 ranked third on its list of the \"Top 10 1970s Marvels\". He fulfilled a decade-long dream in 1974 when assigned to draw Marvel's flagship series, Fantastic Four, on which he stayed for two years.Thomas, Roy. \"Bullpen Bulletins,\" Marvel comics cover-dated January 1974. During this period, Buckler created the cyborg antihero Deathlok, who starred in an ongoing feature debuting in Astonishing Tales #25 (Aug. 1974). Also during this period, Buckler hired the young George P\u00e9rez as his studio assistant. Buckler collaborated with writer Gerry Conway on a \"Superman vs. Shazam!\" story published in All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 (April 1978).All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 at the Grand Comics Database He drew the newspaper comic strip The Incredible Hulk for approximately six months in 1979. A Justice League story by Conway and Buckler originally intended for All-New Collectors' Edition saw print in Justice League of America #210\u2013212 (Jan.\u2013March 1983).Justice League of America #210 at the Grand Comics Database Buckler and Roy Thomas then created the World War II superhero team the All- Star Squadron in a special insert in Justice League of America #193 (Aug. 1981) which led to the team's own title the following month. In 1983,The Comics Journal accused Buckler of plagiarism, saying that he had a reputation as a \"swipe\" artist who copied poses and layouts from previous artists' work. Buckler sued the magazine for libel, but later dropped the suit. Buckler worked for Archie Comics in 1983 and 1984, when that publisher briefly revived its Red Circle Comics superhero line, and he recruited Cary Burkett to write the Mighty Crusaders title. In 1985, Buckler returned to Marvel and briefly drew The Spectacular Spider-Man with writer Peter David, where they produced the storyline \"The Death of Jean DeWolff\". He also served as editor for a short-lived line of comics by Solson Publications, where in 1987 he created Reagan's Raiders.Reagan's Raiders at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on December 21, 2016. In 2011, Buckler drew a Djustine short story written by Enrico Teodorani for the Italian market. He was the author of three books on comic book artistry: How to Become a Comic Book Artist and How to Draw Superheroes (Solson Publications) in 1986, and How to Draw Dynamic Comic Books (Vanguard Publications) in 2007. In 2015, he became an Inkwell Awards Ambassador. It was not uncommon for him to use the alias Ron Validar or simply Validar for his Marvel comics work when he was on exclusive contract with rival DC. In this way he was able to skirt the spirit of the law if not the letter. His most prominent covers using this nome de plume were often inked by Ernie Chan.http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=3900 ==Death== Buckler died May 19, 2017 after a long battle with cancer. ==Bibliography== === Arcana Studio === * Shadowflame #3 (inker) (2007) ===Archie Comics=== *Blue Ribbon Comics #4 (artist with Trevor von Eden, writer with Stan Timmons), #6\u20137, 11 (writer with Stan Timmons) (1983\u201384) *Fly #1\u20132, 4 (1983) *Lancelot Strong, The Shield #1 (writer) (1983) *Mighty Crusaders #1\u20138 (penciller), #9\u201310 (inker) (1983\u201384) === Astral Comics === * Astral Comics #1 (1977) * Galaxia Magazine #1 (1981) ===Atlas/Seaboard Comics=== *The Demon Hunter #1 (1975) *Tales of Evil #3 (1975) *Weird Suspense #3 (with Pat Boyette) (1975) ===Continuity Comics=== *Hybrids: The Origin #3\u20134 (1993) ===DC Comics=== *Action Comics (Atom) #447 (1975) *All-New Collectors' Edition (Superman vs. Shazam!) #C\u201358 (1978) *All-Star Squadron #1\u20135, 36 (full art); Annual #3 (among other artists) (1981\u201384) *America vs. the Justice Society, miniseries, #1 (among other artists) (1985) *Batman #265, 267, 329; (Robin) #239\u2013242 (1972\u201380) *DC Comics Presents #12, 33\u201334, 45, 49, Annual #1 (1979\u201382) *DC Retroactive: Wonder Woman \u2013 The '80s #1 (2011) *DC Special (Captain Comet) #27 (1977) *DC Super Stars (Gorilla Grodd) #14 (1977) *Detective Comics (Hawkman) #434, 446, 479 (1973\u201378) *The Flash #271\u2013272 (1979) *Hardware #10, 12 (1993\u201394) *House of Mystery #199, 258 (1972\u201378) *House of Secrets #90 (1971) *Jonah Hex #11 (1978) *Justice League of America #188\u2013191, 193, 210\u2013212 (1981\u201383) *Kobra #5 (1976) *The New Adventures of Superboy #9 (1980) *New Gods #15 (1977) *Omega Men #34 (1986) *Secret Origin of Superman (Leaf Comic Book Candy) (1980) *Secrets of Sinister House #10 (inker) (1973) *Secret Society of Super Villains #5\u20139 (1977) *Star Hunters #4\u20137 (1978) *Superman (Fabulous World of Krypton) #246, 251, 352 (1971\u20131980); (Bruce Superman Wayne) #363 (1981); (Superman) #364, 369 (1981\u201382) *Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane (Rose and Thorn) #117\u2013121 (1971\u201372) *Tales of the Teen Titans #51\u201354 (1985) *Time Warp #1 (1979) *The Unexpected #123, 126, 135, 157, 174 (1971\u201376) *The Warlord #87\u201388 (inker), #89\u201390, 97 (1985) *Weird War Tales #23, 123 (1974\u201383) *Weird Western Tales (Jonah Hex) #37 (1976) *Wonder Woman #300 (among other artists) (1983) *World's Finest Comics (Hawkman) #257\u2013258; (Superman and Batman) #259\u2013261, 263\u2013264, 266\u2013267, 269\u2013272, 275\u2013276, 278, 280, 285\u2013286 (1979\u201382) === Deluxe Comics === * Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R.
