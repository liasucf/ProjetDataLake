    "text": "Popol Vuh were a German musical collective founded by keyboardist Florian Fricke in 1969 together with Frank Fiedler (sound design, fine cut), Holger Tr\u00fclzsch (percussion), and Bettina Fricke (tablas and production).Popol Vuh Biography, Booklet to CD issue of \"Popol Vuh Revisted & Remixed, 1970-1999\", SPV recordings, 2011 Other important members during the next two decades included Djong Yun, Renate Knaup, Conny Veit, Daniel Fichelscher, Klaus Wiese, and Robert Eliscu.Michael Fuchs-Gambock, Gerhard Augustin: Booklet to CD re- issue of \"Hosianna Mantra\", SPV recordings, 2004 The band took its name from the Mayan manuscript containing the mythology of the K'iche' people people of highland Guatemala; the name has been translated roughly as \"meeting place\" or \"book of the community\".Link text, additional text. Popol Vuh began as an electronic music project, but under Fricke's leadership they soon abandoned synthesizers for organic instrumentation and world music influences. They developed a productive working partnership with director Werner Herzog, contributing scores to films such as Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), and Fitzcarraldo (1982). The group are associated with West Germany's 1970s krautrock movement and are considered progenitors of ambient music. Today, Popol Vuh's best-reviewed works are In den G\u00e4rten Pharaos (1971) and Hosianna Mantra (1972). ==History== The first album, Affenstunde, released in 1970, can be regarded as one of the earliest space music works, featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer together with ethnic percussion. This continued for only one more album, In den G\u00e4rten Pharaos, and material later to be released on the soundtrack to Aguirre, the Wrath of God, before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favour of piano-led compositions from 1972's Hosianna Mantra forward. This album also marked the start of exploring overtly religious themes rather than a more generally spiritual feeling within the music. The group evolved to include a range of instruments: wind and strings, electric and acoustic alike, combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective. Popol Vuh influenced many other European bands with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentation, which took inspiration from the music of Tibet, Africa, and pre-Columbian America. With music sometimes described as \"ethereal\", they created soundscapes through psychedelic walls of sound, and are regarded as precursors of contemporary world music, as well as of new age and ambient. The band contributed soundtracks to the films of Werner Herzog, including the aforementioned Aguirre, the Wrath of God, as well as Nosferatu, Fitzcarraldo, Cobra Verde, Heart of Glass and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, in which Fricke appeared. Florian Fricke died in Munich on 29 December 2001 and the group disbanded. In October 2003 Klaus Schulze wrote: :\"Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music. He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music, but soon discovered that he didn't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead. Here, he went on to create a new world, which Werner Herzog loves so much, transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music.\"Klaus Schulze, Oldau, October 7, 2003: Booklet to CD re-issue of \"Hosianna Mantra\", SPV recordings, 2004 ==Discography== *Affenstunde (1970) *In den G\u00e4rten Pharaos (1971) *Hosianna Mantra (1972) *Seligpreisung (1973) *Einsj\u00e4ger und Siebenj\u00e4ger (1974) *Das Hohelied Salomos (1975) *Aguirre (1975) *Letzte Tage \u2013 Letzte N\u00e4chte (1976) *Herz aus Glas (1977) *Br\u00fcder des Schattens \u2013 S\u00f6hne des Lichts (1978) *Nosferatu (1978) *Die Nacht der Seele (1979) *Sei still, wisse ICH BIN (1981) *Agape \u2013 Agape (1983) *Spirit of Peace (1985) *Cobra Verde (1987) *For You and Me (1991) *Sing, for Song Drives Away the Wolves (1993) *City Raga (1995) *Shepherd's Symphony \u2013 Hirtensymphonie (1997) *Messa di Orfeo (1999) ===Florian Fricke solo albums=== *Die Erde und ich sind Eins (1983) \u2013 limited private pressing *Florian Fricke Plays Mozart (1992) \u2013 featuring Fricke on piano playing Mozart compositions ===Compilations=== Note: there are two distinct issues of the compilation Best of Popol Vuh \u2013 Werner Herzog.
