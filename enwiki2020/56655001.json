It is the seat of government of the City of Malaybalay since the City Hall is located here. Situated in the South Highway District of Malaybalay, Casisang borders on the north with the Poblacion barangays of Barangay 11, Barangay 7, and Barangay 9, on the east with Can-ayan, on the south with San Jose, Magsaysay, and Mapayag, and on the West by Imbayao and Kalasungay. According to 2015 census Casisang has a population of 25,696 people. == History == Under Spanish rule, Barangay Casisang was part of the Barangay Poblaci\u00f3n of Malaybalay. Leaders of Malaybalay extend services to Casisang like in the person of Mr. Esteban Tilanduc\u00e2 who was delegated as capit\u00e1n of Malaybalay. He was the mediator between the people and the government. People turn to him for their financial and economic problems. He owned a vast land in the barangay and hired people to work in his farm. Tilanduc\u00e2 was considered as one of the original settlers of Barangay Casisang. Despite the organization of the community, the natives nonetheless preferred to stay in the forest in fear or dissatisfaction toward Spanish administration. Only when the Americans came, the people eventually learned to settle in the plains. They began to organize communities under a Dat\u00f9 designated as tribal leader. Schools were established which contributed to the economic growth of the community and the life of the people. Barangay Casisang was separated from Poblacion, Malaybalay and became a regular barangay in February 07, 1961,Malaybalay Resolution No. 14 s. 1961 under Resolution # 14-Series of 1961. == Geography == Casisang is situated in a gently sloping area and in the west it is gradually rising as it touches the foothills of Mt. Kitanglad Range. On the east, the Sawaga River cuts Casisang from its component Sitio Natid-asan where hills make a boundary with Barangay Can-ayan. The Mamal\u00e1 Creek separates Casisang from Impalambong, Kalasungay, and Imbayao. The Kalawaig Creek, on the other hand, separates Casisang and Barangay 9.
