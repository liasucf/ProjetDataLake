    "text": "Anthony Jackson (June 23, 1952) is an American bassist known for his many session recordings, live performances, and his role in developing a new design of the six-string bass guitar, which he called a contrabass guitar. He has been described as \u201cone of the masters of the instrument\u201d. ==Biography== Jackson touring the Netherlands with Al Di Meola in 1978 Jackson played piano before starting guitar in his teens. When he turned to bass guitar, he was inspired by James Jamerson and Jack Casady.Bass Player magazine, Spring 1990 issue, USA Jackson worked as a session musician, in the Billy Paul band, and with Philadelphia International Records. Paul\u2019s 1972 hit \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" was Jackson\u2019s first No. 1 record. His performance on \"For the Love of Money\" by The O'Jays helped move the song to No. 9 on the pop chart and No. 3 on the R&B; chart in 1974. Jackson is a student of Jerry Fisher, Lawrence Lucie, and Pat Martino. He has performed live in more than 30 countries and has recorded in more than 3000 sessions on more than 500 albums.The liner notes from album \"INTERSPIRIT\" 2010, Abstract Logix, LBLX020 In 2016 Jackson had to miss some performances with Hiromi, due to ill health. ==Six-string contrabass guitar== Danelectro (1956), Fender (1961) and other manufacturers had produced six- string basses tuned one octave below a guitar (EADGBE), and Jackson had briefly played a Fender five-string bass tuned EADGC. Jackson first approached various luthiers in 1974 about the construction of his idea for a \u201ccontrabass guitar\u201d tuned in fourths BEADGC, and Carl Thompson built the first six-string for Jackson in 1975. He first performed on the Thompson-built bass in 1975, recording with Carlos Garnett and touring with Roberta Flack. He later approached luthier Ken Smith to build him a six string bass before finally playing instruments made by New York-based bass makers, Fodera. Jackson said that the idea for adding more strings to the bass guitar came from his frustration with its limited range. When asked what he thought of criticism of the six-string bass, Jackson replied, > Why is four [strings] the standard and not six? As the lowest-pitched member > of the guitar family, the instrument should have had six strings from the > beginning. The only reason it had four was because Leo Fender was thinking > in application terms of an upright bass, but he built it along guitar lines > because that was his training. The logical conception for the bass guitar > encompasses six strings. From 1982 onwards Jackson exclusively played a contrabass. Prior to 1982 his main instruments included a 1973 Fender Precision Bass, a 1973 Fender Jazz bass fitted with a 1975 Precision neck, and a Gibson EB-2D bass. In 1984 Fodera introduced their first Anthony Jackson Signature Model contrabass, followed in 1989 with a single cutaway model, the \u201cAnthony Jackson Presentation Contrabass Guitar\u201d. ==Discography== ===As co-leader=== * Easy Pieces by Easy Pieces (Steve Ferrone, Renee Geyer, Anthony Jackson, Hamish Stuart) (A&M;, 1988) * Trio in Tokyo with Michel Petrucciani, Steve Gadd (Dreyfus, 1999) * Interspirit with Yiorgos Fakanas (Abstract Logix, 2010) ===As studio musician or guest=== With Patti Austin * Havana Candy (CTI, 1977) * Every Home Should Have One (Qwest, 1981) * In My Life (CTI, 1983) With Alex Bugnon * This Time Around (Epic, 1993) * Tales from the Bright Side (RCA, 1995) * As Promised (Narada, 2000) With Michel Camilo * Why Not?
