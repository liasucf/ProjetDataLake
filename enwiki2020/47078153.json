As per the tradition of this religious place any person who want to be its follower is supposed to declare himself died. It is done through digging his own pit grave and lye for one day in it. He himself has to perform his last rites. After that he will declare himself as dead and will be accepted as disciple of the Dera. Then he will disown all property and worldly means, in his name. The accepted disciple has to prepare his own garment to wear made of sack and eat staple food which he himself has to prepare from the waste food collected from Gurdwaras, dry it and eat for coming months. The time is spent in helping the poor and ill people of nearby villages and doing meditation. Kirtan is recited inside the place continuously as per Sikh tradition. ==References== == External links == *Location of the Market place of deadCategory:Rupnagar district ",
