The foundation's building was completed in 1906, had 100 beds, and was affiliated with Rush Medical College. It later developed into the Whyler Children's Hospital, which was opened in 1967. In 1989 the organization ceased its involvement in direct health provision, and became a foundation. Today, the foundation helps to fund the Norwegian American Hospital Pediatric Care-A- Van. ==References== Category:Medical and health foundations in the United States Category:Charities based in Illinois Category:Children's charities based in the United States Category:1892 establishments in the United States ",
