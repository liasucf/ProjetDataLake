He was a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1926 to 1927 and from 1932 to 1961. Norton was born in Dublin in 1900. He joined the postal service in 1916. By 1920, he was a prominent member of the Irish Postal Union and the wider trade union movement in Ireland. From 1924 to 1957, he served as Secretary of the Post Office Workers' Union. He was elected as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Dublin County at a by-election in 1926, but was defeated at the June 1927 general election. On constitutional matters, Norton opposed the introduction into force of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 which continued a role for the British King after the King was removed from the Constitution of Ireland. In Norton\u2019s view, the association with the British King should have ended when King Edward VIII \u201cvoluntarily relinquished his objectionable role here\u201d.Nicholas Mansergh, \u2018Survey of the British Commonwealth\u2019, pg. 274 In Professor Tom Garvin's review of the 1950s 'News from a New Republic', he comes in for praise as a moderniser. Garvin places him with a cross party group including Gerard Sweetman and Daniel Morrissey of Fine Gael as well as Se\u00e1n Lemass of Fianna F\u00e1il who were pushing a modernising agenda. He represented Kildare from 1932 until his death in 1963. In 1932, he became leader of the Labour Party. In the First Inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951, Norton became T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Welfare. In the Second Inter-Party Government from 1954 to 1957, Norton served as T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce. William Norton died in Dublin in 1963. His son Patrick Norton served as a TD for Kildare from 1965 to 1969. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Leaders of the Labour Party (Ireland) Category:Members of the 4th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 7th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 8th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 9th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 10th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 11th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 12th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Ministers for Social Affairs (Ireland) Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:Presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland) Category:T\u00e1naist\u00ed ",
