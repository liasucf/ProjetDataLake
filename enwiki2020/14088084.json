    "text": "The Civic Coalition (in Spanish, Coalici\u00f3n C\u00edvica) was a political coalition in Argentina. It was founded by Elisa Carri\u00f3, as an association supported by the ARI party (Support for an Egalitarian Republic), as well as a number of other political groups and individual political leaders, notably Union for All (UPT) of Patricia Bullrich and GEN - Generation for a National Encounter of Margarita Stolbizer. Carri\u00f3 ran for presidency on the 2007 election representing the Civic Coalition, along with the Socialist Party Senator for Santa Fe Province, Rub\u00e9n Giustiniani. The coalition lost the election, although it did well in the largest cities of Argentina, getting support especially from the urban middle and upper classes. Leading figures of the Coalition, as well as Carri\u00f3, Bullrich and Stolbizer, include Alfonso Prat Gay, former head of the Central Bank, and Senators Mar\u00eda Eugenia Estenssoro and Samuel Cabanchik. The embrace by Carri\u00f3 of these centrist figures proved controversial among more left-wing members of ARI and some national legislators declined to join the new expanded Civic Coalition grouping in Congress following the 2007 elections and instead formed a separate block called the Autonomous ARI. In May 2008, the block, led by Eduardo Macaluse, announced that they were forming a new party, Solidarity and Equality (Solidaridad e Igualdad - SI). Others who left ARI were Carlos Raimundi, Leonardo Gorbacz, Delia Bisutti, Nelida Belous, Ver\u00f3nica Venas, Emilio Garc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, Lidia Naim and Mar\u00eda Am\u00e9rica Gonz\u00e1lez.El ARI Aut\u00f3nomo mut\u00f3 a Solidaridad e Igualdad SI, parlamentario.com, 18 May 2008.

Several of the legislators who created the new party had won their seats in the 2007 election as part of the Civic Coalition, which they later opposed. The ARI deputies from Tierra del Fuego sit with the SI members in a separate block in the Chamber of Deputies. Subsequently Senators Mar\u00eda Rosa D\u00edaz and Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mart\u00ednez left ARI altogether in March 2009.Two opposition Senators side with the Government on eve of crucial vote to anticipate mid-term elections , Telam news agency, 25 March 2009.Senate votes today on early election , Buenos Aires Herald, 26 March 2009.
