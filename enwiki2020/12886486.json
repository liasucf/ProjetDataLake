Function |- | A |1 |RFC 1035 | Address record|| Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc. |- | AAAA |28 |RFC 3596 | IPv6 address record|| Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. |- | AFSDB |18 |RFC 1183 |AFS database record |Location of database servers of an AFS cell.

More info in this IETF Draft by DNSOP Working group and Akamai technologies. |} ==Other types and pseudo resource records== Other types of records simply provide some types of information (for example, an HINFO record gives a description of the type of computer/OS a host uses), or others return data used in experimental features. The \"type\" field is also used in the protocol for various operations. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! | Type ! | Type id. ! width=\"90pt\" | Defining RFC ! class=\"unsortable\" | Description ! class=\"unsortable\" | Function |-f |* |255 |RFC 1035 |All cached records |Returns all records of all types known to the name server. If the name server does not have any information on the name, the request will be forwarded on. The records returned may not be complete. For example, if there is both an A and an MX for a name, but the name server has only the A record cached, only the A record will be returned. Sometimes referred to as \"ANY\", for example in Windows nslookup and Wireshark. |- |AXFR |252 |RFC 1035 | Authoritative Zone Transfer |Transfer entire zone file from the master name server to secondary name servers. |- | IXFR |251 |RFC 1996 | Incremental Zone Transfer|| Requests a zone transfer of the given zone but only differences from a previous serial number. This request may be ignored and a full (AXFR) sent in response if the authoritative server is unable to fulfill the request due to configuration or lack of required deltas. |- | OPT |41 |RFC 6891 |Option |This is a \"pseudo DNS record type\" needed to support EDNS |} ==Obsolete record types== Progress has rendered some of the originally defined record-types obsolete. Of the records listed at IANA, some have limited use, for various reasons. Some are marked obsolete in the list, some are for very obscure services, some are for older versions of services, and some have special notes saying they are \"not right\". {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Type ! Type id. (decimal) ! Defining RFC ! Obsoleted by ! class=\"unsortable\" | Description |- | MD | 3 | rowspan=\"3\" | RFC 883 | rowspan=\"3\" | RFC 973 | rowspan=\"3\" | Mail destination (MD) and mail forwarder (MF) records; MAILA is not an actual record type, but a query type which returns MF and/or MD records. RFC 973 replaced these records with the MX record. |- | MF | 4 |- | MAILA | 254 |- | MB | 7 | rowspan=\"5\" | RFC 883 | rowspan=\"5\" | Not formally obsoleted. Unlikely to be ever adopted (RFC 2505). | rowspan=\"5\" | MB, MG, MR, and MINFO are records to publish subscriber mailing lists. MAILB is a query code which returns one of those records. The intent was for MB and MG to replace the SMTP VRFY and EXPN commands. MR was to replace the \"551 User Not Local\" SMTP error. Later, RFC 2505 recommended that both VRFY and EXPN be disabled, making MB and MG unnecessary. They were classified as experimental by RFC 1035. |- | MG | 8 |- | MR | 9 |- | MINFO | 14 |- | MAILB | 253 |- | WKS | 11 | RFC 883, RFC 1035 | Declared as \"not to be relied upon\" by RFC 1123 (more in RFC 1127). | Record to describe well-known services supported by a host.

Currently used by Cloudflare in response to queries of the type ANY. | Record intended to provide information about host CPU type and operating system.
