It was founded in 2004 and is organised by the Singapore Film Society, a non-profit organisation based in Singapore. The main aim of the festival is to showcase recent works from around the world, and there is also a local segment called the Singapore Showcase which portrays animation works by Singaporeans. This is to promote local talent and bring awareness to the public. Currently, Animation Nation is the largest known animation festival in the country.
