    "text": "The M970 Semi-Trailer Refueler is a fuel dispensing tanker designed for under/overwing refueling of aircraft. It is equipped with a filter/separator, recirculation system and two refueling systems, one for underwing and one for overwing servicing. The tanker is designed to be towed by a 5-ton, 6x6 truck tractor or similar vehicle equipped with a fifth wheel. The M970 can be loaded through the bottom or through the top fill openings. A ladder is provided at the front of the semitrailer for access to the top manhole, and a 4-cylinder diesel engine and pump assembly provides self load/unload capability. The body of the refueler is a 5,000-U.S.-gallon, single compartment, stainless steel tank. The chassis is of welded steel construction and is equipped with full floating tandem axles and a manually operated landing gear. There has been talk of retiring the M970, but a suitable off-road replacement has not been found. The Marine Corps also uses R-9 and R-10 tankers, but they are not capable of off road use. The M970 is a part of the \"United States Marine Corps Maintenance Center - Albany, Georgia, USA - An Integrated Enterprise Scheduling Case Study\" which is working to upgrade the Semitrailer for future use. U.S. Marine Corps R-9, Non-Tactical Aircraft Refueler The M967 and M969 versions are similar but are configured to carry vehicle fuels (gasoline, diesel). The M967A1, M969A1 and M970A1 versions relocate the top access ladder from the front of the tank to the rear. ==Utilization== The M970 can be used as a stand-alone fuel tanker, delivering fuel directly to aircraft on a flight line. The Semitrailer is also used in Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARPs) delivering fuel to multiple nozzles for quick fueling operations at the front lines or beyond. This is generally used for helicopters, but can also be utilized with AV-8B Harrier II or with an Expeditionary Airfield (EAF). M970's were used to assist in loading the bladders for the Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing Systems (TAFDS) in the field as well. Part of the TAFDS, the fuel bladders. The M969/M969A1 is a self loading and unloading tank semi-trailer designed to carry and dispense fuel to other vehicles at Forward Arming and Refueling Points. The M967/M967A1 is similar but it is designed to only carry bulk fuels between fuel terminals and depots and is not equipped to dispense fuel to other vehicles.TM-9-2330-356-14 ==Specifications== U.S. Marine Corps M970 All models of the M970/M970A1, M969/M969A1 and M967/M967A1 share a common basic chassis, motors, etc. The basic tank is a baffled tank.
