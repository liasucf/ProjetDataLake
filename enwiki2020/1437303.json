    "text": "The ZT-6 Mokopa is a South African air-to-ground anti-tank guided missile.https://www.forecastinternational.com/samples/F656_CompleteSample.pdf As of 2005 it is in its final stages of development, and is being integrated onto the South African Air Force's Rooivalk attack helicopters. The missile is produced by Denel Dynamics, formerly Kentron. The current version uses semi- active laser (SAL) guidance, requiring the target to be illuminated by a laser designator either on the launch platform or elsewhere; though there are alternative guidance packages available including a millimetre-wave radar (MMW) seeker and a two-colour imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. All variants of the Mokopa feature two launch modes, Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL). LOBL is the older, more conventional mode of missile launching, where the target has to be illuminated by the launch platform before launch. LOAL on the other hand allows the launch platform to launch the missile even though it may not be in sight of the target. In terms of the SAL version, this would then allow either the launch platform to move into place and only illuminate the target immediately prior to the missile striking the target, or it would allow an observer on the ground equipped with a laser designator to guide the missile in. This method of launching greatly reduces the exposure time of the launch platform to enemy fire. ==Development== Full scale development of the Mokopa began in November 1996, due to the ongoing United States arms embargo against South Africa making acquisition of the AGM-114 Hellfire impossible. The first air-launched tests from a Rooivalk helicopter took place in 1999, with the first guided tests following in 2000. As of 2005 the missile's development is virtually complete, and the first batches are currently being delivered to the SA Air Force's Rooivalk squadron. However, due to budgetary constraints the South African Air Force has decided to stop the integration of the weapon onto the Rooivalk until an unspecified date. ==Launch vehicles and platforms== Though primarily designed to be launched from a helicopter, the Mokopa has been tested on a variety of platforms, including its mounting on light armoured vehicles and on ships or small boats. For the latter purpose, the Mokopa is available with an anti-ship warhead. ==Warhead== The Mokopa uses a powerful tandem shaped-charge, high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, capable of penetrating over 1,350 mm (almost 4\u00bd ft) of Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA), and also effective against Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA). This means the Mokopa is able to counter any current vehicle armour threats. An anti-ship warhead is also available for customers who wish to use the Mokopa as a ship-board defence weapon, or as the armament of specialised ship-board helicopters. ==Performance== The missile is considered to be very accurate, with an accuracy believed to match that of the company's other anti-tank missile, the Ingwe, at around 300 mm CEP at maximum range. It also has a long range for an anti-tank missile; at 10 km (6.2 mi) it is greater than the published range of most current competitors, including the Hellfire. The range is achieved due to an advanced solid-fuel composite rocket motor (developed by Somchem), which has a relatively slow burning rate compared to similar motors, as well as being essentially smokeless. ==Users== * Algerian National Navy \u2013In 2012 Algeria also ordered 100 Mokopa anti-tank missiles in 2012 under a R360 million deal, according to SIPRI. These are destined for use aboard its Lynx naval helicopters that will be deployed on its new Meko A-200 frigates.http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php option=com_content&view;=article&id;=38561&catid;=74&Itemid;=30 According to Flightglobal, the Algerian Navy's six new Super Lynx 300-series helicopters were conducting flight tests in 2014 armed with Mokopa anti-armour missiles. ==See also== * List of missiles ===Comparable missiles=== * AGM-114 Hellfire * Brimstone missile ==References== ==External links== * Denel Dynamics * Denel Dynamics Product Brochures (PDF) Category:Air-to-surface missiles Category:Anti-tank missiles of South Africa Category:Guided missiles of South Africa Category:Post\u2013Cold War weapons of South Africa Category:Denel ",
