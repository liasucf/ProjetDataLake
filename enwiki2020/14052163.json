    "text": "Optical DownConverter (ODC) is an example of a non-linear optical process, in which two beams of light of different frequencies \\omega_1 and \\omega_2 interact, creating microwave with frequency \\omega_3 = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2 . It is a generalization of microwave. In the latter, \\omega_1 = \\omega_2, both of which can be provided by a single light source. From a quantum mechanical perspective, ODC can be seen as result of differencing two photons to produce a microwave. Since the energy of a photon is given by E_ u = \\hbar\\omega, the frequency summing \\omega_3 = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2 is simply a statement that energy is conserved. In a common ODC application, light from a tunable infrared laser is combined with light from a fixed frequency visible laser to produce a microwave created by a wave mixing process. The ODC use milimeteric microwave cavity that include photonic crystal that provide by two signal frequency light source. The microwave is detected by the cavity antenna. ==See also== *Sum-frequency generation *Homodyne detection ==External links== *Frequency Measurement *AdvR - Down conversion in KTiOPO4 (KTP) Category:Nonlinear optics ",
