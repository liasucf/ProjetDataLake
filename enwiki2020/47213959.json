    "text": "TMF Pure was a digital TV channel of MTV Networks Benelux. The channel launched together with three other digital channels of MTV Networks on 1 May 2005. This channel, TMF NL and TMF Dance were among the first digital theme channels in the Netherlands. On 1 August 2006 TMF Pure was renamed MTV Brand New. This digital channel emits, unlike TMF Pure, non-stop video clips from the alternative rock genre. Besides videos, there are also live performances on MTV Brand New. Since 1 August 2007 the station went on air again, along with two new thematic channels: Nick Hits and Nicktoons. TMF Pure sent nonstop music videos from the genres R&B;, rap and hip-hop and came back because The Box (which is focused on the same genre) ceased. After the reintegration of TMF Pure, MTV Brand New continued.
