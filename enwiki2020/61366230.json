    "text": "The 1916 Campeonato Carioca, the eleventh edition of that championship, kicked off on May 3, 1916 and ended on December 17, 1916. It was organized by LMSA (Liga Metropolitana de Sports Athleticos, or Metropolitan Athletic Sports League). Seven teams participated. Am\u00e9rica won the title for the 2nd time. No teams were relegated. ==Participating teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Club !! Home location !! Previous season |- | Am\u00e9rica || Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro || 3rd |- | Andarahy || Andara\u00ed, Rio de Janeiro || 1st (Second level) |- | Bangu || Bangu, Rio de Janeiro || 6th |- | Botafogo || Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro || 4th |- | Flamengo || Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro || 1st |- | Fluminense || Laranjeiras, Rio de Janeiro || 2nd |- | S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o || S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, Rio de Janeiro || 5th |- |} ==System== The tournament would be disputed in a double round-robin format, with the team with the most points winning the title. The team with the fewest points would dispute a playoff against the champions of the second level. ==Championship== ===Second-place playoffs=== The regulation also stipulated that the runners-up of the championship would also receive a trophy. Since Bangu and Botafogo tied in points for that position, they had to dispute a playoff. ===Relegation playoffs=== The last-placed team, S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, would dispute a playoff against Carioca, champions of the Second Level. S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o won the playoff, but Carioca would be promoted anyway as LMSA folded in early 1917, and the new league formed in its place, LMDT, expanded the championship to ten teams. ==References== Category:Campeonato Carioca seasons Carioca ",
