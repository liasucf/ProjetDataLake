    "text": "\"...(And That's No Lie)\" is a song by the British new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in 1985 as the third single from their third studio album How Men Are. It was written by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware, and produced by Ware and Greg Walsh. The song peaked at No. 52 in the UK and spent five weeks on the chart. A music video was filmed to promote the single. The 12\" single was released as a series of five separate records, though the only difference was the design of the sleeve. \"The Heaven 17 Megamix\" which appeared on the 12\" version of the single includes extracts of previous tracks \"This Is Mine\", \"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry\", \"Height of The Fighting (He La Hu)\", \"Penthouse and Pavement\", \"Temptation\", \"I'm Your Money\" and \"Play to Win\". ==Critical reception== Aaron Badgley of AllMusic said in a review of How Men Are: \"Highlights are numerous, including the very long but very wonderful \"And That's No Lie.\" A strong melody, stunning vocals from Glenn Gregory, and tight production equal a fascinating glimpse into the human struggle.\" ==Formats and track listings== ;7\" single # \"...(And That's No Lie)\" - 3:25 # \"The Fuse\" - 3:53 ;12\" single # \"...(And That's No Lie) (Re- mixed To Enhance Its Danceability)\" - 6:10 # \"The Fuse (L.P. version)\" - 3:05 # \"...(And That's No Lie) (L.P. version)\" - 10:02 ;12\" single (UK release) # \"...(And That's No Lie) (Re-mixed To Enhance Its Danceability)\" - 6:10 # \"The Fuse (L.P. version)\" - 3:05 # \"The Heaven 17 Megamix\" - 8:28 ;Cassette single (promo) # \"That's No Lie (7\" A)\" - 3:25 # \"The Fuse (7\" B)\" - 3:03 # \"That's No Lie (12\" A)\" - 6:10 # \"The Fuse\" - 3:03 # \"That's No Lie (LP version)\" - 10:05 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1985) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|52 |} ==Personnel== ;Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory - lead vocals, backing vocals * Martyn Ware - LinnDrum programming, backing vocals, producer * Ian Craig Marsh - synthesizer ;Additional personnel * Greg Walsh - producer * Sanny X - remixer of \"The Heaven 17 Megamix\" ==References== Category:1985 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh Category:1984 songs Category:Virgin Records singles ",
