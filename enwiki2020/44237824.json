In the review of the New York Times, Jane Langton wrote that the novel was \"For today's children, to whom World War II must seem as remote as the Civil War, Lily's story places history in real time\" and \"With Ms. Giff's usual easygoing language and swift, short paragraphs, the impact of the war on an American child is brilliantly told\". Although he also noted \"Still, what will the parents who buy so many of Ms. Giff's books think of this one, if they pause to read it themselves? Is Lily Mollahan a good role model for their children?\".Langton, Jane.May 18, 1997. \"The Home Front.\" The New York Times On The Web. Retrieved 18 May 1997.
