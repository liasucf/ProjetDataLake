    "text": "Flooding from Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, one of North Carolina's worst natural disasters The list of North Carolina hurricanes from 1980 to 1999 encompasses approximately 68 tropical or subtropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of North Carolina. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in around $10 billion in damage (2007 USD), primarily from hurricanes Fran and Floyd. Additionally, tropical cyclones in North Carolina were responsible for about 56 direct fatalities and at least 47 indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in the 1985 season, which was the year with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state. All but two storms were North Atlantic hurricanes; the exceptions were Eastern Pacific hurricanes Tico in 1983 and Roslyn in 1986. The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the time period was Hurricane Fran in 1996, which struck near Wilmington as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; Hurricane Emily in 1993 brushed the Outer Banks also as a Category 3 hurricane. The deadliest hurricane during the period was Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which caused 35 fatalities and record-breaking flooding in the eastern portion of the state. Cyclones affected the state in each month of the hurricane season from June to November, primarily in September. ==1980\u20131984== Hurricane Diana just offshore * August 27, 1980 \u2013 Northeasterly winds from Hurricane Charley contribute to six deaths from strong rip currents. * June 7, 1981 \u2013 The remnants of a tropical depression bring light precipitation to the state. * July 1, 1981 \u2013 Tropical Storm Bret moves ashore on Virginia, with its outer rainbands dropping light rainfall across North Carolina. * August 20, 1981 \u2013 Tropical Storm Dennis brushes the Outer Banks with moderate rainfall peaking at 10.7 inches (271 mm) near Wilmington; scattered power outages and road closures from flooding are reported, but damage is minimal. * November 12, 1981 \u2013 A subtropical Storm produces coastal flooding and beach erosion along the East Coast of the United States. * June 19, 1982 \u2013 Subtropical Storm One brushes the coastline and causes some minor flooding due to locally moderate precipitation. * September 11, 1982 \u2013 Tropical Storm Chris makes landfall on Louisiana, and several days later its moisture drops light rainfall in western North Carolina. * September 30, 1983 \u2013 Tropical Storm Dean hits the eastern Virginia coastline and produces scattered rainfall across North Carolina. * October 24, 1983 \u2013 The remnants of Eastern Pacific Hurricane Tico drop moderate precipitation across the state. * September 13, 1984 \u2013 Hurricane Diana strikes near Cape Fear with winds of about 100 mph (150 km/h) after weakening from peak winds of Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
