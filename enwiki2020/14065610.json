For the last four times, he led another First Division League team South China, including for the last season in 2006-07. * Originally, Eastern should have regulated to the Third 'A' Division League for the 2007-08 season, and therefore unqualified for competing in Senior Shield. However, the team was invited to enter the First Division and was able to compete in Senior Shield. This was similar to the case happened in the previous season for the champion team South China, as South China should have regulated to the Second Division League and unqualified for Senior Shield. ==See also== *Hong Kong Senior Shield *The Hong Kong Football Association *Hong Kong FA Cup 2007-08 *Hong Kong First Division League 2007-08 *Hong Kong League Cup 2007-08 ==References== ==External links== * Fixtures at HKFA.com Shield, 2007-08 Category:Hong Kong Senior Shield Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield, 2007-08 ",
