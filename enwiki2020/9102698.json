    "text": "\"Partytime!\" is a special promotional CD release by pop singer Gloria Estefan. Released in 1998, \"Partytime!\" was sold only in Target Corporation department stores as a promotion for the Gloria! album. A complementary Spanish-language remix single, Bailando!, was released at the same time, again sold only at Target. Both are now considered rare by collectors. There is only one track on the CD: \"The Party Time Megamix\", a 22-minute megamix of nine of Gloria's biggest hits up to that point, including a few with Miami Sound Machine. Several of these songs were redone in a House or Techno style. ==Megamix song sequence== * \"Dr. Beat\" * \"Conga\" * \"I'm Not Giving You Up\" * \"You'll Be Mine (Party Time)\" * \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\" * \"1-2-3\" * \"Get On Your Feet\" * \"Everlasting Love\" * \"Turn The Beat Around\" ==Production credits== *Producer: Pablo Flores for Estefan Enterprises Inc. *Remix and additional production on \"Turn The Beat Around\" by Pablo Flores. *Keyboards and programming by Lester Mendez. *Mixed by Javier Garza.
