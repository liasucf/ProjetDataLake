The high priority project involved Hungarian, Polish and Soviet engineers from several companies and organizations. Construction works started in 1974, with several farmhouses and barns having been demolished on the intended site. It was completed in 1977 and went on air the same year. The transmitter site underwent a substantial renovation and equipment modernisation in 2017.https://www.ahrt.hu/hu/hirek/befejezodtek-a-solti- kozephullamu-radioallomas-rekonstrukcios-munkai ==Equipment== The original 1977 transmitter was made of two identical, Soviet-made vacuum tube based 1000kW units, combined for the required 2000kW output power.http://www.hte.hu/fooldal/-/hir/40-eves-a-solti-radioado-allomas It was replaced in 2017 by a solid state Nautel NX2000 consisting of five DRM-enabled NX400 units combined for 2000kW output.http://www.nautel.com/solutions/digital-radio/2-megawatt-transmitter- antenna-hungaria/ The original vacuum tube transmitter (being a preserved industrial monument) remains on site as a functional backup unit.http://www.hte.hu/fooldal/-/hir/latogatas-a-solti-kozephullamu- radioallomason-a-media-klub-a-veteltechnikai-es-a-kabeltelevizios-szakosztaly- beszamoloja ==See also== *Kossuth R\u00e1di\u00f3 *Lakihegy Tower *List of masts *List of European medium wave transmitters *List of tallest structures in Hungary == References == * Press photos on the webpage of the operator (Antenna Hung\u00e1ria Zrt.) * * Category:Radio masts and towers in Hungary Category:Towers in Hungary Category:Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations Category:Hungarian People's Republic Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Hungary Category:Towers completed in 1977 Category:Buildings and structures in B\u00e1cs-Kiskun County ",
