Ref |- | 1923 || Lost and Found on a South Sea Island || Raoul Walsh || House Peters, Pauline Starke || Originally, only one reel was known to have survived, according to a recent biography of Walsh. However, a complete print was found in the Italian archive Cineteca Del Friuli in Gemona. || The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Lost and Found on a South Sea Island |- | 1924 || Detained || Scott Pembroke, Joe Rock|| Stan Laurel|| Missing scenes found and restored by Fries Film Archief, Netherlands, 2017. || |- |rowspan=\"3\"| 1927 || The Battle of the Century || Clyde Bruckman || Laurel and Hardy || For decades, the excerpt included in the 1957 compilation film The Golden Age of Comedy was thought to be the only remaining footage, until the first reel (featuring a boxing match) was found in the late 1970s, but scenes featuring Eugene Pallette, and a final climactic gag showing a cop receiving a pie in the face were missing until the second reel was discovered in a private collection in June 2015. || |- || Metropolis || Fritz Lang||Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich, Brigitte Helm || After the German premiere, nearly a quarter of Metropolis was cut. Over the years, some of the missing footage resurfaced. In 2008, two different versions of the film were found: one by Museo del Cine from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and another in the National Film Archive of New Zealand. Both versions were then edited into one cut to get as near the original version as possible.|| |- || Napol\u00e9on || Abel Gance || Albert Dieudonn\u00e9, Gina Man\u00e8s, Antonin Artaud Edmond Van Da\u00eble || Gance destroyed the original uncut negatives that lasted 6 hours in the 1950s, but film historian Kevin Brownlow tracked down various prints of the film and made a final cut lasting 5 hours. || |- | 1962 || King Kong vs. Godzilla|| Ishir\u014d Honda || Tomoyuki Tanaka, Shinichi Sekizawa || A few years later after its release in Japan, Toho made extensive cuts to the film and re-released it. Later, Toho made even more cuts for future re-releases, and the removed footage then went lost. During the 1980s, numerous efforts were made to find the missing scenes, but nothing turned up until the 1990s and 2000s, when all these scenes were found. After recovery, Toho re-released the film once more, with all the missing footage restored.|| |} ==References== Category:Lists of films ",
