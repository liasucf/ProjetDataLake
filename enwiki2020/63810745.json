    "text": "The Franklin-Simpson Stakes is a Grade III American Thoroughbred horse race for three years olds, over a distance of furlongs on the turf held annually in September at Kentucky Downs racetrack in Franklin, Kentucky during their short turf meeting. The event currently carries an offered purse of $500,000. ==History== The race was inaugurated in 2001 as the Yaqthan Stakes for three years olds and older over a distance of 1 mile. The event was named after Yaqthan who had won in 1998 the Kentucky Cup Turf Stakes. The event was idle for 2 seasons and was resumed in 2004. In 2008 the event was renamed to Franklin-Simpson Stakes honor the city and county where the Kentucky Downs racetrack is located. For the 2012 and 2013 runnings the event was known as the Franklin-Simpson Mile Stakes. Once again the event was idle for three years and when the event was resurrected it was set as a three years old event. In 2019 the event was upgraded to a Grade III. With the influx of gaming revenue at Kentucky Downs the purse for the event has risen dramatically to nearly $500,000 offered by 2019. ==Records== Speed record: * furlongs - 1:15.87 - Guildsman (FR) (2020) * 1 mile - 1:35.27 - Demarcation (2008) Margins: * lengths - Depeche Chat (2012) ;Most wins by a jockey * 2 - Brian Hernandez Jr. (2012, 2018) * 2 - Rafael Bejarano (2005, 2019) ;Most wins by a trainer * 2 - Charles Simon (2001, 2005) ;Most wins by an owner * 2 - Kenneth L. and Sarah K.
