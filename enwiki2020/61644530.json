    "text": "Artificial wisdom is a software system that can demonstrate one or more qualities of being wise. Artificial wisdom can be described as artificial intelligence reaching the top-level of decision-making when confronted with the most complexe challenging situations. The term artificial wisdom is used when the \"intelligence\" is based on more than by chance collecting and interpreting data, but by design enriched with smart and conscience strategies that wise people would use. The worries about the future with artificial intelligence is bend to a more positive perspective when considering computer- aided wisdom; the collaboration between artificial intelligence and contemplative neuroscience. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * Gopnik, Alison, \"Making AI More Human: Artificial intelligence has staged a revival by starting to incorporate what we know about how children learn\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 60\u201365. * Marcus, Gary, \"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58\u201363.

An example is the \"pronoun disambiguation problem\": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence refers.
