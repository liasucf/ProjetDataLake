The album produced one single, \"Out of Work\" which peaked at #21 on the Billboard Pop Singles charts.www.garyusbonds.com[ www.allmusic.com] According to the liner notes on the Razor & Tie reissue, after recording the album, Columbia Records had Bruce Springsteen remove his vocals from the tracks, specifically from the track \"Angelyne\", so Van Zandt stepped up to record the duet instead. Because of this, although Springsteen can still be heard on several of the tracks, he is not credited in the original liner notes. Additionally, the liner notes state that three other songs were recorded for the album but not present on the final release including Springsteen's \"Action In the Street\", \"Lion's Den\", and \"Savin' Up\".On the Line album liner notesbrucebase.wikispaces.com Springsteen's version of \"Lion's Den\" was eventually released in 1998 on his boxset Tracks and \"Savin' Up\" appeared on Clarence Clemons' first solo album Rescue (1983); \"Action in the Street\" remains unreleased.
