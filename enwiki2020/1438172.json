She took part in fleet exercises off Central America from 5 February to 6 April 1923. Returning to San Pedro on 10 April, R-2 was ordered to Hawaii on 16 July with Division 9 and remained for eight years developing submarine tactics with the Fleet. She made an endurance cruise to Midway Island in July and August 1924. Leaving Pearl Harbor on 12 December 1930, R-2 was reassigned to the Atlantic fleet and arrived at New London via the Panama Canal on 9 February 1931.

Assigned to Division 12 on 1 June 1941, R-2 departed New London on 16 June and six days later arrived at Key West, Florida, her new homeport. Based there for the remainder of her career, she was attached to the Fleet Sonar School, and assigned periodically to defensive patrols in keeping with her limited operational capabilities, until the spring of 1945. Then, with the approach of German capitulation, she was ordered to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for inactivation.
