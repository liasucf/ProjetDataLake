Utermann currently serves as Governor of Birkbeck, University of London. http://www.bbk.ac.uk/news/new-governor-appointments-for- birkbeck ==Early life and education== Andreas Utermann was born in Brussels to German parents and attended the European School before moving to the UK to study at the London School of Economics, from which he graduated with a degree in Economics in 1989. He subsequently undertook a master's degree in Economics at the University of Leuven, having agreed to defer his entry into Warburg's graduate programme for a year in order to do so. Utermann also holds the CFA's ASIP qualification. ==Career== Utermann joined Mercury Asset Management in 1989, becoming head of pan-European and subsequently global equities over the course of his 13 years there. He left Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (as Mercury became known a couple of years after its 1997 acquisition by Merrill Lynch) in 2002. In 2002, Utermann joined Allianz to become its global CIO for equities. When Allianz's asset management division restructured in 2011, Utermann became Global CIO and co-head of Allianz Global Investors alongside Elizabeth Corley as CEO; in a 2012 media story headlined \u201cMercury keeps rising at AllianzGI\u201d, the journalist noted that the co-head structure followed \u201cthe mixed gender trail blazed by Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, former co- heads of Mercury Asset Management, where both Utermann and Corley honed their craft.\u201d Utermann was sole CEO since 2016, when Corley moved into a non- executive role within the firm. During his time in charge of Allianz Global Investors, Utermann expanded its investment offering further into bonds (for instance with the acquisition of Rogge Global Partners in early 2016) and creating a dedicated Alternative investments function. Utermann retired as CEO of AllianzGI on 31 December 2019 and served as advisor to the firm until 30.6.2020.

Despite leading an active manager, he has acknowledged perception challenges facing the industry in light of cheaper passive investing alternatives such as ETFs. In 2014, Utermann wrote in the Financial Times that active investors needed to take concerted action to generate meaningful outperformance for clients and avoid becoming so-called closet trackers.https://www.ft.com/content/cefe1e7a-b4e1-11e3-9166-00144feabdc0 In 2016, he wrote in the same paper about the perils of smart beta products.https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/allianz-global-investors-elizabeth- corley-andreas-utermann-20140625 Writing of Utermann in IPE magazine in 2018, journalist Carlo Svaluto Moreolo wrote: \"It would be hard to find a more passionate supporter of active management. However, he starts with the candid admission that the asset management industry has a reputational problem.\" He has argued for greater transparency across the investment value chain. More recently, he has advocated the greater use of performance fees, introducing new products and share classes where the fund manager is only rewarded for the additional value created. Since 2012, Utermann was the driver behind AllianzGI's aggressive expansion into Alternatives, in particular on the non- public market side.https://www.institutionalassetmanager.co.uk/2014/12/09/214430/allianzgi- establishes-alternatives-group-assets-more-double-12-months ==Sustainable investing== Utermann is known as a strong proponent of the need for Diversity in Business and the Sustainable Investing Agenda. https://www.institutionalassetmanager.co.uk/2017/11/27/258684/cfa-uk-launches- gender-diversity-partner-programme In January 2019 he was announced as one of the founding members of the New Climate Finance Leadership Initiative.https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberg-announces- founding-members-new-climate-finance-leadership-initiative/ In September 2019, as part of the Bloomberg Global Business Forum, Utermann announced that Allianz Global Investors was launching an Impact Fund that will invest directly into such projects.
