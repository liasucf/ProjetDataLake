    "text": "\"Will You Marry Me?\" is a song by American artist Paula Abdul, released as the fifth and final single from her 1991 album Spellbound. The song was written by Abdul, Peter Lord, Sandra St. Victor and V. Jeffrey Smith. ==Song information== The ballad was released right as Abdul became engaged and married to Emilio Estevez. They married in California on April 29, 1992 but then divorced two years later in May 1994. Stevie Wonder made a special guest appearance on the track playing the harmonica. The single's b-side was a track from the Spellbound sessions called \"Good Night, My Love (Pleasant Dreams)\"; it was recorded for a compilation as well, called For Our Children, whose proceeds benefited the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Like the previous single \"Vibeology\", the single reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at number 19), becoming a modest hit for Abdul. The music video for the song featured a digital composite of five versions of Abdul wearing similarly coloured white outfits. Each \"version\" of Abdul performs a different style of dance to the song (ballet, jazz etc...) and ultimately settle into a choreographed routine in which they dance with one another, concluding with one Abdul dancing with and being carried off by a translucent partner. ==Track listings and formats== === US cassette === # Will You Marry Me? - Album Version (Peter Lord; Sandra St. Victor; V.
