It peaked at #7 on Billboard's \"Top New Age Albums\" chart in 1999. ==Critical reception== In a review by Chuck Donkers of AllMusic, \"Yanni's early albums for the Private Music label are mined for Forbidden Dreams, which spotlights his famously dramatic, even flamboyant synthesizer style in its embryonic stages; in addition to the title track, the compilation includes the fan favorites \"After the Sunrise\" and \"Keys to Imagination\" from the-80s.\" ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== *Official Website * Category:Yanni albums Category:1998 compilation albums ",
