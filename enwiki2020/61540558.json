The book is about the world of botany as described and explored through Native American traditions. Kimmerer, who is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, also shares stories about her own experiences working with plants and learning to become reunited with her own people's cultural traditions. She also gives a background on history in relation to plants and also discusses botany through a scientific perspective. American Indian Quarterly writes that Braiding Sweetgrass is a book about traditional ecological knowledge and environmental humanities. Kimmerer combines her training in Western scientific methods and her Native American knowledge about sustainable land stewardship to describe a more joyful and ecological way of using our land in Braiding Sweetgrass. Kimmerer said about the book that \"I wanted readers to understand that Indigenous knowledge and Western science are both powerful ways of knowing, and that by using them together we can imagine a more just and joyful relationship with the Earth.\" Plants described in the book include squash, algae, goldenrod, pecans and the eponymous sweetgrass. ==Honors and awards== Kimmerer received the 2014 Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award for her book Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.Hertzel, Laurie. \"Braiding Sweetgrass\" wins Sigurd Olson nature writing award, Star Tribune, May 7, 2014. == Reviews == Native Studies Review writes that Braiding Sweetgrass is a \"book to savour and to read again and again.\" Heather Sullivan writes in the \"Journal of Germanic Studies\" that \"one occasionally encounters a text like an earthquake: it shakes one\u2019s fundamental assumptions with a massive shift that, in comparison, renders mere epiphanies bloodless: Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s Braiding Sweetgrass is one of these kinds of books.\u201d Sue O'Brian in \"Library Journal\" wrote \"Kimmerer writes of investigating the natural world with her students and her efforts to protect and restore plants, animals, and land. A trained scientist who never loses sight of her Native heritage, she speaks of approaching nature with gratitude and giving back in return for what we receive. VERDICT Anyone who enjoys reading about natural history, botany, protecting nature, or Native American culture will love this book\". Kathleen D. Moore in \"The Bryologist\" says that \"\"Braiding Sweetgrass\" is far more than a memoir or a field guide. I would call it a wisdom book, because I believe that Robin has something world- changing to pass along, an ethos she has learned by listening closely to plants\". The Tribal College Journal wrote \"Each chapter is an adventurous journey into the world of plants.\" Publishers Weekly call Kimmerer a \"mesmerizing storyteller\" in Braiding Sweetgrass. The Star Tribune writes that Kimmerer is able to give readers the ability to see the common world in a new way. == References == Category:Books about Native American history Category:Botany books Category:Ecology books Category:Ethnobotany Category:Indian philosophy Category:Native American culture Category:Native American novels Category:American non-fiction books Category:2013 non-fiction books ",
