The album was re-released in CD in 2002. ==Background== Joe Camilleri says; \"I was really into zydeco music, so I got a bunch of desperadoes together, including Steve McTaggart on violin, George Butrumlis on piano accordion, Paul Williamson on clarinet, Wayne Burt on guitar, Wayne Duncan on bass, and Gary Young on drums. We did a couple of gigs and said, Hey, let\u2019s make a record. I\u2019d recommend that any band do things themselves. Making a record can be as expensive or as inexpensive as you want. You can make a record on a credit card, if you want.\" == Track listing == ;CD track listing ==References== ==External links== * \"Rockin' Zydeco\" at discogs.com Category:1985 albums Category:The Black Sorrows albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
