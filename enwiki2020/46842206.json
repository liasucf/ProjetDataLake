A divulgator of traditional folk music of the South Italy, particularly of Sicily and Calabria, in 1964 he got a large critical acclaim with the album Il treno del sole , consisting of Ignazio Buttitta's poems set to music; the album also marked the start of a progressive evolution of his style, which became more original and distinguishing. His career had its peak in the 1970s, with the success of the albums Il brigante Musolino (a musical recount of life events of Giuseppe Musolino) and Qua si campa d'aria, which sold over a million copies and was awarded gold disc. From the 1980s he focused his activities on live performances and concerts. Profazio also presented several television music programs, notably Quando la gente canta for five years on Secondo Canale. For 15 years he also wrote a weekly column (\"Profaziate\") in the newspaper Gazzetta del Sud, whose contents were later collected in a series of books. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * * Category:1936 births Category:People from Rende Category:Living people Category:Italian male singers Category:Italian folk singers Category:Italian singer-songwriters Category:Italian record producers Category:Sicilian- language singers ",
