Rod: The Autobiography (2012): 225-226 The song featured on Stewart's album Blondes Have More Fun, and was released as a single in November 1978. It spent one week at the top of the British charts in December 1978 and four weeks at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979. Billboard ranked it number four on its Top Singles of 1979 year-end chart.\"Top Singles of the Year\" Billboard 22 December 1979: TIA-10 It also topped the charts in Australia for two weeks. Royalties from the song were donated to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Stewart performed the song at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in January 1979.(AP) \"Frost Sets UNICEF Show\" The Robesonian 30 November 1978: 1 Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 308 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Background and writing== Carmine Appice, who played drums on this song told Songfacts: \"This was a story of a guy meeting a chick in a club. At that time, that was a cool saying. If you listen to the lyrics, 'She sits alone, waiting for suggestions, he's so nervous...' it's the feelings of what was going on in a dance club. The guy sees a chick he digs, she's nervous and he's nervous and she's alone and doesn't know what's going on, then they end up at his place having sex, and then she's gone.\" In a 2007 interview, co-writer Duane Hitchings noted that \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" was It has been noted that Stewart created parts of the song through musical plagiarism. A copyright infringement lawsuit by Brazilian musician Jorge Ben Jor claimed the chorus of the song had been derived from his song \"Taj Mahal\". The case was \"settled amicably\" according to Jorge Ben Jor, in Ben Jor's favor.Interview with Ben Jor Expatica.com Stewart admitted in his 2012 autobiography to \"unconscious plagiarism\" of the Ben Jor song, which he had heard while attending the Rio Carnival in 1978. He also admitted that he had consciously lifted the song's signature synthesizer riff from the string arrangement on Bobby Womack's \"(If You Want My Love) Put Something Down On It\". Stewart contends that it is legal to lift a line from any song's arrangement as long as the core melody line is not copied. ==Reception== The song was criticised by many in the rock press as a betrayal of Stewart's blues-oriented rock roots, due to its disco-like arrangement, but Stewart and others were quick to point out that other widely respected artists, such as Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones, had also released disco-flavoured songs. However, the song has since experienced some retrospective acclaim as Rolling Stone placed the song at number 308 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Charts and certifications== === Weekly charts === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1978\u201379) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |align=\"center\"|1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Canada Disco 30 (RPM) |align=\"center\"|7 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |align=\"center\"|1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Finland (Finnish Singles Chart) |align=\"center\"|9 |- ! scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP) You have to use the index at the top of the page and search \"Rod Stewart\" |align=\"center\"|2 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA)Search for Irish peaks |align=\"center\"|5 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Italy (FIMI) 13\\.

He noted that \"with its recognizable hook, booty-shakin' baseline, guest rap by Ricardo da Force, diva wailings by Kelly Llorenna, and Stewart himself, this updated remake could very well become the surprise radio hit of the summer. Of course, it could also become this month's novelty record.\" ===Charts=== === Weekly charts === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997\u20131998) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI) |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |7 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Mahasz) |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA) |10 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi) |3 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |11 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |99 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) |80 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |67 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |43 |- !scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |62 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |86 |} ===Certifications=== ==2017 DNCE remix version== In 2017, Stewart released a remix version featuring American band DNCE.
