    "text": "Many places throughout Alabama take their names from the languages of the indigenous Native American/American Indian tribes. The following list includes settlements, geographic features, and political subdivisions whose names are derived from these indigenous languages. The primary Native American peoples present in Alabama during historical times included the Alibamu, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Koasati, and the lower and upper Muscogee (Creeks). With the exception of the Cherokee, all of the historical Alabama tribes speak Muskogean languages. There are competing classification systems, but the traditionally accepted usage divides the dialects into Eastern Muskogean (Alibamu, Koasatia, and Muscogee) and Western Muskogean (Chickasaw and Choctaw). The Cherokee language belongs to the separate Iroquoian language family. ==Listings== *Alabama and Alabama River - named for the Alibamu, a tribe whose name derives from a Choctaw phrase meaning either \"thicket- clearers\" or \"plant-cutters\" (from albah, (medicinal plants) and amo, (to clear). *Autauga County - named for the Alibamu town of Atagi (pure water). *Arbacoochee - from the Muskogean word \"abihkuchi\", which translates to \"a pile at the base.\" *Attalla - from the Cherokee word otali (mountain). *Bashi - adaptation of the Choctaw word bachaya (line, row, or course). *Bogue Chitto - from Choctaw words book (creek or stream) and chito (big). *Boligee - originally a war name, from the Choctaw words booli (to strike) and tusha (to cut to pieces). *Buttahatchee River - from the Choctaw words bati (sumac) and hahcha (river). *Cahaba and Cahaba River - probable corruption of two Choctaw words oka (water) and uba (above). *Chattahoochee River - from the Muskogean words chato (rock) and huchi (marked). *Chattooga River - may derive from the Cherokee word jitaaga (chicken) or Muscogee cato (rock). *Cheaha Mountain - derived from the Choctaw word chaha (high. *Cherokee and Cherokee County - named for the Cherokee tribe. *Chewacla and Chewacla State Park - derived from the Hitchiti word sawackla, with sawi meaning \"racoon\" and ukli meaning \"town\". *Chickasaw - named for the Chickasaw tribe. *Choctaw County - named for the Choctaw tribe. *Choctawhatchee River - Choctaw word hacha (river) and the name for the tribe, literally the \"River of the Choctaws\". *Conecuh County and Conecuh River - probably from the Muscogee words koha (canebrake) and anaka (near} or, also from Muscogee, kono (skunk) and ekv (its head}. *Coosa County and Coosa River, probable origin is Choctaw word koshak (cane). *Coosada - named for the Coushatta/Koasati tribe. *Cusseta - a Muscogee tribal town. *Eastaboga, Alabama - from Muscogee este (person), ak (in water, a low place), pokv (from the work vpoketv: to sit/live). *Escambia County - from Choctaw words oski ambeha (cane therein). *Escatawpa and Escatawpa River - in the Choctaw language, the word \"escatawpa\" signified a creek where cane was cut, with uski meaning \"cane\", a meaning \"there\", and tapa meaning \"cut\". *Etowah County - possibly from a Cherokee settlement named Etiwaw. *Eufaula - from the Muscogee yofalv, the name of a tribal town. *Eutaw - possibly from the Cherokee Etiwaw (see Etowah above) and its earlier form iitaawaa (long leafed pine tree).
