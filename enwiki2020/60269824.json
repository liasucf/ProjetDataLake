The film stars Rio Raj in his lead acting debut, Shirin Kanchwala, and RJ Vigneshkanth in the lead roles, while Nanjil Sampath, Vivek Prasanna, Radha Ravi, and Mayilsamy play supportive roles. The film is produced by actor Sivakarthikeyan under his production banner Sivakarthikeyan Productions. Singaporean composer Shabir was roped into score music for the film. ==Plot== The film starts with Shiva (Rio Raj) and Vicky (RJ Vigneshkanth) getting a lift in car because their bike got repaired when they were going to a place. Then, they are thinking about their past life. A few months ago, their childhood brother Ram (Chutti Aravind) and they both are living in a house for rent. Ram has a little respect on his house owner (Mayilsamy), but they both are not. Then, the film tells that Shiva and Vicky both have a YouTube channel called \"Nenjamundu Nermaiyundu\". One day, they went to a mall and did a prank. They both keep the knives on the necks of a big businessman named \"Jeepakaran\" (Radha Ravi) and a press reporter named \"Nisha\" (Shirin Kanchwala). Then, Jeepakaran realised that the two men are doing a prank and openly told them that both of them are doing a prank. In that anger, Nisha slapped Shiva. Then, Jeepakaran called Shiva and Vicky and asked them why are they doing these pranks, to which they said that they are doing the pranks for money. The next day, Shiva, Vicky, and Ram helped two beggars in Marina Beach, and Nisha sees this. She and Shiva both fall in love themselves, but they both do not know that the other one is loving themselves. The same day, Shiva and Vicky realized that Jeepakaran's PA (Put Chutney Rajmohan) is following them. Shiva and Vicky are assigned to do three tasks by Jeepakaran: be part of a breaking news, elect a mentally-challenged guy as an MLA, and stop a murder in a railway station. They successfully complete the previous two tasks and want to know the reason behind the third task. Here, Jeepakaran unfolds his flashback. His son Anbu (\"Idhu Adhu Illa\" Ayaz) wished to be a reporter, but his father wants him to take over his business. An uninterested Anbu joins a TV channel. One day, he overhears a plan of a murder and plans to stop it. Unfortunately, he fails in the attempt because the people had not helped him, and he got killed. In that anger, Jeepakaran decides to elect a mentally challenged man as an MLA and fulfill his son's wish by using Shiva and Vicky. They successfully complete the third task and save the girl from the plan of murder. == Cast == * Rio Raj as \"Prank Star\" Shiva * Shirin Kanchwala as Nisha * RJ Vigneshkanth as Vicky * Nanjil Sampath as a Politician, Nisha's father * Radha Ravi as Jeepakaran, Anbu's father * Mayilswamy as House Owner * Vivek Prasanna as Local Goon * Bijili Ramesh as Bijili Ramesh, a politician * Janani Balasubramaniyam as Jeepakaran's Assistant * \"Idhu Adhu Illa\" Ayaz as Anbu * Chutti Aravind as Ram, Shiva's brother * \"Naan Komali\" Ram Nishanth as Mani * Put Chutney Rajmohan as Jeepakaran's PA * Settai Sherif as Minister's son * \"Kutty Munji\" Vivek Anandan as Kutty Munji * Prakash Arumugam as Reporter * \"Kadavul\" Vj Vishnu as Reporter * \"Mirugam\" Aravind Seiju as Subscriber * \"Machakaaran\" Kutti Vino * \"Adirchi\" Arun as a Subscriber * Sherif Basha as a Subscriber * Sabari as Newsreader * Balaji Thyagarajan as Youngster * Narendra Prasath \"NP\" * Nandhini * Anbu Thasan * Kalaiyarasan Thangavel == Production == The film cast consists mainly of YouTube personalities (YouTubers) from a YouTube channel called Black Sheep including the director, VJ turned-lead actor Rio Raj and RJ-turned comedian RJ Vigneshkanth.
