    "text": "Dionysios () or Dimitrios () Kasdaglis () (10 October 1872 in Salford - 1931) was a Greek-Egyptian tennis player. He competed in the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 1906 Intercalated Games, also in Athens. ==Career== The men's singles final in 1896, which Kasdaglis lost to Boland Kasdaglis was born in England, was domiciled in Egypt but according to the official bulletin he participated as a member of the Greek team. He made it to the finals in both the singles and doubles events. In the singles, he defeated Defert of France in the first round, Konstantinos Akratopoulos of Greece in the second, and Momcsill\u00f3 Tapavicza of Hungary in the semifinals before facing John Pius Boland of Great Britain and Ireland in the final. Boland proved the better player, and Kasdaglis finished second. The medal is credited to Kasdaglis as a Greek by the International Olympic Committee. For the doubles tournament, Kasdaglis paired with Demetrios Petrokokkinos in a mixed team.The International Olympic Committee's medals database lists this as a mixed team; however, Kasdaglis is himself identified as Greek and Petrokokkinos, whose nationality is not explicitly mentioned by the IOC database, is elsewhere always listed as Greek. They defeated another pair of Greeks, Konstantinos Paspatis and Evangelos Rallis, in the first round and the British/Australian pair of George S. Robertson and Edwin Flack in the semifinals. In the final, Kasdaglis again faced Boland, this time paired with Friedrich Traun of Germany. Kasdaglis and Petrokokkinos lost that match to give Kasdaglis his second silver medal. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1931 deaths Category:19th-century Egyptian people Category:19th-century male tennis players Category:Date of death missing Category:Egyptian male tennis players Category:Egyptian people of Greek descent Category:Greek male tennis players Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic tennis players of Greece Category:Olympic silver medalists for Greece Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Sportspeople from Alexandria Category:Tennis players at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 1906 Intercalated Games ",
