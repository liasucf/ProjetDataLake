An example of rope bondage at BoundCon, Germany, 2008 Rope used in erotic bondage is usually soft to avoid chafing the skin, and easy to twist and straighten A playful, less restrictive form of rope bondage is a common magic trick at cabaret performances Rope bondage, also referred to as rope play, kinbaku, shibari, Fesselspiele, is bondage involving the use of rope to restrict movement, wrap, suspend, or restrain a person, as part of BDSM activities. Japanese bondage is the most publicly visible style of rope bondage. An alternative style, \"Western bondage\" is about achieving restraint; the Japanese are more concerned with the artistry of the process. ==History== Rope bondage derives from the erotic Japanese bondage art form of shibari, which was in turn developed from the now-defunct Japanese military restraint technique of hoj\u014djutsu. The rope dress is not of itself a form of restraint, but is used either by itself as an adornment, or incorporated into restraining bondage. ==Materials== Bondage ropes used come in a variety of materials and length. Japanese bondage traditionally uses natural fibers such as hemp and jute which are cut into approximately lengths. Western-style bondage typically uses longer ropes that span a wider variety of materials. * Ropes (typically of a nylon or cotton variety) * Household furniture == Technique == === Spreadeagle === Woman tied on St. Andrew's cross A four-poster bed is sometimes used to achieve this position with the arms and legs restrained at the ankles and wrists. === St. Andrew's Cross === The St. Andrew's Cross is shaped like the letter 'X'. The points of each section act as anchor points for restraining the arms and legs. === Chair tie === A woman bound to a chair at BoundCon 2013 A chair tie is a form of furniture bondage, a bondage technique which has multiple forms. It typically places the subject in a chair with wrists bound to the arm rests of the chair or bound behind the subject's back and behind the back rest. The subject's ankles are generally tied to the legs of the chair, and additional ropes are sometimes used to keep the subject fully secure. A chair tie is occasionally combined with suspension bondage. ===Suspension bondage=== An example of suspension bondage at the Exxxotica Expo in 2013 === Hogtie === A woman who has been hogtied The subject is restrained at the wrists and ankles with all four joints converging together while the subject rests on either their back or (more commonly) stomach. ==See also== * Bondage positions and methods * Bondage rope harness * Human furniture * Metal bondage == References == Category:BDSM terminology Category:Decorative ropework ",
