    "text": "Yanko Daucik Ciboch (22 March 1941 \u2013 13 May 2017) was a Slovak professional footballer during the 1960s and 1970s. Yanko played for Real Betis, Real Madrid, the Toronto Falcons and RCD Espa\u00f1ol. Daucik is the son of Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, the veteran La Liga manager who moved with his family to Spain in 1950. Daucik made his La Liga debut for Real Betis on 11 September 1960 in a game against RCD Mallorca. His father was the Betis manager at the time. Yanko scored 14 goals in 38 La Liga appearances for Betis, attracting the interest of Real Madrid who signed him in 1962. However he faced stiff competition from the likes of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Francisco Gento, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s and Amancio Amaro and during two seasons at Real he only played 10 La Liga games and scored just 3 goals. He subsequently became one of the first Spanish footballers to play in North America when he played for Toronto Falcons of the National Professional Soccer League. This proved to something of a family reunion as Yanko was joined at the club by his father Ferdinand, brother-in- law Ladislao Kubala and nephew Branko Kubala. During the 1967 season Yanko played 17 games, scored 20 goals and made 8 assists for the Falcons and finished as the top scorer in the league.http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/D/Daucik.Yanko.htm Daucik died on May 13, 2017 in Madrid at the age of 76. ==Sources== * La Liga site * * Real Madrid veterans * nasljerseys.com ==References== ==External links== * Toronto Falcons stats Category:1941 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Slovak footballers Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to Spain Category:Spanish footballers Category:UD Salamanca players Category:Real Betis players Category:Real Madrid CF players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:UD Melilla footballers Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Rayo Vallecano players Category:UE Sant Andreu footballers Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Xerez CD footballers Category:La Liga players Category:National Professional Soccer League (1967) players Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) players Category:Toronto Falcons (1967-68) players Category:SD Indautxu footballers Category:Association football forwards ",
