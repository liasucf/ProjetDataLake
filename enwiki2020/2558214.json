    "text": "Ima Robot is an American band based in Los Angeles, California, United States, that formed in the late 1990s. The band's song, \"Greenback Boogie\", is the main theme song of the USA Network legal drama series Suits. ==History== Ima Robot formed in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, the band signed with Virgin Records. The band's other original members were Timmy \"The Terror\" Anderson, Oliver \"Oligee\" Goldstein, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, and studio drummer Joey Waronker. Meldal-Johnsen and Waronker were sought-after musicians who had played with Beck before joining Ima Robot. On September 16, 2003, Ima Robot released their first full-length album, the self-titled Ima Robot. The album featured the singles \"Dynomite\" and \"Song #1\" (released in the UK only). In 2004, Waronker and \"Oligee\" left the band. Meldal-Johnsen followed in 2005, with former Oleander drummer Scott Devours. Tim Anderson's cousin, whom he had never met before Devours, auditioned and took over the drums. Filip Nikolic took over the bass and Andy Marlow started playing the keyboards. On September 12, 2006, they released their second album Monument to the Masses, which featured the singles \"Creeps Me Out\" and \"Lovers in Captivity\". In April 2007, the band won their independence from Virgin Records and continued to work unsigned under the management of Alexis Rivera of Echo Park Records. The song \"Gangster\" premiered on the band's MySpace on April 15, 2008, with its lyrics posted in a blog entry by the band. In 2010 the band announced the upcoming release of their new album, Another Man's Treasure, and released the song \"Ruthless\" on the Internet. Ebert remained frustrated with Virgin, saying in a 2016 interview with Transverso Media that, \"pretty unironically I ended up feeling like a robot by the end of the process because of the major label thing.\" During that period, they were being represented by the Werewolf Heart label. In June 2008, Lars Vognstrup joined the group, having previously played with Nikolic in the band Junior Senior. In 2009, Orpheo McCord (of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and of Fool's Gold), Jason \"ComputerJay\" Taylor, and Jonas Petri Megyessi joined the band. On January 6, 2011, the band played six songs live on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. This was the first time since Monument to the Masses tours that the new band lineup had played live. Ima Robot's B-side \"Greenback Boogie\" from the album Another Man's Treasure has been featured as the theme song of the USA Network legal drama, Suits, since 2011. The band has been inactive since 2011 as its members have been busy with side projects. Alex Ebert has stated that he is \"still in Ima Robot.\" ==Band members== ===Current=== * Alex Ebert \u2013 lead vocals (1998\u2013Present) * Timmy \"The Terror\" Anderson \u2013 guitar (1998\u2013Present) * Filip \"Turbotito\" Nikolic \u2013 bass guitar (2004\u2013Present) * Jason \"Computer Jay\" Taylor \u2013 keyboards (2009\u2013Present) * Jonas Petri Megyessi \u2013 guitar, percussion (2009\u2013Present) * Orpheo McCord \u2013 drums (2009\u2013Present) ===Past=== * Joey Waronker \u2013 drums (1998\u20132004) * Oliver \"Oligee\" Goldstein \u2013 keyboard, guitar (1998\u20132004) * Justin Meldal-Johnsen \u2013 bass guitar (1998\u20132004) * Scott Devours \u2013 drums (2005\u20132009) * Andy Marlow \u2013 keyboards, (2005\u20132007) * Lars Vognstrup \u2013 keyboards, (2008\u20132009) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Ima Robot (September 16, 2003) * Monument to the Masses (September 12, 2006) * Another Man's Treasure (October 19, 2010) ===EPs=== * Untitled Demo Tape (1999) - Featuring the tracks Weirdest Girl and Sink or Swim * \"Very Not OK, Underdogs, Drowse\" (Demo CD) (1999) - Featuring the tracks Evil Thoughts, Climaxing, Ballad of Self Indulgence, Reaching 4 A Star, and I Am the Son * Untitled Demo CD (1999) - Featuring the tracks Sheela Fades, Electric Chair, and Pink Monkey as well as the tracks from Very Not OK, Underdogs, Drowse * \"Black Jettas\" (LP) (June 19, 2003) * \"Public Access EP\" (CD/LP) (June 20, 2003) * \"Song #1\" (EP) \u2013 (March 22, 2004) * \"Alive\" (EP) \u2013 (2004) \u2013 Radio Only * \"Search And Destroy\" (EP) (2006) \u2013 Sold only at shows originally and came free with the purchase of \"Another Man's Treasure\" from the band's website in 2010. ===Singles=== * \"Dynomite\" (Maxi Single) (CD/LP) (September, 2003) * \"Creeps Me Out\" (June 13, 2006) \u2013 Digital Only * \"Gangster\" (April 15, 2008) \u2013 Digital Only * \"Ruthless\" (June, 2010) \u2013 Digital Only ==References== ==External links== * Official PureVolume Category:Virgin Records artists Category:American power pop groups Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Rock music groups from California Category:Dance-rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1998 ",
