The solar radius is usually defined as the radius to the layer in the Sun's photosphere where the optical depth equals 2/3: :1\\,R_{\\odot} = 6.957\\times 10^5 \\hbox{ km} is approximately 10 times the average radius of Jupiter, about 109 times the radius of the Earth, and 1/215th of an astronomical unit, the distance of the Earth from the Sun. It varies slightly from pole to equator due to its rotation, which induces an oblateness in the order of 10 parts per million.NASA RHESSI oblateness measurements 2012 ==Measurements== Evolution of the solar luminosity, radius and effective temperature compared to the present-day Sun. After Ribas (2009) The unmanned SOHO spacecraft was used to measure the radius of the Sun by timing transits of Mercury across the surface during 2003 and 2006. The result was a measured radius of . Haberreiter, Schmutz & Kosovichev (2008) determined the radius corresponding to the solar photosphere to be . This new value is consistent with helioseismic estimates; the same study showed that previous estimates using inflection point methods had been overestimated by approximately . == Nominal solar radius == In 2015, the International Astronomical Union passed Resolution B3, which defined a set of nominal conversion constants for stellar and planetary astronomy. Resolution B3 defined the nominal solar radius (symbol R^{N}_{\\odot}) to be equal to exactly . The nominal values were adopted to help astronomers avoid confusion when quoting stellar radii in units of the Sun's radius, even when future observations will likely refine the Sun's actual photospheric radius (which is currently only known to about an accuracy of \u00b1). ==Examples== Solar radii as a unit are common when describing spacecraft moving close to the sun.
