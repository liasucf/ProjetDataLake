They are chiefly used in commuter service to the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris, serving the northwest Paris suburbs. Seventy-five of these 4-car units built for use on suburban service in the west of Paris, operating mainly on the Transilien Line L. The 4-car units are most often used in double-formation as 8-car sets. 43 sets have doors arranged for high platforms, while the remainder are for low platforms.
