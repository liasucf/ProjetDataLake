This article lists the leaders of the TBVC states, the four Bantustans which were declared nominally independent by the government of the Republic of South Africa during the period of apartheid, which lasted from 1948 to 1994. Their independence was not recognized outside South Africa. The bantustans with nominal independence were namely: Transkei (1976The Status of Transkei Act 100 of 1976 granted Transkei \"independence\" with effect from 26 October 1976.), Bophuthatswana (1977The Status of Bophuthatswana Act 89 of 1977 granted Bophuthatswana \"independence\" with effect from 6 December 1977.), Venda (1979The Status of Venda Act 107 of 1979 granted Venda \"independence\" with effect from 13 September 1979.) and Ciskei (1981The Status of Ciskei Act 110 of 1981 granted Ciskei \"independence\" with effect from 4 December 1981.), hence the abbreviation TBVC. The TBVC states were reintegrated into South Africa after the first post-apartheid general election in 1994.All Bantustans (both nominally independent and self-governing) were dismantled and their territories reincorporated into South Africa with effect from 27 April 1994, in terms of section 1(2) and Schedule 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993, the so-called \"Interim Constitution\" which abolished apartheid in South Africa. The text of this Interim Constitution, which came into force on 27 April 1994, coinciding with the beginning of the first democratic elections, is available online at Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 as of 27 April 1994. ==List== ===Transkei=== Map of Transkei (red) within South Africa.
