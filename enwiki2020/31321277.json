At 21 she set up Screen Artists, a film development and production company with business and personal partner Stavros Kazantzidis. Her screen career started soon after graduating from UTS with a Bachelor of Business in 1998, when she took a production job on Strange Planet (1999) starring Naomi Watts, and fell in love with filmmaking. A year later, she produced and penned her debut feature film Russian Doll (2000) starring Hugo Weaving (The Matrix).
