    "text": "Snake in the Eagle's Shadow () is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts action-comedy film directed by Yuen Woo-ping in his directorial debut. It stars Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang Lee, and Yuen Woo-ping's real life father, Yuen Siu Tien. Right after this film, Yuen Woo-ping directed Drunken Master, released in the same year, which also starred Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang Lee and Yuen Siu Tien. It followed a similar comedy kung fu film style. ==Plot== Chien Fu (Jackie Chan), an orphan adopted by a kung fu school, is overworked as their janitor and abused by the kung fu teachers as a walking punching-bag, with the school's cook, Ah-Wu (Tino Wong), being his only sympathizer. Chien befriends an old beggar (Yuen Siu Tien) by offering him a meal and a place to stay. Unknown to Chien, the old beggar is actually Pai Cheng-Tien, one of the last surviving masters of the Snake-style of kung fu. Pai is on the run from the Eagle Claw clan, which is viciously killing off all of the rival Snake-style masters, but is ambushed by Eagle Claw student Su Chen and an assassin masquerading as a Christian missionary (Roy Horan), and is injured. After being abused once more, Chien later finds Pai and helps him recover. Pai agrees to give him more lessons, on the condition that he does not call him \"sifu\" (\"master\"), since they are friends. The real reason, however, is to keep Chien's connection with him secret from his pursuers. Chien practices the lessons and learns to avoid being hurt by the school's bumbling teachers. When the school is invaded by the Mantis school, to everyone's amazement Chien easily defeats their master using the snake style. Unfortunately, one of the passing wanderers who witnesses the fight is the high master of the Eagle Clan, Sheng Kuan (Jang Lee Hwang), who recognizes the style at once and decides to tail Chien. Chien meets Shang Kuan, who inquires about the old beggar, claiming that he was a colleague of Pai's. As a show of 'proof', he easily fends off Chien's attacks. Chien realises that his Snake-style fighting is no match for the style practiced by the stranger, and thus creates a new style from watching his pet cat kill a cobra. Later on the Eagle Claw conspirators track down Pai, who manages to kill Su Chen. He returns to Chien for hiding, but it is then shown that Ah-Wu is also an Eagle Claw conspirator as he puts poison into their tea. Chien rushes to fetch Sheng Kuan, but sensing danger, Pai flees, with his enemy in pursuit. As Chien hurries after them, he finally learns the truth behind the conspiracy, and eventually challenges Sheng Kuan to single combat after Pai is brought down. Apparently at a disadvantage in the initial phase, Chien brings his new 'Cat Claw' technique\u2014against which Sheng Kuan knows no defense\u2014to bear, killing him. When Ah-Wu shows up after the fight and reveals his true allegiance, Chien and Pai trick and slay him, as they have by chance avoided ingesting the poison. Afterwards, the two friends wander off to refine Chien's new technique, giving it its titular name. ==Cast== * Jackie Chan \u2013 Chien Fu (as Cheng Lung) * Hwang Jang Lee \u2013 Sheng Kuan * Yuen Siu Tien \u2013 Pai Chang-tien (as Simon Yuen) * Dean Shek \u2013 Teacher Li * Fung Hak-on \u2013 Master Chao Chi-chih * Tino Wong \u2013 Ah-Wu * Peter Chan \u2013 Teacher Lian * Hsu Hsia \u2013 Su Chen * Charlie Chan \u2013 Master Hung * Roy Horan \u2013 Missionary/Russian * Fung Ging-man \u2013 Teacher Chui * Chiang Kam \u2013 Ah Kwai * Yao Lin Chen \u2013 Master Hung * Chen Tien Lung \u2013 Three Provinces Champ * Chan Lung \u2013 Substitute Instructor * Gam Yam \u2013 Chang * Yuen Yat-choh * Chiu Chi-ling * Choi Fai * Chan Laap-ban ==Crew== * Producer: Ng See-yuen * Executive Producer: Chang Chuan * Screenplay by: Hsi Hua-an, Tsai Chi-kuang, Ng See-yuen * Asst.

Fighting Instructors: Yuen Chen-wei, Yuan Hsin-yi, Yuan Kuei * Director: Yuen Woo-ping ==Production== Prior to Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, Chan had worked for director Lo Wei who wanted to make him into the new \"Bruce Lee\" in films like New Fist of Fury. However, those films yielded relatively poor box office returns. When producer Ng See-yuen decided to make a comedy with Chan as the star, the concept did not initially meet with approval from the film distributors. However, Ng and Chan persevered and together with Drunken Master, this film launched Jackie Chan into national stardom. The combination of comedy, martial arts, stunts and acrobatics had been done before, in Lau Kar-leung's 1975 film Spiritual Boxer. However, the release of Snake in the Eagle's Shadow heralded a new direction for Hong Kong action movies. Ng See- Yuen and Yuen Woo-ping checked over many actors for the part of the old, eccentric, wandering Kung Fu master, before Ng suggested casting Yuen's own father, Yuen Siu Tien. Yuen would continue to reprise the role of Beggar So several more times before his death in 1979. According to his book I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action, Chan lost a tooth after Hwang Jang Lee kicked him in the face during a fight scene. His arm was also accidentally slashed by a sword that was supposed to be blunt, but while he was screaming in pain, the camera kept rolling. ==Music== As well as original music by Chou Fu-liang, the film also features Jean Michel Jarre's \"Oxyg\u00e8ne (Part 2)\" and Space's \"Magic Fly\". Like many Hong Kong movies of the era, it also includes samples from western movie scores, including You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me, Carrie, and Star Wars. Film producer Serafim Karalexis got the rights to distribute the movie in America in the 80s, retitled \"The Eagle's Shadow\". It had a new score made due to copyright issues with the original score. The U.S. film and its promotional materials billed Chan as \"Jacky Chan.\" ==Box office== At the Hong Kong box office, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow earned HK$2,708,748.20 (), becoming the 13th top-grossing film of the year. In South Korea, it was the second highest-grossing film of 1979 (behind Jackie Chan's Drunken Master), with 765,930 box admissions in Seoul, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately million (). Combined, the film grossed an estimated total of approximately in East Asia, equivalent to adjusted for inflation. ==Sequel== In 1979, a film entitled Snake in the Eagle's Shadow II aka Snaky Knight Fight Against Mantis (or Snaky Knight Fights the Mantis) was released. It was directed by Chang Hsin-yi and starred Wang Tao. However, the film was not a true sequel, rather it was an attempt by the studio to capitalise on the success of the original film. Footage including a montage and a fight scene from Snake in the Eagle's Shadow were spliced into the film. Chan's image was also used on the cover of some versions. ==DVD versions== *On 7 February 2000, Hong Kong Legends released a DVD containing a number of extras, including a photo gallery, Jackie Chan and Hwang Jang Lee's biographies/filmographies, the English export trailer, and an interview with producer Ng See-yuen. However, it contains a cropped 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 image and the incorrect Mandarin dub with dubtitles. This DVD contains compulsory BBFC cuts amounting to roughly 45 seconds due to animal cruelty. The Chinese credit sequence is used (reverting to 2:35:1 during this section). The English dub is one created by US studios during the film's release there (under the title \"The Eagle's Shadow\") to avoid copyright issues with music, but everything else is the same as the export dub commissioned by Seasonal Films. *On 18 June 2002, Destination Films released the first legal DVD in the United States. Despite having uncut status and a full 2:35:1 image in the correct Cantonese language, it still contains dubtitles. The English dub (and credit sequence) is the export one and intact. *On 16 February 2004, Mei Ah Entertainment released a remastered DVD in Hong Kong. It has uncut 2:35:1 anamorphic video. Audio include Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1, Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono and Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono. Subtitles include Traditional, Simplified Chinese and English. Special features are limited to Cast and Crew Info and Synopsis. ==See also== * Jackie Chan filmography * List of Hong Kong films * List of martial arts films ==References== ==External links== * * * *Hong Kong Cinemagic Category:1978 films Category:1978 martial arts films Category:1970s action comedy films Category:1970s martial arts comedy films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Films directed by Yuen Woo-ping Category:Hong Kong films Category:Hong Kong action comedy films Category:Hong Kong martial arts comedy films Category:Kung fu films Category:Slapstick films Category:Wushu films Category:1978 directorial debut films Category:1978 comedy films ",
