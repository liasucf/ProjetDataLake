It was also released in Europe as The World of Maynard Ferguson (but with the sides reversed) \u2014 not to be confused with the Roulette compilation with the same title. His first record for CBS (The Ballad Style of Maynard Ferguson) was filled with easy listening/pop recordings, but this would be Maynard's first foray into the world of rock music. His recording of \"MacArthur Park\" would prove very popular with his fans, and would be a concert staple for many years. ==Reissues== In 2005, M.F.
