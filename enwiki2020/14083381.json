Virtually all modern military tanks use them, an early example being the M26 Pershing and Chieftain, and many other military vehicles as well. ==Advantages== The modularity is what makes a powerpack powertrain different from other types; using the term powerpack implies that the whole unit can be easily removed or separated from the rest of the machine, allowing it to be rapidly replaced by another powerpack while the original is repaired or disposed of, and minimizing the amount of time that the entire machine is out of use. Even in cases where the powerpack is not being replaced, being able to remove it can make repairs easier and faster. == See also == * Prime mover * Power-egg * Power module ==References== Category:Engine technology ",
