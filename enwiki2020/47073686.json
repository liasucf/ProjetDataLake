    "text": "Ankylopoda is a clade that contains turtles and lepidosaurs (Tuatara, lizards and snakes) and their fossil relatives. This clade is supported based on microRNAs as well as the fossil record. Stem-turtles and lepidosaurs have unique skull elements and features not seen in archosaurs (represented by extant crocodilians and birds). ==Classification== The cladogram below follows the most likely result found by another analysis of turtle relationships, this one using only fossil evidence, published by Rainer Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. This study found Eunotosaurus to be an actual early stem-turtle, though other versions of the analysis found weak support for it as a parareptile. ==See also== Archelosauria, an alternative clade that places turtles as sister taxon to archosaurs. ==References== Category:Reptile taxonomy ",
