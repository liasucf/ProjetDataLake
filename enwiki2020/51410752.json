This was the nation's third time competing at a Paralympic Games since it became independent from its federation with Serbia in June 2006. Montenegro was represented by two athletes in Rio de Janeiro: shot putter and discus thrower Marijana Goranovi\u0107 and short-distance swimmer Ilija Tadi\u0107. Goranovi\u0107 competed in two events in field and her best finish was in the women's shot put F41 competition, where she came eighth. Tadi\u0107 took part in two swimming events and his best performance was in the men's 50 metre freestyle S9 tournament, where he placed 14th overall and did not advance to the final. ==Background== Montenegro became an independent country from its federation with Serbia on 3 June 2006 after a referendum on Montenegrin independence the month before. The country made its debut at the 2008 Beijing Summer Paralympic Games, and have appeared in every Summer Paralympics since, making Rio de Janeiro its third appearance at a Summer Paralympiad as an independent nation.

The Paralympic Committee of Montenegro sent two athletes to compete at the Rio Paralympics: shot putter and discus thrower Marijana Goranovi\u0107 and Ilija Tadi\u0107, a short-distance swimmer. Tadi\u0107 was selected to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. ==Disability classifications== Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Athletics== At the time of the Rio Paralympics, Marijana Goranovi\u0107 was 27 years old. She was competing in her second Paralympic Games, having previously represented Montenegro at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Goranovi\u0107's disability is congenital; she is a person of short stature and is classified as F41. She qualified for the Rio Games by meeting the \"A\" qualifying standards for the women's shot put and discus throw events at a meeting in the Montenegrin town of Bar in April 2016. This was officially confirmed by the International Paralympic Committee on 30 June. Before the Paralympics, Goranovi\u0107 said, \"I had enough time to recover after throwing the ball, I felt the terrain and the atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium, I have done two training sessions, and I've thrown over 20 meters, and I hope to repeat it when it's needed the most.\" On 9 September, she competed in the women's shout put F41, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, with a mark of 6.57 metres. Six days later, Goranovi\u0107 participated in the discus throw F40\u201341.
