Abilene zoo has been an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1985. The zoo participates in the AZA Reciprocal Admissions Program, allowing members to obtain free or reduced admissions at many other American zoos. The zoo is primarily funded by the City of Abilene and the Abilene Zoological Society. ==History== Zoo's entrance black rhinos In 1985, the zoo first received accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). In 2006, $1.1 million was raised through a bond issue for zoo improvements. This bond funded converting part of the Discovery Center into the Creepy Crawly Center, expansions to the giraffe exhibit and the parking lot, and creating a South American Trails exhibit, the Wetlands Boardwalk, and the Elm Creek Backyard exhibit. In 2007, one of the zoos elephants died at age 49 amidst some controversy over conditions for the elephants at the zoo, and the other was sent to the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas. The elephant exhibit was then turned into an exhibit for black rhinoceroses. The new $3.7 million Adventure Center (visitor services, administration, and education, all privately funded) and the new Creepy Crawler Center were also opened in 2007. In 2008, the zoo saw the opening of the maned wolf exhibit, which was initially home to a mother and son acquired from the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center in Eureka, Missouri. In June 2009, the zoo received an 8 year old white Bengal tiger named Havar from Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Florida. The 325 pound male tiger went on display 2 June 2009. Also in 2009, the Elm Creek Backyard exhibit was completed with funds from the 2006 bond issue plus a $525,000 grant from the Grover Nelson Foundation. In 2013, a new Caribbean Cove section opened, featuring exotic birds, reptiles, and mammals from Caribbean countries. In March 2009, extension of the AZA accreditation for the zoo was tabled. In November, the majority of the issues had been addressed, including the lack of adequate veterinary and quarantine facilities. In March 2010, the zoo's accreditation was extended through 2014. In March 2014, the AZA once granted accreditation without any reservations. ==Exhibits== ===Giraffe Safari=== This exhibit includes a bridge crossing over it which allows visitors to pet and feed the giraffes.
