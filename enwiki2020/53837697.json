He announced his retirement from professional tennis in 2009. A former hitting partner for good friend Kim Clijsters, Wauters was also briefly the coach of Yanina Wickmayer, for the second half of 2013. ==Challenger titles== ===Doubles: (2)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:220px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Partner !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1. |2005 |Montauban, France |Clay | Steve Darcis | Gabriel Trujillo Soler Lovro Zovko |6\u20134, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20134 |- |2. |2006 |Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herzegovina |Clay | Joseph Sirianni | Ivan Dodig Aleksandar Mari\u0107 |6\u20134, 3\u20136, 10\u20134 |} ==See also== *List of Belgium Davis Cup team representatives ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian male tennis players Category:Belgian tennis coaches Category:People from Sint-Niklaas Category:Sportspeople from East Flanders ",
