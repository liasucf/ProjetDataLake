It was the second volume in the David S. Ware Archive Series, after the expanded reissue of Birth of a Being.Live in Sant'Anna Arresi, 2004 at AUM Fidelity ==Reception== The All About Jazz review by Karl Ackermann says \"we have unconstrained improvisation, sensibly executed with neither excess nor self-imposed limitation. Both Ware and Shipp effect knotty, non-linear phrases only to break off in unexpected directions.\"Ackermann, Karl. Live in Sant'Anna Arresi, 2004 review at All About Jazz In a review for Down Beat, Bill Meyer notes \"Shipp spends considerable time under his piano\u2019s lid, creating otherworldly bursts of pure, fragile sound that contrast most productively with Ware\u2019s fiery blowing.\"Meyer, Bill. Live in Sant'Anna Arresi, 2004 review. Down Beat January 17: page 71. Print. The Point of Departure review by Chris Robinson states \"Ware and Matthew Shipp played a forty minute improvised duo set that is stunning in its urgency, vitality, virtuosity, and coherence as a large scale work.\"Robinson, Chris.
