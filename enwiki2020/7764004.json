His family was poor and he had no formal schooling, but he was self- educated. At age 15, he took a job as a newspaper boy in New York. Several years later, he moved to Philadelphia and became an editor for the Daily Chronicle. In 1830, he published the first edition of the Lady's Book, composed of reprinted articles and illustrations from French magazines. Godey married Maria Duke in 1833 and had five children. Godey hired Sarah Josepha Hale to be editor of Godey's Lady's Book in 1837. She remained the editor until her retirement in 1877.Oberholtzer, Ellis Paxson.
