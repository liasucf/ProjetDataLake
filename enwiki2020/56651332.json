    "text": "ONAP, or the Open Network Automation Platform, is an open source networking project hosted by the Linux Foundation. On February 23, 2017, ONAP was announced as a result of a merger of the OpenECOMP and Open-Orchestrator (Open-O) projects. The goal of the project is to develop a widely used platform for orchestrating and automating physical and virtual network elements, with full lifecycle management. == History == ONAP was formed as a merger of OpenECOMP, the open source version of AT&T;'s ECOMP project, and the Open-Orchestrator project, a project begun under the aegis of the Linux Foundation with China Mobile, Huawei and ZTE as lead contributors. The merger brought together both sets of source code and their developer communities, who then elaborated a common architecture for the new project. Other contributors included IBM, Amdocs, Bell Canada, Intel, Orange, and more. ONAP incorporates or is evaluating collaboration with other open source projects, including OpenDaylight, FD.io, OPNFV and others. The first release of the combined ONAP architecture, code named \"Amsterdam\", was announced on November 20, 2017. The next release (\"Beijing\") was released on June 12, 2018. As of January, 2018, ONAP became a project within the LF Networking Fund, which consolidated membership across multiple projects into a common governance structure. Most ONAP members became members of the new LF Networking fund. == Overview == ONAP provides a platform for real-time, policy-driven orchestration and automation of physical and virtual network functions that will enable software, network, IT and cloud providers and developers to rapidly automate new services and support complete lifecycle management. It consists of both design-time (on- boarding new types services and Virtual Network Functions (VNF) and Physical Network Functions (PNF)) and run-time (creating and managing instances of services, VNFs, PNFs). == References == == External links == * Category:Computer networking Category:Linux Foundation projects ",
