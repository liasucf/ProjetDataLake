    "text": "Dreadful Tales (2000) is a collection of short horror stories by American cult writer Richard Laymon. Published the year before his death it collects twenty- five stories, most previously published in magazines. ==Stories (in order of arrangement)== #Invitation to Murder #The Grab #Saving Grace #Barney's Bigfoot Museum #Herman #The Champion #The Maiden #A Good Cigar is a Smoke #I'm not a Criminal #Oscar's Audition #Into the Pit #Spooked #The Good Deed #The Direct Approach #Good Vibrations #Phil the Vampire #Paying Joe Back #The Fur Coat #Blarney #Dracuson's Driver #Roadside Pickup #Wishbone #First Date #Stickman #Mop Up ==Reception== The collection received positive notices from the horror community, including Shivers, which said that it \"knocks all other offerings for six and presents a consistent collection of tales, almost every one of which manages to shock, delight and horrify through numerous ideas, characters and situations... a breath of fresh air in the stale UK Horror climate... Gets my vote as the best of 2000 by a long chalk.\" (Although Laymon was an American writer, throughout his career his books were more popular in the United Kingdom, a fact he blamed on a botched, heavily-edited American release of his second novel, The Woods Are Dark.) Books Magazine called it a \"terrifying collection of short stories that showcases the dark genius of a true master of the macabre.\"Amazon listing for Dreadful Tales ==References== Category:Horror fiction Category:Novels by Richard Laymon ",
