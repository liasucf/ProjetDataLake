Exhaust was not expelled through a funnel, like most ships, but through vents below the waterline. The patrol boat could reach a maximum speed of , and had a maximum range of at . The ship's company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machineguns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime after 1988. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin- mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 88Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 222 Gawler was laid down by the North Queensland Engineers and Agents at Cairns, Queensland on 18 January 1982, launched on 9 July 1983, and commissioned into the RAN on 27 August 1983.Moore, Jane's Fighting Ships 1985\u201386, p. 26 ==Operational history== ==Fate== Gawler was decommissioned at HMAS Coonawarra on 8 July 2006. The patrol boat was broken up for scrap in Darwin during 2006 and 2007, at a cost of $450,000 to the Australian government. ==Citations== ==References== * * * ** The chapter is available separately as Semaphore, Issue 17, 2005 in PDF and HTML formats. * * Category:Fremantle-class patrol boats Category:Ships built in Queensland Category:1983 ships ",
