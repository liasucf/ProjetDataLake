Following script writing for Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of British Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, he wrote several successful Hindi songs for films. These have included \"Galliyan\", \"Tere Sang Yaara\", \"Kaun Tujhe\", \"Dil Meri Na Sune\", \"Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga\" and \"Teri Mitti\". He wrote the Hindi scripts for the dubbed productions of the Telugu film Baahubali 2 and was subsequently commissioned to do the same for the Hollywood production of Black Panther. Manoj Muntashir was born on 27 February 1976 as Manoj Shukla into a farming family in Gauriganj, Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, India, where he attended a convent school. After graduating from Allahabad University in 1999 he moved to Mumbai to seek work, and subsequently entered the TV and film scene following an opportunity given to him by Amitabh Bachan to write for Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of British Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Muntashir has written the lyrics of several Hindi film songs including \"Galliyan\" from Ek Villain, \"Tere Sang Yaara\" from Rustom, \"Kaun Tujhe\" from M.S Dhoni: The Untold Story and \"Dil Meri Na Sune\" from the film \"Genius\". He has frequently voiced concerns with regards to acknowledgments to song and script writers. His lyrics to \"Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga\"(2017), a song which registered more than four million views through unofficial versions prior to its official release, were originally compiled for his wife in 2001. When he failed to receive acknowledgement for the song, he voiced that he didn't \"know why certain people can't accept an age old fact that lyricists have an equal amount of contribution in making a song successful\". Following a nomination for the 2020 Filmfare award for best lyrics for the song 'Teri Mitti' from the 2019 film Kesari, he tweeted his disappointment when the award went to someone else. He has written scripts for India's Got Talent and Indian Idol Junior, and worked with other artists including Anu Malik, Amaal Mallik, Himesh Reshammiya and Sonu Nigam. Muntashir wrote the Hindi dialogues for Baahubali 2, dubbing the words in Hindi to match the lip movements which spoke in Telugu. Later, he was commissioned to do the same for the Hollywood film, Black Panther. His awards have included the Yash Bharti Award, the IIFA Awards and Radio Mirchi Music Awards. In 2019, he published a book titled Meri Fitrat Hai ==Awards and nominations== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ebf5ff;\" !Year !Category !Song/nomination !Result |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indian Telly Awards |- |2014 |Best Script | India's Got Talent | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|IIFA Awards |- |2015 |Best Lyrics | Galliyan \u2013Ek Villain | |- |2018 |Best Lyrics |Mere Rashke Qamar -Baadshaho | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Star Guild Award |- |2015 |Best Lyrics | Galliyan \u2013Ek Villain | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Hungama Surfers Choice Award |- |2015 |Best Lyrics | Galliyan \u2013Ek Villain | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Radio Mirchi Music Awards |- |2015 |Best Album | Ek Villain | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Arab Indo Bollywood Awards |- |2015 |Best Lyrics | Galliyan \u2013Ek Villain | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|The Indian Icon Film Awards |- |2015 |Best Lyrics | Galliyan \u2013Ek Villain | |- |2016 |Best Lyrics | Tere Sang Yara \u2013Rustom | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Uttar Pradesh Gauraw Samman |- |2016 |Best Lyricist | | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Yash Bharti Award |- |2016 |State Honor (Uttar Pradesh) |Highest State Honor | |- style=\"background:#bfd7ff;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Mirchi Music Awards |- |rowspan=3 | 2014 | Lyricist of The Year | \"Galliyan\" from Ek Villain |rowspan=2 |- |Album of The Year |rowspan=2 | Ek Villain |- | Listeners' Choice Album of the Year | |- | 2016 | Album of The Year | Kapoor & Sons | |} == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- style=\"background:#cccccf; text-align:center;\" | Year||Title || Number of songs || Record label|| Composer |- |rowspan=\"5\"|2019 |Hume Tumse Pyaar Kitna |rowspan=\"4\"|1 |T-Series |Jeet Gannguli |- |Kesari |Zee Music Company |Arko Pravo Mukherjee |- |Kabir Singh |rowspan=\"5\"|T-Series |rowspan=\"2\"|Vishal Mishra |- |Notebook |- |Why Cheat India |rowspan=\"3\"|2 |Rochak Kohli |- |rowspan=\"9\"|2018 |Loveyatri |Tanishk Bagchi |- |Batti Gul Meter Chalu |Rochak Kohli |- |Genius |3 |Tips Music |Himesh Reshammiya |- |Humnava Mere (Single) |rowspan=\"3\"|1 |rowspan=\"8\"|T-series |Rocky-Shiv |- |Gal Sun (Single) |Akhil Sachdeva |- |Oh Humsafar (Single) |Tony Kakkar |- |Raid | 2 |Tanishk Bagchi |- |Hate Story 4 |rowspan=\"3\"|3 |Mithoon, Arko, Tanishk Bagchi |- |Aiyaary |Rochak Kohli, Ankit Tiwari |- |rowspan=\"6\"|2017 || Naam Shabana || Rochak Kohli, Meet Bros |- |Baadshaho |6 |Tanishk Bagchi, Ankit Tiwari, Abhijit Bhagani |- || Baahubali 2: The Conclusion || 5 || Lahari Music & T Series (Telugu & Tamil) Zee Music Company (Hindi) Manorama Music (Malayalam) || M.
