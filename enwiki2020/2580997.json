Adjoining the Frogmore Estate was the York Estate, originally owned by the York family. When it was subdivided in the late 1880s, the land was mainly sold for orchards and vineyards. By the early 1900s a rural community had established in the area and a village developed. The Mount Hope Methodist Church was built in 1904 and the York Estate Public School was built in 1910.
