    "text": "A pie shop is a take away (fast food) outlet specialising in pies, especially meat pies. Common in some parts of the United Kingdom and Australia. A form of specialised bakery, or in more recent times purely a retail outlet selling reheated cooked pies, pie shops in Australia usually sell meat pies, sausage rolls, pasties and other pastry-wrapped baked goods. The growth of hot bread shops (direct sale bakeries, often franchises) in Australia has largely supplanted the specialist pie shop. == See also == * Square Pie ==References== Category:Food retailing Category:Pies ",
