Her favored subjects were landscapes, floral still-lifes and scenes of people at work or attending events. ==Biography== Her father was a secondary school teacher and her uncle was Bishop Nicolae Popea. Upon finishing her basic education, she studied philology in Leipzig and painting in Berlin. Later, she enrolled at the M\u00fcnchner K\u00fcnstlerinnenverein, an art school for women in Munich. After that, she spent some time at the artists' colony in Landsberg am Lech, where she took private lessons from Angelo Jank and .*\"Expozi\u021bia retrospectiv\u0103 Elena Popea\", 24 September - 14 November 2010\", Muzeul de Art\u0103 Bra\u0219ov, with brief biography. Her d\u00e9but came in 1905 at the \"Expozi\u021bia na\u021bional\u0103\", organized by the Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n (ASTRA), in Sibiu. More exhibitions followed in Bucharest and Cluj. During World War I, she lived in Paris, where she had showings at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and the Salon des ind\u00e9pendants. While there, she continued her studies with Lucien Simon. In 1922, she returned to Paris to study with Andr\u00e9 Lhote at his new academy in Montparnasse. She generally spent her summers painting in the vicinity of Bra\u0219ov or Cluj, and the rest of the year travelling; wandering as far afield as Scandinavia, Scotland, Spain and the Middle East, with each trip resulting in a new series of canvases. ==Selected paintings== Elena Popea - Targ in Ardeal.png|Fair in Transylvania Elena Popea - Interior din castelul Bran1.png|Interior of Bran Castle Elena Popea - Femeie cu capra.png|Woman with Goat Elena Popea - Barci.png|Boats ==References== ==Further reading== *Maria Dumitrescu, Elena Popea, Editura Meridiane, 1969. *Maria Chira and Gheorghe M\u00e2ndrescu, Elena Popea: 1879-1941 : expozit\u012fa retrospectiv\u0103 (exhibition catalog) Cluj-Napoca Muzeul de Art\u0103, 1975. *Radu Popica, Pavel \u0218u\u0219ar\u01ce, Iulia Mesea, Elena Popea, Editura Muzeului de Art\u0103 Bra\u0219ov 2010, Online ==External links== Category:1879 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Bra\u0219ov Category:Romanian Austro-Hungarians Category:Cubist artists Category:20th-century Romanian painters Category:Romanian women artists Category:20th-century women artists ",
