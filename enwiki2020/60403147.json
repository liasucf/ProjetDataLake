Retrieved 3 April 2019 was a British radio DJ and announcer, best known for his work at Radio Luxembourg. ==Biography== Stewart was born in Liverpool. After national service, his friend Pete Best suggested that he become a DJ. He worked at Radio Caroline, transferring from Caroline South to Caroline North, and adopting a mid-Atlantic accent because of fears that his Scouse accent might alienate some listeners. In 1969, he joined Radio Luxembourg, and, with a distinctive and powerful voice, became one of the key presenters on the station, sometimes credited as \"Baby\" Bob Stewart. The station's longest-serving presenter, he remained at Luxembourg for 18 years, and was best known as the host of country music and pop chart shows.
