    "text": "\"Water Runs Dry\" is a 1995 single by Boyz II Men for the Motown label, written and produced by Babyface. The single, the fourth released from the album II, reached number two in the United States and number four in the Canada. It also contains a version of the group's previous number one hit from the same album, \"I'll Make Love to You\". A Spanish version, \"No dejemos que muera el amor\", was also recorded and peaked at number 10 on the US Latin Pop Airplay chart. ==Music video== The video for the song was directed by Wayne Isham. Filmed at White Sands National Park in New Mexico, it features a woman (played by Tyra Banks) finding and holding a glass ball, in which the camera zooms in to reveal the band playing both on top of a mound of sand and at sunset, sometimes accompanied by a full string section. Several scenes feature a rippling effect, to mimic water. Banks is also seen running through the dunes throughout. The camera does a flyover atop the sand dunes before landing on the band. In the end, the camera zooms out to reveal Banks holding the glass ball again, this time with the band's silhouettes inside. ==Track listings== US Remixes # Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix Edit) 3:53 # Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix) 4:51 # Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix Edit) 4:10 # Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix) 4:44 # Water Runs Dry (LP Version) 3:21 US Maxi-CD # Water Runs Dry (LP Version) 3:21 # Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix) 4:43 # Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix) 4:51 # Water Runs Dry (Groove Mix) 4:30 # Water Runs Dry (Bump Mix) 4:38 US Vinyl, 12\", Promo *A1 Water Runs Dry (LP Version) 3:21 *A2 Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix) 4:43 *A3 Water Runs Dry (Instrumental) 3:21 *B1 Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix) 4:51 *B2 Water Runs Dry (Groove Mix) 4:30 *B3 Water Runs Dry (Acapella) 3:21 UK Maxi-CD # Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix Edit) 4:00 # Water Runs Dry (LP Version) 3:21 # Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix) 4:43 # Ill Make Love To You (Pop Edit) 3:49 UK Vinyl, 12\", Promo *A1 Water Runs Dry (Strat Mix) 3:21 *A2 Water Runs Dry (Mood Mix) 4:43 *A3 Water Runs Dry (Bump Mix) 3:21 *B1 Water Runs Dry (LP Version) 4:51 *B2 Water Runs Dry (Groove Mix) 4:30 *B3 I'll Make Love to You (I Wanna Make Love to You Version) 3:21 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |14 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Singles Sales (Billboard) |30 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |35 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |11 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |12 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|23 |} ==Certifications== ==Renditions== In 1998, contemporary jazz guitarist Chuck Loeb covered the song for his album The Moon, the Stars and the Setting Sun.
