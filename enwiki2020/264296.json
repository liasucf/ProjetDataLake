    "text": "Porno for Pyros was an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1992, following the break-up of Jane's Addiction. The band comprised former Jane's Addiction members Perry Farrell (vocals) and Stephen Perkins (drums), as well as Peter DiStefano (guitar) and Martyn LeNoble (bass). The band released two studio albums, Porno for Pyros (1993) and Good God's Urge (1996), before parting ways in 1998. ==History== Following the demise of the critically and commercially successful Jane's Addiction, frontman Perry Farrell and drummer Stephen Perkins formed Porno for Pyros after acquiring guitarist Peter DiStefano and bass player Martyn LeNoble. Farrell named the band after seeing an ad for fireworks in a pornographic magazine.Farley 1993 The name has also been connected through song lyrics to the LA riots which occurred in the band's hometown around the time of Porno for Pyros inception.Browne 1993 Prior to releasing their eponymous first album, Porno for Pyros embarked on a nationwide tour to support the new band. By the time the band's debut album was released in 1993, anticipation surrounding the project was enough to briefly drive the album to the No. 3 position on the Billboard top 200 list. The video for the album's second single, \"Pets\", received heavy airplay on MTV. Following the album's release, Porno for Pyros continued a heavy touring schedule, including an appearance at Woodstock '94 along with a cameo on HBO's The Larry Sanders Show. Unlike the relatively straight-ahead rock shows that were the hallmark of live Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros live shows relied heavily on props, extras and special effects (including pyrotechnics). For the band's follow-up album, Good God's Urge, bass player LeNoble quit after completing the majority of the bass tracks. Ex-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt was brought in to finish up the album tracks and join the band on tour. The album also featured the post-Jane's reunion of Farrell with guitarist Dave Navarro, who made a guest appearance on \"Freeway\", along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' bass player Flea. The band again set forth on a heavy touring schedule. On several tour stops Porno for Pyros played \"Mountain Song\", a popular Jane's Addiction tune, a foreshadowing of the later Jane's Addiction reunion efforts. Further touring by the band was scuttled when DiStefano was diagnosed with cancer. Perkins and Watt subsequently formed the jazz-punk improvisation group Banyan and, along with DiStefano, occasionally perform sets of Stooges cover versions in the Los Angeles area under the band name Hellride. ===Reunions=== In April 2009, the original lineup of Farrell, Perkins, DiStefano, and LeNoble performed at Farrell's 50th birthday party. In April 2011, Farrell wrote on his Twitter account: \"One day, more Porno For Pyros\", suggesting that the band will reunite in the future. On September 3, 2012, DiStefano stated that the band will be active in 2013, which was later also announced by Farrell on his Facebook page on July 6, 2013. Despite these hints, nothing has been heard since about the band or any sort of reunion. On July 27, 2020 it was announced that for the first time in 24 years, Porno for Pyros (featuring the lineup of Perry Farrell, Stephen Perkins, Mike Watt and Peter DiStefano) would be reuniting to play Lolla2020, a free four-night YouTube broadcast event taking place on the original dates of the 2020 Chicago-based Lollapalooza festival, Thursday, July 30 through Sunday, August 2. ==Members== *Perry Farrell \u2013 vocals, harmonica, tambourine (1992\u20131997, 2009, 2018\u2013present) *Stephen Perkins \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (1992\u20131997, 2009, 2018\u2013present) *Peter DiStefano \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (1992\u20131997, 2009, 2018\u2013present) *Martyn LeNoble \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1992\u20131996, 2009, 2018\u20132019) *Mike Watt \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1995\u20131997, 2020) ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications ! rowspan=\"2\" |Title ! rowspan=\"2\" |Album details ! colspan=\"7\" |Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" |Certifications |- !US !US Cash !Aus !NOR !NZ !SWE !UK |- !Porno for Pyros | * Released: April 27, 1993 * Label: Warner Bros. * Formats: CD, CS, LP, digital download |3 |1 |35 |\u2014 |16 |\u2014 |13 | * RIAA: Gold |- !Good God's Urge | * Released: May 28, 1996 * Label: Warner Bros. * Formats: CD, CS, LP, digital download |20 |29 |20 |18 |20 |57 |40 |\u2014 |- | colspan=\"11\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===Compilation albums=== *Rhino Hi-Five : Porno for Pyros (2007) ===Singles=== * \"Tahitian Moon\" (Single with two additional unreleased tracks) === Charting singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=\"2\" |Year !rowspan=\"2\" |Single !colspan=\"5\" |Peak chart positions !rowspan=\"2\" |Album |- !style=\"width:1em\"|U.S. !style=\"width:1em\"|U.S. Airplay !style=\"width:1em\"|U.S. Modern !style=\"width:1em\"|U.S. Mainstream !style=\"width:1em\"|U.K. |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1993 |\"Cursed Female\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 |rowspan=\"3\"|Porno for Pyros |- |\"Pets\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|67 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|67 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|53 |- |1994 |\"Sadness\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 |- |1996 |\"Tahitian Moon\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|8 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|34 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|\u2014 |Good God's Urge |- |1997 |\"Hard Charger\" | style=\"text- align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|23 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|\u2014 |Private Parts (Non-album single) |- !colspan=\"8\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes singles that did not chart. |} ===Music videos=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"52\"|Date !width=\"89\"|Title ! style=\"width:240px;\"|Director(s) ! style=\"width:251px;\"|Notes |- |May 1993 |\"Cursed Female\" |Melodie McDaniel |Prod co: Palomar Pictures; DP: Wyatt Troll (16 mm) |- |June 1993 |\"Pets\" |Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris |Producer: Bart Lipton; DP: Christophe Lanzenberg |- |November 1993 |\"Sadness\" |John Lindauer |Prod co: Chelsea Pictures; Producers: John Oetjen, Chris Wagoner, Keith Milton; DP: Eric Engler; Stylist: Kristine Miller; based on the performance art piece Four Scenes in a Harsh Life by Ron Athey (concept, co-director and featured actor) |- |May 1996 |\"Tahitian Moon\" |John Linson & Perry Farrell |Filmed in Tahiti. |- |October 1996 |\"100 Ways\" |Andrew Dosunmu (as Rusty James) |Prod co: Propaganda Films |- |February 1997 |\"Hard Charger\" |Liz Friedlander (as Alan Smithee) & Geoff Nelson |Prod co: DNA; Producer: Pete Chambers; Stylist: Gretchen Patch |} ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography *Browne, David. \"Burning Addiction\", Entertainment Weekly, May 7, 1993.
