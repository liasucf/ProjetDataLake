Later, he became a professor there and lectured in thermodynamics and internal combustion engines. In 1910, Seiliger developed the dual cycle, which was later named Seiliger cycle after him. After the Russian revolution, Seiliger left Russia; in October 1924, he moved to France, where he became a professor of the RWTI Paris and continued lecturing. Also, Seiliger was a member of the Society of Russian Engineers.James E.
