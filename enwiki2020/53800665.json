    "text": "Gerald Benney CBE (21 April 1930 \u2013 26 June 2008) was a British silver and goldsmith who along with David Mellor and Robert Welch popularised stainless steel designs in post-war British homes. Like Mellor and Welch he was influenced by modern Scandinavian design and in particular Georg Jensen. He was born in Hull and was the first British craftsperson to ever hold four Royal Warrants at the same time. The modern Scandinavian style Gerald developed was taught to him by Berger Bergensen. He was appointed CBE in the 1995 New Year Honours. His son Simon Benney (b. 1 January 1966) now runs the business and is also now recognised himself as one of the leading designers in the world. == References == Category:1930 births Category:2008 deaths Category:British silversmiths Category:British goldsmiths Category:English silversmiths Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ",
