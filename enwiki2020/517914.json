    "text": "Nailsworth is a town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, lying in one of the Stroud Valleys in the Cotswolds, on the A46 road, south of Stroud and about north-east of Bristol and Bath. The parish had a population of 5,794 at the 2011 census. ==History== Nailsworth in ancient times was a settlement at the confluence of the Avening Valley and the Woodchester Valley, on the Nailsworth Stream. Among many notable historic medieval buildings in the area are Beverston Castle and Owlpen Manor. In the modern era, Nailsworth was a small mill town and centre for brewing. It was connected directly to the UK national rail network between 1867 and 1947, as the terminus of the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway. ==Amenities== These days Nailsworth is visited in the summer by walkers. It holds a farmers' market every fourth Saturday in the month. Local events such as the market and the Nailsworth Festival are still announced by a town crier.Community site.

Nailsworth is a Fairtrade Town and twinned with the French town of L\u00e8ves, with which it enjoys an exchange visit in alternate years. ==St George's Church== The entrance to St George's Church Built on the higher ground at the centre of town, St George's was consecrated in November 1900. Before 1895, the Church of England had provided for Nailsworth through several neighbouring parishes.Anglican Nailsworth. Retrieved 4 February 2019. The new church, which today can seat 500, was designed in the Early English style by M. H. Medland of Gloucester. A lack of funds, however, meant that the church originally consisted only of a nave, aisles and south porch, without a chancel or tower. The large entrance was originally designed as a tower, but the elevated ground was considered too unstable to support the weight, resulting in the unusual porch. The clock tower was constructed on the steep grass bank by the church, known as the clock on stilts, before finding its final resting place some yards away, by the present-day Nailsworth roundabout. At that time it was hidden behind a shop that sold the hard-worked local mill wool. Those walking up the steps from Mortimer Gardens can still see two of what remains of the stilts which used to hold the clock. The chancel, Lady Chapel and vestries, dedicated to the memory of those who died in World War I, were added in 1939. A church tower was never added. In 1980 a large extension to the vestries was accomplished, turning them into a parish room. The church has no churchyard. Three of the stained-glass windows in the south aisle, depicting St Luke, St Paul and St Barnabas, are by Charles Eamer Kempe. Three others depict St Richard of Chichester, St George and St Martin of Tours. The other window is by Herbert Bryans and shows Anna the Prophetess (Luke 2:36\u201338) The East window was designed by Peter Strong and was installed in 1977. On the west wall is a mural painted by Sir Oliver Heywood in 1985, showing community life in the town. ==Christ Church and Tabernacle Church== Egypt Mill Hotel The Baptist chapel at Shortwood was rebuilt in 1837. In spite of the emigration of over 80 members to Adelaide between 1838 and 1840, the adult congregation was at least 1,000 in 1851. In 1864 a dispute over a new minister led to the secession of some members, who built their own chapel, opened in 1868, on Bristol Road; this was known as the Nailsworth Tabernacle Church. In 1910 the community rejoined the original Baptist church. In 1967 the Shortwood congregation united with the Forest Green Congregationalists to form a new church called Christ Church, Nailsworth. Services alternated for a few years with the Lower Forest Green Chapel, but the chapel on Newmarket Road, after modernisation, became the permanent place of worship in 1972. In that year Christ Church became a member of the new United Reformed Church, although retaining its links with the Baptist Union. It had a membership of 147 in 1973.British History Online, accessed July 16 2008 ==Governance== An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward mainly covers Nailsworth but also stretches south to Horsley. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,614. ===Twinned=== Nailsworth is twinned with L\u00e8ves, France. ==Sport and recreation== Forest Green Rovers is the premier football club in Nailsworth and plays in the EFL League Two at The New Lawn stadium in Forest Green, after winning the 2017 National League Play-off Final. In doing so, it made Nailsworth the smallest settlement ever to host an English Football League team. The town also has a non-league football club, Shortwood United F.C. at the Meadowbank Ground in Shortwood. It plays in the , part of the tenth tier of the English football league system. ==Notable people== Plaque on the cottage \"Glendower\" in Watledge commemorating W. H.
