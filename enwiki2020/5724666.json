    "text": "A water rite is a rite or ceremonial custom that uses water as the central feature. Typically, a person is immersed or bathed as a symbol of religious indoctrination or ritual purification. Examples include the Mikvah in Judaism, a custom of purity, and baptism, a custom that represents purity and indoctrination, in Christianity. Rites that use water, but not as their central feature, for example, that include drinking water, are not considered water rites. Category:Rituals ",
