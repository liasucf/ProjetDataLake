The organization was one of ten Community Film Workshops started by a partnership between the federal Office of Economic Opportunity and the American Film Institute. In 1974 the worker-operated organization evolved into a nonprofit company called Appalshop and established itself as a hub of filmmaking in Appalachia, and since that time has produced more than one hundred films, covering such subjects as coal mining, the environment, traditional culture, and the economy. The name was officially changed to reflect changing business structure and goals. Appalshop also produces theater, music, and spoken-word recordings (released on its June Appal Recordings label), as well as photography, multimedia, and books. Appalshop Main Building - Whitesburg, Kentucky Since 1985, Appalshop has also operated WMMT-FM (Mountain Community Radio), a radio station located in Whitesburg, Kentucky which serves much of central Appalachia (including portions of eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, and western West Virginia) with music and programming relevant to the region and its culture. WMMT also broadcasts live on the web. == Mission == As stated on its website, Appalshop's goals are: :*To document, disseminate, and revitalize the lasting traditions and contemporary creativity of Appalachia; :*To tell stories the commercial cultural industries don't tell, challenging stereotypes with Appalachian voices and visions; :*To support communities' efforts to achieve justice and equity and solve their own problems in their own ways; :*To celebrate cultural diversity as a positive social value; and :*To participate in regional, national, and global dialogue toward these ends. == Related grants and funding == === Appalshop funding === Appalshop relies on multiple funding sources, including endowments, individual donors, and public and private grants.
