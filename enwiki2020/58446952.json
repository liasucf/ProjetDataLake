    "text": "Deborah's Place, established in 1985, is a Chicago-based nonprofit organization that offers shelter, resources and support to the homeless women of Chicago. Its mission is to provide resources to homeless women in order for them to transition from being homeless. Programs and services include permanent supportive housing and basic necessities. Deborah's Place has worked with over 4,000 women, delivering employment training, access to education, healthcare, case management, permanent, interim and subsidized community-based housing. One-third of participants are recovering from drug abuse and mental illness. == Establishment == The founders named the organization \"Deborah's Place\" after an Old Testament story about a judge named Deborah, who raised an army of 10,000 soldiers to free oppressed people. They received assistance from the Immaculate Conception Church in Chicago in order to host their first overnight emergency women's shelter in the church's gymnasium. Funding began through the religious groups, community groups and private contributions. They networked with LaSalle Street Church, The First United Methodist Church, Holy Name Cathedral, St. James Cathedral and Fourth Presbyterian. Possible establishment locations have been rejected such as the one proposed by Reverend Pastor Joe Morin of St. Alphonsus in 2007, for a Deborah's Place shelter location to be placed on his church property, but lost in the South Lakeview Neighbors Association meeting due to \"disgruntled residents\". Deborah's Place has also faced disgruntled residents in possible establishment in Wicker Park. Audrey Thomas is the organization's current CEO. Thomas moved to Chicago in 1982 and began volunteering for Deborah's place in 1986. She held previously held positions of COO before becoming the CEO of Deborah's Place in 2004. Patricia \"Patty\" Crowley was a founder of Deborah's Place and helped with establishment in 1985. == History == With help from the Community Emergency Shelter Organization (CESO), Deborah's Place was able to create an its first overnight shelter for women on the North side of Chicago.
