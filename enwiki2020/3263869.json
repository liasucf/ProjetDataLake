He was one of the main figures in Galician Rexurdimento movement. He is also remembered as Rosal\u00eda de Castro's husband, publisher and main supporter. ==Life== Manuel Murgu\u00eda was born on 17 May 1833 in Arteixo (A Coru\u00f1a), in Galicia (Spain). His father was a chemist. Being at A Coru\u00f1a, a child Manuel Murgu\u00eda witnessed the liberal insurrection of locals against the central power on 23 April 1846. This happening ended with the execution of the M\u00e1rtires de Carral (The Martyrs of Carral). It all caused an important ideological impact on Murgu\u00eda, who wrote about that later on in his article La Voz de Galicia (The Voice of Galicia). Manuel Murgu\u00eda studied philosophy, and pharmacy (as was his father's wish), at Santiago de Compostela. However, Murgu\u00eda had a great interest on literature and history, so he finally gave up his studies to work as a writer and researcher. He used to go to Liceo de la Juventud, the cultural center on Santiago, meeting other students and intellectual people, including Eduardo Pondal, Aurelio Aguirre and Rosal\u00eda de Castro. On 1 June 1854 Murgu\u00eda published his first work in Galician language, Nena das Soidades (Girl of Loneliness). He then began working as a freelance writer in journals and magazines, getting a measure of success. With it, up-and-coming Murgu\u00eda would publish other works like Mi madre Antonia (My mother, Antonia), Los Lirios Blancos (The White Irises) and El \u00c1ngel de la Muerte (Angel of Death). He would then become one of the literary promises of his time. Murgu\u00eda went to Madrid, where he became friends with authors like Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer; he also began a romantic relationship with Rosal\u00eda de Castro, whom he married in Madrid on 10 October 1858. From the very beginning, Murgu\u00eda encouraged de Castro's literary interests and the publishing of her works. Particularly, de Castro's work Cantares Gallegos will be considered the beginning of the Rexurdimento (Galician literature renaissance). After getting a great success, Murgu\u00eda left his creative job and began a full-time work on historical research and its popularization. He also tried to extend his own political ideas. This is considered a milestone on the Rexurdimento. Once his first daughter was born, Murgu\u00eda published La Primera Luz (The First Light), a book of school texts about history and geography. The Spanish Ministry of Promotion encouraged to use of this book to teach in Galicia schools. Murgu\u00eda published important works, including Diccionario de escritores gallegos (Dictionary of Galician writers) in 1862. He then moved to Lugo in 1865, and then he published Historia de Galicia (History of Galicia). Manuel Murgu\u00eda. He was named Chief of the Arquivo Xeral de Galicia (General Archives of Galicia) in 1870, and fifteen years later he became Cronista Xeral do Reino (Feature Writer of the Kingdom), all the while writing and publishing different works. In 1890, Murgu\u00eda became the co-editor of La Patria Gallega (Galicia Native Country), a journal which included the first keys of the Galician nationalism. When he was 72 years old, Murgu\u00eda decided to create an Academy of the Galician Language. He shared his idea with other writers who met on Coru\u00f1an book store A Cova C\u00e9ltica. This Galician Academy became a reality on August 25, 1906. Murgu\u00eda also wanted to create a dictionary of Galician language, as he felt Galician vocabulary was scarce; he even suggested that his work in Galician could not be greater because of the absence of this dictionary. Murgu\u00eda died on 2 February 1923 on A Coru\u00f1a. One hundred years after he published the book Cantares Gallegos, in 1963, the date was commemorated with the D\u00eda das Letras Galegas (Galician Literature Day). Since then, May 17 would be dedicated to a different writer in Galician language every year. It was dedicated to Rosal\u00eda de Castro on its first installment in 1963. Afterwards, Murgu\u00eda's work was recognized when the D\u00eda das Letras Galegas was dedicated to him in 2000. ==Works== (Not including articles on the gazette of the Real Academia Gallega). ===Books=== * La primera luz, Vigo, Juan Compa\u00f1el, 1860. * Diccionario de escritores gallegos, Vigo, Juan Compa\u00f1el, 1862. * De las guerras de Galicia en el siglo XV y de su verdadero car\u00e1cter, A Coru\u00f1a, 1861. * Historia de Galicia, T.
