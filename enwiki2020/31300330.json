    "text": "David Hutcheson (14 June 1905 \u2013 18 February 1976) was a British character actor. He made his film debut in Fast and Loose in 1930 and played his only lead role in 1934's Romance in Rhythm. He went on to specialise in hooray henrys, silly asses and military types most prominently in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) and Peter Ustinov's School for Secrets (1946) and Vice Versa (1948). He continued in film and television until the 1970s. During the 1960s he often played the role of Colonel Pickering in stage productions of My Fair Lady. On 25 March 1949 he married Mary, Countess of Warwick, (n\u00e9e Mary Kathleen Hopkinson), the former wife of Charles Greville, 7th Earl of Warwick. This was shortly after the Earl of Warwick divorced his wife because of her adultery with Hutcheson. ==Selected filmography== * Fast and Loose (1930) - Lord Rockingham * Romance in Rhythm (1934) - Bob Mervyn * The Love Test (1935) - Thompson * Wedding Group (1936) - George Harkness * This'll Make You Whistle (1936) - Archie Codrington * The Sky's the Limit (1938) - Teddy Carson * A Gentleman's Gentleman (1939) - Bassy * Lucky to Me (1939) - Peter Malden * She Couldn't Say No (1940) - Peter Thurston * The Middle Watch (1940) - Cmdr.
