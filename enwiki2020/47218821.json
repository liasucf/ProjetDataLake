    "text": "The Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management (FMLM) is an intercollegiate professional body which promotes excellence in leadership on behalf of all doctors in the United Kingdom. The faculty was formed in 2011 and has 2,000 members, who are Members (MFMLM) or accredited as Fellows in increasing seniority: Associate Fellow (AFFMLM), Fellow (FFMLM) or Senior Fellow (SFFMLM). ==History== The faculty was established in October 2011 by all the medical royal colleges and faculties with endorsement from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). As a professional body for the setting and maintaining of standards, the faculty was seen as having an important role in helping medical leaders to be seen as skilled professionals rather than gifted amateurs. The faculty put forward the view that Medical leadership would have to become a true professional discipline to be able to deal with the challenges which the health service faces. The faculty have also commented on creating the right culture within organisations that provide healthcare and training. ==Governance== The chief executive and medical director is Peter Lees. It is governed by a Board of Trustees and Council of members. While the organisation was becoming established, the faculty's governing body was the Founding Council, with representatives drawn from all of the member Colleges and Faculties. This arrangement was in place from May 2011 until March 2013, at which point the new Council took over. In January 2014, a Board of Trustees was established. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Health in the London Borough of Camden Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom Category:2011 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Camden Category:Organizations established in 2011 ",
