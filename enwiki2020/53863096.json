    "text": "Marcus Arruntius Aquila was a Roman senator who flourished during the Principate. He held the office of suffect consul in 66 with Marcus Vettius Bolanus as his colleague.Paul Gallivan, \"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), pp. 292, 296, 310 His name in the Acta Arvalia () is missing the cognomen, which Giuseppe Camodeca reconstructed from an unpublished wax tablet from Herculeium.Camodeca, \"Novit\u00e0 sui fasti consolari delle tavolette cerate della Campania\", Publications de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome, 143 (1991), pp. 55f Aquila came of a Patavine family, a descendant of Arruntius Aquila, the governor of Galatia in 6 BC, who had a son named Marcus.Syme, \"Eight Consuls from Patavium\", Papers of the British School at Rome, 51 (1983), p. 116 He is known to be the father of Marcus Arruntius Aquila, consul in 77. That his son became consul 11 years later led Ronald Syme to suspect the elder Aquila \"was more than mature in age\" when he assumed the fasces.Syme, \"Eight Consuls\", p. 113 Aquila is possibly related to Lucius Arruntius Stella, consul in 100. His career is not well known. Only one of the offices he held is known: a milepost recovered from Lycia attests that he served as a procurator for the emperor Claudius in AD 50. == References == Category:People from Padua Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:1st-century Romans Aquila, Marcus Arruntius 66 ",
