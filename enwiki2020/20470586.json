    "text": "The Nysa Bridge is a late imperial Roman bridge over the Cakircak stream in Nysa (modern Sultanhisar) in the ancient region of Caria, modern-day Turkey. The long substructure was the second largest of its kind in antiquity, after the Pergamon Bridge. == Dating == The Greek geographer Strabo (63 BC\u2013AD 21), who lived in Nysa, mentioned a secret water conduit in the town, but it remains unclear whether he meant the existing tunnel-like bridge. An inscription at the northern wall of the tube, close to a bend after , indicates a construction date in late imperial times. It reads \"Work of Pra\u00fclos until this point\".Archaiologikon Deltion 1921\u201322, 84: \u03a0\u0323\u03c1\u03b1\u03b0\u0323\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd | \u1f15\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f67\u03b4\u03b5 == Construction == The Nysa Bridge served as a substructure for the area in front of the city theatre which lay close to the Cakircak stream. It was built as a two-level structure: the bottom vault spanned the brook. On top of it a row of arches connected the two hills that formed the urban area. The ground arch spanned the stream on a length of some , giving the bridge the appearance of a tube or a tunnel, although it was constructed entirely above ground. It consists of a single, wide vault whose uphill mouth widens to . The overall height of its semi-circular arch is , featuring a rise of . The vault is made of rubble stone laid in mortar, resting on a substructure of ashlar stone blocks of varying size (0.3\u20130.9 x 1.0\u20131.4 m). Originally featuring a continuous vaulting, it is collapsed today between m 75 and 85, and again at the downhill exit. The remaining, isolated structure at the downstream side has often been incorrectly referred to as a bridge of its own.All data: The Nysa Bridge was the second largest bridge substruction of its kind in antiquity, only surpassed by the nearby Bridge at Pergamon. By comparison, the width of a normal, free standing Roman bridge did not exceed . In its further course, the Cakircak also ran through the city stadion, so that naumachia could be given. There are remains of two other ancient bridges both up- and downstream. == Discharge capacity == The capacity limit of the Nysa Bridge in case of floods has been the subject of hydraulic and hydrological research. The gradient of the tunnel was calculated as 3.3% with a maximum discharge capacity of 290 m\u00b3/s. Exceeding this limit puts the bridge under internal pressure and damages the structure in the process. Considering that the Cakircak is long, with a median gradient of 19% and a drainage basin of , the following median intervals were calculated, depending on the method employed: *7,500 years (G\u00fcnerman method) *10,500 years (D.S.I. method) *13,000 years (Mockus method) *68,000 years (Snyder method) The study came to the conclusion that statistically every 13,500 years, a value which has been referred to as the \"arithmetic mean\", floods are to be expected which would exceed the capacity of the bridge. == See also == * List of Roman bridges * Roman architecture * Roman engineering == References == == Sources == * * == Further reading == * * == External links == Category:Roman bridges in Turkey Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Roman Caria Category:Tunnels in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in Ayd\u0131n Province Category:Arch bridges in Turkey ",
