    "text": "Mystikal is an album by trumpeter/composer Wallace Roney which was recorded in 2005 and released on the HighNote label.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed April 28, 2020 ==Reception== Allmusic's Matt Collar said \"Mystikal is a modern album made up of vintage parts. Which is to say that while Roney has deep affection for the sounds of '60s jazz and '70s funk and fusion, he is a resolutely forward-thinking musician who borrows from a variety of sources and time periods even when the overall sound is funky\". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted \"Mystikal continues Roney's progression. With the same core group as on Prototype ... it's not just about the evolution of the leader's approach, this time it's also about the evolution of a collective sound. ... As Roney's concept becomes more eclectic, it paradoxically becomes more focused. Mystikal continues his path towards combining past and present\u2014with, most importantly, a clear eye on the future\".Kelman, J. All About Jazz Review accessed April 28, 2020 Another review stated \"Roney's playing on Mystikal is some of his most lucid on record. The greater achievement, however, is the way he develops a template for how modern jazz can be re-immersed in funk rhythms without sounding dated, and how he then successfully merging turntablism into that same context. ... While all of the last three Roney records have presented different angles, we can't be that conclusive about the quality and insight of his vision until an entire record presents the concept. Eclecticism is cool, but it can make you look tentative, too. Still, this is a good record and pretty fresh music overall\".AAJ Staff All About Jazz Review II, accessed April 28, 2020 In JazzTimes, Mike Shanley wrote: \"The album alternates between acoustic tracks like the title piece or Kenny Dorham\u2019s \u201cPoetic\u201d and electric songs. One of Roney's more compelling qualities comes in the way he utilizes elements of the latter setting\u2013basic funk riffs, clavinet, electric piano\u2013to keep the fire burning rather than smoothing down the melodic potential. ... The only distraction from the program comes from Jeanty's samples and spoken- word interludes, which seem to pop up every time the horns take a break\".Shanley, M.
