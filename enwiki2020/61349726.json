K-108 was first established as a state highway in 1946, as a spur from a new alignment of US-59 to the Erie city line. In 1960, K-108 was extended east, then north, then west to US-59. This created a complete loop through Erie off US-59. Then K-108 was removed from the state highway system in a 2004 resolution. ==Route description== K-108 began at US-59 and began travelling east along West 4th Street. After about , it reached South Main Street, where it turned north. It continued north through the city, before reaching First Street, where it changed to North Main Street. It then continued north to State Street, then turned west. It continued along State Street for then terminated back at US-59. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2004, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 1490 vehicles near the southern terminus to 2320 vehicles near the northern terminus. K-108 was not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. ==History== Before 1946, US-59 ran directly north-south through Erie. Then on August 28, 1946, K-108 was established as a state highway from a new alignment of US-59 to Erie. In a November 10, 1960 resolution, K-108 was extended east, then north, then west to US-59 and K-57. This created a complete loop through Erie off US-59. The Kansas Department of Transportation removed K-108 from the state highway system in a July 19, 2004 resolution. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 108 Category:Transportation in Neosho County, Kansas ",
