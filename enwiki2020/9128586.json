In 1918, he was elected as a Labour member of the Bolton-upon- Dearne Urban District Council.

Williams first held ministerial office in Winston Churchill's wartime Coalition Government, when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1940 to 1945, serving under the Conservative minister Robert Hudson. He was made a Privy Counsellor in August 1941. In Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government, he was Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1945 to 1951, and after Labour lost the 1951 general election he was the opposition spokesperson on Agriculture until 1959.
