The Eaton brothers left the College of Montana in 1908, devoting more funding to the reorganization of the high school they had established with the help of Losekamp and Yegen. The school was reopened as Billings Polytechnic Institute in July 1908. ==Political career and death== Ernest Eaton first served in the Montana House of Representatives between 1915 and 1919.
