    "text": "Mariah Meali'i Namahoe Lucas (Richardson) Kalama (Jan 3, 1909 \u2014 Aug 22, 2004) was a Native Hawaiian quilter who was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship. She is known for popularizing Hawaiian quilting, and is well known in the Hawaiian quilting community. Mrs. Kalama was also an ordained lay pastor under Kahu Dr. Abraham Akaka of Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church - Westminster Abbey of the Pacific. == Early Life == Meali\u2019i Kalama was born on January 3, 1909 in Honolulu, Hawaii. During her youth, she often watched her grandmother and mother work on their latest quilting project. It was during her childhood that her interest in quilting began to grow. In her teenage years, she expressed her interest in quilting and, following, she spent a year and a half completing her first quilt with a design based on the ulu or breadfruit tree. Kalama pursued her education through attending the University of Hawaii for two years. == Career == === Education === In 1943, Kalama began teaching in the public schools. At this time, she also taught quilting for the Department of Parks and Recreation. In 1950, Kalama left her job to become the first director of a newly opened playground and recreation center. It was said that \"she could teach kids how to sew, quilt, [or] anything\". Until her retirement in 1975, she was the Park Director and also taught at \"Papak\u014dlea Playground\" (known today as Papak\u014dlea Community Center) and at other parks, and was a lay minister under Kahu Abraham Akaka at Kawaiahao Church. === Quilting === Kalama was a quilter throughout her lifetime. She created many of her own designs, which were influenced by the style of traditional Hawaiian quilts. Kalama's quilts were also inspired by nature and said herself that \"all designs must show that flowing gracefulness of nature\". Kalama was also known for using a creative color palette in her designs. At one point in her life, Laurance S. Rockefeller, founder of the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, commissioned Kalama to create 30 Hawaiian quilts. These quilts took Kalama and other women over 30,000 hours to stitch and were hung in the hotel's corridors. Kalama also made a quilt for Queen Liliuokalani's bed, whose home eventually became the governor's mansion. === Legacy and Awards === Meali'i Kalama is recognized for popularizing Hawaiian quilting, after what was considered to be a long period of disinterest. Many of her quilts have been collected and exhibited by the Museum of International Folk Art and she also has a quilt being held in the Smithsonian Institution. In 1980, the YMCA recognized Kalama \"for being responsible for the revival of Hawaiian quilting\". In 1985, Kalama became the first Hawaiian to receive a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. == References == Category:Quilters Category:University of Hawaii alumni Category:1909 births Category:National Heritage Fellowship winners Category:2004 deaths ",
