A sexy, sultry millennial slow jam similar to \"Ready for Whatever\" (2017), \"You Got Me,\" is a blend of steady drums and sensual synths reminiscent of 90's R&B; featuring Harrison's signature breathy coos.

Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, M\u00fda released a music video for the fan favorite \"Coolin'\".
