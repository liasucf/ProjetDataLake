In the Americas Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams compete against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group II advanced to the Americas Zone Group I. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group II, whereas teams who lost their play-offs were relegated to the Americas Zone Group III in 2000. ==Participating nations== * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Mexico vs. Paraguay=== ===Cuba vs. Haiti=== ===Dominican Republic vs. Peru=== ===Costa Rica vs. Uruguay=== ==Second round== ===Cuba vs. Mexico=== ===Peru vs. Uruguay=== ==Relegation play-offs== ===Haiti vs. Paraguay=== ===Costa Rica vs. Dominican Republic=== ==Third round== ===Peru vs. Mexico=== ==References== ==External links== *Davis Cup official website Category:Davis Cup Americas Zone Americas Zone Group II ",
