    "text": "In the Gleneagles Agreement, in 1977, Commonwealth Presidents and Prime Ministers agreed, as part of their support for the international campaign against apartheid, to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations, teams or individuals from South Africa. The agreement was unanimously approved by the Commonwealth of Nations at a meeting at Gleneagles, Perthshire, Scotland. The Gleneagles Agreement reinforced their commitment, embodied in the Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles (1971), to oppose racism. This commitment was further strengthened by the Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice, adopted by Commonwealth leaders in Lusaka in 1979. The Commonwealth was a relevant body to impose a sporting ban on South Africa because several of the sports most popular among white South Africans are dominated by Commonwealth member states, for example cricket and rugby union. ==The Gleneagles Agreement on sporting contacts with South Africa == == See also == * Sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era * Rugby union and apartheid * 1981 Springbok Tour * South African rebel tours * Halt All Racist Tours * South Africa national rugby union team * South Africa cricket team ==References== Category:International opposition to apartheid in South Africa Category:History of the Commonwealth of Nations Category:History of Perth and Kinross Category:Commonwealth sports competitions Category:Events associated with apartheid Category:Politics and sports Category:1977 in politics Category:1977 in sports Category:1977 in Scotland Category:1977 in international relations Category:South Africa\u2013United Kingdom relations Category:Rugby union and apartheid ",
