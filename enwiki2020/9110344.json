Due to the extended reshuffling of the structure for the 2008 campaign, survival in Divisions 1A and 1B, was much more precarious--with four relegation places in these divisions, the bottom two teams were relegated to Division 3, and the teams finishing in 5th place and 6th places were relegated to Division 2. Donegal won the 2007 National Football League by securing the Division One title, a historic achievement and their first National Football League title. They were unbeaten throughout the competition. Meath won the Division Two title. The Dublin vs. Tyrone match was the first Gaelic football match held in Croke Park under floodlights. ==Format== ===Division One=== The top two teams from both division one A and B go on to qualify for the league semi finals and then the winning team goes on to qualify for the final. The winner of the final game are the football league champions. The bottom two teams in Division one A and B are relegated to Division three of the next format for 2008. The teams who finish in fifth and sixth place in Division A and B are relegated to Division two in the new 2008 format. The teams in first, second, third and fourth position in both Division A and B qualify to play in the new 2008 format in Division One. ===Division two=== The top two teams from Division two A and B go on to qualify for the division two semi finals. The winners of the semi final go on to play in the Division two finals and the winner becomes the 2007 Division two champions. The top two teams in Division 2A and 2B go on to play in Division 2 in the 2008 format. The teams that finish in third and fourth position go on to play in Division 3 of the 2008 format and the bottom four teams will play in Division four of the 2008 format. ===Scoring Difference=== All of the final positions in the league will be determined by each team's scoring, there will be no playoffs in the 2007 National Football League. If two teams finish the league on the same points, the scores are then taken into consideration and the team with the best average go to the higher position. If the teams remain equal after the scores have been averaged out, the result of the game which involved the two teams will be seen as the deciding factor between the teams. ==Division One== ===Division 1A Table=== {| style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !F !A !Diff !Pts !Notes |- align=center style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Donegal ||7 ||6 ||1 ||0 ||10-79 ||8-64 ||+21 ||13||rowspan=2|Advance to NFL semi-final |- align=center style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mayo ||7 ||6 ||0 ||1 ||8-72 ||5-66 ||+15 ||12 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kerry ||7 ||4 ||1 ||2 ||3-78||6-62 ||+7 ||9||rowspan=2|Remain in Division 1 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Tyrone ||7 ||3 ||1 ||3 ||3-68 ||6-69 || \u201310 ||7 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Dublin ||7 ||3 ||0 ||4 ||6-73 ||2-66||+19 ||6||rowspan=2|Relegated to Division 2 of the 2008 NFL |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cork ||7 ||3 ||0 ||4 ||7-61||4-70 ||+10 ||6 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFCCCC;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Limerick ||7 ||1 ||1 ||5||6-67||8-73 ||\u201312 ||3||rowspan=2|Relegated to Division 3 of the 2008 NFL |- align=center style=\"background:#FFCCCC;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Fermanagh ||7 ||0 ||0 ||7 ||4-53 ||8-81 || \u201340 ||0 |} ===Division 1B Table=== {| style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !F !A !Diff !Pts !Notes |- align=center style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Galway ||7 ||5 ||0 ||2 ||6-68 ||2-66 ||+14||10||rowspan=2|Advance to NFL semi-final |- align=center style=\"background:#E8FFD8;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kildare ||7 ||4 ||2 ||1 ||2-77 ||4-66 ||+5||10 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Derry ||7 ||4 ||1 ||2 ||6-82||6-66 ||+16 ||9||rowspan=2|Remain in Division 1 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Laois ||7 ||3 ||3 ||1 ||6-79 ||4-71 || +14||9 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Westmeath ||7 ||3 ||0 ||4 ||4-67 ||6-69||\u20138 ||6||rowspan=2|Relegated to Division 2 of the 2008 NFL |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Armagh ||7 ||3 ||0 ||4 ||5-62||2-81 ||\u201310 ||6 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFCCCC;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Louth ||7 ||2 ||1 ||4||8-77||7-86 ||\u20137||5||rowspan=2|Relegated to Division 3 of the 2008 NFL |- align=center style=\"background:#FFCCCC;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Down ||7 ||0 ||1 ||6 ||2-73 ||8-79 || \u201324||1 |} ===Semi-Finals=== \\---- ===Final=== ==Division two== ==Division 2A== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !width=165|Team !width=20|Pld !width=20|W !width=20|D !width=20|L !width=20|Pts diff !width=20|Pts |- align=center style=\"background:yellow;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Monaghan ||7 ||7 ||0 ||0 ||+40 ||14 |- align=center style=\"background:yellow;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Roscommon ||7 ||5 ||0 ||2 ||+17 ||10 |- align=center style=\"background:white;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Longford ||7 ||3 ||1 ||3 ||+31 ||8 |- align=center style=\"background:white;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Leitrim ||7 ||4 ||0 ||3 ||+8 ||8 |- align=center style=\"background:red;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Offaly ||7 ||3 ||1 ||3 ||+18 ||6 |- align=center style=\"background:red;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Clare ||7 ||3 ||0 ||4 ||-5 ||6 |- align=center style=\"background:red;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Carlow ||7 ||1 ||0 ||6 ||-51 ||2 |- align=center style=\"background:red;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|London ||7 ||0 ||0 ||7 ||-58 ||0 |} Yellow - Qualified for Division Two semi-finals White - relegated to Division Three Red - relegated to Division Four ===Round One=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round Two=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round Three=== \\---- \\---- The result was declared null by the GAA;
