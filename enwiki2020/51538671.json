    "text": "The CNP-600 is a pressurized water nuclear reactor developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). The reactor has a gross electrical capacity of 650 MW and incorporates two primary cooling loops. It is a generation II reactor based on China's first commercial nuclear reactor design, the CNP-300, and on the M310 reactor design used in Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The first CNP-600 unit began operation at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in 2002, with other 3 units coming online between 2004 and 2011. There have been built two further CNP-600 reactors at Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant, which went into regular operation in 2015 and 2016. A larger version of the design, the CNP-1000 with three loops, has been developed by the CNNC. The new design will have improved safety systems and an extended design life of 60 years. ==See also== * Nuclear power in China ==References== Category:Pressurized water reactors Category:Nuclear technology in China ",
