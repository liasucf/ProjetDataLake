    "text": "The Coiba Island howler (Alouatta coibensis) is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Panama. Although the Coiba Island howler is generally recognized as a separate species, mitochondrial DNA testing is inconclusive as to whether it is actually a subspecies of the mantled howler. The reason for treating it as a separate species is the dermal ridges of its hands and feet differ from those of the mantled howler. A. c. coibensis is smaller than other Central American howler monkeys and has duller pelage than the Azuero howler, Alouatta coibensis trabeata. ==Subspecies== The two subspecies of this howler are: *Alouatta coibensis coibensis Thomas, 1902, found on Coiba Island and Jicaron, off the Pacific coast of Panama *Azuero howler, A. c. trabeata Lawrence, 1933, endemic to the Azuero Peninsula in Panama. ==References== ==External links== Category:Howler monkeys Howler, Coiba Island Category:Mammals described in 1902 ",
