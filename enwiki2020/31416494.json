    "text": "The \"Marines' Hymn\" is the official hymn of the United States Marine Corps, introduced by the first director of the USMC Band, Francesco Maria Scala. Its music originates from an 1867 work by Offenbach with the lyrics added by an anonymous author at an unknown time in the following years. Authorized by the Commandant of the Marine Corps in 1929, it is the oldest official song in the United States Armed Forces. The \"Marines' Hymn\" is typically sung at the position of attention as a gesture of respect. However, the third verse is also used as a toast during formal events, such as the birthday ball and other ceremonies. ==History== The \"Marines' Hymn\" performed in 1944 by the Boston Pops. Instrumental sample of a single verse of the Marines' hymn played by the President's Own Marine Band. Some lyrics were popular phrases before the song was written. The line \"To the shores of Tripoli\" refers to the First Barbary War, and specifically the Battle of Derne in 1805. After Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon and his Marines hoisted the American flag over the Old World for the first time, the phrase was added to the flag of the United States Marine Corps. \"The Halls of Montezuma\" refers to the Battle of Chapultepec on 12/13 September 1847 during the Mexican\u2013American War, where a force of Marines stormed Chapultepec Castle. Strictly, the usage \"Halls of Montezuma\" is factually wrong, as the building which the Marines stormed had been erected by the Spanish rulers of Mexico, more than two centuries after the Aztec Emperor Montezuma was overthrown. Rather than the \"Halls of Montezuma\", the halls which the Marines entered were actually those of the Viceroys of New Spain. The United States Marine Corps honors its role in the Battle of Chapultepec and the subsequent occupation of Mexico City through the first line of the \"Marines' Hymn,\" From the Halls of Montezuma. Marine Corps tradition maintains that the red stripe worn on the dress-blues trousers of officers and noncommissioned officers, and commonly known as the blood stripe commemorates the high number of Marine NCOs and officers killed storming the castle of Chapultepec in September 1847. As noted, While the lyrics are said to date from the 19th century, no pre-20th century text is known. The author of the lyrics is likewise unknown. Legend has it that a Marine on duty in Mexico penned the hymn. The unknown author transposed the phrases in the motto on the Colors so that the first two lines of the Hymn would read: \"From the Halls of Montezuma, to the Shores of Tripoli\", favoring euphony over chronology. The music is from the Gendarmes' Duet (the \"bold gendarmes\") from the revision in 1867 of the Jacques Offenbach opera Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, which debuted in Paris in 1859. Correspondence between Colonel Albert S. McLemore and Walter F. Smith (the second leader of the United States Marine Band) traces the tune: The name of the opera and a part of the chorus was secured from Major Wallach and forwarded to Mr. Smith, who replied: John Philip Sousa once wrote: The lyrics are also contained in the book Rhymes of the Rookies published in 1917. The author of these poems was W.E. Christian. The book is available online in several formats. It consists of a series of poems regarding military life prior to World War I. Some websites, including the official USMC website, claim that the U.S. Marine Corps secured a copyright on the song either 19 August 1891 or 18 August 1919. U.S. Copyright Law prohibits copyrighting \"any work of the United States Government\", including subordinate agencies such as the Marine Corps, but allows them to hold \"copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise\". The Library of Congress asserts that the song was originally copyrighted in 1919 by The Leatherneck, which was started by off-duty US Marines in 1917 using a donation from the YMCA, and therefore might not be considered a \"work of the United States Government\". (It does not state whether Leatherneck's copyright was ever transferred to the Marine Corps.) In addition, several composers do hold copyrights on different arrangements of the song. These copyrights cover only the specific arrangements and not the song as a whole.United States. Library of Congress. Copyright Office. Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series - Music. Part 5. No. 1. Sec. 1. Washington:, 1970. p. 830. Print. In 1929 the commandant of the Marine Corps authorized the three verses of the Marines' Hymn as the official version, but changed the fifth through eighth lines: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Pre-1929 version !Authorized change |- |Admiration of the nation, we're the finest ever seen; And we glory in the title Of United States Marines. |First to fight for right and freedom And to keep our honor clean; We are proud to claim the title Of United States Marine. |} This older version can be heard in the 1951 film Halls of Montezuma. On 21 November 1942, Commandant Thomas Holcomb approved a change in the words of the first verse's fourth line from \"On the land as on the sea\" to \"In the air, on land, and sea\" to reflect the addition of aviation to the Corps' arsenal. Western Illinois University uses the hymn prior to all football games. They are the only nonmilitary academy allowed to use the hymn. The university has had permission to use the official nickname, mascot, and hymn of the Corps since 1927. ==Lyrics== From the Halls of Montezuma To the shores of Tripoli; We fight our country's battles In the air, on land, and sea; First to fight for right and freedom And to keep our honor clean; We are proud to claim the title Of United States Marine. Our flag's unfurled to every breeze From dawn to setting sun; We have fought in ev'ry clime and place Where we could take a gun; In the snow of far-off Northern lands And in sunny tropic scenes; You will find us always on the job The United States Marines. Here's health to you and to our Corps Which we are proud to serve; In many a strife we've fought for life And never lost our nerve; If the Army and the Navy Ever look on Heaven's scenes; They will find the streets are guarded By United States Marines. ==See also== *\"The Song of the Marines\" *Halls of Montezuma (film) *To the Shores of Tripoli *The U.S. Air Force (song) *Anchors Aweigh *\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\" *Semper Paratus (march) *Sporting Clubs that use the tune for their respective club songs: **Australian Football ***Adelaide Football Club - \"The Pride of South Australia\" ***Perth Football Club ***Werribee Football Club **Rugby League ***Melbourne Storm - \"We are the Mighty Melbourne storm\" ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==Further reading== *Collins, Ace.
