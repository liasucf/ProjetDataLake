After 1923 R\u0103dulescu switched to refereeing, coaching and administration and was involved in the development of the Romanian football federation in 1930, a development which put an end to the practice of the game being run in his country by a commission. He was manager of the national team on 18 occasions and coach on a further 24 occasions between 1923 and 1940. In the second World Cup he acted as a selector and at the third World Cup he was employed as the trainer of the side. He was a referee for 20 years, directing 200 first-division matches as well as 102 international matches between clubs and 11 between countries. He assisted as a linesman on other occasions when Romania were playing in the 1930s.Untitled Document 1935Radulescu Costel ==National team coach== His position of coach of the Romania national football team when they played in the first three FIFA World Cups in Uruguay, Italy and France was assured when he assumed the post (for the second time) in 1929 taking charge of the team after Teofil Morariu's side lost heavily in Yugoslavia in May 1928, and lead the Romanians from the start of the 1929-31 Balkan Cup campaign, which Romania eventually won, losing only in Sofia but scoring healthily in all matches and defeating fellow World Cup entrants Yugoslavia in October 1929.Balkan Cup (for Nations) 1929/31 For the World Cup R\u0103dulescu was assisted by Octav Luchide.National team of Romania Prior to the tournament, following defeat to Yugoslavia in May, 1930, he dropped Emerich Vogl as his captain and replaced him with Rudolf Wetzer, the Juventus Bucure\u0219ti forward. ==Uruguay, 1930== Romania managed to participate in the first World Cup due to the enthusiasm and persuasiveness of the Secretary General of FRFA at that time, Octav Luchide. During the competition, Romanian coach Costel R\u0103dulescu twice officiated as a linesman in matches featuring Argentina and Uruguay on those match days when the Romanians were not playing.Source: http://es.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/01/17/75/48/s25factsyouneedtoknowaboutthefifaworldcup_10-00556_104_en_es.pdf (Ulises Saucedo, the Bolivian coach, also acted as a match referee during the Finals). He assisted as a linesman on other occasions when Romania were playing in the 1930s. The apocryphal influence of King Carol on the selection of the first team is disputed. FIFA accept that \"a decree from King Carol gave the players three months off from their jobs and a guarantee that they [would] be re-employed on their return. The king himself [was] also active as coach ...\" But there is nothing to substantiate such claims and the King, absent from the nation since 1925, only returned to Romania on 8 June 1930. ==References== *1936 bobsleigh two-man results *1936 bobsleigh four-man results Category:1896 births Category:1981 deaths Category:1934 FIFA World Cup managers Category:1930 FIFA World Cup managers Category:1938 FIFA World Cup managers Category:Romanian footballers Category:Romania national football team managers Category:Romanian football referees Category:Romanian military personnel of World War I Category:People from Vrancea County Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Romanian football managers ",
