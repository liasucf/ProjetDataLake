    "text": "Thomas Joseph Malone (17 May 1876 \u2013 5 June 1933) was a New Zealand cricketer who played first-class cricket for Canterbury from 1896 to 1909. Malone was a right-arm spin bowler, able to move the ball either way off the pitch, who often opened the bowling. He bowled unchanged throughout the innings when he took his best first-class figures, 7 for 30 against Otago in 1896\u201397. Canterbury dismissed Otago in the first innings for 68, but Otago recovered to win by 146 runs. He represented New Zealand once, in a four-day match against the touring Melbourne Cricket Club in 1905\u201306, a tour that, despite the strength of the Melbourne team, does not have first-class status. He took 7 for 54, New Zealand's only notable performance in match that the inclement weather helped them to draw.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894\u20131985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, p. 47. Malone worked for more than 30 years for P. & D. Duncan Ltd. engineering works in Christchurch. He died at the age of 57, leaving a widow and their three daughters and a son. ==References== ==External links== * * Thomas Malone at CricketArchive Category:1876 births Category:1933 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Christchurch ",
