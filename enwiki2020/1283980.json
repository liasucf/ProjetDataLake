    "text": "Marand (; ; also Romanized as Morand) is a city and capital of Marand County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. Marand is among major cities in the province. It is located in the north-west of capital of the province Tabriz. Marand has been known by various names in history, such as Maryana, Mandagarana, and Maranda. ==Etymology== Moritz von Kotzebue and August von Haxthausen both described local legends that placed the burial spot of Noah's wife at Marand. Both authors contended that the name of the city means \"the mother lies here,\" referring to Noah's wife. According to Kotzebue: ==History== The history of the town goes back to the pre-Islamic era. During the period of Armenian Kingdom Marand was called Bakurakert. Between 815 till 850, Marand was primarily controlled by Mohammad ibn Ba'ith who was Iranicized to a considerable extent.Minorsky, \u201cMarand\u201d in Encyclopaedia of Islam. P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs (eds.). Vol. 6, (1991): p. 504 \"According to one of al-Tabari's authorities (iii, 1388), the shaykhs of Maragha who praised the bravery and literary ability (adab) of Ibn Bai'th also quoted his Persian verses (bi'l-fdrisiyya). This important passage, already quoted by Barthold, BSOS, ii (1923), 836\u20138, is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in north-western Persia at the beginning of the 9th century. Ibn Bai\u2019th must have been Iranicised to a considerable extent, and, as has been mentioned, he relied for support on the non-Arab elements in his Rustakhs (\u2018Uludj Rasatikhi\u2019)\u201d The elders of Maragha who quoted his Persian poetry also praised his bravery and his literary ability. He was Iranicized to considerable extent and the statement of Tabari on him is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwest Persia at the beginning of the 9th century. ==Famous natives== For a complete list see: :Category:People from Marand * Ganjali Sabahi (1909-1990) - Writer * Aboutaleb Talebi (born 1945) - wrestler * Musa Kalantari (1949-1981) - politician * Jalil Farjad (born 1951) - Theatre and film actor * Gholamreza Shafeei (born 1951) - politician * Isa Kalantari (born 1952) - politician * Mohammad-Taghi Pourmohammadi (born 1956) - cleric * Shirin Bina (born 1964) - Theatre and film actor * Meysam Naghizadeh (born 1986) - football player * Mohsen Delir (born 1988) - football player ==See also== * Marand Khanate ==References== Category:Populated places in Marand County Category:Cities in East Azerbaijan Province ",
