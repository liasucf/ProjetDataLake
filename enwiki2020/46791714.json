    "text": "Thienorphine is a very potent, extremely long-acting, orally-active opioid analgesic with mixed agonist\u2013antagonist properties which was developed by the Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology as a potential treatment for opioid dependence. It is a high-affinity, balanced ligand of the \u03bc- (Ki = 0.22 nM), \u03b4- (Ki = 0.69 nM), and \u03ba-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.14 nM), behaving as a partial agonist of the \u03bc- (Emax = 19%\u201328%) and \u03ba-opioid receptors (Emax = 65\u201375%) and as an antagonist of the \u03b4-opioid receptor. It also possesses relatively low affinity for the nociceptin receptor (Ki = 36.5 nM), where it acts as an antagonist. ==See also== * Buprenorphine * Etorphine * Dihydroetorphine * Diprenorphine ==References== Category:Drug rehabilitation Category:Kappa agonists Category:Morphinans Category:Mu-opioid agonists Category:Nociceptin receptor antagonists Category:Opioid antagonists Category:Oripavines Category:Semisynthetic opioids ",
