    "text": "\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" is a song by Elton John, released in 1997 as the first single from his 25th studio album The Big Picture. Later, the single was also released as a double A-side single with \"Candle in the Wind 1997\". That single and its video were dedicated to the memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died that year, with proceeds from the sale of the single going towards Diana's charities. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, with certified sales, this double A-side is \"the best- selling single of all time\". (certified sales)Elton John: Biography | Rolling Stone Music Rolling Stone \"Candle in the Wind 1997,\" easily became the all- time highest-certified single\". The Guinness World Records 2009 states that the song is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\".Guinness Book of Records, 2007 Edition, page 187 ==Music video== The video for the song was directed by Tim Royes and features Elton singing and playing piano to an empty theater, as well as actors and actresses from the UK television programme This Life, as well as supermodels Kate Moss and Sophie Dahl appearing in a fashion show. Many consider it as one of Elton John's best videos. John has publicly revealed (through his \"warts and all\" documentary Tantrums and Tiaras) that he finds videos \"fucking loathsome\" and after the videos from his album The Big Picture refrained from appearing in his own videos unless they were cameo appearances. ==Sales and chart positions== In the UK alone, the double A-side single with \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" sold over 4,930,000 copies (8\u00d7 Platinum), making the song the best-selling single ever in UK history. It remained for five weeks at the number-one position. In the US, the double A-side single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The best-selling single in Billboard history and the only single ever certified Diamond in the US, the single sold over 11 million copies in the US. On the US adult contemporary chart, however, \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" charted separately; while the tribute to Princess Diana peaked at number 2 on this chart, \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" spent 10 weeks at number 1 in late 1997 and early 1998. This double-sided single holds the record for the fewest weeks in a chart year from a year-end number-one single, with as few as eight. (In 1998, it had 34 more total weeks, however it was number 8 in the year-end list of 1998.) ==Critical reception== Billboard said the song is \"a grandly executed ballad that washes John's larger-than-life performance in cinematic strings and whooping, choir- styled backing vocals. An instant fave for die-hards, this single will bring kids at top 40 to the table after a few spins.\" ==Personnel== *Elton John \u2013 piano, vocals *Davey Johnstone \u2013 guitars *John Jorgenson \u2013 guitars *Bob Birch \u2013 bass guitar *Guy Babylon \u2013 keyboards *Charlie Morgan \u2013 drums and percussion *Paul Carrack \u2013 organ *Carol Kenyon \u2013 backing vocals *Jackie Rawe \u2013 backing vocals *Strings arranged by Guy Babylon and Anne Dudley *Anne Dudley \u2013 conducting ==Charts== The following chart entries are for \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" as a solo single. ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997\u20131998) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |29 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi) | 8 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (LP3) | 19 |- !scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE) | 3 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) | 22 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) | 83 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1998) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) | 31 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s ballads Category:1997 singles Category:Elton John songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:SNEP Top Singles number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Sweden Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Dutch Top 40 number-one singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs with music by Elton John Category:Songs with lyrics by Bernie Taupin Category:Song recordings produced by Chris Thomas (record producer) Category:Music videos directed by Tim Royes Category:1997 songs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Scotland ",
