    "text": "NGC 1592 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Eridanus. It is about 20,000 light years across. It has not been studied in detail, as it is at 27 degrees south, making it not visible below 63 degrees north in a flat area, and about 50 degrees north in a hilly area. It was discovered in 1835 by John Herschel. ==2014 observations== Until 2014, not much was known about the galaxy, other than the fact it was irregular. In early 2014, the galaxy was observed with a 2-foot telescope at the SARA remote observatory in Chile, revealing the galaxy in higher resolution. It appears the galaxy is in the process of forming stars at a high rate - primarily in the red areas in the image. Additionally, the galaxy has several small clumps of stars, implying an ongoing merger. ==Companions== NGC 1592 appears to have a companion, 2MFGC (2MASS Flat Galaxy Catalog) 3572, at 40 million light years away, assuming similar velocity with NGC 1592. they are separated by about 750,000 \u00b1200,000 light years. 250px ==References== ==External links== * 18351114 Category:Irregular galaxies Category:Barred spiral galaxies 1592 015292 Category:Eridanus (constellation) ",
