    "text": "Things Unseen is a studio album by American jazz pianist Kenny Barron released in 1997 via Verve Records label. The album contains eight original and previous compositions written by Barron. ==Reception== In his review on JazzTimes, Willard Jenkins noted: \"Barron, who has achieved something akin to MVP status among piano players primarily for his broad capacity to enhance whoever\u2019s session or record date he lays hands on, should also be recognized for his ability to artfully craft recordings under his imprimatur. The elegant Things Unseen continues that craft. There is a certain airiness, a certain judicious use of space that pervades this date, as Barron and company certainly know how to avoid sonic traffic jams and engage a sense of openness that enhances this disc\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Band *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *David Williams \u2013 bass *Victor Lewis \u2013 drums *John Scofield \u2013 guitar *Mino Cinelu \u2013 percussion *John Stubblefield \u2013 saxophone *Eddie Henderson \u2013 trumpet *Naoko Terai \u2013 violin Production *Jean-Philippe Allard \u2013 executive producer *Josef Woodard \u2013 liner notes *Joe Marciano \u2013 mastering, mixing *Joanne Klein \u2013 producer == References == ==External links== * Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1997 albums Category:Verve Records live albums ",
