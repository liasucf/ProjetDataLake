    "text": "Sydney's Wonderland, also known as Western Sydney Theme Park, is a proposed amusement park planned by Mount Druitt developer and Urban Estate Developments managing director, Ammar Khan. It is to be based on the original Wonderland Sydney, which opened in 1985 and closed in 2004. The park will be multi-themed and would include a water park, a wildlife park and the return of the Wonderland. ==Development== Mr Khan has been working on the project since 2009, hoping to incorporate aspects of the old Wonderland. Khan is a property developer and worked in the former Wonderland Sydney for nine years. \u201cI worked there for nine years, up until it closed, and even tried to approach big business to keep the park alive. I vowed to bring the park back, not just as a desire but a life-consuming obsession,\u201d Mr Khan stated. The cost for the project would stand around $150 million for the amusement park itself, and an additional $80 million each for the wildlife and water parks. On its support, Khan stated, \"a couple of councils have indicated preliminary support but that\u2019s still early days...We really need to do is to finalise the land and get something started\". According to Khan, the park would be \"instrumental in providing numerous economic growth opportunities\" to the region. The park would take 3 to 5 years to complete and it will trade longer hours than usual. The park has the backing of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. ===Location=== The project has reached the town planning stage where the final location is decided upon and the process of mapping out the precinct can begin. The Park is searching for a piece of land about 300 acres. Suburbs around Londonderry, Marsden Park and Castlereagh in the northwest, or Badgerys Creek, Hoxton Park and Luddenham in the southwest are contenders. ==Attractions== Sydney's Wonderland will be divided into various themed zones and that they will be a reminiscent of themes previously at Wonderland Sydney. The park's layout will be a loop, which is the most common layout used in theme parks. A new wooden roller coaster, Bush Beast II, is planned, and the Zodiac double wheel will be back. The park will also include recreational tourism facilities and mixed commercial activities such as hotel operations, ice skating rink, bowling alley, various playgrounds for kids, golf course, nightlife venues, live music venue, cinemas and restaurants. The boulevard would be situated within the centre of the park, linking all three parks with pedestrian-friendly streets. Khan says the boulevard will be a \"very busy entertainment sort of area and it means people who are not to, or do not want to, pay for full-day tickets can come out there and have a good time\". The boulevard is set to include cafes. ==See also== *Raging Waters Sydney, a nearby water park. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Proposed amusement parks Category:Proposed infrastructure in Australia Category:Tourist attractions in Sydney Category:Amusement parks in New South Wales ",
