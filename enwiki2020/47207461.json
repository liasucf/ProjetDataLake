Bailey was also a producer of the film. In addition, Bailey was one of the producers of Torte Bluma, a 2005 dramatic short film starring Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Simon McBurney about the relationship between a concentration camp commandant and the Jewish slave who cooks his meals. The film, which won \"best of the festival\" at the Palm Springs International ShortFest in 2005 and was nominated for best narrative short at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006, was distributed by Phase 4 films as part of a compilation called Guilty Hearts. In 2011, Bailey was hired by Marvel Studios to write the script for a narrative feature film based on the African comic-book character Black Panther.

Kennedy. Their wedding was originally scheduled for July 17, 1999, but was postponed following the plane crash which killed Rory's cousin, John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law. Together they have three children: Georgia Elizabeth Kennedy-Bailey, born September 30, 2002; Bridget Katherine Kennedy-Bailey, born July 4, 2004; and Zachary Corkland Kennedy-Bailey, born July 16, 2007.
