It is located in the Benedictine monastery of San Vitale on via San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy. The collection, initially assembled through the efforts of local erudite Camaldolese monks, was established as a museum in 1885, and moved to this site by the early 20th century. It contains a large collection of Ancient Roman artifacts, including lapidary epitaphs and portions from sepulchral monuments. The artifacts date from early Roman through Byzantine in scope. It also displays Renaissance bronzes, and ivory collection, a large number of icons, ceramics, and ancient armor and weapons.
