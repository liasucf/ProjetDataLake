    "text": "The 1997 Chicago Cubs season was the 126th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, the 122nd in the National League and the 82nd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs finished fifth and last in the National League Central with a record of 68\u201394. The team never had a record above .500 at any point during the season. The Cubs lost the first 14 games of the season, before finally winning the second game of a double-header against the New York Mets. The 0-14 start brought the superstition of the \"billy goat curse\" to the forefront, and at one point a goat was actually led around Wrigley Field in an effort to end the curse. This was also Harry Caray's final season as broadcaster for the team, and in MLB. He died just prior to the 1998 Chicago Cubs season. ==Offseason== *December 10, 1996: Mel Rojas was signed as a Free Agent with the Chicago Cubs.Mel Rojas Statistics Baseball-Reference.com ==Regular season== *June 16 \u2013 The first interleague game between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox took place at the new Comiskey Park.
