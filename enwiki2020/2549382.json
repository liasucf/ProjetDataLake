He is the founder and artistic director of Garth Fagan Dance, a modern dance company based in Rochester, New York. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Fagan was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Oxford educated S.W. Fagan, former Chief Education Officer of Jamaica, and Louise I. Walker. It was a gymnastics class that initially drew his attention to dance early on. While attending Excelsior High school, he studied with Ivy Baxter at the Jamaica National Dance Company and performed at the inauguration of Cuban President Fidel Castro in 1959. Fagan was educated at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with sights on becoming a psychologist. ===Career=== Fagan worked at several dance companies in Detroit, and moved to Rochester New York in 1970, and there established his dance company originally named the \"Bottom of the Bucket BUT ... Dance Theatre\" in 1970. He was a Professor, at State University of New York, Brockport starting in 1970. Fagan choreographed for the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the Lim\u00f3n Dance Company in the 1970s. He has studied the works of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Pearl Primus, Alvin Ailey, Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, and Katherine Dunham. He is also influenced by Caribbean and West African dances. Fagan's choreography incorporates elements of modern dance, ballet, Afro-Caribbean dance, and social dance. Many of his works are autobiographical or include themes of personal relevance. His untitled 1977 work chronicles the dissolution of his marriage, showing a couple beginning a relationship with affection and passion but eventually drifting apart due to inevitable obstacles. Griot New York, which premiered in 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is about the experiences of the underprivileged living in New York City. The piece juxtaposes linear balletic movement with sharp angular gestures, twitching, and erotic partnering to represent the diversity and contrast found in big cities as well as conflict in his own life. In Moth Dreams, choreographed in 1992, Fagan celebrates his childhood, adolescence, and relationship with his mother. ===Personal life=== Fagan resides in Rochester, New York, is now divorced, and has two children. ==Stage productions== *From Before (1978) *Oatka Trail (1979) *Prelude (1981, revised 1983) *Touring Jubilee 1924 (Professional) (1982) *Sonata and the Afternoon (1983) *Never Top 40 (Jukebox) (1985) *Passion Distanced (1987) *Time After Before Place (1988) *Until By & If (1990) *Griot New York (1991) *Moth Dreams (1992) * Draft of Shadows (1993) * Postcards: Pressures and Possibilities (1994) * Earth Eagle First Circle (1995) * Mix 25 (1996) * Nkanyit (1997) * The Lion King (1997) *Two Pieces of One: Green (1998) *Woza (1999) *Trips and Trysts (2000) *Music of the Line/Words in the Shape (2001) *Translation Transition (2002) *DANCECOLLAGEFORROMIE (2003) *----ING (2004) *Life: Dark/Light (2005) *Senku (2006) *Edge/Joy (2007) *Prelude (1993) * Phone Tag Thanks and Things(2009) ==Honours and awards== Fagan is a Distinguished University Professor at the State University of New York at Brockport.
