According to World Bank estimates, more than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods with some 300 million living in them. The forest product industry is a source of economic growth and employment, with global forest products traded internationally is estimated at $327 billion. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that every year 130,000 km\u00b2 of the world's forests are lost due to deforestation. Conversion to agricultural land, unsustainable harvesting of timber, unsound land management practices, and creation of human settlements are the most common reasons for this loss of forested areas. According to the World Bank, deforestation accounts for up to 20 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. FAO data estimates that the world's forests and forest soil store more than one trillion tons of carbon \u2013 twice the amount found in the atmosphere. The World Bank estimates that forests provide habitats to about two-thirds of all species on earth, and that deforestation of closed tropical rainforests could account for biodiversity loss of as many as 100 species a day. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration, \"Across the globe lie more than a billion hectares of lost and degraded forest land that could be restored\". == Campaign == The Secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests is the focal point for implementation of the International Year in collaboration with Governments, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests and other relevant organizations and processes. Governments, regional and international organizations and civil society organizations are expected to create national committees and designate focal points in their respective countries to facilitate organization of activities in support of the International Year of Forests. == Celebrations == Woodsy Owl and Smokey Bear give each other a fist bump at the International Year of Forests celebration for U.S. Department of Agriculture employees, on Friday, 3 June 2011 in the patio of the Whitten Building, Washington, D.C.

The goal is to provide all forestry stakeholders with ideas and resources to participate in the celebration over the year.
