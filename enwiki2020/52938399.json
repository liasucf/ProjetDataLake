    "text": "Owners is a 1972 play by British playwright Caryl Churchill. It was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre's Theatre Upstairs. The Royal Court production was directed by Nicholas Wright. The play is a satire of property rights about real estate and of the people who own real estate and those who live in rented accommodation. In New Haven Register, E. Kyle Minor described Owners as an \"intermittently interesting and otherwise tedious\" work that was written before Churchill had become a genius of theater. Sylviane Gold of The New York Times stated that \"she had yet to achieve the formal mastery that would make later plays like \u201cCloud Nine\u201d and \u201cTop Girls\u201d instant modernist classics\", but argued that Churchill's \"acidic critique of capitalist freebooters and the culture that worships them as heroes carries even more resonance today than it did in 1972\". ==References== Category:1972 plays Category:Plays by Caryl Churchill ",
