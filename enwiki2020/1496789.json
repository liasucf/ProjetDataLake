    "text": "Won-Buddhism (\uc6d0\ubd88\uad50, W\u014fnbulgyo) is a form of modernized Buddhism. Won-Buddhism can be regarded either as a syncretic new religious movement combining Korean Seon with features from Donghak Neo-Confucianism, or as an offshoot of Seon Buddhism.Michael Pye, \"Won Buddhism as a Korean New Religion,\" Numen 49, no. 2 (2002): 113\u2013141. ==Translations of the name== The name \"Won Buddhism\" comes from the Korean words \uc6d0/\u5713 won (\"circle\") and \ubd88\uad50/\u4f5b\u654e bulgyo (\"Buddhism\"), literally meaning \"Round Buddhism\" or interpreted as \"Consummate Buddhism.\" By \"consummate,\" Won Buddhists mean that they incorporate several different schools of Buddhist thought into their doctrine; that is, where some schools focus only on practicing meditation (sam\u0101dhi), some schools devote themselves fully to studying scriptures (praj\u00f1\u0101), and still others practice only their school's precepts (\u015b\u012bla), Won Buddhism believes in incorporating all three into daily practice. ==History== Pak Chungbin (\ubc15\uc911\ube48 \u6734\u91cd\u5f6c, 1891\u20131943, aka Sot'aesan) attained bodhi in 1916. In 1924, he founded a new religious order with Buddhist teachings as its central doctrine, establishing the Society of the Study of the Buddhadharma at Iksan, North Jeolla Province. In 1947, Song Gyu (\uc1a1\uaddc, 1900\u20131962), the second patriarch, renamed the order \"W\u014fn Buddhism.\" ==Scriptures and writings== Pak's original doctrine was published as the Pulgyo ch\u014fngj\u014fn (The Correct Canon of Buddhism) in 1943. It was later redacted and expanded to its current form in 1977, and today is included in the main doctrinal book W\u014fnbulgyo ch\u014fns\u014f.W\u014fnbulgyo ch\u014fns\u014f, (Iri: W\u014fnbulgyo Ch'ulp'ansa, 2014). First published 1977. W\u014fnbulgyo ch\u014fns\u014f includes Ch\u014fngj\u014fn (The Principle Book of Won Buddhism), Taejonggy\u014fng (The Scripture of the Founding Master), and several other primary canonical sources. ==Connection to other Eastern philosophies== Won Buddhism can be considered an amalgamation of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism.Henrik Hjork Sorensen, Ole Bruun, and Arne Kalland, eds, Asian Perceptions of Nature (Nordic Institute of Asian Studies, 1992). ==References== ==Further reading== * Baker, Don. \"Korea's Won Buddhism: is it really a new religion?\", Paper presented at the CENSUR Center for Studies on New Religions International Conference.
