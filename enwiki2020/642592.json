    "text": "Kitchener Centre () is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997. ==Geography== The district includes the north-central and north-eastern parts of the city of Kitchener, Ontario, including the downtown core. ==Political geography== In 2008, the race in Kitchener was razor thin between the Conservatives and Liberals. Politically, the riding is split by the Conestoga Parkway. The area to the west of the Parkway tends to support the Liberals while the area to the east of the Parkway tends to vote for the Conservatives. The NDP also won a small handful of polls, scattered around the riding. ==History== The electoral district was created in 1996 from parts of Kitchener and Kitchener\u2014Waterloo ridings. It initially consisted of the part of the City of Kitchener bounded on the west by the western limit of the city, on the south by a line drawn from west to east along the Conestoga Parkway, Strasburg Road, Block Line Road, the Canadian Pacific Railway line, and Highway No. 8, on the east by the Grand River, and on the north by a line drawn from east to west along Victoria Street, Lawrence Avenue and Highland Road West. In 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Kitchener bounded on the west by the western limit of the city, on the north by a line drawn from west to east along Highland Road West, Fischer Hallman Road and the Canadian National Railway situated northerly of Shadeland Crescent, on the east by the Grand River, and on the south by a line drawn from east to west along the King Street Bypass (Highway No. 8), King Street East and the Conestoga Parkway. This riding lost territory to Kitchener\u2014Conestoga and Kitchener South\u2014Hespeler, and gained territory from Kitchener\u2014Waterloo during the 2012 electoral redistribution. ===Member of Parliament=== This riding has elected the following Member of Parliament: ==Election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | 2011 federal election redistributed resultsPundits' Guide to Canadian ElectionsElections Canada Downloadable XLS |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | % |- | | | Conservative ||align=right| 18,967 ||align=right| 40.36 |- | | | Liberal ||align=right| 15,175 ||align=right| 32.29 |- | | | New Democratic ||align=right| 10,305 ||align=right| 21.93 |- | | | Green ||align=right| 2,152 ||align=right| 4.58 |- | | | Others ||align=right| 396 ||align=right| 0.84 |} Note: Conservative vote is compared to the total of the Canadian Alliance vote and Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 election.
