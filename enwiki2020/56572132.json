    "text": "scrapers in the Moravian Museum, Czech Republic Bohunician industry was a paleolithic archeological industry in South-Central and East Europe. The artifacts assigned to this culture are dated between roughly 48,000 and 40,000 years ago. They were found at the type site of Brno-Bohunice, Str\u00e1nsk\u00e1 sk\u00e1la (Moravia), Bacho Kiro and Temnata Cave (Bulgaria), Dzierzyslaw (Poland), and others. The Bohunician is \"transitional\" between the Mousterian and the Aurignacian, and thus a candidate for representing the first wave of anatomically modern humans in Europe. Its technology resembles the Mousterian Levallois technique, as do the contemporary assemblages of the Szeletian (centered on the B\u00fckk Mountains of Hungary but also present in southern Poland) and the Uluzzian (Italy). Bohunician assemblages are considered similar to Emiran and Ahmarian ones and Bohunician culture may be linked to them. For this reason, it is thought likely that the Bohunician indicates the presence of anatomically modern humans, but this has not been corrobated by the discovery of any associated human remains. ==References== Category:Industries (lithics) Category:Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe Category:Archaeology of Central Europe Category:Peopling of Europe Category:Archaeology of the Czech Republic Category:Archaeology of Eastern Europe ",
