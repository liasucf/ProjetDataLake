The company that developed FoxyTunes was bought by Yahoo! in 2008, and FoxyTunes was closed in 2013. ==History== In 2004 computer science graduate student Alex Sirota was making Foxytunes available for free and accepting donations. The company behind Foxytunes was founded in 2005 by Vitaly and Alex Sirota with private investors and subsequently acquired by Yahoo! on February 4, 2008 for what was understood to be over , Yahoo! retaining the Foxytunes branding. On June 28, 2013, Yahoo! announced FoxyTunes's closure, scheduled for July 1, 2013. At its peak FoxyTunes was available in over 30 languages. ==Software== Foxytunes was controlled by a toolbar interface which was installed on the web browser. Supported web browsers and other applications included Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, SeaMonkey, Mozilla Application Suite, Flock and Mozilla Thunderbird. The extension supported the normal media player functions and displayed currently playing track information. In 2007 the FoxyTunes Planet rich media front page was launched. Additionally, the extension allowed searching various Web sites to get images, lyrics, videos, biographies etc. related to the music being played.
