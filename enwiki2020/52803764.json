The recordings took place at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio in Hollywood in October\u2013November 1968. Presley probably overdubbed his vocals on October 15. Takes 5 and 9 were spliced together to form the vocal master. == Release == The song was first released on a single (in March 1969) with \"Memories\", a song from Elvis' 1968 NBC TV comeback special, on the opposite side. \"Charro!\" didn't chart on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Memories\" charted, peaking at number 35. \"Charro\"'s first LP release was on the album Almost in Love in late 1970. On December 1, 1970 the single was re-released as part of RCA Victor's Gold Standard Series (together with 9 other Presley's singles). == Musical style and lyrics == It is a western-style song. == Track listing == 7\" single RCA 47-9731 (March 1969) # \"Memories\" # \"Charro\" == References == == External links == * * Elvis Presley \u2013 Charro / Memories at Discogs Category:1969 songs Category:1969 singles Category:Elvis Presley songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Songs written by Billy Strange Category:Songs written by Mac Davis Category:Songs written for films ",
