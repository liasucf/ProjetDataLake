Her lawyer Miguel (Barray) insists that the woman's two other grandchildren, Fifine (Stewart) and her brother Jean-Paul (Guers), be at the ch\u00e2teau for the reading of the will, even though they've been estranged from the family since an early age. When Fifine eventually arrives at the ch\u00e2teau, it isn't long before she falls for Miguel. In the meantime, Fifine's boyfriend Robert (Riberolles) shows up in the guise of her brother Jean-Paul, and finds himself very attracted to his girlfriend's cousin Mil\u00e9na. So, while Fifine goes after the lawyer, Robert is occupied with his own pursuits. The maid in the ch\u00e2teau, Prudence (Lafont), in turn, is undecided about whether to accept the lecherous overtures of the butler C\u00e9sar (Galabru), who has just hired her. ==Cast== * Fran\u00e7oise Brion \u2013 Mil\u00e9na Brett-Juval * Bernadette Lafont \u2013 Prudence * Alexandra Stewart \u2013 S\u00e9raphine Brett-Juval, aka Fifine * Michel Galabru \u2013 C\u00e9sar * Jacques Riberolles \u2013 Robert Godard * G\u00e9rard Barray \u2013 Miguel Baran * Paul Guers \u2013 Jean-Paul Brett-Juval * Florence Loinod \u2013 Florence ==Censorship== When L\u2019eau \u00e0 la bouche was first released in Italy in 1959, the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities rated the film suitable for people 16 years and older. In order for the film to be screened publicly, the committee recommended that the scene in which the maid and waiter are chasing each other should be cut at the moment when the maid's skirt is ripped. The committed also requested the removal of the scene in which Milena is undressing in her room. The reason for the age restriction, cited in the official documents, is because the subject of the movie is considered to be inappropriate to the sensitivity of a minor. The official document number is 32778, signed on 2 September 1960 by Minister Renzo Helfer. ==References== * Database of the documents produced by the Committee for the Theatrical Review of The Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, from 1944 to 2000. ==External links== * Category:French films Category:Films directed by Jacques Doniol-Valcroze Category:Films scored by Serge Gainsbourg ",
