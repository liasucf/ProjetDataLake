Kershen, University of Oklahoma College of Law.(2013) Retrieved 5 September 2019. https://works.bepress.com/drew_kershen/122/ The National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, defines sustainable agriculture \u201cas an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application\u201d Its purpose over the long-term is to: # satisfy human food and fiber needs # enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agriculture economy depends # make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls # sustain the economic viability of farm operations # enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole A more simple definition of sustainable agriculture suggested by UNESCO is \u201cproduction practices and systems which are environmentally sound and economically and socially viable.\u201d Therefore, \u201ccorresponding agricultural cropping systems and management practices would aim at high product quality standards and have an intergenerational time horizon.\u201dInternational ERSEC Conference on Resource Management for Sustainable Intensive Agriculture Systems: Promoting Environmentally-friendly Agricultural Production in China, 1st, Beijing, 2004, Unesco Digital Library.

In addition, rising per capita incomes, and the competing demand for biofuel crops; and the deficiencies of supply caused by rising input prices, land and water scarcity and deterioration, slowing productivity gains and climate change call for a better, more intensive and sustainable food production worldwide. Some of the key technologies suggested for a sustainable and high efficient use of agriculture re-sources include but are not limited to: * new kinds of fertilizers * degradable films for agricultural use * novel bio- regulators * soil conditioners * new water-saving equipment and new fertilizing equipment * high-efficient, water-saving tools for increasing yields Relevant technologies also include integrated management of crop disease, pests and mice, comprehensive control of major animal diseases, preventing and reducing climate disaster in ag-riculture, developing and producing of new pesticides, biological herbicides and vaccines.Qu Dongyu, The Role of Science and Technology in Developing Intensive and Sustainable Agriculture in China in International ERSEC Conference on Resource Management for Sustainable Intensive Agriculture Systems: Promoting Environmentally- friendly Agricultural Production in China, 1st, Beijing, 2004, Unesco Digital Library.
