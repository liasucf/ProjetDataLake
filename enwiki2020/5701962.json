Dob\u00f3 was a member of the Hungarian land-owning nobility, with holdings in northern Hungary. In the dynastic succession struggles after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, Dob\u00f3 was consistently on the side of the Habsburg King Ferdinand I rather than that of John Z\u00e1polya. ==Life== Dob\u00f3 was the son of Domonkos (Dominic) Dob\u00f3, who married Zs\u00f3fia (Sophie) C\u00e9kei in 1498. There were six children from the marriage: Ferenc, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, Istv\u00e1n, Domokos, Anna and Katalin. Istv\u00e1n Dob\u00f3's own wife was S\u00e1ra Sulyok, whom he married on 17 Oct.1550. They had three children: Ferenc, Damj\u00e1n and Krisztina. Dob\u00f3 became the commander of Eger Castle in 1549. He became famous as a result of his successful defence of the castle during the Siege of Eger in 1552 (celebrated in G\u00e9za G\u00e1rdonyi's classic novel Eclipse of the Crescent Moon), in which 2100 defenders were able to withstand the onslaught of 80,000 Ottoman soldiers. As a reward, Ferdinand donated to Dob\u00f3 the ownership of the Transylvanian castles of D\u00e9va (now Deva, Romania) and Szamos\u00fajv\u00e1r (now Gherla, Romania). Dob\u00f3 was also appointed as voivod (viceroy) of Transylvania in 1553. When Transylvania was separated from Hungary in 1556, Dob\u00f3 was given ownership of the castle of L\u00e9va (now: Levice, Slovakia) in compensation. Accused of treason against the King, Dob\u00f3 spent several years imprisoned in the castle of Pozsony (now Bratislava, Slovakia). His health was seriously impaired by his imprisonment, and he died in his home soon after his release from captivity. ==References== Category:1500s births Category:1572 deaths Category:People from Uzhhorod Raion Category:Voivodes of Transylvania Category:Hungarian soldiers Category:16th-century soldiers Category:People from Eger Category:16th-century Hungarian nobility Category:Hungarian landowners ",
