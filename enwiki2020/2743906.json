It was surveyed by the British Naval Hydrographic Survey Unit in 1956\u20131957. The name arose because the island lies halfway between Arthur Harbor and Cape Monaco, a route frequently traveled by boat by members of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) at the Arthur Harbor station. ==See also== * Composite Antarctic Gazetteer * List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S * SCAR * Territorial claims in Antarctica ==References== ==External links== Category:Islands of the Palmer Archipelago ",
