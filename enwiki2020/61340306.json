    "text": "The 2020 Puerto Rico gubernatorial election will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the governor of Puerto Rico, concurrently with the election of the Resident Commissioner, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the mayors of the 78 municipalities. Incumbent New Progressive Party Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, who succeeded to the governorship on August 7, 2019, is eligible to run for a full term in office, which she announced she would do on December 16, 2019. However she lost her bid when former Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi won the New Progressive Party membership vote on the nomination for governor. ==New Progressive Party== On March 3, 2019, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced he would seek re-election as governor in the 2020 elections; however, following the Telegramgate scandal and subsequent protests in front of La Fortaleza, Rossell\u00f3 announced on July 21, 2019, that he would withdraw his bid for re-election. Shortly thereafter, on August 2, he resigned as governor. On September 9, 2019, Pedro Pierluisi, who served briefly as de facto governor following Rossell\u00f3's resignation, announced he would seek the PNP nomination for governor for the 2020 elections. On December 19, 2019, Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, who was elevated to governor on August 7, 2019, after Pierluisi's appointment was deemed unconstitutional, announced her intention to seek re-election to a full term as governor. On August 16, 2020, in an extended primary process marred by troubles delivering ballots to polling places for the original primary date of August 9, Pierluisi defeated V\u00e1zquez Garced. ===Candidates=== ====Nominated==== *Pedro Pierluisi, former Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico ====Eliminated in primary==== *Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, incumbent Governor ====Withdrawn==== *Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, former Governor of Puerto Rico *Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Cancel, former Secretary of Health of Puerto Rico and PNP candidate for the 2012 Puerto Rico gubernatorial election ===Polling=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\" |- valign=bottom !
