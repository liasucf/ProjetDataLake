It is a polymorph of the aromatic hydrocarbon fluorene. It forms white, yellow to brown crystals in the orthorhombic system which occur often as a druzey encrustation. It has a specific gravity of 1.21 and a Mohs hardness of 1 to 2. It was first described from the Nejedly mine in Bohemia, Czech Republic in 1937. ==References== Category:Organic minerals ",
