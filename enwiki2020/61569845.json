The library is located in Haining, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China, with a main building located in 60-62 Xuelin Street and 11 branches and tens of circulation points located in all the towns and sub-districts under Haining. As of August 2018, the library contains 1.7 million item. It is ranked as National First Class Library by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China. The Library's history can date back to 1904 when Haining Zhou Library () was founded as the first county-level library to use the Chinese term \"\u56fe\u4e66\u9986/\u5716\u66f8\u9928\" in China. In 30 June 1956, the Library was renamed as Haining County Library () in Chinese. After Haining was designated as a county-level city in February 1987, the Library was renamed as Haining City Library (). Haining Library was the first county- level public library in China and was known as one of the most beautiful basic-level libraries in China. == History == === Foundation and early development === The Library's history can date back to 1904, when Haining Zhou Library () was founded as the first county-level library to use the Chinese term \"\u56fe\u4e66\u9986/\u5716\u66f8\u9928\" in China. The establishment of the Library was proposed by eight of local scholar-gentry, including Zhu Ding () and Zhou Chengde (), and was approved in the fourth month of that year in Chinese calendar. On its foundation, the Library was in Shuixian Pavilion () which was the west wing of Haishen Temple () in Yanguan, the seat of Haining Zhou at that time. A chapter containing 44 articles defined the purposes of the Library, the rules for funding and book management. The fund of the Library was from the income of sharecropping and the donation to the temple. Yet, with the founders of the Library leaving Haining due to various reasons, a local called Zhu Baojin () relocated the Library in the ground floor of a building next to the gate of Magong Temple () near the East Gate of Yanguan. In 1915, Haining County Public Library () was founded, using the buildings of Haining Zhou Library, Old Academy (), Anlan Shuyuan (). Zhu Zonglai (), who was educated in Japan, was appointed as the president of the Library by the county government, with a public fund of 200 Silver Yuan annually. The Library then set up an room for epigraphic collections. In 1918, the Library set up a department for collection of popular books whose themes included politics, literature and arts, technologies and techniques, etc. In 1930, the local government of Haining founded the Public Education Centre of Haining, and made the Library the Book Department of the Centre. From August 1931 to August 1932, four libraries affiliated to the Public Education Centre were set up in four towns under Haining (Xiashi, Yuanhua, Chang'an, Xieqiao). In November 1931, Haining Public Library became independent from the Centre, yet Bi Fuyun () remained president of both the Centre and the Library. After Japan occupied Haining in 1937, the Library ceased to operate. === Re-establishment after the war === Xiashi Railway Station in 1920. The Library moved next to the station in 1963. In 1947, the Public Education Centre was re-established in Xiashi, with an affiliated newspaper room. People's Liberation Army occupied Haining in May 1945. Haining Youth Club was founded, with a newspaper reading room as well. In March 1950, the Youth Club was replaced by the People's Culture Centre of Haining County (). In February 1953, the Centre was renamed to the Culture Centre of Haining County (). On 9 May 1956, People's Committee of Haining County held a joint conference with the Youth League, workers' union, and other 11 groups, during which a committee in prepare for the establishment of a county library was resolved to be formed. On 30 June, Haining County Library was established and open to the public at Zhongning Alley (), Xiashi. Weng Gongyou (), the then president of the Culture Centre, was assigned as the president of both facilities. In January 1957, the Library set up an children's reading room. In April 1958, the Library was merged into the Culture Centre, the right to use the name of the Library was given to the Centre. In the same month, Xiashi Library, a private library, was founded. Yet, Xiashi Library was renamed to the Library of Xiashi People's commune in October 1958, and was merged into Haining County Library in 1961. === During the Cultural Revolution === In November 1958, with Haiyan County merged into Haining County, the Library annexed the public libraries Haiyan. However, in 1961, the libraries became separated again when Haiyan re-gained countyhood. In 1962\u201363, the Library first moved to the ground floor of the building of the county broadcast station, and then it was settled down in Huili Temple (), yet the room for preservation of ancient books remained unchanged. With the Cultural Revolution's outbreak in 1966, the checkout service was closed, although the reading room was still open to the public. The reading room was relocated to Xiaxi Street after the police division of the revolution headquarter occupied Huili Temple in 1967, and moved to Zhongning Alley in 1968. In 1969, the reading room was renamed to the Propaganda Station for Mao Zedong Thoughts in Haining County. In the winter of 1970, the Library moved to Huili Temple, again. On 27 January 1971, the Library reopened the book checkout service, distributing 1,000 reader cards. In 1974, Jinxing Building in back of Huili Temple was built as a new library building. === 1980s and 1990s === On 28 October 1982, the Planning and Economic Commission and Finance Office of Haining approved the construction of a 200-square-metre stack room with a budget of 20 thousand RMB for the Library but this was not carried out at that time. On 14 May 1984, Planning and Economic Commission approved the construction of a stack room and a reading room, with a total area of 933 square metres and a total budget of 97.9 thousand RMB, but this was not being done either. On 22 October 1984, the Library became a separate government agency and in November, it cancelled the number restriction on the distribution of reader cards. On 2 January 1985, Zhang Jingfu () and Chen Boliang (), two members of local PCC, proposed that the Library should be constructed in a new site other than Zhongning Alley. The People's Government of Haining held a meeting, and resolved to acquire 7 mu of land and to build a library with a total building area of 3,000 square metres. On 6 June, the local Planning and Economic Commission approved this resolution, ratifying a budget of 700,000 RMB. The project started in October, carried out by Fengtu Construction Company of Haining. The construction of the building started on 25 December, yet was stopped due to technical problems of the foundation work. In February 1987, Haining was designated as a county-level city. Haining County Library was renamed to Haining City Library. On 18 May 1988, the construction of the new library buildings was finished, for which a ceremony was held at the governmental guest house of Haining. The moving of the Library started on 23 January. The checkout service, newspaper rooms, and reference reading rooms became open to the public on 20 August. The moving ended up with an opening ceremony of the new buildings on 8 October, with the old building out of service. The new buildings cost 1.55 million RMB and had a floor area of 3229 square metres. The Library, covering an area of 8 mu, had a 4-storey main building containing a stack room with a mezzanine, and 2-storey subsidiary buildings. The buildings were encompassed by trees.

The sculpture outside of the main building, which is inscribed with the logo of the Library and the Core Socialist Values In 2009, the Library began planning for the construction of new library buildings, with a budget of 87.6 million RMB. The plan was later listed in the 11th 5-year plan of Haining City. In September, Wang Wei, Chief Architect of the Design Institute of Landscape and Architecture, China Academy of Art, was invited by the Library to design the new buildings. After 2-month visit to Haining from Hangzhou, Wang Wei finished the draft design of the new buildings and he was formally appointed to design the building in February 2010. Yet, the original blueprint was never carried out for its high difficulty in construction. Wang Wei proposed another 10 new blueprints for the buildings.
