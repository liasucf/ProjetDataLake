Original military designation explains the buildings over 183 cm (6 feet) wide walls. It was built on the site of a female monastic community dating back to the 1540s \u2014 the Voznesenskyi (Ascension) Pechersk monastery. A major patroness of the monastery in the early 18th century was Hetman Ivan Mazepa's mother \u2014 Mariia Magdalyna. One of the galleries of the Mystetskyi Arsenal as seen following initial renovation works Two churches that existed on the site of the monastery were subsequently dismantled to allow for the construction of the military workshop, however their foundations remained and were excavated in 2005 in preparation for the opening of the Mystetskyi Arsenal to the public. The excavation revealed a major necropolis containing hundreds of burials of nuns and the presumed body of Mariia Magdalyna, as well as a host of special value objects dating back as early as the 1300s. Construction of the current building was supervised by a military engineer by the name of Charles de Chardon, a native of Dohis, Aisne, Hauts-de-France, who was then living in Kyiv. The structure was subsequently completed by a local Ukrainian merchant by the name of Mykhailo Hryhorenko. The Arsenal building was awarded an architectural heritage monument status in 1979 and continued to be in use by the armed forces through the beginning of the 21st century. Large scale archaeological excavations took place in the inner courtyard between 2005 and 2009. In 2010 the entire complex was granted a National monument status and conservation works are continuing while the facility remains open to the public. ==Permanent programs== * Laboratory of Modern Visual Arts * Literary Laboratory * Theatrical Laboratory * Summer Nights * Museum Activities & Exhibition ==See also== * Museums in Kyiv ==References== ==External links== * Category:Museums in Kyiv ",
