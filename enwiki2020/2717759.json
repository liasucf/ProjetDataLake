    "text": "Joseph S. Benigno (born September 26, 1953) is an American sports radio personality. He co-hosts the Joe & Evan show with Evan Roberts weekdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET on the New York radio stations WFAN-AM and WFAN-FM. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Benigno, who is of Italian descent, was born in Garfield, New Jersey and grew up in nearby Paramus. He graduated from Franklin College in 1975 with a degree in political science. Prior to joining WFAN, Benigno was a frequent caller to the station and was known on-air as \"Joe from Saddle River.\" ===Professional radio career=== His first taste of radio experience occurred in 1994, when he guest-hosted a show on WFAN as a result of winning a contest held by the station. He then hosted a sports-talk show on a radio station in Elizabeth, New Jersey before returning to WFAN as their overnight host in 1995. He continued as overnight host until November 2004, when he was moved to middays to co-host with Sid Rosenberg after Rosenberg's previous co-host, Jody McDonald, did not have his contract renewed with the station. After Rosenberg resigned from the station on September 12, 2005, Benigno became the sole host of the midday show until January, 2007, when he was then paired with Evan Roberts. Benigno also co-hosts Daily News Live on SNY. Benigno was filling in for the vacationing Boomer and Carton in the Morning program on March 28, 2013 with his partner Roberts when he made disparaging remarks about having to get makeup done. The program is simulcast on MSG and Benigno continued by mocking them, claiming that he was annoyed about the chair time required for MSG's \"11 viewers.\" The Benigno & Roberts show scheduled to be broadcast on Good Friday via MSG was immediately cancelled. On April 25, 2013, Benigno faced widespread criticism for saying he would \"buy drugs for Tyrann Mathieu\" if the New York Jets drafted him. ===Personal life=== Benigno is an avid fan of the New York Mets, New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and most notably the New York Jets. He is known for quotes such as \"Oh, the pain!\" (a lift from the character Dr Smith of Lost in Space), \"How 'bout that?\", and \"What a disaster\" when describing his losing teams, as well as \"Bro\", \"stellar\", and \"All The Love\". Benigno often makes light of his uncanny resemblance to professional baseball player Sal Fasano, Count Dracula, and Hollywood actor Vincent Schiavelli. Released his first book in April 2010, titled \"Rules for New York Sports Fans.\" On July 18, 2018, a lawsuit was filed by former WFAN employee Lauren Lockwood alleging, among other things, \"WFAN host Joe Benigno pressured her into having a threesome.\" Additionally, Benigno \"whispered in [Lockwood\u2019s] ear about having \u2018threesomes\u2019 with him and his wife and prostitutes.\"https://nypost.com/2018/07/18/wfan- host-joe-benigno-accused-of-sexual-harassment/amp/ In response to the lawsuit, Benigno took an indefinite leave of absence from the station which lasted for the remainder of the summer. He returned on a regular basis on September 10, 2018. He currently resides in Mahwah, New Jersey. ==References== ==External links== * Joe Benigno \u00ab CBS New York * Category:1953 births Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Living people Category:People from Garfield, New Jersey Category:People from Old Tappan, New Jersey Category:People from Paramus, New Jersey Category:Paramus High School alumni Category:SportsNet New York Category:Franklin College (Indiana) alumni Category:American sports radio personalities ",
