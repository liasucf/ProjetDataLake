    "text": "Woodland Echoes is the seventh solo album by English singer-songwriter Nick Heyward. It was released on 4 August 2017 on Gladsome Hawk Records. He has described it as accidentally biographical and influenced by \"love, nature, togetherness, \u201870s\u2019 pop, America, open spaces and afternoon tea\". ==Singles== The first single is a double A-side with the songs 'Baby Blue Sky' and 'Mountaintop' and was released on 30 June 2017. The video for 'Baby Blue Sky' was exclusively premiered by Music-News.com on 18 July 2017. The second single, 'Perfect Sunday Sun', was premiered by Billboard on 31 October 2017. Heyward describes the song as \"my interpretation of indecision, idealism and havering \u2013 a kind of trilogy, like Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's Three Colours film series\". \"It starts off in Richmond, goes to Bedford Falls in _It's A Wonderful Life_ , to San Francisco to Hitchcock\". 'The Stars', described by Mojo magazine as a top 10 single and the best track on the album, was announced as the third single in conjunction with Record Store Day UK on 6 March 2018. It will be available on 10\" vinyl with an exclusive b-side, 'Everyone & Everything'. ==Critical reception== Rated at 82 in Metacritic's Best Albums of 2017, it's described as a \"tonic for life\" and \"an aural injection of Vitamin D.\" The album's pastoral sound and unmistakable Englishness has garnered comparisons to Lennon and McCartney, Paul Weller and Teenage Fanclub. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Nick Heyward \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, keyboards, glockenspiel, wood saw, whisk * Matt Backer \u2013 electric guitar, slide guitar * Denis Blackham \u2013 mastering * Anthony Clark \u2013 organ, strings, keyboards, Hammond organ, Rhodes piano * Blair Cunningham \u2013 drums * Claire Finley \u2013 backing vocals * Oliver Heyward \u2013 producer, bass * Ericson Holt \u2013 Hammond organ, piano * Joey Marchiano \u2013 drums * Ryan Robinson \u2013 electric guitar, slide guitar * Ian Shaw \u2013 producer, drum/percussion programming (on \"Mountaintop\") * Chris Sheldon \u2013 mixing * Simon Taylor \u2013 saxophone (on \"Who?\") * Phillip Taylor \u2013 producer, double bass, bass guitar, keyboards, drum programming * Alisa Walker \u2013 fiddle (on \"Mountaintop\") ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- | UK Vinyl Albums (OCC) | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 32 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 albums Category:Nick Heyward albums ",
