It was a very important mining location for sulfur. After a disastrous explosion in the 1970s, the mine was abandoned and many of its residents emigrated elsewhere including the United States of America. Hacienda of Guaxcama Guaxcama Sulfur Mine ==History== In 1808 a German company had begun mining the area for sulfur. Years later Mariano Ni\u00f1o purchased the rights to the mines. More recently on November 18, 1972 an explosion occurred in one of the mines. Reporter Roberto Silva, for El Sol de San Luis, advised that one was able to see the flames of the fires from the outskirts of the capital, San Luis Potos\u00ed, about 70 kilometers away. The fire was not extinguished for days. Astonishingly there were no deaths. The mines are now abandoned and the adjacent buildings, including a chapel, are now in ruins. ==Bibliography== Roque, Alexandro (2004) Villa Ju\u00e1rez, La bella villa, CNCA/Secretar\u00eda de Cultura de SLP/ Ayuntamiento de Villa Ju\u00e1rez http://delmineralguaxcama.blogspot.mx/2012/11/arden-las-minas-de-guaxcama.html Category:Populated places in San Luis Potos\u00ed ",
