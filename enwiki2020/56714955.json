    "text": "The 1896 United States presidential election in Idaho took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president. ==Background== Idaho, upon its organization as a territory overwhelmingly Democratic,Owens, Kenneth N.; \u2018Pattern and Structure in Western Territorial Politics\u2019; Western Historical Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1970), pp. 373-392 had been increasingly dominated by the Republican Party in the years leading up to statehood, as ex-Southern and Mormon mining settlers were increasingly outweighed by those from the Midwest.Weatherby, James B. and Stapilus, Randy; Governing Idaho: Politics, People and Power, pp. 35-36 The state Democratic Party would regroup and its pro-silver, anti-Mormon faction under Marshal Fred T. Dubois would bring the state into the Union in the late 1880s. Upon statehood, Idaho was shaken by a wave of strikes in the silver-mining regionsKennedy, David M. and Cohen, Lizabeth; American Pageant, Volume 2, p. 506 and even deeper conflict whereby an idled ore concentrator was destroyed in Gem.Schwantes, Carlos A.; The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive History, p. 343 This, alongside opposition to Republican Governor Norman Bushnell Willey\u2019s declaration of martial law upon the miners, and against the absentee ownership of Idaho's land and water,Larson, Robert W.; \u2018Populism in the Mountain West: A Mainstream Movement\u2019; Western Historical Quarterly, vol. 13, no. 2 (April 1982), pp. 143-164 would turn the state's electorate strongly towards the Populist leader James B. Weaver, who carried the state in 1892 in an election where Gold Democrat and former President Grover Cleveland was not even on the ballot. As the 1896 election approached, it was clear that silver politics would be the determining factor in Idaho's vote,Johnson, Claudius O.; \u2018The Story of Silver Politics in Idaho, 1892-1902\u2019; The Pacific Northwest Quarterly, vol. 33, no. 3 (July 1942), pp. 283-296 and that the state would not vote for any candidate opposing free silver. Senator Fred T. Dubois, who had been a critical player in giving Idaho statehood, confirmed this in June. When William Jennings Bryan gained the Democratic nomination on a platform favouring the coinage of silver at 16:1 relative to gold, the Populist Party supported him throughout the country.Case, Matthew H. and Sprague, Alan F. (1982); Northwest Frontier, p. 257 To absolutely squash any doubts as to where Idaho's electoral votes would go, Dubois, realizing the vital importance, of silver, crossed lines to make Bryan the \u201cRepublican\u201d candidate,The Society (1974); State Historic Preservation Plan, Idaho, Volume 1, p. 72 although the Republican State Convention was to endorse and place on the ballot national nominees William McKinley and Garrett Hobart.Beal, Merrill D. and Wells; Merle W. (1959); History of Idaho - Volume 2, p. 438 ==Vote== Idaho was won by the Democratic/Populist nominees, William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. Bryan won every county, and only in three of twenty-one did McKinley crack a quarter of the vote. Despite half a century of overwhelming Republican dominance, no presidential nominee has equalled Bryan's performance in the state. Bryan would later defeat McKinley again in Idaho four year later but would later lose the state to William Howard Taft in 1908. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" !
