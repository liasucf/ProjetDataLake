It's located in the northwest side of Pre\u0161ov and has a population of 19,551 (2014). It is divided into 3 parts, namely S\u00eddlisko III A, S\u00eddlisko III B and Mlados\u0165. The main traffic artery of the housing estate is a road running in the north-south direction, which is formed by Prost\u011bjovsk\u00e1 and Volgogradsk\u00e1 streets. == History and present == Construction of panel buildings (panel\u00e1ks or commieblocks) began in 1962 and ended in the early 1990s. Between 1990 and 1994, 'Kostol Panny M\u00e1rie Kr\u00e1\u013eovnej Pokoja' (Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace) was built in the housing estate. In 2008, an apartment building on Bajkalsk\u00e1 street was completed, containing 16 residential units. Apartments Ast\u00f3ria were completed in 2015 and in 2016 the apartment complex Apartments Torysa on Muka\u010devsk\u00e1 street was completed. In 2017, the Na trojke project was completed, which was created after demolishing a dilapidated hospital at the same exact place, and a complex of four multifunctions Biko\u0161 apartment buildings is also under construction, with a planned completion in 2020. As of today, old apartment buildings are getting gentrified and painted, and modern apartment buildings might get built in this housing estate. Na trojke is an example of a modern looking apartment building in this housing estate. In recent years, individual housing construction is getting built the Kr\u00e1\u013eova hora district, where several new streets have been added. Currently, this construction is being expanded as part of the Kr\u00e1\u013eova hora project, and a new district of family houses is also under construction on the edge of the housing estate above Prost\u011bjovsk\u00e1 Street, not far from the final public transport stop (MHD). On 6 December 2019, there was a gas explosion in the apartment building on Muka\u010devsk\u00e1 no. 7, in which 8 citizens were tragically killed. It was one of the greatest misfortunes of its kind in the modern history of Slovakia, some, such as Mons. Bernard Bober, named it Pre\u0161ovsk\u00e1 trag\u00e9dia (Pre\u0161ov Tragedy). An unprecedented wave of solidarity arose after the disaster, citizens of Pre\u0161ov flocked to the collection centers everything the families in need needed, and three days after the disaster, more than 1.4 million euros were raised to help the city of Pre\u0161ov. == See also == *Panel\u00e1k and S\u00eddlisko (Czech Republic and Slovakia) *Panelh\u00e1z (Hungary) *Plattenbau (Germany) *Khrushchyovka (Former Soviet Union) *Public housing *Housing estate *Affordable housing *Subsidized housing *HLM (France) *Million Programme (Sweden) == References == Category:Pre\u0161ov Category:Slovakia ",
