    "text": "In statistical mechanics, the Darwin\u2013Fowler method is used for deriving the distribution functions with mean probability. It was developed by Charles Galton Darwin and Ralph H. Fowler in 1922\u20131923. Distribution functions are used in statistical physics to estimate the mean number of particles occupying an energy level (hence also called occupation numbers). These distributions are mostly derived as those numbers for which the system under consideration is in its state of maximum probability. But one really requires average numbers. These average numbers can be obtained by the Darwin\u2013Fowler method. Of course, for systems in the thermodynamic limit (large number of particles), as in statistical mechanics, the results are the same as with maximization. ==Darwin\u2013Fowler method== In most texts on statistical mechanics the statistical distribution functions f in Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics) are derived by determining those for which the system is in its state of maximum probability. But one really requires those with average or mean probability, although \u2013 of course \u2013 the results are usually the same for systems with a huge number of elements, as is the case in statistical mechanics. The method for deriving the distribution functions with mean probability has been developed by C. G. Darwin and FowlerC.G. Darwin and R.H. Fowler, Phil. Mag. 44(1922) 450\u2013479, 823\u2013842. and is therefore known as the Darwin\u2013Fowler method. This method is the most reliable general procedure for deriving statistical distribution functions. Since the method employs a selector variable (a factor introduced for each element to permit a counting procedure) the method is also known as the Darwin\u2013Fowler method of selector variables. Note that a distribution function is not the same as the probability \u2013 cf. Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, Bose\u2013Einstein distribution, Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution. Also note that the distribution function f_i which is a measure of the fraction of those states which are actually occupied by elements, is given by f_i = n_i/g_i or n_i= f_ig_i, where g_i is the degeneracy of energy level i of energy \\varepsilon_i and n_i is the number of elements occupying this level (e.g. in Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics 0 or 1). Total energy E and total number of elements N are then given by E = \\sum_i n_i\\varepsilon_i and N = \\sum n_i. The Darwin\u2013Fowler method has been treated in the texts of E. Schr\u00f6dinger,E. Schr\u00f6dinger, Statistical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press (1952). FowlerR.H. Fowler, Statistical Mechanics, Cambridge University Press (1952). and Fowler and E. A. Guggenheim,R.H.

M\u00fcller\u2013Kirsten, Basics of Statistical Physics, 2nd ed., World Scientific (2013), . The method is also discussed and used for the derivation of Bose\u2013Einstein condensation in the book of .R. B. Dingle, Asymptotic Expansions: Their Derivation and Interpretation, Academic Press (1973); pp. 267\u2013271. ==Classical statistics== For N=\\sum_in_i independent elements with n_i on level with energy \\varepsilon_i and E=\\sum_in_i\\varepsilon_i for a canonical system in a heat bath with temperature T we set : Z = \\sum_\\text{arrangements}e^{-E/kT} = \\sum_\\text{arrangements}\\prod_iz_i^{n_i}, \\;\\;\\; z_i = e^{-\\varepsilon_i/kT}. The average over all arrangements is the mean occupation number : (n_i)_\\text{av} = \\frac{\\sum_jn_jZ}{Z} = z_j\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_j}\\ln Z. Insert a selector variable \\omega by setting : Z_\\omega = \\sum \\prod_i(\\omega z_i)^{n_i}. In classical statistics the N elements are (a) distinguishable and can be arranged with packets of n_i elements on level \\varepsilon_i whose number is : \\frac{N!}{\\prod_in_i!}, so that in this case : Z_\\omega = N!\\sum_{n_i}\\prod_i\\frac{(\\omega z_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}. Allowing for (b) the degeneracy g_i of level \\varepsilon_i this expression becomes : Z_\\omega = N!\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\sum_{n_i=0,1,2,\\ldots}\\frac{(\\omega z_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}\\right)^{g_i} = N!e^{\\omega\\sum_ig_iz_i}. The selector variable \\omega allows to pick out the coefficient of \\omega^N which is Z. Thus : Z = \\left(\\sum_ig_iz_i\\right)^N, and hence : (n_j)_\\text{av} = z_j\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_j}\\ln Z = N\\frac{g_je^{-\\varepsilon_j/kT}}{\\sum_ig_ie^{-\\varepsilon_i/kT}}. This result which agrees with the most probable value obtained by maximization does not involve a single approximation and is therefore exact, and thus demonstrates the power of this Darwin\u2013Fowler method. ==Quantum statistics== We have as above : Z_{\\omega}=\\sum\\prod (\\omega z_i)^{n_i}, \\;\\; z_i=e^{-\\varepsilon_i/kT}, where n_i is the number of elements in energy level \\varepsilon_i. Since in quantum statistics elements are indistinguishable no preliminary calculation of the number of ways of dividing elements into packets n_1, n_2, n_3, ... is required. Therefore the sum \\sum refers only to the sum over possible values of n_i. In the case of Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics we have : n_i=0 or n_i=1 per state. There are g_i states for energy level \\varepsilon_i. Hence we have : Z_\\omega=(1+\\omega z_1)^{g_1}(1+\\omega z_2)^{g_2}\\cdots=\\prod(1+\\omega z_i)^{g_i}. In the case of Bose\u2013Einstein statistics we have : n_i=0,1,2,3, \\ldots \\infty. By the same procedure as before we obtain in the present case :Z_{\\omega}=(1+\\omega z_1+(\\omega z_1)^2 + (\\omega z_1)^3 + \\cdots)^{g_1}(1+\\omega z_2 + (\\omega z_2)^2 + \\cdots)^{g_2} \\cdots. But :1 + \\omega z_1 + (\\omega z_1)^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{(1 - \\omega z_1)}. Therefore : Z_\\omega=\\prod_i(1-\\omega z_i)^{-g_i}. Summarizing both cases and recalling the definition of Z, we have that Z is the coefficient of \\omega^N in : Z_\\omega=\\prod_i(1\\pm \\omega z_i)^{\\pm g_i}, where the upper signs apply to Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics, and the lower signs to Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. Next we have to evaluate the coefficient of \\omega^N in Z_\\omega. In the case of a function \\phi(\\omega) which can be expanded as : \\phi(\\omega) = a_0 + a_1\\omega + a_2\\omega^2 + \\cdots, the coefficient of \\omega^N is, with the help of the residue theorem of Cauchy, : a_N = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint \\frac{\\phi(\\omega)d\\omega}{\\omega^{N+1}}. We note that similarly the coefficient Z in the above can be obtained as : Z=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint\\frac{Z_{\\omega}}{\\omega^{N+1}}d\\omega\\equiv \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int e^{f(\\omega)}d\\omega, where : f(\\omega)=\\pm\\sum_ig_i\\ln (1\\pm \\omega z_i)-(N+1)\\ln\\omega. Differentiating one obtains : f'(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\left[\\sum_i\\frac{g_i}{(\\omega z_i)^{-1}\\pm 1}-(N+1)\\right], and : f(\\omega) = \\frac{N+1}{\\omega^2}\\mp \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}\\sum_i\\frac{g_i}{[(\\omega z_i)^{-1}\\pm 1]^2}. One now evaluates the first and second derivatives of f(\\omega) at the stationary point \\omega_0 at which f'(\\omega_0)=0.. This method of evaluation of Z around the saddle point \\omega_0is known as the method of steepest descent. One then obtains : Z = \\frac{e^{f(\\omega_0)}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi f(\\omega_0)}}. We have f'(\\omega_0) = 0 and hence :N (+1) = \\sum_i\\frac{g_i}{(\\omega_0z_i)^{-1}\\pm 1} (the +1 being negligible since N is large). We shall see in a moment that this last relation is simply the formula : N = \\sum_in_i. We obtain the mean occupation number (n_i)_{av} by evaluating :(n_j)_{av} = z_j\\frac{d}{dz_j}\\ln Z = \\frac{g_j}{(\\omega_0z_j)^{-1}\\pm 1} = \\frac{g_j}{e^{(\\varepsilon_j-\\mu)/kT} \\pm 1}, \\quad e^{\\mu/kT}= \\omega_0. This expression gives the mean number of elements of the total of N in the volume V which occupy at temperature T the 1-particle level \\varepsilon_j with degeneracy g_j (see e.g. a priori probability). For the relation to be reliable one should check that higher order contributions are initially decreasing in magnitude so that the expansion around the saddle point does indeed yield an asymptotic expansion. ==Further reading== * ==References== * * * * Category:Statistical mechanics ",
