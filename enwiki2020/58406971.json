    "text": "George from the kindred P\u00e9c (; died after 1256) was a Hungarian noble in the first half of the 13th century, who served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County from 1243 to 1244. ==Biography== George originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. His father was Lucas, a staunch supporter of King Andrew II of Hungary,Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) who presumably served as Master of the cupbearers in the royal court from 1229 to 1230 and also held various isp\u00e1nates. George had two brothers: Mark I and Lucas II (also known as Lucas the Great). George had three sons from his unidentified marriage; Denis was an influential baron and skilled military leader during the second half of the 13th century, while Serfesd and Peter, who were referred with the surname Nevnai and Ludbregi after their residence, present-day Levanjska Varo\u0161 and Ludbreg, respectively, remained landowners among the local nobility along the Drava River. George's branch became extinct after two generations. George is first referred by contemporary records in 1232, when he appears as a witness in the so-called Kehida Diploma. The lawsuit between baron Atyusz III Atyusz and royal servants in Zala County, and its consequences proved to be the first milestone towards the noble self-determination. George possessed large-scale landholdings and estates in the northwest corner of Slavonia, the borderland of Zala, Vara\u017edin (Varasd) and Kri\u017eevci (K\u0151r\u00f6s) counties. He was a confidant of B\u00e9la IV of Hungary. He served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County from 1243 to 1244. His deputy (\"curialis comes\") was a certain Ezen in 1244. For his service, George was granted Ludbreg sometimes before 1248, as B\u00e9la IV referred to him \"neighbor lord\" during an act of land donation near Koprivnica. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson Nicholas Ludbregi in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban John Cs\u00faz and his descendants. It is presumable that George functioned as isp\u00e1n of Kri\u017eevci (or K\u0151r\u00f6s) County from around 1252 to 1253. George filed a lawsuit for the ownership of Tursoy, an island on the Drava river, in 1256. His efforts failed, the land was granted to the hospes (foreign \"guest settlers\") of Vara\u017edin. This is the last piece of information about him. His son Denis entered political career in the same year. == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people George ",
