He gained notoriety after he contracted the HIV virus and infected three pornographic actresses in 2004. ==Discovery of infection and aftermath== In an attempt to prevent a possible outbreak, an urgent search was initiated for potentially infected performers. The search and subsequent testing were conducted by the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, where James had received his diagnosis. It was concluded that James had possibly been infected while engaging in unprotected anal sex with Brazilian actress Bianca Biaggi during a scene for the video Split That Booty 2 in Rio de Janeiro.AVN :: Test Results Pending for Two Performers It was discovered that three actresses who had worked with James shortly after his return to the United States had also become infected: Canadian newcomer Lara Roxx, Mareisa Arroyo, and Czech-born Jessica Dee.
