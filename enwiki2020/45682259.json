    "text": "Tom Middleton is a former Canadian pop singer.http://www.canadianbands.com/Tom%20Middleton.html The Victoria, British Columbia native first got a taste of the rock life while with The Marquis in 1967, which featured Jerry Adophe (later of Chilliwack and Jim Byrnes), Len Knoke, Norm Piercy, and Gary Garraway. They toured BC while playing the popular covers of the day and graduated to the 'B' circuit across western Canada until they broke up in '69. He struck out on his own, becoming a mainstay on the Vancouver circuit while writing material. He continued on the road across BC and the prairies when he hooked up with manager Howard Leese in '72. After signing a deal with Columbia Records, they went into the studio with producer Mike Flicker, and the result was \"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\", on the shelves in May of '73 which was released in Canada and Stateside. The title track, backed with \"Lovelight Suite,\" made a decent impression on the charts at home, cracking the Canadian top 40 for a month. Like the title track, \"Just One Victory,\" was written by Todd Rundgren, but didn't make it past #65 . A third single was cut, \"One More Chance,\" backed with \"Name of the Game,\" which also stalled short of the top 40. He released his sophomore record, \"One Night Lovers\" in early '76, after the label tested the market with the pre-album release of the title track, written by Paul Davis. It peaked at #35, and was followed by \"I Need A Harbour For My Soul,\" backed with \"I'll Comfort You,\" which entered the charts and exited just as quickly. Produced by Bob Gallo, the record followed in its predecessor's footsteps - light pop with easy production, strong harmonies, and occasional string arrangements. While record executives were pondering Middleton's future for him, they re-released \"It Wouldn't Have Made A Difference\" on several singles, usually with tracks from the second album backing it. But by late 1976, they opted not to extend the invitation for him to cut a third record. He continued on the local area circuit for a few months, but eventually packed it in. After all but disappearing from music, Middleton resurrected his old group The Marquis in 1990 for a reunion and fundraiser for a boys' soccer team, then occasionally crawled out of the basement to perform off and on for the next few years. He still occasionally makes appearances on the west coast, playing blues and jazz festivals as well as occasional club dates,http://www.canadianbands.com/Tom%20Middleton.html although he did give up the business of music and worked at Canada Post for 34 years until retiring in 2012.Posted by co-worker Norm Gamble at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZWnNN8DfNY ==Singles== *\"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\" (1973) (#10 CAN)https://musiccanada.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/1973s-biggest-canadian-hits/ ==References== Category:Living people Category:Canadian male singers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
