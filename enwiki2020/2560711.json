She was born in Valencia in 1966, of Basque parents as her name suggests, the youngest of seven children. The Basque surname Etxebarria has no diacritics, although its Spanish version Echevarr\u00eda has. Etxebarr\u00eda was a typo that she liked and adopted as a nom de plume, though it is not used in all her books. She is a recipient of the Premio Planeta de Novela and the Premio Nadal. ==Career== Her first book was Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love's biography: La historia de Kurt y Courtney: aguanta esto (1996). Her first novel, Amor, curiosidad, prozac y dudas (1997) received Ana Mar\u00eda Matute's support, and situated her in the Generacion Kronen scope. The following year her second novel, Beatriz y los cuerpos celestes, won the Nadal Prize.El Pa\u00eds, January 7, 1998 With De todo lo visible y lo invisible (2001) she won the Primavera Prize. With Un milagro en equilibrio, she obtained the 53rd Planeta Prize in 2004.El Pa\u00eds, October 16, 2004 In addition to these books and many other titles she has published poetry; her collection Actos de placer y amor won the Barcarola Poetry Prize in 2004. She has published two collections of feminist essays, and has also worked as a scriptwriter. In 2011, Etxebarria said she would stop writing, claiming that digital redistribution of her books had made writing not worth the effort because of piracy. She is a member of Mensa. ==Bibliography== The following bibliography is probably incomplete.
