    "text": "The Fishing Boat is an 1865 painting by French painter Gustave Courbet. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a beached fishing boat on the French coastline near Trouville. It is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was one of a series of 35 oil paintings that Courbet produced in quick succession during the fall of 1865. Unlike many other marine paintings of that time, the boat is the central feature of the composition rather than a minor element. The Fishing Boat was the first work by Courbet to enter the Met's collection when it was acquired in 1899. == References == Category:1865 paintings Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Paintings by Gustave Courbet Category:Water in art Category:Ships in art ",
