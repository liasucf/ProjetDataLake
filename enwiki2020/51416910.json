He has been described as one of Russia's leading theatre directors. == Life and career == Serebrennikov was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russian SFSR to a Jewish father and a Ukrainian mother. His father was a surgeon, while his mother was a teacher of Russian language and literature. Having graduated from Rostov State University with majors in physics in 1992.

Serebrennikov has staged drama productions in Moscow Chekhov Theatre, Latvian National Theatre, Theatre of Nations. He has been active in opera staging productions for the Mariinsky Theatre, and the Bolshoi Theatre in Russia, where he has also been a stage director and a designer for a ballet, Komische Oper Berlin and Stuttgart Opera in Germany.

In 2012, he was appointed artistic director of The Gogol Center. On 23 May 2017, Serebrennikov's apartment and the Gogol Center facilities were raided by law enforcement agencies in connection with an alleged embezzlement at the Seventh Studio, a non-profit organization established by Serebrennikov. While no charges against Serebrennikov have been filed, some of Russia's most prominent cultural figures saw the publicized raid of his apartment as a political gesture, discouraging Serebrennikov and others from criticizing the government. (Serebrennikov had criticised the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and has spoken out in support of Russia\u2019s LGBT community.) Vladimir Urin, and Yevgeny Mironov, among others, in May 2017 expressed their support of Serebrennikov in a letter passed on to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a public function. On 22 August 2017, Serebrennikov was detained by the Investigative Committee of Russia, suspected of masterminding a fraud scheme involving a state subsidy the Seventh Studio received from the government of Russia from 2011 to 2014. According to a source cited by Interfax, in the case of \"Gogol-center\" the alleged theft of 2014 budget funds caused damage to the state valued at several million dollars. Other sources say a total of just over one million rubles.\u0412 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u00ab\u0413\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c- \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0435\u00bb \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0438, kommersant.ru, 23 May 2017 (in Russian).\u041e\u0431\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435, interfax.ru, 23 May 2017 (in Russian).
