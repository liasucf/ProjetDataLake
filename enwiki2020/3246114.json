In October 2016, the firm was purchased by Avnet in a deal valued at approximately \u00a3691 million. ==History== The firm was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds as A.C. Farnell Limited. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966. The company was based next to Wetherby railway station, later moving into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and in 1995, into offices in Armley. In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components. As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year. In 1996 it bought the United States distributor, Premier Industrial Corporation, and changed its name to Premier Farnell. In 2001 the firm acquired Buck & Hickman, a company which it sold in 2007. In 2006, the firm sold Kent, its specialist automotive consumables business. In the mid-2000s, the firm developed from a catalogues and trade counter business into an e-commerce operation, under the direction of Harriet Green, CEO, who joined the business in 2006. In 2007 the firm launched its Greater China business, Premier Electronics, with a warehouse and distribution centre in WaiGaoQiao. Towards the end of 2008 the group began the closure of Cadillac Electric (part of the group's Industrial Products Division). During the course of 2008 the group acquired Hynetic Electronics, an Indian distributor, and in early 2009 it acquired Microdis Electronics, an electronics distributor based in Poland. On 24 September 2009, it announced the acquisition of CadSoft Computer GmbH, developer of EAGLE electronic design automation software, which it later sold in 2016. On 17 March 2016, the group sold its Akron Brass subsidiary to IDEX Corporation for $224.2 million. From time to time, Premier Farnell shares were a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. On 17 October 2016, American company Avnet completed its acquisition of Premier Farnell in a deal valued at approximately \u00a3691 million, leading to delisting of Premier Farnell shares.
