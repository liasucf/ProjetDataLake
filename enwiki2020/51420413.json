    "text": "Mads Bech S\u00f8rensen (born 7 January 1999), sometimes known as Mads Bech, is a Danish professional footballer who plays for English club Brentford as a central defender. He began his career in his native Denmark with AC Horsens and has been capped by Denmark at youth level. ==Club career== ===AC Horsens=== A defender, S\u00f8rensen began his youth career with \u00d8stbirk IF, before transferring to the academy at AC Horsens in 2011. After progressing through the youth ranks, he won his maiden call into the first team squad for a 1. division match versus HB K\u00f8ge on 3 May 2015. At age 16 years, three months and 26 days, S\u00f8rensen became Horsens' youngest-ever player when he started in the 1\u20131 draw and he remained on the pitch until being substituted for Malthe Boesen (the player who had previously held the record) after 75 minutes. He made five further appearances during the remainder of the 2014\u201315 season and signed a new two-year contract on 9 June 2015. Over the course of the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 seasons, S\u00f8rensen continued to make a handful of appearances a season, mostly as a substitute, even after Horsens' promotion to the Superliga in 2016. After signing a new three-year contract in May 2016, S\u00f8rensen made 10 appearances during the 2016\u201317 season and scored his first senior goal with a consolation in a 3\u20131 DBU Pokalen last-16 defeat to AGF Aarhus on 15 March 2017. S\u00f8rensen appeared in Horsens' opening three matches of the 2017\u201318 season and scoring the first league goal of his career in a 4\u20131 victory over Lyngby on 23 July 2017. Despite that excellent start to the season, he departed the club on 31 July, just two days after his final appearance for the club. In just over two years as a first team player at the CASA Arena, S\u00f8rensen made 25 appearances and scored two goals. While a Horsens player, he filled the roles of left back, central defender and left midfield. === Brentford === On 31 July 2017, S\u00f8rensen moved to England to join the B team at Championship club Brentford on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Injuries to first team central defenders John Egan, Andreas Bjelland and Chris Mepham saw S\u00f8rensen feature as an unused substitute on five occasions during the 2017\u201318 season and he was promoted into the first team squad for the 2018\u201319 season. He made his debut for the club with a start in an EFL Cup first round match versus Southend United on 14 August 2018, but was substituted with a dead leg after half an hour of the 4\u20132 victory. After returning to fitness, a knee injury suffered in October kept him out of action for months. A season-ending injury suffered by central defender Yoann Barbet in late March 2019 allowed S\u00f8rensen to break into the starting lineup and he finished the 2018\u201319 season with 10 appearances. A knee injury suffered prior to Brentford's first friendly of the 2019\u201320 pre-season kept S\u00f8rensen out until late September 2019. He resumed his involvement with the first team squad in November 2019 and made two appearances before signing a new -year contract in January 2020. Down the pecking order, S\u00f8rensen departed on loan for the remainder of the season on 9 January 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic led to his early return from the loan, but he was ineligible for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season. ==== AFC Wimbledon (loan) ==== On 9 January 2020, S\u00f8rensen joined League One club AFC Wimbledon on loan until the end of the 2019\u201320 season. Prior to the season being ended early, he made 9 appearances and helped the Dons to avoid relegation to League Two. == International career == S\u00f8rensen won his maiden call into the Denmark U18 squad in September 2016 and made 7 appearances during the 2016\u201317 season, captaining the team and scoring once in a 4\u20132 friendly victory over Belarus U18 on 18 October. He was promoted into the U19 squad in January 2017 and made two appearances during the remainder of the 2016\u201317 season. In mid-August 2017, S\u00f8rensen was named as captain of the Denmark U19 squad for the 2017 Four Nations Tournament, in which he made two appearances. He made his U21 debut with two 2021 European U21 Championship qualification appearances in October 2019. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |National Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Other ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"5\" |AC Horsens |2014\u201315 | rowspan=\"2\" |1. division |6 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |6 |0 |- |2015\u201316 |5 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |6 |0 |- |2016\u201317 | rowspan=\"2\" |Danish Superliga |6 |0 |3 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |1Appearance in Danish Superliga relegation play-offs |0 |10 |1 |- |2017\u201318 |3 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |3 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !20 !1 !4 !1 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !1 !0 !25 !2 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Brentford |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"4\" |Championship |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |0 |0 |- |2018\u201319 |8 |0 |1 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |10 |0 |- |2019\u201320 |1 |0 |1 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |2 |0 |- |2020\u201321 |0 |0 |0 |0 |3 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |3 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !9 !0 !2 !0 !4 !0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !15 !0 |- |AFC Wimbledon (loan) |2019\u201320 |League One |9 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |9 |0 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !38 !1 !6 !1 !4 !0 !1 !0 !49 !2 |} ==References== ==External links== * *Mads Bech S\u00f8rensen at dbu.dk * Mads Bech S\u00f8rensen at brentfordfc.com * Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Danish 1st Division players Category:AC Horsens players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Denmark youth international footballers Category:Danish expatriate footballers Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in the United Kingdom Category:Association football central defenders Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Horsens Category:English Football League players Category:Denmark under-21 international footballers Category:AFC Wimbledon players ",
