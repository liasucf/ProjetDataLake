Okene was launched on 23 August 1974 and Okapi on 13 February 1975. While still under construction, the two ships were acquired by the West German Navy in 1976 for conversion to naval replenishment tankers. Okene was converted by Kr\u00f6ger and was renamed Rh\u00f6n for a mountain range in Germany. Okapi was taken to Bremerhaven for conversion and renamed Spessart, also a mountain range in Germany. Both ships entered service in 1977. On 1 April 2009, pirates operating off the Somalian coast mistook Spessart as a commercial tanker and opened fire on it before attempting to board the ship. The attack was repelled and the pirates were chased by several naval ships, eventually being captured by a Greek frigate. The pirates were handed over to the to be prosecuted. In July 2018, it was announced that both vessels of the class were laid up due to heavy maintenance required to get them back into service and that Spessarts engine would require a complete overhaul. ==Citations== ==References== * * ==External links== Category:Auxiliary replenishment ship classes Category:Oil tankers Category:Tankers of Germany Category:Auxiliary ships of the German Navy ",
