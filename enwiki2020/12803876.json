    "text": "Cartier Field was a stadium in Notre Dame, Indiana, first dedicated on May 11, 1900 as an arena for football, baseball, track and field, and bicycling. It hosted the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1900 to 1928, and held nearly 30,000 people at its peak. The stands were torn down after the 1928 season to make room for Notre Dame Stadium, which opened in 1930. Notre Dame played its entire 1929 schedule away from campus (\"home\" games were at Chicago's Soldier Field), went undefeated (9\u20130) and won the National Championship. At Coach Knute Rockne's insistence, Cartier Field's grass was transplanted into Notre Dame Stadium. An early sketch of Cartier Field, as seen in the October 14, 1899 edition of the Notre Dame Scholastic. For more than 30 years after the football team moved out, Cartier Field remained the home of Notre Dame's baseball and track and field teams. In 1962, the original Cartier Field was replaced by a quadrangle adjoining the Memorial Library, which opened in 1963, and a new facility named Cartier Field was opened east of Notre Dame Stadium. Since 2008, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team has held outdoor practices at the LaBar Football Practice Fields, and indoor practices at Meyo Field in the Loftus Center. It was named after Warren Antoine Cartier, an 1887 civil engineering graduate and former member of the football team who purchased 10 acres (40,000 m2) and donated it to the University for establishment of the Field. He also paid for furnishing the lumber required to enclose the Field with fencing and furnished the lumber required for a grandstand.http://magazine.nd.edu/news/47333-echoes-cartier- athletic-field/ The Fighting Irish would officially amass a 116\u20132\u20136 record at Cartier Field (with an additional three to five wins and one loss coming in the 1899 season before the stadium was completed, and an unrecognized win against Cincinnati in 1900) with their two losses coming against Wabash in 1905, and Carnegie Tech in 1928, which happened to be the last match football game played on the field. During this 29 year stretch, the Irish also recorded some of the longest home winning streaks in the history of college football, with 40 straight wins from 1907 to 1918, and 38 straight wins from 1919 to 1927 (if not for a tie against Great Lakes Navy in 1918, the streak would have been 78 straight contests). In terms of unbeaten streaks, the Irish went undefeated at home for 23 years, and 93 contests, from 1905 to 1928. ==References== ==External links== * History of Cartier Field Category:Defunct college football venues Category:American football venues in Indiana Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football venues Category:University of Notre Dame buildings and structures ",
