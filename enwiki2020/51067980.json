    "text": "Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World is the third mixtape by American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. It was released on April 15, 2016, by Generation Now and Atlantic Records, serving as his second commercial release with Atlantic.The mixtape features production from Cubeatz, Don Cannon, Lyle LeDuff, Maaly Raw, Metro Boomin and WondaGurl. A sequel was released on March 13, 2020. ==Singles== The lead single from the mixtape, called \"Money Longer\" was released on February 6, 2016. The track was produced by Don Cannon and Maaly Raw. The other two singles from the mixtape, \"You Was Right\" and \"Ps & Qs\" were released on April 15, 2016 with the rest of the mixtape. The first track was produced by Metro Boomin, and second by Don Cannon. ==Cover art== The artwork was designed by 20-year-old St. Louis artist Fvrris, sourcing the art of Bryan Lee O\u2019Malley, whose Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is referenced in the album\u2019s title. The cover art transforms Lil Uzi Vert into a cartoon character that depicts Scott Pilgrim. He is featured with his own love interest, that shares likeliness to Brittany Byrd but that also depicts Ramona Flowers, on top of his head. The background is filled with a mob of people, who appear to be enviously gazing at Uzi, these are to emulate his \"haters\". Uzi, however seems to only be bothered about the girl on his head. One of the people is spinning a basketball on his finger this is an allusion to Brittany who used to play basketball before meeting Uzi (Nardwuar revealed this in his interview with Lil Uzi). Two cameras flash directly at Uzi, this is to portray the newfound fame Uzi has accumulated, and in front of the two girls kissing there is a bass guitar that has \"Rage\" engraved on its side. When paired with the two girls kissing it alludes to Uzi's previous project Luv Is Rage. Lastly there's use of a colourful psychedelic background which highlights the cloud rap genre Uzi uses in the mixtape. ==Commercial performance== Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World peaked at number 37 on the US Billboard 200 and spent a total of 55 weeks on the chart. It also peaked at number 18 on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The mixtape was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 1,000,000 units in the United States. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:right\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 168 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 67 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 53 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2016 mixtape albums Category:Albums produced by Don Cannon Category:Albums produced by WondaGurl Category:Albums produced by Metro Boomin Category:Albums produced by Cubeatz Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Lil Uzi Vert albums ",
