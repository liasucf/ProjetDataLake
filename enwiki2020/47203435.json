    "text": "Th\u00e9ophile Lepage (24 March 1901 \u2013 1 April 1991) was a Belgian mathematician. ==Biography== Th\u00e9ophile Henri Joseph Lepage, better known as Th\u00e9ophile Lepage, was born in Limburg on March 24, 1901. Together with Alfred Errera he founded the seminar for mathematical analysis at the ULB. This seminar played an important role in the flourishing of the department of mathematics at this university. He was professor of mathematics at the University of Li\u00e8ge from 1928 till 1930. He taught differential and integral calculus at the ULB from 1931 till 1956 and higher analysis from 1956 till 1971. For 43 years he was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. On June 5, 1948, he was nominated a corresponding member and on June 9, 1956 an effective member of the Acad\u00e9mie. In 1963 he became president of the Acad\u00e9mie and director of the Klasse Wetenschappen. He was also active in the Belgisch Wiskundig Genootschap. He died in Verviers on April 1, 1991. ==His mathematical work== At the ULB, the ideas and the enthusiasm of Th\u00e9ophile de Donder formed the foundation of a flourishing mathematical tradition. Thanks to student Th\u00e9ophile Lepage, external differential calculus acquired one of the most helpful methods introduced in mathematics during the 20th century, and one for which De Donder was a pioneer, presenting new applications in the resolution of a classical problem--the partial differential equation of Monge-Amp\u00e8re--and in the synthesis of the methods of Th\u00e9ophile de Donder, Hermann Weyl and Constantin Carath\u00e9odory into a calculus of variations of multipal integrals. Thanks to the use of differential geometry, it is possible to avoid long and boring calculations. The results of Lepage were named in reference works. His methods are still inspiring contemporary mathematicians: Boener and Sniatycki talked about the congruence of Lepage; not so long ago, Demeter Krupka, introduced--beside the eulerian forms which correspond to the classical equations of the calculus of variations of Euler--the so-called lepagian forms or equivalents of Lepage in equations of variations on fiber spaces. We also have Lepage to thank for interesting results concerning linear representations of the symplectic group, and more specifically Lepage's dissolution of an outer potency of the product of an even number of duplicates of a complex surface. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1901 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Belgian mathematicians Category:Differential geometers Category:People from Limbourg Category:Free University of Brussels faculty Category:University of Li\u00e8ge faculty Category:Members of the Royal Academy of Belgium ",
