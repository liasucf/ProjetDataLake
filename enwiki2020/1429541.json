    "text": "Steven James Grogan (born July 24, 1953) is a former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for sixteen seasons with the New England Patriots. He played college football at Kansas State University and was selected by the Patriots in the fifth round of the 1975 NFL Draft. An agile, durable dual-threat quarterback in an era known for pocket passers, he led the league in both passing and quarterback rushing statistics several times in his career, and ran for a quarterback-record 12 touchdowns in 1976, a record that stood for 35 seasons. Grogan ran for over 500 yards in 1978 and led the team to an NFL record 3,156 rushing yards, eclipsed by the 2019 Baltimore Ravens. When he retired in 1990, he held many of the team's passing and longevity records. He was inducted into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame in 1995, and currently owns a sporting goods store in Massachusetts. ==High school and college== Grogan had a standout prep career in Kansas at Ottawa High School,Database of Football, Steve Grogan where he led his team to state titles in track in 1970,Boys State Indoor Track & Field Meets, KSHSAA http://www.kshsaa.org/Public/Track/PDF/CompleteHistory.pdf basketball in 1971,History of Boys State Basketball Winners, KSHSAA http://www.kshsaa.org/Public/Basketball/PDF/CompleteHistory.pdf and a 3A state runner-up finish in football in 1970.State Champs, Kansas HS Football History http://www.kansasfootballhistory.com/statechamps.cfm Grogan spent his collegiate career at Kansas State University, where he started as a quarterback for his junior and senior years.Steve Grogan, Official New England Patriots Biography He threw for 2,214 yards, completing 166 of 371 pass attempts, with 12 TDs and 26 interceptions. He ran for 585 yards and six touchdowns on 339 attempts, punted 7 times for 279 yards (a 39.9-yard average), and as a senior caught one touchdown pass of 22 yards. Against Memphis in 1973, he had a 100-yard rushing game.K-State Football Records ==New England Patriots== Grogan was selected in the fifth round (116th overall) in the 1975 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. Although he would start every game for four consecutive seasons early in his career, his career was also marked by injuries and quarterback controversies, with Grogan competing with other quarterbacks for the starting job. His second through his fifth season were the only times he would start every game in a season. Besides taking the starting job from former Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett as a rookie,Gill, J. (August 18, 2010). Boston sports, then and now: Steve Grogan. Boston Sports, Then and Now. Grogan would later face competition from Matt Cavanaugh, Tony Eason, Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie, and Marc Wilson. (By the time Wilson came to the Patriots, he had spent several years battling the displaced Plunkett for the starting job of the Raiders.) In his first season, Grogan played in 13 games out of the then-14 game regular season, starting 7 of the last 8. Grogan threw for 1,976 yards, 11 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.Steve Grogan, QB at NFL.com The Patriots finished with a 3-11 record, and traded Plunkett, their starter for the previous four years, in the off-season. (Plunkett would eventually lead the Raiders to two Super Bowl victories.) For the Patriots 1976 season, Grogan led the Patriots to an 11-3 record and the franchise's first playoff berth since 1963. The eleven wins were the most Patriots wins in a season since the club\u2019s inception. Along the way the Patriots defeated the defending Super Bowl champion, Pittsburgh Steelers (30-27). They also handed the Oakland Raiders their only regular season loss that year by defeating them 48-17. However, they lost the divisional playoffs (24-21) to the Raiders. Grogan scored 12 rushing touchdowns in 1976, breaking a quarterback record of 11 previously held by Tobin Rote and Johnny Lujack.1976 NFL Rushing Statistics - The Football DatabaseHarrison, E. (October 8, 2010). From Moss to Johnny U, these are the most impressive records. NFL.com. His record would stand for 35 years until broken by Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton's 14 in 2011. In the Patriots 1978 season, Grogan led the Patriots to an 11-5 record, a division title and the organization's first ever home playoff game, a 31\u201314 loss to the Houston Oilers. The Patriots set the all-time single season team rushing record with 3,156 yards (Grogan rushing for 539 yards and 5 touchdowns himself), a record that stood until broken by the 2019 Baltimore Ravens. It is also the only season an NFL team has had 4 players rush for over 500 yards apiece. In the early 1980s, Grogan suffered several injuries, and the Patriots drafted quarterback Tony Eason in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft. By the Patriots 1985 season, Eason had taken the starting quarterback position and led the Patriots to a 2\u20133 record initially. Coach Raymond Berry benched Eason for Grogan. The Patriots won 6 straight games behind their old quarterback, only to lose Grogan when he suffered a broken leg in Week 12 against the New York Jets.Zimmerman, P. (February 3, 1986). A brilliant case for the defense. Sports Illustrated. Filling in again at QB, Eason and the Patriots lost that Jets game 16-13 in overtime, and relinquished 1st place in the AFC East Division. With Eason's return, the Patriots went 3-2 in their remaining five games. Finishing the season with an 11-5 record, the Patriots earned a wild card berth into the playoffs and eventually reached Super Bowl XX, where they faced the Chicago Bears, who, with their defensive coach Buddy Ryan's \"46\" defense, had gone 15\u20131 during the regular season. Eason, who had led the Patriots to victory in the wild card, divisional, and conference playoff games, started the game, but the Patriots could do little against the Bears' defense and Eason went 0-6 in passing attempts; Coach Berry replaced him with Grogan. Grogan went on to connect on 17 of 30 passes for 177 yards, a touchdown, but also two interceptions, in the 46-10 loss. Of little solace was the fact that the Patriots were the only team to score against the Bears in the playoffs that season. At the time of his retirement, Grogan led the franchise as the all-time leader in passing yards (26,886) and passing touchdowns (182).New England Patriots, All Time Leaders, Passing As of 2019, he is ranked third in passing yards behind Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe and second in passing touchdowns behind Brady. His 16 seasons are the second most ever for a Patriots player, behind Tom Brady.\"Tom Brady is Scorching the NFL and Setting Records Just Two Games Into the Season\" He also held the Patriots previous single-game record with a 153.9 quarterback rating, achieved by completing 13-of-18 passes for 315 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions against the New York Jets on September 9, 1979, before Drew Bledsoe posted a perfect 158.3 rating against the Indianapolis Colts on December 26, 1993.\"Drew Bledsoe: Game Logs\", NFL.com Statistically, Grogan's best season was the Patriots 1979 season, when he completed 206 of 423 passes for 3,286 yards and 28 touchdowns, rushing for 368 yards and 2 touchdowns.Steve Grogan: Career Stats at NFL.com His 28 touchdown passes led the league, tied with Brian Sipe of Cleveland,2010 NFL Record and Stat Book, Yearly Stat Leaders and his rushing yards led the league for quarterbacks. Grogan rushed for 2,176 yards (4.9 per carry) and 35 touchdowns during his career,New England Patriots, All Time Leaders, Rushing a mark which places him as the Patriots' fourth overall in rushing touchdowns. With Grogan, the Patriots made the playoffs five times (1976, 1978, 1982, 1985, and 1986 as a backup). Before Grogan was drafted, the Patriots made the playoffs just once from 1960-1974. Grogan's injuries and his toughness in response to them are also part of his legacy. One sports writer for the Boston Globe, wrote of the \"Grogan Toughness Meter\" in 2003. The writer, Nick Cafardo, gave a partial listing of Grogan's injuries over his 16-year career: \"Five knee surgeries; screws in his leg after the tip of his fibula snapped; a cracked fibula that snapped when he tried to practice; two ruptured disks in his neck, which he played with for 1 1/2 seasons; a broken left hand (he simply handed off with his right hand); two separated shoulders on each side; the reattachment of a tendon to his throwing elbow; and three concussions.\"Cafardo, N. (September 25, 2003). Brady inspires tough love. Boston Globe. == After football == After retiring from the Patriots, Grogan attempted to get a coaching job, but found that no one above the high school level would hire him. He was approached by the then-owner of Marciano Sporting Goods in Mansfield, Massachusetts (a business originally started by Rocky Marciano's brother Peter) to purchase the struggling business from him. Living only five miles from the store, and seeing it as a good investment, Grogan agreed to purchase the store, renamed it Grogan Marciano Sporting Goods, and continues to run the business today. Other than running his business, he also makes appearances at local businesses and civic organizations. ==Honors== Grogan's high school, Ottawa High School in Ottawa, Kansas has named its football stadium after him,Ottawa Senior High School student handbook and he was also inducted into the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. Kansas State has retired the number Grogan wore for the Wildcats, #11, to jointly honor him and Lynn Dickey, who also wore #11.Haskin, K. (August 7, 2002).
