    "text": "In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry, the v-topology (also known as the universally subtrusive topology) is a Grothendieck topology whose covers are characterized by lifting maps from valuation rings. This topology was introduced by and studied further by , who introduced the name v-topology, where v stands for valuation. ==Definition== A universally subtrusive map is a map f: X -> Y of quasi-compact, quasi-separated schemes such that for any map v: Spec (V) -> Y, where V is a valuation ring, there is an extension (of valuation rings) V \\subset W and a map Spec W -> X lifting v. ==Examples== Examples of v-covers include faithfully flat maps, proper surjective maps. introduced the h-topology. It is based on submersive maps, i.e., maps whose underlying map of topological spaces is a quotient map (i.e., surjective and a subset of Y is open if and only if its preimage in X is open). Any such submersive map is a v-cover. The converse holds if Y is Noetherian, but not in general. ==Arc topology== have introduced the arc-topology, which is similar in its definition, except that only valuation rings of rank \u2264 1 are considered in the definition. show that the Amitsur complex of an arc covering of perfect rings is an exact complex. ==See also== * List of topologies on the category of schemes ==References== * * * * * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
