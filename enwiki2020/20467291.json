    "text": "Molybdenum deficiency refers to the clinical consequences of inadequate supplies of molybdenum in the diet. The amount of molybdenum required is relatively small, and molybdenum deficiency usually does not occur in natural settings. However, it can occur in individuals receiving parenteral nutrition. ==Signs and symptoms== Descriptions of human molybdenum deficiency are few. A patient receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition acquired a syndrome described as \u2018acquired molybdenum deficiency.\u2019 This syndrome, exacerbated by methionine administration, was characterized by high blood methionine, low blood uric acid, and low urinary uric acid and sulfate concentrations. The patient suffered mental disturbances that progressed to a coma. Pathological changes occurring in individuals with a genetic disease that results in a sulfite oxidase (a molybdoenzyme) deficiency include increased plasma and urine sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate, S-sulfocysteine and taurine; seizures, and brain atrophy/lesions; dislocated lenses; and death at an early age.. ==Diagnosis== ==Treatment== 300 mcg Ammonium Molybdate per day can cause recovery of \u201cacquired molybdenum deficiency\u201d [3] == See also == * Molybdenum cofactor deficiency == References == == Further reading == * == External links == Category:Mineral deficiencies ",
