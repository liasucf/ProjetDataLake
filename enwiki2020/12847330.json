The Ogaden region is populated mostly by ethnic Somalis and has been devastated by drought, famine and an armed separatist movement. Temperatures in Danan soar daily to well over 110 degrees creating some of the most unbearable living conditions in all of Africa. The Denan Project, the only humanitarian organization in the town, was founded to provide qualified medical care to the people of Danan. Its hospital is the only free acute medical care in the Ogaden region which is populated by 5 million people. The Ethiopian Roads Authority announced in November 2007 a construction project to connect Danan with Kebri Dahar with 95 kilometers of paved road and construction of six large and medium bridges.\"ERA building asphalt roads with 600mln birr in Somali State\" (Walta Information Center, accessed 13 December 2007) == History == Danan fell to the Italians in January, 1936 as part of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), p. 127 As part of the reprisals for the attempted assassination of General Rodolfo Graziani (19 February 1937), it was used as a prison camp for hundreds of people arrested as part of the reprisals.Mockler, Haile Selassie's War, p. 177 While Ethiopian sources state of 6500 internees held there 3175 died, contemporary Italian reports claim that much fewer were ill and only a handful died. Alberto Sbacchi concludes from these conflicting reports that while \"the occurrence of illness and death is difficult to determine, but we can assume that many suffered and died. Graziani's order to supply them with only enough food to live strongly suggests it, as do the conditions under which the Ethiopians were confined. Poor facilities, including latrines, the humid climate, malaria, stomach infections, and venereal disease took many lives, especially among those compelled to work on the irrigation canal or on the banana and sugar-cane plantation.\"Sbacchi, \"Italy and the Treatment of the Ethiopian Aristocracy, 1937-1940\", International Journal of African Historical Studies, 10 (1977), p. 217 In January 2009, the foreign relations chief of the Ogaden National Liberation Front, Mohammed Sirad, was killed by the Ethiopian Army at Danan where he was meeting with other ONLF members.\"Senior ONLF leader Killed\" (accessed 27 January 2009) == Demographics == Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Danan has an estimated total population of 10,494, of whom 5,918 are men and 4,576 are women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.4 The 1997 census reported this town had a total population of 7,030 of whom 3,910 were men and 3,120 women.
