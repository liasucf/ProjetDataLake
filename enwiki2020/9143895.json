    "text": "Energy Rekords is a record label formed in 1990 by the merging of the three labels: Front Music Production, Electronic Beat Association, and Energy - all small labels run from the Swedish town of \u00c4lmhult. By banding together these labels' founders H\u00e5kan Ehrnst, Krister Svensson and Per Faeltenborg formed a foundation for the Swedish electronic music in the 1990s by signing up new emerging artists like S.P.O.C.K and Daily Planet as well as veterans such as Page, Blue For Two and Oil In The Eye from the UK. During the first half of the 1990s the label was considered to be the leading Swedish alternative electronic music label and hosted the annual Virtual X-mas party at Mejeriet in Lund, Sweden for many years. In 1995 Energy Rekords opened up two sub labels targeted towards different markets; the \"Beat That!\" label for indie pop/rock and the Cascade label for techno/dance style music. In 1998 Energy Rekords merged with October Records and added that label's bands to its roster. ==Roster== *Brave New World *Children Within *Das Ich *Diskodiktator *Elegant Machinery *EnCounter *Forbidden Colours *Front 242 *Frontline Assembly *In Strict Confidence *Iris *Kiethevez *LCD *Oil In The Eye *Peter Bjorn and John *Poupp\u00e9e Fabrikk *Project-X *Proxy *Rational Youth *Robert Marlow *Sista Mannen P\u00e5 Jorden *Slagsm\u00e5lsklubben *Souls at Zero *The Nine *VNV Nation *Welle: Erdball ==See also== * List of record labels * Deep Shag Records ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Releases on Discogs.com Category:Swedish record labels Category:Record labels established in 2005 Category:Electronic music record labels Category:Industrial record labels Category:Synth-pop record labels Category:Alternative rock record labels ",
