    "text": "The Spingarn Medal is awarded annually by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for outstanding achievement by an African American. The award was created in 1914 by Joel Elias Spingarn, chairman of the board of directors of the NAACP. It was first awarded to biologist Ernest E. Just in 1915, and has been given most years thereafter. At its annual convention, the NAACP presents the award after deciding from open nominations. Should the organization end, it would be managed by Howard or Fisk Universities. The gold medal is valued at $100, and Spingarn left $20,000 () in his will for the NAACP to continue giving it indefinitely. ==List of recipients== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=col | Year ! scope=col class=unsortable | Picture ! scope=col | Name ! scope=col class=unsortable | Rationale |- | align=center | 1915 | Ernest Everett Just ! scope=row | | \"Head of Physiology, Howard University Medical School for research in biology.\" |- | align=center | 1916 | Charles Young ! scope=row | | \"Services in organizing the Liberian Constabulary and roads in the Republic of Liberia.\" |- |-! scope=row | align=center | 1917 | Harry Burleigh ! scope=row | |\"Excellence in the field of creative music.\" |- | align=center | 1918 | William Braithwaite ! scope=row | | \"Distinguished achievements in literature.\" |- | align=center | 1919 | Archibald Grimk\u00e9 ! scope=row | | \"U.S. Consul in Santo Domingo; President of American Negro Academy; for seventy years of distinguished service to his race and country.\" |- | align=center | 1920 | W.
