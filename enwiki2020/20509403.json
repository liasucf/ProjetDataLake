He played second on Chris Plys' team that won the 2008 World Junior Curling Championship. == Curling career == Perushek started curling in 1995. With teammates Chris Plys and Aanders Brorson, he won the Minnesota Junior State Championship in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each of those years his team continued on to win the United States Junior Championship. He won the \"All-Star Second\" award at the 2008 and 2009 U.S. Junior National Championships. Winning the United States Junior Championships earned Perushek the chance to compete in three World Junior Championships. In 2007, in Eveleth, Minnesota, his home town and home club, they finished in fifth place when they lost a tiebreaker to Denmark's Rasmus Stjerne. The following year, now with Matt Hamilton at lead, World's was in \u00d6stersund, Sweden and after finishing the round-robin with a 7\u20132 record they defeated the number one seed Canada in the semifinals and the number two seed Sweden, skipped by Oskar Eriksson, in the final to win the gold medal.
