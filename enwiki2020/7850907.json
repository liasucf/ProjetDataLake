    "text": "The 2007 Baltimore mayoral election was held on November 6, 2007. Because Baltimore's electorate is overwhelmingly Democratic, Sheila Dixon's victory in the Democratic primary on September 11 all but assured her of victory in the general election,http://www.wmdt.com/wires/displaystory.asp?id=65600131 and she defeated Republican candidate Elbert Henderson in the general election by an overwhelming majority. Dixon, who as president of the Baltimore City Council became mayor in January 2007 when Martin O'Malley resigned to become Governor of Maryland, was the first woman to be elected to the office. == Background and candidates == Martin O'Malley, the winner of the previous mayoral election, was elected governor of Maryland in 2006. Therefore, city council president Sheila Dixon became mayor for the final year of what had been O'Malley's term, and subsequently ran for reelection to a full term. Other candidates for the Democratic nomination included city councilman Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr.; Andrey Bundley, a former school administrator who was O'Malley's only major opponent for the Democratic nomination in 2003; Frank M. Conaway, Sr., the only person, other than Dixon, in the race to have won a citywide election, who withdrew before the primary, Maryland state delegate Jill P. Carter;http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=8ff3cfdd- ef68-4971-9787-d6062bda00b9 and perennial Baltimore-area candidate and social activist A. Robert Kaufman. Elbert Henderson was the sole candidate for the Republican nomination; he was the Republican nominee in the previous election, losing by a wide margin to O'Malley. Kweisi Mfume, former Congressman and president of the NAACP, was at one point rumored to be considering a run, but ultimately chose not to join the race. The Green Party did not nominate a mayoral candidate. Dixon had the advantage of incumbency, but Mitchell, who was seen as the mayor's most prominent opponent, hoped to overcome that advantage with a grassroots campaign. The beginning of Dixon's term and campaign was dogged by an ethics investigation, although the city's Board of Ethics ultimately found no reason to prosecute her. An upsurge of violent crime in Baltimore during the first half of 2007 affected early campaigning. Dixon launched a number of anti-crime initiatives, focusing on illegal guns. Mitchell's initial campaign moves focused on crime; Carter, criticizing Dixon's administration for what she called overzealous policing, promised a total revamp of the police department, stating that \"if we had leadership in this city, we would have already changed police commissioners.\" The Baltimore police commissioner later resigned his post on July 19, in an act that some observers felt would affect the course of the race. == July 2007 == With less than two months remaining before the Democratic primary, Carter officially announced her candidacy, and poll of likely Democratic voters commissioned by the Baltimore Sun showed Mayor Dixon holding a comfortable lead over her nearest challenger. The poll, released on July 16, 2007, had Dixon leading Councilman Mitchell with 47 percent of the likely primary voters to Mitchell's 15 percent. The rest of the field was in single digits, below the poll's margin of error, with 28 percent undecided. Although candidates would not be required to release fundraising numbers until August, Dixon was reported to have sizeable lead in this area as well. == August 2007 == With little more than a month left until the primary election, Dixon further distanced herself from her primary opponents. On August 3, 2007, Mitchell's father resigned as treasurer of his son's mayoral campaign after it was discovered that he spent more than $40,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses. Despite this incident, Mitchell said that his campaign remained focused on the problems facing Baltimore City. Meanwhile, Carter focused her campaign on the impending 50% BGE rate hike calling for re-regulation, reforming public education, and effective policing, and restoring integrity to City Hall while continuing her attack on Dixon by charging her with not showing at local political forums and for sending city employees in her stead. At a press conference outside City Hall, Carter and a campaign worker dressed in a yellow chicken suit handed out copies of a letter she sent to the State Ethics commission complaining about the practice. === Televised debate === On Monday night, August 27, 2007, all eight democratic candidates for Mayor appeared in a debate televised by Maryland Public Television and WBAL-TV. During his introduction, candidate Conaway announced that he was withdrawing from the race and throwing \"his money and support\" behind candidate Mitchell. The debate lasted fifty-five minutes with each candidate giving an opening and closing statement and answering questions posed by reporters in between. The debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters and the Greater Baltimore Committee. === Fundraising === Baltimore's WJZ-TV reported that the Dixon campaign said that as of August 30, it had more than $480,000 left to spend in the final two weeks before the September 11th Democratic primary. Carter's campaign reported having just over $8,000 on hand, and Bundley's campaign reported having $15,000 left as of the mid August 2007 campaign reporting date. Mitchell had just over $115,000 in cash on hand as of August 26. == September 2007 == Just over a week before election day, a September 2 Baltimore Sun poll had Dixon maintaining her strong lead. According to the Sun, \"Dixon leads City Councilman Keiffer J. Mitchell Jr. by 46 percent to 19 percent \u2013 a 27 percentage-point spread \u2013 according to the poll conducted by OpinionWorks, an independent Annapolis-based firm.\" According to a number of experts, the race never really became competitive. Lenneal J. Henderson, a professor at the University of Baltimore's School of Public Affairs, said, \"I think it is over. It would take a huge misstep on the part of Sheila Dixon for her not to win this one.\" Bundley (4%) and Carter (2%) showed no improvement over the previously released July poll. == Primary election: Dixon victory == On the night of the primary, less than three hours after the polls closed, Mitchell conceded defeat and Dixon claimed victory in the primary election. === Primary election results === These are the final, official results for the Democratic primary, as reported on the city of Baltimore's election board Web site. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em; font-size: 100%\" ! Candidate !! Votes !! % |- | Sheila Dixon ||54,381|| 63.1% |- | Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr.||20,376||23.7% |- | Andrey Bundley ||6,543||7.6% |- | Jill P. Carter ||2,372||2.8% |- | A. Robert Kaufman ||885||1.0% |- | Mike Schaefer ||762||0.9% |- | Frank Conaway ||533||0.6% |- | Phillip Brown ||273|| 0.3% |} Elbert Henderson ran unopposed in the Republican primary. == General election campaign == Because of the city's overwhelmingly Democratic tilt, campaigning largely ceased after the primary, with Dixon and other citywide candidates maintaining \"bare-bones\" campaign staffs. On a low-turnout general election day, Dixon defeated her Republican challenger with more than 86 percent of the vote. === General election results === These are the official results for the general election, as reported on the city of Baltimore's election board Web site. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em; font-size: 100%\" !

Votes !! % |- | Sheila Dixon ||36,726|| 86.28% |- | Elbert Henderson||5,139||12.07% |} == Other city elections == All other Baltimore city officers were also up for election simultaneously with the mayor, including the fourteen members of the Baltimore City Council (elected from single-member districts) and the City Council President and City Comptroller (both elected citywide). Incumbent comptroller Joan Pratt ran unopposed in both the Democratic primary and the general election, and none of the twelve council members seeking re-election faced serious competition in either election; one ran unopposed in the primary and seven ran unopposed in the general election. All fourteen council members returned in the general election were Democrats, as has been the case in every election since 1939. The race for the Democratic nomination for City Council President was perhaps the closest of the election cycle. The two major candidates were incumbent Stephanie Rawlings Blake, a former council member who had been appointed to fill the position with Dixon became mayor, and Michael Sarbanes, a community activist and the son of former United States Senator Paul Sarbanes and brother of U.S. Congressman John Sarbanes. A July poll had the two virtually tied, with 27 percent of respondents favoring Sarbanes and 26 percent favoring Rawlings Blake, with Councilman Kenneth N. Harris, Sr. a distant third at 8 percent. Rawlings Blake subsequently overtook Sarbanes, however, and won the primary election with 49 percent of the vote to Sarbanes' 38 percent. In the general election, the incumbent handily defeated her only opponent, Green candidate Maria Allwine, garnering 82 percent of the vote. == Mayoral endorsements == A number of city groups offered endorsements of the various candidates over the course of the campaign: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |- | Democratic Party |- |- | Republican Party |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em; font-size: 75%\" !
