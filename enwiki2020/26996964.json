He worked for the establishment of a geophysical institute in Troms\u00f8, and served as the institute's manager from 1918 to 1922. He was instrumental in many geophysical accomplishments in northern Norway in the early 20th century. ==Early life and career== Krogness was born in Trondhjem as a son of curate Ole Andreas Tangen Krogness (1832\u20131887) and Christiane Augusta Lindeman (1850\u20131928). On the paternal side he was a grandson of businessperson and politician Ole Andreas Krogness,Personalhistorie for Trondhjems by og omegn i et tidsrum af circa 1 1/2 aarhundrede, by Chr. Thaulow. Hosted by Trondheim public library. and on the maternal side he was a great-grandson of Ole Andreas Lindeman and a nephew of Anna Lindeman and Hans Thorvald Lindeman. He took the examen artium in 1904, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.real. degree in 1912. From 1908 he worked as an assistant of Kristian Birkeland. In June 1912 in Kristiania he married Dagny Vegerd Guldberg (1887\u20131978), and became a son-in-law of physician Carl Johan Guldberg. His daughter Synn\u00f8ve, born 1915, married economist Leif Holb\u00e6k-Hanssen. ==Later career== In 1912 Krogness was hired as manager of the aurora borealis observatory at Haldde in K\u00e5fjord, Alta. He also lived there with his family, and from 1915 he had company by fellow researcher Olaf Devik. The two successfully suggested the establishment of a geophysical institute in Troms\u00f8; both moved there to work in 1918. Krogness was the institute's manager from 1918 to 1922. Their work culminated in the establishment of \"V\u00e6rvarslinga for Nord-Norge\", the weather forecast of Northern Norway, in 1922. Krogness also founded the magnetical observatory at Domb\u00e5s in 1916, and in Troms\u00f8 Museum he was a board member from 1919 to 1923 and chairman from 1923 to 1928. He co-founded the nationwide Norsk Geofysisk Forening and chaired it from 1927 to 1928, and also founded the local branch of the Norwegian Polytechnic Society in Troms\u00f8. He also co- founded the Komiteen for de Vitenskapelige Institusjoner i Troms\u00f8, which proposed the establishment of a university in Northern Norway (the University of Troms\u00f8 opened in 1972). From 1928 he was a professor in terrestrial magnetism and physical cosmology at Bergen Museum. He died in May 1934 in Fana. He was decorated with the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and the Order of the Crown of Italy. In 1937 a stone monument to him was unveiled at Nesttun Church, and a road in Troms\u00f8 has been named after him. ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Trondheim Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Norwegian physicists Category:Norwegian geophysicists Category:Norwegian meteorologists Category:Cosmologists Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
