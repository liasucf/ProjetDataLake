She attended Northwestern University and at the end of her freshman year in 1923, she married American historian Bernard DeVoto, who had been her English instructor. The DeVotos remained in Evanston for four years and then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Bernard taught English at Harvard University until 1936. During these early years, DeVoto became acquainted with many literary icons - close friends of Bernard's - including Robert Frost and publishing executive Lovell Thompson. The DeVotos lived in Cambridge for the majority of their lives together.Stegner, Wallace. (1974) The Uneasy Chair: A Biography of Bernard DeVoto. Lincoln: Bison Books.

In addition to being an accomplished cook and book reviewer, Avis DeVoto worked for many years as Bernard\u2019s secretary, handling his correspondence and editing his writing. In 1952, DeVoto received a letter from Julia Child, at that time living in Paris, responding to one of Bernard\u2019s recent magazine columns on kitchen knives. DeVoto\u2019s reply to the letter initiated the correspondence and lifelong friendship between the two women. DeVoto and Child would not meet in person until 1954, but during those first two years they exchanged around 120 letters, which were eventually compiled into a book, As Always, Julia (2010).Garner, Dwight (December 9, 2010), \u201cFriends Who Didn\u2019t Mince Words\u201d: Books of the Times The New York Times.
