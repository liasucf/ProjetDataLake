    "text": "The University of Delaware (colloquially UD or Delaware) is a private-public research university located in Newark, Delaware. UD is the largest university in Delaware. It offers three associate's programs, 148 bachelor's programs, 121 master's programs (with 13 joint degrees), and 55 doctoral programs across its eight colleges. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is considered a large institution with approximately 18,200 undergraduate and 4,200 graduate students. It is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land- grant, sea-grant and space-grant state-supported research institution. UD is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, UD spent $186 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 119th in the nation. It is recognized with the Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. UD is one of only four schools in North America with a major in art conservation. In 1923, it was the first American university to offer a study-abroad program. UD traces its roots to a \"Free School\", founded in New London, Pennsylvania in 1743. The school moved to Newark, Delaware by 1765, becoming the Newark Academy. The academy was responsible for establishing Newark College in 1833 and became part of the college, which changed its name to Delaware College in 1843. While it is not considered one of the colonial colleges because it was not a chartered institution of higher education during the colonial era, its original class of ten students included George Read, Thomas McKean, and James Smith, all three of whom went on to sign the Declaration of Independence. Read also later signed the United States Constitution. ==History== ===Early years: Newark Academy=== The University of Delaware traces its origins to 1743, when Presbyterian minister Francis Alison opened a \"Free School\" in his home in New London, Pennsylvania. During its early years, the school was run under the auspices of the Philadelphia Synod of the Presbyterian Church. The school changed its name and location several times. It moved to Newark by 1765 and received a charter from the colonial Penn government as the Academy of Newark in 1769. In 1781, the academy trustees petitioned the Delaware General Assembly to grant the academy the powers of a college, but no action was taken on this request.Munroe, John A., The University of Delaware: A History (Newark: University of Delaware 1986) ===Transformation to Delaware College=== In 1818, the Delaware legislature authorized the trustees of the Newark Academy to operate a lottery in order to raise funds with which to establish a college.1818 Delaware Laws, Ch. 157. Commencement of the lottery, however, was delayed until 1825, in large part because some trustees, several of whom were Presbyterian ministers, objected to involvement with a lottery on moral grounds. In 1832, the academy trustees selected the site for the college and entered into a contract for the erection of the college building. Construction of that building (now called Old College) began in late 1832 or in 1833. In January 1833 the academy trustees petitioned the Delaware legislature to incorporate the college and on February 5, 1833, the legislature incorporated Newark College, which was charged with instruction in languages, arts and sciences, and granted the power to confer degrees. All of the academy trustees became trustees of the college, and the college absorbed the academy, with Newark Academy becoming the preparatory department of Newark College. Newark College commenced operations on May 8, 1834, with a collegiate department and an academic department, both of which were housed in Old College. In January 1835, the Delaware legislature passed legislation specifically authorizing the Newark Academy trustees to suspend operations and to allow the educational responsibilities of the academy to be performed by the academic department of Newark College. If, however, the college ever ceased to have an academic department, the trustees of the academy were required to revive the academy.1835 Delaware Laws, Ch. 314. In 1841 and 1842 separate classroom and dormitory buildings were constructed to teach and house academic department students. These buildings would later form the east and west wings of the Newark Academy Building located at Main and Academy Streets. In 1843, the name of the college was changed to Delaware College. The college was supported by a state authorized lottery until 1845. By the late 1840s, with the loss of lottery proceeds, the college faced serious financial problems. A scholarship program was adopted to increase enrollment and revenues. Although enrollment did increase to levels that would not be surpassed until the 1900s (there were 118 college students in 1854), the plan was fiscally unsound, and the financial condition of the school deteriorated further. After a student fracas in 1858 resulted in the death of a student, the college suspended operations in 1859, although the academy continued to operate. ===Land-Grant College=== The Civil War delayed the reopening of the college. In 1867, college trustees lobbied the Delaware legislature for Delaware College to be designated as Delaware's land-grant college pursuant to the Morrill Land-Grant College Act. Introduced by Congressman Justin S. Morrill of Vermont in 1857 and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, the Morrill Land-Grant College Act granted public lands to each state in order to establish schools to teach agriculture and engineering. On Jan. 12, 1869, the Board of Trustees of Delaware College signed an agreement to become the state's land-grant institution. In exchange, the state received a one-half interest in the property of the college and the authority to appoint half of the members of the Board of Trustees. The Morrill Land-Grant College Act granted Delaware the title to 90,000 acres in Montana which it sold and invested the profits into bonds used to fund the college. Delaware College's new status as a semipublic college led to the termination of its official connection with the private academy. In 1869, the Newark Academy was revived as a separate institution operating under the 1769 charter. In 1870, Delaware College reopened. It offered classical, scientific and, as required by its land-grant status, agricultural courses of study. In an effort to boost enrollment, women were admitted to the college between 1872 and 1885. In 1887, Congress passed the Hatch Act, which provided Delaware College with funding with which to establish an agricultural experiment station. In 1890, the college purchased nine acres of land for an experimental farm located next to its campus. In 1890 the college became the recipient of more federal aid when the New Morrill Act was passed. It provided for annual payments to support land-grant colleges. Under the law, the State of Delaware initially received $15,000 per year, which was to be increased by $1,000 per year until it reached $25,000. Delaware College received 80% of this money. (It did not receive all of it because the law provided that in states in which land-grant colleges did not admit black students, an equitable amount of the granted money had to be used to educate the excluded students. Delaware College had never admitted black students (although it had admitted Native American and Asian students), and as a result the state of Delaware established Delaware State College near Dover for black students, which opened in 1892.) In 1891 and 1893 Delaware College received appropriations from the State of Delaware for the construction of new buildings. One new building built with this money was Recitation Hall. As a result of this additional funding, Delaware College was invigorated. New buildings, improved facilities, and additional professors helped the college attract more students. Student life also became more active during this period. In 1889 the first football game involving a team representing the college was played. Also in 1889, the college adopted blue and gold as the school's colors. It was not until 1914, though, that the Women's College opened on an adjoining campus, offering women degrees in Home Economics, Education, and Arts and Sciences. Brick archways at Memorial Hall separated the Men's and Women's campuses and gave rise to the legend of the Kissing Arches (where students would kiss good night before returning to their respective residence halls). In 1921, Delaware College was renamed the University of Delaware, and it officially became a coeducational institution in 1945 when it merged with the Women's College of Delaware. See also: The Blue Hen , Classes of 1920/1921, p. 8 (retrieved December 14, 2017). The university grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century. After World War II, UD enrollment skyrocketed, thanks to the G.I. Bill. In the late 1940s, almost two-thirds of the students were veterans. Since the 1950s, UD has quadrupled its enrollment and greatly expanded its faculty, its academic programs and its research enterprise. In 2010\u201311, the university conducted a feasibility study in support of plans to add a law school focused on corporate and patent law. Only first of three online pages archived. At its completion, the study suggested that the planned addition was not within the university's funding capability given the nation's economic climate at the time. Capital expenses were projected at $100 million, and the operating deficit in the first ten years would be $165 million. The study assumed an initial class of two hundred students entering in the fall of 2015. Widener University has Delaware's only law school. === Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus === On October 23, 2009, the University of Delaware signed an agreement with Chrysler to purchase a shuttered vehicle assembly plant adjacent to the university for $24.25 million as part of Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring plan. Alt URL The university has developed the site into the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus. The site is the new home of UD's College of Health Sciences, which includes teaching and research laboratories and several public health clinics. The STAR Campus also includes research facilities for UD's vehicle-to-grid technology, as well as Delaware Technology Park, SevOne, CareNow, Independent Prosthetics and Orthotics, and the East Coast headquarters of Bloom Energy. In 2020, UD expects to open the Ammon Pinozzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, which will become the new home of the UD-led National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals. Also, Chemours recently opened its global research and development facility, known as the Discovery Hub, on the STAR Campus in 2020. The new Newark Regional Transportation Center on the STAR Campus will serve passengers of Amtrak and regional rail. ==Academics== Memorial Hall in the background and Magnolia Circle in the foreground. {|class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 22em;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" | USNWR graduate school rankings |- | Business | 99-131 |- | Education | 45 |- | Engineering | 47 |} {|class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 22em;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" | USNWR departmental rankings |- | Biological Sciences | 140 |- | Chemistry | 59 |- | Clinical Psychology | 36 |- | Computer Science | 68 |- | Criminology | 15 |- | Earth Sciences | 78 |- | Engineering | 58 |- | English | 77 |- | Fine Arts |157 |- | History | 91 |- | Mathematics | 74 |- | Physical Therapy | 1 |- | Physics | 71 |- | Political Science | 81 |- | Psychology | 66 |- | Public Affairs | 39 |- | Sociology | 63 |} The university is organized into eight colleges: * Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics *College of Agriculture and Natural Resources * College of Arts and Sciences * College of Earth, Ocean and Environment * College of Education and Human Development * College of Engineering * College of Health Sciences *Graduate College There are also five schools: * Joseph R.

The university offers more than 150 undergraduate degree programs and, due to the number of academic options, many students complete dual degrees as well as double majors and minors. UD students have access to work and internship opportunities, worldwide study abroad programs, research and service learning programs. ==Campus== The campus itself is divided into four areas: *Main Campus, which has most of the academic and residential buildings, is centered on a roughly north\u2013south axis between South College Avenue and Academy Street. At the center of the campus is Memorial Hall, which once divided the Women's College from Delaware College. North and south of Memorial Hall is a large, roughly rectangular green space known either as \"The Green\" or \"The Mall,\" around which are many of the oldest buildings on campus. Though the buildings were constructed at various times over the course of more than a century, they follow a cohesive Georgian design aesthetic. The Green area is further subdivided into three areas. \"North Central,\" which is north of Delaware Avenue, contains the original men's dormitories (now co-educational) of what was then Delaware College, as well as several classroom buildings north of Main Street in what had been the original Engineering departments. \"Central,\" which lies between Delaware Avenue and Memorial Hall, contains many large classroom buildings and laboratories. \"South Central,\" which extends from Memorial Hall to Park Place, houses the original Women's dormitories, as well as some classroom buildings and the Morris Library. Other areas around the Main Campus include \"Harrington Beach,\" a large grassy quadrangle on the east side of main campus that serves as a common meeting and recreation place for students, and is surrounded by three large dormitory complexes and the Perkins Student Center. Several more classroom and laboratory buildings line the streets on either side of The Green, and there exists an area of closed dormitories (the former Dickinson and Rodney dormitory complexes) that lie at the outer edge of Main Campus across South Main Street. *Laird Campus, which has several dormitories as well as a conference center, hotel, and the Christiana Towers apartment complex, lies north of Cleveland Avenue between New London Road and North College Avenue. The Christiana Towers are slated for demolition in 2021 or 2022 due to their age and expensive maintenance issues. *South Campus has the agricultural school, all of the sports stadiums (including Delaware Stadium and the Bob Carpenter Center), and the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus, which is built on the site of a former vehicle assembly plant. It lies south of the Northeast rail corridor and north of Christina Parkway (Delaware Route 4) *The Delaware Technology Park, which lies to the far east of Main Campus, is designated north of the train tracks and south of Wyoming Road on either side of Library Avenue (Delaware Route 72) and has several research laboratories, classroom buildings, and offices. The Children's Campus, located across the street from the Delaware Technology Park, is a 15-acre site home to the Early Learning Center (ages 6 weeks to third grade), the Lab School (ages 6 months to kindergarten) and The College School (first to eighth grades). Also located on-site are UD's Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners Program and the Center for Disabilities Studies. In 1891, prominent Philadelphia architect Frank Furness designed Recitation Hall. Several buildings (Wolf, Sussex, and Harter Halls) were designed by Frank Miles Day, who also designed the formal campus landscape. From 1918 to 1952, Marian Cruger Coffin was appointed the university's landscape architect, a position which required her to unite the university's two separate campuses (the men's to the north and the women's to the south) into one cohesive design.Ben-Joseph, E., Ben-Joseph, H.D., & Dodge, A.C. Against all Odds: MIT's Pioneering Women of Landscape Architecture . MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2006. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them with a circle (now called Magnolia Circle) instead of curving the straight paths, which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.Hail, M.W. \"The Art of Landscaping \". University of Delaware Messenger, Vol. 2, No. 2, p. 4, (Winter) 1993. North, or Laird, Campus, formerly home to the Pencader Complex, has been entirely redesigned and renamed Independence Complex. This began with the construction of a Marriott Courtyard run by the HRIM (Hotel Restaurant and Institutional Management) department. Four residence hall buildings have been built, three named after the three University alumni who signed the Declaration of Independence (George Read, Thomas McKean, and James Smith, who signed for Pennsylvania); the fourth residence hall was named Independence Hall. Other major facilities that have opened since 2000 include: * The David and Louise Roselle Center For The Arts, with facilities for the school's music and theater programs, was opened in 2006. It is named for the university's 25th president and his wife. * In 2013, two new residence halls, named after former college president Eliphalet Gilbert and Delaware Civil Rights pioneer Louis L. Redding, were opened on the East Campus housing complex. * Also in 2013, the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (ISE) Laboratory opened on the corner of Academy and Lovett streets. In 2015, it was named the Patrick T. Harker ISE Laboratory in honor of the university's 26th president. * The Caesar Rodney Residence and Dining Hall opened in fall 2015 on Academy Street across from Perkins Student Center. * The South Academy Residence Hall opened in fall 2017 next to Caesar Rodney Residence Hall. * The Tower at STAR opened on the STAR Campus in 2018. ==Administration== In 2015, the UD Board of Trustees elected Dennis Assanis as the 28th President of the University of Delaware; he took office in June 2016. He succeeded Nancy , former Dean of the University's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, who served as interim president in 2015\u201316.

Among those sources is the State of Delaware budget. In fiscal year 2018, the state operating appropriation was 12% of the university's operating revenue. Tuition and fees (net of scholarships and fellowships) make up 43% of the university's operating budget. The Delaware First fundraising and engagement campaign is the largest philanthropic campaign in UD history. Launched in November 2017, the campaign goal is to raise $750 million by summer 2020. As of spring 2019, the campaign had raised about $700 million. ==Study abroad== The University of Delaware was the first American university to begin a study-abroad program, which was later adopted by many other institutions. The program began when Professor Raymond Watson Kirkbride took a group of eight students to Paris, France, during the fall semester of 1923. Since this initial trip, the University of Delaware has expanded its study-abroad program, which now encompasses more than 40 countries. About one-third of UD undergraduate students take advantage of study-abroad experiences prior to completing their bachelor's degrees. Delaware's study-abroad program offers many options for students. Undergraduates have the option of studying abroad for a five-week winter or summer session, or an entire semester. ==Athletics== Dupont Hall on the Central Green, College of Engineering The athletic teams at Delaware are known as the Fightin' Blue Hens with a mascot named YoUDee. YoUDee is a Blue Hen Chicken, after the team names and the state bird of Delaware. YoUDee was elected into the mascot hall of fame in 2006, and is an eight-time UCA Open Division Mascot National Champion.

It is an independent publication and receives no financial support from the university. It is distributed at several locations across campus, including Morris Library, the Perkins Student Center and the Trabant University Center, as well as various academic buildings and the dining halls. The Review's office is located at 250 Perkins Student Center, facing Academy Street, and is above the offices of WVUD. In 2004, it was a National Newspaper Pacemaker Award Finalist, and was also named one of the ten best non-daily college newspapers by the Associated Collegiate Press. It currently has a print circulation of 10,000. UDress magazine is the on-campus fashion magazine which publishes one issue per semester, in conjunction with fashion events. ====Broadcast==== The student-run, non-commercial, educational radio station at Delaware broadcasts on 91.3 and uses the call letters WVUD, which the university purchased from the University of Dayton in the 1980s. Although not its intended call letter pronunciation, 'VUD has taken on the slogan \"the Voice of the University of Delaware.\" They are licensed by the city of Newark, Delaware and broadcasts with a power of 1,000 watts 24 hours a day with its offices and studios located in the Perkins Student Center. The transmitting facilities are located atop the Christiana East Tower residence hall. WVUD is operated by University of Delaware students, a University staff of two, and community members. No prior radio experience is necessary, nor is there a need to enroll in any certain major to become a part of WVUD. The radio station has a variety of programming, featuring both music and talk formats. STN is the student-run, non-commercial, educational television station at the University of Delaware. The station broadcasts second-run movies, original student produced content as well as live sports coverage. The initials, STN, originally stood for Shane Thomas Network, later changed to Student Television Network. ===Greek life=== Approximately 25% of the University of Delaware's undergraduate student population is affiliated with a fraternity or sorority. There are over 26 fraternities and 20 sororities (chapters & colonies) in the Interfraternity Council (IFC), National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), and Multicultural Greek Congress (MGC). They all coordinate via the Greek Council. All Greek organizations participate in an accreditation process called the Chapter Assessment Program (CAP). CAP ratings award chapters with either a Gold, Silver, Bronze, Satisfactory or Needs Improvement designation. This system is an expansion from the Five Star program of the late 1990s, requiring contributions to community service, philanthropy, university events, diversity education, professional education, a chapter/colony GPA greater than or equal to the all men's or all women's average, and attendance and compliance with numerous other criteria. Active fraternities include Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, Phi Kappa Tau, Phi Beta Sigma, Lambda Sigma Upsilon, Pi Alpha Phi, Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Sigma Pi, Alpha Sigma Phi, Kappa Delta Rho, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Gamma Rho, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Pi, Sigma Phi Delta, Theta Chi, Kappa Alpha Order, Pi Kappa Phi, Zeta Beta Tau, Sigma Nu, Phi Gamma Delta, and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

On this survey, a majority of students reported binge drinking more than once in a two-week interval. The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that they drink on 10 or more occasions per month. UD students were found to be more aware of policies, prevention programs, and enforcement risks than the national average. In 2005, on the Newark campus of the university 1140 students were picked up by the campus police for alcohol-related violations. Of these, 120 led to arrests. These figures are up from previous years, 1062 in 2004 and 1026 in 2003. This represents approximately 6% of the student population. At least one student organization has undertaken the goal of \"providing fun activities for those who chose not to drink\" and to \"promote the idea that one doesn't need alcohol to have a good time.\" In 2008, a University of Delaware freshman died of alcohol poisoning after attending a party hosted by members of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, where the student was pledging. Although the university has attempted to make efforts in preventing alcohol abuse, a student visiting from another college died on March 19, 2016 in an alcohol- related incident. The student was standing alone on the roof of an off-campus fraternity, and slipped off it. ===Shuttle service=== University of Delaware shuttle bus The University of Delaware operates multiple shuttle routes called \"UD Shuttle\" that serve the campus. The North/South Academy route runs the north\u2013south length of the campus via Academy Street and offers daily service, with late night service Friday and Saturday. The North/South College route runs the north\u2013south length of the campus via College Avenue and offers service on weekdays. The East Loop route runs a loop through the eastern part of the campus and Newark and offers daily service, with late night service Friday and Saturday. The West Loop route runs a loop through the western part of the campus and Newark and offers daily service, with late night service Friday and Saturday. The Early Bird route offers early morning weekday service serving the north\u2013south length of the campus while the Late Bird route offers late night service daily serving the north\u2013south length of the campus. ==Health== The University of Delaware Emergency Care Unit (UDECU) is a registered student organization at the university, which provides emergency medical services to the campus and surrounding community. UDECU has approximately 50 members, all of which are volunteers and students at the University of Delaware. UDECU operates one basic life support ambulance (UD-1), one first response vehicle (UD-2), and a bike team. Advanced life support is provided by New Castle County Emergency Medical Services. ==Controversies== ===Power plant=== The university agreed to lease 43 acres on the STAR campus to The Data Centers (TDC) for the construction of the data center. The data center plan included a combined heat cycle natural gas-fired power plant capable of generating 279 megawatts of energy. TDC claimed that the power plant was critical to ensuring an uninterrupted electrical power supply to the facility, which is critical for data integrity. The TDC business plan also called for sale of excess electricity. Portions of the Newark community questioned the business plan, claiming that the power plant is not an auxiliary part of the data center but a separate industrial use, which would violate the zoning of the STAR campus. On April 28, 2014, the City of Newark Board of Adjustment upheld its April 19, 2014 ruling that the power plant is an accessory to the data center and that no rezoning was required. The ruling is presently under appeal. The University of Delaware's Sustainability Task Force sent an open letter to President Harker citing concerns that the project violates the university's strategic plan and Climate Action Plan. On May 4, 2014, the University Faculty Senate voted 43 to 0 (with 8 abstentions) to recommend to the administration that it not allow construction of The Data Center on UD's STAR campus if The Data Center includes any fossil-fuel-burning power plant. On July 10, 2014 the university announced that it was terminating the lease for the project. ===Orientation=== In the fall of 2007, the university implemented a new residence-life education program that was criticized for forcing students into polarizing discussions. The program was abandoned in November. ==Notable alumni and faculty== Notable alumni of the University of Delaware include the 47th Vice President of the United States and former U.S. Senator Joe Biden (B.A. 1965); former Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden (B.A. 1976); former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (B.A. 1984); campaign manager David Plouffe (B.A. 2010); Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist Daniel Nathans (B.S. 1950); Nobel Prize-winning organic chemist Richard F.
