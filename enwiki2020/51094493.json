Transferred to Cyrenaica, he held several positions (secretary general in Benghazi, regional commissioner in Derna), including that of director (1919), until the disagreement with the governor Giacomo De Martino on the conciliation policy implemented with the Senussi forced him to a new series of transfers: first in Somalia, from 1922 in Tripolitania and then from June of the following year again in Cyrenaica. After being long director general of the Ministry of Colonies (1924-1930), from mid-July 1930 until mid-January 1935 he was governor of Eritrea.S. Maggi.

Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, Naples 1996, p. 68 He promoted the construction of the railway from Asmara to the border with Sudan, but WW2 blocked this project. Placed in retirement, he continued to hold important positions, mainly of study and research. Furthermore, even after the end of WW2, he was president of the Italian-African Institute, a member of the Institute for the East and a member of the foreign policy commission of the Christian Democracy party. He promoted in the late 1940s the return to Italian administration of the former Italian colonies in Africa, but he was successful only with Somalia. He died in his villa in Francavilla al Mare, not far away from Naples, in 1952. ==Writings== In his writings of the late 1920s he paid attention to Africa's problems, advocating the possibility of incorporating it into the European socio-political structure (\"Eurafrica\"), while those of the late 1930s deal with the problem of race, adhering, in line with the spirit of the fascist racial laws of the period, to the \"canon\" of safeguarding Aryan purity in AfricaTreccani: Astuto di Lucchese . *La legge organica per l'impero dell'Africa Orientale Italiana, in Rassegna italiana, XIX (1936), pp. 641-651. *L'impero italiano nel quadro generale dell'Africa, in L'Impero (A.O.I.).
