She played the role of Razia in Sohan Roy's Dam, which may have been based on the Mullaperiyar Dam dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The DMK party chief M. Karunanidhi urged the Tamil Nadu chief minister J.Jayalalitha to ban the movie for \"people's safety\". A day before its scheduled release on 25 November, the film was banned by the State Government on grounds that its release would disturb relations between Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
