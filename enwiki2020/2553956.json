    "text": "Jacques Celestin Songo'o (born 17 March 1964) is a Cameroonian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper, and the current goalkeeper coach of Cameroon. He spent the vast majority of his professional career in France and Spain, most notably with Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, appearing in more than 200 official games over the course of six seasons and winning the 1999\u20132000 La Liga. Songo'o represented the Cameroon national team in four World Cups, being first-choice in 1998. ==Club career== Songo'o was born in Sackbayeme, in the Yaound\u00e9 suburbs. After first establishing himself as a professional in France, with Ligue 1 club FC Metz, he was voted Best African Goalkeeper in 1996, then arguably lived his most successful period at Spain's Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a. With the Galicians, Songo'o won the 1996\u201397 edition of the Ricardo Zamora Trophy (awarded to the best goalkeeper of the season), and was his side's undisputed starter in his first four years, which ended with a first-ever title in La Liga. When Depor bought Jos\u00e9 Francisco Molina in 2000, he soon lost his place and was eventually transferred to old team Metz; on 13 February of that year, from a corner kick, he was supposed to have scored his first career goal, but it was wrongfully disallowed in a 0\u20131 away loss against CD Numancia. After two seasons, Songo'o returned to Deportivo and A Coru\u00f1a, again in a free transfer. He settled there after having retired from football, aged 40. ==International career== Songo'o featured for Cameroon in every FIFA World Cup from 1990 to 2002, although only as first-choice in 1998. He was also a member of the squad that competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After retiring in 2004, Songo'o was hired as the national team's goalkeeper coach. He left the position in 2006, returning four years later as a replacement for Thomas N'Kono. In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Songo'o was part of Paul Le Guen's coaching staff. After the tournament, which ended in the group stage, he led Cameroon to a 3\u20130 victory over Poland on an interim basis, the nation's first win in ten competitive games. Songo'o returned for a third spell in the same capacity in September 2019, now under newly hired manager Toni Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. ==Personal life== Songo'o also held French citizenship. Both of his sons, Franck and Yann, were also professional footballers. ==Honours== ===Club=== Canon *Elite One: 1984\u201385, 1985\u201386 *Cameroonian Cup: 1985\u201386 Metz *Coupe de la Ligue: 1995\u201396 Deportivo *La Liga: 1999\u20132000 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2000 ===International=== Cameroon *Africa Cup of Nations: 1988, 2002 ===Individual=== *Ricardo Zamora Trophy: 1996\u201397 ==References== ==External links== * * * Deportivo archives * * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Cameroonian descent Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Canon Yaound\u00e9 players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:Sporting Club Toulon players Category:Le Mans FC players Category:FC Metz players Category:La Liga players Category:Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a players Category:Cameroon international footballers Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2001 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:1984 African Cup of Nations players Category:1988 African Cup of Nations players Category:1992 African Cup of Nations players Category:1998 African Cup of Nations players Category:2002 African Cup of Nations players Category:Olympic footballers of Cameroon Category:Footballers at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Cameroonian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
