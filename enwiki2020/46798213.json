From 1914 to 1919 the company acquired shares of water rights and contracts with mine owners in Iceland. In 1927 the company received permission to build a power station at Urri\u00f0afoss but was unable to raise capital for construction. The company became dormant and was wound up in 1951. ==Origins== Fr\u00edmann B. Arngr\u00edmsson came to Iceland in 1894 with proposals to mobilize water power to illuminate streets and buildings, but did not obtain backing. He met the poet and entrepreneur Einar Benediktsson, who encouraged him. Einar became fascinated by the potential of hydroelectric power, and his poetry discusses the power of waterfalls. In 1906 he began to engage in power generation enterprises, joining the boards of two companies, Skj\u00e1lfanda and Gigant. These were formed to build and operate hydroelectric power plants, particularly the northern waterfalls of the Skj\u00e1lfandaflj\u00f3t and J\u00f6kuls\u00e1 \u00e1 Fj\u00f6llum rivers. In the fall of 1907 Einar Benediktsson travelled overseas to try to attract foreign capital to Iceland. He saw Norway as a model, a poor country that had used foreign investment to develop heavy industry. Over the next years Einar worked hard to establish overseas companies to exploit Icelandic waterfalls, and to buy or lease water rights in many of Iceland's major streams. His main partners were the brothers Sturla and Fri\u00f0rik Sturlubr\u00e6\u00f0ur, two of the wealthiest merchants in Reykjav\u00edk. Fund raising began, but there was opposition from people who objected to foreign involvement. Parliament passed a new law on waterfalls in 1907 that imposed further restrictions. ==Foundation== Urri\u00f0afoss waterfall on the \u00dej\u00f3rsj\u00e1 In 1914 Einar Benediktsson was one of the founders of Fossaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 T\u00edtan and three sister companies Sirius, Orion and Taurus, established to harness the power of the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 waterfalls. Titan was the largest of the companies, and later absorbed the others. The Titan company was established in February 1914 with a nominal capital of ISK 12 million, double the budget of the state of Iceland. The Norwegians associated with the company included highly regarded lawyers, engineers and businessmen in Kristiania (now Oslo). They were led by Oluf Aall, a Supreme Court Attorney who was chairman of the Titan company for many years. Oluf Aall was ten years younger than Einar Benediktsson, and specialized in legal counseling for Norwegian companies in foreign enterprises. He was chairman of many companies, was wealthy in his own right and was active in Norwegian politics. Icelanders who were involved in Titan from the first included the Sturlubr\u00e6\u00f0ur brothers and the lawyer Eggert Claessen. ==Operations== The company obtained share capital, purchased water rights and carried out extensive surveys of \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 and its surroundings. Norwegian engineers undertook the surveys led by Gotfred S\u00e6tersmoen, who was also a member of the board of directors. The studies of the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 were undertaken in 1915\u201317. In 1918 the company published the book Vandkraften i Thjors\u00e1 elv, Island which gave the results of the research and described the company's plans. The B\u00farfell Power Plant was by far the largest of the planned power plants, but the Urri\u00f0afoss power plant was to be the first. Parliament had set up a water committee to draft a future energy policy, and the management of Fossaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 T\u00edtan hoped this committee would support their plans. On 20 March 1919 Titan applied for a concession to use all the power of the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 river. The committee submitted its proposals in 1919. It was thought to be mostly based on Titan's application, and indicated that the government was in favor of development of the power plants. Despite this, changes in the needs of heavy industry and the crisis that followed World War I (1914\u201318) had the effect of considerably reducing the influence of Titan. The company continued planning, and Einer visited America to try to obtain funding, but did not succeed. However, after the railway company gave its backing to the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1r power plant there was renewed support for Titan, and by a law of 31 May 1927 the company was granted permission to harness Urri\u00f0afoss on the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1. The proposed power plant was to generate up to . It was assumed that the river would deliver about rather than the that is delivered today. Due to shortage of funds none of the power plants were built, and the company became dormant. It was officially wound up in 1951. Hj\u00e1lparfoss, a waterfall in south Iceland off the Foss\u00e1 river ==Water rights== In 1914 Titan obtained rights to use the \u00dej\u00f3fafoss, Tr\u00f6llkonufoss and Glj\u00fafurleitarfoss falls along the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 river. The company continued to purchase water rights from other southern municipalities, including a stake in Skei\u00f0ahreppur on the H\u00e1foss and Hj\u00e1lparfoss on the Foss\u00e1 for 3,000 kr\u00f3nur. Einar Benediktsson purchased water rights on the Landmannaafr\u00e9tti in 1916, which he assigned to the company in 1917, and also in 1916 bought water rights in the \u00c1sahreppur, Holtahreppur and Landmannahreppi municipalities which he assigned to the company in 1918. In 1918 the government notified all the municipal officials that the water rights were public property, and that the water committee considered that contracts to sell these rights were invalid. The districts had been granted the right to use the water, but did not own the water and therefore could not sell the rights. However, Fossaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 T\u00edtan retained the rights until 1952, when the rights in the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1, Tungna\u00e1, K\u00f6ldukv\u00edsl, \u00de\u00f3risvatn and other rivers were sold to the Icelandic state for 600,000 Norwegian Kroner and 200,000 Icelandic Kroner. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * Category:Energy companies of Iceland Category:Energy companies established in 1914 Category:1914 establishments in Iceland Category:Energy companies disestablished in 1951 Category:1951 disestablishments in Iceland ",
