    "text": "\"Gimme Shelter\" is the opening track to the 1969 album Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones. Greil Marcus, writing in Rolling Stone magazine at the time of its release, praised the song, stating that the band has \"never done anything better\". Although the first word was spelled \"Gimmie\" on that album, subsequent recordings by the band and other musicians have made \"Gimme\" the customary spelling. It is on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, and is also the 33rd best ranked song on critics' all-time lists according to Acclaimed Music. ==Inspiration and recording== \"Gimme Shelter\" was written by the Rolling Stones' lead vocalist Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards, the band's primary songwriting team. Richards began working on the song's signature opening riff in London whilst Jagger was away filming Performance with Richards' then-girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg. In his autobiography Life, Richards revealed that the tension of the song was inspired by his jealousy at seeing the relationship between Pallenberg and Jagger, and his suspicions of an affair between them. As released, the song begins with Richards performing a guitar intro, soon joined by Jagger's lead vocal. Of Let It Bleeds bleak world view, Jagger said in a 1995 interview with Rolling Stone magazine: Similarly, on NPR in 2012: However, the song's inspiration was not initially Vietnam or social unrest, but Keith Richards seeing people scurrying for shelter from a sudden rain storm. According to him: The recording features guest vocals by Merry Clayton, recorded at a last- minute late-night recording session during the mixing phase, arranged by her friend and record producer Jack Nitzsche. After the first verse is sung by Jagger, Merry Clayton enters and they share the next three verses. A harmonica solo by Jagger and guitar solo by Richards follow. Then, with great energy, Clayton repeatedly sings \"Rape, murder! It's just a shot away! It's just a shot away!\", almost screaming the final stanza. She and Jagger then repeat the line \"It's just a shot away\" and finish with repeats of \"It's just a kiss away\". When speaking of her inclusion in the recording, Jagger stated in the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones that the Rolling Stones' producer Jimmy Miller thought of having a female singer on the track and told fellow producer Jack Nitzsche to contact one: \"The use of the female voice was the producer's idea. It would be one of those moments along the lines of 'I hear a girl on this track - get one on the phone.'\" Summoned from bed around midnight by Nitzsche, Clayton - heavily pregnant - made her recording with just a few takes and then returned home to bed. It remains the most prominent contribution to a Rolling Stones track by a female vocalist.Unterberger, Richie. [ \"Gimme Shelter\"]. allmusic.com (2007). Accessed 20 May 2007. At about 2:59 into the song, Clayton's voice cracks under the strain; once during the second refrain on the word \"shot\", then on the word \"murder\" during the third refrain, after which Jagger is faintly heard exclaiming \"Woo!\" in response to Clayton's powerful delivery. Upon returning home, Clayton suffered a miscarriage, attributed by some sources to her exertions during the recording. Merry Clayton's name was erroneously written on the original release, appearing as 'Mary'. Her name is also listed as 'Mary' on the 2002 Let It Bleed remastered CD.Jagger, M., Richards, K., \"Let It Bleed.\" Album credits. 2002\\. CD. The song was recorded in London at Olympic Studios in February and March 1969; the vocals were recorded in Los Angeles at Sunset Sound Recorders and Elektra Studios in October and November that same year.Rolling Stones and the Making of Let It Bleed, by Sean Egan, () Nicky Hopkins played piano, Jimmy Miller played percussion, Charlie Watts played drums, Bill Wyman played bass, Jagger played harmonica and sang backup vocals with Richards and Clayton. Guitarist Brian Jones was present during the early sessions but did not contribute, Richards being credited with both rhythm and lead guitars on the album sleeve. For the recording, Richards used an Australian-made Maton SE777, a large single-cutaway hollowbody guitar, which he had previously used on \"Midnight Rambler\". The guitar barely survived the recording before literally falling apart. \"[O]n the very last note of 'Gimmie Shelter,'\" Richards told Guitar World in 2002, \"the whole neck fell off. You can hear it on the original take.\" ==Releases on compilation albums and live recordings== \"Gimme Shelter\" quickly became a staple of the Rolling Stones' live shows. It was first performed sporadically during their 1969 American Tour and became a regular addition to their setlist during the 1972 American Tour. A version recorded in Oakland, CA is on the bootleg Live'r Than You'll Ever Be.

Blige, Florence Welch, and Lady Gaga. \"Gimme Shelter\" was never released as a single.
