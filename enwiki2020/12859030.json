The sanctuary is located between the fishing village of Camarones and the Tapias River, surrounded by estuaries and marshes including Manzanillo, Laguna Grande, Ci\u00e9naga del Nav\u00edo Quebrado and Tocoromanes marshes. Many other shore and water birds can be found in the sanctuary such as roseate spoonbills, great egrets, laughing gulls and many others. The surrounding xerophytic scrub habitat is also home to many endemic birds such as buffy hummingbirds, white-whiskered spinetails, Tocuyo sparrows, and vermilion cardinals.
