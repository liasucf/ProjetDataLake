It combines sodium sulfacetamide, a sulfonamide antibiotic, and sulfur, a keratolytic agent. It is available in four formulations: as a cleansing cloth, cleanser, topical suspension, and as a facial mask. The sulfacetamide inhibits the growth of the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes that is associated with acne, while sulfur facilitates the removal of dead skin cells to prevent clogged pores. == References == Category:Anti-acne preparations Category:Combination drugs ",
