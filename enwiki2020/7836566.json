Due to its proximity with Plaza Rakyat as it was opened, the concourse level of the Plaza Rakyat station was originally intended to directly link the south side of the complex. With Plaza Rakyat incomplete, a 150-metre-long covered pedestrian bridge and walkway was provided to connect the station to the south of the nearby Pudu Sentral bus station. Due to the suspension of the construction project, the pedestrian bridge continues to serve passengers entering and leaving the station until now. The station is located near the site of the old Sultan Street railway station. ===Connection to MRT Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line=== The Plaza Rakyat LRT station is an interchange station with Merdeka MRT station since 17 July 2017. It was initially meant to be only a connecting station without paid zone-to- paid zone integration, but a later update included paid zone-to-paid zone integration, where commuters do not need to tap out and purchase new tickets to transit to the other line. A covered and air-conditioned 180 metres pedestrian walkway was built, connecting the paid-area concourses of the two stations. ==Around the station== * Stadium Negara * Victoria Institution (also served by Hang Tuah LRT/Monorail) * Maybank Tower * Petaling Street * Pudu Sentral * Confucian Private Secondary School * Methodist Boys' School ==See also== * List of rail transit stations in Klang Valley Category:Ampang Line Category:Railway stations opened in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Malaysia ",
