    "text": "The 1991 Barcelona City Council election, also the 1991 Barcelona municipal election, was held on Sunday, 26 May 1991, to elect the 4th City Council of the municipality of Barcelona. All 43 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Barcelona (, ) was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Barcelona, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Barcelona and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes\u2014which included blank ballots\u2014being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"120\"| Population ! width=\"265\"| Councillors |- | <250 | 5 |- | 251\u20131,000 | 7 |- | 1,001\u20132,000 | 9 |- | 2,001\u20135,000 | 11 |- | 5,001\u201310,000 | 13 |- | 10,001\u201320,000 | 17 |- | 20,001\u201350,000 | 21 |- | 50,001\u2013100,000 | 25 |- | >100,001 | +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number |} The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Barcelona, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 22 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Barcelona. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line- height:16px;\" |- style=\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\" !
