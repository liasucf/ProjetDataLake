    "text": "{| |} The Miles M.77 Sparrowjet was a twin-engined jet-powered racing aircraft built by F.G. Miles Limited by fitting Turbomeca Palas jets to the prototype Miles Sparrowhawk. ==Design and development== The conversion commenced in January 1951 and the Sparrowjet first flew on 14 December 1953. Other modifications included a new tail section and front fuselage (in place of the Sparrowhawk's single engine), fixed, faired-in undercarriage and a large clear canopy. The wing roots were modified to take the Palas engines. ==Operational history== ===Air racing history=== Leeds (Yeadon) Airport in 1955 The prototype M.5 Sparrowhawk G-ADNL was bought by Fred Dunkerley's Oldham Tyre Cord Company in January 1951. It was modified to M.77 Sparrowjet standard, and first flown by Dunkerley in air races during the Goodyear Air Challenge Trophy at Shoreham on 28 August 1954. It flew for display at Baginton during the Royal Aero Club race in July but had been prevented from racing owing to an air starter fault. He won the SBAC Challenge Cup at Yeadon, West Yorkshire in 1956 and the King's Cup Race in 1957 with a top speed of 228 mph (367 km/h). The Sparrowjet was severely damaged in a hangar fire at Upavon, Wiltshire in July 1964. In 2004 it was under rebuild in the Bristol area using discarded components from the 1950/53 conversion. The rebuild was still ongoing in early 2012. ==Specifications (Sparrowjet)== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Amos, Peter. and Don Lambert Brown. Miles Aircraft Since 1925, Volume 1.
