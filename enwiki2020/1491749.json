Zula (meaning quails territory) was one of this towns established on the shore of the Lerma river. In 1380, Tari\u00e1curi purepecha's king, conquered the town of Zula and named it Aramutaro, which means place with caves. Almost two centuries later, Antonio de Villarroel serving Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n took control of the town on the San Sebastian's day of 1530 (January 20), so renaming the town as \"San Sebasti\u00e1n de Aramutarillo\". From 1530 to 1687, San Sebastian was in total oblivion, victim of slavery and ignorance; nevertheless there were two historic facts, which changed course for the town, one political affair and another religious matter. The religious matter refers to a finding of a branch from a tree resembling Jesus Christ on the Cross. This happened the midnight of Christmas Eve on a place called Buena Huerta. The towns in its surrounding asked for the Jesus Christ image to be taken to their churches. San Sebasti\u00e1n de Aramutarillo was selected to keep the Christ image. After that, the Christ image was called \"Se\u00f1or de La Piedad\" (Lord of Mercy) where Templo del Senor de La Piedad was built in its honor, which also has the biggest dome in the country. The political affair was the movement of political offices from Tlazazalca to San Sebastian de Aramutarillo. This causes that many people came to offer merchandise, crafts, etc. In this way the town was officially founded in 1692, when Juan L\u00f3pez de Aguirre named it as La Piedad. ==Attractions== Places of interest include the town center with its kiosco (bandstand) built with quarried stone, the gateways, and the Se\u00f1or de La Piedad church, which boasts perhaps the biggest dome in the country. Also of note are the Cabadas Bridge and the 30-metre-high El Salto waterfall. The local zoo and \"La Torre de la Gaviota\" located at the Ciudad del Sol neighborhood, are also places of interest in La Piedad. There are also urban parks such as Morelos Park and La Placa park. The city is known because of its colorful Rebozos, and the singer Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez made it more famous with the song \"El Perro Negro\" (\"The Black Dog\"). ==Industry== La Piedad is a hub for agricultural products. The town was once known as the center of the Mexican pork industry, and still plays an important part in that industry. However, La Piedad has recently moved its economy towards textiles. Major textil manufacturers include Olmeca, Marval and Manriquez. Surrounding towns are Santa Ana, Yurecuaro, Degollado, Numaran, and Ecuandureo. La Piedad is also the headquarters for veterinary pharmaceuticals company LaPisa and industrial turbine manufacturer Turbomaquinas and Famaq. Also there is an important candy factory named Cabadas and sausage factories like Nu-tres, Delta and Bafar (former Parma). Most companies are family owned and operated. These are Salda\u00f1a and Garc\u00eda, the latter owns Turbomaquinas S.A. de C.V., FAMAQ, Turboaleaciones S.A. de C.V. and the former owns Grupo Kasto. There are 569 companies registered in the municipality, which puts La Piedad in the top four cities in the state with the greatest number of companies, after Morelia, Uruapan, and Zamora.
