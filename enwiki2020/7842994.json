The foundation stone was laid by Lady Georgina Vernon of Hanbury Hall. The church of St. Matthias & St. George was originally designed by W. J. Hopkins as a large church with a south tower, only the east end was completed by him in 1884. The nave was added by W. Cogswell in 1911 and consecrated by Bishop Louis Mylne. The tower was never built hence the deep sloping roof. The church was built as a chapelry of Feckenham.
