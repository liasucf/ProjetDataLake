What you in that studio with those people affects the next however many years of your career and if you play your cards right, it can change your life. It really felt like a make or break situation. The 'Pressure' to make the perfect Wage War album, one that harvests what people have come to love about our band yet still grow and explore new territory and push ourselves harder than ever before.\" \"However, that's not the only pressure this album talks about. There are songs on the album that deal with mental health, and the pressure to act 'ok' even when things aren't. There are songs on the album that speaking of not succumbing to pressure and being just another face in the crowd, but more so making a change in yourself and the world around you. Being in a band, making music, playing shows in one way or another all comes with a 'Pressure' and how you deal with it is what determines who you are. This record is our response.\" ==Recording== When asked about recording the album, Cody Quistad stated: \"We were all out of our comfort zone, which was really cool, we couldn\u2019t just go home after the day. We all lived in the same house. It was a great opportunity for us to reconnect. We'd go to shows together, come back, and write at 2am. Los Angeles is inspiring, because there's a youthful drive and passion. Everyone is there to chase a dream. It gives you a mindset. You talk about going to L.A. to make a record when you're 13. It was a bucket list thing for us.\" \"Low\" was the first song to be completed after the release of Deadweight. \"It started as most songs do with the main riff.\" The band recorded a demo of it while on Vans Warped Tour 2018. \"We went back to Andrew Wade and Jeremy McKinnon for the production and engineering side of things and were honored to have metal legend, Mark Lewis, mix it! The song went through many structure changes before landing on what it is today. 'Low' represents everything you've come to expect from Wage War, but in its most refined state.\" ==Promotion== In addition to the album news, the band announced a fall headlining tour. Kicking off September 27, just a few weeks after their Worcester Self Help Fest appearance, Wage War will be hitting the road with Like Moths to Flames, Polaris, and Dayseeker. ==Track listing== == Personnel == Wage War * Briton Bond \u2013 lead vocals, clean vocals, additional guitar on \"Hurt\" * Cody Quistad \u2013 rhythm guitar, clean vocals * Seth Blake \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Chris Gaylord \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * Stephen Kluesener \u2013 drums Production * Drew Fulk \u2013 composer, engineer, mixing, producer * Jeff Dunne - engineer, mixing, mastering * Andrew Wade \u2013 producer, engineer (Track 7) * Jeremy McKinnon \u2013 producer, engineer (Track 7) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 67 |- |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Wage War albums Category:Fearless Records albums ",
