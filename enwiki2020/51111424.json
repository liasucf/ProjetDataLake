His parents moved to Australia when he was an infant and settled in Ballarat, Victoria, where he attended Ballarat High School and the Ballarat School of Mines. In 1893, Allsop moved to South Africa, where he worked as a metallurgical assayer for a Johannesburg-based gold mining firm. He later helped to establish a cyanide plant at Spitzkop (near Lydenburg). Allsop returned to Australia in 1896 and lived in Victoria until 1905, when he moved to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He served on the Kalgoorlie Municipal Council from 1921 to 1930, including as mayor from 1922 to 1927. At the 1928 Legislative Council elections, Allsop contested North-East Province as an independent, but was defeated by the sitting Nationalist member, Harold Seddon.
