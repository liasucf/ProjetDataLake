    "text": "Kunnam also often called Kunnam of Elam was a military expedition leader of the kingdom of Elam in the 18th century BC. He was part of a military campaign into Mesopotamia and is mainly known from cuneiform letters found at Mari, a Syrian city state where there are the royal archives preserved. He was a contemporary of Zimri-Lim (Mari) and Hammurabi (Babylon). The king of Elam connected with the military expedition is not mentioned in the texts from Mari as agrressor, but for chronological reasons it was most likely Siwe-Palar- Khuppak, who tried to get control over Mesopotamia, attacked several cities and was only defeated in year 30 of king Hammurabi.Daniel T. Potts: The Archaeology of Elam. Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State. Cambridge 1999, , p. 171. Kunnam guided the expedition against Tell Shubat- Enlil (most likely Tell Leilan) and entered the city with a huge army.Wolfgang Hempel: Letters to the King of Mari, Winona Lake, Indiana, , p. 302.
