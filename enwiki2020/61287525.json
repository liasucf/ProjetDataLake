    "text": "Bea Patricia de Guzman Magtanong (born 27 April 1994), popularly known as Patch Magtanong, is a Filipino lawyer, beauty queen and fashion model who was crowned Binibining Pilipinas \u2014 International 2019. Magtanong represented the Philippines at the Miss International 2019 competition on 12 November 2019 in Tokyo, Japan placing in the Top 8. ==Early life and education== Magtanong was born in the province of Bataan, Central Luzon region, Philippines, on 27 April 1994 to a lawyer father and an accountant mother. She grew up idolizing both her parents and their professions, especially her father and his legal practice. While Magtanong's parents never prodded her to study Law and become a lawyer herself, she was always intrigued by the legal profession. In July 2014, Magtanong graduated cum laude with a degree in business economics from the University of the Philippines Diliman, where she would also later study and complete her Juris Doctor (law degree). She was among the 1,800 new Lawyers who took oath in June 2019 after passing the Philippine Bar Examination in October 2018. Magtanong is also a fashion and commercial model. She is a member of the Professional Models Association of the Philippines (PMAP). ==Pageantry== Binibining Pilipinas was Magtanong's first-ever beauty pageant competition. During the finals held on 9 June 2019 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, she was recognized with special awards Bb. Megaworld and Best in Swimsuit. She succeeded Ahtisa Manalo after being crowned 2019 Binibining Pilipinas International, becoming the country's representative to the Miss International 2019 competition slated 12 November at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in Tokyo, Japan. During the 2019 Binibining Pilipinas question and answer round, Magtanong was asked: \u201cIf you could have the opportunity to meet somebody globally influential, who would that be and why?\u201d To which she replied: > \"I really idolize Angelina Jolie because she is blessed with not just a > thriving career in Hollywood, but then as a woman, she is able to use that > influence, that voice, and that audience to advocate for the causes that she > believes in, like breaking world hunger with the UN. And someday, if given > the chance, I would like to be just like her. Thank you.\" She admitted in a subsequent interview that she was aiming to win the Miss Universe Philippines crown to strengthen emphasis and further her advocacy on social justice, particularly on the rights of prisoners but added, in conclusion, that she is very happy with the 2019 Binibining Pilipinas International title she now holds, and is looking forward to using her platform for the causes she believes in. ==References== ==External links== *Binibining Pilipinas Official Website Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:Miss International 2019 delegates Category:Binibining Pilipinas winners Category:People from Bataan Category:Filipino women lawyers Category:University of the Philippines Diliman alumni ",
