    "text": "The Gendarmerie nationale Togolaise (French for the Togolese National Gendarmerie) is a branch of the Togolese Armed Forces. Its 2,710 gendarmes protect people and property in rural areas, control roads and communications and contribute to provide assistance to the population in emergencies. == History == The Gendarmerie traces its origins to the establishment of the \"garde indig\u00e8ne\" (native guards) on 2 February 1915. On 28 June 1925, it became the \"compagnie de milice indig\u00e8ne\", later renamed the \"garde togolaise\". By 1933, it had become the \"service de police urbaine et rurale\". On 17 September 1942 Togolese troops were included in the foundation of the Gendarmerie de l\u2019Afrique Occidentale Fran\u00e7aise (AOF), the colonial gendarmerie. In 1963, the force was integrated into the armed forces and divided into two forces, the Gendarmerie territoriale, and the Gendarmerie mobile. In August 1965, the two were merged into the Gendarmerie nationale togolaise and remained in this form until 1995 when it was reorganized, and again in 2008. == Organisation == right The GNT is divided into central and regional bodies: * Central bodies (Organes centraux) are primarily located in Lom\u00e9. They include: ** The Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (Director-General's staff) ** Legions of the Gendarmerie Nationale (including 1 assigned to the capital). ** The Garde R\u00e9publicaine. ** The Groupement des formations sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es de la Gendarmerie (Specialist units) ** The Ecole Nationale de Gendarmerie (National Gendarmerie School) * Regional bodies (Organes r\u00e9gionaux) Since October 2014, the country is divided into two Gendarmerie regions, mirroring the military regions. The first region includes the Maritime and Plateaux regions. The second the Centrale, Kara and Savanes regions. Both Gendarmerie regions are in turn subdivided into five sectors. === The Togolese L\u00e9gion de gendarmerie (LG) === In Togo, the L\u00e9gion de Gendarmerie is a command structure. It includes all territorial and intervention units established in a collection of administrative regions. LGs are commanded by a senior officer, named by ministerial decree. === The Garde R\u00e9publicaine togolaise (GRT) === The Garde R\u00e9publicaine togolaise (Togolese Republican Guard) is a command unit of the GNT. Similar to the French Garde r\u00e9publicaine, the GRT provides protection to the Togolese Head of state and members of the government. === Contribution to Electoral Security === The Force de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Elections Pr\u00e9sidentielles (FOSEP) is a joint police-gendarmerie security force answerable to the electoral commission and under operational command of the ministry of defence. It was first established to provide security for the 2010 presidential elections. The Gendarmerie nationale contributed about 3000 of the first 6000 members of the FOSEP, as well as its commanding officer, a Gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel. For the 2015 elections the FOSEP was re-established, numbering about 8000 members. The UNDP has contributed to funding the training of the force. The Force s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9lection 2018 (FOSE) was stood up in August 2018 in preparation for the Togolese elections of December 2018. Headed by Mawuli T\u00eako Koudouwovoh, Director-General of the Togolese National Police, the force numbered about 8000 gendarmes and police officers. == Armament == With the exception of the Manurhin MR 73 revolver issued exclusively to the Garde R\u00e9publicaine and the Unit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9ciale d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie, Togolese Gendarmes are issued the same sidearms as the Togolese Land Forces. ==References== == Sources == * Official website of the Togolese Armed Forces Category:Military of Togo Category:Military units and formations established in 1965 ",
