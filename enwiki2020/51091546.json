It is Bley's first complete album of new compositions in eight years and is titled after a three part meditation on addiction and recovery, inspired by a friend's struggle with alcoholism.\"A friend of mine was going through addiction problems and it was a first-time experience for me to really witness that up close. When you're [sic] friend is boozing away it's a horrible, hopeless situation. Writing music can be a way to cheer yourself up.\" As quoted in \"Carla Bley's jazz journey\" by Jane Rocca, The Sydney Herald, May 24, 2017; accessed 17 July 2018 ==Reception== In The New York Times, Nate Chinen called the album \"Chamberlike and willowy, suffused with melancholy, it reflects her sly noncompliance with jazz and classical conventions, which has been a prevalent theme of her half-century career\".Chinen, N. Carla Bley, Still Improvising and Inspiring as She Turns 80, The New York Times\", May 10, 2016 Allmusic awarded the album 3\u00bd stars and said it was \"a delicately passionate, classically influenced set\" and that \"Ultimately, it's that shared intensity, born out of the trio's decades-long partnership, that makes Andando el Tiempo such an engaging listen\".

The Guardian Review, May 16, 2016 The All About Jazz review by John Kelman said it was \"an album of largely introspective music that shares much with its predecessor, but also acts as a flip side of the same coin\" and credited the producer stating \"Eicher's own ear for detail renders both Trios and Andando el Tiempo as more sonically open, with greater clarity across the layers produced by these three players...and the room in which they recorded, live, without any baffling or separation Kelman, J. Andando el Tiempo Review All About Jazz, May 6, 2016 Another review by Karl Ackerman stated \"the collection is as fine a small- group recording as Bley has produced in her career. While she has mastered all characteristics of musical narrative, here she has minimized the levity and occasional excesses in favor of warmth and class. It is a beautiful album\".Akerman, K. Andando el Tiempo Review All About Jazz, April 26, 2016 Bley's playing was noted by Cormac Larkin of The Irish Times who said \"it is Bley the pianist who seems particularly liberated by the different arrangement, and the playing \u2013 from a woman who once described herself as 1 per cent player, 99 per cent composer \u2013 is moving and starkly lyrical\".Irish Times Review, June 2, 2016 The Wall Street Journal 's Martin Johnson called the album \"'a showcase for Ms. Bley\u2019s intimate music, and it features superb, reserved performances in a trio setting featuring two longtime collaborators... their rapport is easy to hear; there are few unaccompanied solos, and most of the interplay sounds intuitive and spontaneous rather than composed... Unlike many pianists, Ms. Bley isn\u2019t a flamboyant soloist; instead her style pushes the music gently into new realms.\"Johnson, M. \u2018Andando el Tiempo\u2019 by Carla Bley Review: Big Force in a Small Group, Wall Street Journal, May 30, 2016 In JazzIz, Lean Crowley stated \"Her playing on Andando el Tiempo is, arguably, better than ever.
