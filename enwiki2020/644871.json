    "text": "Ismail (, ) is an Arabic given name. It corresponds to the English name Ishmael. ==Etymology and meaning== The literal translation of the name Ismail is \"heard by God\" and according to Abrahamic tradition, it refers to the yearning of Ibrahim and his wife, Sarah, to have a child. Ismail's mother, however, was not Sarah, but Hagar, Sarah's maidservant, who Sarah gave to Ibrahim as a concubine because she was unable to have a child. Sarah later does give birth to a son, Isaac. According to Genesis, the name is given by God as He heard the cries of Hagar who had been mistreated by Sarah after becoming pregnant and run away. According to Islamic tradition, but not Judaism or Christianity, Ismail's mother, Hagar was also a full wife of the Prophet Abraham. ==Given name== *Ismail, son of Ibrahim *Saint Ismael Orthodox Christian Saint *Ismail I (1487\u20131524), the founder of the Safavid dynasty *Ismail Abdul Rahman, Malaysian politician; former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia *Ismail Abu Shanab (1950\u20132003), Hamas politician *\u0130smail Acar (born 1971), Turkish painter *Ismail Akbay (1930\u20132003), Turkish scientist *Ismail Amat (1935\u20132018), Chinese politician *Ismail al-Armouti (died 2013), Jordanian politician *Esmail Babolian, Iranian numerical analyst *Ismail Balkhi (1918\u20131968), Afghan politician *Ismail bin Mail, Malaysian inventor of 2 for 1 ringgit *Isma'il Beg, Uyghur rebel leader *\u0130smail Be\u015fik\u00e7i, Turkish scholar *Esmail Davarfar, Iranian actor *\u0130smail Enver, Turkish military officer *Ismail Ebrahim (1946\u20132020), South African cricketer *Ismail Fahmi, Egyptian diplomat *\u0130smail G\u00fcld\u00fcren, Turkish footballer *Ismail Al Hammadi, Emirati footballer *Ismail Haniyeh, Palestinian politician *Ismail Hoxha, Albanian politician Professor Ph.D University \" La Sapienza\" Rome *Isma'il ibn Jafar, Imam of Ismaili Shia's *Ismail Kadare (born 1936), Albanian novelist, poet, essayist, and playwright *\u0130smail Kartal, Turkish footballer *\u0130smail Kele\u015f (born 1988), Turkish sport shooter *\u0130smail K\u00f6yba\u015f\u0131, Turkish footballer *Esmail Koushan, Iranian film director *Ismail Marzuki, Indonesian composer, songwriter, and musician *\u0130smail Ogan, Turkish sport wrestler *\u0130smail \u00d6zda\u011flar (born 1950), Turkish politician and former government minister *Isma'il Pasha (1830\u20131895), Wali and khedive of Egypt *Ismail Patel, British optician *Ismail Samani, Amir of the Samanids *Ismail Ibn Sharif, Moroccan sultan *Esmail Shooshtari, Iranian politician *Ismail Tiliwaldi, Chinese politician *\u0130smail T\u00fcr\u00fct, Turkish singer *Ismail Qemali, distinguished leader of the Albanian national movement *Esmail Zanjani, American academic *Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, Mexican drug lord ==Surname or patronymic== *Abdul Fattah Ismail (1934-1986), Yemeni politician *Atik Ismail (born 1957), Finnish footballer *Dhurgham Ismail, Iraqi football player *Gulalai Ismail, Pashtun women's rights activist *Haji Mohamed Yasin Ismail, Somali entrepreneur *Hamid Ismail, Qatari footballer *Hesham Ismail, American football player *Mohammed Ismail, Afghan Guantanamo Bay detainee *Mourad Ismail, Egyptian Mathematician *Mustafa Ismail, Egyptian Qur'an reciter *Mustafa Osman Ismail, Sudanese politician *Ibrahim Artan Ismail Somali politician, former Minister of Security of Puntland *Raghib \"Rocket\" Ismail, an NCAA and NFL football player *Qadry Ismail, an NCAA and NFL football player *Rami Ismail, Dutch Game Developer *Salma Ismail (1918\u20132014), Malaysian doctor *Sam Esmail, Egyptian-American screenwriter *Sariamin Ismail, Indonesian novelist *Shaker Ismail, Iraqi football player *Sulaiman Ismail, an Arena Football League player *Taufiq Ismail, Indonesian poet and activist *Usmar Ismail, director and pioneer of Indonesian film ==See also== *Sultan Ismail (disambiguation) *Ismail (disambiguation) Category:Arabic masculine given names Category:Iranian masculine given names Category:Bosniak masculine given names Category:Bosnian masculine given names Category:Turkish masculine given names Category:Arabic- language surnames Category:Albanian masculine given names ",
