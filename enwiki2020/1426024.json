He was the fourth child of Sim[c]ha Alter and Rivka Gutman. His father was a Hebrew writer and educator who wrote under the pen name S. Ben Zion. In 1903, the family moved to Odessa, and two years later, to Ottoman Palestine. In 1908, Gutman attended the Herzliya Gymnasium in what would later become Tel Aviv. In 1912, he studied at the Bezalel School in Jerusalem. In 1920\u201326, he studied art in Vienna, Berlin and Paris. Gutman was married to Dora, with whom he had a son. After Gutman's death in 1980, Dora asked two Tel Aviv gallery owners, Meir Stern of Stern Gallery and Miriam Tawin of Shulamit Gallery, to appraise the value all of the works left in his estate. ==Artistic career== Gutman's studio, Nahum Gutman Museum of Art Gutman helped pioneer a distinctively Israeli style, moving away from the European influences of his teachers. He worked in many different media: oils, watercolours, gouache and pen and ink. His sculptures and brightly colored mosaics can be seen in public places around Tel Aviv. Indoor murals depicting the history of Tel Aviv can be seen in the western wing of the Shalom Tower and the Chief Rabbinate building. A mosaic fountain with scenes from the early days of Tel Aviv and biblical stories connected to Jaffa (inscribed with 3 Bible verses: Jeremiah 31:4, 2 Chronicles 2:16, Jonah 1:3), stood for 32 years at the end of Bialik Street, opposite the old Tel Aviv municipality building.Mosaic Mural \u2013 Mosaic Artist \u2013 Nachum Gutman \u2013 Shalom Tower \u2013 Tel Aviv, Israel \u00ab Mosaic Art Source In 2012 this mosaic fountain was reinstalled at the southern end of Rothschild Boulevard.Haaretz: TA City Hall: Gutman Mosaic Destined for Ritzy Office Tower Courtyard, 11 June 2009 PhotoStock-israel, Oren Shalev (2015): \"The fountain is now located at the corner of Rothschild boulevard and Herzl street, Tel Aviv\" Gutman's artistic style was eclectic, ranging from figurative to abstract.
