    "text": "The Rivers State Internal Revenue Service (abbreviated RIRS) was formed in 1993 under the Board of Internal Revenue Law 1993 (No. 3). It is a government agency entrusted to assess, collect and account for all taxes, fees and levies in Rivers State, Nigeria. It is involved in the formulation of tax policy as well as the supervision of revenue collection due to the state. Its headquarters are at 22 William Jumbo Street in Old GRA, Port Harcourt. A new Board, led by a seasoned Accountant and Tax Expert, T. Adoage Norteh, was inaugurated on the 8th of February 2017, to boost the revenue of the state and reposition the Service. Mr. Adoage Norteh since assumption of office, has embarked on sweeping reforms to expand the tax net, as well as plug leakages. Some of the key reforms made include a restructuring of the personnel to boost efficiency, process review and optimization, and the launch of an innovative tax management system, RIVTAMIS, to automate the entire tax process of the state and engender transparency. Recently, the Board also launched a unified ticketing system for the Transport Sector, which has been hailed by all stakeholders. The new system, which is a first in the country, eliminates touting and multiple taxation, and plugs leakages through the use of scratch cards. In line with global best practices, the current Board deployed a Tax Management System, known as RIVTAMIS, to automate the Tax Process, and allow Tax Payers to carry out key tax functions. The RIVTAMIS Server went live in December 2017, but was formally launched by His Excellency, the Governor of Rivers State, in April 2018. RIVTAMIS, Rivers State Tax Management Information System, is an online platform that provides taxpayers and tax administrators a convenient and effective means of paying and managing taxes and tax information. It has been widely acclaimed in the industry by respected practitioners and taxpayers. RIVTAMIS provides the general tax-paying public the very rare opportunity to not only pay their taxes but to own their tax records and tax-related activities. Key features include convenience and ease, secured transactions, key functionalities such as online tax payment, e-filing of annual returns, requests for tax clearance, online receipting, online registration, etc. The reforms and innovation introduced by the Adoage Norteh led Board have produced remarkable results. Within this period, there has been an unprecedented increase in revenue. Records for both month-on-month and year-on-year revenue collection in the state has been broken, and new ones set. It is noteworthy to mention that the first half of the period under review, was during the biting period of recession, marked by economic hardship and loss of jobs. Also, within the period under review, there was an exponential enrollment in the tax net, by citizens. This was due to the steps taken to plug revenue nets by dismantling unnecessary roadblocks to the service, elimination of touting and unnecessary middlemen, the introduction of innovative collection systems, as well as robust tax education and stakeholder engagement. ==See also== *List of government agencies of Rivers State ==References== ==External links== * Category:Old GRA, Port Harcourt Category:Government agencies and parastatals of Rivers State Category:Regulation in Nigeria Category:Government agencies established in 1993 Category:Financial regulatory authorities Category:Revenue services Category:Taxation in Rivers State Category:1993 establishments in Nigeria Category:1990s establishments in Rivers State ",
