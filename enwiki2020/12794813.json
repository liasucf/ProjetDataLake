    "text": "Romanian Orthodox Church, Salamanca Russian Orthodox Church, Madrid Spain is not a traditionally Orthodox country, as after the Great Schism of 1054 Christians in the Iberian Peninsula remained in the Catholic sphere of influence. The number of Orthodox adherents in the country began to increase in the early 1990s, when Spain experienced an influx of migrant workers from Eastern Europe. The dominant nationality among Spanish Orthodox adherents is Romanian (as many as 0.7 million people), with Bulgarians, Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans, and others bringing the total to about 1 million. The territory is covered by the Metropolis of Spain and Portugal (Constantinople), Diocese of Madrid and Lisbon (Moscow PEWE), Diocese of Western Europe (Moscow- ROCOR), Diocese of Western and Central Europe (Bulgaria), Spanish Orthodox Church (Serbia), and the Metropolitanate of Western and Southern Europe (Romania). ==See also== *Religion in Spain *Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Western Europe *Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in Spain and Portugal (Moscow Patriarchate) == Literature == * ==External links== Canonical Churches: * Holy Metropolis of Spain and Portugal * * Iglesia Ortodoxa Espa\u00f1ola: Official page of Spanish Orthodox Church ",
