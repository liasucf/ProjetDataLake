THISDAY provides a rich content in demand by the business, economic, political and diplomatic elite; middle class professionals as well as aspirational millennials. THISDAY, named Newspaper of The Year, was the first Nigerian newspaper to print in colour at a time when most newspapers and the industry were in black and white around the world. It was also one of the first to go digital in Africa. THISDAY also creatively pioneered the idea of devoting the back page of the newspaper to informed commentaries from nationally acclaimed columnists as well as guest writers occasionally drawn from among the leading lights of public service and seasoned technocrats in the private sector. The Newspaper Company has hosted conferences, town hall meetings and global dialogues which have seen global leaders like Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Gerhard Schroder, John Howard, Collin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Dominique de Villepin amongst others, attending.
