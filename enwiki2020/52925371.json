    "text": "Forget (stylised as FORGET) is the tenth studio album by experimental band Xiu Xiu, released on February 24, 2017. Produced by John Congleton, Greg Saunier, and Angela Seo, it features contributions from Charlemagne Palestine, Kristof Hahn, Vaginal Davis, and Enyce Smith. == Background == The album cover bears Arabic calligraphy that translates to \"we forget\". Xiu Xiu leader Jamie Stewart has stated that the album cover has no meaning besides that \"it looks beautiful\" and is not meant as a political statement: \"in hoping to depoliticize it, I suppose that it becomes political.\" The title was further explained by Stewart: \u201cTo forget uncontrollably embraces the duality of human frailty. It is a rebirth in blanked out renewal but it also drowns and mutilates our attempt to hold on to what is dear.\u201d In a press release, the album was marketed as the band's \"most direct engagement with pop music\" ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77% based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Andrew Paschal of PopMatters gave the album 8 stars out of 10, calling it \"one of Xiu Xiu's poppiest and most accessible works to date\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Xiu Xiu * Jamie Stewart \u2013 vocals, guitar, modular synthesizer, organ, programming * Angela Seo \u2013 synthesizer, organ, percussion ;Additional personnel * Vaginal Davis \u2013 vocals * Kristof Hahn \u2013 guitar * Tanisha Hall \u2013 vocals * Devin Hoff \u2013 double bass * Chiara Lee \u2013 vocals * Charlemagne Palestine \u2013 carillon * Greg Saunier \u2013 bass guitar, percussion, guitar, synthesizer, vocals, organ * Enyce Smith \u2013 commentary * Federico Zanatta \u2013 vocals ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"| Chart !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"| US Vinyl Albums (Billboard) | 24 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 albums Category:Xiu Xiu albums Category:Polyvinyl Record Co. albums Category:Albums produced by John Congleton ",
