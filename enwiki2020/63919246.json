It was arranged by Jack \"Specs\" Nitzsche, and produced by Spector using his \"Wall of Sound\" production technique. \"I'll Never Need More Than This\" was released as a non- album track on Philles Records in May 1967. Due to the disappointing chart performance of the single \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" in the US, the album was only released on London Records in the UK. When River Deep \u2013 Mountain High was reissued in the US in 1969, \"I'll Never Need More Than This\" was included on the album. Tina Turner promoted the single on American Bandstand in 1967. It reached No. 114 on Bubbling Under The Hot 100 and No. 64 in the UK.
