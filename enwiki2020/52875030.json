SFIDA is an anti-establishment party that promotes direct democracy, mandate limitation and vetting for politicians. SFIDA is a follow-up of the movement \"Ne, Tirana\" which supported Gjergj Bojaxhi during local elections in 2015 where he ran as an independent candidate for Tirana's city hall. The party does not have a traditional leader. Instead this role is split between an administrative chairman (held by Hektor Ruci) and a political representative, Gjergj Bojaxhi. ==History== In June 2015, Bojaxhi ran as an independent candidate in the local elections for the city hall of Tirana. This candidacy was supported by an organized civil movement called \"Ne, Tirana\". The elections were won by Erion Veliaj, however Bojaxhi won over 16,000 votes. Based on this significant public support, in 2016 Bojaxhi and several other founders created \"SFIDA! p\u00ebr Shqip\u00ebrin\u00eb\" in order to extend \"Ne, Tirana\" to a national scale. SFIDA participated for the first time in the national general elections in June, 2017. ==Ideology== Sfida p\u00ebr Shqip\u00ebrin\u00eb is a centrist party. ==Parliamentary representation== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ National Assembly ! rowspan=2| Election ! rowspan=2| Leader ! colspan=2| Votes ! colspan=2| Seats ! rowspan=2| Role |- ! style=\"width:50px\"| # ! style=\"width:50px\"| % ! style=\"width:50px\"| # ! style=\"width:50px\"| \u00b1 |- ! 2017 | Hektor Ruci | 3,523 | 0.2 | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | new | |} ==Links== * sfidapershqiperine.com * sfida.org.al * Facebook page ==References== Category:2016 establishments in Albania Category:Political parties established in 2016 Category:Political parties in Albania ",
