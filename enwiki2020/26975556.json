    "text": "Ectoedemia albifasciella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is found in all of Europe except the Mediterranean Islands. In the east it ranges to the Volga and Ural regions of Russia. Ectoedemia albifasciella mine The wingspan is 5\u20136 mm. Adults are on wing in June. The larvae feed on Quercus petraea, Quercus pubescens, Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra and occasionally also on Castanea sativa. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a narrow corridor, with a broad frass line, running along a vein. The corridor runs away from the midrib most of the time, but might run along the midrib. The corridor widens abruptly into a blotch filled with frass. There are several mines in a single leaf most of the time. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. ==External links== *UKmoths *Ectoedemia albifasciella images at Consortium for the Barcode of Life *bladmineerders.nl *Ectoedemia albifasciella at Naturhistoriska riksmuseet *Nepticulidae from the Volga and Ural region Category:Nepticulidae Category:Moths of Europe ",
