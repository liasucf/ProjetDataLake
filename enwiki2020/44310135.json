The outlaw comes out of hiding and shoots the others and delivers Isabella to her destination. ==Cast== * Cohen Holloway as The Man * Inge Rademeyer as Isabella Montgomery * Jon Pheloung as The Sheriff * Toa Waaka as Native American Medicine Man ==Reception== Andy Webster of The New York Times called the movie \"a slender movie of humble, welcome charms\", and said first-time director Mike Wallis used the scenery of New Zealand to \"maximum advantage\". He pointed out that while the movie appears to promise romance, it is not \"predictable\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter said it was \"a promising first feature effort\" that was like \"a Kiwi spaghetti western filtered through the offbeat sensibilities of early Sam Raimi or the Coen brothers\". John Anderson from Variety said it has \"a tone so deadpan it becomes laugh-out-loud funny\" and it is \"a winning balance of humor and pluck\". He criticized its US release by saying that \"Proper positioning might have won the film a better theatrical shot, and perhaps even a cult following. But a robust afterlife should follow its limited opening.\" ==References== ==External links== * ==See also== * Cinema of New Zealand Category:2011 films ",
