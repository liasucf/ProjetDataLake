    "text": "The 1972 Iowa State Senate elections took place as part of the biennial 1972 United States elections. Iowa voters elected state senators in all of the state senate's 50 districts\u2014the 25 even-numbered seats were up for regularly- scheduled four-year terms and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the 1970 Census, the 25 odd-numbered seats were up for shortened two-year terms. State senators typically serve four-year terms in the Iowa State Senate, with half of the seats traditionally up for election each cycle. The decennial census and redistricting process causes one cycle each decade to be disrupted. The Iowa General Assembly provides statewide maps of each district. To compare the effect of the 1971 redistricting process on the location of each district, contrast the previous map with the map used for 1972 elections. The primary election on June 6, 1972 determined which candidates appeared on the November 7, 1972 general election ballot. The Iowa Secretary of State only provides the names of candidates who ran in the 1972 primaries and does not report vote tallies. The primary candidates' names can be obtained here. General election results can be obtained here. Following the previous election, Republicans had control of the Iowa state Senate with 38 seats to Democrats' 12 seats. In March 1971, a special election in district 11 resulted in G. William \"Bill\" Gross flipping a seat in favor of the Democrats. Therefore, on election day in November 1972, Republicans controlled 37 seats and Democrats had 13. To claim control of the chamber from Republicans, the Democrats needed to net 13 Senate seats. Republicans maintained control of the Iowa State Senate following the 1972 general election with the balance of power shifting to Republicans holding 28 seats and Democrats having 22 seats (a net gain of 9 seats for the Democrats). ==Summary of Results== *NOTE: The 25 even-numbered districts were up for four-year terms and the 25 odd-numbered districts were up for two-year terms due to the 1971 redistricting process. *Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\" ! class=\"unsortable\"| State Senate District ! class=\"unsortable\"|Incumbent ! colspan=\"2\"| Party ! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator ! colspan=\"2\"| Party |- | 1st | Lucas DeKoster | style=\"background:;\"| | Rep | Lucas DeKoster | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 2nd | Marvin Wesley Smith | style=\"background:;\"| | Rep | Irvin L.
