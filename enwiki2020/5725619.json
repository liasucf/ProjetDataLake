    "text": "\"Fade into You\" is a song by rock group Mazzy Star from their album So Tonight That I Might See. The song was written by lyricist Hope Sandoval and composer David Roback, who also served as producer. It reached number three on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1994 and is Mazzy Star's only single to make the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 44. The song also charted at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart and number three in Iceland. The group had two other songs make the Modern Rock Top 40 (\"Halah\" and \"Blue Flower\"), but they did not approach the success of \"Fade into You\". Pitchfork Media included the song at number 19 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s. Australian alternative music radio station Triple J ranked the song the 32nd greatest of 1994. ==Music videos== Two music videos were completed for \"Fade Into You.\" The first was directed by Kevin Kerslake and premiered on MTV in late October 1993, several weeks after the album's release. It features the band performing in front of a projection depicting white clouds in a black sky, and is interlaced with slow-motion footage of the band in various locales in the Mojave Desert. Portions of this video were filmed at the same location U2 shot the artwork for The Joshua Tree. A second music video was directed by Merlyn Rosenberg and first aired in February 1994. Known as the Black and White version for its monochromic content throughout, the intentionally grainy, distorted footage shows the band performing in a darkened Burlesque-era ballroom, and is interspersed with footage of Sandoval and Roback at various sites around San Francisco, including the All Seasons Hotel (now the Crescent Hotel) and neighboring Stockton Street tunnel, coupled with genuine footage of the same sites shot in the 1930s. Only the latter music video was broadcast internationally. ==Track listings== All songs written and composed by Hope Sandoval and David Roback, except where noted. * UK CD Single (7243 8-81534-2-3) # \"Fade into You\" \u2013 4:54 # \"Blue Flower\" \u2013 3:35 (Peter Blegvad/Anthony Moore) # \"I'm Gonna Bake My Biscuit\" \u2013 3:37 (Minnie McCoy) * Europe CD EP (7243 8-81448-2-7) / US CD (7243 8-58121-2-5) / AUS CD (8814482) # \"Fade into You\" \u2013 4:52 # \"I'm Gonna Bake My Biscuit\" \u2013 3:37 (McCoy) # \"Under My Car\" \u2013 3:35 # \"Bells Ring\" (acoustic version) \u2013 4:36 * US 12\" Vinyl (7243 8-81534-0-9) # \"Fade into You\" \u2013 4:52 # \"Five String Serenade\" (album version) \u2013 4:27 (Arthur Lee) # \"Under My Car\" \u2013 3:36 # \"Bells Ring\" (acoustic version) \u2013 4:35 * US Limited Edition EP (DPRO-79401) # \"Fade into You\" (Album Version) \u2013 4:53 # \"Into Dust\" (Live) \u2013 5:39 # \"Ride It On\" (Live) \u2013 2:59 # \"Ghost Highway\" (Live) \u2013 3:16 # \"Blue Light\" (Live) \u2013 5:09 # \"I'm Gonna Bake My Biscuit\" \u2013 3:37 (McCoy) # \"Under My Car\" \u2013 3:35 # \"Bells Ring\" (Acoustic Version) \u2013 4:36 # \"Fade Into You\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:16 :: Tracks 2\u20135 taken from a November 1, 1993 MTV Europe performance. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1994\u20131995) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |72 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |3 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1994) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |51 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s ballads Category:1994 singles Category:1994 songs Category:Mazzy Star songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Kevin Kerslake Category:Rock ballads ",
