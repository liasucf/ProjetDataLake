It was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020. The most common adverse reactions are flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. ==Pharmacology== Monomethyl fumarate alters the NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) transcription factor. NFE2L2 (or NRF2) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation. Several drugs that stimulate the NFE2L2 pathway are being studied for treatment of diseases that are caused by oxidative stress. Two precursors are also approved: * Dimethyl fumarate (brand name Tecfidera), * Diroximel fumarate (brand name Vumerity),Matthew Dodson et al., Modulating NRF2 in Disease: Timing Is Everything, Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Vol. 59, January 2019, Review in Advance first posted online on September 26, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010818-021856 approved by the FDA in October 2019. ==Names== Monomethyl fumarate is the international nonproprietary name (INN). == References == == External links == * Category:Multiple sclerosis ",
