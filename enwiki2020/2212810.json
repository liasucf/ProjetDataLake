Several species are named after him based on his specimens. == Biography == Dr. phil. h.c. Otmar Reiser (1861-1936) Reiser was born in Vienna, son of a well known lawyer, Otmar Reiser sr. whose namesake father was a well-known mayor of Maribor. He studied at the local gymnasium, at Novo Mesto (matriculating in 1882) and then joined as a reserve lieutenant in the 47th Infantry Regiment. He then went to the College of Agriculture in Vienna (graduating in 1887). He was involved in founding the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo and then joined its department of Natural History and worked there until retirement in 1919. He worked at the ornithological observatory at Ljubljana and studied Balkan birds. He also studied the birds of Sarajevo and contributed specimens to the Maribor Museum. He received a honorary doctorate from the University of Graz in 1932. His collections of eggs and bird skins were donated to the museum in Sarajevo. Reiser exhibited his collections at the 1891 International Ornithological Congress in Budapest, at the Millenium Exhibition, Budapest and at the international hunting exhibition in Vienna (1910). He took part in expeditions to Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Brazil, and Serbia. He also collected plants and was in charge of the herbarium after the death of the botanist Franz Fiala. In 1903 he took part in an expedition of the Austrian Academy of Sciences to north-east Brazil, during which he was the first to observe the Spix's macaw in the wild since its original discovery 84 years earlier. == Works == *Bericht \u00fcber die Besichtigungen des Spix-Aras bei Paranagu\u00e1 in Piau\u00ed w\u00e4hrend der Expedition der K.u.K Akademie der Wissenschaften im Jahre 1903 *Die VogelSammlung des bosnischhercegowin Landesmuseums in Sarajevo, Budapest (1891) *Bericht \u00fcber die botanische Ergebnisse meiner naturwissenschaftlichen Sammelreisen in Serbien in den Jahren 1899 u. 1900 (1905) *Materialen zu einer Ornis Balcanica Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien (1939) *Die V\u00f6gel von Marburg an der Drau.
