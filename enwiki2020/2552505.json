    "text": "Bute and Northern Ayrshire was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1983. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post voting system. ==History== The constituency was formed by combining Buteshire with part of North Ayrshire. The rest of Ayrshire North was merged into Kilmarnock. In 1918 the constituency consisted of \"The county of Bute, inclusive of all burghs, situated therein, and the county district of Northern Ayr, inclusive of all burghs situated therein except insofar as included in the Ayr District of Burghs\". In 1950 some of the constituency was transferred to the then new constituency of Central Ayrshire. In 1983 Bute and Northern Ayrshire was divided between Argyll and Bute and Cunninghame North. ==Boundaries== ==Members of Parliament== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1918 | Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston | Unionist |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1935 | Sir Charles MacAndrew | Unionist |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1959 | Sir Fitzroy Maclean | Unionist |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Feb 1974 | John Corrie | Conservative |- |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 1983 |colspan=\"2\"|constituency abolished: see Argyll and Bute & Cunninghame North |} ==Election results== ===Elections in the 1910s=== Hunter-Weston ===Elections in the 1920s=== ===Elections in the 1930s=== General Election 1939/40: Another General Election was required to take place before the end of 1940.
