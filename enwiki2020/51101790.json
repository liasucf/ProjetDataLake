    "text": "The 2016\u201317 season is Dumbarton's fifth consecutive season back in the second tier of Scottish football and their fourth season in the Scottish Championship, having won promotion via the play-offs from the Scottish Second Division at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. This is Stevie Aitken's second full season as manager. Dumbarton finished eighth in the Scottish Championship. Dumbarton did not advance beyond the group stage of the newly revamped League Cup, drawing 2 and losing 2 of the qualifying matches. In the Challenge Cup, Dumbarton's abysmal record in this competition continued (5 wins from 31 starts) with a third round exit to League One opponents, Stranraer. And it was a disastrous first hurdle exit to non-league junior side Bonnyrigg Rose in the third round of the Scottish Cup. ==Results & fixtures== ===Pre Season=== ===League Cup=== ===Challenge Cup=== ===Scottish Championship=== ===Scottish Cup=== ==Player statistics== === Squad === :Last updated 7 May 2017 |} ==Transfers== === Players in === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !From !Fee |- | Robert Thomson | Brechin City | Free |- | Andy Stirling | Stranraer | Free |- | Craig Pettigrew | Stranraer | Free |- | Ryan Stevenson | Ayr United | Free |- | David Smith | Falkirk | Free |- | Jamie Barclay | Stenhousemuir | Free |- | Josh Todd | Annan Athletic | Free |- | Daniel Harvie | Aberdeen | Loan |- | Alan Martin | Hamilton | Free |- | Joe Thomson | Celtic | Loan |- | Sam Stanton | Hibernian | Loan |- | Christian Nad\u00e9 | Stranraer | Free |- | Lewis Vaughan | Raith Rovers | Loan |- | Stuart Carswell | Keflavik | Free |- | Tom Lang | Rangers | Free |- | Calum Gallagher | St Mirren | Free |- | Ross McCrorie | Rangers | Loan |- | Joe Nuttall | Aberdeen | Loan |} === Players out === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !To !Fee |- | Kevin Cawley | Alloa Athletic |Free |- | Paul Heffernan | |Free |- | Mikey Hopkins | |Free |- | Jordan Kirkpatrick | Alloa Athletic |Free |- | Scott Taggart | Alloa Athletic |Free |- | Jon Routledge | New Saints |Free |- | Steven Saunders | New Saints |Free |- | Christian Nad\u00e9 | Stranraer |Free |- | Jamie Barclay | East Stirlingshire |Free |- | Ryan Clark | Kilwinning Rangers |Loan |- | Amadou Kassarat\u00e9 | Kirkintilloch Rob Roy |Loan |- | Ryan Stevenson | Raith Rovers | Free |- | Frazer Wright | Stirling Albion |Free |- | Craig Pettigrew | Stranraer |Free |- | Josh Todd | St Mirren | Free |- | Donald McCallum | Arbroath |Loan |- | Amadou Kassarat\u00e9 | Stranraer |Loan |- | Mark Brown | |Retired |} ==See also== *List of Dumbarton F.C. seasons ==References== Category:Dumbarton F.C. seasons Category:Scottish football clubs 2016\u201317 season ",
