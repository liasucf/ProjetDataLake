It wasn't until they met with Zimbabwean showman Teboho (Teboes) Maidza that the band began to grow seriously. Teboes is known to have played alongside Andy Brown and Oliver Mtukudzi. The band subsequently took on a three-piece brass section, in the form of The University of Cape Town's Simon Bates on saxophone, Jody Engelbrecht on trumpet and Ross McDonald on trombone. Dirk Meerkotter replaced Milandru Mapengo on keys. The band released its first CD, More Fire, in South Africa in October 2003, and the song \"Noh TV\" won a National Bronze Stone award for best music video in that same year.
