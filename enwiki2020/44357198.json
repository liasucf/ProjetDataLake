Rostrup B\u00f8yesen's art school (1933\u201339). He first exhibited at Kunstnernes Efter\u00e5rsudstilling in 1935. His early works were earthy-coloured figure paintings but he was more interested in French Modernism. After the Second World War, he spent lengthy periods in Paris until 1965, where he was attracted by Abstract art. Thanks to his friendship with Pierre Soulages and Jean Bazaine, he developed a style of dark arabesques on a light background. Andersen's first major work in Denmark was Abstract decoration in the Central Library on Kultorvet (1959) which caused considerable discussion but there was more solid appreciation of his later assignments, including the Bochum Museum of Art (1981) and Sejs-Svejb\u00e6k Church near Silkeborg (1990). ==Awards== In 1949, Andersen was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1984, the Thorvaldsen Medal. ==References== ==Literature== ==External links== *Illustrated list of Mogens Andersen's works in Danish museums Category:1916 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish ceramists Category:Danish illustrators Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:20th-century ceramists ",
