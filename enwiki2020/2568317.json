It premiered as a special on August 19, 1972, then began its run as a regular series on February 2, 1973; its last episode was on May 1, 1981.Promotional site for the DVD re-issue The 90-minute program followed the Friday night edition of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Like its syndicated late- night cousin Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, the show typically featured guest hosts, except for a period from July 1975 through March 1976 when singer Helen Reddy served as the regular host. Wolfman Jack served as the announcer and frequent guest host. The program's theme song, a traditional folk song called \"Midnight Special\", was performed by Johnny Rivers. The Midnight Special was noted for featuring musical acts performing live, which was unusual since most television appearances during the era showed performers lip-synching to prerecorded music. The series also occasionally aired vintage footage of older acts, such as Bill Haley & His Comets. The program also featured occasional performances of comedians such as Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, and George Carlin. ==History== In 1972, producer Burt Sugarman pitched the program as a means for NBC to capitalize on The Tonight Shows large audience. At the time, none of the Big Three television networks had programming on after 1:00 am local time, as common practice by most stations was to sign-off after the final program. Despite this lack of competition in the time-slot, NBC initially rejected the idea. The rejection led Sugarman to buy the air time for the premiere on his own as a brokered show, convincing Chevrolet to become the show's first sponsor. It premiered with ratings high enough for NBC to reconsider its decision, and the network subsequently bought the program. NBC reasoned that the additional weekly hour of programming would allow NBC to recoup revenue lost as a result of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the advertising of tobacco on television.Tom Snyder on Later, 1994 The program remained a part of NBC's late night lineup until 1981. The pilot for the series aired on August 19, 1972. It was presented as a 90-minute special encouraging young people to vote in the upcoming Presidential election. Several months later, on February 2, 1973, it premiered as a weekly series. Within eight months of its premiere, The Midnight Special had proven that programming in the later time period was viable, and NBC would expand its programming in the time slot to five days a week with the addition of the talk show Tomorrow the other four nights. The Midnight Specials original time slot was from 1:00-2:30 am in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (Midnight to 1:30 am Central and Mountain). When The Tonight Show's run time was shortened from ninety to sixty minutes in September, 1980 The Midnight Special was moved to 12:30 am (ET/PT)/11:30 pm (CT/MT), maintaining its ninety minute run time. In 1978, at the height of the disco craze, the set was changed to resemble a disco nightclub complete with a platform dance floor. Wolfman Jack stood behind an elevated DJ booth. By fall 1979, as the genre's popularity waned, the disco set was gone. ==Guest stars== Some notable guest stars and hosts included: *ABBA *AC/DC *Aerosmith *America *Aretha Franklin *New Birth *The Bay City Rollers *The Beach Boys *The Bee Gees *Chuck Berry *Blondie *David Bowie *Dr. Hook *Bread *Brooklyn Dreams *James Brown *The Cars *The Chambers Brothers *Jerry Bell *Ray Charles *Cheap Trick *Lou Christie *Petula Clark *Jim Croce *Billy Crystal *Bo Diddley *The Doobie Brothers *Earth, Wind & Fire *Electric Light Orchestra *Mama Cass Elliot *Fleetwood Mac *Peter Frampton *Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons *Aretha Franklin *Marvin Gaye *Genesis *Andy Gibb *Gladys Knight & The Pips *Golden Earring *Goldstar *Al Green *The Guess Who *Heart *Janis Ian *Wolfman Jack *The Jackson 5 *Rick James *Billy Joel *Elton John *Journey *KC and the Sunshine Band *Andy Kaufman *B.B.
