Due to excessive maintenance costs and the relatively few users of the station, it was removed. * A different train approach melody was used on the station, playing a sound similar to that of an ocean wave. On March 27, 2007, the melody was changed to the standard approach melody that is used on the metro. ==Layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|1F |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 valign=top|Exit/Entrance |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|B1F |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|One-way faregates, ticket/ICOCA/PiTaPa machines, station agent |- |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=3 valign=top|B2F |Platform 3 |\u2190 Nank\u014d Port Town Line toward Nakafuto and Suminoek\u014den (Trade Center-mae) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left/right |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform 4 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 Nank\u014d Port Town Line toward for Nakafuto and Suminoek\u014den (Trade Center-mae) |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=3 valign=top|B3F |Platform 1 |\u2192 Ch\u016b\u014d Line toward Hommachi, Tanimachi Yonchome, Morinomiya, Nagata, Ikoma, and Gakken Nara-Tomigaoka (Osakako) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform 2 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| \u2190 Ch\u016b\u014d Line termination platform |} ==Stations next to Cosmosquare== |- !colspan=5|Osaka Metro ==External links== * Cosmosquare Station Category:Railway stations in Osaka Prefecture Category:Osaka Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1997 ",
