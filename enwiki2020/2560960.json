He attacked the Miraflores cabinet in 1864, and became under-secretary of the home office when C\u00e1novas was minister in 1865. He was made a councillor of state in 1866, and in 1868 assisted the other members of the Uni\u00f3n Liberal in preparing the revolution. In the Cortes of 1872 he took much part in financial debates. He accepted office as member of the last Sagasta cabinet under King Amadeus. On the proclamation of the republic Elduayen very earnestly co-operated in the Alphonsist conspiracy, and endeavoured to induce the military and politicians to work together. He went abroad to meet and accompany the prince after the pronunciamiento of Marshal Campos, landed with him at Valencia, was made governor of Madrid, a marquis, grand cross of Charles III, and minister for the colonies in 1878. He accepted the portfolio of foreign affairs in the C\u00e1novas cabinet from 1883 to 1885, and was made a life senator. He always prided himself on having been one of the five members of the Cortes of 1870 who voted for Alfonso XII when that parliament elected Amadeus of Savoy. He died at Madrid on the 24 June 1898. ==External links== * |- |- |- Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:Economy and finance ministers of Spain Category:Foreign ministers of Spain Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:1823 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Conservative Party (Spain) politicians Category:Members of the Senate of Spain Category:Governors of the Bank of Spain Category:Civil governors of Madrid Category:Presidents of the Senate of Spain ",
