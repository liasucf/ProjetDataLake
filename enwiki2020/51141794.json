    "text": "The 1972\u201373 San Diego Conquistadors season was the 1st season of the San Diego Conquistadors in the American Basketball Association. The Conquistadors were the first and only expansion team of the ABA, made to make the league have 10 teams, with Dr. Leonard Bloom granted a team for $1 million. But a feud with Peter Graham, proprietor of the San Diego Sports Arena due to Graham being bitter for not being granted the team meant that the team would play their games in the 3,200 capacity Peterson Gym. The first game was a Friday night on October 13, 1972 versus the Denver Rockets, which they lost 100\u2013109. The Conquistadors had a 16\u201326 first half of the season, with a ten-game losing streak in that half. In the second half, they went 21\u201321, with a nine-game losing streak in there, though they have a five-game winning streak near the end of the season that rose their win total from 25 to 30. The Q's managed to get into the playoffs due to the Dallas Chaparrals losing to the Denver Rockets on March 25. They finished 9th in points scored with 109.0 points per game and 7th in points allowed with 113.2 points per game. They faced off against the Utah Stars in the playoffs, but they were swept in four games.https://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/SDA/1973.htmlhttps://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/SDA/1973_games.html ==Roster== *12 George Adams \u2013 Small forward *14 Henry Bacon \u2013 Shooting guard *20 Mike Barrett \u2013 Shooting guard *40 Jerry Chambers \u2013 Small forward *54 Simmie Hill \u2013 Small forward *13 Stew Johnson \u2013 Power forward *44 Larry Miller \u2013 Shooting guard *55 Gene Moore \u2013 Center *52 Craig Raymond \u2013 Center *21 Red Robbins \u2013 Center *33/42 Garfield Smith \u2013 Center *53 Pete Smith \u2013 Power forward *22 Oliver Taylor \u2013 Shooting guard *23 Chuck Williams \u2013 Point guard ==Final standings== ===Western Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
