    "text": "Duckbill was a sandstone hoodoo rock formation at Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The formation served as a tourist attraction along the Oregon Coast and was photographed frequently prior to being toppled by a group of teenage vandals on August 29, 2016. The group of vandals who toppled the popular landmark asserted that they did so to eliminate a safety hazard because a friend of theirs had broken a leg on the rock formation, apparently thinking that they thus did a public service. Chris Havel, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department associate director, however, noted that the formation was fenced-off and signs warned visitors against approaching it: \"The fence is very clear; you have to intentionally move the wires aside and crawl through it.\" The vandals have not been caught. ==References== ==External link== * Category:2016 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Defunct tourist attractions in the United States Category:Destroyed landmarks in Oregon Category:Erosion landforms Category:Oregon Coast Category:Rock formations of Oregon Category:Sandstone formations of the United States Category:Tillamook County, Oregon Category:Tourist attractions in Oregon Category:Vandalism ",
