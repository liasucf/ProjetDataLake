    "text": "\"I'll Be There\" is a song by the band CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers. It was produced by Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. It was intended to be the lead single for the band's album It's About Time, but due to the deaths of Prince and David Bowie, the album changed over the following years. Since Rodgers is the act's founder and only original member, he received billing credit on the song. ==Song background== The single pays tribute to the disco era and makes references to Chic-related songs and artists produced by the group. Among the referenced tracks (and acts) mentioned and sampled: *\"Got To Love Somebody\" by Sister Sledge (using the song's multiple elements) *\"Everybody Dance\" (sampled vocal lyrics) *\"Good Times\" (sampled vocal lyrics) *\"We Are Family\" by Sister Sledge (Sound effects from the extended version) ==Chart performance== The song reached number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart in its June 20, 2015 issue, and was the act's fourth number one overall, and their first number-one single in nearly 23 years when \"Chic Mystique\" peaked at number one, in 1992. === Chart positions === {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium Dance (Ultratop Flanders) | 27 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium Dance Bubbling Under (Ultratop Wallonia) | 11 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Japan (ZIP Dance Hits 20) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |- |} ==See also== * List of number-one dance singles of 2015 (U.S.) ==References== ==External links== *Official Video (US version) on YouTube Category:2015 singles Category:Chic (band) songs Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number- one singles Category:Number-one singles in Israel Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Electronic songs Category:House music songs Category:2014 songs Category:Songs written by Nile Rodgers Category:Songs written by Bernard Edwards Category:Warner Records singles ",
