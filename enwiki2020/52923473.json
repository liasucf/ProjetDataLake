    "text": "Micro Machines World Series is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Micro Machines World Series received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, partially due to its lack of career mode and spotty online multiplayer. Hardcore Gamer awarded it a positive score of 4 out of 5, saying \"Micro Machines World Series\" is a great buy for anyone who enjoyed prior entries in the series or simply wants a great racing game that the whole family can enjoy.\" PlayStation LifeStyle awarded it a more negative score of 4.5 out of 10, saying \"This could get fixed into a solid game, but players should be cautious until an overhaul occurs. Hobby Consoles said that the \"12 player online mode is not enough to compensate the absence of a career mode, the technical failures and some online design problems (such as the lobby system and menus).\" ===Sales=== It debuted at number 2 on the UK all format video games sales charts. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Micro Machines (video game series) Category:2017 video games Category:Codemasters games Category:Linux games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ",
