This involved using hatch rates, chick survival rates, and the mass of chicks to predict how birds and breeding success might be impacted by changes in the marine environment. She worked as a biodiversity ranger for the Department of Conservation for a number of years. Her work involved monitoring and managing yellow-eyed penguin populations in the Otago region.Mel is currently completing a doctorate at the University of Otago. This involves using satellite trackers to map the foraging behaviors at sea of yellow-eyed penguins. == References == Category:Conservation biologists Category:New Zealand women scientists Category:University of Otago alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
