    "text": "Andr\u00e9s de San Mart\u00edn (b. Seville - d. Cebu, 1521) was the chief pilot- cosmographer (astrologer) of the Armada del Maluco, the fleet commanded by Ferdinand Magellan in 1519. He is presumed to have died during that expedition in Cebu. == Family == His nationality has been variously identified as Portuguese or French but archival records published in 1997 show San Mart\u00edn was born in Seville. He was the son of Juan de Logro\u00f1o and Juana Hern\u00e1ndez. He had at least one brother, Crist\u00f3bal de San Mart\u00edn, who was his heir. Andr\u00e9s de San Mart\u00edn had two daughters, Juana and Mar\u00eda, with his partner Ana Mart\u00edn, whom he never married. == Exceptional pilot of the Renaissance == Little is known of San Mart\u00edn's life before 1512, when King Ferdinand commissioned him royal pilot. His knowledge of cosmography (astrology) was singular. He knew more than others during the Age of Discovery how astronomical science could be applied to navigation. Confident of his unique skills he applied for the post of pilot major of Spain upon the death in 1512 of its holder, Amerigo Vespucci. He was turned down by the King who appointed instead Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds. He again applied for the post in 1518 when Sol\u00eds died. Again he was turned down in favor of another foreigner, Sebastian Cabot. Nevertheless, the King consoled San Mart\u00edn by raising his pay to 10,000 maravedis. San Mart\u00edn replaced Rui Faleiro as cosmographer/astrologer on Magellan's expedition to the Spice Islands. Magellan and his Portuguese countryman Faleiro had planned the expedition together, but when the latter developed mental problems the king removed him from the enterprise. San Mart\u00edn reported for duty upon order of the King sometime in July 1519. He received advances on July 31, 1519 of 30,000 maravedis and 7,500 maravedis for cost-of-living allowance. At Rio de Janeiro, San Mart\u00edn left the ship San Antonio and transferred to Victoria. He was suspected of being involved in the failed mutiny attempt in April 1520 in Port St. Julian and was tortured by strappado, but afterwards was allowed to continue his service as cosmographer. San Mart\u00edn was presumed death at Cebu on May 1, 1521. There is no certainty he was one of those killed there. There were reliable reports later that some eight survived the massacre. == Measurement of longitude == Andr\u00e9s de San Mart\u00edn, according to Tim Joyner, was the most eminent cosmographer in the fleet. Twice, he was able to calculate accurately, using astronomical measurement, the longitudes of two places, Port San Julian at Patagonia and Homonhon Island in the Philippines. At San Julian, he brought out his instruments, to quote Tim Joyner, \"to test Faleiro's system for using conjunctions of the moon with the planets to determine longitude. His measurements resulted in the astonishingly accurate estimate of 61\u00b0 west of Seville. Less than one degree in error, this was an accomplishment far beyond the capabilities of the other pilots.\" Again, at Homonhon Island, in central Philippines, he was able to measure its longitude, according to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas. Laguarda asserts that the reading of 189\u00b0 longitude \"from the meridian\" which meant the line of demarcation at 47\u00b0 west of Greenwich. In today's system of reckoning Homonhon Is. is at 125\u00b0 42.8' east longitude. This reading is only two degrees in error, Laguarda asserts. No other had shown such mathematical skill. Indeed, for two hundred years his calculations were not matched by anyone. == San Mart\u00edn's papers == San Mart\u00edn entrusted his priceless navigational notes and other papers to Gin\u00e9s de Mafra sometime before May 1, 1521. These were confiscated when de Mafra together with co-prisoners G\u00f3mez de Espinosa and Hans Bergen reached Lisbon in July 1526. This lengthy possession by de Mafra of San Mart\u00edn's papers has led to the belief voiced by geographer Donald D. Brand and embraced by Magellan historiographer Martin Torodash, who is cited by Philippine religious historian John Schummacher, S.J., for Brand's dictum, that the eyewitness account of Gin\u00e9s de Mafra is nothing more than his recall of what he read from San Mart\u00edn's papers. This has led to historians overall disregarding the testimony of de Mafra which has overarching importance in Age of Discovery geography of the Philippine region. In fact, because de Mafra's observations may reflect as well the genius of San Mart\u00edn, his testimony becomes doubly important. De Mafra's account, more precisely, is critical and indispensable in solving the Mazaua landfall issue which is also known in the Philippines as the 'First mass in the Philippines' controversy. San Mart\u00edn's papers were kept at a Lisbon archive where these were consulted by Portuguese historians like Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda, Gaspar Corr\u00eaa, Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is, Jo\u00e3o de Barros, and others. San Mart\u00edn's papers were later transferred to Madrid during the union of the Iberian kingdoms, 1580-1640. Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, as asserted by J. Denuc\u00e9, extensively used San Mart\u00edn's insights. One of the key observations of the astrologer pertaining the March\u2013April 1521 incident at the island-port of Mazaua remained the sole faithful published account throughout the 16th century until the 19th century with the exact name of the island. Other accounts had either \"Messana\" or \"Massana\" as the island's name. These two names were first used by Maximilianus Transylvanus in his report of the circumnavigation contained in a letter to Cardinal Matth\u00e4us Lang, the archbishop of Salzburg. Transylvanus' report was published and became an overnight sensation in Europe. San Mart\u00edn's papers unfortunately got lost and are nowhere to be found. They exist in the various quotes by contemporary Portuguese historians and later Spanish historians like Herrera. == References == ;Bibliography *BARROS, Jo\u00e3o. 1552-1563. Decadas da Asia.
