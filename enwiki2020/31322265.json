    "text": "Herrenberg station is located on the G\u00e4u Railway () and is at the start of the Ammer Valley Railway (Ammertalbahn). Because it is a stop for Regional-Express services and it is a terminus for both Stuttgart S-Bahn line S 1 and Regionalbahn services from T\u00fcbingen and Bondorf, it is an important transport node. It is located about 200 metres west of the old centre of Herrenberg in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. == History == In the mid 19th century the citizens of Oberamt Herrenberg (one of the former districts of Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg, that were replaced in 1934 by Landkreise) were mostly engaged in agriculture. The most profitable seems to have been the cultivation of sugar beet and hops. In the 1860s, Herrenberg sought a connection to the rail network so that and the district could have access to night soil from the latrines of Stuttgart as cheap fertilizer in order to grow produce for supply to the B\u00f6blingen sugar beet factory and the breweries. The cities of B\u00f6blingen and Freudenstadt also participated in the campaign. But because of the difficult geographical conditions, the parliament of W\u00fcrttemberg voted not to require the Royal W\u00fcrttemberg State Railways to build the connection sought from Stuttgart via the western Filder plain and the Korng\u00e4u district of the northern Black Forest. Only in November 1873 was construction authorised for the railway line, now called the G\u00e4ubahn. On 2 September 1879, the State Railways opened the line. Herrenberg station had the still preserved three- story reception building and the now demolished freight shed. In that year, the trip from Stuttgart to Herrenberg took one hour and 22 minutes. In the 1880s, the freight facilities had to be expanded. Funding of this work involved the city of Herrenberg and the surrounding communities of Kuppingen, Oberjettingen, Unterjettingen and Affst\u00e4tt, whose inhabitants still hoped to have their own stations. The railways\u2019 planners foresaw the beginning of a connection from the G\u00e4u Railway to T\u00fcbingen. B\u00f6blingen campaigned for this line to run from B\u00f6blingen, but in 1900 it was decided that the line would run from Herrenberg to the Upper Neckar Railway. The line through the valley of the Ammer was less complicated and costly than the line through the Sch\u00f6nbuch. At that time, were also plans for a line from Herrenberg to Calw, Althengstett or Wildberg. Two routes were considered to Wildberg but were rejected because such a line would have competed with the Nagold Valley Railway. Enlargement of the station was necessary for the Ammer Valley Railway. As a new junction, it received several new tracks, a signal box, a locomotive shed with a turntable and a water tower. The Ammer Valley Railway was opened on 12 August 1909 as far as Pf\u00e4ffinger and on 1 May 1910 to T\u00fcbingen. On 25 September 1966, Deutsche Bundesbahn passenger services were abandoned between Herrenberg and Entringen and the line was closed between Herrenberg and G\u00fcltstein in 1973. On 6 December 1992, the station was connected to the Stuttgart S-Bahn network with extension of line S 1, which had earlier ended in B\u00f6blingen. After the Zweckverband \u00d6PNV im Ammertal (Ammer Valley public transport association) acquired the Ammer Valley Railway from Deutsche Bahn in 1996, the restoration of the line could be started. Since 1 August 1999, trains are again running between Herrenberg and T\u00fcbingen. == Operations == Herrenberg station is a railway junction on the G\u00e4u Railway, from which the Ammer Valley Railway branches off. Platform track 1 is assigned to Regional-Express services towards B\u00f6blingen. Track 2 is used for the start and end on S-Bahn services. Track 3 is used by terminating S-Bahn services, before they are parked in the rear track field. Regional-Express trains to Eutingen im G\u00e4u stop on track 4. Tracks 101 and 102 are terminating tracks, on which Regionalbahn services start to T\u00fcbingen and Bondorf. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station. ===Regional Transport=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Route!! Frequency !!
