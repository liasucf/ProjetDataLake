Accessed on 18 Dec 2011. is a long peninsula in the coastal district of Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen, in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The three parts of the peninsula, from west to east, are Fischland (part of Mecklenburg), Dar\u00df and Zingst (part of Pomerania). There are six villages on the peninsula - Wustrow, Ahrenshoop, Born, Wieck, Prerow and Zingst. Between the peninsula and the mainland there is a very shallow lagoon (Low German: bodden), the Saaler Bodden, which is part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park, together with the peninsula. == History == In historical times, the main part of Fischland as well as the Dar\u00df and the Zingst were islands. They became permanently joined to the mainland as a result of humans sealing the floodwater channels between the 14th and 19th centuries. During the 1872 Baltic Sea flood, which inundated Prerow on the Dar\u00df, the Prerower Strom, that had hitherto separated the island of Zingst from Dar\u00df, silted up. In 1874 the Prerow-Strom was finally filled in and sealed with a dyke; Zingst thus became a peninsula. The eastern part of the Zingst peninsula and the middle of the Dar\u00df are part of the West Pomeranian Lagoon Area National Park.
