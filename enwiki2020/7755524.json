    "text": "Booze is a hamlet in Arkengarthdale, in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England. It is about east of Langthwaite and Arkle Town. There is a riding school nearby. The original community depended on hill farming and mining. The hamlet overlooks Slei Gill which contains several lead mining levels. Following the collapse of the lead mining industry in North Yorkshire at the end of the 19th century one of the mines, the Booze Wood Level, continued to be used as a slate mine until the beginning of the First World War. Chert was mined on Fremington Edge, south of Booze, until the beginning of the Second World War.Hardy, John (No date, post 1982) The Hidden Side of Swaledale. The Life and Death of a Yorkshire Lead Mining Community. Frank Peters, Kendal. . Pages 74, 75. The 1851 census counted 41 houses in Booze.Batty, Margaret (1982) A View of Akengarthdale. Teesdale Mercury Press. pp 14. A local tragedy occurred during the eighteenth century when a group of miners working underground near Boldershaw blasted into an underground lake. Twenty-four miners and two pit ponies were drowned in the flood that followed. Eighteen of the dead came from Booze. The vein became known as the Water Blast Vein.Hardy. Page 42. In July 2008, Royal Mail announced it was withdrawing postal services from the hamlet on health and safety grounds because access to it involves an \"excessively steep\" rural track. This has left local families to make a one-hour round-trip into Richmond and back to collect their mail. Postal services to the hamlet were restored after North Yorkshire County Council made road improvements. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hamlets in North Yorkshire Category:Arkengarthdale ",
