List of foreign consulates in Spain. == Historical relations == \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a, the Spanish explorer who explored the Solomon Islands and attempted colonization on behalf of the Spanish Crown, but failed after his death In 1567 he left El Callao an expedition commanded by \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a, taking Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa as captains of the ships and Pedro de Ortega in search of Terra Australis Incognita and study the possibilities of colonization and exploitation of its resources. On 7 February 1568 the two ships of the expedition, Los Reyes and Todos los Santos arrived at the first of the islands of the archipelago. The island was baptized with the name of Santa Isabel. For six months they explored Palm Island (Malaita), San Jorge (south of Santa Isabel), Florecida, Galera, Buenavista, San Dimas, and Guadalupe (group of islands Florida or Nggela Sule ), Guadalcanal, Sesarga (Savo), San Nicol\u00e1s Islands, San Jer\u00f3nimo and Arrecifes (group New Georgia ), San Marcos (Choiseul), San Crist\u00f3bal (Makira), Treguada (Ulawa), Tres Mar\u00edas (Olu Malua), San Juan ( Uki Ni Masi), San Urb\u00e1n (Rennell), Santa Catalina and Santa Ana. \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a tried to prepare a second expedition to Solomon to colonize them and prevent them from serving as a refuge for pirates English who attacked the Spanish ships that traded with the Philippines . It was the viceroy of Peru, Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, who authorized and sponsored the expedition, contributing military personnel, while Menda\u00f1a himself convinced merchants and settlers to participate in the company. The ships left El Callao in 1595 and after discovering the Marquesas Islands, named in honor of the viceroy and marquis of Ca\u00f1ete, and passing through the Cook Islands and Tuvalu, they arrived at Santa Cruz Islands, south of Solomon. The ship Santa Ysabel was lost on the island of Tinakula, however they came to found a colony, called Puerto de Santa Cruz, in the Santa Cruz Islands, in the current province of Temotu. Soon, Menda\u00f1a became ill with malaria and the settlers came into conflict with the natives. On 18 October 1595 Menda\u00f1a died on the island of Nend\u00f6 and his wife, Isabel de Barreto, took over the colony. After these events, they decided to leave the islands and go to Manila. After these expeditions the Spaniards lost interest in the islands, although they continued to visit them during the 17th century. There was a new colonizing attempt in 1606, led by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quir\u00f3s, who recast the Menda\u00f1a colony, but abandoned it with the intention of discovering and exploring Australia, in which he was unsuccessful. The islands were subsequently visited by British, French and Dutch. == Diplomatic relations == Spain established diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands on 8 August 1980, but that country does not have a resident embassy, which is under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Embassy in Canberra and whose consular affairs are managed from the Spanish consulate general in Sydney.Ficha de las Islas Salom\u00f3n Office of Diplomatic Information.
