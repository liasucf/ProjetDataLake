    "text": "{| |} USS Mistletoe (1861) was a steamer purchased by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was planned by the Union Navy for use as a tugboat whose task it was to tow other ships or to free them when they became stuck or otherwise inoperable. Mistletoe, a small steam tug, was built as Restless at St. Louis, Missouri, in 1861; purchased by the U.S. War Department early in the Civil War for service in the Western Flotilla and renamed; transferred to the Navy at Cairo, Illinois, 30 September 1862; and commissioned 1 October 1862, Acting Ens. James L. Quigley in command. Mistletoe served as a tug at the Cairo Naval Base until joining the Mississippi Squadron downriver 7 September 1863. After the end of the Civil War, she was sold at public auction at Mound City, Illinois, to S. Horner 20 November 1864. She was redocumented as Ella Wood 6 February 1866 and remained in merchant service until 1871. == See also == *United States Navy *American Civil War == References == Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Tugs of the United States Navy Category:Steamships of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in St. Louis Category:American Civil War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:1861 ships ",
