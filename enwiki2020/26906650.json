The Hospital de las Cinco Llagas (literally \"Hospital of the Five Holy Wounds\") in Seville, Spain is the current seat of the Parliament of Andalusia. ==History== Construction of the building began in 1546, as a legacy of Don Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Ribera, who had died in 1539. It was designed by Mart\u00edn de Gainza, who directed the construction until his death in 1556. Two years later, Hern\u00e1n Ruiz II took over the works, and the building was inaugurated, although still incomplete, in 1558. The building is on a rectangular plan, originally intended to be built around 10 courtyards, of which only nine were constructed and only eight survive as of the early 21st century. The most distinctive element of the building is its church, situated in the central courtyard of the left side. It is built on a Latin cross plan and is broadly in the style of the Spanish Renaissance. Its distinguished main altarpiece was designed by Diego L\u00f3pez Bueno with paintings by Alonso V\u00e1zquez based on designs by Asensio de Maeda. The church is taller than the rest of the building. Its interior is now the site of the plenary sessions of the Andalusian parliament. The building functioned as a hospital until 1972. After being abandoned for several years, in 1986 plans were drawn up to convert it to the seat of the parliament of the autonomous community of Andalusia. It was inaugurated 28 February 1992, the (D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda), with restoration work still in progress. The restoration was completed in 2003, with the conclusion of the work on those courtyards and rooms not restored in the 1980s.Sede del Parlamento de Andaluc\u00eda parlamentodeandalucia.es [13-10-2008] == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Seville Category:Parliament of Andalusia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1558 Category:Hospital buildings completed in the 17th century Category:Renaissance architecture in Spain Category:Defunct hospitals in Spain Category:Seats of Spanish regional legislatures ",
