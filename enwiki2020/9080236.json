    "text": "Grundy's Wonders is a Tyne Tees Television architecture programme presented by John Grundy, which began in 2000. On the programme, Grundy explores buildings in north-east England, as well as Cumbria and Yorkshire. Each programme has a particular theme or type of building, and Grundy names his favourite piece of architecture (on the week's theme) his \"Grundy's Wonder\", and gives a \"Big Boot\" to things he dislikes. Grundy presents the programme in an enthusiastic way, while covering many aspects of the northern English region's history; this is also one of few architecture series on television. ==Episodes and places visited== ===Series 5=== *Episode 1: \"Rock\" (26 October 2004) Featured the North Bar gateway, Beverley; Burton Agnes Hall; River Glen bridge at Ewart (near Wooler), Northumberland; Swarland Brickworks library (betw.
