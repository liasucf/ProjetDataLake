While she is successful in getting Aditya freed from charge of a rape, she fails to acquit him form the murder charge. His lawyer Nikhat Hussain (Anupriya Goenka) along with Madhav Mishra (Pankaj Tripathi), also tries to save him. While Aditya gets life imprisonment for the murder of Sanaya, Madhav Mishra still believes that Aditya is innocent. He figures out from Sanaya's Instagram account that Sanaya worked at a drug rehabilitation center, getting treated there herself. He goes through Sanaya's call records and gets a crucial lead. Sanaya had called up four wrong numbers that day, which Madhav finds strange. On his hunch he enquires about the past records of these numbers and gets to know that they belong to professional drug dealers. It turns out that Sanaya, after staying away from drugs for 3 years, had suddenly wanted to go back to drugs a night before she was killed. She was part of a charity where her father's close friend and wife were the owners.
