    "text": "\"Heroes\" is a pop song by Austrian singer Conchita Wurst. It was released on 8 November 2014. Conchita revealed to fans via her Facebook page that the release of the single would occur on 20 October and revealed the song title. The song is included on Wurst's debut album. ==Promotion and composition== Musically \"Heroes\" is a departure from Wurst's operatic pop style known from former singles like \"Rise Like a Phoenix\" or \"That's What I Am\". The composition still incorporates orchestral and classical elements but in a more minimal way. In contrast, the percussion elements are stronger than in her previous work. The song is mainly built of elements from baroque pop combined with parts of soul pop and world beat. Wurst pointed out that \"Heroes\" has invented a wholly different genre: \"Ein ganz anderes Genre\". It lasts for 3:43 minutes with support by a backing choir. Wurst called the song \"... cooler than I thought I could sound like\". The themes of \"Heroes\" are love, self empowerment and the battle against intolerance through the use of phrases such as, \"Love is like a battle cry and we'll shine till our colours light up the sky and we'll dance to the sound of our battle cry\". \"Heroes\" was released with significant anticipation from fans and the media on 8 November with its first live performance on Wetten, dass..? in Graz. The release date occurred two days before her birthday: \"Conchita Wurst has released 'Heroes', bringing to an end months of anticipation for her countless fans around the world.
