    "text": "Repton School Ground is a cricket ground in Repton, Derbyshire, England, owned by Repton School and used by the school's teams. The ground has hosted a single List A match, when Derbyshire faced Middlesex in a 40-over Refuge Assurance League match in 1988. Middlesex fielded first, and bowled the hosts out for 130 off 37.1 overs, despite Steve Goldsmith's 61. Angus Fraser returned figures of 8-2-8-3. Rain curtailed the match during the Middlesex reply with the score at 32/0 after 10.2 overs, and, as insufficient overs had been bowled according to the competition rules, the match was considered a no result. The ground is also used by Derbyshire for 2nd XI and youth fixtures. Derbyshire Women have played two Women's County Championship matches at Repton, in 2011 and 2012. ==References== ==External links== * Cricinfo Website - Ground Page * Cricket Archive page Category:Cricket grounds in Derbyshire ",
