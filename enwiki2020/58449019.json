    "text": "According to the Spanish electoral law a grouping of electors (Spanish: agrupaci\u00f3n de electores) is a group of citizens temporarily associated with the goal of presenting a candidature to a particular election. It is a format that a candidature can use to present to a given election. To present the candidature, a candidate must present a minimum number of signatures relative to the electoral census. Given its temporary nature, if the promoters wanted to use the grouping for another election, the latter must be re-constituted. Unlike political parties, party federations or electoral coalitions, a grouping of electors cannot profit from public electoral funding from a preceding candidature. == Signatures == === Municipal elections === As established in the Art. 192 of the electoral law, the required number of signatures depends on the size of the municipality: * Under 5,000 inhabitants, the number of signatures must be no less than the 1% of voters as long as the number of signataries is over the double of electable councillors. * Between 5,001 and 10,000 inhabitants, at least 100 signatures * Between 10,001 and 50,000 inhabitants, at least 500 signatures * Between 50,001 and 150,000 inhabitants, at least 1,500 signatures * Between 150,001 and 300,000 inhabitants, at least 3,000 signatures * Between 300,001 and 1,000,000 inhabitants, at least 5,000 signatures * In larger areas, at least 8,000 signatures === General elections === For a group of electors to compete in a given general election, they must present a minimum number of signatures, amounting to the 1% of the electors in the electoral district (which correspond to each province and Ceuta and Melilla). === European elections === For a group of electors to compete in a given election to the European Parliament, they must present a minimum of 15,000 signatures. == References == Category:Elections in Spain ",
