He was mainly associated with opera and vocal music. He also wrote a work on the leitmotifs in Richard Wagner's operas, and he was an authority on heraldry. ==Biography== Aylmer Wilhelmy Buesst was born in 1883 in Melbourne, the son of William Augustus Buesst (1846\u20131935)The LaTrobe Journal, No. 80, Spring 2007 and Helen Violette Buesst (n\u00e9e Pett). His brothers were Victor Augustine (1885-1960; a composer), and Tristan No\u00ebl Marchand (1894-1982; a soldier, barrister and collector of Australiana). The Buesst family had migrated in the 1870s from Staffordshire in England, \"buesst\" being an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \"stout\". Nevertheless, his mother later pretended the name was German, and sometimes added an umlaut (B\u00fcesst) to make it appear so. He studied the violin in Melbourne, where he was celebrated as a prodigy. During the 1890s the visiting virtuoso Joseph Joachim noticed him, and took him to Breslau to study with him. He had further studies at the Breslau Conservatory, then with C\u00e9sar Thomson in Brussels and August Wilhelmj in London. His music studies continued at the Leipzig Conservatory, including conducting studies with Arthur Nikisch. In 1911 he was invited to conduct the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester, England. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, he was imprisoned in Strangeways Prison as an enemy alien in the belief that he was a German, since he spoke German fluently, had developed a German- sounding English accent from his years of study on the European continent, and had also adopted the umlaut when writing his surname. He enlisted the aid of a friend on the outside, Sir Gerald Woods Wollaston (a future Garter Principal King of Arms 1930-1944) in researching his ancestry, to prove that he was of purely English stock. Wollaston was able to secure his release after ten months. In the process, Wollaston had a Grant of Arms organised for Buesst. Ironically, due to his excellent German, Buesst (who had quickly dropped the umlaut) was then used in interrogating captured German officers and generally helping with translations throughout the remainder of the war. Despite being cleared of any German sympathies or family connections, he was not required anymore at the Hall\u00e9 due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment. He returned to Breslau, becoming Kapellmeister there. It was in Breslau that he became interested in heraldry himself, and started what would later become a vast collection of books and other material on European heraldry, including all the coats of arms of the Holy Roman Empire. His library was later donated to help found the collection of the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies.Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies Aylmer Buesst conducted the Moody-Manners Opera Company, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, then the Beecham Opera Company 1916-17 and 1919-20.
