    "text": "Euphrates () was an eminent Stoic philosopher, who lived c. 35\u2013118 AD. ==Biography== According to Philostratus,Philostratus, Vitae sophistorum i. 7, Vit. Apoll. i. 13 he was a native of Tyre, and according to Stephanus of Byzantium,Stephanus, Epiphaneia of Epiphania in Syria; whereas Eunapius calls him an Egyptian. At the time when Pliny the Younger served in Syria (c. 81 AD), he became acquainted with Euphrates, and seems to have formed an intimate friendship with him. In one of his lettersPliny the Younger, Epistles, i. 10 he gives us a detailed account of the virtues and talents of Euphrates: > Euphrates is possessed of so many shining talents, that he cannot fail to > strike and engage even the somewhat illiterate. He reasons with much force, > penetration, and elegance, and frequently embodies all the sublime and > luxuriant eloquence of Plato. His style is rich and various, and at the same > time so wonderfully sweet, that it seduces the attention of the most > unwilling hearer. His outward appearance is agreeable to all the rest: he > has a tall figure, a comely aspect, long hair, and a large white beard: > circumstances which though they may probably be thought trifling and > accidental, contribute however to gain him much reverence. There is no > uncouthness in his manner, which is grave, but not austere; and his approach > commands respect without creating awe. Distinguished as he is by the > sanctity of his life, he is no less so by his polite and affable address. He > points his eloquence against the vices, not the persons of mankind, and > without chastising reclaims the wanderer. His exhortations so captivate your > attention, that you hang as it were upon his lips; and even after the heart > is convinced, the ear still wishes to listen to the harmonious reasoner. His great power as an orator is acknowledged also by other contemporaries,Epictetus, Discourses, iii. 15, iv. 8; Marcus Aurelius, x. 31 though Apollonius of Tyana charges him with avarice and servile flattery. He asked and obtained from emperor Hadrian the permission of putting an end to himself by poison, \"since Hadrian permitted him to drink hemlock in consideration of his extreme age and his malady.Dio Cassius, lxix. 8. Marcus Aurelius may be referring to him in passing, when he laments the death of a Euphrates, along with other philosophers.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 10.31 ==References== Category:1st-century philosophers Category:Roman-era Stoic philosophers Category:Ancient Romans who committed suicide Category:35 births Category:118 deaths Category:Male suicides ",
