Naoko and Michie had developed a friendship while attending college together. After they graduated, they began working at different companies but soon came to be bored with the mundaneness of corporate life. Since they all deeply loved music, the three decided to play music together just for the fun of it. Naoko sang lead and played guitar, Nakatani was also a lead singer and played bass and keyboards, and Atsuko sang backup, played drums, and designed their stage outfits. With the departure of Nakatani and Atsuko relegated to part-time duty due to marriage, Naoko stands as the only remaining member of the original lineup. Her musical preference leans towards 1970s hard rock and heavy metal such as Kiss, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Mot\u00f6rhead, and Black Sabbath as well as 1960s pop groups and punk rock bands such as The Beatles, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Buzzcocks, and The Ramones. ==References== ==External links== *Shonen Knife Biography *From Naoko Blog Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Women guitarists Category:Japanese female rock singers Category:Japanese alternative rock musicians Category:Shonen Knife members Category:Japanese rock guitarists Category:Japanese punk rock musicians Category:People from Osaka Prefecture Category:20th-century Japanese singers Category:21st-century Japanese singers Category:20th-century women singers Category:21st-century women singers ",
