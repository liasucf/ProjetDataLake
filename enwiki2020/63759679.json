    "text": "Geopathology (also Geopathy) is a theory that links the Earth's inherent radiation with the health of humans, animals and plant life. The term is derived from Greek \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9- (ge\u014d-), combining form of \u03b3\u1fc6 (g\u00ea, \u201cearth\u201d) and \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (p\u00e1thos, \u201csuffering\u201d) - ie pathology, widely used to describe infirmities. The term is more widely used in the adjectival form ie 'geopathic' (sometimes 'geopathological') and often linked to 'stress', creating the terms 'geopathic stress' and 'geostress'. Gustav Frieherr von Pohl has been described as the modern 'father' of geopathic stress. von Pohl conducted a study in the Bavarian town of Vilsbiburg in 1929 which purported to link focus points of 'earth-radiation' ger. Erdstrahlen with incidence of cancer. Ley lines (a supposition introduced by Alfred Watkins in 1925) have also been suggested to create geopathic stress. == Geopathic stress (GS) == It is suggested that the Earth has a natural vibration, but features like underground watercourses, drainage pipes, underground tunnels and even simple geological faults distort this vibration. Such distorted vibrations are held to rise upwards through the Earth's surface and create an pernicious effect on the health and/or behaviour of all biological life.http://skepdic.com/erays.html The distortions are amplified during night hours and consequently the impact is greater if the focal point of the adverse radiation is a bedroom, also noting that the subject, during the time of sleep, will be continually located in the path of such radiation. == Published academic papers and research == * * * * == External links == * https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/lifestyle/healthandlife/geopathic- stress-just-for-the-gullible-863019.html * https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/aug/20/bad-vibrations- whats-the-evidence-for-geopathic-stress == Further reading == * Rolf Gordon Are You Sleeping In A Safe Place?, 1989 * Paul Craddock, Geopathic Stress & Electropolution: How to Protect Your Health & Home, 2016 * Ulrike Banis, Geopathic Stress - and what you can do about it, 2003 * Robert Egby, The Silent Killer Below: Hunting and Healing Geopathic Stress, 2018 * Judy Hall, Crystal Prescriptions volume 3: Crystal solutions to electromagnetic pollution and geopathic stress.
