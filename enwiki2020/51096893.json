    "text": "George Arnold (1881, Hong Kong - 1962) was a British entomologist who specialised in aculeate Hymenoptera (particularly ants, sphecid wasps and pompilid wasps). From the Royal College of Science he was appointed to the Department of Cytology and Cancer Research at Liverpool and then only worked on Hymenoptera as a hobby. In 1911 he became curator, and later director, of the National Museum of Southern Rhodesia, Bulawayo. The butterfly species Anthene arnoldi, or Arnold's hairtail, was named after him by Neville Jones in 1918. ==Works== Many scientific papers in Annals of the South African Museum and Occasional Papers: National Museum of Southern Rhodesia. ==References== *Pinhey, E.C.G. 1977.
