The wingspan is 22\u201330 mm for males and 27\u201336 mm for females. The forewings and hindwings of the males are pale ochreous white and those of the females are white with an ochreous-yellow anal tuft. The larvae possibly feed on Saccharum arundinaceum and Saccharum spontaneum, but these records may be based on a misindentification. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1863 Category:Schoenobiinae Category:Moths of Asia ",
