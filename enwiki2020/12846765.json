    "text": "The Electoral district of Swan Hill was a rural Lower House electoral district of the Victorian Parliament. It was located within the Northern Victoria Region of the Legislative Council. The area had previously been part of the electoral districts of Wimmera (1851-89), Crowlands (1858-77), and Donald & Swan Hill (1889-1904). At its beginning in 1904, the district spanned the Victorian Mallee region, covering not only Swan Hill and its surrounds, but also the Mildura area. This changed in 1927, with the creation of the electoral district of Mildura. At its end in 2014, the district included the towns of Birchip, Charlton, Donald, Kerang, Murtoa, St Arnaud, Sea Lake, Warracknabeal, Wedderburn and Wycheproof, as well as the titular city of Swan Hill. Natural features of the electorate included Lake Tyrrell and the Murray River, which was a popular tourist destination and the centre of a flourishing irrigation area. Farming and agriculture were important industries throughout the region. Due to the region making up an increasingly smaller proportion of the state's population, in 2014 it became part of the electoral district of Murray Plains. ==Members for Swan Hill== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term |- | | | rowspan=\"4\"|John Gray | Ministerialist | rowspan=\"4\"|1904\u20131917 |- | | | Independent |- | | | Commonwealth Liberal |- | | | Nationalist |- | | | Percy Stewart | Farmers Union | 1917\u20131919 |- | | | rowspan=\"2\"|Francis Old | Farmers Union | rowspan=\"2\"|1919\u20131945 |- | | | Country |- | | | rowspan=\"2\"|John Hipworth | Country | 1945\u20131949 |- | | | Liberal | 1949\u20131952 |- | | | Harold Stirling | Country | 1952\u20131968 |- | | | Henry Broad | Country | 1968\u20131973 |- | | | Alan Wood | Liberal | 1973\u20131983 |- | | | Barry Steggall | National | 1983\u20132002 |- | | | Peter Walsh | National | 2002\u20132014 |- |} ==Election results== ==See also== * Parliaments of the Australian states and territories * List of members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly ==External links== * Electorate profile: Swan Hill District, Victorian Electoral Commission Category:Former electoral districts of Victoria (Australia) Category:1904 establishments in Australia Category:2014 disestablishments in Australia ",
