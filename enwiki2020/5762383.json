The Troubles were a period of conflict in Northern Ireland involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries, the British security forces, and civil rights groups. The Troubles are usually dated from the late 1960s through the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. However, sporadic violence continued after this point. Those that continued violence past this point are referred to as \"dissident republicans and loyalists\". By 1998 the Troubles had claimed roughly 3500 lives. ==Prior to 1960== Since partition, the IRA had started a number of military operations in Northern Ireland designed at bringing about their goal of a United Ireland. The intensity of this activity increased towards the end of 1941, where the IRA decided to step up its campaign of attacks in Northern Ireland.CAIN: Chronology of Key Events in Irish History, 1800 to 1967; section 1941 and onwards, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 13 April 2018. In response to this activity the Unionist authorities under John Miller Andrews introduced internment and using provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, instituted increasingly restrictive policies in Northern Ireland. This pattern of paramilitary violence, followed by increasingly restrictive measures on the behalf of the authorities came to define the run-up to the Troubles. ==1960\u20131969== Since 1964, civil rights activists had been protesting against the discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists by the Ulster Protestant and unionist government of Northern Ireland. The civil rights movement called for: 'one man, one vote'; the end to gerrymandered electoral boundaries; the end to discrimination in employment and in the allocation of public housing; repeal of the Special Powers Act; and the disbanding of the Ulster Special Constabulary. ===1966=== {|\"floatright\" |- | style=\"width:100px; vertical- align:top;\"| April |Loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) to oppose the civil rights movement.
