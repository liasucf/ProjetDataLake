    "text": "Joseph Duffy (Irish: Seosamh \u00d3 Dubhthaigh) (born 18 February 1988) is an Irish retired mixed martial artist who competed in the lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. A professional since 2008, he has formerly competed for Cage Warriors and was a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team Koscheck. He is also a former professional boxer. ==Early life== Duffy is from Meenbanad, Burtonport, County Donegal. His family emigrated when he was young to the industrial town of Ebbw Vale in Wales, from where they travelled back and forth to Burtonport regularly. Duffy is a big rugby fan, and growing up he says \"I would always have made it known I wasn\u2019t from Wales\", which made his support for Ireland during the Six Nations a bit difficult sometimes. He claimed \"if Ireland lost in the rugby, I would try to skip the next day at school, just to avoid the hassle it would bring\". Duffy also played the sport through his youth, and despite captaining his school\u2019s rugby team, it was martial arts that always occupied the majority of Duffy\u2019s time. He started with taekwon-do before progressing to traditional jiu-jitsu, a foundation that eventually led him to a career in professional MMA. Duffy went 23\u20130\u20135 in amateur MMA competition winning the Welsh Grapple & Strike Welterweight championship. ==Boxing career== Despite knowing from an early age that he wanted to be a MMA fighter, Duffy said \"I always wondered how I would get on in boxing\". He continued \"it was never something I thought about pursuing. I had never boxed, even at amateur, until a few years ago\". Duffy cited \"the opportunity to work with one of the best coaches in the boxing world\" as the main reason for his switch, and the chance \"to spar with some of the best fighters in the world; James DeGale, Andy Lee, George Groves, Chris Eubank, Jr.\", something he deemed \"priceless\". The decision was then made even easier, with Duffy explaining \"I was fortunate enough to have sponsors to back me as well. That took care of the financial worries\". When reflecting on the experience, he stated \"More than anything, I\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t want to have any regrets. When I\u2019m old I want to be able to say that I gave it a go. That\u2019s what it was. I got to fight professionally and I got to spar with some of the best fighters in the world\". ==Mixed martial arts career== Duffy started his career as a welterweight, fighting in various regional promotions across the UK.
