    "text": "The Eastern Carolina League was a minor league baseball affiliation which operated in the Eastern part of North Carolina. The league had two distinct periods of operation: 1908-1910 and a revival of the league in 1928-1929. It was classified as a \"D\" league. The most famous person to play in the league was Jim Thorpe, considered by some the greatest athlete of the twentieth century. It was his involvement with the Eastern Carolina League that cost him his amateur status and his Olympic medals. == Eastern Carolina League Champions == *1908-None \u2020 *1909-Wilson *1910-Fayetteville *1928-Goldsboro *1929-Rocky Mount \u2020 In late August 1908, Eastern North Carolina was hit by what is now known as Tropical Storm #5.http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/1908/5/track.gif The playoffs were abandoned with Wilmington leading Wilson 2 games to 1. ==Complete team list (1908-1910,1928-1929)== * Fayetteville Highlanders (1909\u201310,1928\u201329) * Goldsboro Giants (1908\u201310) * Goldsboro Goldbugs (1929) * Goldsboro Manufacturers (1928) * Greenville Tobacconists (1928\u201329) * Kinston \u2021 (1908) * Kinston Eagles (1928\u201329) * New Bern \u2021 (1908) * Raleigh Red Birds (1908\u201310) * Rocky Mount Buccaneers (1928\u201329) * Rocky Mount Railroaders (1909\u201310) * Wilmington Pirates (1928\u201329) * Wilmington Sailors (1908\u201310) * Wilson Tobacconists (1908\u201310) \u2021 These teams had no known nicknames. ==External links== *Page about Thorpe *BR Bullpen page ==References== Category:Defunct minor baseball leagues in the United States Category:Baseball leagues in North Carolina ",
