Al-Qarah is one of Al-Ahsa's eastern villages and is located about 10 km from Al-Hofuf, city center, 140 km Southwest of Dammam and 300 km East of Riyadh. ==Jabl Al-Qarah== Jabl Al-Qarah (Arabic = \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0629, which means mountain of Al-Qarah) is a mesa that stands about high, with a maximum elevation of 225 meter above sea level. It has many caves with very cool air inside. Unlike many caves, these were formed by subaerial weathering rather than dissolution, and as a result have a highly distinctive shape. The mountain attracts many people especially from nearby villages, and has been targeted for additional tourist development. Although there are no other hills for a considerable distance, Jabl Al-Qarah is an outlier of the larger Shedgum Plateau. The caves, which include 28 tall linear passageways totaling in length, have long been a site of commerce. Some caves of Jabl Al-Garah have traditionally been the site of the workshops of local traditional potters, who are known for the quality of their wares. A plaque about the mountain and a parking lot near the main access trail is at . ==References== ==See also== *Al-Ahsa Category:Geography of Saudi Arabia ",
