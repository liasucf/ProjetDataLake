NME ranked the album at number 54 in their list of the \"61 of the Greatest Film Soundtracks\".https://www.nme.com/photos/61-of-the- greatest-film-soundtracks-ever/207108#/photo/10 == Singles == \"Container Park\" was released as a free download after the release of the initial download of Hanna and before the later CD release. == Critical reception == The soundtrack received mostly positive responses from music critics, with many praising The Chemical Brothers for having produced solid background music. However a few critics have cited a lack of experimentation as one of the flaws. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album holds a score of 65, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on seven reviews all compiled from critics. Chad Grischow of IGN reserved high praise for the soundtrack, feeling that the \"duo nail the mix of violence and innocence\". == Track listing == == Chart performance == * No. 7 in the US Billboard Top Electronic Albums * No. 11 in the US Billboard Top Soundtracks == References == Category:The Chemical Brothers albums Category:2011 soundtrack albums Category:Back Lot Music soundtracks ",
