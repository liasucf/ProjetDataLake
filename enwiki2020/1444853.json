    "text": "Uruguay elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. == Presidential elections == The president and the vice-president are elected on one ballot for a five-year term by the people. Each party must elect its candidates for President and Vice-President in primary elections, which are usually held in June. The selected candidates face the electorate in the general elections in October. If no candidate obtains the absolute majority of votes, there is a runoff between the two most-voted candidates. == Parliamentary elections == The General Assembly (Asamblea General) has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies (C\u00e1mara de Diputados) has 99 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation. The Chamber of Senators (C\u00e1mara de Senadores) has 31 members elected for a five-year term by proportional representation and the Vice-president. Uruguay has a multi-party system, with three dominant political parties, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. ==Schedule== ===Election=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 |- !Type | Presidential (October) National Congress (October) Gubernatorial (October) ||None ||colspan=3| None || Presidential (October) National Congress (October) Gubernatorial (October)|| None |- !President and vice president |President and vice president ||None ||colspan=3|None ||President and vice president|| None |- !National Congress |All seats ||None ||colspan=3|None ||All seats|| None |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |None ||All positions ||colspan=3|None ||None ||All positions |} ===Inauguration=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 |- !Type | Presidential (March) National Congress (March) Gubernatorial (March) ||colspan=4| None || Presidential (March) National Congress (March) Gubernatorial (March) |- !President and vice president |March 1 ||colspan=4|None ||March 1st |- !National Congress |February 15 ||colspan=4|None ||February 15 |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |July 8 ||colspan=4|None ||July 11th |} ==Latest elections== ===2019 general election=== On 25 November, preliminary results in the runoff election showed Lacalle Pou with a majority (48.71%) by 28,666 votes over Mart\u00ednez (47.51%), which delayed the announcement of a winner as 35,229 absentee vote needed to be counted.
