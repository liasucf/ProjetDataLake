    "text": "The 2017 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 was a road cycling stage race that took place between 4 and 11 June 2017. It was the 69th edition of the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 and was the twenty-third event of the 2017 UCI World Tour. The race was won on the final day by Danish rider Jakob Fuglsang, riding for the team. Having trailed overnight leader Richie Porte () by 75 seconds going into the stage, Fuglsang made his bid for victory by attacking along with 's Romain Bardet and rider Dan Martin on the Col de la Colombi\u00e8re, around from the finish. They were later caught before the final climb; Fuglsang and Martin went clear again on that climb, with Fuglsang later dropping Martin. Fuglsang remained clear to the finish, winning his second stage of the race by 12 seconds from Martin. Porte ultimately finished the stage in seventh place, 75 seconds behind Fuglsang; however, with bonus seconds in play on the race, Fuglsang's ten-second bonus gave him the race victory by ten seconds over Porte, a first for Denmark at the race. Martin finished third overall, as his six-second bonus allowed him to overtake Chris Froome () by a single second. In the race's other classifications, rider Arnaud D\u00e9mare won the points classification while rider Koen Bouwman won the mountains classification having won the second and third stages respectively. 's Emanuel Buchmann won the young rider classification, while won the teams classification. ==Teams== As the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 is a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to enter a team in the race.

The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the individual time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a yellow jersey with a blue bar; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the race. {| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Points for the points classification |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 ! scope=\"col\" | 6 ! scope=\"col\" | 7 ! scope=\"col\" | 8 ! scope=\"col\" | 9 ! scope=\"col\" | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Stages 1\u20133 & 5 | 25 || 22 || 20 || 18 || 16 || 14 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Stages 4, 6\u20138 | 15 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 |} Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. More points were awarded on the flatter stages in the opening half of the race. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Points for the mountains classification |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 ! scope=\"col\" | 6 ! scope=\"col\" | 7 ! scope=\"col\" | 8 ! scope=\"col\" | 9 ! scope=\"col\" | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 15 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 10 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 2 || 1 ||colspan=4| 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 5 || 3 || 2 || 1 ||colspan=6| 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 2 || 1 ||colspan=8| 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 1 ||colspan=9| 0 |} There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey with white polka dots. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Hors-category climbs awarded the most points; the first ten riders were able to accrue points, compared with the first six on first-category climbs, the first four on second-category, the first two on third-category and only the first for fourth-category. The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1992 were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font- size:smaller;\" |+Classification leadership by stage |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\" | Stage ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14%;\" | Winner ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\" | General classification alt=A yellow jersey with a blue band. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Points classification alt=A green jersey. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Mountains classification alt=A red jersey with white polka dots. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Young rider classification alt=A white jersey. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Team classification alt=A white jersey with a yellow number bib. |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1 | Thomas De Gendt |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=5| Thomas De Gendt |style=\"background:#9CE97B;\"| Thomas De Gendt |style=\"background:pink\" rowspan=4| Thomas De Gendt |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=3| Pierre Latour |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=3| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2 | Arnaud D\u00e9mare |style=\"background:#9CE97B;\"| Sonny Colbrelli |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3 | Koen Bouwman |style=\"background:#9CE97B;\" rowspan=6| Arnaud D\u00e9mare |- ! scope=\"row\" | 4 | Richie Porte |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=2| Sam Oomen |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=2| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 5 | Phil Bauhaus |style=\"background:pink\" rowspan=4| Koen Bouwman |- ! scope=\"row\" | 6 | Jakob Fuglsang |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=2| Richie Porte |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=3| Emanuel Buchmann |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=3| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 7 | Peter Kennaugh |- ! scope=\"row\" | 8 | Jakob Fuglsang |style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| Jakob Fuglsang |- ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | Final ! style=\"background:#FFDB00;\"| Jakob Fuglsang ! style=\"background:#46E800;\"| Arnaud D\u00e9mare ! style=\"background:#FF3E33;\"| Koen Bouwman ! style=\"background:white;\"| Emanuel Buchmann ! style=\"background:#FFB927;\"| |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * 2017 Category:2017 UCI World Tour Category:2017 in French sport Category:June 2017 sports events in France ",
