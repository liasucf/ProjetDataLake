    "text": "Silay North Elementary School is a public school in Silay City, Philippines. It is located beside the Silay City Public Plaza at Rizal Street, and a meter away from the San Diego Cathedral Church. == History == Silay North Elementary School was an offshoot of the Gabaldon Act in 1970, which gave insular aid for the construction of a public school in every municipality of the Philippines. Established in 1907, Silay North was already 100 years last 2007. The school was actually a one-storey concrete building, which now houses the intermediate classes. A two-storey private house in the primary building was utilized by the city government to accommodate other classes. Last 2006, the primary building which comprises sixteen classrooms was vacated as per advised by the City Engineer's Office of Silay City after inspection. After World War II, a modern toilet was constructed for boys and girls. This was followed later by separate building for a lunch counter. During the early terms of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, a Marcos type of classroom building was further added to accommodate more classes. Because of the limited school area, few buildings were added such as computer laboratory and Grade 1 classrooms, which were all donated by the Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. During the Japanese occupation, the primary building was used as the Japanese garrison and many infamous investigations took place in those rooms. The Japanese government opened the school for school children who ere left in the town and classes were held in the intermediate building. When the American forces liberated the town, the 51st Division of the US Army also occupied the buildings. The primary building was made into an Infirmary area while the intermediate building was turned into living quarters and a mess hall. == Disaster == In the year 2011, a major earthquake struck the country, particularly some regions in Negros Occidental. One of the buildings was badly affected causing structural leaks and damages. The building was closed temporarily for a lengthy renovation due to budget deficiency, which prompted the request for further public donation. The students volunteered to help the school administration by fixing some furniture of their classrooms. == Present == At present, Silay North Elementary School has seventeen permanent small and big buildings, including the comfort rooms and dilapidated buildings. However, due to shortage of classrooms, sections were fused from seven to eight to five over six sections only. The school produces more than thousands of graduates every year.
