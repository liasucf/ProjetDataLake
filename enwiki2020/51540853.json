Additionally, upon the creation of the formal Section of Photography at the Smithsonian in 1896, Smillie was appointed a Smithsonian Custodian in charge of the growing photographic collection; he would hold both positions until his death in 1917.Today in Smithsonian History: July 15, 1896. The Section of Photographic History, Division of Graphic Arts, United States National Museum, is established with Thomas William Smillie as custodian One of Smillie's interests was in preserving the history of photography. After assuming his curatorial duties, he decided that, \"an effort will be made hereafter, especially in connection with the future expositions of amateur photography, to secure such works as are necessary to make the collection in the National Museum a reference and record collection, which shall not only be a matter of interest and pleasure to the public, but of practical value to the photographers themselves.\" His initial purchases for the Section of Photography included a camera and equipment owned by Samuel Morse. In 1913, Smillie curated the Smithsonian's first-ever photography exhibition. Frances Benjamin Johnston learned photography from him, among others.The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1, edited by Joan M.
