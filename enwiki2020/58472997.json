She dresses in red and is commonly the brains and the most level-headed of the 2. She carries around a tablet known as the WhyTab, which is used to look up facts on their cases. * Toby (voiced by Brody Allen): a bear, and Teri's younger brother. He dresses in blue and is the more creative of the 2, commonly inventing numerous complex inventions for the required case. He also carries around many non-electronic tools and knows morse code. * Rumy (voiced by Philece Sampler): a nervous pig who can be easily excitable, and will more often than not run away from anything that scares him. He is also one of the more emotionally sensitive members of the group, and can be upset if something hurtful happens. This also makes him a good babysitter. * Jay (voiced by Ryan Bartley): a hyperactive Blue Jay who can often speak faster than he thinks, and is the smallest member of the group. As a bird, he is the only member capable of flight, and can often be reckless, but playful and friendly. * Bean (voiced by Leigh Kelly): a young squirrel best friends with Jay and Rumy, often serving as the brains to their escapades. He is still daring, and will often pull off foolish decisions. As a squirrel, he has a love for acorns. * Millie (voiced by Abby Trott): a bespectacled rabbit, and the only one to wear glasses, which allow her to see. A talented artist and cook, Millie often serves as a babysitter to Bean, Jay and Rumy, and often draws while the other three play (though she'll join in a few times). She aspires to be a doctor. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television series by Saban Capital Group Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:Television series by Hasbro Studios Category:2018 South Korean television series debuts Category:American children's animated mystery television series Category:Television series by Entertainment One ",
