    "text": "Margaret Dragu (born 1953) is a Canadian dancer, writer, performance artist and feminist. ==Career== Dragu was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1953. Growing up she was influenced by traditional Romanian folk dancing. As an adult she spent time in New York, Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. She began her dance career in Calgary in 1969, studying under Yone Kvietys Young, who was an instructor of movement using elements of Dada. From Calgary, Dragu moved to New York in 1971, where she began working with Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, and the Laura Foreman dance company, as well as members of the Judson Church. Her work with movement evolved to include elements of \"burlesque, tap dancing, flamenco, and theatre.\" In 1973 Dragu moved to Montreal where she began a lengthy career as a striptease artist. In 1975 Dragu moved to Toronto and became affiliated with artist-run collectives including A Space and 15 Dance Lab. She taught classes in aerobics and strip at the A Space gallery. In Toronto Dragu attempted to organize around strippers' rights with the help of the Canadian Labour Congress and the Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists. The short lived strippers' union was called the Canadian Association for Burlesque Entertainers. In 1988 Dragu co-wrote Revelations: Essays on Striptease and Sexuality with A. S. A. Harrison, a collection of essays on the topics of striptease and sexual entertainment. Dragu has stated that she has a \"multi- personnae\" disorder, becoming Lady Justice, Verb Woman, Art Cinderella, and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pan. For a performance at Edmonton's Vision of Hope monument, with a sword, salt, wine and scales that viewers associate with Lady Justice, she honored the women killed in the massacre at Montreal's \u00c9cole Polytechnique. She has collaborated with artists such as Tom Dean, members of General Idea, Rodney Werden and Kate Craig, and members of the communities in which she performs. In 2012, Dragu won the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. Dragu resides in East Vancouver. She created a radio show, Momz Radio which focused on interviewing mothers about their experiences with motherhood. Through this research, she wrote a book by the same name, Momz Radio: Mothers Talkback. Dragu has created video art for YouTube, and writes two blogs, which she updates as Lady Justice and Verb Woman respectively. ==Choreographic works== Dragu's work is known for being interdisciplinary and site specific. She collaborates with other artists and sometimes, the public. Her work is often based strongly in activism, whether feminist, environmental, social or otherwise. *Slits (performance art group show; title of Dragu's performance: \"Der Blaue Engel\"; curator: Victoria Singh) Western Front, Vancouver, BC, January 25, 2003 *Pie Performances Richmond Art Gallery, Richmond, BC, January 2003 grunt gallery, Vancouver, BC, January 2003 Hamilton Art Gallery, Hamilton, BC, November 2002 *Casting (group improvisation with Reciprocity/cite) 7a*11d Performance Art Festival, Toronto, Ontario, November 2002 *The Wall is In My Head/le mur est dans ma tete/ Ich Habe Die Mauer in Meinem Kopf/lu muro e dentra mi testa'' (with ReciproCity/cite) Elle Corazon, Montreal, Quebec, October 2001 Gladstone Hotel, Toronto, Ontario, November 2001 *Living Art Cosmo Mall, Richmond, BC, November 2000 Cleaning and Loving (It) Queen's Park/V Tape, FADO, Toronto, Ontario, July 2000 *Conscious Corpus: Corp Domestique & Corpus Delicious Western Front, Vancouver, BC, May 7\u201310, 2000 *Improvisation for X\u2019s and O\u2019s (with 25 lb. of potatoes) Grunt Gallery/Vogue Theatre, Vancouver, BC, Oct.1999 (with guitarist Brian Krocher) Niagara Artists\u2019 Centre, St. Catharines, Ont., June 1999 (with violinist Jim Munro) Grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC, February 1999 *Eine Kleine Nacht Radio/a little night radio Niagara Artists\u2019 Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario, June 1999 Artword Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, June 1999 grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC, February 1999 (German Tour by Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs & International Trade with Hessiche Ministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kunst of Germany & Cultural Dept. of Netherlands) Moltkerei Werkstadt, Koln, Germany darK.-Halle, Mainz, Germany c.u.b.a., Munster, Germany Carl Stipendium, Essen, Germany Artis, s\u2019Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, June 1998 *X\u2019s & O\u2019s for the Rites/Right of May Richmond Cultural Centre, Richmond, BC, May Day, 1999 *Otzenrath Stipendium Otzenrath, Bonn, Germany, June 1998 *A Deconstructed Dollhouse/une maison de poupees en deconstruction The @ Gallery, Vancouver, BC, April 1997 Theatre, Toronto, Ontario Niagara Artists' Collective, St. Catharines, Ontario Le Lieu's rencontre intern. d'art performance et multimedia, Quebec City, PQ, Oct.1996 *Secret Kitchen Richmond Public Library/Cultural Building, Richmond, BC; March 1998 Silverton Art Gallery, Silverton, BC, July 1995 Women in View Festival, Station Arts Theatre, Vancouver, BC, January 1995 New Performance Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1992 Festival, grunt gallery, Vancouver, BC, September 1991 Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, August 1990 *The Bardo Gap Western Front, Vancouver, BC, September 1994 Nine Suits with Paul Gibbons and Jim Munro Silverton Art Gallery, Silverton, BC, July 1995 with Jim Munro, Bill Smith, Dana Inglis and David Lee Mayworks Arts Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1994 *Sliced Bread -with Jim Munro, Roy Kiyooka, Bill Smith and Dana Inglis Mayworks Arts Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1993 EDAM Dance Studio, Western Front, Vancouver, BC, February 1993 *Square Foot Real/realite au metre carre - with Jim Munro Niagara Artists' Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario Music Gallery, Toronto, Ontario, with guest artist David Prentice Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario Oboro, Montreal, Quebec; October 1992 *Pheromones - with Billy Little, Bill Smith, Jim Munro & Joey Meyer Artropolis, Vancouver, BC, November 1990 *Original X's & O's Series X's & O's for the Canadian Pavilion Expo '86, Vancouver, BC, August 1986 X's & O's for Friday the Thirteenth Western Front, Vancouver, BC, November 1985 X's & O's in the Dead of Winter Off Centre Centre, Calgary, Alberta, January 1984 X's & O's on the Shortest Day of the Year Art Gallery of Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario, Dec. 21/83 X's & O's on the Longest Day of the Year Art Gallery of Hamilton's Artworks in the Garden, Royal Botanical Garden of Burlington, Ontario, June 21/83 JOY OF MULTIDICIPLINE Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, March 1986 Emily Carr School of Art, Vancouver, BC, November 1985 Artcite Gallery, Windsor, Ontario, December 1984 Niagara Artists' Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario, May 1984 Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta, January 1984 Alberta School of Art, Calgary, Alberta, January 1984 Articule, Montreal, Quebec, November 1983 *My Wireless is Running- with Colin Campbell Toronto Dance Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, May\u2013June 1984 *I\u2019m Already Chaning my Mind \u2013 with Colin Campbell Harbourfront Studio Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, June 1982 Fear of Blue/angst vor blau - with Tom Dean Akademie der Kunste, Berlin, Germany, January 1983 London Art Gallery, London, Ontario, November 1982 Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, October 1982 *Her Majesty/sa majeste - with Tom Dean Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, March 1981 Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels, Belgium, February 1981 *D.W.I.
