Wenceslas challenged him to a personal duel, but Radslav saw two angels beside Wenceslaus and didn't hurt him. He returned to Kou\u0159im with his army. The story is recorded in the Chronicle of Dalimil. Radslav is a semi-legendary person, maybe the brother of Vok, Slavn\u00edk's mythic father. ==References== * Category:Medieval Bohemian nobility Category:Angelic visionaries Category:10th-century Bohemian people ",
