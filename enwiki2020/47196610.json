    "text": "County Books volumes (right) The County Books series, by Robert Hale and Company of London, covered counties and regions in the British Isles. It was launched in March 1947, and began with Kent, Surrey and Sussex. The series was announced as completed in 1954, in 60 volumes, with Lowlands of Scotland: Edinburgh and the South by Maurice Lindsay. The announced intention was to give \"a true and lively picture of each county and people\". Brian Vesey- Fitzgerald was general editor of the County Books, and he also edited a series of Regional Books for Robert Hale. Both series were eulogistic about the countryside. ==The County Books== {|border=1 !Title !Year !Author |- |Bedfordshire||1950||Laurence Meynell |- |Berkshire||1952||Ian Yarrow |- |Buckinghamshire||1950||Alison Uttley |- |Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and The Isle of Ely||1951||Eric Arnold Roberts Ennion |- |Cheshire||1949||Frederick Herbert Crossley |- |The Channel Islands||1953||Wilfred D.
