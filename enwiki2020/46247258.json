    "text": "Chalmers-Wesley United Church is a Protestant church located within the walls of Old Quebec City at 78 rue Sainte-Ursule, Qu\u00e9bec (QC). Designed by architect John Wells for the Free Presbyterian Church of Canada, the church was built from 1851-1853 and opened for worship on March 6, 1853. It is particularly admired for its Gothic Revival design. In 1925 the church became part of the newly formed United Church of Canada. Composer William Reed was notably the church's organist from 1900-1913. In 1931 the congregation of the nearby Wesleyan Methodist Church, which had also become part of The United Church of Canada, merged with Chalmers United Church and was renamed Chalmers-Wesley United Church. \"Remember All the Way: The History of Chalmers-Wesley United Church, Quebec City\" by George W.
