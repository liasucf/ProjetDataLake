Robert made his debut as director, and cast himself in the film's lead role. Vanitha chose to produce the film for an old production studio, Vanitha Film Production, launched by her parents, Vijayakumar and Manjula in the 1980s. It subsequently became the studio's third film following Nenjangal (1982) and Kai Kodukkum Kai (1984). The film was titled MGR Sivaji Rajini Kamal after popular Tamil actors MGR, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan \u2013 who Vanitha claimed she paid tribute through with the title. The film was edited by R. J. Anand, while Vanitha also wrote the film's screenplay and dialogues. Actresses Nirosha and Aishwarya were also a part of the film, while comedians Powerstar Srinivasan and Premgi Amaren appeared in guest roles. ==Soundtrack== For the film, music composer Srikanth Deva was credited as Sri. ==Release== The film opened in May 2015 to negative reviews from critics. A reviewer from DesiMartini.com wrote \"the script was intended to make the audience laugh but the execution was annoying\", and that \"other technical aspects are very mediocre and very ordinary stuff\" and the \"writing is very amateurish and the film is very low on production values\". Another reviewer noted that the film was \"amateurishly written and poorly executed\". The film did not perform well at the box office. In 2019, Robert denied that he was romantically involved with Vanitha and claimed that the pair decided to make the film on professional terms. He added that he and Vanitha told the media about their alleged relationship in order to promote the film. Vanitha later called out Robert for his false interviews, and stated that the film was indeed produced when the pair were in a relationship. ==References== ==External links== *MGR Sivaji Rajini Kamal at YouTube Category:2015 films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:2010s Tamil- language films Category:2015 comedy films Category:Indian slapstick comedy films Category:Films scored by Srikanth Deva Category:2015 directorial debut films ",
