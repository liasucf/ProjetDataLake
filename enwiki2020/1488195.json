    "text": "There are two fundamental theorems of welfare economics. The first states that a market in equilibrium under perfect competition will be Pareto optimal in the sense that no further exchange would make one person better off without making another worse off. The requirements for perfect competition are these:http://web.stanford.edu/~hammond/effMktFail.pdf # There are no externalitiesie. firms can\u2019t pass their costs onto other people without their consent. and no transaction costs, and each actor has perfect information. # Firms take prices \u2013 ie. behavior is competitive rather than monopolistic. The theorem is sometimes seen as an analytical confirmation of Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" principle, namely that competitive markets ensure an efficient allocation of resources in the short run.That they may fail to do so in the long run is shown by an observation of Harold Hotelling: see below. It supports a case for non-intervention in ideal conditions, saying that if we let the markets do the work, the outcome will be Pareto efficient. However Pareto efficiency is not a true social welfare function. There are many alternative Pareto efficient allocations of resources differing in their desirability, eg. one person may own everything and everyone else nothing. The first theorem suggests that intervention may have a legitimate place in policy. This leads to the second theorem, which tells us that a Pareto optimum can fall short of a given true optimum only in its distributional effects, implying that a true social optimum might be obtained by redistributing income and then letting the market take over. However attempts to correct the distribution may introduce distortions of their own, so full optimality may not be attainable.See the discussion on pp. 556 f of Mas-Colell et al. The theorems can be visualised graphically for a simple pure exchange economy by means of the Edgeworth box diagram. ==History of the fundamental theoremsHistorical summaries will be found in the works quoted by Wicksell, Samuelson and Arrow, and on Gon\u00e7alo Fonseca\u2019s \u2018History of Economic Thought\u2019 website https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/essays/paretian/paretoptimal.htm#fundamental. == === Adam Smith (1776) === In a discussion of import tariffs Adam Smith wrote that: > Every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the > society as great as he can... He is in this, as in many other ways, led by > an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By > pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more > effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\u2018Wealth of nations\u2019 > (1776), Book IV, Chap II. === L\u00e9on Walras (1870) === Walras wrote that \u2018exchange under free competition is an operation by which all parties obtain the maximum satisfaction subject to buying and selling at a uniform price\u2019.Paraphrased from Le\u00e7on 18 (first ed.) of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments. \u2018L\u2019\u00e9change de deux marchandises entre elles sur un march\u00e9 r\u00e9gi par la libre concurrence est une op\u00e9ration par laquelle tous les porteurs soit de l\u2019une des deux marchandises, soit de l\u2019autre, soit de toutes les deux, obtiennent la plus grande satisfaction de leurs besoins compatible avec cette condition de donner de la marchandise qu\u2019ils vendent et de recevoir de la marchandise qu\u2019ils ach\u00e8tent dans une proportion commune et identique.\u2019 According to Wicksell this passage moved to Le\u00e7on 10 in the 4th ed. This unsupported claim implies that each trader individually reaches an optimum while leaving open the possibility that all could do better if uniform pricing was abandoned.K. Wicksell, \u2018Lectures on Political Economy\u2019 I (1906), Eng. tr. (1934), p. 76; P. A. Samuelson, \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), pp. 204 f. === F. Y. Edgeworth (1881) === Edgeworth took a step towards the first fundamental theorem in his \u2018Mathematical Psychics\u2019, looking at a pure exchange economy with no production. Almost alone amongst economists he includes imperfect competition in its scope, which appears to be correct for his own limited case.Paul Samuelson backed him up, saying that the locus of Paretian optima can be obtained under multilateral monopoly. \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), p. 214. His definition of equilibrium is almost the same as Pareto\u2019s later definition of optimality: it is a point such that... > in whatever direction we take an infinitely small step, P and \u03a0 [the > utilities of buyer and seller] do not increase together, but that, while one > increases, the other decreases.p. 21. Instead of concluding that equilibrium was Pareto optimal as he was entitled to, he concludes that it optimises the sum of utilities of the parties: > It seems to follow on general dynamical principles applied to this special > case that equilibrium is attained when the total pleasure-energy of the > contractors is a maximum relative, or subject, to conditions... p. 25\\. See > also John Creedy, \u2018Francis Ysidro Edgeworth and Philip Henry Wicksteed\u2019 > (2010), https://core.ac.uk/reader/6561724. === Vilfredo Pareto (1906/9) === Pareto stated the first fundamental theorem in his Manuale (1906) and with more rigour in its French revision (Manuel, 1909).Manuale di Economia Politica con una Introduzione alla Scienza Sociale (1906) / Manuel d\u2019\u00c9conomie Politique (1909). He was the first to claim optimality under his own criterion or to support the claim by convincing arguments. He defines equilibrium more abstractly than Edgeworth as a state which would maintain itself indefinitely in the absence of external pressuresManuale / Manuel Chap III, \u00a722. and shows that in an exchange economy it is the point at which a common tangent to the parties\u2019 indifference curves passes through the endowment.\u00a7116. His definition of optimality is given in Chap. VI: > We will say that the members of a collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity > [ie. of utility] at a certain position when it is impossible to move a small > step away such that the ophelimity enjoyed by each individual in the > collectivity increases, or such that it diminishes. [He has previously > defined an increase in individual ophelimity as a move onto a higher > indifference curve.] That is to say that any small step is bound to increase > the ophelimity of some individuals while diminishing that of others.\u00a733. The following paragraph gives us a theorem: > For phenomena of type I [ie. perfect competition], when equilibrium takes > place at a point of tangency of indifference curves, the members of the > collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity. He adds that \u2018a rigorous proof cannot be given without the help of mathematics\u2019 and refers to his Appendix.\u00a735. Wicksell, referring to his definition of optimality, commented: > With such a definition it is almost self-evident that this so-called maximum > obtains under free competition, because if, after an exchange is effected, > it were possible by means of a further series of direct or indirect > exchanges to produce an additional satisfaction of needs for the > participators, then to that extent such a continued exchange would doubtless > have taken place, and the original position could not be one of final > equilibrium.K. Wicksell, \u2018Lectures on Political Economy\u2019 I (1906), Eng. tr. > (1934), pp. 82 f. Pareto didn\u2019t find it so straightforward. He gives a diagrammatic argument in his text, applying solely to exchange,\u00a735. and a 32-page mathematical argument in the AppendixManuel, \u00a7109\u2013end. which Samuelson found \u2018not easy to follow\u2019.P. A. Samuelson, \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), p. 212. Pareto was hampered by not having a concept of the production\u2013possibility frontier, whose development was due partly to his collaborator Enrico Barone.Thomas M. Humphrey, \u2018The Trade Theorist\u2019s Sacred Diagram: its Origin and Early Development\u2019 (1988). His own \u2018indifference curves for obstacles\u2019 seem to have been a false path. Shortly after stating the first fundamental theorem, Pareto asks a question about distribution: > Consider a collectivist society which seeks to maximise the ophelimity of > its members. The problem divides into two parts. Firstly we have a problem > of distribution: how should the goods within a society be shared between its > members? And secondly, how should production be organised so that, when > goods are so distributed, the members of society obtain the maximum > ophelimity? His answer is an informal precursor of the second theorem: > Having distributed goods according to the answer to the first problem, the > state should allow the members of the collectivity to operate a second > distribution, or operate it itself, in either case making sure that it is > performed in conformity with the workings of free competition.This and the > preceding quotation have been condensed from \u00a753 and \u00a755 of Chap. VI. === Enrico Barone (1908) === Barone, an associate of Pareto, proved an optimality property of perfect competition,E. Barone, \u2018Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Colletivistica\u2019 (1908). namely that \u2013 assuming exogenous prices \u2013 it maximises the monetary value of the return from productive activity, this being the sum of the values of leisure, savings, and goods for consumption, all taken in the desired proportions.In fact he divides this value by the price of an arbitrarily chosen item, but since prices are assumed fixed this merely introduces an irrelevant asymmetry. He makes no argument that the prices chosen by the market are themselves optimal. His paper wasn\u2019t translated into English until 1935. It received an approving summary from SamuelsonP. A. Samuelson, \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), pp. 214\u2013217. but seems not to have influenced the development of the welfare theorems as they now stand. === Abba Lerner (1934) === In 1934 Lerner restated Edgeworth\u2019s condition for exchange that indifference curves should meet as tangents, presenting it as an optimality property. He stated a similar condition for production, namely that the production\u2013possibility frontier (PPF, to which he gave the alternative name of \u2018productive indifference curve\u2019) should be tangential with an indifference curve for the community. He was one of the originators of the PPF, having used it in a paper on international trade in 1932.A. Lerner, \u2018The Diagrammatical Representation of Cost Conditions in International Trade\u2019 (1932), cited in Thomas M. Humphrey, \u2018The Trade Theorist\u2019s Sacred Diagram: its Origin and Early Development\u2019 (1988). He shows that the two arguments can be presented in the same terms, since the PPF plays the same role as the mirror-image indifference curve in an Edgeworth box. He also mentions that there\u2019s no need for the curves to be differentiable, since the same result obtains if they touch at pointed corners. His definition of optimality was equivalent to Pareto\u2019s: > If... it is possible to move one individual into a preferred position > without moving another individual into a worse position... we may say that > the relative optimum is not reached... The optimality condition for production is equivalent to the pair of requirements that (i) price should equal marginal cost and (ii) output should be maximised subject to (i). Lerner thus reduces optimality to tangency for both production and exchange, but does not say why the implied point on the PPF should be the equilibrium condition for a free market. Perhaps he considered it already sufficiently well established.Eg. \u2018Nothing but prime cost [ie. marginal cost] enters necessarily and directly into the supply price for short periods\u2019: Alfred Marshall, \u2018Principles of Economics\u2019, V.v.6 (eighth ed. consulted). And cf. Knut Wicksell\u2019s \u2018provisional conclusion that free competition is normally a sufficient condition to ensure maximization of production\u2019, \u2018Lectures on Political Economy\u2019 I (1906), Eng. tr. (1934), p. 141. If so, he was relying on a fairly strong premise.Arguably stronger than his conclusion. A remarkable feature of his paper is its lack of reference to earlier economists. He ascribes to his LSE colleague Victor Edelberg the credit for suggesting the use of indifference curves. Samuelson surmised that Lerner obtained his results independently of Pareto\u2019s work.P. A. Samuelson, \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), p. 217. === Harold Hotelling (1938) === Hotelling put forward a new argument to show that \u2018sales at marginal costs are a condition of maximum general welfare\u2019 (under Pareto\u2019s definition). He accepted that this condition was satisfied by perfect competition, but argued in consequence that perfect competition could not be optimal since some beneficial projects would be unable to recoup their fixed costs by charging at this rate.H. Hotelling, \u2018The General Welfare Problem in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility rates\u2019 (1938), Econometrica, pp. 260, 267. === Oscar Lange (1942) === Lange\u2019s paper \u2018The Foundations of Welfare Economics\u2019 is the source of the now-traditional pairing of two theorems, one governing markets, the other distribution. He justified the Pareto definition of optimality for the first theorem by reference to Lionel Robbins\u2019s rejection of interpersonal utility comparisons,\u2018All that part of the theory of Public Finance which deals with \u201cSocial Utility\u201d goes by the board\u2019: L. Robbins, \u2018An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science\u2019 (1932), p. 125\\. J. A. King commented that \u2018This defence of privilege required an unconvincingly solipsistic approach to the problem of comparing the states of mind of different individuals...\u2019 (\u2018Nicholas Kaldor\u2019 (2009), quoted in a 2011 review by Harvey Gram). and suggested various ways to reintroduce interpersonal comparisons for the second theorem such as the adjudications of a democratically elected Congress. His reasoning is a mathematical translation (into Lagrange multipliers) of Lerner\u2019s graphical argument. The second theorem does not take its familiar form in his hands; rather he simply shows that the optimisation conditions for a genuine social utility function are similar to those for Pareto optimality. === Abram Bergson and Paul Samuelson (1947) === Samuelson (crediting Abram Bergson for the substance of his ideas) brought Lange\u2019s second welfare theorem to approximately its modern form.P. A. Samuelson, \u2018Foundations of Economic Analysis\u2019 (1947), pp. 219\u2013249. He follows Lange in deriving a set of equations which are necessary for Pareto optimality, and then considers what additional constraints arise if the economy is required to satisfy a genuine social welfare function, finding a further set of equations from which it follows \u2018that all of the action necessary to achieve a given ethical desideratum may take the form of lump sum taxes or bounties\u2019.p. 245. The term \u2018lump-sum\u2019 here is obscure. A lump sum is a one-off payment; a lump sum tax is a per capita tax; but he can mean neither of these things since he says that \u2018it is not really easy to devise in practice a tax or subsidy which is of a purely lump-sum character'.p. 247. He seems to understand a lump sum as an impossible hybrid which has the distributional properties of a transfer without any distortionary consequences. === Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu (separately, 1951) === Arrow\u2019s and Debreu\u2019s two papersK. Arrow, \u2018An Extension of the Basic Theorems of Classical Welfare Economics\u2019 (1951); G. Debreu, \u2018The Coefficient of Resource Utilization\u2019 (1951). (written independently and published almost simultaneously) sought to improve on the rigour of Lange\u2019s first theorem. Their accounts refer to (short-run) production as well as exhange, expressing the conditions for both through linear functions. Equilibrium for production is expressed by the constraint that the value of a manufacturer\u2019s net output, ie. the dot product of the production vector with the price vector, should be maximised over the manufacturer\u2019s production set. This is interpreted as profit maximisation. A firm\u2019s maximum output, like that of an economy as a whole, will be attained only if an invisible hand leads employees, each seeking his or her own satisfaction, to promote an end which is no part of their intention; so like Lerner, Arrow and Debreu relied on a powerful premise (in their case embodied in definitions) to do much of the work. Equilibrium for exchange is interpreted as meaning that the individual\u2019s utility should be maximised over the positions obtainable from the endowment through exchange, these being the positions whose value is no greater than the value of his or her endowment, where the value of an allocation is its dot product with the price vector. The concept of equilibrium is thus recast as meaning optimality along a straight price line. This new meaning is given the special name of \u2018Walrasian\u2019 or \u2018competitive equilibrium\u2019, and is not a true equilibrium condition in the sense of being a balance of forces. Arrow\u2019s and Debreu\u2019s proofs required a change of mathematical style from the calculus to convex set theory. Arrow motivated his paper by reference to the need to extend proofs to cover equilibria at the edge of the space, and Debreu by the possibility of indifference curves being non-differentiable. Modern texts follow their style of proof. === Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995) === Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael Whinston and Jerry Green wrote a textbookMas-Colell et al., \u2018Microeconomic Theory\u2019 (1995 and subsequent editions). which is nowadays the standard reference for the fundamental theorems. In it they recast the Bergson\u2013Samuelson second theorem into the Arrow\u2013Debreu formalism, introducing a requirement that the desired end state should be a \u2018competitive equilibrium\u2019 \u2013 a condition previously absent which excludes some Pareto optima in the case that indifference curves may be non-convex.They partially redress this limitation in their Proposition 16.G.1 (for which they give no proof). It relies on yet another definition of equilibrium bringing calculus concepts back into consideration. Their account is notable for its authors\u2019 depreciation of the second theorem (described as serving \u2018a cautionary purpose\u2019 Mas-Colell et al, op. cit., p 557.) and the weight they attach to the first: > The first fundamental welfare theorem provides... a formal expression of > Adam Smith\u2019s \u2018invisible hand\u2019... Under perfectly competitive conditions... > the only possible welfare justification for intervention in the economy is > the fulfillment of distributional objectives.Mas-Colell et al, op. cit., p > 524. == Proof of the first fundamental theorem == The first fundamental theorem holds under general conditions. A formal statement is as follows: If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if (\\mathbf{X^*},\\mathbf{Y^*}, \\mathbf{p}) is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation (\\mathbf{X^*},\\mathbf{Y^*})is Pareto optimal. An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets. Given a set G of types of goods we work in the real vector space over G, \\mathbb{R}^{G} and use boldface for vector valued variables. For instance, if G=\\lbrace \\text{butter}, \\text{cookies}, \\text{milk} \\rbrace then \\mathbb{R}^{G} would be a three dimensional vector space and the vector \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle would represent the bundle of goods containing one unit of butter, 2 units of cookies and 3 units of milk. Suppose that consumer i has wealth w_i such that \\Sigma_i w_i = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{e} + \\Sigma _j \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{y^*_j} where \\mathbf{e} is the aggregate endowment of goods (i.e. the sum of all consumer and producer endowments) and \\mathbf{y^*_j} is the production of firm j. Preference maximization (from the definition of price equilibrium with transfers) implies (using >_i to denote the preference relation for consumer i): ::if \\mathbf{x_i} >_i \\mathbf{x^*_i} then \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} > \\mathbf{w_i} In other words, if a bundle of goods is strictly preferred to \\mathbf{x^*_i} it must be unaffordable at price \\mathbf{p}. Local nonsatiation additionally implies: ::if \\mathbf{x_i} \\geq _i \\mathbf{x^*_i} then \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} \\geq \\mathbf{w_i} To see why, imagine that \\mathbf{x_i} \\geq _i \\mathbf{x^*_i} but \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} < w_i. Then by local nonsatiation we could find \\mathbf{x'_i} arbitrarily close to \\mathbf{x_i} (and so still affordable) but which is strictly preferred to \\mathbf{x^*_i}. But \\mathbf{x^*_i} is the result of preference maximization, so this is a contradiction. An allocation is a pair (\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y}) where \\mathbf{X} \\in \\Pi_{i \\in I} \\mathbb{R}^{G} and \\mathbf{Y} \\in \\Pi_{j \\in J} \\mathbb{R}^{G} , i.e. \\mathbf{X} is the 'matrix' (allowing potentially infinite rows/columns) whose ith column is the bundle of goods allocated to consumer i and \\mathbf{Y} is the 'matrix' whose jth column is the production of firm j. We restrict our attention to feasible allocations which are those allocations in which no consumer sells or producer consumes goods which they lack, i.e.,for every good and every consumer that consumers initial endowment plus their net demand must be positive similarly for producers. Now consider an allocation (\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y}) that Pareto dominates (\\mathbf{X^*}, Y^*). This means that \\mathbf{x_i} \\geq _i \\mathbf{x^*_i} for all i and \\mathbf{x_i} >_i \\mathbf{x^*_i} for some i. By the above, we know \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} \\geq w_i for all i and \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} > w_i for some i. Summing, we find: ::\\Sigma _i \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} > \\Sigma _i w_i = \\Sigma _j \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{y^*_j}. Because \\mathbf{Y^*} is profit maximizing, we know \\Sigma _j \\mathbf{p} \\cdot y^*_j \\geq \\Sigma _j p \\cdot y_j , so \\Sigma _i \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x_i} > \\Sigma _j \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{y_j}. But goods must be conserved so \\Sigma _i \\mathbf{x_i} > \\Sigma _j \\mathbf{y_j}. Hence, (\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{Y}) is not feasible. Since all Pareto-dominating allocations are not feasible, (\\mathbf{X^*},\\mathbf{Y^*}) must itself be Pareto optimal. Note that while the fact that \\mathbf{Y^*} is profit maximizing is simply assumed in the statement of the theorem the result is only useful/interesting to the extent such a profit maximizing allocation of production is possible. Fortunately, for any restriction of the production allocation \\mathbf{Y^*} and price to a closed subset on which the marginal price is bounded away from 0, e.g., any reasonable choice of continuous functions to parameterize possible productions, such a maximum exists. This follows from the fact that the minimal marginal price and finite wealth limits the maximum feasible production (0 limits the minimum) and Tychonoff's theorem ensures the product of these compacts spaces is compact ensuring us a maximum of whatever continuous function we desire exists. == Proof of the second fundamental theorem == The second theorem formally states that, under the assumptions that every production set Y_j is convex and every preference relation \\geq _i is convex and locally nonsatiated, any desired Pareto- efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibria with transfers. The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi- equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium. Let us define a price quasi- equilibrium with transfers as an allocation (x^*,y^*), a price vector p, and a vector of wealth levels w (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with \\Sigma _i w_i = p \\cdot \\omega + \\Sigma _j p \\cdot y^*_j (where \\omega is the aggregate endowment of goods and y^*_j is the production of firm j) such that: ::i. p \\cdot y_j \\leq p \\cdot y_j^* for all y_j \\in Y_j (firms maximize profit by producing y_j^*) ::ii. For all i, if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\cdot x_i \\geq w_i (if x_i is strictly preferred to x_i^* then it cannot cost less than x_i^*) ::iii. \\Sigma_i x_i^* = \\omega + \\Sigma _j y_j^* (budget constraint satisfied) The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement (ii). The inequality is weak here (p \\cdot x_i \\geq w_i) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium. Define V_i to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to x_i^* by consumer i, and let V be the sum of all V_i. V_i is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation \\geq _i. V is convex because every V_i is convex. Similarly Y + \\\\{\\omega\\\\}, the union of all production sets Y_i plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every Y_i is convex. We also know that the intersection of V and Y + \\\\{\\omega\\\\} must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to (x^*,y^*) by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of (x^*,y^*). These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the separating hyperplane theorem. This theorem states that there exists a price vector p eq 0 and a number r such that p \\cdot z \\geq r for every z \\in V and p \\cdot z \\leq r for every z \\in Y + \\\\{\\omega\\\\}. In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets. Next we argue that if x_i \\geq _i x_i^* for all i then p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i) \\geq r. This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle x'_i arbitrarily close to x_i that is strictly preferred to x_i^* and hence part of V_i, so p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x'_i) \\geq r. Taking the limit as x'_i \\rightarrow x_i does not change the weak inequality, so p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i) \\geq r as well. In other words, x_i is in the closure of V. Using this relation we see that for x_i^* itself p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i^*) \\geq r. We also know that \\Sigma _i x_i^* \\in Y + \\\\{\\omega\\\\}, so p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i^*) \\leq r as well. Combining these we find that p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r. We can use this equation to show that (x^*,y^*,p) fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Because p \\cdot (\\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r and \\Sigma _i x_i^* = \\omega + \\Sigma _j y_j^* we know that for any firm j: ::p \\cdot (\\omega + y_j + \\Sigma_h y_h^*) \\leq r = p \\cdot (\\omega + y_j^* + \\Sigma_h y_h^*) for h eq j which implies p \\cdot y_j \\leq p \\cdot y_j^*. Similarly we know: ::p \\cdot (x_i + \\Sigma_k x_k^*) \\geq r = p \\cdot (x_i^* + \\Sigma_k x_k^*) for k eq i which implies p \\cdot x_i \\geq p \\cdot x_i^*. These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels w_i = p \\cdot x_i^* for all i. We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement \"if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\cdot x_i \\geq w_i\" imples \"if x_i >_i x_i^* then p \\cdot x_i > w_i\". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set X_i is convex and the preference relation \\geq _i is continuous. Then, if there exists a consumption vector x'_i such that x'_i \\in X_i and p \\cdot x'_i < w_i, a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium. To see why, assume to the contrary x_i >_i x_i^* and p \\cdot x_i = w_i, and x_i exists. Then by the convexity of X_i we have a bundle x_i = \\alpha x_i + (1 - \\alpha)x'_i \\in X_i with p \\cdot x_i < w_i. By the continuity of \\geq _i for \\alpha close to 1 we have \\alpha x_i + (1 - \\alpha)x'_i >_i x_i^*. This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to x_i^* and costs less than w_i. Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a \"cheaper\" consumption bundle x'_i. One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels w_i to be strictly positive for all consumers i. ==The Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem== A paper by Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz advances a partial converse to the first fundamental theorem.Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz, \u2018Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets\u2019 (1986). > It establishes a conceptual parallel between asymmetric information and > technological externalities, and shows that a competitive equilibrium of an > economy with asymmetric information is generically not even constrained > Pareto efficient.
