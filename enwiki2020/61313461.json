    "text": "Arctic Dogs (also known as Arctic Justice or Polar Squad in the UK) is a 2019 computer-animated comedy film co-written and directed by Aaron Woodley and co- directed by Dimos Vrysellas. The film stars the voices of Jeremy Renner, Heidi Klum, James Franco, John Cleese, Omar Sy, Michael Madsen, Laurie Holden, Anjelica Huston, and Alec Baldwin. The film was released on November 1, 2019 by Entertainment Studios in Canada and the United States. It was a box-office bomb, grossing just $9 million against a production budget of $50 million, and was panned by critics for its clich\u00e9d story and immature humor. ==Plot== Swifty the Arctic Fox (Jeremy Renner) works in the mailroom of the Arctic Blast Delivery Service, but he has much bigger dreams. He yearns to become a Top Dog, the Arctic's star husky couriers. To prove he can do it, he commandeers one of the sleds and delivers a mysterious package to a secret location. Once there, he stumbles on a hidden fortress overseen by the nefarious Otto Von Walrus (John Cleese). The blubbery evil genius commands an army of oddly polite puffin henchmen. Swifty discovers Otto Von Walrus' villainous plan to drill beneath the snow-packed surface to unleash masses of ancient gas to melt the Arctic and become the world's supreme ruler. To stop this sinister scheme, Swifty enlists the help of his friends: Polar bear (Alec Baldwin), a neurotic polar bear, Lemmy (James Franco), a scatterbrained albatross, Jade Fox (Heidi Klum), a brainy red fox engineer, Leopold (Omar Sy) and Bertha (also voiced by Heidi Klum), two conspiracy theorist otters and Magda (Anjelica Huston), his curmudgeonly caribou boss. ==Voice cast== *Jeremy Renner as Swifty, an Arctic fox who is the main protagonist. *Alec Baldwin as PB, an introverted polar bear and Swifty's best friend. *Heidi Klum as Jade, a tough-as-nails red fox mechanic and Swifty's love interest. **Klum also voices Bertha, a German-accented conspiracy theorist otter. *John Cleese as Otto Van Walrus, a British-accented walrus and the main antagonist. *Anjelica Huston as Magda, a formally short-tempered Russian-accented caribou and Swifty's boss. *James Franco as Lemmy, a scatterbrained albatross. *Omar Sy as Leopold, a French-accented conspiracy theorist otter. *Michael Madsen as Duke, a Husky employed by Arctic Blast Delivery Service. *Laurie Holden as Dakota, another Husky employed by the Arctic Blast Delivery Service. *Donny Falsetti as Dusty, another Husky employed by the Arctic Blast Delivery Service. *Nina Senicar as Countdown Inka, the countdown voice of Otto's machine. *Aaron Woodley as Puffins, Otto Van Walrus' henchmen.
