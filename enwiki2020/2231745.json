On May 15, 2014, in the bottom of the 9th inning, Iba\u00f1ez hit game- tying three run home run off of New York Mets pitcher Jos\u00e9 Valverde, in which the Angels lost by a solo home run by Anthony Recker, later in the game, by a final score of 6-7. On June 21, the Angels released Iba\u00f1ez. In 57 games with the Angels, Iba\u00f1ez hit .157 with 3 home runs and 21 RBIs. ===Second stint with the Royals (2014)=== On June 30, the Kansas City Royals signed Iba\u00f1ez. On July 2, he hit his first home run of the season. With the team struggling with a 48-50 win-loss record on July 21, following comments by manager Ned Yost that the team needed to improve its play, Iba\u00f1ez led a players-only meeting, which players including Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain credited with turning around the attitudes of the players. The Royals then won 24 of their next 30, secured a wild card berth, and reached the 2014 World Series, losing to the San Francisco Giants. Iba\u00f1ez was not on the Royals' postseason roster, except for the Wild Card Game, in which he did not appear. Having interviewed for the Tampa Bay's managerial position vacated by Joe Maddon, the club named Iba\u00f1ez as one of three finalists on November 21, 2014.
