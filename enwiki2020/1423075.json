    "text": "Aristarchus or Aristarch of Tegea (, Aristarkhos ho Tegeates) was a Greek tragic poet and a contemporary of Sophocles and Euripides. He lived to be a centenarian, composed seventy plays, and won two tragic victories. Only the titles of three of his plays (Achilles, Asclepius, and Tantalus), along with a single line of the text, have come down to us, although Ennius freely borrowed from his play about Achilles. Among his merits seems to have been that of brevity; for, as Suidas relates, he was \"the first one to make his plays of the present length.\"Suda \u03b1 3893 ==References== ==External links== *Ancient Library Category:Ancient Arcadian poets Category:Tragic poets Category:5th- century BC Greek people Category:Ancient Greek centenarians Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights Category:5th-century BC writers Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Tegea ",
