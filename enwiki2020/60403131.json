However, his road through the academy system was not cut and dried. Rodriguez was actually rejected the first time he tried to join the FC Dallas academy. After this rejection, Rodriguez played for FC Dallas youth coach Victor Medina outside of the FC Dallas academy for three years. His career took off when Rodriguez starred for his club against professional youth sides from Mexico, like C.D. Guadalajara and Club Le\u00f3n. From that point, Rodriguez signed for FC Dallas's academy in 2017. He helped the club win the prestigious Dallas Cup during his time with the academy. === Professional === On January 31, 2019, Rodriguez signed his first professional contract with North Texas SC, the reserve team of FC Dallas, in USL League One. Rodriguez's younger brother, David Rodriguez, was also signed to a professional contract with the club. Rodriguez made his debut on March 30, 2019 in a 3-2 win against the Chattanooga Red Wolves. Rodriguez helped lead North Texas to the USL League One 2019 regular season and post- season championship, while becoming the league's assist leader with 10 assists and a leading MVP candidate. On October 31 and November 1, respectively, Rodriguez was named both the Young Player of the Year and the League's Most Valuable Player (MVP). He scored his first goal for the club on November 5, 2019 against fellow MLS reserve side Orlando City B. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|US Open Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Play-offs !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|North Texas |2019 |rowspan=\"2\"|USL League One |28||7||0||0||2||1||30||8 |- |2020 |3||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !31!!7!!0!!0!!2!!1!!33!!8 |- |Real Monarchs (loan) |2020 |USL Championship |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !33!!7!!0!!0!!2!!1!!35!!8 |} == Honors == ===Club=== North Texas SC *USL League One Regular season: 2019 *USL League One Play-offs: 2019 ====Individual==== *USL League One Most Valuable Player: 2019 *USL League One Young Player of the Year: 2019 ==References== ==External links== * * Arturo Rodriguez at FC Dallas Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Mexican footballers Category:Mexican emigrants to the United States Category:Association football midfielders Category:North Texas SC players Category:Real Monarchs players Category:Soccer players from Texas Category:USL League One players ",
