The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTF. \"Elle \u00e9tait si jolie\" became a major domestic hit and served to launch Barri\u00e8re into stardom in Francophone music markets. The song has never lost its popularity and remains a universally known French standard, although most are unaware of its Eurovision origin. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Barri\u00e8re performed 11th in the running order, following Switzerland and preceding Spain.
