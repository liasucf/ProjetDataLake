He is one of Azerbaijan's internationally known contemporary artists and serves as his country's Ambassador For Peace. People\u2019s Artist of Azerbaijan Republic. Professor at Azerbaijani State University of Art and Culture. == Life == Arif Aziz was born in Baku in 1943, where he lives and works. He studied at first, between 1957 and 1962, at the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Art. He then studied graphic design in Moscow for five years. Since the early 1970s he teaches fine arts at the country's art schools. In 2005 he took the chair of painting at Beykent University in Istanbul, Turkey, which he held until 2007. After that he became Dean of the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Art. == Works == When Aziz initially began painting he had to follow the teachings of socialist realism, which required that he paint glorified depictions of communist values. Despite this restriction he found a way to go around the restrictions of Soviet times and painted attractions, cities, and landscapes of his homeland in a figurative art style. In his art Aziz also combines the human face with traditional ornaments from his homeland, as well as influences gathered during travels to Africa, Moscow, Paris, Turkey and India. Aziz is credited as helping to shape a school of abstractionism that has impacted many young Azerbaijanian artists. == Collections and public exhibitions== ===Public collections === Works by Arif Aziz can be found in the following collections: * Azerbaijan Carpet Museum in Baku * Baku Museum of Modern Art * Moscow Museum of Modern Art * Senegal State Art Museum in Dakar ===Exhibitions (selected)=== The following are selected exhibits where Aziz' work has been displayed as either a solo work or as part of a main group exhibition. * solo show: Spirituelle Komposition, Kunsthalle Dresden 2015 * solo show: Dance of Spirit, Galerie Michael Schultz, Berlin 2015 * solo show: Danamik und Symbolik, Kunsthalle Messmer, Riegel (Germany) 2015 * group show: Yeni Era, 11, World Art Academy Exhibition, Baku Museum of Modern Art 2014 * solo show: RTR Gallery, Paris 2013 * group show: Central House of Artists, Moscow 2011 * group show: Turkish Days in Azerbaijan, Baku 2008 == Bibliography == * Arif Aziz: Dance of Spirit, (exhibition catalogue, edd. by Kunsthalle Messmer, Galerie Michael Schultz, Kunsthalle Dresden), Berlin 2015 * Arsalan Mohammed und Hans Bussert, From Baku to Berlin, in: SLEEK \u2013 THE VISUAL CONTEMPORARY, Spring 2015, Berlin 2015, pp. 84\u201391 == References == == External links == * * Arif Aziz at the World Academy of the Arts, Baku * Gallery representation at Michael Schultz Gallery, Berlin, Seoul, Beijing Category:Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts alumni Category:1943 births Category:Contemporary painters Category:Living people Category:Artists from Baku Category:Azerbaijani expatriates in Turkey Category:Beykent University faculty ",
