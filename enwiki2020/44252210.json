    "text": "H & R Block Ltd v Sanott [1976] 1 NZLR 213 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the legality of restraint of trade clauses under the Illegal Contracts Act 1970. ==Background== Sanott was employed as a manager of H & R Block's Christchurch office. After a falling out between them, Sannott resigned and set up in competition to them. H & R Block sought to enforce his restraint of trade clause excluding him for operating within 25 miles of their Christchurch office for the next 5 years. ==Held== The court found the restraint of trade clause was unreasonable, and modified it to excluding operating within 5 miles, for 3 years. Somers J said \"The provisions of s 8 were intended to overcome the annihilating effect of the common law rules about excessive restraints and to alter those rules as to severance\". ==See also== * Illegal Contracts Act 1970 ==References== Category:High Court of New Zealand cases Category:New Zealand contract case law Category:1975 in case law Category:1975 in New Zealand law Category:H&R; Block ",
