    "text": "Chords Of Fame was a 2-LP compilation of folksinger Phil Ochs' career, compiled by his brother shortly after Ochs' death in 1976. Released on A&M; Records, it compiled tracks Ochs had recorded for both that label and Elektra Records. The compilation included several rarities: *An electric version of \"I Ain't Marching Anymore\", released as a single in the UK in 1966 *Both sides of a 1974 single: **\"Power and the Glory\", recorded with a fife and drum corps **\"Here's to the State of Richard Nixon\", a revision of \"Here's to the State of Mississippi\", taped live at Max's Kansas City *An acoustic version of \"Crucifixion\" recorded at Carnegie Hall on March 27, 1970, at the show that had produced Gunfight at Carnegie Hall The three singles had not been available previously on any album. As with many compilations, favoritism abounds on the album. Seven tracks from Ochs' third album and four from his first appear, while only one song each is included from his second and fifth albums. No tracks from Ochs' seventh album are included, and his remaining albums are represented by two or three songs apiece. With the exception of the 1997 box set, never again would Elektra material be released on A&M;, or vice versa. ==Track listing== All songs by Phil Ochs unless otherwise noted.
