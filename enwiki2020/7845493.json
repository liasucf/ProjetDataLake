The company is also the single largest grower of mangoes in Pakistan, and employs roughly 1,000 persons. The company is best known for its trademark product, 'Shezan Mango', a mango juice drink popular in Pakistan. ==History== Shezan International was incorporated on May 13, 1964; conceived as a joint venture by the Shahnawaz Group, Pakistan and Alliance Industrial Development Corporation, United States in 1964. ==Production== Shezan remains amongst Pakistan's largest food processing units, having developed and installed the capacity to meet the country's local as well as export needs. In 1971, Shahnawaz Group purchased all the shares of Alliance Industrial Development Corporation with the permission of the Government of Pakistan. In 1980\u201381, a separate unit was installed in Karachi, which now caters for Karachi, Sindh and export demand. A bottle filling plant was set in 1983 in Lahore, Punjab. An independent Tetra Brik plant was commissioned in 1987. In 1990, it was decided to install a juice factory at Hattar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

In Canada, Target Foods is authorized distributor. In Bangladesh,Sajeeb foods is authorized distributor for all Shezan products. ==Products== Near the end of 2008, Shezan introduced an energy drink brand to Pakistan. ==Controversy== Shezan has been the frequent target of controversy due to the Ahmadi affiliation of its owners. Several campaigns led by religious conservatives have in the past targeted Shezan, calling for its boycott, and subsequent ban. ===Shezan products ban=== In 2012, campaigns by traditionally conservative Islamic groups found a more liberal voice, amongst these were lawyers from Lahore Bar Association. Soon thereafter, The Lahore Bar Association also banned Shezan products from its premises and subordinate court complexes, threatening tough actions against anyone found buying the drink. The move came as 100 lawyers unanimously voted for the ban on Shezan drinks and products. ===Attacks=== As a consequence of the numerous initiatives to boycott Shezan products in systematic Anti- Ahmadiyya campaigns, several attacks have been recorded against Shezan factories. In June 2010, unidentified assailants stormed a Shezan factory after which high-explosive bombs were detonated that left four injured. == References == == External links == * Shezan International Limited * Shezan at cititraders.co.uk Category:Pakistani drinks Category:Pakistani brands Category:Food and drink companies established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Pakistan Category:Desi cuisine Category:Drink companies of Pakistan Category:Ahmadiyya in Pakistan Category:Companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange ",
