    "text": "Norman M. Klein is an American urban and media historian, as well as an author of fictional works.Ben Ehrenreich. \"Old Haunts Revisited.\"The Los Angeles Times. July 2, 2006. In 2011, the Los Angeles Times put Klein's 1997 book The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory on its \"Best L.A. Books\" list.Christopher Reynolds. \"The Best L.A. Books? Let's Make a List (Part 2, nonfiction).\"The Los Angeles Times. October 4, 2011. Since 1974, Klein has been a professor in the School of Critical Studies at the California Institute of the Arts, where he is on the faculty of both the Master's Program in Aesthetics and Politics and the Center for Integrated Media. As layered systems that resemble certain genres of games and other media narrative formats, Klein's novels primarily offer literary alternatives. Having coined the term \"scripted space\" in 1998, Klein (with Margo Bistis) coined \"Wunder roman\" in 2012 to characterize a particular kind of picaresque novel whose parts function as a narrative engine. In 2004, the Beall Center for Art and Technology organized a retrospective of Klein's work. ==Early life and career== Born in Brooklyn, Klein grew up in an immigrant neighborhood where he regularly heard people tell stories that were partly true and partly not, which informed his view of people's personal histories.Interview with Hans- Ulrich Obrist. 2015. In 1966, he earned a B.A. in History at Brooklyn College and then went on to the University of Minnesota, where he earned an M.A. in French Intellectual History in 1968. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles, where he began teaching at California Institute of the Arts before earning his M. F. A. in Cinema and Professional Writing from the University of Southern California. Klein has been a professor in the School of Critical Studies at California Institute of the Arts for over four decades. ==Works (Books and Multi-media Projects)== * Tales of the Floating Class, Writings 1982-2017: Essays and Fictions on Globalization and Neo-Feudalism.
