St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1393. Located in western Watertown Township, about north of the community of Watertown, the bridge spans the South Branch of Wolf Creek near the intersection of State Route 339 and Township Road 172.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 81. . Among the bridge's more distinctive features are its cut stone abutments, its metal roof, and the vertical siding. Although it has been open for well over one hundred years, it remains in strong structural condition, and it served daily traffic into the late twentieth century. A single-span structure completed in 1875, the bridge was constructed under the leadership of Marietta bridge builder William Meredith. One of his primary employees was stonemason Billy Gamble, who used locally quarried stone to construct the abutments. The source for this stone was the farm of James Harrah, whose name (minus its final letter) was given to the bridge. The plan for the bridge used the Long truss design; fewer than ten historic Long truss bridges remain in Ohio today. In 1976, the Harra Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its importance in the history of Ohio., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.
