He specialized in the understanding of ophiolites (fragments of oceanic crust and mantle that have been emplaced onto the continental crust) and the geology of the continental crust of the Western United States and Tethyan belt, the geology of Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan, and the tectonic development of the Sierra Nevada and the Alpine - Himalayan systems. Moores was Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Geology at the University of California, Davis. In 1996, Moores was President of the Geological Society of America (GSA)GSA Past Leaders https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/About/Leadership/Past_Leaders/GSA/About/Past_Leaders.aspx and editor of the society's journal Geology from 1981 to 1989.

Twiss, Moores co-authored two textbooks: TectonicsTectonics, W. H. Freeman (1995); and Structural GeologyStructural Geology, Macmillan Higher Education (2006); Moores is the main subject of the John McPhee book on California geology, Assembling California (1993),Assembling California (1998); Farrar, Straus and Giroux / Macmillan (1993); as well as McPhee's Annals of the Former World (1998).Annals of the Former World, John McPhee; Farrar Straus & Giroux, New York, NY (1998); In 2013, Eldridge Moores was awarded the title of UC Davis distinguished professor emeritus.
