    "text": "Dammasch State Hospital was a mental hospital, asylum, and educational center located in Wilsonville, Oregon, United States. Named for Dr. Ferdinand H. Dammasch, the hospital opened in 1961 and closed in 1995. After its closure, the former site was embroiled in local controversy as it was a proposed location for a women's prison, which angered local residents as the site is less than a mile from residential neighborhoods. The Dammasch building was demolished, and the Villebois housing development occupies its former site. ==See also== * Callahan Center (later Living Enrichment Center) was contiguous to the hospital site and part of the larger development planning area. == References == ==External links== * Smith Eliot's images of Dammasch State Hospital * Slide show of Dammasch pictures from the Oregon State Archives * A Dammasch State Hospital tribute website with a collection of images, videos and stories * John Kloepper's images of Dammasch State Hospital Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1961 Category:Psychiatric hospitals in Oregon Category:Defunct hospitals in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Wilsonville, Oregon Category:Hospitals established in 1961 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Oregon Category:1961 establishments in Oregon Category:1995 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Hospitals disestablished in 1995 ",
