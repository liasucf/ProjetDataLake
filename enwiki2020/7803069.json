    "text": "Sir Richard Sheridan Franklin Bowling (born 26 February 1934), known as Frank Bowling, is a Guyana-born British artist. His paintings relate to Abstract expressionism, Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Bowling was born in Bartica, Guyana. His father was a police district paymaster and his mother a seamstress,Maya Jaggi, \"The weight of colour\", The Guardian, 24 February 2007. and in 1950, at the age of 19, Bowling moved to England, where he lived with an uncle and completed his education. After doing his National Service in the Royal Air Force, Bowling went on to study art, despite earlier ambitions to be a poet and a writer.Spencer A. Richards, Frank Bowling biography. He studied at the Chelsea School of Art, then in 1959 won a scholarship to London's Royal College of Art, where fellow students included artists such as David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Allen Jones, R. B. Kitaj and Peter Phillips. At graduation in 1962, Hockney was awarded the gold medal while Bowling was given the silver. Bowling had been tipped to win the gold but due to his controversial 1960 marriage to Royal College Registrar Paddy Kitchen (they divorced in the late 1960s),Ian Collins, \"Obituary: Paddy Kitchen\", The Guardian, 12 December 2005. he was relegated to silver. His first one-person exhibition, entitled Image in Revolt, was held in London in 1962 at the Grabowski Gallery, and other exhibitions followed. However, Bowling was frustrated at being pigeonholed as a Caribbean artist; as he said in a 2012 Guardian interview with Laura Barnett: \"It seemed that everyone was expecting me to paint some kind of protest art out of postcolonial discussion. For a while I fell for it. I painted a picture called the Martyrdom of Patrice Lumumba.\"Laura Barnett, \"Frank Bowling and the politics of abstract painting\", The Guardian, 2 July 2012. ===1960s\u2013present=== A move to New York in the mid-1960s exposed Bowling to his American contemporaries and soon won him a place in the 1971 Whitney Biennial. As Maya Jaggi writes: \"unlike contemporaries who founded British pop art, Bowling took a singular path, from Bacon-esque figurative painting to an abstract art touched by personal memory and history.... Encouraged by the US critic Clement Greenberg, he found a freedom in abstract art, alongside Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman.\" Between 1969 and 1972 Bowling was a contributing editor of Arts Magazine. Bowling now spends part of each year between London and New York, where he maintains studios.Spencer A. Richards, \"Frank Bowling\".
