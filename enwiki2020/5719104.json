Anarchisme, un \u00e9tat de r\u00e9volution permanente (1897\u20131908), \u00c9ditions Agone, 2006. (see also ). (24 November 1875 \u2013 12 November 1908) was an individualist anarchist militant and writer from France who edited the influential anarchist publication L\u2019Anarchie.\"Libertad (1875\u20131908)\" at marxists.org == Life and work == He was born in Bordeaux, and died in Paris. Abandoned by his parents as a baby, Libertad was a child of the Public Assistance in Bordeaux. As a result of a childhood illness, he lost the use of his legs,\"Libertad (1875\u20131908)\" at marxists.org but put his handicap to good use, using his crutches as weapons against the police. He moved to Paris at 21, where he soon became active in anarchist circles, going so far as to live in the offices of the journal \u201cLe Libertaire.\u201d A member of various anarchist groups, and a supporter of \u201cpropaganda by the deed,\u201d he was nevertheless an abstentionist candidate in Paris\u2019s 11th arrondissement in 1902 and 1904, seeing his candidacy as a means of spreading anarchist ideas. During the Dreyfus affair, he founded the Anti-Militarist League (1902) \"and, along with Paraf-Javal, founded the \u201cCauseries populaires\u201d, public discussions that met with great interest throughout the country, contributing to the opening of a bookstore and various clubs in different quarters of Paris\". In 1905, Libertad founded what was probably the most important individualist anarchist journal, L\u2019Anarchie, which included among its collaborators Andr\u00e9 Lorulot, Emile Armand, and Victor Serge and his companion Rirette Maitrejean. The French theorist of the Situationist International Raoul Vaneigem reports that Libertad gained notoriety for a call to action in which he \"invited citizens to burn their ID papers and to become humans again, refusing to let themselves be reduced to a number, duly filed in the statistic state inventories of slaves.\"http://www.noborderbxl.eu.org/spip.php?article282\u27e8=fr \"No borders no papers\" by Raoul Vaneigem He also worked as corrector with Aristide Briand, editing the review, La Lanterne, and then with S\u00e9bastien Faure. An activist of the free love, Libertad wrote in EnDehors, a famous newspaper founded by Zo d'Axa. == Anarchism == On the occasion of the July 14 anniversary, L\u2019Anarchie \"printed and distributed the manifesto \u201cThe Bastille of Authority\u201d in one hundred thousand copies. Along with feverish activity against the social order, Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the \u201cjoy of living\u201d and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. In fact, Libertad overcame the false dichotomy between individual revolt and social revolution, stressing that the first is simply a moment of the second, certainly not its negation. Revolt can only be born from the specific tension of the individual, which, in expanding itself, can only lead to a project of social liberation. For Libertad, anarchism doesn't consist in living separated from any social context in some cold ivory tower or on some happy communitarian isle, nor in living in submission to social roles, putting off the moment when one puts one's ideas into practice to the bitter end, but in living as anarchists here and now, without any concessions, in the only way possible: by rebelling. And this is why, in this perspective, individual revolt and social revolution no longer exclude each other, but rather complement each other.\" == See also == *Individualist anarchism in Europe ==Notes== * Albert Libertad, Le Culte de la charogne.
