    "text": "Elie-Jean-Joseph Morel (27 December 1862 - 15 June 1948) was a member of Paris Foreign Missions Society and was the archbishop of Archdiocese of Pondicherry. On 21 September 1909 he succeeded Archbishop Joseph-Adolphe Gandy. He was the bishop until 16 August 1929. He resigned due to health reasons. He was succeeded by Auguste-Sim\u00e9on Colas. ==Early life== He was born 27 December 1862 in Bellefontaine, diocese of Saint-Claude, Jura. He entered Paris Foreign Missions Society on 5 March 1885. He was ordained priest 24 September 1887. He left immediately for the Pondicherry Mission where he was appointed as Professor of Science at the Colonial College. Then, he was appointed as the parish priest of Thennur, where he made a relatively short stay. He was recalled to the College Saint Joseph at Cuddalore as Professor of science. He was forced to return to Pondicherry to replace the top of the Grand S\u00e9minaire, P. Faure, who, extremely tired, had to return to France. Mgr. Joseph-Adolphe Gandy, then archbishop of Pondicherry, realizing that his health was failing, had requested Rome to give him a Coadjutor. He died before getting a definitive answer. Six months after his death, Rome appointed Morel as his successor. ==As Bishop== Mgr. Morel received his episcopal consecration at the hands of Mgr. Hugues-Madelain Bottero, M.E.P., Bishop of Kumbakonam on 21 September 1909. At that time, High caste Christians of Pondicherry were, as revolt against the authority, did not participate in the consecration event. The reason for the revolt was that the out-castes (Parias) wanted equal rights and demanded the removal of segregation of seats which were reserved for high caste peoples by hereditary. This situation was very discouraging to the new bishop. Calm was restored only after 1913. During its years of episcopate Mgr. Morel worked specially, with the help of Fr. Gavan Duffy, to organize and to improve the training of teachers in the schools of the diocese, and to increase the vocation in the diocese. In 1914, at the outbreak of the first world war, some missionaries were mobilized, and several posts lost their incharge. Mgr. Morel did not hesitate to become parish priest himself and settled in Villupuram until the end of the war in 1918. After the war he resumed his Episcopal duties in Pondicherry which included visits to parishes, confirmations, consecration of new chapels, churches, opening schools etc. ==Resignation and Death== Tomb of Mgr. Elie-Jean-Joseph Morel But in 1919, he believed his duty to resign because of his health. He was suffering with cataract. Mgr. Auguste-Sim\u00e9on Colas succeeded him. Wanting to spend his time useful, he became chaplain of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny on the mountain of Yerkaud. This lasted a time, and he was forced to retire at St. Martha hospital, Bangalore, which was recently built by Mgr. Colas, for sick and aged missionaries. During the absence of Mgr. Despatures, Bishop of Bangalore, Mgr. Morel served by giving a few confirmations in the diocese. But his strength quickly declined and after receiving the last sacraments and after two days of agony, he died the l5 June l948, eighteen years after his resignation. His body was transferred to Pondicherry, where the funeral mass was said in the Cathedral. His body is buried next to his predecessor Mgr. Gandy, in the cemetery adjacent to Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Pondicherry. ==References== Category:1862 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Paris Foreign Missions Society missionaries Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:French Roman Catholic bishops in Asia Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Pondicherry and Cuddalore Category:People of French India Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in India ",
