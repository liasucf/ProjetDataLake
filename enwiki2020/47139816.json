    "text": "Orpheum in Vancouver The BC Entertainment Hall of Fame in Vancouver was founded on 24 July 1992 to honour British Columbians that have made outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Star Walk inductees are featured with a plaque on the Walk of Fame on Granville Street and in a Starwall gallery in the Orpheum. Individuals and organizations can be nominated and inducted. The City of Vancouver provides guided tours of the Orpheum and BC Entertainment Hall of Fame Starwall to which the proceeds go back into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame fund. The selection process can take several years from the time the nomination to when its given. Dorothy Davies was one of the first Star Walk inductees. ==Inductees== Dal Richards, founding inductee and Star Walk. * 1993 * 1994 - Dorothy Davies, * 1995 - Rosemary Deveson * 1996 * 1997 - Daryl Duke * 1998 - Vic Waters and Anna Wyman * 1999 * 2000 * 2001 - Judith Marcuse * 2002 - Christopher Gaze, Dee Daniels * 2003 - Choo Chiat and Lin Yee Goh, Terry David Mulligan * 2004 - Double Exposure, Antony Holland, Norma MacMillan, Randy Bachman * 2005 - Kathryn Shaw, John Drainie * 2006 - David Cooper, Michael Conway Baker * 2007 * 2008 * 2009 - Michael Bubl\u00e9, Wendy Gorling * 2010 - Bruce Greenwood, Bruce Kellett, Bruce Pullan, Susan Jacks, Dave Abbott, Donna Spencer, and Jon Washburn * 2011 * 2012 * 2013 - Judy Ginn and Jim Walchuk, Bramwell Tovey, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and Ann Watt. * 2014 - Leonard Schein, Spirit of the West * 2016 - Starwalk: Michael J.
