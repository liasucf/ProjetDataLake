It is a pilgrimage centre of Jains and other communities visiting temple of Jain deity, Ghantakarna Mahavir and Padmaprabhu Jain Temple. It was known as Madhupuri historically. ==History== Mahudi Jain Temple was established by Jain monk, Buddhisagar Suri in 1917 CE ( Magshar Sudi 6, Vikram Samvat 1974). There is an inscription in the Brahmi script of it. The foundation stone was laid in 1916 CE on land donated by Vadilal Kalidas Vora. He along with Punamchand Lallubhai Shah, Kankkuchand Narsidas Mehta and Himmatlal Hakamchand Mehta became trustees of a trust established to manage the temple. The 22-inch marble idol of Padmaprabh as a central deity was installed. The separate shrine dedicated to the protector deity, Ghantakarna Mahavir was also established. Guru Mandir, a shrine dedicated to Buddhisagar Suri was established later. ==Culture== Devotees offer sukhadi, a sweet to Ghantakarna Mahavir. After offering, it is consumed by devotees within the temple complex. Tradition forbids the carrying away of such offerings outside premises. Every year, on Kali Chaudas (the fourteenth day of the dark half of the month of Aso), thousands of devotees visit the temple to attend a religious ceremony, Havan. ==Gallery== File:Padmaprabh Swami Bhagwan.1.jpg|Padmaprabha image in the Jain temple File:Ghantakarna Mahavir - Maitrik Vora.jpg|Ghantakarna Mahavir File:Shri Vadilal Kalidas Vora.jpg|Vadilal Kalidas Vora who donated the land for temple File:Sukhdi..jpg|Sukhdi - sweet offered to Ghantakarna Mahavir ==See also== * Padampura * Vijapur ==References== ==External links== * Official website of Mahudi Jain temple Category:Jain temples in Gujarat Category:Gandhinagar district Category:20th-century Jain temples Category:M\u0101ru-Gurjara architecture ",
