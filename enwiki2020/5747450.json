    "text": "In mathematics, the Heronian mean H of two non-negative real numbers A and B is given by the formula: :H = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(A + \\sqrt{A B} +B \\right). It is named after Hero of Alexandria. ==Application in solid geometry== A square frustum, with volume equal to the height times the Heronian mean of the square areas The Heronian mean may be used in finding the volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone. The volume is equal to the product of the height of the frustum and the Heronian mean of the areas of the opposing parallel faces. ==Relation to other means== The Heronian mean of the numbers A and B is a weighted mean of their arithmetic and geometric means: : H = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{A+B}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\sqrt{A B}. == References == * * == External links == * Mean-Trapezoids Geometric comparison of some mathematical means Category:Means ",
