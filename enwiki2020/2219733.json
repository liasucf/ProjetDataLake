    "text": "The Peugeot 4007 is a compact crossover SUV, produced for the French automobile manufacturer Peugeot, between July 2007 to April 2012. The equivalent Citro\u00ebn badge engineered version was the C-Crosser. Both were produced by Mitsubishi in its Nagoya Plant in Okazaki, Japan, based on the 2005 Outlander. It was shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2007. Together, the 4007 and C-Crosser were the first Japan produced cars sold under any French brand. They had their sales target of 30,000 units per year. It was officially launched on 12 July 2007. They had been planned to be assembled, for Europe, in the factory that was built in the 1960s to assemble DAFs, now Mitsubishi's Nedcar plant in Born, Netherlands, but this was postponed indefinitely, when sales of the two models fell well below the target of 30,000 units. ==Engines== Peugeot 4007 Interior *2.2 L (2179 cc) DW12 HDi turbodiesel straight-4, 115 kW (156 PS), ; with a particulate filter and a six speed gearbox, and able to run on 30% biodiesel *2.0 L (1998 cc) 4B11 Petrol DOHC 16 valve I4, 147 PS (same engine as the Outlander) \u2014 for Russian market only *2.4 L 4B12 Petrol DOHC 16 valve MIVEC I4, 170 PS (same engine as the Outlander)http://www.peugeot- presse.de/download/pdf/Alle_Neuen_2007_Technik.pdf ==Models== There were three available trim levels for the Peugeot 4007, all featuring a 2.2 Hdi engine: *SE \u2014 The standard model, with alloy wheels, climate control, heated mirrors, power steering etc. *Sport XS \u2014 SE trim, plus leather seats and a telephone. *GT \u2014 SE trim, plus headlamp washers, CD multichanger, heated leather seats, telephone, etc. ==Sales and production== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\";\" |- align=\"center\" | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Year | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide Production | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide sales | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Notes |- |2007 | | align=\"center\" |6,300 | |- |2008 | | align=\"center\" |13,700 | |- |2009 | align=\"center\" |4,500 | align=\"center\" |9,400 | |- |2010 | align=\"center\" |9,000 | align=\"center\" |8,400 | |- |2011 | align=\"center\" |6,957 | align=\"center\" |7,387 |Total production reaches 46,658 units. |- |2012 | align=\"center\" |2,300 | align=\"center\" |2,700 |Total production reaches 49,000 units. |} ==References== ==External links== *Official international 4007 English website *4007 Unofficial infosite 4007 Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:2010s cars Category:Cars introduced in 2007 Category:VDL Nedcar vehicles ",
