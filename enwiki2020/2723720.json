Since 2002, residents had begun advocating the creation of a Wilshire Park historic district in order to prevent teardowns and to encourage residents to only make exterior changes to their homes consistent with the historical period and architectural style of those homes. Wilshire Park was granted an Interim Control Ordinance on November 13, 2006. Wilshire Park became the first neighborhood in Los Angeles history in which residents conducted and completed their own survey and analysis of each home and parcel, overseen by a professional architectural consulting group. This Survey of Historic Resources was completely self-funded, utilizing no funds from the city. The HPOZ was accomplished after years of door-to-door conversations about preservation, the circulation of a pro-HPOZ petition signed by the majority of residents, many outreach meetings involving panel discussions, frequent discussions of preservation in the neighborhood newsletter, dozens of mailings to residents, as well as a 2007 Home and Garden tour fund-raiser sponsored by affiliate neighborhood West Adams. In August, 2008, Wilshire Park Association hosted, at the National Register of Historic Places Art Deco landmark Wiltern Theater, a public meeting for all residents regarding the neighborhood's proposed designation as a Historic District known as a Los Angeles Historic Preservation Overlay Zone. City officials of the Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources held a forum as part of the event attended by over 120 residents at the landmark Ebell of Los Angeles. On November 13, 2008 Wilshire Park was officially designated as an Historic Preservation Overlay Zone. On October 20, 2010, the ordinance was amended to adopt the Wilshire Park Preservation Plan and establish an HPOZ Board shared with the newly adopted Windsor Village and Country Club Park HPOZs.Preservation.lacity.org: Wilshire Park Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ) In an effort to streamline the HPOZ process and to make the HPOZ program financially viable, the \"Triplets\" agreed to share an HPOZ Board and Preservation Plan, while retaining their own HPOZ ordinances, periods of significance, context statements and identity.Preservation.lacity.org: The Country Club Park - Wilshire Park - Windsor Village HPOZ Board (2010) In partnership with Hancock Park, the Wilshire Park Association successfully lobbied the city's planners to impose height limits and mandatory free parking on commercial buildings being constructed on the \"Park Mile\" in the Mid- Wilshire area, a stretch of Wilshire (between Highland and Wilton) that had been one of the last undeveloped parcels in Mid-Wilshire.
