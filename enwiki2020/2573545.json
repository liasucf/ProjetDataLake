Being a significant part of the South-Western Sydney Growth Area, Camden Council represents a rapidly growing region which is expected to house a large portion of Sydney's population growth over the coming decade. To the north are residential developments including Oran Park (8,000 homes) and Gregory Hills (2,600 homes), whilst to the south are further developments of the Elderslie estate. A Muslim group, the Quranic Society, made a development application in the Camden area for an 19 million Muslim school with the capacity for 1,200 students. In May 2008 the Council voted unanimously to reject the application. After reducing its proposal to a school catering for 900 students, the Quranic Society took its case to the Land and Environment Court. The application was met with significant community protest; and the application rejected by the Court on the grounds that the land chosen was suited to rural uses. ==Heritage listings== The Camden Council has a number of heritage sites, including: * Camden, 135 Argyle Street: Camden Post Office * Camden, Aerodrome Road, Cobbitty: Macquarie Grove * Camden, Exeter Street: Nant Gwylan and Garden * Camden South, Elizabeth Macarthur Avenue: Camden Park Estate and Belgenny Farm * Catherine Field, 1025 Camden Valley Way: Raby, Catherine Field * Cobbitty, 421 The Northern Road: Denbigh, Cobbitty * Gledswood Hills, 900 Camden Valley Way: Gledswood * Harrington Park, 1 Hickson Circuit: Harrington Park (homestead) * Harrington Park, 181 - 183 Northern Road: Orielton * Narellan, Camden Valley Way: Studley Park, Narellan * Narellan, Kirkham Lane: Camelot, Kirkham * Narellan, Kirkham Lane: Kirkham Stables * Oran Park, 112-130 Oran Park Drive: Oran Park (homestead) ==See also== * Local government areas of New South Wales ==References== == External links == * Camden Council website * Camden Advertiser website Category:Local government areas in Sydney Category:Macarthur (New South Wales) ",
