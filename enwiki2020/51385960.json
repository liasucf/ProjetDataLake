    "text": "The Mystery of the Villa Rose (French: Le myst\u00e8re de la villa rose) is a 1930 French mystery film directed by Ren\u00e9 Hervil and Louis Mercanton and starring L\u00e9on Mathot, Simone Vaudry, and Louis Baron fils.Crisp p.104 ==Production== The film is based on the novel At the Villa Rose by A.E.W. Mason. A separate English-language version At the Villa Rose was made by Twickenham Studios. The film's sets were designed by James A. Carter. Different sources disagree over where the French-language version was actually made, with one claim that it was produced at Twickenham as the first bilingual film in Britain.Richards p.41-42 Alternatively it is suggested that it was made at the newly established Courbevoie Studios in Paris, in which case it could lay a claim to be one of the earliest French sound films.Crisp p.104 Britain had converted to sound faster than France so several French filmmakers went to British studios to make films for release in France. Another French-language version of a Mason novel La Maison de la Fl\u00e9che, was also shot at Twickenham during the period. ==Cast== * L\u00e9on Mathot as Langeac * Simone Vaudry as Mado Dubreuil * Louis Baron fils as Le Maillan * H\u00e9l\u00e9na Manson as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vauquier * Georges P\u00e9clet as Mortagne * Alice Ael as Madame Dauvray * Jacques Henley as Le juge d'instruction * Dahlia as L'inconnue * Jean Mercanton as Le petit gar\u00e7on * Ren\u00e9 Montis as Le chauffeur == References == == Bibliography == * Crisp, C.G.
