She entered service in 1884 and was powered by sail and steam. She took an active role in mapping the northern Pacific Ocean and nearby seas as well as periodically being stationed in Chinese and Korean ports and protecting seal rookeries, principally from American poachers. She also took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion (1899\u20131901). Sivuch spent the winter of 1903-1904 iced in with the Royal Navy sloop-of-war and a United States Navy gunboat at Newchwang at the mouth of the Liao River on the Gulf of Pechili coast of Manchuria. The three vessels were there when the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904. When the ice broke up in the spring of 1904, Espiegle and the U.S. Navy gunboat left, but Sivuch remained. Newchwang and the Liao River were in Chinese territory, so initially the Russians disarmed Sivuch in recognition of Chinese neutrality, but as their concern over the possibility of a Japanese landing in the vicinity of Newchwang grew, they occupied the Newchwang area and rearmed Sivuch.Corbett, p. 273. Sivuch\u2032s presence at Newchwang and on the Liao River was a matter of concern to the Imperial Japanese Navy during the early months of the war. As Imperial Japanese Army forces advanced on Newchwang and the Liao River in the summer of 1904, her presence became a concern for Japanese ground forces as well.Corbett, p. 353. Imperial Japanese Army cavalry occupied Newchwang on 25 July 1904, and Sivuch withdrew up the Liao River accompanied by a flotilla of four armed steam launches.Corbett, p. 354. On 1 August 1904, an Imperial Japanese Navy force consisting of the gunboats Atago, Tsukushi, and Uji and a division of torpedo boats arrived at the mouth of the Liao River with orders to assist the Japanese Second Army in guarding the river and to destroy Sivuch and her accompanying launches if possible.Corbett, p. 363. With Sivuch trapped in the upper reaches of the river by superior Japanese forces, her crew scuttled her by blowing her up on 2 August 1904.Conway's 1860-1905, p. 200. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M.
