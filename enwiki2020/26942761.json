Producer Anca Puiu has described the plot as a \"crime story from a new perspective.\" It is the second installment in Puiu's planned suite \"Six Stories from the Outskirts of Bucharest\", the first being The Death of Mr. Lazarescu from 2005. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. ==Cast== * Cristi Puiu as Viorel * Clara Vod\u0103 as Gina * Valeria Seciu as Pusa * Gelu Colceag as Mr. Livinski * Lumini\u021ba Gheorghiu as Mioara Avram * Gigi Ifrim as neighbour * Lucian Ifrim * Carmela Culda * Ileana Puiu as Olguta ==Synopsis== The main character, Viorel, is divorced. He does not handle the divorce very well. In a car park, he murders the notary that represented his former wife, along with the woman who happens to be with the notary. He then murders his former in-laws. At the end, he turns himself in to the police, confessing to the murders. The film follows him as he prepares for the murders, buying the illegally made firing pins, taking a shower while pushing two fingers in his anus and purchasing a shotgun. ==Production== Production was led by the Romanian company Mandragora, and co-produced by France's Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Coproduction, Switzerland's Bord Cadre Films and Germany's Essential Filmproduktion. The total production budget was 2 million Euro, including 380,000 Euro from the Romanian National Center of Cinematography and 250,000 Euro from Eurimages. Puiu spent five months searching for an appropriate lead actor before deciding to cast himself. Since the role involved several driving scenes he had to get a driving licence before filming could begin. Filming took place between February and May 2009. ==See also== * Romanian New Wave ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010 films Category:Romanian films Category:Romanian-language films Category:Films directed by Cristi Puiu Category:Films set in Bucharest Category:Films about divorce ",
