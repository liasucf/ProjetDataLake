I Did It Again\", \"99 Problems\", \"Bye Bye Bye\", \"The Next Episode\" and \"Ride with Me\".

You know, Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott. All of these songs...Yeah, it just takes me back to that time.\" In a March 2017 interview, she mentioned Alanis Morissette as a big influence on her while growing up.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04xsg04 == Composition == \"2002\" is originally in the key of E major with a tempo of 96 beats per minute and a time signature of .
