    "text": "Voikovo prison camp, or Camp No. 48, was a prisoner-of-war and internee camp maintained by the Main Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees of the NKVD in the Soviet Union. The camp was designated by the Soviet authorities for the high-ranking officers of the German Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS and was unofficially known as the \"Generals camp\". The camp was situated near the city of Ivanovo, Russian SFSR and was in operation from 1943 to 1955 when the last prisoners were repatriated to East Germany. The camp was located in an old inn and health spa and, although at times overcrowded, was dubbed \"the Castle\" for its relative luxury. ==Select prisoners held at the camp== *Wilhelm Mohnke *Friedrich Paulus *Arthur Schmidt *Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach *Louis Tronnier (\u2020 1952) ==References== * * ==Further reading == * Category:World War II prisoner of war camps .
