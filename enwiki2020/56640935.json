She became the first female minister in the Faroe Islands when she was appointed Minister of Finance, Economy and the Environment in 1985. In 1989, she was appointed Minister of the Economy, Social Affairs and the Judiciary, serving until 1991. ==Biography== Born in Klaksvik on 22 January 1937, J\u00f3nger\u00f0 Jensina Purkh\u00fas is the daughter of Jacob Pauli Purkh\u00fas (1908\u201390), a fisherman, and his wife Else Johanne Hansen (born 1912). Her family were not academically inclined but they were politically attached to the social and political ambitions of the Republic party which sought independence from Denmark. Klasvik was also the centre of strikes leading to clashes with the Danish authorities. This no doubt led to Purkh\u00fas' interest in nationalism and her decision to study political science. She completed her school education in 1953, without matriculating. After working for a few years in Klasvik, she moved to Copenhagen in 1960 where she worked at a grocer's during the day and attended the Akademisk Studenterkursus (Academic Student Course) in the evenings. She then succeeded in passing the matriculation examination which allowed her to start reading political science at the University of Copenhagen while working at the Social Research Institute and as a medical assistant for the elderly. In 1972, she became the first Faroese to graduate as a Cand.polit.. After working for an accounting firm, she returned to the Faroes in 1975 taking up a governmental post where she oversaw the transfer of the Danish postal service to a Faroese entity. Thereafter she worked in the postal service's administration managing accounting and transfer arrangements. From 1978, she returned to a government posting where she dealt with financial legislation. On the electoral front, she first stood as a candidate for Klaksvik in 1978. In the 1984 elections, she was one of three women who were elected to the L\u00f8gting, all of whom were elected as top candidates for their parties. For the Republic party, Purkh\u00fas received 620 votes and Karin Kj\u00f8lbro 504, while for the Social Democrats, Marita Petersen received 385. In 1985, in the coalition with the Social Democrats, the New Self-Government and the People's Party, Purkh\u00fas was appointed Minister of Finance and the Environment, becoming the first Faroese female minister. From 1988 to 1989, she was elected to the L\u00f8gting, representing the Republic party. In the new coalition in 1989 of the Republicans, the People's Party and the Union Party, she was Minister of the Economy, Social Affairs and the Judiciary until 1991. She remained in the L\u00f8gting for a number of years as a member of the Republic party before she withdrew from politics. Since 1976, Purkh\u00fas has lived in Velbasta\u00f0ur where her interests are livestock, folk dancing and patchwork. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Faroese politicians Category:Faroese women in politics Category:Government ministers of the Faroe Islands ",
