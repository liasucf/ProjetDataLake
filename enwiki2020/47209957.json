Sunil treats his profession as an earning job unlike his father, who landed up in debt because of treating the poor patients for free. Sunils' girlfriend Yashoda too, is a doctor working in a government hospital treating the profession as a service. A patient being treated by Dr Hira dies due to his negligence, but he saves his skin by firing the nurse. While operating on a minister's pregnant daughter- in-law, Manjula, Sunil is faced with a choice of saving either the mother or child. He opts for the former. The minister, Raosaheb, holds Sunil responsible for the child's death and lodges a complaint with the medical council. Dr Hira too sides with him against Sunil, getting him suspended. Sunil, in the meanwhile, comes to know about the truth of Hira's patient's death from the absconding nurse. Armed with the evidence, he files a case in the court and wins. Chastened Sunil decides to follow in his father's footsteps. ==Cast== * Om Puri as Dr. Sunil Gupta * Priya Tendulkar as Dr. Yashoda Gore * Sadashiv Amrapurkar as Raosaheb Mohite * Achyut Potdar as Dr. Hira * KK Raina as Kamlesh Pai * Arun Bakshi as Dr. Babubhai * Vijay Kashyap * Kamini Bhatia * Reema Lagoo as Manjula Mohite * Shivraj as Deshpande * Shashi Bala ==References== ==External links== * *Movies to See Before You Die Category:1985 films Category:1980s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films ",
