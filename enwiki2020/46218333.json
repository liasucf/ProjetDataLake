    "text": "Lowell Alvin Wakefield (August 17, 1909 \u2013 1977) is regarded as the founder of the Alaskan king crab industry, and Port Wakefield on the north-east coast of Raspberry Island, Alaska is named after him. Lowell Alvin Wakefield was born in Anacortes, Washington on August 17, 1909 to Emma Lanora (n\u00e9e Easter) and Lee Howard Wakefield. His father, a native of Texas, was well known in the salmon and herring industries throughout the Pacific Northwest. He established Port Wakefield shortly after World War II by Wakefield, having relocated his father's salmon cannery business, Apex Fish Company, from Anacortes, Washington, to Raspberry Island, Alaska, renaming it Wakefield Fisheries. Wakefield, who is regarded as the founder of the Alaskan king crab industry, introduced the canning of king crab, partly because of declining salmon stocks in surrounding waters. As well as the cannery, cedar log houses and a church were built for the workers. ==References== Category:1909 births Category:1977 deaths Category:American fishers Category:Businesspeople from Alaska Category:Commercial fishing in Alaska Category:People from Anacortes, Washington Category:People from Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska Category:20th- century American businesspeople ",
