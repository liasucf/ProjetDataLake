    "text": "Guidelines () is a 2014 Quebec feature-length documentary by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Caissy about adolescent students at the \u00c9cole Antoine Bernard high school in the rural community of Carleton-sur-Mer, in the Gasp\u00e9sie\u2013\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine region. The film uses a fly on the wall style of documentary storytelling as it chronicles such issues as drug use, bullying and disruptive behaviour, while contrasting school life with the freedom of the outdoors. In conversations between teachers or social workers and students, Caissy often makes use of a fixed camera, so that voices of adult authority are off-screen and unseen. Caissy has stated that Guidelines is part of a series of films he plans to make on five stages of human life: childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle age as well as old age, which was the subject of his 2010 feature documentary La belle visite. Caissy grew up in the Gasp\u00e9sie region, and was drawn to the Antoine Bernard school because it reminded him of his own experiences as a youth. The film is produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Its cinematographer is Nicolas Canniccioni. The editor is Mathieu Bouchard-Malo. ==Release== Guidelines had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. Its awards include the World Pulse Award for best documentary at , as well as Canadian Screen Award nominations for Best Feature Length Documentary, Best Editing in a Documentary and Best Cinematography in a Documentary at the 3rd Canadian Screen Awards. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2014 films Category:2014 documentary films Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries Category:Quebec films Category:Documentary films about adolescence Category:Documentary films about high school Category:Carleton-sur-Mer Category:Canadian films ",
