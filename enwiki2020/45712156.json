    "text": "Republika is a weekly newspaper from North Macedonia. Publishing began in 2012. In 2017 the print edition was shut down due to financial problems, but the publication has continued online. The magazine is reported to be supportive of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski of the VMRO-DPMNE party and to be owned by a company linked to Peter Schatz, a Hungarian media tycoon closely allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, similarily to TV station Alfa TV. It has been criticized by the civic fact-checking organization F2N2 for unverified sensationalist articles that promoted conspiracies involving Gruevski's rival, Zoran Zaev and George Soros. ==References== ==External links== * Official page Category:Newspapers published in North Macedonia Category:Macedonian-language newspapers Category:Magazines published in North Macedonia ",
