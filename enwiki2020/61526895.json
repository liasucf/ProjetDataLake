    "text": "Julie Law (born c. ) is an American molecular and cellular biologist. Law's pioneering work on DNA methylation patterns led to the discovery of the role of the CLASSY protein family in DNA methylation. Law is currently an associate professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. == Early life and education == Law began her scientific career at the Oregon State University where she completed a B.S. in biochemistry and biophysics. She completed her undergraduate research in the laboratory of Dr. Walt Ream. studying plant- microbe interactions She moved to the east coast to complete her doctoral work in biochemistry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Barbara Sollner-Webb Law's Ph.D. work uncovered the unique RNA editing mechanisms used by pathogenic eukaryotes called trypanosomes. Following her doctoral work, Law moved back to the west coast to pursue postdoctoral training at the University of California, Los Angeles in the lab of Dr. Steven Jacobsen, where she studied DNA methylation in Arabidopsis, a common model organism in biology allowing her to study epigenetic regulation. == Career and research == Law's postdoctoral work, studying DNA methylation at UC Los Angeles, was followed by her recruitment for a faculty position at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 2012. Currently, Law's lab at the Salk Institute studies epigenetic modifications in Arabidopsis thaliana to probe how epigenetic tags are recognized by proteins to regulate gene expression. Law is currently working with several other Salk scientists as a part of the Harnessing Plants Initiative to engineer plants to store more carbon dioxide as a means to harness more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to combat climate change. == Publications == Selected publications: * Wu, S., Turner, K.M., Nguyen, N., Raviram, R., Erb, M., Santini, J., Luebeck, J., Rajkumar, U., Diao, Y., Li, B., Zhang, W., Jameson, N., Corces, M.R., Granja, J.M., Chen, X., Coruh, C., Abnousi, A., Houston, J., Ye, Z., Hu, R., Yu, M., Kim, H., Law, J.A., Verhaak, R.G.W., Hu, M., Furnari, F.B., Chang, H.Y., Ren, B., Bafna, V., Mischel, P.S.
