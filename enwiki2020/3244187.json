More than 10,000 Scouts from all Mexico come to the main square of Mexico City and draw a gigantic fleur de lis, the emblem of the WOSM. It is drawn on a 10,000 m2 area, and filled up with aluminum cans. In 2007, the year of the World Scouting Centenary, a dove was incorporated into the original design as a symbol of Scouting as a universal movement of peace. In 2007 the Flor de Liz mas Grande del Mundo was one of Mexico's gifts of peace. https://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/biggest_Scout_emblem- world_record_set_by_Mexican_scouts_80342.htm ==Meztitla Scout Camp School== Owned by the ASMAC and located in Tepoztlan, Morelos, Meztitla is frequented by Scouts of Mexico and the world, but is also open camping enthusiasts. Meztitla was originally property of Dr. Paul E. Loewe, but in 1956 he donated the first lands for the campsite. The name Meztitla is a word derived from N\u00e1huatl, which literally means \"place near the moon\", due to ancient Aztec cave painting which depicts the moon, inside a cave on a hill in the surroundings. == See also == * Scouting in Mexico * WOSM-Interamerican Region ==Footnotes== ==External links== * ASMAC Homepage (Spanish) * Meztitla Homepage (Spanish) * Meztitla (ASMAC website) (Spanish) Category:World Organization of the Scout Movement member organizations Category:Scouting and Guiding in Mexico Category:Youth organizations established in 1920 Category:1920 establishments in Mexico ",
