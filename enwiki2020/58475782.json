    "text": "Australian Better Families is a registered political party in Australia since 31 August 2018. It is the political branch of an organisation named Australian Brotherhood of Fathers, who stated they created the party as they \"can no longer sit silently on the political sidelines to witness the betrayal of our children and families.\" The party's founder, Leith Erikson, is a men's rights activist. He started the #21fathers movement named for the unfounded claim that 21 men commit suicide each week because of family law issues such as child support and domestic violence orders. The party proposes to create a \"Minister for Men\" to complement the existing Minister for Women. == Candidates == The Australia Better Families Party nominated candidates for the 2019 Australian federal election in the following areas: * Senate candidates for New South Wales: Jewell Drury and Peter Moujalli * Senate candidates for Queensland: Darren Caulfield, Adam Finch and Rod Fox * Senate candidate for Tasmania: Greg Beck * Division of Greenway candidate: Graham McFarland ==References== ==External links== * Category:Political parties in Australia Category:Political parties established in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in Australia ",
