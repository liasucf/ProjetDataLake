    "text": "Ruth Helena Sinnott (n\u00e9e Kellogg; February 14, 1823 \u2013 May 29, 1897) was a Union nurse during the American Civil War. == Early life == Ruth Helena Kellogg was born February 14, 1823, in Manlius, New York, the daughter of Philo Kellogg and Nancy A. Riley Kellogg. She married Jonathan Patrick Sinnotte in 1848; they had two children together, Millard and Nancy, both born in Ohio. Ruth Sinnotte became a young widow with two small children when Jonathan Sinnotte died in 1852. She moved with her son and daughter to Peoria, Illinois. == Civil War Service == Sinnotte was commissioned in St. Louis, Missouri to serve on the steamer Imperial, traveling between Pittsburgh Landing and St. Louis. When this ship was out of service, Sinnotte then went to the steamer Ella until this steamer too was out of service. She then was transferred to Monterey, Tennessee, to service in the hospital at Corith. Her service here, however, was cut short by illness, causing her to return home to Illinois. Soon, she was traveling again, this time with the 113th Illinois Infantry, to Memphis where she served on the Vicksburg fleet, once again on the Imperial. == Later years == Ruth Sinnotte died in Lexington, Kansas on May 29, 1897, aged 74 years. ==References == == External links == * Category:Women in the American Civil War Category:1823 births Category:1897 deaths Category:People from Manlius, New York Category:American Civil War nurses ",
