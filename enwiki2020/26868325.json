    "text": "Thomas Perry ( 1738 \u2013 November 1818) was an Irish luthier who introduced a type of bowed psaltery known as the cither viol or sultana. He is regarded as one of Ireland's greatest ever violin makers and is often referred to as \u201cThe Irish Stradivari\u201d. Perry's output was quite prolific and his shop has been credited with making over 4,000 instruments. His violins are usually numbered on the button and inscribed at the back below the button 'Perry Dublin'. ==Biography== Perry was probably born in County Laois, Ireland Molony, Orla: \"Perry, Thomas\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p.829\u201330). to John Perry who an established violin maker (died 1771) and worked in the Temple Bar of Dublin. ==Career== Perry followed in the footsteps of his father, and began working as a luthier in his shop in Dublin. His earliest documented violin is dated 1764. Perry and took over his fathers shop around 1766 and by 1770, Perry had established his business in nearby Anglesea Street. He worked independently until around 1781, when he went into partnership with William Wilkinson, forming the firm of Perry and Wilkinson. He numbered all his violins and is known to have made more than 4,000.Molony (2013); as above. As well as making first-class violins, Perry also made violas, cellos and at least one double- bass, some of which are in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland. He invented the cither-viol or sultana in the 1760s and was renowned for the quality and beauty of his instruments.Irish Times, William Galland Stuart, 21 September 1973 Tradition has it that Perry was able to copy an Amati lent to him by the Duke of Leinster, but his other models are of a more Tyrolean type or reminiscent of the work of Richard Duke in London.Brian W. Harvey: The Violin Family and its Makers in the British Isles, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995. pp 183-185 The violin maker Richard Tobin, who later set up business in London, was one of his apprentices, and Vincenzo Panormo worked with Perry prior to moving to London. His pupils included violin makers John Delaney, John Mackintosh, William Ringwood, and William Wilkinson (1771-1838), who married Perry's eldest daughter and carried on the business after Perry's death until 1839. ==Bibliography== * A.
