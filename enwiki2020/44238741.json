    "text": "Andreas B\u00f8dtker Christensen (; born 10 April 1996) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a centre back for English club Chelsea and the Denmark national team. Christensen began his career at Br\u00f8ndby and joined Chelsea at the age of 15 in February 2012, making his professional debut in October 2014. From 2015 to 2017 he was loaned to Bundesliga club Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, where he made 82 appearances and scored 7 goals. Christensen made his full international debut for Denmark in June 2015, and represented the nation at the 2018 World Cup. ==Club career== ===Chelsea=== ====Early career==== Christensen playing for Chelsea in 2013 Christensen was born in Liller\u00f8d, Aller\u00f8d Municipality. The son of former Br\u00f8ndby IF goalkeeper Sten Christensen, he began his career with Br\u00f8ndby IF. He spent eight years there, attracting the interest of Europe's elite clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich. On 7 February 2012, Christensen signed for Chelsea on a free transfer, near the end of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas' tenure as the club's manager. Upon joining the London side, Christensen said: \"I have chosen Chelsea because they play the kind of football I like.\u201d Christensen was first included in a Chelsea senior squad for their last game of the 2012\u201313 season on 19 May 2013, but did not feature in the match, which ended a 2\u20131 home win over Everton in Rafael Ben\u00edtez's last match as manager. In the pre-season tour of the United States before the 2013\u201314 season, he was part of the senior team squad and signed a professional contract thereafter. ====2014\u201315 season==== He made his professional debut on 28 October 2014, playing the full 90 minutes at right back as Chelsea won 2\u20131 away to Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup. Christensen did not play again until 24 January 2015, when he was utilized in the same position for Chelsea's 2\u20134 home defeat to League One team Bradford City in the FA Cup fourth round. Although Christensen played no further part in the campaign, Chelsea won the League Cup with a 2\u20130 victory over rival club Tottenham Hotspur in the final. When asked who was man of the match for the final, manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said \"Man of the match was Andreas Christensen who played well against Shrewsbury. There are more than John Terry (the official Man of the match for the final) because we are a team. I am proud of the guys.\" On 13 April 2015, Christensen played for Chelsea U19 in the final of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Youth League against Shakhtar Donetsk in Switzerland and although he scored an own goal to cancel out Izzy Brown's opener in the first-half, Chelsea still ended with a 3\u20132 victory.http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000561/match=2016409/postmatch/report/index.html#brown+inspires+chelsea+youth+league+glory He made his Premier League debut against Sunderland on 24 May, replacing John Obi Mikel with 12 minutes remaining in a 3\u20131 home victory. Although Christensen only made one league appearances out of the whole season, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica medal from his club for his contributions this season. ====Loan to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach==== On 10 July 2015, Christensen joined Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea. He made his debut on 10 August against FC St. Pauli in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, winning 4\u20131. Five days later, Christensen made his Bundesliga debut in a 4\u20130 loss at Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first professional goals on 5 February 2016, a brace in a 5\u20131 win over Werder Bremen at Borussia-Park. After an impressive debut season, Christensen was voted the team's Player of the Season, ahead of Granit Xhaka, the team captain. After the success of his first season, M\u00f6nchegladbach made multiple attempts to move his loan move into a permanent during the 2016 summer, although it was reported Chelsea rejected the \u00a314.25 million bid from the German side. In the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League, Christensen scored the final goal of a 4\u20132 win away to Fiorentina in the second leg of the last 32 to assure a 4\u20133 aggregate win. He was on target again in the next round against neighbours Schalke, who won on away goals after a 3\u20133 aggregate draw. ====Return to Chelsea==== Christensen playing for Chelsea in 2017 On 12 August 2017, Christensen made his first appearance for Chelsea following his two-year loan spell in Germany, coming off the bench following captain Gary Cahill being sent off, in Chelsea's 3\u20132 opening day home defeat against Burnley. Eight days later, he made his first Premier League start in a 2\u20131 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium. On 9 January 2018, Christensen signed a new four-and-half- year deal with Chelsea running until 2022, after establishing himself in the first team. Christensen made 40 appearances for the Blues in 2017\u201318, including three in the victorious FA Cup campaign. However, a back injury meant he was not involved in the final. Prior to the season's finish, he was awarded the club's Young Player of the Year award. New manager Maurizio Sarri preferred to pair David Luiz and Antonio R\u00fcdiger in central defence, and by February 2019 Christensen had made 15 appearances, only two of which in the league. However, he ruled out wanting to leave the club. ==International career== On 8 June 2015, Christensen made his senior international debut for Denmark in a 2\u20131 home friendly win against Montenegro at the Viborg Stadium, as a 69th-minute substitute for Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg. On 24 March 2016, Christensen made his first Denmark start in a 2\u20131 victory over Iceland, playing the full 90 minutes of the friendly at the MCH Arena. Christensen played six matches in Denmark's successful 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. On 14 November 2017 he scored his first international goal to equalise in a 5\u20131 win over the Republic of Ireland in the second leg of the play-off. Manager Age Hareide called him up for the final tournament in Russia. He partnered Simon Kj\u00e6r in central defence, having been able to play in that position due to Andreas Bjelland's absence through injury, but played in defensive midfield in the final group game against France. In the last 16 against Croatia, he remained in midfield to combat the opponents' strength in that sector, but made an error that allowed Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 to equalise as the Croats went on to win on penalties. ==Style of play== Christensen is a centre back. In 2018, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said the Dane had displayed \"great maturity\" adding that he has \"a lot of trust in Christensen. This player is a player for the present for Chelsea, and for Chelsea's future for 10 or 12 years. He can also become the captain of this team in the future\". ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Chelsea |2014\u201315 |Premier League |1||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Premier League |27||0||3||0||4||0||6Appearances in UEFA Champions League||0||0||0||40||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Premier League |8||0||2||0||4||0||15Appearances in UEFA Europa League||0||0||0||29||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Premier League |21||0||2||0||0||0||4||0||1Appearance in UEFA Super Cup||0||28||0 |- |2020\u201321 |Premier League |4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !61!!0!!8!!0!!9!!0!!25!!0!!1!!0!!104!!0 |- |rowspan=3|Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach (loan) |2015\u201316 |Bundesliga |31||3||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||3 |- |2016\u201317 |Bundesliga |31||2||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||9Six appearances in UEFA Champions League, three appearances and two goals in UEFA Europa League||2||colspan=2|\u2014||43||4 |- !colspan=2|Total !62!!5!!6!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!14!!2!!colspan=2|\u2014!!82!!7 |- !colspan=3|Career total !123!!5!!14!!0!!9!!0!!39!!2!!1!!0!!186!!7 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Denmark |2015||2||0 |- |2016||4||0 |- |2017||8||1 |- |2018||9||0 |- |2019||8||0 |- |2020||5||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||36||1 |} ===International goals=== :As of match played 14 November 2017.
