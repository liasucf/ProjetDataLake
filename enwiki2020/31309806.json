The Gators competed in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by head coach Billy Donovan, and played their home games in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus. The Gators were the SEC regular season champions, winning a share of the title with a 12\u20134 conference record. Despite having four players undergo surgery during the year, and starting off 1-3 in conference play, they rebounded to capture the school's first ever back-to-back SEC championships. They earned a three seed in the 2001 NCAA Tournament and advanced to the Second Round before losing to Temple. The Gators won an opening round game in the NCAA Tournament for a school record third consecutive year. ==Roster== {| class=\"sortable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- !Name !Number !Position !Height !Weight !Class !Hometown |- | Matt Bonner | 15 | F | 6-10 | 237 | Sophomore | Concord, NH |- | Bonell Colas | 42 | F | 6-9 | 225 | Freshman | Miami, Florida |- | Adriel Davis | 33 | F | 6-5 | 221 | Sophomore | Tallahassee, Florida |- | Teddy Dupay | 5 | G | 5-11 | 178 | Junior | Fort Myers, Florida |- | Orien Greene | 1 | G | 6-4 | 208 | Freshman | Gainesville, Florida |- | LaDarius Halton | 23 | F | 6-4 | 200 | Sophomore | New Smyrna Beach, Florida |- | Justin Hamilton | 12 | G | 6-3 | 207 | Sophomore | Sarasota, Florida |- | Udonis Haslem | 50 | C | 6-9 | 246 | Junior | Miami, Florida |- | David Kliewer | 20 | G | 6-2 | 175 | Sophomore | Tarpon Springs, Florida |- | Brett Nelson | 10 | G | 6-4 | 182 | Sophomore | St. Albans, West Virginia |- | Major Parker | 25 | F | 6-4 | 218 | Senior | Fort Lauderdale, Florida |- | Brent Wright | 0 | F | 6-9 | 235 | Senior | Miami, Florida |- |} ===Coaches=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- |Name |Position |College |Graduating year |- | Billy Donovan | Head Coach | Providence College | 1987 |- | John Pelphrey | Assistant Coach | University of Kentucky | 1992 |- | Anthony Grant | Assistant Coach | Dayton | 1987 |- | Donnie Jones | Assistant Coach | Pikeville | 1988 |} == References == Category:Florida Gators men's basketball seasons Florida Florida Florida Gators men's basketball team Florida Gators men's basketball team ",
