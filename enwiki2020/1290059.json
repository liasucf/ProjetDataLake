    "text": "The Romanian Democratic Convention (; abbreviated CDR) was an electoral alliance of several centre-right political parties in Romania, active from 1991 until 2000. The most prominent leaders of the CDR throughout the 1990s were by far Corneliu Coposu, Ion Ra\u021biu, and Ion Diaconescu, all three members of the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PN\u021a-CD - successor and political heir to the National Peasants' Party, active in the Kingdom of Romania between 1926\u20131948). == History == ===1991\u20131992: Foundation=== CDR was founded in 1991, one year before the 1992 elections, mainly by the PN\u0162-CD and the National Liberal Party (PNL). In addition, aside from the aforementioned political forces, several other noteworthy civic and cultural organizations, foundations, and other minor political parties were involved in the foundational process. Initially, the planned name of the CDR was \"The National Convention for Democracy Implementation\" (). Subsequently, the main purpose of the CDR was to amount an effective opposition against the then all-dominating National Salvation Front, a huge parliamentary bloc made up mostly of former second and third rank members of the Romanian Communist Party, which assumed leadership of the country shortly after the 1989 Revolution. Below is a table representation of CDR's parliamentary presence between 1990 and 1992, in the wake of the results of the 1990 Romanian general election: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2|Party ! colspan=\"2\"|Parliament Seats |- !

Although the convention won the capital city of Bucharest and much of the larger urban centres at the 1992 local elections, FSN swept over almost all rural areas and small towns. In the 1992 general elections, individual parties were awarded seats as follows: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2|Party ! colspan=\"2\"|Parliament Seats |- ! Chamber ! Senate |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PN\u021a-CD | 41 | 21 |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PAC | 13 | 7 |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PNL-AT | 11 | 1 |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PSDR | 10 | 1 |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PNL-CD | 3 | 4 |- |style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align: left;\"|PER | 4 | |- ! colspan=2 | Total | 82 | 34 |- |} The alliance also included the UDMR/RMDSZ, which ran on a separate list, and a number of minor parties and civic organisations that failed to gain parliamentary representation: the Democratic Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Ecologist Federation of Romania (FER), the Civic Alliance and others. At the 1992 general elections, Emil Constantinescu was the presidential candidate of the convention. He managed to qualify in the second round where he finished second with an electoral score of 38.57% (or 4,641,207 votes). ===1996\u20132000: Government=== Subsequently, CDR managed to win the 1996 Romanian elections, and the alliance's presidential candidate, once again Emil Constantinescu, became president with 54.41% (or 7,057,906 votes). Below is the distribution of seats in the Chamber of Deputies between the components of the alliance after the 1996 elections, the first in post-1989 Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2|Party ! colspan=\"2\"|Parliament Seats |- !

At governing level, this grand coalition resulted in the Ciorbea Cabinet (1996\u20131998), Vasile Cabinet (1998\u20131999), and Is\u0103rescu Cabinet (1999\u20132000). ===CDR 2000=== Due to internal frictions within the alliance (as well as given the somewhat inconsistent and turbulent governing from 1996 to 2000), the PNL decided to withdraw from the CDR prior to the 2000 general elections. Nonetheless, PN\u021aCD and other parties ran on the CDR 2000 common list for these elections. The alliance did not manage to score the same positive results as during the 1990s and, consequently, shortly disbanded since it did not pass the electoral threshold. ==Electoral history== ===Legislative elections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election ! colspan=\"3\" |Chamber ! colspan=\"3\" |Senate ! rowspan=\"2\" |Position ! rowspan=\"2\" |Aftermath |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- !1992 |2,117,144 |19.46 | |2,210,722 |20.16 | |style=\"text-align: center;\"|1 | |- !1996 |3,692,321 |30.17 | |3,772,084 |30.70 | |style=\"text- align: center;\"|2 | |- !2000 |546,135 |5.04 | |575,706 |5.29 | |style=\"text- align: center;\"| (as CDR 2000)3 | |} Notes: 1 CDR members in 1992: PN\u021aCD (21 senators and 41 deputies), PAC (7 senators and 13 deputies), PNL-AT (1 senator and 11 deputies), PSDR (1 senator and 10 deputies), PNL-CD (4 senators and 3 deputies) and PER (no senators and 4 deputies). 2 CDR members in 1996: PN\u021aCD (25 senators and 81 deputies), PNL (22 senators and 28 deputies), PNL-CD (1 senator and 4 deputies), PAR (3 senators and 3 deputies), PER (1 senator and 5 deputies) and Ecologist Federation of Romania (FER - 1 senator and 1 deputy). 3 CDR 2000 members: PN\u021aCD, UFD, Ecologist Federation of Romania (FER), National Christian Democratic Alliance (ANCD) and The Moldavians Party (PM). === Presidential elections === {| class=wikitable width=100% ! rowspan=2|Election ! rowspan=2|Candidate ! colspan=3|First round ! colspan=3|Second round |- !Votes !Percentage !Position !Votes !Percentage !Position |-align=center ! 1992 | 1 || 3,717,006 || || || 4,641,207 || || |-align=center ! 1996 | 1 || 3,569,941 || || || 7,057,906 || || |-align=center !2000 | 2 || 1,069,463 || || || bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=3| |} Notes: 1 Emil Constantinescu was the common centre-right candidate that was endorsed by the PN\u021aCD in both 1992 and 1996 as part of the CDR. 2 Mugur Is\u0103rescu was endorsed by the PN\u021aCD at the 2000 elections as part of the CDR 2000 alliance. == See also == * Politics of Romania * List of political parties in Romania == References == == Bibliography == * Dan Pavel, Iulia Huia, <> O istorie analitic\u0103 a Conven\u0163iei Democratice, 1989-2000, Editura Polirom, Ia\u015fi, 2003 * Roper, Steven D., <>, East European Quarterly, 1997.
