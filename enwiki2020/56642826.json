Various news and lifestyle sites published columns lamenting the cancellation, while continuing to praise the show for its female representation, diverse cast, and handling of complex issues. The cancellation was deemed to be \"disappointing\" and a \"loss for television\". The cancellation also led to criticism of Netflix's algorithm, highlighted by its failure to recommend the show to creator Hanawalt, and at Netflix itself for prematurely canceling the series less than three months after its premiere, disallowing the show a chance to grow its audience. ===Adult Swim revival=== On May 22, 2020, it was announced that the series would be revived on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2021, making it the second Netflix original series to be revived coming off the cancellation of One Day at a Time in 2019. ==Episodes== ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 98% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Tuca & Bertie skips right past BoJack Horsemans shadow with its chipper sensibility and madcap sight gags, bringing plenty of laughs as it addresses adulting anxiety and exalts the joys of friendship.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In a positive review, Kate Abbott of The Guardian wrote that the show was \"a chirpily realised world that stays true to its experimentalism - and its pleasures are consistent, if deliciously twisted, and very surreal indeed.\" James Poniewozik of The New York Times, praised \"Hanawalt's surreal vision, the anarchic fluidity of the landscape, the series's whimsically bending laws of both nature and physics.\" Critics praised the show's female-focused portrayal of trauma, desire, and friendship. In a negative review, Brian Lowry of CNN wrote that the show did not stand out beyond similar adult animations on Adult Swim, declaring that the show was \"strictly for the birds\". The show drew both praise and criticism for perceived similarities to Comedy Central's Broad City, due to both shows focusing on female friendship. === Awards and accolades === Upon release, The A.V.
