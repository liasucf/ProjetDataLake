As a child he felt a strong calling to serve God and so once wrote in his journal: \"Earthly ideals are fading away. I see the ideal of life in sacrifice, and the ideal of sacrifice in priesthood\". Pelczar studied in Rzeszow and then commenced his studies for the priesthood in Przemy\u015bl in 1860. At the age of 16 he became a member of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society and of the organization known as Popular Education. After the completion of his studies, he was ordained as a priest on 17 July 1864. He was assigned to be a parish priest at Sambor. He was later transferred to Rome in 1866 for further studies and he studied at the Institute of Saint Apollinaris and at the Collegium Romanum. He gained a doctorate in both theological studies and in canon law. He also served as a professor from 1869 to 1877 and served in that role in both Przemy\u015bl and Krakow from 1882 to 1883. Pelczar established several libraries and he delivered free lectures and published countless books. He would write on historical topics as well as on canon law. He started a school for those who were servants. He founded the Fraternity of Our Lady, Queen of the Polish Crown in 1891 with the objective of caring for the poor and for orphans as well as for the sick and those who had no job.

Pope Leo XIII appointed Pelczar as the Bishop of Przemy\u015bl on 17 December 1900 and he was installed in 1901. He made frequent visits to all parishes within the diocese and supported all religious orders. He also conducted three episcopal meetings to discuss diocesan issues and worked to reform seminaries to promote better education and greater access to resources for them. In addition to this, he also built and restored churches, established nurseries, kitchens, homeless shelters and schools. He ensured that the implementation of the social doctrine described in the writings of Leo XIII \u2014 such as the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum - was a top priority. Pelczar also served as one of the co-consecrators at the consecration of Achille Ratti \u2014 the future Pope Pius XI on 28 October 1919.
