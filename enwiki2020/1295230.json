    "text": "Coca-Cola HBC A.G. also known as Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company or just Coca-Cola Hellenic is the world's third-largest Coca-Cola anchor bottler in terms of volume with sales of more than 2 billion unit cases. Coca-Cola HBC's shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing on the Athens Stock Exchange. The company is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Coca-Cola HBC has been named the industry leader among beverage companies in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and is also included in the FTSE4Good Index. ==History== Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. was incorporated under the laws of Greece in 1969, with headquarters in Athens. The Coca-Cola Company granted to the company its bottling rights in the country in 1969. In August 2000 Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. acquired Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd, the former European operations of Coca-Cola Amatil, and formed Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. In October 2012, the company announced that it was moving its operational headquarters to Switzerland and would switch its main market listing to London. This was a major blow to the Athens stock market, as Coca-Cola Hellenic was its largest listed company by value. Reasons for the move included better access to financing and a move away from crisis ridden Greece, which had prompted ratings agencies to downgrade its credit over the summer to three notches above \"junk\" level. On 29 April 2013 Coca- Cola HBC AG (\u201cCCHBC AG\u201d), the new Swiss holding company, was admitted to the London Stock Exchange\u2019s main market. On 11 September 2013 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its inclusion into the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices. Coca- Cola HBC was named the industry leader among beverage companies in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. On 24 July 2014 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its delisting of its American depositary receipts (ADRs) from the New York Stock Exchange, the termination of its ADR programme, and the deregistration and termination of its reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In October 2017 the company's CEO, Dimitris Lois, died after a period of illness. On 7 December 2017, Zoran Bogdanovi\u0107 was appointed as new CEO by the Board of Directors. On 18 February 2019, the company announced a deal valued at \u20ac260 million to acquire Serbian food company Bambi from Mid Europa Partners. ==Operations== Coca-Cola HBC operates in 28 countries in 3 continents; its well established markets include Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, its developing markets include Poland, the Baltic States, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Croatia. Its emerging markets include Russia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, Montenegro, Armenia, Moldova, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Nigeria. The company's stock is 23.3% owned by the Kar-Tess Holding (a Luxembourg company) and 23.2% by the Coca-Cola Company. The remaining 53.5% are in free float of which about two-thirds are held by UK and US institutional investors. == References == == External links == * Category:Coca-Cola bottlers Category:Drink companies of Greece Category:Food and drink companies established in 1969 Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Athens Exchange Category:Greek subsidiaries of foreign companies Category:Drink companies of Switzerland Category:Greek companies established in 1969 ",
