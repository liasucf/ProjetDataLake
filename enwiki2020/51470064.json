Winonah Beamer was among 436 black and white activists who eventually and successfully broke the system. She said, \"Our feeling at the time was, 'We're going to keep coming and we're going to flood your jails, cram your dockets and break you financially,' \" David Myers and Winonah Beamer married in 1962. She spent most of her life working with people with intellectual disabilities at a number of places in Ohio, including 22 years with the Montgomery County Board of Mental Retardation.
