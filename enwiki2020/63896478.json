    "text": "Glycopyrronium bromide/formoterol, sold under the brand name Bevespi Aerosphere, is a combination medication for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a combination of glycopyrronium bromide and formoterol. It is inhaled. The most common side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick), muscle spasms and dizziness. Glycopyrronium bromide is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. This means that it blocks muscarinic receptors (targets) in muscle cells in the lungs. Because these receptors help control the contraction of muscles, when glycopyrronium is inhaled, it causes the muscles of the airways to relax, helping to keep the airways open. Formoterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist. It works by attaching to receptors known as beta-2 receptors found in the muscles of the airways. When it attaches to these receptors, it causes the muscles to relax, which keeps the airways open. On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Trixeo Aerosphere (formoterol fumarate dihydrate/glycopyrronium bromide/budesonide), intended for maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults whose disease is not adequately controlled.
