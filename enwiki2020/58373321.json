The princesses was warped on Earth separately, and lives regular lives there. But an evil spreads on the knight's land, and his rival (Dingdong Dantes) was on their throats. The mission's cover was to revive the carnival/fair to lure the princesses. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== ===Supporting cast=== ===Extended cast=== ===Special participation=== ==Reception== ===Critical response=== While praise was directed at the film's use of special effects and its carnival setting, Vice Ganda's performance in Fantastica received mixed reviews from critics who viewed his continued reliance on insult comedy and innuendos as stale and repetitive. Fantastica was released to mixed reviews from critics. Zsarlene B. Chua of BusinessWorld praised the opening sequence by El Gamma Penumbra, fourth wall-breaking jokes and the film's parodies of various drama films, but viewed Vice's continued reliance on insult comedy and innuendos as stale and repetitive, saying \"The movie's premise and sheer starpower guarantee the film will be a blockbuster, but if you're expecting something new from Mr. Viceral's yearly MMFF entry, you're bound to be disappointed as it is more of the same: innuendos (which makes one question why it's rated Parental Guidance) and his usual insult comedy.\" She did however conclude that \"it's a feel-good if mind-numbing film for people who want to shut down and get a few laughs here and there.\" John Magbanua of Bandera also gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's special effects and romantic pairings but was critical of the formulaic production and what he noted as censorship done presumably to make the film more family-friendly. Magbanua also noted that Fantastica could have incorporated more carnival elements to add more to the film's narrative. ===Box office gross=== It was announced by Star Cinema in a thanksgiving dinner organized for Fantastica, that the film became the highest grossing MMFF film which starred Vice Ganda. Fantastica earned with the figure including earnings from both domestic and international release of the film. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:Circus films Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine fantasy-comedy films Category:Philippine urban fantasy films Category:2010s fantasy-comedy films Category:Star Cinema comedy films Category:Viva Films films Category:Films set in amusement parks ",
