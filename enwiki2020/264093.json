In 2018, the airport handled 514,685 passengers, and, in 2011, was the 20th busiest in Canada in terms of aircraft movements, with 94,747. Air Canada Express, Swoop, WestJet and WestJet Encore serve London International Airport. It also provides services for cargo airlines. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

A group of local businessmen acquired the site in 1928 and by 3 May 1929 an airport license was issued to London Airport Ltd. The London Flying Club was formed in 1928 and became a tenant of the new airport.In 1927 the Government of Canada started a program to stimulate the growth of civil aviation through the creation of flying clubs. Groups that could provide a suitable airfield with facilities and at least 30 members were supplied with two aircraft and awarded $100 for each member who qualified as a pilot. The London Flying Club was established under this program. The airfield was used for flying instruction, private aviation, and for air mail. By 1933 it had become too small for some commercial aircraft. The London Flying Club continued to use the Lambeth airfield until 7 August 1942. ===London City Airport, 1940-1945=== In 1935 the city decided to replace the original London Airport. Site surveys and consultations took place and on 9 September 1939, at the start of World War II, work began on a new airport located near Crumlin. The city leased the new airport to the Government of Canada, Department of Transport on 24 January 1940 for the duration of the war. Runways 14-32 and 05-23 were paved and ready for use by July 1940 and the Royal Canadian Air Force established RCAF Station Crumlin on part of the airport.Hatch, F. J.

Military Bruce Historical Writings by Bruce Forsyth This air station was host to No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School(EFTS) and No. 4 Air Observer School(AOS), both part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The airport remained under civilian management and was used for civil and military aviation during the war years. The licence for London City Airport was issued on 6 May 1941. Improvements made during this time include: * main terminal building (civilian) opened in July 1942 * Trans-Canada Airlines began serve to the airport in July 1942. * runway 08-26 added in 1943. British Commonwealth Air Training Plan operations ended on 31 December 1944 with the closure of No. 4 Air Observer School. The Royal Air Force Transport Command, No. 45 Group established the Mosquito Preparation and Despatching Unit at London on 10 January 1945. This detachment had twenty three members and test flew De Havilland Mosquitos built in Toronto before they were flown overseas. After the war the airport remained under the control of the Department of Transport.Many municipalities in Canada declined to accept responsibility for their airports after the war and so the Government of Canada, Department of Transport became the operator of most of the larger airports in the country. ====Aerodrome Information==== In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed at with a Var. 5 degrees W and elevation of .

Initially equipped with Harvard aircraft, the squadron upgraded to Mustangs in 1952 and Canadair CT-133 jets in 1954. The squadron disbanded in 1957. Air Defence Command reformed 2420 Aircraft Control and Warning (Auxiliary) Squadron at London on 1 July 1956. 2420 trained Fighter Control operators and disbanded on 31 May 1961.
