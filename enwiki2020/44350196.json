He has worked on the classification of the Cariban language family, and has collected primary linguistic data from speakers of 14 Cariban languages and 5 non- Cariban languages. ==Education and personal life== Meira holds a BA and a PhD in Linguistics Theory and Analysis from Rice University. His doctoral research was in collaboration with his supervisor Spike Gildea. S\u00e9rgio Meira is a member of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and of the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA). In addition to his native Portuguese, S\u00e9rgio Meira is proficient in English, French, and Spanish, is moderately fluent in Esperanto, Italian, German, Dutch, Volap\u00fck, Romanian, and has a good command of Catalan, Russian, Latin, and other languages. ==Career== He is currently a researcher at the Radboud University Nijmegen. His research focuses on historical linguistics, fieldwork and description of the Cariban and Tupian language families, as well as language and cognition. His work helped in the development of the South American Phonological Inventory Database (SAPhon), the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), and Glottolog. ==Volap\u00fck== S\u00e9rgio Meira is one of eight academicians at the International Volap\u00fck Academy. He was appointed in 2007 by Brian Reynold Bishop, the seventh cifal and the academy's president at that time. He is also an active member of the Volap\u00fck discussion group, which unites most living volap\u00fckologists. Meira translated articles, including Rasmus Malling-Hansen's obituary, from Volap\u00fck into English for the International Rasmus Malling-Hansen Society. He also did translation work on the Volap\u00fck Wikisource, but later suggested that his work be deleted because it would be considered copyright infringement. S\u00e9rgio Meira is one of Andrew Drummond's correspondents who contributed to his knowledge of Volap\u00fck material prior to the writing of A Hand-Book of Volap\u00fck. In late October 2006, S\u00e9rgio Meira started contributing to the Volap\u00fck Wikipedia.
