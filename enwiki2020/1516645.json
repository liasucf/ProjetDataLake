    "text": "Robert Thomas Bigelow (born May 12, 1945) is an American businessman. He owns the hotel chain Budget Suites of America and is the founder of Bigelow Aerospace. ==Early life and education== Bigelow grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, attended Highland Elementary School, and was first exposed to science through witnessing\u2014from a distance\u2014a number of the nuclear weapons tests conducted about 70 miles northwest of the city. At age 12, Bigelow decided that his future lay in space travel, despite his limitations in mathematics, and he resolved to choose a career that would make him rich enough that, one day, he could hire the scientific expertise required to launch his own space program. Until then, he would tell no one\u2014not even his wife\u2014about his ultimate goal. He entered the University of Nevada, Reno, in 1962 to study banking and real estate, and he graduated from Arizona State University in 1967. ==Career== After many years from the late 1960s through the 1990s developing commercial real estate hotels, motels and apartments, Bigelow founded Bigelow Aerospace in 1999. In 1995, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science to research and advance study of various fringe sciences and paranormal topics, most notably ufology. The organization researched cattle mutilation and black triangle reports, ultimately attributing the latter to the military. The institute was disbanded in 2004. In 1996, Bigelow bought in Utah the Skinwalker Ranch, a 480-acre cattle ranch \"that some believe is the site of an interdimensional doorway used by alien shape-shifters and stationed watchers there.\" Bigelow has indicated that he plans to spend up to to develop the first commercial space station, 33% of the $1.5 billion that NASA expended on a single space shuttle mission. Bigelow Aerospace has launched two experimental space modules, Genesis I and Genesis II, and has plans for full- scale manned space habitats to be used as orbital hotels, research labs and factories. In his real estate career, Bigelow built approximately 15,000 units, and purchased another 8,000. For most of his career, \"he held on to almost everything he bought, but ... eventually unload much of his housing stock in the boom years immediately before the 2008 crash\". In 2013, Bigelow reflected on this: \"People just really wanted to throw money away, ... So that was lucky.\" In 2013, Bigelow indicated that the reason he went into the commercial real estate business was to obtain the requisite resources to be able to fund a team developing space destinations. Bigelow's BEAM module was launched to the International Space Station on April 8, 2016, on the eighth SpaceX cargo resupply mission. Bigelow was interviewed on Coast to Coast AM in March 2013. In May 2017, Bigelow appeared on CBS' 60 Minutes and said he was \"absolutely convinced\" there have been extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. In October 2017, Bigelow announced that he planned to put an inflatable \"space hotel\" into orbit by 2022. The plan is part of partnership with United Launch Alliance, and the project is estimated to cost $2.3 billion in total. Bigelow was reported by the New York Times in December, 2017 to have urged Senator Harry Reid to initiate what became the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, a government study which operated from 2007 to 2012 tasked with the study of UFOs. According to the New York Times, Bigelow said he was \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d that aliens exist and have visited Earth. In March 2020, Bigelow Aerospace let go of all 68 members of staff and halted operations after over 20 years of business, in a move that was partly caused by the coronavirus pandemic. ==See also== *Skinwalker Ranch ==References== Ghost adventures Pinoche Hotel ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Bigelow Aerospace website Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:1945 births Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:American aerospace businesspeople Category:American chief executives of travel and tourism industry companies Category:American company founders Category:American hoteliers Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Arizona State University alumni Category:Bigelow Aerospace Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Las Vegas Category:University of Nevada, Reno alumni ",
