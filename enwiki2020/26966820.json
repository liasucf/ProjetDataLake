    "text": "Kaechon Internment Camp (Hangeul: , also spelled Kae'ch\u014fn or Gaecheon) is a labor camp in North Korea for political prisoners and descendants of alleged criminals. The official name for the camp is Kwan-li-so (Penal-labor colony) No. 14. The camp is commonly known as Camp 14. It is not to be confused with the Kaechon concentration camp (Kyo-hwa-so No. 1), which is located to the northwest. ==Description== The camp was established around 1959 in central North Korea near Kae'ch\u014fn county, South Pyongan Province. It is situated along the middle reaches of the Taedong river, which forms the southern boundary of the camp, and includes the mountains north of the river, including Purok-san. Bukchang, a concentration camp (Kwan-li-so No.18) adjoins the southern banks of the Taedong River. The camp is about in area, with farms, mines and factories threaded through the steep mountain valleys.North Korean Human Rights: Prison Camps in 2012..., ned.org; accessed October 30, 2014. The camp includes overcrowded barracks that house males, females, and older children separately, a headquarters with administrative buildings and guard housing. Altogether around 15,000 are imprisoned in Kaechon internment camp. ==Purpose== The main purpose of the Kaechon internment camp is to keep politically unreliable persons classed \"unredeemable\" isolated from society and to exploit their labour. Those sent to the camp include officials perceived to have performed poorly in their job, people who criticize the regime, their children, anyone who was born in the camp, and anyone suspected of engaging in \"anti-government\" activities. Prisoners have to work in one of the coal mines, in agriculture, or in one of the factories that produce textiles, paper, food, rubber, shoes, ceramics, and cement. Livestock raising is considered the occupation of choice for the prisoners as it gives them the chance to steal animal food and pick through animal droppings for undigested grains. ==Human rights situation== Witnesses have reported that prisoners interred in the camp are required to work for long periods, often from 5:30 to midnight. Even 11-year-old children have to work after school and thus rarely see their parents. Other reports describe prisoners being beaten and severely punished for minor infractions. Food rations are scant, consisting of salted cabbage and corn. The prisoners are emaciated; they lose their teeth, and their gums blacken. Many die of malnourishment, illness, work accidents, and the after-effects of torture. Many prisoners resort to eating frogs, insects, rats, snakes, and even cannibalism in order to try to survive. Eating rat flesh helps prevent pellagra, a common disease in the camp resulting from the absence of protein and niacin in the diet. In order to eat anything outside of the prison-sanctioned meal, including these animals, prisoners must first get permission from the guards. ===Imprisoned witnesses=== ====Shin Dong-hyuk==== In his official biography Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden, Shin Dong-hyuk claimed that he was born in the camp and lived there until escaping in his early twenties. In 2015, Shin recounted some of this story. Shin told Harden that he had changed some dates and locations and incorporated some \"fictive elements\" into his account. Harden outlined these revisions in a new foreword but did not revise the entire book. Shin said that he did not spend his entire North Korean life at Camp 14. Though maintaining that he was born there, he stated that, when he was young, his family was transferred to the less severe Camp 18, and spent several years there. He said that he was tortured in Camp 14 in 2002, as punishment for escaping from Camp 18. ====Kim Yong==== Kim Yong (1995\u20131996 in Kaechon, then in Bukchang) was imprisoned after it was revealed that the two men who were executed as alleged US spies were his father and brother. He witnessed approximately 25 executions in his section of the camp within less than two years. ==See also== * Camp 14: Total Control Zone * Human rights in North Korea * Kaechon concentration camp * Prisons in North Korea * Pukchang concentration camp * Slavery * Yodok concentration camp ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \u2013 Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea *North Korea: Political Prison Camps - Amnesty International document on conditions in North Korean prison camps (May 2011). * * * * * Witness accounts by North Korean refugees * * Detailed satellite images with comprehensive explanations Category:Concentration camps in North Korea Category:Incidents of cannibalism ",
