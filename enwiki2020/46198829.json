Her mother, Felipa Perozo, was an illiterate peasant who was left pregnant by Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, a wealthy merchant of the area who was also an officer in the army of Pedro Santana. Her mother first abandoned her, and then her father did the same when she was a child and her paternal grandmother took charge of her. Rodr\u00edguez's grandmother Tomasina Suero de Rod\u00edguez , was a marchanta (itinerant female vendor of homemade confections and sweets) in San Pedro de Macor\u00eds. Many of Rodr\u00edguez's family and friends called her Lilina as a nickname.

Her father would occasionally visit. == Career == === Medical career === At the age of 12 Rodr\u00edguez became a part- time home health aid to Dominican Poet and journalist Rafael Alfredo or \"Pepe C\u00e1ndido\" Deligne (1863-1902) [1], who had fallen ill to leprosy.
