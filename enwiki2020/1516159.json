    "text": "The Maddox Brothers and Rose, known as America\u2019s Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s, consisted of four brothers, Fred, Cal, Cliff, and Don Maddox, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956. ==Biography== The family hailed from Boaz, Alabama, United States, but rode the rails and hitch-hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 1930s. They struggled to make a living as itinerant fruit and vegetable pickers, following the harvest as far north as Washington and as far east as Arizona, as well as the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk, sleeping and eating on the ground.} Having settled in Modesto, California, the family developed their musical ability, and in 1937, performed on the radio, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939, they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centennial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage, they tore through \"Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down\" with rocking rhythms and risqu\u00e9 lyrics. They became, officially, California's best hillbilly band.Ramblin' Rose - The Life and Times of Rose Maddox. Jonny Whiteside. 1997. page 42. Lyrics The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angeles.Billboard, January 15, 1949, p. 33 From 1946-1951, the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood), then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. These quotes are from Rose Maddox: \"We were called hillbilly singers \u2014 not country \u2014 then. No, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang \u2014 country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.\" The Maddoxes\u2019 material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis, cowboy songs, to the Western swing of Bob Wills, to old-time, folk, and church singing, to jazz, swing, boogie-woogie, and even a taste of early rock and roll. Fred Maddox played upright bass using the \"slap bass\" technique as early as 1937. This trademark backbeat, a slapping bass style, helped drive a broad change in popular music, sporting a faster, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly. Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. \"They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.\"The Blue Moon Boys - The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 26. Don Maddox is the last surviving member of the band and lives in Ashland, Oregon.
