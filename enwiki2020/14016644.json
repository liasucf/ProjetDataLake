    "text": "The Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras (\u2013Boulogne\u2013Saint-Omer) (Latin: Dioecesis Atrebatensis (\u2013Bononiena\u2013Audomarensis); French: Dioc\u00e8se d'Arras (\u2013Boulogne\u2013Saint-Omer)) is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The episcopal see is the Arras Cathedral, in the city of Arras. The diocese encompasses all of the Department of Pas-de-Calais, in the Region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The most significant jurisdictional changes all occurred during the Napoleonic wars. From 1802 to 1841, the diocese was suffragan of the Archdiocese of Paris, shifting away from the Archdiocese of Cambrai, after Napoleon dissolved the massive Archdiocese. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Napoleonic Concordat united the diocese of Arras, diocese of Saint-Omer and diocese of Boulogne together in one much larger diocese. Unlike most of the other dioceses immediately restored, it was not until 1841 that the diocese returned as a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. ==History== A person named Martin is said to have evangelized Artois and Arras, capital of the Celtic Atrebates by 350AD; however, these early Christian communities did not survive the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire in the fifth century.Dioc\u00e8se d'Arras, Histoire du dioc\u00e8se d'Arras. Retrieved: 2016-09-02. At the beginning of the sixth century Remigius, Archbishop of Reims, placed in the See of Arras St. Vedastus (St. Vaast) (d. c. 540),For a recent revision of the legend of St. Remy and St. Vaast, see: K\u00e9ry, pp. 211-225. who had been the teacher of the Merovingian king Clovis I after the victory of Tolbiac. His successors, Dominicus and Vedulphus, are also both venerated as saints. After the death of Vedulphus, the See of Arras was transferred to Cambrai, and it was not until 1093 that Arras again became a diocese. At the time of the reform of the bishoprics of the Netherlands in 1559, the diocese had 422 parishes. Its metropolitan was changed from Reims to Cambrai by Pope Paul IV.12 May 1559: Gallia christiana III, pp. 318-321.

There were some 400 parishes and 12 rural deans. King Philip II of Spain and Pope Pius IV founded the University of Douai in 1562 as a weapon in the Counterreformation and the French Wars of Religion. The Jesuits had a college at Douai, founded in 1599, and suppressed in 1762.Gallia christiana III, pp. 318-319. Jean, p. 176. During the French revolution the diocese of Arras was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, the 'Pas de Calais', coterminous with the new 'Departement of the Pas-de- Calais', and a suffragan of the 'Metropole des C\u00f4tes de la Manche'. The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement. This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. On 27 March 1791 the electors chose, on the fourth ballot, the cur\u00e9 of Saint-Nicolas-sur-les-Foss\u00e9s at Arras, Pierre-Joseph Porion.Pisani, pp. 189-190.
