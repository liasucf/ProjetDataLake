The Cavaliers, led by seventh year head coach Joanne Boyle, played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena and were members the Atlantic Coast Conference. They finished the season 19\u201314, 10\u20136 in ACC play to finish in a 3-way tie for sixth place. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the ACC Women's Tournament where they lost to Notre Dame. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA Women's Tournament which was their first trip since 2009, where they defeated California first round before losing to South Carolina in the second round. On March 20, Boyle announced her retirement, initially citing an unspecified family matter. She would later reveal that she retired because of snags in her ongoing attempt to finalize the adoption of her Senegalese daughter. Boyle finished at Virginia with a record of 129\u201398. ==Roster== ==Schedule== |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00214E; color:#F56D22;\"|Non-conference regular season |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00214E; color:#F56D22;\"|ACC regular season |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00214E; color:#F56D22;\"| ACC Women's Tournament |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#00214E; color:#F56D22;\"| NCAA Women's Tournament ==Rankings== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;font-size:90%\" |- |+ Regular Season Polls !Poll !!
