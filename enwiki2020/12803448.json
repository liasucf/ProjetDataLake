    "text": "\"Walk Right Now\" is a 1981 song written, produced and performed by the Jacksons and issued as the fourth and final single from the group's popular album, Triumph. The song was written by Michael Jackson, Jackie Jackson and Randy Jackson and is a song in which a man is fed up with his lover's excuses about how they can resolve their relationship despite the woman's acts of infidelity towards him, therefore delivering the message, \"walk right now/I'm not playing\" in a chant-like phrase. When released, the song performed only modestly on US pop radio, peaking at a number seventy-three, but the song became a hit in the UK, where it peaked at number seven on the UK pop charts. The song was performed live, during the Jackson's Triumph Tour in 1981, but only for the first few shows, meaning a performance of the song is very hard to track down. ==Personnel== *Written and composed by Michael Jackson, Jackie Jackson and Randy Jackson *Produced by the Jacksons *Arranged by Michael Jackson *Lead vocals: Michael Jackson *Background vocals: The Jacksons *Instrumentation: **Piano: Greg Phillinganes **Synthesizers: Greg Phillinganes, Webster Lewis, Michael Boddicker **Guitars: Tito Jackson, David Williams **Bass: Nathan Watts **Drums: Ollie E.
