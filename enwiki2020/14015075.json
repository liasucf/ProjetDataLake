The domaine de Montbillon (the lands, now a large farm, of which the ch\u00e2teau was the centre) also included the \u00c9tang du lion (\"Lion's Pond\") now in the commune of Rocles. The Thonier family built some parts of the ch\u00e2teau and owned it for many years . ==External links== *Summed up and translated from the equivalent article at the French Wikipedia, 1 November 2007 Category:Houses completed in the 17th century Category:Houses completed in the 19th century Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Allier ",
