    "text": "Guan Ying (died 176 BC), posthumously known as Marquis Yi of Yingyin, was a Chinese general and chancellor of the Western Han dynasty. ==Life== Guan Ying was from Suiyang (\u7762\u967d; present-day Shangqiu, Henan). He served under Liu Bang (posthumously known as Emperor Gaozu), the founder of the Han dynasty, and joined him in rebelling against the Qin dynasty. He also fought on Liu Bang's side in the Chu\u2013Han Contention and assisted him in overcoming his rival, Xiang Yu. After the establishment of the Han dynasty, he served as the \"General of Chariots and Cavalry\" (). He assisted Liu Bang in putting down Chen Xi's rebellion, killing Chen's general Hou Chang ( H\u00f3u Ch\u01ceng) near Quni ( Q\u016bn\u00ec; around west of present-day Baoding, Hebei) in 196. Following Liu Bang's death, Empress L\u00fc and her clan seized power from the Liu family and controlled the Han government \u2013 this event is historically known as the L\u00fc Clan Disturbance. When the prince Liu Xiang rebelled against the L\u00fc clan, Guan Ying was appointed as \"General-in-Chief\" () and ordered to lead an army to suppress the revolt. However, he led his troops elsewhere instead and combined forces with Zhou Bo, Chen Ping and others who were loyal to the Liu family to oust the L\u00fc clan from power and install Liu Heng (Emperor Wen), a son of Liu Bang, on the throne. Emperor Wen appointed Guan Ying as the Grand Marshal () and subsequently promoted him to the position of Chancellor (). He died in office after about a year. He was given the posthumous name \"Marquis Yi\" (). ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Sima Qian et al. Records of the Grand Historian (Shi Ji) vol. 95. * Ban Gu et al.
