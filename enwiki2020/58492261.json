    "text": "Funtime, Inc was an American amusement and entertainment company located in Cleveland, Ohio. The company was established in 1965. It owned several properties throughout its 31-year-long lifespan. ==History== Funtime Inc. was established in 1965 when four former Cedar Point employees, including Gasper Lococo (1928\u20132016), a former military sergeant from Huron, pooled their resources and purchased Geauga Lake in Ohio for $5 million. The park had previously been owned by members of the Kuhlman/Schryer family. In 1983, the company began managing Wyandott Lake in Columbus, Ohio. That same year FunTime acquired 50% controlling interest in Darien Lake. In 1995, Funtime entered into an agreement to manage Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. ===Sale To Premier Parks=== In August 1995 Funtime, Inc. was acquired by Premier Parks for $60 million. The deal to manage Lake Compounce was canceled and the Kennywood Entertainment Company was awarded the contract. ==Properties== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:170px;\"| Name ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Location !
