An airstrip was constructed by the Brazilian Air Force to ease access to the remote area. Shortly after its creation, Aldeia Bona housed about 60% of the Apala\u00ed and Wayana population of the region. The concentration of the population mostly served the interests of the Brazilian government employees stationed in the village, however, and did not adhere to the criteria the indigenous Apala\u00ed and Wayana use for founding a village. Consequently, traditional settlement patterns, i.e. small villages of a few households spread out along a large area, reemerged after a while. Still, Aldeia Bona remains the largest Apala\u00ed-Wayana settlement on the Paru River and continues to serve as the access point to the area. == Demographics == In June 2016, Aldeia Bona had 267 inhabitants, of whom 157 were Apala\u00ed, 105 were Wayana and 5 were Tiriy\u00f3. == Notes == == References == * * * Category:Indigenous peoples in Brazil Category:Populated places in Par\u00e1 ",
