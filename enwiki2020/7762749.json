    "text": "Walter Pohl (born 27 December 1953, in Vienna) is an Austrian historian who is Professor of Auxiliary Sciences of History and Medieval History at the University of Vienna. He is a leading member of the Vienna School of History ==Biography== Walter Pohl was born in Vienna, Austria on 27 December 1953. He received his PhD at the University of Vienna in 1984 under the supervision of Herwig Wolfram with a thesis on the Pannonian Avars. He received his habilitation in medieval history at the University of Vienna in 1989. Pohl is a leading member of the European Science Foundation and the recipient of a large number of grants from the European Research Council. He was a key member of the Transformation of the Roman World project. In 2004, Pohl was elected Director of the Institute for Medieval Studies and Member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 2013, Pohl was elected a Member of Academia Europaea. ==Theories== Together with Wolfram, Pohl is a leading member of the Vienna School of History. However, he has a \"much more fluid\" approach on the issues than Wolfram or the latters mentor Reinhard Wenskus. Pohl's theories are \"profoundly influenced\" by sociology, the philosophy of language and critical theory. Pohl is well known for his theories about the Germanic peoples. Along with many of his fellow medieval historians in the Transformation of the Roman World project, Pohl believes that the Germanic peoples were not biologically related, had no institutions or values of their own, and made no contribution to the emergence of Medieval Europe. He regards the Germanic peoples as a merely a linguistic abstraction, and doubts whether ethnicity was important in antiquity.. \"Walter Pohl, Wolfram\u2019s successor in Vienna, is influenced by ethnogenesis theory, but he does not accept all of Wenskus\u2019s and Wolfram\u2019s ideas... [H]e rejects the idea of a German(ic)Volk or people, various tribes, as anything other than a linguistic abstraction... He raises a question that would have shocked Wenskus...\" Pohl treats the Germani strictly as a Roman construct existing from the 1st century BC to the 6th century AD. He does not consider language and culture as defining the Germani, and instead stresses fluidity, flexibility and ambiguity.. \"Pohl's Germani are not all Germani, but those encountered by the Romans on the Rhine and the upper Danube from about the first century B.C. to the sixth century A.D. He does not consider, for example, the Goths or the Franks of the Merovingian kingdoms... [Pohl] is dismissive of language and culture as determinants... of ethnic identity. He stresses fluidity, flexibility and ambiguity... As I read P.'s book, I was frequently struck by the thought that this is the conviction of those urging faster and closer European integration... Perhaps attempting to convince people that the societies they belong to are no more than ephemeral historical artefacts may in the end prove to be just as misguided as praising them for their racial, social and institutional purity.\" He does not count the Goths and Vandals among the Germani.. \"Pohl... explicitly excludes the Goths and Vandals from the Germani he is meant to be treating, before proceeding to retail their history at length.\" Pohl's views on the Germanic peoples have been criticized by Wolf Liebeschuetz as \"extraordinarily one-sided\" and a form of ideological \"dogmatism\" evincing \"a closed mind\".. \"Walter Pohl, had a completely closed mind to any view that admitted that these northern gentes had genuine histories and traditions of their own. Not content to demolish the view that these tribes were essentially racial organizations, they relied on sociological theory that ethnicity is nothing more than a negotiated system of social classification... to deny these peoples any institutions and values of their own, and so to reduce their contribution to medieval Europe to nothing at all. Such dogmatism is easily explained as a reaction to Nazi racism but it is nevertheless extraordinarily one-sided...\" John F. Drinkwater has suggested that Pohl's theories on Germanic peoples are motivated by a desire to accelerate European integration. ==Bibliography== Works in English translation.
