    "text": "The Rojas family, more commonly known in English-speaking America by their matronym, Alou, is a prominent Major League Baseball family from the Dominican Republic. The family name in the Dominican Republic is the paternal family name of Rojas, but Felipe Alou and his brothers became known by the name Alou when the Giants' scout who signed Felipe mistakenly thought his matronym (Alou) was his surname. The Rojas Alou brothers' maternal grandfather, Mateu Alou, was an immigrant from Felanitx, Spain, who immigrated to the Dominican Republic in 1898. In 1963, while all playing for the San Francisco Giants, Felipe, Matty and Jesus became the first all brother outfield in the Major Leagues. Felipe Alou, the oldest of three brothers, was the first Dominican to play regularly in the Major Leagues. From 1958-1974, he played for the San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves, Oakland A's, the New York Yankees and the Montreal Expos. He made the All-Star team three times and once finished 5th in the MVP voting.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aloufe01.shtml His younger brothers Matty and Jes\u00fas were both longtime National League outfielders. Felipe's son Mois\u00e9s, is also a former Major League outfielder. Luis Rojas, also a son of Felipe, was named manager of the New York Mets on January 22, 2020.https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28538338/mets-close- naming-luis-rojas-new-manager-gm-brodie-van-wagenen-says All but Jes\u00fas have been named All-Stars at least twice.
