    "text": "Pa\u00f1cavidy\u0101 (Sanskrit) are five classes of knowledge (vidy\u0101) of ancient India. The five sciences are: science of language (\u015babda vidy\u0101), science of logic (hetu vidy\u0101), science of medicine (cikits\u0101 vidy\u0101), science of fine arts and crafts (\u015bilpa-karma-sth\u0101na vidy\u0101), and science of spirituality (adhy\u0101tma vidy\u0101). The first four are common for all schools and the latter is the theory of each school of thought; for example, it is the Tripitaka for Buddhists, and the four Vedas for Brahmins. In the Buddhist context, a recognized master of all five sciences was afforded the title pa\u1e47\u1e0dita. ==Notes== Category:Buddhist terminology Category:Tibetan Buddhism in India Category:Sanskrit words and phrases ",
