She served as a municipal councillor of Reykjavik from 1908 to 1916. ==Biography== Born on 18 March 1858 on the island of Hrappsey in north-western Iceland, Katr\u00edn Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Sk\u00falad\u00f3ttir was the daughter of Sk\u00fali \u00deorvaldsson S\u00edvertsson, a farmer, and his wife Hl\u00edf J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. Raised on Hrappsey, she first went to Reykjavik when she was 14 to visit her paternal aunt, Katr\u00ednar S\u00edvertsen. There she met Gu\u00f0mundur Magnusson, a physician and academic, who was a relative of Katr\u00ednar's husband, J\u00f3ni \u00c1rnasyn. She married Gu\u00f0mundur in 1891 and they moved to Copenhagen. They returned to Iceland the following year, settling in Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur after her husband received an appointment at the hospital in Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. Kartr\u00edn was also interested in medical work but the only training open to women was for midwives, which she did not find attractive. She nevertheless constantly helped her husband, sometimes taking care of his patients. Katr\u00edn became active in social affairs, especially in connection with women's organizations. She joined the Icelandic Women's Association (\u00cdslenska kvenf\u00e9lag) which she chaired from 1903 to 1924. In 1917, she helped to establish the Women's Alliance (Bandalags kvenna). She also served on the board of Thorvaldsensf\u00e9lag (the Thorvaldsen Association), Iceland's oldest women's organization established in 1875. Interested in education, she participated in the school committee at Reyhjavik's Kvennask\u00f3lan (Women's School). Katr\u00edn was one of four women who sat on Reykjavik's municipal council from 1908 to 1916. Katr\u00edn Magn\u00fasson died in Reykjavik on 13 July 1932. ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1932 deaths Katrin Magnusson Katrin Magnusson Category:Icelandic women's rights activists Katrin Magnusson ",
