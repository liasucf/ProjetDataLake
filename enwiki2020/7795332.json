The holy day celebrates the birth of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. The 2020 date is October 19.http://bahaiblog.net/site/bahai-calendar/ Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h was born on 12 November 1817 in Tehran, Iran, and this holy day was instituted in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, his book of laws, where Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h first refers to four great festivals: the Festival of Ridv\u00e1n, the Declaration of the B\u00e1b, the birth of the B\u00e1b\u2014who is considered to be a Manifestation of God, and who foretold the coming of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h\u2014and the birth of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. In questions submitted to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h after writing the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h states that the two days commemorating the births of the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h are seen to be one in the \"sight of God\" and are referred to as the \"Twin Birthdays\". \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, the son of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, stated that during the holy day the community should rejoice together to increase the unity of the community. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds usually observe the holy day with community gatherings where prayers are shared and the birth of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h is celebrated. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h stated that in communities where the majority of the population are Shi\u02bba Muslims, such as Iran, his followers should exercise caution in celebrating the twin birthdays so that they do not upset the majority of the population who are mourning during the Islamic month of Muharram. In the Islamic calendar, which is a lunar calendar, the two holy days fall on consecutive days: the birth of the B\u00e1b is on the first day of Muharram in 1235 AH (20 October 1819), and the birth of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h is on the second day of Muharram in 1233 AH (12 November 1817). Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h stated that if the holy days occur during the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed month of fasting, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds need not observe the fast those days. Since the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar is a solar calendar, the decision to celebrate the Twin Holy Birthdays in a solar or lunar basis remains to the Universal House of Justice. Until March 20, 2015, in most of the world, the holy day was celebrated according to the solar year on 12 November, and the birth of the B\u00e1b was celebrated on 20 October. Since days in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar start at sunset, the holy day started on the evening of 11 November and proceeded until sunset on 12 November. However, in 2014, the Universal House of Justice decided to celebrate the twin holy days on the first and second day following the eighth new moon after Naw-R\u00faz, starting from March 20, 2015 onwards. Thus from March 20, 2015 onward the day where the Birth of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h is celebrated will change from year to year. == References == == Further reading == * Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre (2017).
