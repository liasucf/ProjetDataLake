    "text": "A remix album is an album consisting of remixes or rerecorded versions of an artist's earlier released material. The first act who employed the format was American singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson (Aerial Pandemonium Ballet, 1971). As of 2007, the best-selling remix album of all time was Michael Jackson's Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997). ==History and concept== Aerial Pandemonium Ballet (1971) by Harry Nilsson is credited as the first remix album. It was released after the successes of \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and The Point!, after he decided that his older material had started to sound dated. But the concept of the remix album itself dates back to the 1980s, when record companies would slap together several kinds of electronic dance music, such as dance-pop, house, techno, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, hardstyle, and trap into full-length albums, creating a relatively low-overhead addition to the catalogs and balance sheets. Since this time this kind of release is seen as an easy cash-in for an artist and their label but also as an oportunity to a second lease of life into a record. In the world of reggae music, it is not uncommon for a whole album to be remixed in a dub style.Dub: soundscapes and shattered songs in Jamaican reggae, p.2Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 () Jennifer Lopez's album J to tha L\u2013O!
