The 2021\u201322 season will be their inaugural season in Blackfalds. == History == After several seasons of struggling financially, the Calgary Mustangs of the AJHL commenced negotiations to relocate its franchise to Strathmore. After the relocation deal fell through, the team requested a leave of absence from the AJHL for the 2019\u201320 season. The AJHL approved the request in May 2019, allowing the Calgary Mustangs to explore either a more viable future in Calgary or a relocation. A few months later, the AJHL approved the purchase of the Mustangs by Doug Quinn, a businessman from Red Deer, and the relocation of the franchise to Blackfalds to begin play in the 2021\u201322 season. The franchise announced its team name, the Blackfalds Bulldogs, in April 2020. == Season-by-season record == For previous teams' records, see Calgary Mustangs.
