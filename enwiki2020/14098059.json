    "text": "KVLI (1140 AM) is a commercial radio station that is licensed to Lake Isabella, California, United States. The station, a 1,000-watt daytimer, is owned by Craig and Patricia Lutz, through licensee Alta Sierra Broadcasting LLC, and broadcasts a news/talk format. KVLI features programming from ABC Radio, Premiere Radio Networks, and Salem Communications. 1140 AM is a United States and Mexican clear-channel frequency. ==History== KVLI first signed on July 15, 1977. It featured a variety format that included top 40, middle of the road (MOR), and country music. In August 2014, Robert J. Bohn and Katherine M. Bohn sold KVLI and sister station KRVQ-FM to Alta Sierra Broadcasting, LLC for $300,000. However, the transaction triggered a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which held up the deal for three years. Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, licensee of KWVE-FM, alleged that a time brokerage agreement (TBA) between the sellers and Alta Sierra constituted an unauthorized transfer of control because KVLI and KRVQ-FM had no staff on premises. The FCC agreed, levying an $8,000 fine against the Bohns in a consent decree. The penalty was later reduced to $6,000, and the sale closed in July 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Kern River Radio Facebook * VLI VLI Category:Radio stations established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in California ",
