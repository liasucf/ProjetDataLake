Their type genus Danaus contains the well-known monarch butterfly (D. plexippus) and is also the type genus of the tribe's subfamily, the milkweed butterflies (Danainae). The Danaini do not have a fixed colloquial name for the entire tribe, but in particular for subtribe Danaina the term tiger butterflies is occasionally used in reference to the numerous species in several genera. ==Classification== Subtribe Danaina Boisduval, [1833] * Amauris \u2013 clerics * Danaus \u2013 monarchs, queens and tigers * Ideopsis \u2013 glassy tigers, Southeast Asian tree- and wood-nymphs * Parantica \u2013 tigers * Tiradelphe \u2013 Schneider's surprise * Tirumala \u2013 blue tigers Subtribus Euploeina Moore, [1880] * Anetia \u2013 anetias and false \"fritillaries\" * Euploea \u2013 crows * Idea \u2013 tree nymphs, paper butterflies * Lycorea \u2013 mimic queens * Protoploea \u2013 magpie butterfly The fossil milkweed butterfly Archaeolycorea from the Oligocene or Miocene Trememb\u00e9 Formation of Brazil is often assigned to this tribe, specifically the Euploeina.
