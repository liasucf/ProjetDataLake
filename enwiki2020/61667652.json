    "text": "Helen Laird (1874\u20131957), was an Irish actress also known as \u2018Honor Lavelle\u2019, a costumier, teacher, and feminist. ==Life and acting== Laird was born on 12 April 1874 in Limerick to John Laird and Marion Seymour. Her father was a protestant pharmacist. When she was about 24 she joined both the Gaelic League and Inghinidhe na h\u00c9ireann. Laird met other Irish actors and dramatists including M\u00e1ire Nic Shiubhlaigh, M\u00e1ire Quinn, and Padraic Colum as well as taking drama classes there. There Willie and Frank Fay founded W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company with a production \u2018Deirdre\u2019 by AE and \u2018Cathleen ni Houlihan\u2019 by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory starring Maud Gonne. Laird was the costumier and set painter. The group then formed the Irish National Theatre Society and together they became the foundation of the Abbey company. In 1902 Laird appeared in \u2018Laying the foundations\u2019, by Fred Ryan using the stage name, \u2018Honor Lavelle\u2019. She appeared in most of the following productions including what was her most important role as Maurya in the first production of \u2018Riders to the sea\u2019 by J. M. Synge in 1903. While she was not normally critically received as an excellent actor she gained praise for her performances in this role. Yeats initially praised her performance in \u2018Cathleen ni Houlihan\u2019 but later changed his mind about her acting skills. In 1906 she sided against Yeats in the discussion about the Abbey being a commercial organisation. She sided with Edward Martyn. They went on to form the alternative Theatre of Ireland with Nic Shiubhlaigh, Seumas O'Sullivan and others. The first production included \u2018The racing lug\u2019 by James Cousins and \u2018Casadh-an-ts\u00fag\u00e1n\u2019 by Douglas Hyde. Laird had roles in these. During most of this time she lived in Fairview, Dublin. ==Other activism== During the time that Laird was as an actress she was also a science teacher in the girl's school, Alexandra College, Dublin. She wrote articles on botany for various publications. Laird was friends with Robert Lloyd Praeger Augustine Henry, and Grenville Cole. As a member of both the Gaelic League and Inginidhe na h\u00c9ireann, and friends with Maud Gonne and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, Laird was active in politics and was a member of the Irish Women's Franchise League. She and Gonne formed the Ladies\u2019 School Dinners Committee, which ensured 450 children from Dublin's poorest schools were fed in 1911. In 1912 Laird was sent to London by the IWFL to enfranchise 100,000 women through Philip Snowden's clause in the home rule bill. ==Personal life== Laired married lawyer and critic Con Curran on 17 December 1913. She continued costuming, for \u2018Uncle Vanya\u2019 and acting in P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire's \u2018Bairbre Ruadh\u2019 using the Irish version of her name, \u2018Eibhlis nic a Bhaird\u2019. She worked with the Save the Children Fund for thirty years. Laird lived in Rathgar, Dublin and had a daughter, the art critic Elizabeth Curran. Laird died on 5 October 1957 in Dublin and was buried in Deansgrange cemetery. Her funeral was a large affair attended by the Irish President Sean T O'Kelly. ==References and sources== Category:1874 births Category:1957 deaths Category:20th-century Irish actresses Category:Irish suffragists Category:Irish women's rights activists ",
