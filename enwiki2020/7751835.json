James Rosati (1911 in Washington, Pennsylvania 1911 - 1988 in New York City) was an American abstract sculptor. ==Life== Born near Pittsburgh, Rosati moved to New York in 1944, where he befriended fellow sculptor Phillip Pavia. He was a charter member of the Eighth Street Club (the Club) and the New York School of abstract expressionists. Rosati was among the participants in the 9th Street Art Exhibition and the subsequent Stable Gallery shows. He met and became friends with painters Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, and sculptor David Smith. He was awarded the Mr and Mrs Frank G.
