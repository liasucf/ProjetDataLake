Its name comes from a waterway that goes through the capital. The wadi is inhabited by the Oulad Tidrarin Sahrawi tribe. Occupying the northern part of Western Sahara, it lay between the 26th parallel north and 27\u00b050'N. The city of Cape Bojador served to divide the regions. Its colonial capital was El Aai\u00fan (La\u00e2youne), and it also included the city of Smara. The territory takes its name from an intermittent river, the Saguia el- Hamra, the route of which runs west from south of El Farcya to reach the Atlantic at Laayoune. The area is roughly , making it approximately a third of the entire Western Sahara. == References == Category:Former Spanish colonies Category:Geography of Western Sahara Category:States and territories established in 1969 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1975 Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Spanish Sahara ",
