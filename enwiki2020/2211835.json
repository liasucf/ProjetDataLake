    "text": "Lustre is a formally defined, declarative, and synchronous dataflow programming language for programming reactive systems. It began as a research project in the early 1980s. A formal presentation of the language can be found in the 1991 Proceedings of the IEEE. N. Halbwachs et al. The Synchronous Data Flow Programming Language LUSTRE. In Proc. IEEE 1991 Vol. 79, No. 9. Accessed 17 March 2014. In 1993 it progressed to practical, industrial use in a commercial product as the core language of the industrial environment SCADE, developed by Esterel Technologies. It is now used for critical control software in aircraft, helicopters, and nuclear power plants. ==Structure of Lustre programs== A Lustre program is a series of node definitions, written as: node foo(a : bool) returns (b : bool); let b = not a; tel Where `foo` is the name of the node, `a` is the name of the single input of this node and `b` is the name of the single output. In this example the node `foo` returns the negation of its input `a`, which is the expected result. ===Inner variables=== Additional internal variables can be declared as follows: node Nand(X,Y: bool) returns (Z: bool); var U: bool; let U = X and Y; Z = not U; tel Note: The equations order doesn't matter, the order of lines `U = X and Y;` and `Z = not U;` doesn't change the result. ===Special operators=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | `pre` p || Returns the previous value of p |- | p `->` q || Set p as the initial value of the expression q |- |} ==Examples== ===Edge detection=== node Edge (X : bool) returns (E : bool); let E = false -> X and not pre X; tel ==See also== *Esterel *SIGNAL (another dataflow-oriented synchronous language) *Synchronous programming language *Dataflow programming ==References== ==External links== *Synchrone Lab Official website *SCADE product page Category:Declarative programming languages Category:Synchronous programming languages Category:Hardware description languages Category:Formal methods Category:Software modeling language ",
