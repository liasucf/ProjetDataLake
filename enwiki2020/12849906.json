    "text": "The U.S. Army Airborne & Special Operations Museum (ASOM) is part of the United States Army Museum System. Located near Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina, it has been open to the public since 2000. Its emphasis is on United States military history especially U.S. Army airborne and special operations forces. In October 2013 the ASOM opened the \"Task Force Ranger and the Battle of Mogadishu Exhibit.\" The exhibit features immersive dioramas and artifacts from the battle including the wreckage of Super 6-1, the first Black Hawk helicopter shot down during the battle, and Super 6-4. The downing of Super 6-1 is widely considered to be a turning point in the battle and is chronicled in the book by Mark Bowden and movie Black Hawk Down produced by Ridley Scott. In late 2016 the museum is planning an exhibit dedicated to the \"Monuments Men.\" The exhibit will display artifacts, artwork and other items related to their work protecting artistic treasures during World War II. ==Other Army museums== :See: National Museum of the United States Army ==See also== *List of museums in the United States *82nd Airborne Division War Memorial Museum, a similar museum at nearby Fort Bragg, North Carolina ==References== ==External links== *The Airborne & Special Operations Museum official website *Disability, USA, Super 6-1, Cosmic Roulette, CBS 60 Minutes *Black Hawk Down, Philadelphia Inquirer Category:Airborne warfare Category:Fayetteville, North Carolina Category:Museums established in 2000 Category:Museums in Cumberland County, North Carolina Category:United States Army museums Category:Military and war museums in North Carolina Category:2000 establishments in North Carolina ",
