    "text": "Rafael Ferdinand van der Vaart (; born 11 February 1983) is a Dutch professional darts player and former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. Van der Vaart began his career at Ajax's youth academy and worked his way into the first team, debuting as a 17-year-old. Known for his playmaking skills, he drew comparisons to Johan Cruyff. He was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year and became the first recipient of the Golden Boy Award while at the club. He moved to Bundesliga club Hamburger SV, then to Real Madrid, then on to Tottenham Hotspur before returning to Hamburg in 2012. In the latter stages of his career, Van der Vaart had brief spells playing in Spain and Denmark before announcing his retirement in 2018, and return in 2019 with a testimonial match. Van der Vaart earned 109 caps for the Netherlands between 2001 and 2013. He represented the country at three UEFA European Championships and two FIFA World Cups, reaching the final in 2010. In 2019, van der Vaart began his darts career, joining the British Darts Organisation. ==Early life== Van der Vaart was born in Heemskerk to a Dutch father and a Spanish mother from Chiclana de la Frontera, C\u00e1diz. Before joining Ajax, he played for a local club called De Kennemers based in Beverwijk. He grew up on a trailer park, living a \"gypsy life\", and often pretended to be Rom\u00e1rio while playing football. It was at the trailer park that he learned how to play football and, at the age of ten, he joined the AFC Ajax Academy. Van der Vaart has said of his upbringing, \"That was the way my family lived. My father was born there and it is a lifestyle. Maybe it is not a normal lifestyle but I always liked it. I always played football on the street. It was an easy life, then I was 10 years old and went to Ajax and played there for almost 12 years.\"Van der Vaart: I can help Spurs overtake Arsenal this season \"Mirror Football\", 9 September 2010 ==Club career== ===Ajax=== Van der Vaart came through the ranks at Ajax with national teammates John Heitinga and Wesley Sneijder. Initially, he signed for Ajax on a trial basis as a ten-year-old, but was eventually enrolled permanently after impressing the coaches. At the age of 17, Van der Vaart made his debut for the Ajax senior side in a 1\u20131 draw with FC Den Bosch on 19 April 2000 in the 1999\u201300 season. After he broke into the Ajax first team, Van der Vaart was \"hailed as the new Johan Cruyff\".\"Rafael van der Vaart refuses to play the envy game with Wesley Sneijder\". The Guardian. Retrieved 9 December 2010.\"Rafael van der Vaart looking for silverware at Tottenham to end his personal drought\". The People. Retrieved 6 November 2011. Van der Vaart was with Ajax from 1993 to 2005. In the 2000\u201301 season, Ajax manager Co Adriaanse increased Van der Vaart's playing time by moving him to the attacking midfielder position. He was voted European Talent of the Year by Italian football website CalcioManager. The next season, Van der Vaart suffered a serious knee injury and was out for several months. Shortly after returning to action, he re-injured the same knee on 2 April 2002, requiring an operation that involved the removal of his entire meniscus This injury forced him to miss the run-in to Ajax\u2019s successful Eredivisie campaign and their Dutch Cup triumph against Utrecht in the 2001\u201302 season, but it did not stop him being named the Netherlands' Talent of the Year. In 2002\u201303, Ajax won the Amsterdam Tournament, though injury limited Van der Vaart to 21 league appearances, in which he scored 18 goals. After his return to fitness, he scored a vital goal in the UEFA Champions League away to Lyon, which propelled Ajax into the knockout stages. In the first half of 2003\u201304, his performances were poor. Van der Vaart admitted he was overweight, and the media criticized his celebrity lifestyle with his then-fianc\u00e9e, The Music Factory VJ Sylvie Meis. He became an influential figure once again as Ajax claimed another league title. By that stage, Van der Vaart had firmly established himself as one of the stars of the Ajax team, as well as one of the most popular players in the Netherlands. Van der Vaart was named team captain by coach Ronald Koeman for the 2004\u201305 season. During an international match against Sweden on 18 August 2004, he was injured by then-Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, which led to the sale of Ibrahimovi\u0107 to Juventus two weeks later, following controversial accusations that the Swede had intentionally tried to hurt Van der Vaart. As a result, Van der Vaart took Ibrahimovi\u0107's spot as striker.Player profile: Rafa\u00ebl van der Vaart Footy Mania He was unhappy at being played out of position, and following his refusal to play on the wing in a Champions League match in December, he was stripped of the team captaincy by Koeman. In September, a league match against ADO Den Haag was temporarily halted by the officials due to incessant chants by opposing fans directed at Meis.Whatever happened to Rafael van der Vaart? \u2013 BBC Sport, 7 December 2005 The incident, coupled with his ongoing injury problems that resulted in an average of only 23 league appearances in five seasons with Ajax, led him to announce that he was leaving the club at the end of the year. ===Hamburger SV=== At this point, Van der Vaart's performances were attracting interest from some of Europe\u2019s top clubs. He had previously been strongly linked to Milan, but in the summer of 2005, he signed for Bundesliga outfit Hamburger SV in Germany. Van der Vaart's \u20ac5.5 million transfer to Hamburg, on 1 June 2005,Ajax agrees to transfer midfielder Van der Vaart to Hamburg People's Daily, 1 June 2005 raised many eyebrows. Many other top-flight clubs had shown interest in the midfielder but he chose Hamburg. Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his De Telegraaf column, \"I don't know what to say about it or what Rafael van der Vaart is doing in Hamburg.\" He played a massive part in Hamburg\u2019s impressive away form that season, scoring in each of their first four games on the road; in fact, in the course of his first one and a half seasons with the German club, they did not lose a single match away from home while he was on the pitch. Van der Vaart finished his first season as the team's top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He assumed the team captaincy for the 2006\u201307 season. This season proved to be a difficult one for his club, and despite Van der Vaart's three goals in the Champions League group stages, they made an early exit from the competition, while languishing for several months in the bottom half of the Bundesliga table as Van der Vaart was troubled by injuries throughout the season. The arrival of Van der Vaart's countryman Huub Stevens as head coach, however, saw Hamburg march up the standings and they finished the season in a respectable seventh place, qualifying for, and also winning, the Intertoto Cup. After garnering interest from Real Madrid from Spain, Van der Vaart responded by saying, \"I am set to spend another season in Hamburg,\" of which he told Welt am Sonntag. He further added, \"Now we have the team to achieve something.\" In the 2007\u201308 season, Van der Vaart scored 12 league goals as Hamburg finished fourth in the league, while reaching the round of 16 in the UEFA Cup. During the UEFA Cup away win at FC Z\u00fcrich, he tore ankle ligaments and was out of action for several weeks.

He signed a five-year contract for an undisclosed amount. Van der Vaart debuted in a 2\u20131 pre-season win four days later, against Colombian side Independiente Santa F\u00e9, where he scored the equalising goal and provided an assist for the winner. He changed his squad number from 19 to his favored number 23 after teammate Wesley Sneijder took number 10 following Robinho's departure to Manchester City on 31 August. He marked his league debut for Real Madrid with a strike against Numancia in a 4\u20133 victory. On 24 September, he scored his first career hat-trick in a 7\u20131 thrashing of Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. In October 2008, Van der Vaart was one of the many La Liga players to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or, but the award eventually went to Manchester United forward and future teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.Ronaldo wins Ballon d'Or Sky Sports, 2 December 2008 For the latter part of the 2008\u201309 season, Van der Vaart was mostly utilized as an impact substitute by coach Juande Ramos, which led to speculations of a fall-out between coach and player.

Van der Vaart was handed his original number 23 jersey while Granero was given number 24. After a wait of four games, Van der Vaart was finally included in Pellegrini's squad list to face Villarreal on 23 September.

He scored his last goal for Real Madrid against M\u00e1laga on 16 May 2010.

However, with the transfers on the last couple of days of the window of Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey from Fulham and the earlier addition of Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson, it became clear that Spurs had a glut of new midfield talent which would have reduced any game time for Van der Vaart. ===Return to Hamburg=== Hamburg in 2013 On 31 August 2012, Van der Vaart returned to his former club, Hamburger SV.

In the opening game of the competition, the Dutch team won 3\u20130 against the world champions Italy with Van der Vaart playing a role in the build-ups. Van Basten decided to field him again in the starting line-up in the next match against France; the Oranje later went on to win 4\u20131. ===2010 World Cup=== Despite enduring a tough time at club level,Battler Van der Vaart out of Real shadows AFP, 4 July 2010 Van der Vaart remained a first-choice player for Van Basten's successor Bert van Marwijk in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.
