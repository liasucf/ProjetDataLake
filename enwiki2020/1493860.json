    "text": "The Loisach is a river that flows through Tyrol, Austria and Bavaria, Germany. Its name might be Celtic in origin, from Proto-Celtic *lawo and *isk\u0101, both of which mean \"water\". But the suffix -ach is Germanic or pre-Germanic. Another possibility would be that Lois might be cognate with basque lohi(tz) \"mud, swamp\" (cf. Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in basque Donibane-Lohitzune). The Loisach goes through the great swamp . The Loisach is a left tributary to the Isar. The source of the Loisach is near Ehrwald in Austria. The Loisach flows past Garmisch-Partenkirchen and into the Kochelsee. At the Kochelsee the water that was diverted from the upper river Isar for the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station joins the Loisach. The Loisach then flows out of Kochelsee and joins the Isar at Wolfratshausen. A canal joins the Isar and the Loisach returning the water diverted for power generation to the Isar before Wolfratshausen to reduce the risk of flooding in the town. ==References== Category:Rivers of Bavaria Category:Rivers of Tyrol (state) Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of Austria Category:Rivers of Germany ",
