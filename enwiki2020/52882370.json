During his first year as a scholar, he scored 16 goals for the under-18 team as they finished third in the Youth Alliance South East Conference. The following season, Banton signed a professional contract on 19 September 2013 until May 2015. He made his first-team debut five days later aged 17 as an 85th-minute substitute for Andre Gray in a 4\u20130 win over Woking. His first start came on 30 November in a 0\u20130 draw with Staines Town in the FA Trophy first round, before being substituted in the 60th minute. Banton joined Conference South club Concord Rangers on a one-month loan on 5 March 2014. At the time, Luton manager John Still said he hoped Banton's loan spell would help to aid his development and \"might push him on a little bit\". He debuted two days later in a 3\u20132 win over Eastleigh and completed the loan spell with three appearances. On 8 August 2014, Banton joined Southern League Premier Division club Biggleswade Town on a three-month loan. He made his debut a day later as a 69th-minute substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to Chippenham Town. Banton scored his first goal for Biggleswade in a 4\u20131 win over Dorchester Town on 23 August. He added a second goal to his Biggleswade tally in a 1\u20130 win over Burnham on 9 September. Banton scored in three consecutive matches in all competitions from September to October and made his final appearance for Biggleswade in a 3\u20133 draw with Slough Town on 28 October. He finished the loan spell with six goals from 21 appearances. Banton was recalled from his loan at Biggleswade on 31 October, and joined Conference South club Hemel Hempstead Town later that day on loan until 29 November. He debuted in a 1\u20130 win over Bromley on 11 November. Banton made four further appearances in all competitions and scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over Truro City in the FA Trophy third qualifying round on 29 November. He rejoined Hemel Hempstead Town on loan until the end of the season at the beginning of January 2015. On 21 September 2015, Banton joined National League club Boreham Wood on a one-month loan. He debuted in a 2\u20131 win away to Torquay United and completed the loan spell with two appearances. Banton later rejoined Hemel Hempstead Town on a one-month youth loan until 9 January 2016, starting in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Ebbsfleet United on 5 December. In the following match, Banton scored in a 7\u20134 defeat away to Eastbourne Borough in the FA Trophy on 12 December. Banton's loan was extended for a second month on 13 January 2016 until 14 February, with an immediate recall option. Luton exercised the option to recall Banton on 30 January with immediate effect to allow him to be named on the bench for the match at home to Notts County, which finished as a 2\u20130 defeat. Banton made his Football League debut as a 73rd-minute substitute for Jonathan Smith in a 2\u20130 defeat at home to Accrington Stanley on 9 April. This was followed up with three further substitute appearances, and finished 2015\u201316 with four appearances for Luton. Banton signed a new one-year contract after the end of the season, with the option of a one-year extension. ===St Albans City=== On 24 March 2017, Banton joined National League South club St Albans City on loan until the end of 2016\u201317. He debuted a day later in a 1\u20130 win at home to Dartford. Banton scored his first goal for St Albans on 15 April in a 1\u20131 draw with Whitehawk, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 3\u20130 victory at home to Weston-super-Mare. He was recalled by Luton on 27 April, having scored twice in six appearances for St Albans. Banton was released by Luton when his contract expired at the end of 2016\u201317.
