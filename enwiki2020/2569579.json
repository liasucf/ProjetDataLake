    "text": "Niepce is a crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies in the high northern latitudes, just behind the north-northwestern limb. Less than a crater diameter to the north is the crater Merrill, and just to the west is Mezentsev. Farther to the south-southeast is N\u00f6ther. This is a worn crater formation with rim features that have been softened and rounded by subsequent deposits of ejecta. Attached to the eastern rim is the satellite crater Niepce F, and the inner wall of Niepce is wider along this edge. The remaining interior floor is relatively level, and offset toward the western side. There are several small impacts on the floor, the largest being a small craterlet along the north-northeastern edge. Just along the southwest rim edge is a small, teardrop-shaped crater that was likely created by a low angle impact. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Niepce. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Niepce !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|F |align=\"center\"|72.5\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|113.5\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|44 km |} == Name == The crater is named after Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce who is widely credited for having taken the first ever permanent photograph in 1825. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Digital Lunar Orbiter Photo Number V-006-H3 Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
