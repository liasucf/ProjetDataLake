    "text": "Geoffrey Kiprono Mutai (born 7 October 1981) is a Kenyan long distance runner who specialises in road running competitions. On 18 April 2011 at the Boston Marathon, Mutai ran the fastest marathon ever at the time in a time of 2 hours 3 minutes 2 seconds (4:41 per mile pace / 2:54 per kilometer pace), though the time was not recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations as a world record since the Boston course does not meet the criteria to be eligible for the mark. His other significant victories include the Monaco Marathon. He is also a strong half marathon runner, with wins at the Valencia Half Marathon and RAK Half Marathon, and a best of 58 minutes 58 seconds, to his name. He also won the 2011 New York City Marathon with a time of 2 hours 5 minutes and 5 seconds (4:46 per mile pace), breaking the course record set by Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia in 2001,Liz Robbins, Geoffrey Mutai Wins New York Marathon With Course Record, The New York Times, 6 November 2011 and repeated his performance at the 2013 New York City Marathon with a time of 2 hours 8 minutes and 24 seconds. ==Career== Mutai started running in 1994 while at Tuiyotich Primary School in Nakuru. He graduated from primary school in 1998, but financial constraints prevented him from joining a secondary school. Instead, he worked in a farm, but continued his running career. He was selected to represent Kenya at the 2002 World Junior Championships, but could not make the trip as he had no birth certificate. Soon after he was injured and almost quit running. He later joined Kapng'entuny Athletics Club in Eldoret. In 2007 he made his marathon debut, finishing second in the inaugural Kass Marathon in Eldoret. At this race he met his current manager Gerard Van de Veen of Volare Sports, who provided him with the opportunity of competing abroad.Daily Nation. 24 April 2011: Rags to riches28 February 2011: Focus on Athletes \u2013 Geoffrey Kiprono MUTAI He won the 2008 Monaco Marathon, clocking a time of 2:12:40 to beat second-placed Jacob Kitur.Mutai clocks 2:12 to take 11th edition of Monaco Marathon.
