Known as Herman by teammates after his resemblance to popular television character Herman Munster, he played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a front rower for the Manly-Warringah and North Sydney clubs, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with the Sea Eagles. He also gained selection for the Australia on the 1973 Kangaroo Tour though he only played in eight minor matches and didn't play a test. Unwanted by Manly at the end of 1974, he went on to captain the North Sydney Bears, bringing much needed discipline to a club regarded as 'easybeats'. Hamilton captain-coached the club to their last major trophy the Channel 10 Challenge Cup in 1978. In 2010 he was named at prop forward in Kurri Rugby League Club's team of the century. A retired policeman, Bill Hamilton lives in Tea Gardens on the NSW Mid North Coast where he has given a lot of his time to the Men of League Foundation.1973 NSWRFL Grand Final - Manly players 40 years later ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles captains Category:North Sydney Bears players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Kurri Kurri Bulldogs players Category:New South Wales rugby league team players Category:Living people Category:Rugby league props ",
