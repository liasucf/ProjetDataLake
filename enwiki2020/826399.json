    "text": "Four Surrealist Manifestos are known to exist. The first two manifestos, published in October 1924, were written by Yvan Goll and Andr\u00e9 Breton, the leaders of rivaling Surrealist groups. Breton published his second manifesto for the Surrealists in 1929, and wrote his third manifesto that was not issued during his lifetime. ==First manifestos== Yvan Goll, Surr\u00e9alisme, Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme,Surr\u00e9alisme, Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme, Volume 1, Number 1, 1 October 1924, Blue Mountain Project Volume 1, Number 1, October 1, 1924, cover by Robert Delaunay Leading up to 1924, two rival surrealist groups had formed. Each group claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Guillaume Apollinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll, consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Derm\u00e9e, C\u00e9line Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlev\u00e9 and Robert Delaunay, among others.G\u00e9rard Durozoi, An excerpt from History of the Surrealist Movement, Chapter Two, 1924-1929, Salvation for Us Is Nowhere, translated by Alison Anderson, University of Chicago Press, pp. 63-74, 2002 The other group, led by Breton, included Louis Aragon, Robert Desnos, Paul \u00c9luard, Jacques Baron, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Boiffard, Jean Carrive, Ren\u00e9 Crevel and Georges Malkine, among others.Andr\u00e9 Breton, Manifestoes of Surrealism, transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor, 1971), p. 26. Yvan Goll published the Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme, 1 October 1924, in his first and only issue of Surr\u00e9alisme two weeks prior to the release of Breton's Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme, published by \u00c9ditions du Sagittaire, 15 October 1924. Goll and Breton clashed openly, at one point literally fighting, at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, over the rights to the term Surrealism. In the end, Breton won the battle through tactical and numerical superiority.Matthew S.

The document defines Surrealism as: The text includes numerous examples of the applications of Surrealism to poetry and literature, but makes it clear that its basic tenets can be applied to any circumstance of life; not merely restricted to the artistic realm. The importance of the dream as a reservoir of Surrealist inspiration is also highlighted. Breton also discusses his initial encounter with the surreal in a famous description of a hypnagogic state that he experienced in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind: \"There is a man cut in two by the window\". This phrase echoes Breton's apprehension of Surrealism as the juxtaposition of \"two distant realities\" united to create a new one. The manifesto also refers to the numerous precursors of Surrealism that embodied the Surrealist spirit, including the Marquis de Sade, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, Raymond Roussel, and Dante. The works of several of his contemporaries in developing the Surrealist style in poetry are also quoted, including Philippe Soupault, Paul \u00c9luard, Robert Desnos and Louis Aragon. The manifesto was written with a great deal of absurdist humor, demonstrating the influence of the Dada movement which preceded it. The text concludes by asserting that Surrealist activity follows no set plan or conventional pattern, and that Surrealists are ultimately nonconformists. The manifesto named the following, among others, as participants in the Surrealist movement: Louis Aragon, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Robert Desnos, Paul \u00c9luard, Jacques Baron, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Boiffard, Jean Carrive, Ren\u00e9 Crevel and Georges Malkine.'Andr\u00e9 Breton, Manifestoes of Surrealism, transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor, 1971), p. 26. ==Third manifesto== In 1929 Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and along with other theoretical refinements issued the Second manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme. The manifesto excommunicated Surrealists reluctant to commit to collective action: Baron, Desnos, Boiffard, Michel Leiris, Raymond Queneau, Jacques Pr\u00e9vert and Andr\u00e9 Masson. A pri\u00e8re d'ins\u00e9rer (printed insert) published with the Manifesto's release was signed by those Surrealists who remained loyal to Breton and who have decided to participate in a new publication titled Surrealism at the Service of the Revolution. Participants, and thus loyal Surrealists, included Maxime Alexander, Louis Aragon, Joe Bousquet, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Ren\u00e9 Char, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst, Marcel Fourrier, Camille Goemans, Paul Noug\u00e9, Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Francis Ponge, Marco Ristitch, Georges Sadoul, Yves Tanguy, Andr\u00e9 Thirion, Tristan Tzara and Albert Valentin.G\u00e9rard Durozoi, History of the Surrealist Movement, transl. Alison Anderson (Chicago, 2002), p. 193. Desnos and others thrown out by Breton moved to the periodical Documents, edited by Georges Bataille, whose anti-idealist materialism produced a hybrid Surrealism exposing the base instincts of humans.Dawn Ad\u00e8s, with Matthew Gale: \"Surrealism\", The Oxford Companion to Western Art.
