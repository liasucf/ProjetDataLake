    "text": "The 1974 Toronto municipal election was held on December 2, 1974 in Metropolitan Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Mayors, controllers, city councillors and school board trustees were elected in the municipalities of Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke and Scarborough. David Crombie was re-elected as Mayor of Toronto, and Mel Lastman was re-elected as Mayor of North York. ==Toronto== ===Mayoral race=== Incumbent David Crombie was extremely popular after his first term and faced no serious opposition in winning reelection. White supremacist Don Andrews placed second amongst the also-rans. As a result, the municipal law was changed so that the runner-up in the mayoralty contest no longer had the right to succeed to the mayor's chair should the position become vacant between elections. ;Results :David Crombie - 100,680 :Don Andrews - 5,662 :Joan Campana - 3,022 :Rosy Sunrise - 2,294 :William Harris - 2,262 :Glenn Julian - 2,423 :Richard Sangers - 1,454 :Ronald Rodgers :Rick Peletz - 1,024 :Arthur Seligman - 745 :Karl von Harten - 624 ===City council=== Ward boundaries used in the 1974 election Two aldermen were elected per ward. The alderman with the most votes was declared senior alderman and sat on both Toronto City Council and Metro Council. There were few major changes on city council. The reform faction remained the largest group on council, but did have a majority. The conservative \"old guard\" retained their seats as did the small Crombie-led group of moderates that made up the swing vote on council. Most incumbents were reelected with only a handful of exceptions. After failing to win the mayoralty in 1972 Tony O'Donohue returned to city council and successfully ousted New Democrat Archie Chisholm in Ward 2. In the downtown Ward 6 race anti-Spadina Expressway activist Allan Sparrow ousted long serving old guard member William Archer. The final executive, elected by city council, consisted of two right-of-centre moderates, Art Eggleton and David Smith, and two moderate reformers, Elizabeth Eayrs and Reid Scott. Crombie held the deciding vote between the right- and left-wing duos. ;Ward 1 (Swansea and Bloor West Village) :William Boytchuk (incumbent) - 6,158 :Elizabeth Eayrs (incumbent) - 3,038 :Ed Ziemba - 4,199 :Ben Grys - 3,174 :Wally Soia - 1,861 :Ceri Gluszczek - 1,275 :Ed Homonvio - 916 :Ib Amonsen - 764 :Joe Grabek - 481 :Yvette Tessier - 189 :Andries Murnieks - 157 ;Ward 2 (Parkdale and Brockton) :Tony O'Donohue - 6,375 :Ed Negridge (incumbent) - 4,968 :Archie Chisholm (incumbent) - 3,538 :Eleanor Bra - 1,192 :Anne Fritz - 941 :Jack Prins - 175 ;Ward 3 (Davenport and Corso Italia) :Michael Goldrick (incumbent) - 5,216 :Joseph Piccininni (incumbent) - 4,254 :Slough Bolton - 1,395 :Jerry Hill - 405 :George Zapparoli - 404 :Michael Hookway - 191 :Manuel Lumbreras - 119 ;Ward 4 (Trinity-Bellwoods and Little Italy) :Art Eggleton (incumbent) - 4,341 :George Ben (incumbent) - 2,708 :Joe Pantalone -1,759 :Frank Latka - 1,247 :Pat Case - 533 :Penny Simpson - 234 :Bob Smith - 200 ;Ward 5 (The Annex and Yorkville) :Colin Vaughan (incumbent) - 8,195 :Ying Hope (incumbent) - 7,173 :Erna Koffman - 1,737 :Manfred Schulzke - 1,643 :David Astle - 1,096 :Judy Lily Lucko - 371 :Lazlo Simo - 287 :Gary Weagle - 201 ;Ward 6 (Financial District, Toronto - University of Toronto) :Dan Heap (incumbent) - 6,607 :Allan Sparrow - 5,564 :William Archer (incumbent) - 4,311 :K Dock Yip - 2,507 :John Combs - 1,346 :Arthur Boyes - 368 :Fred Nelson - 294 ;Ward 7 (Regent Park and Riverdale) :John Sewell (incumbent) - 6,233 :Janet Howard - 4,248 :Gary Stamm - 3,813 :Andy Marinakis - 603 :Peggy Reinhardt - 454 :John Bizzell - 289 :Stanley Carrier - 388 :Kate Alderdice - 329 :Steve Necheff - 257 :Sandra Fox - 248 :Armand Siksna - 212 ;Ward 8 (Riverdale) :Thomas Clifford (incumbent) - 5,567 :Fred Beavis (incumbent) - 5,574 :Dallard Runge - 3,967 :Steve Martino - 796 :Larry Haiven - 496 :John Iannou - 398 :John Tsopelas - 361 :Alex Lauder - 338 :Beatrice Zaverrucha - 245 :Chris Greenland - 236 On January 28, 1975 a judicial recount gave Clifford a 7 vote majority over Beavis which gave him a seat on Metro Council. ;Ward 9 (The Beaches) :Reid Scott (incumbent) - 8,405 :Dorothy Thomas (incumbent) - 7,016 :Joe McNulty - 5,106 :Mary Trew - 417 :Brian Dunia - 412 ;Ward 10 (Rosedale and North Toronto) :William Kilbourn (incumbent) - 11,446 :John Bosley - 5,352 :Kevin Garland - 4,979 :Juanne Hemsol - 3,754 :Michael Grayson - 1,818 :Bruce Haines - 1,543 :Russell Puskluwez - 1,464 :Margaret Bryce - 953 :Horace Brown - 680 :John Kelly - 597 ;Ward 11 (Forest Hill and North Toronto) :David Smith (incumbent) - 11,933 :Anne Johnston (incumbent) - 10,804 :Pauline Shapero - 3,140 :Sydney Zaidi - 741 ==Vacancy== Ward 9 Alderman Reid Scott resigned upon appointment as provincial judge August 6, 1976.

He was re- elected for Area Two in 1980. In 1982, Toronto Separate School trustee Antonio Signoroni accused fellow trustee Joseph Marrese of being involved in a conflict-of-interest situation with Caruso. Marrese and Caruso were cousins and shared a business office, and Marrese had previously voted for contracts that went to Caruso's firm. Both Marrese and Caruso acknowledged the contracts, but denied any wrongdoing. Marrese argued that he had never shown preference to Caruso and questioned Signoroni's motives in raising the matter, noting that another of his relatives was challenging Signoroni in the 1982 campaign.John Spears, \"Catholic trustee shrugs off conflict-of-interest claim\", Toronto Star, 22 October 1982, A06. Caruso had previously managed Marrese' campaign as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1975 provincial election.

He later sought election 1976, but finished fourth against Jim Travers in Area Two.
