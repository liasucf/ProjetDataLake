These can include man- made or natural disasters. Emergency sanitation is also required during humanitarian relief operations for refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). \"Sanitation\" normally refers to the management of excreta, with \"Environmental sanitation\" also including stormwater management, solid waste disposal, vector control and air pollution.https://www.lboro.ac.uk/orgs/well/resources/Publications/guidance- manual/chapter-1.pdf Providing showers and handwashing facilities is also part of emergency sanitation during all phases. The immediate sanitation phase focuses on a providing proper waste management resources. The main course of action during this stage is reducing open defecation. It is implemented as a course of initial action in emergency situations and it lasts from one to three months. Toilets provided might include very basic latrines, pit latrines, bucket toilets, container-based toilets or chemical toilets. The short term sanitation phase provides technology to contain fecal matter for as long as six months. 75% of the affected population have access to such resources and 75% of the collected waste is disposed of properly. One waste bin that is around 100 liters is provided for the use of 100 people. Bins are placed at a maximum walking distance of 50 miles from congregated areas of people. Waste management bins installed during the long-term phase are sustainable to use for three years. During this phase, 95% of the population have access to the bins and 95% of the waste is properly of. Bins are placed at a maximum distance of 15 miles from living areas. Fecal sludge management becomes a priority during the long-term emergency management phase. == Background== Open defecation along the river bank in Burundi The term \"Emergency\" is perceived differently by different people and organisations. In a general sense, an emergency may be considered to be a phenomenon originating from a man-made and/or natural disaster which results in a serious, usually sudden threat to the health or well-being of the affected community which relies on external assistance to easily cope up with the situation. There are different categories of emergency depending on its time frame, whether it lasts for few weeks, several months or years. The number of people who are and will be affected by catastrophes (human crisis and natural disasters), which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, is rapidly increasing. The affected people are subjected to such dangers as temporary homelessness and risks to life and health.BORDA (2010). EmSan - Emergency Sanitation - An innovative & rapidly applicable solution to safeguard hygiene and health in emergency situations. Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (BORDA) & BORDA BNS Network Emergency sanitation is put into place to create suitable living conditions for populations who lack proper water resources and to decrease the spread of waterborne illnesses. In June of 2012, a conference was held with various relief agencies and government officials in order to address proper management of human fecal matter along with the public health of people struck with disaster. They concluded that the current solutions to improper sanitation were not up to date nor the best of quality. The decision to utilize technology to track human feces collection along with the creation of emergency sanitation coordination centers and the use of smart toilets were among a few of the implemented policies. == Standards == The Sphere (organization) standards have three standards relating to excreta management.,SPHERE Handbook (2018) 5. Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion namely * Excreta management standard 3.1: Environment free from human excreta. All excreta is safely contained on-site to avoid contamination of the natural, living, learning, working and communal environments * Excreta management standard 3.2: Access to and use of toilets. People have adequate, appropriate and acceptable toilets to allow rapid, safe and secure access at all times * Excreta management standard 3.3: Management and maintenance of excreta collection, transport, disposal and treatment. Excreta management facilities, infrastructure and systems are safely managed and maintained to ensure service provision and minimum impact on the surrounding environment. == Methods == Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in northern Uganda To address the problem of public health and the spread of dangerous diseases that come as a result of lack of sanitation and open defecation, humanitarian actors focus on the construction of, for example, pit latrines and the implementation of hygiene promotion programs.Grange, C. (2016). Faecal Sludge Management - WASH in Emergencies, Problem Exploration Report. HIF (Humanitarian Innovation Fund) Problem Exploration Report. Cardiff: ELRHA The supply of drinking water in an urban-setting emergency has been improved by the introduction of standardized, rapid deployment kits. Alternatively, germ-infected water can be sanitized by adding disinfectants, boiling and/or filtering. If the water supply contains toxic chemicals it cannot be made safe to drink. In the immediate emergency phase, the focus is on managing open defecation, and toilet technologies might include very basic trench latrines, pit latrines, bucket toilets, container- based toilets, chemical toilets. For short-term emergencies there should be an approximate of 1 latrine or toilet for every 50 people, and work should be done with the goal of eventually reducing this amount to 20 people per latrine/toilet if possible. The short term phase might also involve technologies such as urine-diverting dry toilets, septic tanks, decentralized wastewater systems. In urban emergencies, the main focus is usually on a quick rehabilitation and extension of existing services such as sewer-lines and waste-water treatment plants. This can also include the installation of sewerage pumping stations to improve or extend services. The creation of provisional hand washing stations or the distribution of hand sanitizer (that contains 60% of alcohol or more) are put into practice so that people keep their hands clean and thus eliminate the propagation of germs. Information on health care can be provided to the affected population in their respective languages, including instructions on how to use latrines efficiently. Further efforts can be made to help educate individuals who are not able to read the health communication materials. == Settings == The emergency response often has to differ greatly based on the setting it takes place. === Home-based === Home-based settings are settings where people choose to stay in or close to their homes (or those of their relatives, neighbours or friends). While this setting offers the quickest way to (self-) recovery, it also poses a high risk of sanitation-related consequences due to the common lack of access to outside help and inadequate public health monitoring. === Host community === Host community settings with significant displacement into outside communities (usually urban) with existing but maybe also effected sanitation infrastructure in private homes. Existing infrastructure in such settings is usually quickly overloaded due to the increase in population density and improvements/repair is often hindered by access- and space-limitations. Intra- community conflicts over the sanitation waste management are thus fairly common. === Mass shelter === Mass shelter settings where the displaced population is housed in existing but often re-purposed building-complexes such as schools, community centres, places of worship, malls, warehouses and sport stadiums. Jurisdictional governments are primarily responsible for ensuring that people are directed to clear evacuation routes and zones. In some disaster prone countries, dedicated large emergency shelters are built for this purpose.United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (2019) Planning Considerations: Evacuation and Shelter-in-Place Existing sanitation facilities are usually inadequate for full-time stay of a high number of people, and the non-emergency management structures are typically unable or unwilling to continue their services. Legal issues over the re-purposing are also fairly common, especially if occupation continues for a longer time. Due to usually cramped living conditions there is a high risk of conflict and often also cases of sexual violence, both of which often are in some relation to the sanitation facilities. Mortality rates are high among large groups of internally displaced people. === Emergency settlements === Emergency settlements (formal or informal) where previously sparsely populated areas are newly occupied by the displaced population in large numbers. Refugee camps fall into this category. Typically these are set up by governments, the UN and humanitarian aid organizations. Due to the typically short time frame of arrivals and the non-existing infrastructure, these kind of encampments pose maybe the greatest challenge in regards to providing adequate emergency sanitation facilities. The immediate demand for basic supplies and health services, having to account for the injured, dead, and survivors of man-made and/or natural disasters also aggravates these issues. == Challenges == Emergency pit lining kits, suitable for areas with high water table The provision of sanitation programmes is usually more challenging than water supply as it provides a limited choice of technologies. This is exacerbated by the overwhelming and diverse needs of WASH. Challenges with excreta disposal in emergencies include: * Building Latrines in areas where pits cannot be dug, desludging latrines, no-toilet options and the final treatment or disposal of the fecal sludge.Bastable, A., Russell, L. (2013). Gap Analysis in Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion. Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF), London, UK * Weak community participation and finding hygiene promotion designs that are suitable for a given context to make the WASH interventions sustainable. * Newly arriving IDP or refugee populations can usually only be settled in less than ideal areas, such as land that is prone to regular flooding or which is very dry and with rocky ground. This makes the provision of safe sanitation facilities and other infrastructure very difficult. *Women, children, the disabled, and other disadvantaged groups in the context of a sanitation crisis require specialized accommodations to fit their needs. * In long running emergencies, the safe decommissioning or desludging of previously quickly built sanitation facilities can also become a serious challenge. *In impoverished parts of the world, finding and allocating the funds and resources to implement technologies. * Humanitarian actors need to understand the importance of better preparation and resilience and the need for exit strategies and have consideration on the environment. == See also == * Self- supply of water and sanitation ==References== Category:Sanitation Category:Emergency management ",
