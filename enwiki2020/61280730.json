    "text": "Helen Marie Zout (b. 1957) is a photographer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002. Her work is in collections including Argentina's Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Leticia and Stanislas Poniatowski, and the HBC Global Art Collection. Zout's early work has a taste for the unusual -inherited from Diane Arbus- that is to be found in the work of the man who was her husband at the time, Ata\u00falfo Perez Aznar. Her most well known works relate to the disappearances carried out by the military dictatorship in Argentina between 1974 and 1983. == References == == External links == * Official site Category:Argentine photographers Category:Argentine women photographers Category:1957 births Category:Living people ",
