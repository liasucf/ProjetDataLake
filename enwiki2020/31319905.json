At 15 she began to play the guitar and wrote her first song, \"Can't Say Goodbye\". Her musical inspirations include Coldplay, The Beatles, Alexz Johnson, Paramore, and later Taylor Swift. == Music career == === 2006 === At the age of 14, Bonilla made her television debut in the Telemundo reality singing show competition, Quincea\u00f1era: Mam\u00e1 Quiero Ser Artista (Sweet Fifteen: Mom, I Want to be an Artist), which was produced and broadcast in 2006.
