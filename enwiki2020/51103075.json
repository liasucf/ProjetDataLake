Nastos stated \"Dynasty represents an interesting period in the artistic life of Getz, well out of pure bop, in between his commercial successes with Brazilian music, and on the verge of another phase of his life with fusion pioneers like Chick Corea. This is highly recommended, a solid effort from top to bottom\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Eddy Louiss except where noted. # \"Dum!
