Balmain were furious that the 1909 NSWRL grand final was to be played as the under card to the Wallabies v Kangaroos match. Balmain attempted to stop the match being played and refused to take the field. Storie and the other South Sydney players attended the ground and then ran on the field, kicked off and scored a try after which they were declared premiers. Storie retired from rugby league after the conclusion of this match.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.
