Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 9 June 2012 ==Taxonomic history== The decision to include Risbecia species within the genus Hypselodoris was made on the basis of a molecular (DNA) study which showed that Risbecia species are a clade inside the genus Hypselodoris as currently constituted.Johnson R.F. & Gosliner T.M. (2012) Traditional taxonomic groupings mask evolutionary history: A molecular phylogeny and new classification of the chromodorid nudibranchs. PLoS ONE 7(4): e33479. ==Distribution== This species was described from the Society Islands. It is reported to occur widely in the tropical Western Pacific Ocean from Australia to the Philippines.Rudman, W.B., 1999 (January 22) Risbecia tryoni (Garrett, 1873). [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney.Rudman W.B. (1984) The Chromodorididae (Opisthobranchia: Mollusca) of the Indo-West Pacific: a review of the genera.

Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 90: 305-407 page(s): 379 Hypselodoris tryoni ==Description== Hypselodoris tryoni has a brown body and white foot. The body and upper dorsum are covered in purple spots ringed with white or light-brown. The gills are typically translucent white or light-brown and the rhinophores are brown to dark-brown and covered in circular white lines. It has a thin blue or purple line on the mantle edge.Gosliner, T.M., Behrens, D.W. & Valdes, A. (2008) Indo-Pacific Nudibranchs and seaslugs. A field guide to the world's most diverse fauna. Sea Challengers Natural History Books, Washington, 426 pp. page(s): 270 There is some colour variation between individuals. Hypselodoris tryoni is similar in appearance to Goniobranchus geminus, Goniobranchus kuniei and Goniobranchus leopardus, although it lacks the wide purple mantle edge line present in those species. Goniobranchus species also tend to have a lower, more rounded body.Debelius, H. & Kuiter, R.H. (2007) Nudibranchs of the world. ConchBooks, Frankfurt, 360 pp. page(s): 140 Sea slugs such as Hypselodoris tryoni, are known to exhibit trailing behaviour where up to four animals will follow one another very closely, often touching. It is not known what causes this behaviour.Rudman, W.B., 2003 (March 5) Trailing behaviour. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. Hypselodoris tryoni reaches at least 60 mm in length and has been observed to raise and lower its head while crawling. Hypselodoris tryoni exhibiting \"trailing\" behaviour. ==Ecology== Like many slugs in the family Chromodorididae, Risbecia tryoni feeds on sponges and have been seen feeding on sponges from the genus Dysidea. When feeding they are sometimes accompanied by a species of shrimp, Periclimenes imperator, in an apparent form of commensalism.Swann, R., 2007 (May 16) Feeding Risbecia tryoni from Borneo.
