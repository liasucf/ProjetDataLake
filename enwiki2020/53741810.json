Her father was an English rancher and he oversaw a sheep farm. Her parents took her to visit England where her brother was born and her father died. Her mother Ida May (Cooke), who had been a Brisbane headteacher, decided to settle in the UK in Brighton. Yeoman suffered from tuberculosis of the spine throughout her childhood. She had to use her other hand after the disease took two of her fingers. Nevertheless, she trained at the Royal Academy and under artist and painter Stephen Spurrier.Beryl Yeoman, British Cartoon Archive, Retrieved 10 April 2017 Yeoman's first popular cartoons were as part of the partnership with her brother, Harold Underwood Thompson. Together they published under the name of \"Anton\" in the late 1930s. In time her brother found other interests directing an advertising company but Yeoman continued on alone.Mark Bryant, \u2018Yeoman, Antonia (1907\u20131970)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 April 2017 Yeoman worked regularly for The Tatler, Men Only, The New Yorker, London's Evening Standard, Private Eye, Lilliput, and Punch.
