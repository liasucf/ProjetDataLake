    "text": "Santiago V\u00e9scovi Vannet (born 14 September 2001) is a Uruguayan college basketball player for the Tennessee Volunteers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). ==Early life and career== Born in Montevideo, V\u00e9scovi grew up playing basketball at the youth level for Club Atl\u00e9tico Bohemios. In July 2017, his performance at a Basketball Without Borders camp in The Bahamas helped him earn an invitation to the NBA Academy Latin America in Mexico City. At age 16, he began attending the academy, while receiving online education through the Apex Learning Virtual School. In July 2019, V\u00e9scovi moved to the NBA Global Academy, a training center at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. That month, he led his team to the 2019 NBA Academy Games championship. V\u00e9scovi was named most valuable player of the 2019 Skill Factory Tournament of Champions after averaging 17.4 points per game. In September 2019, he averaged 12.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, three assists and 1.5 steals per game for the Uruguay Elite Team at the NBA G League International Challenge. ===Recruiting=== V\u00e9scovi was considered a four-star recruit by 247Sports and a three-star recruit by ESPN and Rivals. On 22 November 2019, he verbally committed to play college basketball for Tennessee. He planned on enrolling at the University of Tennessee during the second semester. ==College career== Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said in December 2019 that it was \"highly unlikely\" that V\u00e9scovi would play in his freshman season, indicating that he would likely redshirt to learn the system. However, with the loss of Lamonte Turner to injury, there was an opening for V\u00e9scovi to start at point guard. He was cleared to play for the team on 3 January 2020. One day later, he made his college debut, scoring 18 points, shooting 6-of-9 from three-point range, in a 78\u201364 loss to LSU. He also posted six rebounds and four assists, while committing nine turnovers. On 11 February, he recorded a freshman season-high 20 points and eight assists in an 82\u201361 win over Arkansas. In a game at Auburn on 22 February, an Auburn fan was ejected and barred from future games after yelling a xenophobic taunt at V\u00e9scovi. He started in all 19 of his appearances as a freshman, averaging 10.7 points, 3.7 assists, 3.3 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game. ==National team career== ===Uruguayan junior national team=== In October 2016, V\u00e9scovi averaged 21.8 points, six rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, leading Uruguay to fourth place at the FIBA South America Under-15 Championship in Asunci\u00f3n. ===Uruguayan senior national team=== V\u00e9scovi debuted for the Uruguayan senior national team at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima. ==Career statistics== ===College=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2019\u201320 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tennessee | 19 || 19 || 30.3 || .373 || .360 || .808 || 3.3 || 3.7 || 1.2 || .2 || 10.7 ==Personal life== V\u00e9scovi's father, Pablo, played volleyball for Club Atl\u00e9tico Bohemios.
