It is run at Leopardstown over a distance of 1 mile and 6 furlongs (2,816 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July. The race was first run in 1991 and was restricted to fillies and mares from 2016. Since 2016 the race has been run as the Stanerra Stakes. In 2018 it was upgraded from Listed to Group 3 status as part of changes to enhance the European programme of stayer's races. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font- size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 2000 | Pairumani Star | 5 | Pat Shanahan | John Dunlop | 3:0.60 |- | 2001 | Vinnie Roe | 3 | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 3:2.20 |- | 2002 | Queens Wharf | 4 | Jerry O'Dwyer | Michael Halford | 3:43.90 |- | 2003 | Blue Corrig | 3 | Declan McDonogh | Joseph Crowley | 3:00.70 |- | 2004 | Barolo | 5 | Johnny Murtagh | Peter Harris | 3:03.70 |- | 2005 | Orpington | 4 | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 2:56.20 |- | 2006 | Foreign Affairs | 8 | Declan McDonogh | Sir Mark Prescott | 2:57.60 |- | 2007 | Galistic | 4 | Danny Grant | Patrick J.
