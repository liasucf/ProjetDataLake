    "text": "Socialist Rebirth () was a minor social-democratic political party in Italy. The group was founded in 1993 from a split from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) led by Giorgio Benvenuto, who contested the continuing PSI lead by Ottaviano Del Turco which had lost a lot of electors. The RS and PSI were both members of the Alliance of Progressives coalition of centre-left parties formed to contest the 1994 general election. In 1995, RS merged into the Labour Federation, which itself merged into Democrats of the Left in 1998. ==References== Category:1993 establishments in Italy Category:1995 disestablishments in Italy Category:Defunct social democratic parties in Italy Category:Defunct political parties in Italy Category:Political parties disestablished in 1995 Category:Political parties established in 1993 Category:Italian political party stubs ",
