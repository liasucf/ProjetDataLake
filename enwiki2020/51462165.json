The buildings are inter-connected. The museum is subdivided into nineteen sections and there is an annually changing exhibition. All aspects of life and work on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee are shown in a well-ordered way. The museum collection dates back to the first century A.D. The visitor will find a complete dwelling, grocery shop and school classroom A.D. 1900. The sections fishery and agriculture give an impression of the principal means of living in the past. People may also take a glance at the workshops of a blacksmith, a cartwright, a clogmaker and a shoemaker. A photo-collection serves as a reminder of the \u2018Watersnoodramp\u2019, the disastrous flood of 1953, when hundreds of islanders were drowned. ==References== ==External links== * Official website in Dutch Category:Local museums in the Netherlands Category:Museums in South Holland ",
