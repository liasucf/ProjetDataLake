At the Salon of the Champ de Mars, she exhibited a portrait in pastel, in 1901; at exhibitions of the Society of American Artists in 1898 and 1899, she exhibited miniatures; also pictures in oils at Worcester, 1903. A collection of her writings are held by Duke University. These include unpublished stories, novels, poetry, and lecture notes, as well as diary excerpts. Her writings covered the timeless themes of love and religion, but also contemporary issues including automobiles, labor strikes, and women's rights. ==References== * Category:1848 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:American portrait painters Category:American women painters Category:Writers from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:Alumni of the Acad\u00e9mie Julian Category:Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi alumni Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th- century American women artists Category:19th-century American women artists Category:American expatriates in France ",
