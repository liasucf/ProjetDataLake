Most of the specimens he collected are marine algae, lichens, or bryophytes. ==Biography== Holmes was educated at the Grammar School in Boston, Lincolnshire and the Grammar School in Wimborne Minster. At age 14 he was apprenticed to a pharmacist in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London. From 1873 to 1876 he was a lecturer on botany at Westminster Hospital Medical School. From 1887 to 1890 he was a lecturer on materia medica at the Pharmaceutical Society. At the Pharmaceutical Society's Materia Medica Museum, 17 Bloomsbury Square, he was the curator from 1872 to 1922 and the emeritus curator from 1922 until his death in 1930. (In 1921 an automobile hit him, necessitating the amputation of part of one leg.) He published over 300 articles on drugs and medicinal plants. In 1882 he married Catherine \"Kate\" Appleford (b. 1842), who also collected British plants. In 1935 she donated his papers to the Wellcome Library. There were no children from the marriage. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:1843 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Fellows of the Linnean Society of London Category:English curators Category:19th-century British botanists Category:20th-century British botanists Category:British phycologists ",
