    "text": "Tonna Rugby Football Club is a rugby union team from the village of Tonna, Wales, UK. Tonna RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Ospreys. ==History== Although it is believed that Tonna RFC was in existence before 1888, the first officially recorded report came from the 1887/88 season when the Cambria Daily Reader stated that Tonna RFC were drawn to play Mynyddbach in the local Neath cup challenge cup. It is therefore recorded that Tonna RFC came into being on the 28 February 1888. Tonna RFC's first international player was David Harris Davies, although playing for Neath RFC at the time of his one and only cap against Scotland in 1904, he came through the playing ranks of Tonna. With the outbreak of the First World War the club disbanded, but reformed as Dulais United after the war. This team was an amalgamation of local villages Tonna, Aberdulais, Cadoxton, Cilfrew and Cefn-yr-allt; but the team was still housed in Tonna. ==Notable players== Full Senior Internationals * David Harris Davies - Neath RFC (1 cap)Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp464 * Arthur Lemon - Neath RFC (13 caps) * Martyn Davies - Neath RFC (1 Cap) * Alan Edmunds- Aberavon RFC,Neath RFC (2 caps) * Craig Mitchell Neath RFC,Ospreys,Exeter Chiefs,Cardiff Blues,Newport Gwent Dragons,Bath (15 caps) * Leigh Davies Neath RFC,Cardiff RFC,Bristol RFC,Ospreys,Llanelli Scarlets (Captain) - 21 Caps * * Doug Phillips (rugby) Douglas V Phillips Rugby League International Oldham RLFC, Broughton Park Rangers RLFC Belle Vue RLFC. 9 Wales RL Caps & 4 Great Britain Caps (including 1950 Series win in Australia) * * Barbarians RFC Martyn Davies (Neath RFC), Chris Gittins (Aberavon RFC) ==References== ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20130206182838/http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/tonnarfc Category:Welsh rugby union teams Category:1888 establishments in Wales Category:Rugby clubs established in 1888 Category:Rugby union in Neath Port Talbot ",
