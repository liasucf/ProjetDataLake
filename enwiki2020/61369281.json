    "text": "Shaped by Fire is the seventh studio album by American metalcore band As I Lay Dying. It was released on September 20, 2019, through Nuclear Blast. The album was produced by the band themselves and is the follow-up to the group's sixth album, Awakened (2012). It is also the first album in seven years after the band went on hiatus in 2014 when Tim Lambesis was incarcerated and sentenced to six years in prison for soliciting the murder of his estranged wife. ==Background and promotion== After Lambesis was released from prison on probation in December 2016, he began reaching out to the other members of the band looking to apologize in person starting with Mancino and Gilbert. After that he attempted to reconnect with Sgrosso and Hipa and eventually all four of them forgave him. On June 8, 2018, the band released the music video for \"My Own Grave\". On April 12, 2019, the band released a music video for \"Redefined\", including a guest appearance by August Burns Red frontman Jake Luhrs. Two days later, the band announced the \"Shaped by Fire\" tour of Europe with support from Chelsea Grin, Unearth and Fit for a King running from September 2019 and concluding in October. On July 15, the band announced the North American dates of the \"Shaped by Fire\" Tour with direct support from After the Burial and Emmure to begin on November 15 at the House of Blues in Las Vegas and conclude on December 14 with a hometown show at the Soma San Diego. Details of the album, Shaped by Fire, were leaked through Nuclear Blast's European website with a projected release date. On August 9, the band officially announced their album, Shaped by Fire, would be released through Nuclear Blast Records, along with releasing the album's title track. On September 13, the band released \"Blinded\" as the album's fourth single along with an accompanying music video. In March 2020, as a way of supporting their crew during the COVID-19 pandemic, they released an additional song, \"Destruction or Strength\", a B-side from this album's sessions. Two months later, in May, a music video for the song \"Torn Between\" was released. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits retrieved from AllMusic.
