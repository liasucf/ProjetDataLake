At the University of Manchester, Breuilly still regarded himself primarily as a historian of Germany when he became interested in nationalisms. He realised that the only way the book he was looking for on the subject would exist, was if he wrote it. His pioneering Nationalism and the State was published in 1982. Breuilly was also the editor of the Oxford handbook of the history of nationalism (2013). ==Selected publications== *Nationalism and the State.
