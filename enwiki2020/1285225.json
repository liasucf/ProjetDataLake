    "text": "The Jeker (Dutch: Jeker, French: Geer) is a river in Belgium and in the Netherlands. It is a left-bank tributary to the river Meuse. The source of the Jeker is near the village of Geer, in the Belgian province of Li\u00e8ge. The river is approximately long, of which about is in Belgium (provinces of Li\u00e8ge and Limburg) and in the Netherlands (province of Limburg), where it flows into the river Meuse at Maastricht (Netherlands). Places through which the Jeker passes include Waremme, Tongeren, Kanne, (all three in Belgium) and Maastricht. ==Recreational aspect== Rafting on the Jeker is an entertaining recreational activity. Beginning in Kanne, it is possible to raft into the city of Maastricht on this relaxing river. The water flow is best in mid-autumn and spring. Obstacles may be present when the water is low. The trip from Kanne to Maastricht takes about two hours and crosses the border between Belgium and the Netherlands. ==Gallery== File:Hollogne-sur-Geer Jeker.jpg|Jeker river at Hollogne-sur-Geer (Belgium) File:Conservatorium.JPG|Jeker river passing buildings of Music Conservatorium at Maastricht File:Stadspark seen from city wall.JPG|Jeker river passing through Maastricht citypark File:Jeker4.JPG|Jeker river's estuary in Meuse river Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of the Netherlands Category:Rivers of Li\u00e8ge (province) Category:Rivers of Limburg (Belgium) Category:Rivers of South Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Geography of Maastricht Category:Tongeren ",
