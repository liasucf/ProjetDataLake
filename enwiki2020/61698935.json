    "text": "Stensholmen is a small island (or skerry) lying off the west coast of Sweden, in the locality of Fj\u00e4llbacka, and is part of the islands of Bohusl\u00e4n. It is the last resting place of a number of British and German sailors killed in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War and subsequently washed up on and around the island, including the author Gorch Fock (real name Johann Wilhelm Kinau). The war-grave on Stensholmen was established in 1920 and currently is the resting ground of 12 German sailors. The graveyard is managed by the German Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge organisation. Stensholmen is only accessible by boat from the port of Fj\u00e4llbacka, which it is situated a few kilometres away from. The journey takes roughly 20 minutes. Stensholmen neighbours the island of Kalv\u00f6, which is inhabited by three people. == See also == * List of islands of Sweden ==References== Category:Islands of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County ",
