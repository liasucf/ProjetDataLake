    "text": "Mead in 2019 Sir \"Sidney\" Hirini Moko Haerewa Mead (born 8 January 1927) is a New Zealand anthropologist, historian, artist, teacher, writer and prominent M\u0101ori leader. Initially training as a teacher and artist, Mead taught in many schools in the East Coast and Bay of Plenty regions, and later served as principal of several schools. After earning his PhD in 1968, he taught anthropology in several universities abroad. He returned to New Zealand in 1977 and established the first M\u0101ori studies department in the country. Mead later became a prominent M\u0101ori advocate and leader, acting in negotiations on behalf of several tribes and sitting on numerous advisory boards. He has also written extensively on M\u0101ori culture. He is currently the chair of the council of Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Awanui\u0101rangi.http://www.wananga.ac.nz/about/council/the- council ==Early life== Sidney Moko Mead was born in Wairoa, Hawke's Bay on 8 January 1927, the son of Sidney Montague Mead, a P\u0101keh\u0101 from Wairoa, and Paranihia \"Elsie\" Moko, a M\u0101ori from Te Teko in the Bay of Plenty. He is of Ng\u0101ti Awa, Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa, Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe and T\u016bhourangi descent. Sidney had an older brother who died as a young child. His parents also separated while Sidney was young, and he subsequently moved with his mother to her hometown of Te Teko. Hirini is the eldest of eight children of Paranihia Moko. Te Wharekaihua Coates, Waimarama Brown, Mihaere Maurice Emery, Paretoroa Waikato, Taea Emery, Elsie Morrison and Gavin Hirikanawa (wh\u0101ngai). Growing up during the Great Depression, much of his early childhood was spent in the care of his grandmother while his mother lived elsewhere working. He attended Te Teko Native School until age nine, at which age he was taken in by a foster family in Murupara. There he was enrolled in the Rangitahi Native School. One of his teachers at the Murupara school was Bruce Biggs, who later became a prominent M\u0101ori academic and mentor to a generation of other M\u0101ori scholars. During his high school years he received a scholarship to St Stephens Anglican College in Auckland, before transferring to Te Aute College, a prominent M\u0101ori school in Hawke's Bay. ==Teaching career== In 1944, Mead attended teaching college in Auckland, specialising in M\u0101ori education and art. He began teaching in M\u0101ori schools in the East Cape region, starting off at Manutahi District High School in Ruatoria and working as an itinerant teacher in many schools across the East Coast. During this time he also married June Te Rina Walker, of Ng\u0101ti Porou. Mead later taught in schools in the neighbouring Bay of Plenty region, including in the Urewera Valley, Whakatane, Tauranga and Te Kaha. Mead became a headmaster of several schools in the region. His first appointment as headmaster was at Minginui M\u0101ori School in the Urewera Valley, where he remained in the position for eight years. He later took up headmaster positions at Waim\u0101rama M\u0101ori School and Whatawhata School. Formalising his academic qualifications, Mead earned a Diploma in teaching in 1962, followed by Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees at the University of Auckland, which were both completed by 1965. Mead earned his PhD at the University of Southern Illinois in 1968, with his former teacher Bruce Biggs acting as one of his supervisors. ==Academic career== Mead taught abroad during the early 1970s, including at McMaster University and the University of British Columbia in Canada. After finishing a stint as associate professor at McMaster University's anthropology department, he returned to New Zealand and became the first Professor of M\u0101ori at the Victoria University of Wellington. After his arrival in 1977, he restructured the M\u0101ori Studies department at the university, developing it into the first stand-alone M\u0101ori Studies department in the country, starting in 1981. In the early 1980s, Professor Mead was largely responsible for the establishment of Te Herenga Waka Marae, the first university-based marae at a mainstream campus.Victoria University of Wellington: School of M\u0101ori Studies \u2013 About Us. Retrieved 21 January 2011. He was also a co-curator of Te M\u0101ori, an exhibition of M\u0101ori art and cultural treasures from museum collections that toured the United States during the mid-1980s. Professor Mead retired from the Victoria University of Wellington in 1990 after 14 years at the head of New Zealand's first M\u0101ori studies department. ==M\u0101ori leader== From the 1970s onwards, Mead became more involved in tribal affairs, particularly those of Ng\u0101ti Awa. He helped to establish the Ng\u0101ti Awa Trust Board in 1980, the first representative body for the tribe in the 20th century. For almost 20 years the Trust Board helped to research and prepare Ng\u0101ti Awa's case for historical redress with the Waitangi Tribunal. This led to the publication of the Ng\u0101ti Awa Raupatu Report in 1999, which outlined Ng\u0101ti Awa's historical grievances dating back to the New Zealand Wars and subsequent land confiscations. Mead acted as chief negotiator for the tribe during settlement negotiations with the Crown. Five years from the publication of the raupatu report, a settlement between Ng\u0101ti Awa and the Crown was reached in 2003 and enacted by the government in 2005. Professor Mead also became the inaugural chair of the new Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101ti Awa, which replaced the Ng\u0101ti Awa Trust Board as the administrative body for the iwi. In 1992 he helped to establish Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Awanui\u0101rangi based in Whakatane, which in 1997 became only the third w\u0101nanga in the country recognised under the Education Act 1989. He was also appointed to Waitangi Tribunal in 2003, and has served on numerous advisory boards, including the New Zealand Bioethics council, the New Zealand Council for Educational Research, Toi M\u0101ori and Te M\u0101ori Manaaki Taonga Trust. Five years after successfully concluding Ng\u0101ti Awa's settlement with the Crown, Mead was chosen as the inaugural chair of the Institute for Post Treaty Settlement Futures, an initiative of Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Awanui\u0101rangi with support from Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101ti Awa, which aims to provide strategies to help iwi with settlement negotiations with the Crown as well as managing settlement assets. Mead was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal in 2003. He has been a panel member for a number of Waitangi Tribunal inquiries, including the National Park district inquiry and the Te Rohe Potae district inquiry. In the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours, Mead was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to M\u0101ori and education. In the 2009 Special Honours, following the reintroduction of titular honours by the government, Mead accepted redesignation as a Knight Companion of The New Zealand Order of Merit.Special Honours List (12 August 2009) 118 New Zealand Gazette 2691 His wife June, Lady Mead, died on 27 March 2019.
