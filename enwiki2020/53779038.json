Across two series, a total of twelve episodes were broadcast. Episodes were broadcast at 9:00pm on Fridays as part of LWT's new-look slate of British drama.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgzgtnYWNV8 For the second series, a number of new regular cast members were introduced, including Ian Fitzgibbon, Susan McArdle and Rupert Procter. In 1996, a docudrama series with the same name aired on Channel 4, following the lives of six people from different countries around the world infected by the HIV virus. Subsequently, there was some confusion as several TV listings magazines confused the two programmes in the listings guide. Notably, the series has never been released on VHS or DVD. ==Cast== * Jessica Hynes as Alice Timpson * Amanda Royle as Dr. Sue McPherson * Susannah Wise as Dr. Michaela Lennox * Paul Higgins as Alan McPherson * Sophie Okonedo as Kelly Booth * Jenny Bolt as Cassandra Naylor * Sean Blowers as Sgt.
