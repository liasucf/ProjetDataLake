Sailing by way of Manila, she lifted Chinese troops from Hong Kong to Taku and Tsingtao in two voyages from 24 October to 21 November. ===Operation Magic Carpet=== Cullman then joined Operation Magic Carpet, the giant operation tasked with bringing returning servicemen home to the United States for discharge. She embarked homeward-bound servicemen at Manila for San Francisco, arriving 16 December 1945. She made a second voyage to Okinawa between 10 January and 15 February 1946. ===Decommission=== Cullman then returned to San Francisco where she was decommissioned on 22 May 1946 and transferred to the War Shipping Administration 30 June 1946 for disposal.
