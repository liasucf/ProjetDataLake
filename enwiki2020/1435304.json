Kamome Island in the town is part of Hiyama Prefectural Natural Park. ==Climate== Esashi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) with far less snow in winter than elsewhere in Hokkaido due to the influence of the warming tsushima-kairyu ocean current. ==Culture== The area is home to Esashi Oiwake, a traditional Japanese folk music derived from mago-uta verses from Shinshu which spread throughout Japan during the Edo era and have become an Esashi art form.Japan Foundation Information Centre , loaded 15 May 2007 The district holds a national oiwake convention each September.
