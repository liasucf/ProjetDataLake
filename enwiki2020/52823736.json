Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 ==Reception== In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow notes \"Kenny Barron could easily go unidentified if some of the selections on this LP were played for a listener during a \"blindfold test\" \u2013 he sounds quite unrecognizable on the three numbers on which he plays electric piano. Barron, who is joined by electric bassist Bob Cranshaw, drummer Freddie Waits, and the colorful percussion of both Richard Landrum and Warren Smith on his five originals and one by Waits, utilizes electricity with intelligence and creativity. His songs are moody and complex yet somewhat accessible and this underrated set would certainly surprise some of his current fans\" In JazzTimes David Zych wrote \"The program has Barron offering a rich program of originals with a '70s tinge, but nevertheless rich, imaginative, and worth repeated listenings\".Zych, D., JazzTimes Review, accessed January 9, 2017 == Track listing == All compositions by Kenny Barron except where noted. # \"Sunset\" \u2013 9:08 # \"A Flower\" \u2013 6:56 # \"Swamp Demon\" \u2013 4:43 # \"Al-Kifha\" (Freddie Waits) \u2013 6:17 # \"Delores Street, S.F.\" \u2013 6:43 # \"Dawn\" \u2013 6:03 == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano, electric piano *Bob Cranshaw \u2013 electric bass *Freddie Waits \u2013 drums *Richard Landrum \u2013 congas, percussion *Warren Smith \u2013 vibraphone, percussion == References == Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1973 albums Category:Muse Records albums Category:Albums produced by Don Schlitten ",
