Crink (Devine), the eldest boy, finds little waif Lettie (Battista), who joins the family. Through Penzie's care the girl improves. Also in the neighborhood are the mysterious couple Frank (Sedley) and Gussie Bosley (Bonillas) who are counterfeiters. During a boat excursion sponsored by Alderman Curry (Hendricks), Frank is discovered passing off his false notes and Gussie gives Penzie a large bill to buy refreshments for the children but to return the change to her. Frank tries to destroy the evidence and burns the remaining bills in his pockets. Through his carelessness, the boat catches fire, forcing all on board to flee. Later, as the law enforcement net begins to close on them, the Bosleys prepare to leave but are apprehended by Secret Service men. Penzie, who has been falsely accused of passing false money, is exonerated. ==Cast== *Mary Carr as Mrs. Penfield *Myrta Bonillas as Gussie Bosley *Miriam Battista as Lettie *Jerry Devine as Crink *Ernest McKay as Thad *Peggy Shaw as Lorene Percy *Lisle Leigh as Mrs. Percy *Fred Esmelton as Jeremiah Winston *Henry Sedley as Frank Bosley *Louis Hendricks as Alderman Curry *Edward Boring as Mr. Wopple *Emily Lorraine as Perennial Prue *Ben Lyon as Dick Chase *Richard Collins as Counterfeiter *Nick Hollen as Detective ==Preservation== With no copies located in film archives, The Custard Cup is a lost film.Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Database: The Custard Cup ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1923 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American drama films Category:1923 drama films Category:Fox Film films Category:Films directed by Herbert Brenon Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films ",
