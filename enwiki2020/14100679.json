    "text": "Tulimyrsky (Firestorm) is the first EP of the Finnish folk metal band Moonsorrow. Initially scheduled for release on March 26, 2008 through Spinefarm Records, the release date was postponed until April 30 to allow for proper promotion. Over an hour in length, the release contains one new song, two covers and two re-recorded tracks from the band's early demos. It was stated that this release is categorized as an EP so that it will not be interpreted as the band's new album. The title track is divided into nine \"chapters\" in the lyric sheet, which do not always correspond with the sequence of progression between musical themes. The music deviates from chapter to chapter, from brutal black metal to acoustic folk rhythms. The remake of \"Taistelu Pohjolasta\" does not incorporate the opening section of the original piece (which appeared on T\u00e4m\u00e4 ikuinen talvi); thus, the only movements incorporated are \"Punaisen lumen valtakunta\" and \"J\u00e4isten j\u00e4rvien kimalteessa.\" The remake of \"Hvergelmir,\" however, does include the coda \"Elivagar (Pakanavedet),\" accompanied by a spoken monologue in Swedish that does not appear in the original. ==Track listing== Tracks #3 and #4 originally appeared on T\u00e4m\u00e4 ikuinen talvi and Mets\u00e4 respectively. ==References== Category:2008 EPs Category:Moonsorrow albums ",
