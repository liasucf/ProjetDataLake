The airline operates Boeing 787-9 aircraft on scheduled services between Europe and the Americas from its base at Gatwick Airport. ==History== In November 2015, the British civil aviation authorities issued Norwegian Air UK its air operator's certificate. The following month, the airline applied to the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for an exemption and a permit to begin flights to the country. In June 2016 however, the USDOT denied Norwegian Air UK's request for an exemption, which would have allowed the airline to start flights to the United States while its foreign air-carrier permit (FACP) remained under review. Meanwhile, the department placed the airline's application for a FACP on hold. The USDOT stated that it needed more time to review issues raised by various labour unions, such as the claim that Norwegian Air UK would violate labour laws by employing flight crew based in East Asia. In July 2017, the USDOT approved Norwegian Air UK's application for its foreign air-carrier permit, citing the airline's commitments to hire crew based in the United States and the EU. The airline's first services under its own air operator's certificate and IATA/ICAO codes (DI and NRS) were from Oslo Gardermoen to Barcelona, M\u00e1laga and Nice in September 2017, prior to its regularly scheduled services from London Gatwick to Singapore later that month and from London Gatwick to Buenos Aires Ezeiza in February 2018. From 25 March 2018, the airline began operating the rest of the Norwegian group's long haul routes from London Gatwick to the United States, which were previously operated by Norwegian Long Haul on behalf of parent company Norwegian Air Shuttle. ==Destinations== As of October 2020, Norwegian Air UK serves the following destinations of which some are still suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic:norwegian.com - Route map retrieved 17 October 2020 {| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" !Country !City !Airport !Notes !Refs |- |Argentina||Buenos Aires||Ministro Pistarini International Airport|| || |- |Brazil||Rio de Janeiro||Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o International Airport|| || align=\"center\" | |- |Singapore||Singapore||Singapore Changi Airport|| || align=\"center\" | |- |United Kingdom||London||Gatwick Airport|| || |- | rowspan=\"14\" |United States |Austin||Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|| || |- |Boston||Logan International Airport|| || |- |Chicago||O'Hare International Airport|||| align=\"center\" | |- |Denver||Denver International Airport|||| align=\"center\" | |- |Fort Lauderdale||Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|| || align=\"center\" | |- |Las Vegas||McCarran International Airport|| || align=\"center\" | |- |Los Angeles||Los Angeles International Airport|| || |- |Miami||Miami International Airport|| || align=\"center\" | |- |New York City||John F.
