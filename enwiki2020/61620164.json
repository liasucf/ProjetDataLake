For decades it was used as a warehouse by the State University of Tartu and later the National Museum of Ethnography of the Estonian SSR. The church was returned to the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church in 1995. The church was re-consecrated in the summer of 2003 by the parish priests Vadim Rebane and deacon Timothy Vasel.https://www.visitestonia.com/en/tartu-st-alexanders-church-of-the- estonian-apostolic-orthodox-church Tartu St Alexander\u2019s Church of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church], Visit Estonia, retrieved 27 August 2019 ==Gallery== File:Tartu P\u00fcha Aleksandri kirik.JPG|The Russian style domes File:Karlova, S\u00f5bra t\u00e4nav 19A, St. Alexander's Church.JPG|The church in 2016 File:Tartu P\u00fchade Aleksandrite Kirik.JPG|The church in 2013 ==References== Category:20th-century churches Category:Eastern Orthodox churches in Estonia Category:Buildings and structures in Tartu Category:Churches in Tartu ",
