    "text": "John Franklin Ryan (November 9, 1848 \u2013 November 30, 1936) was a Virginia politician. He represented Loudoun County in the Virginia House of Delegates, and served as that body's Speaker from 1894 until 1899, and again from 1901 until 1906. Ryan was identified as possibly having been involved in Virginia's Jim Crow-era segregation laws during the naming process for an elementary school in Loudoun County; the school in question was ultimately named Waxpool Elementary School instead. ==References== *List of former Speakers of the House of Delegates, in the old House chamber in the Virginia State Capitol ==External links== * * Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:Speakers of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:People from Loudoun County, Virginia Category:1848 births Category:1936 deaths ",
