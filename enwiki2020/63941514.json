Newsweek magazine reported that officials who insisted on anonymity had confirmed that Frerichs had been taken captive by the Haqqani network, a group closely aligned with the Taliban. Frerichs is a director of International Logistical Support whose work had led him to visit Afghanistan multiple times since 2012. He is a veteran of the US Navy. The Associated Press reported that US intelligence officials tracked Frerichs's cell-phone, and raided a village near where he disappeared, approximately a week after his disappearance in Khost Province. Although they rounded up individuals from that village, the raid proved unproductive. Frerichs's sister, Charlene Cakora, has questioned why the US government \"signed a peace deal\" with the Taliban in early February that did not include provision for releasing her brother. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, lead agency of the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, issued a statement saying the cell was working to ensure \u201cthat Mark Frerichs and all Americans held hostage abroad are returned home.\u201d On May 10, 2020, the FBI offered a $1 million reward for information that helps lead to Frerichs's release or rescue. On May 10, 2020, Taliban spokesmen asserted they have conducted an inquiry of their subordinate and associated groups, to confirm they are not holding Frerichs. ==References== Category:1962 births ",
