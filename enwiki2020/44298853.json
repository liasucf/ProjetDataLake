The inscriptions were discovered around 1930s and first studied by Dr K P Jayaswal. who tentatively dates it 1500 BC. There are two theories regarding the inscription \u2013 one declares it a writing, while others doubt it as a rock art and nonliterate rock carvings ===Theory of literate script=== According to Jayaswal, the prehistoric scribblings at Vikramkhol represent a picto syllabic writing system which represents a mixture of Harappan and Brahmi hence forming a connection between the two. The inscribed portion covers an area of 35 feet by 7 feet, The evidences which support it as a writing system are as follows; * The characters are carefully painted and then inscribed which has parallels with brahmi rock inscriptions * The writings are in regular lines (not always regular due to rough rock surface) * the symbols have set forms which disclose \u2018writing habits in the phraseology of handwriting experts. The hand which first painted the letters was used to writing with a pen as evidenced from a certain portion of the inscription. * The system knows the bindu, and also, probably, the visarga. Some letters have dots placed below them, while in some cases dots seem to give a discriminative value to the letters, as in Semitic writing. * The right-hand corner top line on Plate 8, where the same symbol is repeated more than once, may point to the employment of numerals. * It is evident that some of the letters disclose accentuation. Repetition of the same letter twice probably suggests consonantal duplication or conjuncts. * The writing seems to have reached the syllabary (alphabetic) stage. Other scholars such as Naresh Prasad Rastogi state that Its date of the Vikramkhol inscription is still debatable and its letters deserve a more searching scrutiny ===Non literate system=== Scholars such as Richard Salomon have completely dismissed the Vikramkhol cave inscriptions as pseudo inscriptions According C.L Fabri, the topsy turvy incised signs may have some resemblance with Brahmi script but may not represent writing but possibility of a primitive rural writing cannot be denied either ===Neglect=== Some historians have felt that, due to negligence and apathy by Government agencies, the inscriptions are fading out and damaged by vandals. Activities of coal mines in surrounding hills, industries like sponge iron are putting environmental pressure on this prehistoric archeological site. The rock shelter, where the inscriptions are found, is not fully protected and kept open to atmosphere, giving scope for vandals and visitors to deface the inscriptions. As it is located inside Reserve Forest of Belpahar range, the remote access to the place has also contributed to neglect by Government Agencies. === other inscriptions === Another set of proto Brahmi or pre historic inscriptions have been found at Garjan Dongar in Sundergarh district, and Ushakothi in Sambalpur district in Orissa. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Odisha Category:Prehistoric art Category:Rock art in India Category:Caves containing pictograms in India Category:Rock shelters Category:Jharsuguda district Category:Caves of Odisha ",
