It is an affiliate station of The Edge Radio network. The station's studio and transmitter is located at Candelaria, Quezon. ==History== ===Killerbee=== The station was launched in 1991 as Killerbee 103.1 Lucena, owned and operated by Advanced Media Broadcasting System (an affiliated/sister company of Quest Broadcasting Inc., which owns the Killerbee brand), airing Top 40/CHR music. Among its DJs were Dennis D' Menace, Captain Hook, The Rainman, The Monster, DJ Mike, T-Rex, DJ Tom, Acela Banana, Cookie and Willy K. The station was closed in 2003. ===The Edge Radio=== The Edge Radio began airing in 2003 at 90.3 MHz (DWMZ) in Lucena, when the UCB formed a partnership with Century Broadcasting Network. The station lasted around in the early 2010s when The Edge Radio decided to transferred its frequency to 103.1 MHz and relocated its broadcast transmission from Lucena to Candelaria, Quezon, as Century reformatted 90.3 as Contemporary MOR station Magik FM. With this transfer, the station under the new frequency rebranded itself as \"The Edge Radio Strong South\", maintaining its signal reaching the entire Quezon and its neighbored provinces. In May 2013, one of the station's presenters and a blocktimer, Melinda Jennifer Glefonea, was reportedly abducted by 2 unidentified men at a restaurant in the town's proper. However, Quezon police authorities found out that her abduction/kidnapping was actually a set-up by Glefonea herself as she told to the police. DZKX, as well as 3 other Century-owned Edge Radio stations, were later sold to and spun-off into Christian Music Power (CMPI), a broadcast franchisee of UCB in the Philippines. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Quezon Category:Christian radio stations in the Philippines Category:Radio stations established in 1991 ",
