It can be constructed by dual of compound of four octahedra. Its surface area is 687/77 square lengths of the edge.http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cube4-Compound.html == Cartesian coordinates == With added fifth cube Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of this compound are: : (\u00b13, \u00b13, \u00b13) : (\u00b15, \u00b11, \u00b11) : (\u00b11, \u00b15, \u00b11) : (\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b15) ==See also== *Compound of three octahedra *Compound of five octahedra *Compound of ten octahedra *Compound of twenty octahedra *Compound of six cubes == References == Category:Polyhedral compounds ",
