Ully was selected by the Dallas Stars in the fifth round (131st overall) of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Ully first played in the Alberta Midget Hockey League with the Calgary Jr. Flames. He was drafted 30th overall in the 2010 WHL Bantom Draft by the Kamloops Blazers. Following his selection in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, and in the midst of his fourth full season with the Blazers, Ully was signed to a three-year, entry- level contract with the Dallas Stars on December 19, 2014. During the 2014\u201315 WHL season while playing with the Kamloops Blazers, Ully scored 34 goals and 60 assists, and was named to the WHL Western Conference First All-Star Team. Ully played the duration of his entry-level contract within the Dallas Stars minor league affiliate's, the Texas Stars and Idaho Steelheads. As an impending restricted free agent from the Stars following the 2017\u201318 season, Ully was not tendered a qualifying offer and was released to free agency. On August 2, 2018, Ully agreed to a one-year AHL contract with the Colorado Eagles, affiliate to the Colorado Avalanche. After attending the Eagles inaugural AHL training camp, Ully was re-assigned to begin the 2018\u201319 season in the ECHL, with affiliate the Utah Grizzlies, on September 30, 2018. Ully made 38 appearances with the Grizzlies, posting 41 points, while suiting up in two contests with the Eagles during the season.
