It was renamed Kasumigaseki on 14 January 1930 following the opening of the nearby Kasumigaseki Country Club in 1929. Later, in 1940, the former name was reassigned to Matoba Station on the Kawagoe Line. A track operated by Saitama Prefecture formerly led from this station to a gravel excavation site on the nearby Iruma River, but this was closed in 1957. The platform was previously linked to the station building on the south side by an underground passage, but in 2007, the station was rebuilt with the station facilities relocated above the platforms. In 2008, an entrance was also added on the north side of the station. From 17 March 2012, station numbering was introduced on the Tobu Tojo Line, with Kasumigaseki Station becoming \"TJ-23\". ==Passenger statistics== In fiscal 2015, the station was used by an average of 29,448 passengers daily.
