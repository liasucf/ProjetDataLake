    "text": "A Brief History of Time is a 1991 biographical documentary film about the physicist Stephen Hawking, directed by Errol Morris. The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but whereas the book is an explanation of cosmology, the film is a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with family members, colleagues, and even his childhood nanny. The music is by frequent Morris collaborator, Philip Glass. The film project originated with executive producer Gordon Freedman who brought the project to Anglia Television as a co-producer. After acquiring the property, Freedman met with director Steven Spielberg for advice on how to make the project into an important documentary film. Spielberg suggested Errol Morris as director. Freedman's production company partnered with Anglia Television and Tokyo Broadcasting. David Hickman, of Anglia, became the film's producer. ==Production== Due to the fact that Errol Morris adapts the documentary A Brief History of Time from Stephen Hawking's book A Brief History of Time: From The Big Bang to Blackholes, much of Morris's directing and editing work was dedicated to formating the fixed theoretical science about the origins of the universe alongside that of his subject, Hawking, who had quite the aversion to featuring his personal life in the film. In addition, Morris only had a few days of access to film and interview Stephen Hawking. Because of Hawking's ALS, a disease that progressively affects nerve cells within the spine and brain, Morris had to navigate around and with the tools, Hawking used to communicate, such as his computer-based communication system, which included a voicebox. Hawking's battery-powered system, sponsored and provided by Intel Corporation is seen and heard in various shots throughout the film A Brief History of Time. Morris, with his production crew that consisted of John Bailey, cinematographer, and Phillip Glass, music composer, address the many challenges and restraints that come from Hawking as a passive observer, therefore, the many stylized interview sequences, humorous graphic illustrations, as well as the hypnotic function of music is critical to the wonder and fascination that stems from this documentary. As time was of the essence during the production of this film, the interviews were shot on set stages as opposed to being shot in actual homes. ==Music== In regards to the sound, music, and score featured in the film A Brief History of Time, Morris employed Phillip Glass to create the soundtrack. ===Soundtrack=== ==Reception== A Brief History of Time received largely positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a 93% rating based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 78/100 rating based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". ==Availability== The film was released on VHS in the early 1990s, but remained unreleased via DVD and Blu-ray until 2014, when The Criterion Collection issued a release on April 15, 2014. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * A Brief History of Time from ErrolMorris.com *A Brief History of Time: Macrobiography an essay by David Sterritt at the Criterion Collection Category:1991 films Category:Films with atheism-related themes Category:1990s biographical films Category:1991 documentary films Category:Amblin Entertainment films Category:American films Category:American biographical films Category:American documentary films Category:Biographical films about mathematicians Category:British films Category:British biographical films Category:British documentary films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese biographical films Category:Japanese documentary films Category:Biographical documentary films Category:Documentary films about mathematics Category:Documentary films about science Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Philip Glass Category:Films directed by Errol Morris Category:Films produced by Kathleen Kennedy Category:Films produced by Steven Spielberg Category:Films shot in Cambridgeshire Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire Category:Stephen Hawking ",
