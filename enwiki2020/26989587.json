As a child, she was surrounded by FGC/M but was inspired to focus her work on it by Nawal El Saadawi's book, in which Saadawi describes her own circumcision Nour attended Brown University, and went to Harvard Medical School to get her medical degree. ==Career== As a medical doctor, Nour gathered a group of patients who were all women who had undergone FGM/C. She worked at Brigham and Women's hospital, and in 1999 created the African Women's Health Center, which provides holistic care to women who have been circumcised. She talks about the care they give women: \"The kind of care we give is no better than any other care...We're basically physicians...who understand that there are some women out there who have been circumcised and in some ways it's not something we want to make a big deal about. We want to nurture these patients, but we don't want to ostracize them\" She researches health and policy of FGM/C. Nour has developed and studied difibulation, a surgical process to alleviate some of the negative effects FGM/C has on women's health. Her work aims both to educate doctors caring for women who have been circumcised, and to eradicate FGM/C ==Awards== * 2003 MacArthur Fellows Program * 1998-1999 Reede Scholar http://www.reedescholars.org/scholars/scholar.cfm?id=43 ==Other== Dr Nour joined other thought leaders at Oxford University's OAC: Breaking the Frame[works] conference at the Blavatnik School of Government.
