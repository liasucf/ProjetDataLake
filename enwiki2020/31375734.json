Photo: Maria Jonker The K\u00f6yce\u011fiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area is a protected natural reserve in the Turkish province of Mu\u011fla. In June 1988 it was determined and declared the first protected area of its kind (\u00d6zel \u00c7evre Koruma B\u00f6lgesi) of Turkey. In 1990 the original SPA area was extended westwards.Die Amphibien und Reptilien der S\u00fcdwest-T\u00fcrkei; M. Franzen, M. Bu\u00dfmann, Th. Kordges. B. Thiesmeier; Laurent Verlag; 2008 Up to now, there are fourteen natural reserves with this status, of which Pamukkale is probably the best-known. All these areas are under the supervision of the \u00d6\u00c7KK, the Turkish Environmental Protection Agency for Special Areas. The area got its special status as a result of Prince Philip\u00b4s request to the Turkish Prime Minister Turgut \u00d6zal for a moratorium on the construction of a hotel complex at \u0130ztuzu Beach,Kaptan June and the Turtles; June Haimoff; Janus Publishing 1997 while awaiting an environmental impact assessment. At the time Prince Philip was President of the WWF, which had been approached by environmentalists such as June Haimoff, G\u00fcnther Peter, David Bellamy, Lily Venizelos, Nergis Yazgan and Keith Corbett to help stop the construction of a hotel complex at the beach. \u0130ztuzu Beach was one of the main nesting areas for the endangered loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), and the environmentalists were trying to preserve the turtle\u2019s habitat. In September 1987 the construction project was suspended for an environmental impact assessment, and in 1988 the Turkish government decided upon a construction prohibition because of the area\u2019s special significance. That was not only because of the natural importance of the beach and its significance as a turtle habitat, but also because of the cultural and historical significance and the geological importance of the Dalyan-K\u00f6yce\u011fiz hinterland. Because of its protected status, the area offers good and ample opportunities for ecotourism and recreation. For one, the K\u00f6yce\u011fiz-Dalyan SEPA boasts the most fantastic panoramic vistas. From 1990 onwards the protected status of the area was elaborated in a number of sustainable environmental projects,|Workshop Promoting a sustainable tourism development in Turkey; Koycegiz -Dalyan SPA's projects as an example of good practice; Prof. Dr. Cevat Tosun in order to: * protect and improve its biodiversity; * counter environmental pollution; * establish a balance between developments in agriculture, industry and tourism on the one hand and the environment on the other hand; * protect the area\u2019s ground and surface waters. The SEPA covers an area of 461 km2 and includes the K\u00f6yce\u011fiz, Toparlar, Beyoba\u015f\u0131 and Dalyan districts. There are 17 settlements of which K\u00f6yce\u011fiz on the north bank of the lake, and the tourist town of Dalyan on the river emerging from the lake are the most important ones.Die Amphibien und Reptilien der S\u00fcdwest-T\u00fcrkei; M. Franzen, M. Bu\u00dfmann, Th. Kordges. B. Thiesmeier; Laurent Verlag; 2008 == Description of the area == K\u00f6yce\u011fiz Lake. Photo: Maria Jonker The area consists of various terrestrial structures around the K\u00f6yce\u011fiz subsidence lake. K\u00f6yce\u011fiz Lake is one of Turkey\u2019s largest coastal lakes, which was formed in Antiquity as a result of the formation of a long stretch of dunes (\u0130ztuzu Beach). The lake is fed by the waters of the Namnam river in the northwest and the Yuvarlak\u00e7ay in the east. The latter is reported to be an otter habitat. In the north and west some mountain streams flow into the lake. It is the biotope variety in such a relatively small area that makes the SEPA so special. There are fresh water lakes, rivers and brooks, a vast brackish water zone in the estuary, the sea and its sandy beach. Apart from agricultural land for growing citrus fruit, sesame and cotton, there are wetlands, extensive liquidambar forests, pine forests and maquis. Around the lake there are numerous small wetlands with a rich bird population. Among the birds are the penduline tit, the Eurasian reed warbler, the great reed warbler and black-crowned night heron. The wetlands often border marshy Turkish sweetgum forests. The sweetgum forests are often intersected by ditches and frequently have an undergrowth of horse tail. The Turkish or Oriental sweetgum is an endemic species that thrives in boggy areas and is often seen in combination with plane trees. The species has traditionally been important for the extraction of its sap, which is processed to balsam storax or Turkish sweetgum oil. The sap, which is collected by carefully stripping part of the bark, is used for medical purposes and for the production of perfume. For this reason, the forests used to be of major economical importance. However, there are fewer and fewer master oil makers who can pass on their trade. Unfortunately, the liquidambar forest area has been reduced by illegal tree felling |Specially Protected Area Management -Towards a Sustainable Resource Management and Settlement Development in Turkey, p. 3 Levent Keskin, (Ministry of Environment), Ey\u00fcp Y\u00fcksel (Authority for the Protection of Special Areas) to create new or vaster agricultural fields. Representative sweetgum forests can still be found on the Yuvarlak\u00e7ay near the village of Kavakaras\u0131, on the bank north of Sultaniye, northwest of Hamitk\u00f6y, at K\u00f6yce\u011fiz and at Tepearas\u0131. Nile turtle near mud bath on the Dalyan river. Photo: Maria JonkerAt the south side of Lake K\u00f6yce\u011fiz there is a NW-SE fault, along which several sulphurous thermal springs are located. The only spa resort, at Sultaniye, was restored in the 90\u2019s and has been a popular tourist attraction ever since. The water temperature amounts to 40 \u00b0C. Apart from the thermal spring, it also has a mud bath. There is another mud bath somewhat downriver at a former river branch. This is a location where the Nile turtle (Trionyx triunguis) can be spotted. It is a turtle with a soft shell, thence also called African softshell turtle, which is about 1 metre in size. It is a protected, thermophile species. Consequently, it is often seen near the thermal springs along the fault line. The species occurs near to the sea, in lagoons, lakes, rivers and canals, both in fresh and brackish waters. The Nile turtle is mainly aquatic and will only leave the water for short periods to rest in the sun. In the K\u00f6yce\u011fiz-Dalyan SEPA, oviposition takes place at the brackish waterside of \u0130ztuzu Beach. The Dalyan-K\u00f6yce\u011fiz basin is in the utmost northwest of the species\u2019 range. Northeast and southeast of K\u00f6yce\u011fiz Lake there are lowlands, whereas other parts are surrounded by hills. The highest among these are the \u00d6lemez (937 m) in the southwest, and Bozburun Hill (556 m) in the south. The hills at the periphery of the area are mainly covered with Turkish pine trees (Pinus brutia). The Turkish pine is endemic for the eastern Mediterranean and Turkey is the main part of its range. It usually grows at lower altitudes, from sea level to 600 metres height. The tree reaches a height of 20\u201335 metres, with a maximum trunk diameter of approx. 1 metre. On the river opposite Dalyan are the rock tombs of Caunos, the capital of ancient Caria. From the topmost rows of its amphitheatre and its Acropolis one has a wonderful view of the river, Alag\u00f6l (\u00c7and\u0131r bay) and the reeds at the estuary. Apart from its cultural and historical significance, the historic city is interesting for its abundance of reptiles, birds and insects. Many of the altogether 33 reptile species of the Special Environmental Protected Area can be found at Caunos. Among its most conspicuous species are the hardim or starred agama, the European glass lizard, the common chameleon, and the black whip snake. Moreover, there are numerous tortoises and terrapins at the site. Spectacular birds at and around Caunos are the rock nuthatch, the common kestrel, the blue rock-thrush and the European roller. Wetlands bordering S\u00fcl\u00fcng\u00fcr Lake. Photo: Maria Jonker The Dalyan estuary is a labyrinth of canals through the reeds. During a boat trip through the reeds one can see all sorts of birds, such as kingfishers, the little egret, the great egret and the cormorant. At the west side of the delta is Alag\u00f6l, the bay of \u00c7and\u0131r, which is heated by a number of thermal springs. This may be the reason why the bay is the mating scene for the loggerhead turtle in the second half of April. Oviposition takes place at \u0130ztuzu Beach in May and June. With an average number of nests of approx. 200 per annum (57-330 range over the years of recording), \u0130ztuzu Beach is one of the main breeding areas of the species in the Mediterranean. For this reason there are strict regulations |DEKAMER 2010 Year Report(English and Turkish)]; Pamukkale University to counter any disturbance * From 1 May till 1 October the beach is closed to the public between 20.00 and 08.00 o\u2019clock, in order to rule out disorientation of adult turtles and hatchlings by human disturbance and artificial light. * In the nesting zone, which is marked with stakes, parasols and sun beds are banned and digging is forbidden to prevent nest disturbance or damage. * The presence of vehicles and pets is forbidden at the beach. * Speed boats are forbidden, both on the river and within a zone of 1 mile from the coast. Since May 2009 there has been a sea turtle centre at the beach, run by the Biology Department of Pamukkale University. The staff and volunteers patrol the beach and keep records during the breeding season. Injured turtles found at the beach or at the estuary are taken to the centre for treatment and rehabilitation. The beach is also accessible by road. The route leads along the wetlands of S\u00fcl\u00fcng\u00fcr Lake, which is shut off for boat traffic at the river side by a dalyan or fishing weir. On Bozburun Tepesi above \u0130ztuzu Beach lies a radar station, which offers a wonderful panoramic vista of the K\u00f6yce\u011fiz-Dalyan SEPA. == References and external links == * (English) \u00d6\u00c7KK website Environmental Protection Agency for Special Areas *Die Amphibien und Reptilien der S\u00fcdwest-T\u00fcrkei; M.
