Amitabh Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan appear in cameo roles. The film was theatrically released in India on 28 May 1999, receiving generally positive reviews from critics, and proved to be the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. The film was nominated for seven awards at the 45th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film (Bhagnani), Best Director (Dhawan), Best Actress (Karisma Kapoor), and Best Comedian (Khan and Anil Kapoor), winning Best Supporting Actress (Sen). It is a remake of the 1995 Tamil-language film Sathi Leelavathi. ==Plot== Prem (Salman Khan) is married to the loving yet traditional Pooja (Karishma Kapoor), and together they have two children. One day, Rupali Walia (Sushmita Sen) arrives at Prem's office to give an interview for the role of a model. Prem and Rupali are attracted to each other and ultimately they fall in love. Rupali is much preferable to Prem due to her modern lifestyle and fashionable choices, as compared to Pooja. On Karva Chauth, a religious ceremony observed by married couples, Pooja discovers Prem at Rupali's house and asks him to choose between his mistress and his family. Prem chooses Rupali and moves in with her, leaving his children and mother (Himani Shivpuri) behind with Pooja. Pooja, meanwhile, with the help of Prem's friend Lakhan (Anil Kapoor), has a make-over, becoming a modern woman and taking on modeling assignments. Pooja sends her mother-in-law and children to live with her husband and Rupali. They intentionally trouble Rupali and convince Prem that Rupali keeps them hungry and wants to poison and kill them. Ultimately the relationship between Prem and Rupali breaks down. In the end, Prem realizes that Rupali only came to him since he gave her material things, while his wife stuck with him through thick and thin. Rupali realizes her mistake and gets back together with her ex-boyfriend, Deepak (Saif Ali Khan). In a twist, Lakhan befriends Rupali, affectionately calling her his sister. While hugging her, his wife Lovely (Tabu) walks upon them and misunderstands the situation. She leaves the house crying, but Lakhan chases after and they make up; with Lakhan saying to Lovely that she is his \"Biwi no. 1.\" == Cast == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Actor / Actress !! Role !!
