    "text": "To Save Humanity is a 2015 anthology of 96 essays on global health by authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and Nobel Prize winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: \"What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?\" The collection was edited by Julio Frenk and Steven J. Hoffman. == Reception == The Global Strategy Lab called the collection \"unparalleled\" and \"a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development,\" and featured it in their annual conference. The Health Impact Fund also featured the collection at their conference. The Lancet described the book as \"testimony to the complexity of global health politics,\" and called it \"a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals.\" Vox has republished several of the articles for free online as part of a series entitled \"One Change to Save the World.\" == Essays by notable figures == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Author !Essay Title |- |Fazle Hasan Abed |Harnessing Women's Agency |- |Recep Akdag |Leadership for Health Equity |- |Michelle Bachelet |Governance and Leadership for Health |- |Joyce Banda |Prioritizing Vulnerable Populations |- |Seth Berkley |Vaccines- Accelerating Access For All |- |Ela Bhatt |Improving Health By Addressing Poverty |- |Agnes Binagwaho |Biosocial Education For All |- |Michael Bloomberg |City Leadership on Climate Change |- |Albina du Boisrouvray |Health Is Not Alone |- |Irina Bokova |Education First |- |Larry Brilliant |Pandemic's One-Two-Three Punch |- |Gro Harlem Bruntdland |Equality is the Future |- |Felipe Calderon |Prioritizing Health in Politics |- |Ray Chambers |Committing to Unbridled Collaboration |- |Margaret Chan |Climate's Big Health Warning |- |Helen Clark |Tackling Obesity and Overweight |- |Bill Clinton |Preventing Premature Deaths |- |Paul Collier |HIV Treatment, A Moral Duty |- |Francis S.
