    "text": "Raiva Dam (, also known as Barragem do Coi\u00e7o) is a concrete gravity dam on the Mondego. It is located in the municipality Penacova, in Coimbra District, Portugal. The dam was completed in 1981. It is owned by Companhia Portuguesa de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o de Electricidade (CPPE). The dam is used for power generation and flood control. ==Dam== Raiva Dam is a 36 m tall (height above foundation) and 200 m long gravity dam with a crest altitude of 64.5 m. The volume of the dam is 85,000 m\u00b3. The spillway with 2 radial gates is part of the dam body (maximum discharge 2,000 m\u00b3/s). There is also a bottom outlet. ==Reservoir== At full reservoir level of 61.5 m the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 2.3 km\u00b2 and a total capacity of 24.11 mio. m\u00b3. The active capacity is 14.71 (12) mio. m\u00b3. The reservoir of Raiva Dam serves as lower reservoir for the Aguieira pumped-storage power plant, which is located about 10 km upstream of Raiva dam. ==Power plant == The hydroelectric power plant was commissioned in 1982 (1981). It is operated by EDP. The plant has a nameplate capacity of 24 (20) MW. Its average annual generation is 44.9 (44, 44.8, or 46) GWh. The power station contains 2 Francis turbine-generators (horizontal shaft) with 13 MW (13 MVA) in a dam powerhouse located on the left side of the dam. The turbine rotation is 200 rpm. The minimum hydraulic head is 12 m, the maximum 18 m. Maximum flow per turbine is 80 m\u00b3/s. ==See also== * List of power stations in Portugal * List of dams and reservoirs in Portugal ==References== Category:Dams in Portugal Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Portugal Category:Gravity dams Category:Dams completed in 1981 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in Portugal Category:Buildings and structures in Coimbra District ",
