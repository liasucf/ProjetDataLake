M., (Interviewee). (1992). SRCD Oral History Interview [Interview transcript]. Retrieved from Society for Research in Child Development Web Site:http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/hetherington_mavis_interview.pdf After receiving her masters, she applied to the graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley where she earned her Ph.D. in clinical and developmental psychology in 1958. At Berkeley, Hetherington studied under Leo Postman who influenced her to become involved in research instead of becoming a practitioner. == Marriage and career == Hetherington met her husband, John Hetherington, while working on her Ph.D. She started her academic career at Rutgers University-Newark. In 1960, Hetherington and her husband both decided to get teaching jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While teaching in Wisconsin, Hetherington experienced some discrimination by being paid far less than the men while out publishing them and being one of the most popular professors. Throughout her career she published more than 200 research articles and edited 13 books. Hetherington has received many awards throughout her career including the Distinguished Teaching in Developmental Psychology Award from the APA. She also was honored with the Distinguished Scientist Awards from multiple organizations, the Society for Research in Child Development, the American Psychological Society, the American Family Therapy Association, the Society for Research in Adolescence, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, and the National Council on Family Relations. == Major contributions == === Virginia Longitudinal Study of Divorce and Remarriage. === In 1972, E. Mavis Hetherington and colleagues started a 20-year Longitudinal Study of Divorce and Remarriage. Hetherington followed 450 families who had children that were 4 years of age and lived in Virginia. Today, some of those children are adults and have also been divorced or remarried. This has allowed Hetherington to study the effects of divorce and remarriage throughout generations. Numerous follow up studies have also been completed from this data. Findings have caused controversy and a new perspective on divorce, remarriage, and families. Hetherington and colleagues found that divorce is devastating but not as devastating as most theorists have concluded. She also discovered that divorce can't be looked at as a single event but must be viewed as a process of transitions and perspectives from the entire family. Hetherington concluded that social interactions of the family will affect the outcomes of divorce and remarriage and variations of outcomes must be acknowledged. === Late life === Throughout Hetherington's career at the University of Virginia she made great strides with their psychology program by bringing them up to national status in the psychology world. Hetherington's research continues as our generation strays farther away from traditional marriages and replacing it with cohabitation, remarriages, and single parent house holds. Due to her husband's illness Hetherington retired in 1999 after 29 years at the University of Virginia, but her research still continues through the students she worked with. == References == Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian psychologists Category:Canadian women psychologists Category:Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark faculty Category:University of Virginia faculty Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni ",
