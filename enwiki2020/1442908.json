He fought as an amateur for eleven years and was a member of the Cuban national team until he was 25. Diaz fought the F\u00e9lix Sav\u00f3n twice, and he reportedly scored two knockdowns in the fights, but Savon won both by decision. ==Professional career== On August 13, 2004 Diaz upset highly regarded and undefeated Cuban heavyweight prospect and former cruiserweight champion Juan Carlos Gomez with a vicious 1 round TKO. Still in 2004 he scored a victory over former title challenger Vaughn Bean. However, his ascension was derailed on January 22, 2005 via a 5 round TKO loss to Nigerian power puncher Samuel Peter. He did not manage to score a win ever since, losing four out of his last six fights with two no contests. His last bout was in 2006 December when he was knocked out by former world champion Oliver McCall. His current professional record stands at 13 wins (8 KOs) 5 losses and 2 no contests in 20 bouts. ==Professional boxing record== |- |align=\"center\" colspan=8|13 Wins (8 knockouts, 5 decisions), 5 Losses (2 knockouts, 3 decisions), 2 No Contests |- | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Result | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Record | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Opponent | align=\"center\" style=\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Type | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Round | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Date | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Location | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Notes |-align=center |Loss | |align=left| Oliver \"Atomic Bull\" McCall |KO |7 |09/12/2006 |align=left| Hollywood, Florida, United States |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Damian Wills |UD |8 |08/06/2006 |align=left| Hollywood, California, United States |align=left| |- |No Contest | |align=left| Jason \"Big Six\" Estrada |NC |1 |13/02/2006 |align=left| Providence, Rhode Island, United States |align=left| |- |No Contest | |align=left| Derek Berry |NC |1 |12/11/2005 |align=left| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Kirk \"Bubba\" Johnson |TD |5 |09/06/2005 |align=left| Temecula, California, United States |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Samuel \"Nigerian Nightmare\" Peter |TKO |5 |22/01/2005 |align=left| Miami, Florida, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Vaughn \"Shake & Bake\" Bean |SD |10 |12/11/2004 |align=left| Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Marcellus Brown |TKO |1 |17/09/2004 |align=left| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Juan Carlos \"Pantera Negra\" Gomez |TKO |1 |13/08/2004 |align=left| Laredo, Texas, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Sione Asipeli |UD |6 |19/06/2004 |align=left| Reno, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Aurelio Perez |UD |8 |01/05/2004 |align=left| Miami, Florida, United States |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Tony \"The Tiger\" Thompson |UD |8 |27/03/2004 |align=left| Stateline, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| \"Famous\" Michael Simms |MD |6 |21/02/2004 |align=left| Reno, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Jason Stinson |TKO |1 |11/12/2003 |align=left| Lemoore, California, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Roy Meador |TKO |3 |05/12/2003 |align=left| Los Angeles, California, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Germain Thedford |UD |4 |13/11/2003 |align=left| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Andriy Oliynyk |TKO |2 |01/11/2003 |align=left| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Salvador Farnetti |KO |2 |14/06/2003 |align=left| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Juan Ramon Perez |TKO |2 |28/03/2003 |align=left| Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Juan Ramon Perez |TKO |5 |01/11/2002 |align=left| Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico |align=left| |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:Cuban male boxers ",
