He built Bit-hilani, a monumental palace in Neo-Hittite style discovered by Max von Oppenheim in 1911, with a rich decoration of statues and relief orthostats. In 894 BC, the Assyrian king Adad-nirari II recorded the site in his archives as a tributary Aramaean city-state. In 808 BC the city and its surrounding area was reduced to a province of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. This relief carving was found at the temple-palace of Guzana. It depicts two heroes subduing a foe.
