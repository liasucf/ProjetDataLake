In 2008, 75% of Colorado voters voted to retain Eid on the Supreme Court. In May 2017, Justice Eid found that imposing an eighty-four year sentence on a fifteen-year-old murderer did not violate the Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment prohibition on sentencing juveniles to life without parole because the punishment was styled as an aggregate term-of-years sentence.. In May 2016, she was included on President Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court justices. ==Federal judicial service== On June 7, 2017, President Trump nominated Eid to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, to the seat vacated by Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was elevated to the United States Supreme Court.
