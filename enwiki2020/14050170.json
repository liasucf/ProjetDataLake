He directed films in Czechoslovakia, USA and Germany including Erotikon and Ecstasy. ==Life== He was born August\u00edn Otokar Jan Machat\u00fd in Prague. His father was a real estate investor. Machat\u00fd didn't finish high school and started to work in movies as a teenager. He worked as a cinema pianist, actor, screenwriter, producer and art director. He directed his first movie Teddy by kou\u0159il in 1919. In 1920 he left to USA, worked for Universal Pictures and came back in 1922. In 1926 he finally managed to secure funds for his movie The Kreutzer Sonata. The film was a success and led to Machat\u00fd getting offers to direct. His next movie Schweik in Civilian Life was not successful. Machat\u00fd spent two years studying foreign movies and entered the period in which made the best movies of his career. In 1929 he made an symbolist drama Erotikon, in 1931 a social drama From Saturday to Sunday and an adaptation of Karel Pol\u00e1\u010dek's novel Na\u010deradec, kr\u00e1l kibic\u016f and in 1933 his best known film Ecstasy. Ecstasy was screened in Venice Film Festival and made both Machat\u00fd and its lead actress Hedy Lamarr internationally famous. They both received offer to work for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After making Nocturno in Germany and Ballerine in Italy he decided to accept the offer and traveled to the US. However his American career was filled only by low-level contract work for the studio and MGM producers didn't have any interest in his ideas. From 1940 to 1943 he worked for RKO directing only camera test footage with starting actors. In 1945 he managed to direct Jealousy for a smaller production company Republic Pictures.
