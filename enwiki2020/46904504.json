    "text": "The 2015 Sabah earthquake () struck Ranau, Sabah, Malaysia with a moment magnitude of 6.0 on 5 June, which lasted for 30 seconds. The earthquake was the strongest to affect Malaysia since the 1976 Sabah earthquake. Tremors were also felt in Tambunan, Tuaran, Kota Kinabalu, Inanam, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat, Likas, Penampang, Putatan, Kinarut, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Beluran, Sandakan, Kunak, Tawau in Sabah and as far afield as Federal Territory of Labuan, Lawas, Limbang and Miri in Sarawak as well as Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei. Eighteen fatalities were reported, all occurring on Mount Kinabalu, including nine Singaporeans, six Malaysians, and three miscellaneous nationals. About 137 climbers were stranded on the mountain but were subsequently rescued. As a result of the earthquake, most areas in the Kinabalu Park have been closed temporarily until the situation is cleared and undergoing repairs and rehabilitation. ==Tectonic setting== Sabah lies within the Sunda Plate away from any plate boundaries. It was the location of a convergent plate boundary until some time during the Early Miocene. Since then Sabah has been massively uplifted, with the Kinabalu Granite, which was emplaced during the early Late Miocene (between 7.8\u20137.2 million years ago), being exhumed at a rate of 7 mm per year during Late Miocene\u2013Early Pliocene (~ 8\u20133 Ma ago). the region continues to rise at a long term rate of about 0.5 mm each year.Hall, R., Cottam, M.A., Suggate, S., Tongkul, F., Sperber, C. & Batt, G. 2009. The Geology of Mount Kinabalu. Sabah Parks Publication, 13. (in pg. 16) The uplift is thought to be a result of either break-off of the subducted slab or delamination of the lithosphere. Despite not being at a plate boundary, GPS measurements show that the coastal part of Sabah is moving towards the north-west. The uplift is thought to be driving gravitational collapse with sliding of the northwestern part of Sabah being accommodated by extension. This is consistent with the focal mechanism of earlier earthquakes in the onshore area. ==Earthquake== The earthquake occurred on 5 June 2015 at 07:15 a.m. MST (23:15:43 UTC) at a depth of approximately , with its epicentre approximately north of Ranau and lasting for thirty seconds. The earthquake was initially reported as 6.0 Mw by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) while the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) reported the earthquake's magnitude to be 5.9 Ms. ===Cause=== USGS ShakeMap for the event The earthquake was caused by movement on a SW-NE trending normal fault. As the epicentre of the earthquake was near to Mount Kinabalu, the shaking caused massive landslides around the mountain. ====Local native beliefs==== According to the claims of local natives, the earthquake was caused by \"aki\" (the mountain protectors) who had become angered over the acts of ten western tourists (comprising six men and four women from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) who \"stripped and urinated at the mountain (which is believed by local natives as a sacred place) on 30 May\", six days before the earthquake happened. The tourists also shouted vulgarities when they were told to desist by their mountain guide. The acts provoked outrage among Sabahan natives who want all of the alleged offenders charged in native court and forced to pay the \"sogit\", a type of compensation, given in the form of money or livestock, to appease the aggrieved party according to local Kadazan-Dusun native customs. It is imposed on wrongdoers for the purpose of appeasing \"the aggrieved\", thus placating the native community. However, as most of the detained tourists have been released from Malaysia's prison and escaping native court, the local villagers had performed their own rituals. The misconduct was also condemned by the Science Adviser to the Malaysian Prime Minister who said: The brother of one of the deceased mountain guides also criticised the behaviour of the tourists, saying: Following the incident, some of the tourist and their family members has express their apology to all involved parties with the United Kingdom government began to reviewing their travelling advice to Malaysia. ===Aftershocks=== In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that evening, three aftershocks occurred, with the first and second at 21:10 MST and 23:13 MST respectively, measuring 4.3 magnitude both, while a third at 23:32 MST was 2.8 Mw. By 23 June 90 aftershocks had been reported at Ranau by the Malaysian Meteorological Department, ranging in magnitudes from 1.6 to 5.2. ===Casualties=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\" style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-top:0; margin-right:0; clear:right;\" |+Casualties by country |- !Country !!Deaths !!Ref. |- | | align=right| 10 | |- | | align=right| 6 | |- | | align=right| 1 | |- | | align=right| 1 | |- ! style=\"text-align:left\"|Total ! style=\"text- align:right\"|18 ! |} 187 climbers were impacted, according to Sabah official sources, with most of them from Malaysia and Singapore, and others from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. 137 of them were stranded but subsequently rescued. The majority of fatalities were teachers and students from a Singaporean climbing group from the Tanjong Katong Primary School; initially reportedly missing, the Singaporeans were later officially confirmed dead by the Singaporean Ministry of Education with an official statement released on 10 June. Malaysian nationals accounted for the second most number of deaths, including two climbers (revised downwards from three initially reported missing) and four mountain guides. Subsequent investigation and witness by other climbers found that the four mountain guides died while protecting climbers. The four guides were identified as Robbi Sapinggi, Valerian Joannes, Ricky Masirin and Joseph Solungin. A Japanese climber also died while protecting one of the Singaporean school students as revealed by the owner of the accommodation where the climber stayed. ====List of the dead==== As of 10 June, 18 people of 4 nationalities were confirmed dead: : * Lu Qi (aged 35) : * Ozaki Masahiro (29) * Joseph Solungin (33) * Lim Choon Seong (45) * Muhammad Loqman Abdul Karim (22) * Ricky Masirin (28) * Robbi Sapinggi (31) * Valerian James (30) : * Ameer Ryyan Mohd Adeed Sanjay (12) * Emilie Giovanna Ramu (12) * Matahom Karyl Higuit (12) * Muhammad Daanish Amran (22) * Muhammad Ghazi Mohammed (35) * Navdeep Singh Jaryal Raj Kumar (13) * Peony Wee Ying Ping (12) * Rachel Ho Yann Shiuan (12) * Sonia Jhala (12) * Terrence Sebastion Loo Jian Liang (29) ===Damage=== Donkey Ear's Peak, prior to earthquake damage which reduced the size of the prominences During the earthquake, one of the peaks on Mount Kinabalu (called the Donkey's Ears) was broken off. The source of the Poring Hot Springs a popular tourist area near Ranau, turned murky and black for a few hours due to the earthquake, which disrupted a clay deposit that interrupts the fault gap that heats up the rainwater. Some infrastructure was reported damaged with around 23 schools in six different districts affected, and Ranau Mosque was also damaged due to the tremor. Serious damage occurred to the hostels and resthouse near the summit of Mount Kinabalu. Buildings were similarly affected by the earthquake in Kota Belud and Tuaran. The areas around Kundasang and Ranau suffered water supply disruption when the main water drainage pipe burst, and several plants in both regions were damaged with a leakage in the deposition tank. ==Response== Sabah local mountain guides became the first rescuers during the situation, as reported by an Australian climber. Government agencies like the Fire and Rescue Department, Royal Malaysia Police and Malaysian Armed Forces provided equipment during the rescue missions as was reported by the mountain guides.
