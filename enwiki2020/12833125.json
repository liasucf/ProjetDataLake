    "text": "Grevillea striata, also known as beefwood, is a tree or shrub native to all Australian states, with the exception of Victoria and Tasmania. Alternative common names for this species include western beefwood, beef oak, beef silky oak and silvery honeysuckle. ==Description== The plant exhibits a range of growth forms, from a spindly shrub ~3m metres in height to a robust tree up to 15 metres. The trunk is covered in rough, brown, furrowed bark. The leaves are long, narrow and straplike, 10 to 45 cm long and up to 1 cm wide. Creamy- yellow flowers are produced in cylindrical spikes predominantly from August to December in Australia (late winter to early summer) although they may appear at other times of the year. These are followed by woody, beaked seed capsules which are about 1.5 cm long. It is a long-lived tree. In New South Wales, a tree still stands which bears an inscription in memory of a member of Charles Sturt's expedition in 1845. James Poole, having died of scurvy, was buried near the Beefwood tree at Preservation Creek near Milparinka, and an inscription \"JP 1845\" was carved into the tree.

Due to its durability and the fact that it splits readily, the timber was used in the past for fence posts and shingles. It is known as Beefwood due to the intense red colour of its heartwood. ==References== ==External links== * * striata Category:Trees of Australia Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) Category:Drought-tolerant trees ",
