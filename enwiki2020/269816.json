They are yellow rodent-like creatures (large-eared pika) with powerful electrical abilities. In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, they are primarily voiced by Ikue \u014ctani. A Pikachu also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu, played in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds. The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pok\u00e9mon video games, Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, for the original Game Boy. Pikachu are one of the most well-known varieties of Pok\u00e9mon, largely because Pikachu is a central character (starter Pok\u00e9mon of Ash) in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series. Pikachu is a major character of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years and one of the major mascots for Nintendo. ==Concept and design== Pikachu as depicted in promotional artwork for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, its first appearance Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pok\u00e9mon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called \"Pok\u00e9mon\" that players, called \"trainers\", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pok\u00e9mon or interact with the game's world. Pikachu was one of several different Pok\u00e9mon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design, which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori. According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric spark makes, and chu, a sound a mouse makes. Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's generation 1 design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.https://kotaku.com/pikachu-wasnt-based-on-a-mouse-but-a- squirrel-1825738117 Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences. Standing tall, Pikachu were the first \"Electric-type\" Pok\u00e9mon created, their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity. They appear as Pika-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.Pok\u00e9dex: It lives in forests with others. It stores electricity in the pouches on its cheeks. In Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent at the end of its tail, giving it a heart- shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or \"evolve,\" into a Raichu when exposed to a \"Thunderstone.\" In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named \"Pichu\", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer. Initially both Pikachu and the Pok\u00e9mon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more \"engaging\". However, with the production of the animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers, and because it was believed that Pikachu presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet to children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact that the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh. Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls, the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own, with the company responsible for the production of the animated series OLM, Inc. giving the suggestion to utilize Pikachu's potential to Game Freak, and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily. Pikachu was originally going to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu. ==Appearances== ===In video games=== Red in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow. In the video games, Pikachu is a Pok\u00e9mon which has appeared in all of the games, except Black and White, without having to trade. The game Pok\u00e9mon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available Starter Pok\u00e9mon. Based on the Pikachu from the Pok\u00e9mon anime, it refuses to stay in its Pok\u00e9 Ball, and instead follows the main character around on screen. The trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending on how it is treated. Pok\u00e9mon Yellow followed the anime series closely, with Pikachu as a central character. Pok\u00e9mon Let's Go, which is based heavily on Yellow, has Pikachu as a starter in one of its two versions, with the latter version using Eevee instead. In Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, Pikachu and its evolutionary family gained Volt Tackle as a signature move, learned by the Pichu hatched from an Egg made by a Pikachu or Raichu holding a Light Ball. It can also be learned by Pikachu directly through events and tutors. An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010 allowed players of Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the Pok\u00e9walker which solely contained Pikachu which knew attacks that they were not normally compatible with, Surf and Fly. Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids. Seven \"Cap\" forms of Pikachu, wearing caps belonging to anime protagonist Ash Ketchum across different seasons, were released across Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon as well as their Ultra versions. These games also released two Z-Crystals exclusive to Pikachu: Pikanium Z, which upgrades Volt Tackle into Catastropika, and Pikashunium Z, which upgrades Thunderbolt into 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt when held by a Cap form of Pikachu.

The Pok\u00e9mon anime series and films feature the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, traveling through the various regions of the Pok\u00e9mon universe. They are accompanied by a group of alternating friends, including Misty, Brock, Tracey, May, Max, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Bonnie, Serena, Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, and Goh. In the first episode, Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pok\u00e9mon. Hopeful to become a Pok\u00e9mon Master, the night before he receives his starter Pok\u00e9mon (either Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur) he has a dream where he is catching a Pok\u00e9mon and actually, while sleeping, physically breaks his alarm clock. Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak's lab, where he finds out all the starter Pok\u00e9mon have been given away. Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more Pok\u00e9mon, a male Pikachu. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pok\u00e9mon transportation, a Pok\u00e9 Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, then rushes the electric mouse to a Pok\u00e9mon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pok\u00e9mon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. However, he still refuses to go into his Pok\u00e9 Ball. Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets him apart from other Pok\u00e9mon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture him in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni. Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu, and that was in the episode \"Pikachu's Goodbye\", because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu, but Pikachu chose him instead. Other wild and trained Pikachu appear throughout the series, often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu. The most notable among these is Ritchie's Pikachu, Sparky. Like most other Pok\u00e9mon, Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables of his own name. He is voiced by Ikue \u014ctani in all versions of the anime.
