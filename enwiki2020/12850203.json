The company's headquarters is located in the German city of Rostock while management is situated in Hamburg. Production takes place in Rostock as well as in China and for a brief time in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[url=http://talkbusiness.net/2014/06/trinity-industries-re-open- nordex-factory-jonesboro/ Trinity Industries To Locate Railcar Facility At Nordex Factory In Jonesboro] The company was founded in 1985 in Give, Denmark. Since then the company steadily grew. In 1995 Nordex was the first company to mass-produce a 1 MW turbine booster. == Wind turbines == As of 2013, the third generation of Nordex wind turbines included two platforms, rated at 2.4 and 3.3 MW. In Europe, Africa and North America Nordex manufactures and sells the Gamma series, a product family comprising the N90/2500, the N100/2500 and the N117/2400. The N90/2500 is a turbine being developed for strong winds. The N100/2500 consists of two versions, Highspeed and Lowspeed, the first one for rather windy locations, the second for medium wind conditions. The N117/2400 was designed especially for low-wind regions (IEC 3). The hub height of the 2.4-2.5 MW windturbines reaches from 65 meters for the N90/2500 to 141 meters for the low wind version of the N117/2400. === Technical data 2.5MW Gamma classNordex platform brochure Gamma-Generation === N100/2500 in the United States.

There will be two new types of turbines, the N100/3300 strong-wind turbine and the N117/3000, which is designed for medium-wind sites. Both turbines feature the rotorblades already used in the Gamma-Series, with the rotorblades of the N117 being slightly upgraded to withstand the higher wind speeds in IEC wind class 2a. Both turbines are equipped with a three-stage gearbox and a doubly fed asynchronous generator.http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1169324/Close---Nordex- launches-Delta-turbine-series-EWEAhttp://www.nordex- online.com/fileadmin/MEDIA/Kundenzeitschrift/EN/Nordex-Magazin_360_01_en.pdf == See also == *Lamma Winds *List of wind turbine manufacturers *Wind power in Germany *Offshore wind power ==References== == External links == * Category:Wind turbine manufacturers Category:Engineering companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Category:German brands Category:Societates Europaeae Category:Renewable resource companies established in 1985 Category:Danish companies established in 1985 ",
