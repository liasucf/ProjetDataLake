    "text": "McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25 (1931), was a United States Supreme Court case. == Background == William McBoyle transported a plane that he knew to be stolen from Ottawa, Illinois to Guymon, Oklahoma. == Case == McBoyle was accused of violating the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act.National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, October 29, 1919, c. 89, 41 Stat 324 The petitioners claimed that since the act did not specifically mention aircraft, it did not apply to aircraft. == Decision == The court held that, since other acts \u2013 such as the Tariff Act of 1930Tariff Act, June 17, 1930, c. 997, \u00a7 401 (b) \u2013 specifically excluded aircraft in its definition of a vehicle, the law must be interpreted narrowly. Justice Holmes stated: > Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text > of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning > should be given to the world in language that the common world will > understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To > make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. This case is a good example of the canon of ejusdem generis (\"of the same kind, class, or nature\"). ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 283 ==References== == External links == * * Category:1931 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States statutory interpretation case law Category:Texas County, Oklahoma Category:Vehicle law Category:Aviation security Category:Ottawa, Illinois Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Hughes Court ",
