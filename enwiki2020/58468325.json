    "text": "In chemistry, the bicapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry describes the shape of compounds where eight atoms or groups of atoms or ligands are arranged around a central atom defining the vertices of a biaugmented triangular prism. This shape has C2v symmetry and is one of the three common shapes for octacoordinate transition metal complexes, along with the square antiprism and the dodecahedron.Wells A.F.
