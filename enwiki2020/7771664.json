It started with 5 classes in the English stream and 4 in the Chinese Stream. Mr Mohd Said B H A Samad, the principal-designate, served the school for three and a half years until June 1981. Mr Soh Guan Ba took over as principal from June 1981 to December 1995. Mr Ee Chye Heng joined the school from 1995 to 2000, after which Mr Khairunan bin Ali took over the post. From 2008 to 2011, Mr Boo Chong Han was principal. In 2012 to 2015, Mr Jeffrey Low took over as principal. From 2016, Mrs Valerie Pinto is the principal. In January 1978 the school began functioning in its current premises and was officially opened on 28 September 1979 by Tuan Haji Sha'ari Tadin, former MP for Bedok. It was the 139th school built by the government and the first government secondary school in Bedok New Town. In 1992 major alterations and renovations were carried out, and a 4-storey classroom block was built under the Extension and Alteration Project. The school now has 36 classrooms, a language laboratory, a commerce room, two computer laboratories and six science laboratories. Extensions to the library, staff room and canteen were also carried out. The school subsequently underwent the Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME) and the entire project was completed in mid-2005, providing up-to-date facilities for pupils and staff.
