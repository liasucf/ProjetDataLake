    "text": "The Solway Aviation Museum is an independently run aircraft museum located at Carlisle Lake District Airport in Cumbria. It is closed during 2020 on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==About the Museum== The Museum is run by The Solway Aviation Society Ltd and staffed by unpaid volunteers. The Society is a registered charity supported by entrance charges to the Museum, and public donations. In addition to normal opening (Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays plus Bank Holidays from April until October end) the Museum hosts educational visits for school classes studying the Second World War and for Scout, Cub and Beaver packs achieving their Air Activities Badge. Following the closure of the RAF Millom Museum many of the artefacts were moved to Solway Aviation Museum for safe keeping and eventual exhibition when space permits. The Museum is now the sole aviation Museum left in Cumbria. The Buildings contain exhibits and artefacts relating to aviation in Cumbria, including the Second World War and also houses individual displays featuring the development of Blue Streak, Martin Baker ejection seats and the development and activities of the Airport itself since the Second World War. ==The Collection== The current collection includes the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
