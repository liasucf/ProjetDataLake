    "text": "The city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (), known colloquially as Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (\"white castle\"), located in central Hungary, is the ninth largest city of the country; regional capital of Central Transdanubia; and the centre of Fej\u00e9r county and Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r District. The area is an important rail and road junction between Lake Balaton and Lake Velence. Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, a royal residence (sz\u00e9khely),sz\u00e9k meaning \"seat\", i.e. \"throne\") as capital of the Kingdom of Hungary, held a central role in the Middle Ages. As required by the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, the first kings of Hungary were crowned and buried here. Significant trade routes led to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna. Historically the city has come under Ottoman and Habsburg control, and was known in many languages by translations of \"white castle\": (, , , ) ==History== La T\u00e8ne Silver hinged brooch found in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, dating from 1-100 AD (British MuseumBritish Museum Collection). ===Pre-Hungarian=== The place has been inhabited since the 5th century BC. In Roman times the settlements were called Gorsium and Herculia. After the Migration Period Fej\u00e9r County was the part of the Avar Khaganate,See: B\u00f3na Istv\u00e1n: Avar lovass\u00edr Iv\u00e1ncs\u00e1r\u00f3l [Grave of an Avar horseman at Iv\u00e1ncsa]. In: Arch\u00c9rt 97. (1970). 243\u2013264. while the Slavic and Great Moravian presence is disputed. (There is no source for the name of the place before the late 10th century.) In the Middle Ages its Latin name was Alba Regalis/Alba Regia. The town was an important traffic junction between Lake Balaton and Lake Velence, several trade routes led from here to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna. (Today, the town is a junction of seven railroad lines.) ===Early Hungarian=== Later Gothic St. Anna Chapel built around 1485. Grand Prince G\u00e9za of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty was the nominal overlord of all seven Magyar tribes but in reality ruled only part of the united territory. He aimed to integrate Hungary into Christian Western Europe by rebuilding the state according to the Western political and social models. G\u00e9za founded the Hungarian town in 972 on four moorland islands between the Gaja stream and its tributary, the S\u00e1rv\u00edz, one of the most important Hungarian tributaries of the Danube. He also had a small stone castle built. Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was first mentioned in a document by the Bishopric of Veszpr\u00e9m, 1009, as Alba Civitas. Stephen I of Hungary granted town rights to the settlement, surrounded the town with a plank wall, and founded a school and a monastery.Previously rendered as \"provosty\"; there is no such word in English but there is in German, see Under his rule the construction of the Romanesque Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Basilica began (it was built between 1003 and 1038). The settlement had about 3,500 inhabitants at this time and was the royal seat for hundreds of years. 43 kings were crowned in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (the last one in 1526) and 15 kings were buried here (the last one in 1540). In the 12th century, the town prospered, churches, monasteries, and houses were built. It was an important station on the pilgrim route to the Holy Land. Andr\u00e1s II issued the Golden Bull here in 1222. The Bull included the rights of nobles and the duties of the king, and the Constitution of Hungary was based on it until 1848. It is often compared to England's Magna Charta. During the Mongol Invasion of Hungary (1241\u20131242), the invaders could not get close to the castle: Kadan ruled Mongol warriors could not get through the surrounding marshes because of flooding caused by melting snow. In the 13th\u201315th centuries, the town prospered, and several palaces were built. In the 14th century, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was surrounded by city walls. After the death of King M\u00e1ty\u00e1s (1490), the German army of 20,000 men of Maximilian invaded Hungary. They advanced into the heart of Hungary and captured the city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which he sacked, as well as the tomb of King M\u00e1ty\u00e1s, which was kept there. His Landsknechts were still unsatisfied with the plunder and refused to go for taking Buda. He returned to the Empire in late December and the Hungarian troops liberated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in the next year. ===Ottoman period=== Serbian Quarter preserved in the middle of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r The Ottomans conquered the city after a long siege in 1543 and only after a sally ended in most of the defenders including the commander, Gy\u00f6rgy Varkoch, being locked out by wealthy citizens fearing they might incur the wrath of the Ottomans by a lengthy siege. They discovered after surrendering, however, that the Ottomans were not without a sense for chivalry and those responsible for shutting the defenders out were put to death. Except for a short period in 1601 when Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was reconquered by an army led by Lawrence of Brindisi, the city remained under Ottoman administration for 145 years, until 1688, with the Ottomans being preoccupied with the Morean War. The Ottomans destroyed most of the city, they demolished the cathedral and the royal palace, and they pillaged the graves of kings in the cathedral. They named the city Belgrade (\"white city\", from Serbian Beograd) and built mosques. In the 16th-17th centuries it looked like a Muslim city. Most of the original population fled. It was a sanjak centre in Budin Province as \"\u0130stolni Belgrad\" during Ottoman rule. ===Habsburg Monarchy=== The city began to prosper again only in the 18th century. It had a mixed population: Hungarians, Germans, Serbs, and Moravians. By 1702, the cathedral of Nagyboldogasszony was blown up,Ferenc Glatz: Magyar t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gia thus destroying the largest cathedral in Hungary at that time, and the coronation temple. By the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, all kings of Hungary were obliged to be crowned in this cathedral, and to take part in coronation ceremony in the surroundings of the cathedral. The coronations after that time were held in Pozsony (now Bratislava). In 1703, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r regained the status of a free royal town. In the middle of the century, several new buildings were erected (Franciscan church and monastery, Jesuit churches, public buildings, Baroque palaces). Maria Theresa made the city an episcopal seat in 1777. By the early 19th century, the German population was assimilated. On 15 March 1848, the citizens joined the revolution. After the revolution and war for independence, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r lost its importance and became a mainly agricultural city. In 1909 The Times Engineering Contract List noted a bridge construction contract valued at \u00a312,000 to be overseen by the Chief Magistrate.The Times (London, England), 15 December 1909; pg. 18 ===Interwar period=== New prosperity arrived between the two world wars, when several new factories were opened. In 1922 a radio station was established. It used two masts insulated against ground, each with a height of 152 metres. The last mast of the station was demolished in 2009. ===World War II=== In 1944, after the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, the city's Jewish population was confined to a ghetto and was eventually deported to the Auschwitz death camp, together with further 3,000 Jews from the area.city in central Hungary at the Beit Hatfutsot (Jewish Diaspora Museum, Tel Aviv) websiteThe Jews of Szekesfehervar & Its Environs, by Dr. Eliezer Even (Koves) & Bemjamin Ravid, Jerusalem, 1997 The pre-war Jewish population consisted of Neolog (Reform) and Orthodox communities with their respective synagogues, and some of its members were active Zionists. In December 1944, Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r came under Russian artillery fire, and stiff fighting broke out as the Red Army advanced on the city.Red Army Eight Miles From Budapest.\u201d The Times 11 December 1944; pg. 4 The Germans had chosen to concentrate their forces to protect the 15 mile gap between Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and Lake Balaton. Whereas most of the gap consisted of marsh and difficult ground, Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was the node for eight highways and six railways.\u201cDrive Towards The Danube.\u201d The Times (London, England), 27 December 1944; pg. 4 Despite the heavy German defences, a Russian flying column broke through and occupied the city on 23 December;Outflanking Budapest.

The Times, 23 January 1945 In March 1945, the area was the battleground for the last major German offensive of World War II; but following its failure Marshal Tolbukhin broke through the German lines once more and recaptured the city on 22 March.Progress Towards Gy\u00f6r, The Times (London, England), Monday, Mar 26, 1945; pg. 4 A Soviet airfield was established at nearby Szabadbatty\u00e1n.Forced Labour Units In Hungary.

In August 1951 over 150 people were killed when two trains collided in Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.Strain On Railways In Hungary. The Times, 16 November 1951 After World War II, the city was subject to industrialization, like many other cities and towns in the country. The most important factories were the Ikarus bus factory, the Videoton radio and TV factory, and the K\u00f6nny\u0171f\u00e9mm\u0171 (colloquially K\u00f6f\u00e9m) aluminium processing plant, since acquired by Alcoa. By the 1970s, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r had swelled to more than 100,000 inhabitants (in 1945 it had only about 35,000). Several housing estates were built, but the city centre preserved its Baroque atmosphere. The most important Baroque buildings are the cathedral, the episcopal palace and the city hall. In the past few decades, archaeologists have excavated medieval ruins (that of the Romanesque basilica and the mausoleum of St. Stephen of Hungary); they can now be visited. At the end of the Socialist regime, all the important factories were on the verge of collapse (some eventually folded) and thousands of people lost their jobs. However, the city profited from losing the old and inefficient companies, as an abundance of skilled labour coupled with excellent traffic connections and existing infrastructure attracted numerous foreign firms seeking to invest in Hungary. Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r became one of the prime destinations for multinational companies setting up shop in Hungary (Ford and IBM are some of them), turning the city into a success story of Hungary's transition to a market economy. A few years later Denso, Alcoa, Philips, and Sanmina-SCI Corporation also settled in the city. ==Culture== ===Architecture=== * Historical centre (Baroque, Classical) buildings * St Stephen Cathedral and ruins of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Basilica (one of the largest basilicas in medieval Europe), where the Diets were held and the crown jewels kept, seat for the coronation of the Hungarian monarch and location of royal burials and memorials. * St Anna Chapel (Gothic, built around 1470) * \"Ruin Garden\": Ruins of medieval church founded by St Stephen * Episcopal Palace (Zopf style) * City Hall * Zichy Palace (Zopf style manor house, 1781) * Serbian Quarter (12 thatched peasant houses and a Byzantine-style church, won a Europa Nostra award in 1990) * Bory Castle (20th century).
