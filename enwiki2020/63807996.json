    "text": "This is a list of submissions to the 93rd Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film every year since the award was created in 1956. The award is presented annually by the Academy to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The International Feature Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. The category was previously called the Best Foreign Language Film, but this was changed in April 2019 to Best International Feature Film, after the Academy deemed the word \"Foreign\" to be outdated. The submitted motion pictures must be first released theatrically in their respective countries between 1 October 2019 and 31 December 2020. ==Submissions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#f;\"} !
