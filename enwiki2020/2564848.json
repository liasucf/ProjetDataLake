    "text": "Japanther is a band established by Matt Reilly and Ian Vanek, then students at Pratt Institute. Japanther was featured in the 2006 Whitney Biennial and the 2011 Venice Biennale, and has collaborated with a diverse pool of artists such as gelitin, Penny Rimbaud, Gee Vaucher, Dan Graham, Eileen Myles, Kevin Bouton-Scott, robbinschilds, Dawn Riddle, Claudia Meza, Todd James, Devin Flynn, Ninjasonik, Anita Sparrow and Spank Rock. Japanther has made its name with unique performance situations, appearing alongside synchronized swimmers, atop the Williamsburg Bridge, with giant puppets, marionettes and shadow puppets, in the back of a moving truck in Soho, and at shows with giant dinosaurs and BMXers flying off the walls. Installations include The Phone Booth Project at Clocktower Gallery in New York. 'Described as \u201cart-rock installation paratroopers\u201d and \u201ca studied form of New Wave anarchism\u201d by Flash Art, a \u201cPerformance Galaxy\u201d by Vanity Fair, \u201cSuper hard, incredibly fast and overall inspiring\u201d by Thrasher, \u201cmore accessible than other bands of its genre\u201d by the New Yorker, and \u201cthe best band ever, straight up\u201d by Tokion. Japanther has always been a band apart, running the gamut from performance art to punk rock and back again. Pushing parties to the limit (\"Lincoln Center punk-rock concert turned mini-riot\u201d -New York Post), Japanther returns in 2011 with Beets, Limes and Rice, a celebration of ten years in the underground and an ultra-contemporary meditation on \"catharsis and being in love in a time of darkness.\". The band's album Beets, Limes and Rice, written in the midst of 84-hour performance piece \"It Never Seems to End,\" was released in digital and vinyl format from Recess Records, on CD from Japanther's own Tapes Records, on cassette from Lauren Records, and by Seayou Records in Europe. The artwork for the album was created by Monica Canilao. Their song \"The Gravy\" was featured in Electronic Arts' 2010 video game Skate 3. == Discography == * The Last of the Living Land Pirates CD-R (2001) * South of Northport EP (2002) * Leather Wings (2003) * Dump the Body in Rikki Lake (2003) * Japanther/Panthers Split 7\" (2003) * The Operating Manual for Life on Earth EP (2004) * Japanther/Sneeze Split 7\" (2004) * Japanther/Viking Club Split CD (2004) * Master of Pigeons (2005) * Wolfenswan (2005) * Yer Living Grave EP (2005) * Don't Trust Anyone Over Thirty (2006) * Japanther/ The Good Good Split 7\" (2006) * Skuffed Up My Huffy (2007) * Challenge 7\" (2008) * Chemical X Zine DVD (2008) * Tut Tut, Now Shake Ya Butt (2008) * Japanther/The Pharmacy Split 7\" (2008) * Rock 'n' Roll Ice Cream (2010) * JapantherNinjasonik 7\" (2010) * Beets, Limes and Rice (2011) * Eat Like Lisa Act Like Bart (2013) * Donut Shop Bounce EP (2014) * Instant Money Magic (2014) * Boom For Real (2016) ==Compilations== * I Think We Should Stay Away From Each Other LP (2011) ==References== == External links == * Spinner Interview * Flavorpill Fix Episode Four Animated and Curated by Japanther * \"Upstairs at the Square,\" with China Mieville * \"Big Apple Circus Goes Indie,\" at the New York Times' T Magazine * \"21 Questions with Ian Vanek\" at the Nervous Breakdown * \"Japanther Warehouse Party,\" (Slideshow) The Village Voice Category:Punk rock groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Rock music duos Category:American noise rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 ",
