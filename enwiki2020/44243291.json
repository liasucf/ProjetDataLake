    "text": "Park Hyoung-su (born August 11, 1972) is a male South Korean writer of fiction born in Chuncheon, Gangwan-do, South Korea.Naver \uc778\ubb3c\uac80\uc0c9: \ubc15\ud615\uc11c. Accessed 29. Aug 2014 (korean). His short story Krabi, named after the Thai resort, has been published in a bilingual edition in France. ==Life== Park was born in Chuncheon, Gangwon-do in 1972 and graduated from Korea University graduate school, with a Ph.D. in 2010 from Korea University Graduate School with a Masters in 2003, and from Hanyang University, a Bachelor of Korean literature in 1999. Park made his literary debut in 2000 through the Hyundae Munhak. He currently teaches creative writing at Korea University. ==Work== Park is an unusual novelist for a Korean, often placing his works outside of Korea, or finding their genesis outside of Korea. and Korean critics have had a difficult time pigeonholing him, various describing him as a \"storyteller\", \"metamorphic\", and \"self-aware\", among other terms. LIST Magazine has summarized Park's role as a modern novelist: \"The novel as a modern invention is what many young Korean writers are pondering as they attempt to redefine the landscape of modern Korean literature. Out of these writers, Park Hyoung- su stands out for the perception, intelligence, and playful imagination so evident in his work. At the moment, his only work translated into English is Arpan (ASIA Publishers) which has been well reviewed at www.ktlit.com as \"another shock to a habitual reader of Korean literature in translation as it treads overseas as well as into cultural relativism, and the position of plagiarism/copying in Korea.\".Oscar.
