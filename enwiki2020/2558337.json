Barents Island has no permanent human inhabitants. Named for the Dutch explorer Willem Barents (who actually never sighted the island), it is a part of S\u00f8raust- Svalbard Nature Reserve. Barents\u00f8ya is an Arctic island. Around 43 per cent of its area of is glaciated. To the north, in the sound between Barents\u00f8ya and Spitsbergen, lies the island of K\u00fckenthal\u00f8ya. To the south, the sound separating Barents Island from Edge\u00f8ya is Freemansundet. In geologic time much of the surface rock has been eroded by glaciation.Svalbard Images The entire area is visited by polar bears, who have a recognisable genetic differentiation specialised to the Barents Sea region. At D\u00f8rstubukta there is also a large nesting mainly used by kittiwakes.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 ==Geography== Aerial view of Edgeoya and Barents\u00f8ya Barents\u00f8ya has an approximately square shape, with maximum lengths and widths of about fifty kilometers, and an area of . A significant part of the island, more than , is glaciated. The ice cap of Barentsj\u00f8kulen covers a large part of the island, with the largest offspring Besselsbreen (north), Duckwitzbreen (west), Freemanbreen (south), and H\u00fcbnerbreen (southeast). Barentsj\u00f8kulen has the two large ice domes of Peer Gyntslottet and Solveigdomen. The mountain of Schweinfurthberget is a nunatak of Barentsj\u00f8kulen. At the northern side of Barents\u00f8ya is the ice-free peninsula of Frankenhalv\u00f8ya, between Ginevra Bay at the western side and Dorstbukta to the east. Grimheia is an ice-free mountainous area extending over a length of about thirteen kilometers at the northern part of the island. The westernmost point of the island is the headland of Mistakodden. At the southern part of Barents\u00f8ya are the mountains of Krefftberget and H\u00f8grinden, while Jeppeberget is located to the southeast. The largest lakes of the island are Veslemj\u00f8sa in Heimarka, and Dalskilvatnet between the valleys of Sjodalen and Grimdalen.
