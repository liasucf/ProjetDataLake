She is said to have coined the phrase \"pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter\".Chlo\u00e9: A 60-Year Tradition of Pretty Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter . Lauren Cochrane. The Guardian, 2 October 2012. ==Career== Born in Alexandria, Egypt, the daughter of a cigarette factory manager, she met her husband, Raymond Aghion (1921\u20132009), when both were seven years old in elementary school. He was born into a wealthy family of cotton exporters, but displayed early stirrings of the social consciousness that would later land him in political exile. Gaby and Raymond, both Jewish, married at the age of 19. The couple moved to Paris in 1945. In Paris the Aghions gravitated toward the Communists, becoming close to writers Louis Aragon, Paul \u00c9luard and Tristan Tzara. Gaby launched Chlo\u00e9 in 1952. Raymond opened an art gallery in 1956, specializing in modern art. According to the website of Chlo\u00e9, Aghion rejected the stiff formality of 1950s fashion and created soft, feminine, body conscious clothes from fine fabrics, and called them \"luxury pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter\". Unique for their time, they were beautifully made clothes available off the rack. She set up her workshop in a maid's room above her large flat. In 1953, Gaby Aghion joined forces with Jacques Lenoir \u2013 he ran the business side and she ran the creative side. The duo put on the first Chlo\u00e9 show in 1956 at a breakfast at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore, the epicentre of young intellectual Parisians of the 1940s and 1950s. Aghion, later retired from the public eye, said: \"Everything was yet to be invented, and this thrilled me.\" Aghion hired Karl Lagerfeld early in his career, and other emerging fashion designers.Chlo\u00e9 at 60: the story of a fashion legend. The Guardian, 2 October 2012. Her son, Philippe, recalls Lagerfeld coming to the company in the mid-1960s: \"When he arrived from [the house of] Jean Patou, Karl was a shy individual. He and my mother made a fantastic team. He came into the spirit of Chlo\u00e9.\"Then And Now. Gaby Aghion founder and Clare Waight Keller designer of Chloe SA. Diderich, Joelle.
