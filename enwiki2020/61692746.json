    "text": "Paul McCartney has the most top-ten albums on the UK Albums Chart to date (61), among these are 32 as part of The Beatles and eight more with Wings. His most recent entry is solo recording Egypt Station from 2018. The UK Album Chart is a weekly record chart which for most of its history was based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom. Since July 2014 it has also incorporated streaming data, and from 10 July 2015 has been based on a Friday to Thursday week. The chart was founded in 1956 and began with just a top 5 being unveiled; this was extended to a top 10 from November 1958 onwards. The first album to top the chart was Songs for Swingin' Lovers! by Frank Sinatra. The sources, in accordance with the official canon of the Official Charts Company, are the Melody Maker chart from 1956 to 1960; the Record Retailer chart from 1960 to 1969; and the Official UK Albums Chart from 1969 onwards. This list shows the artists who have had the most top-ten albums on the UK Albums Chart, as of 5 September 2019 (week ending). Paul McCartney holds the record for most top 10 albums with 61, having first entered the chart in Please Please Me as part of The Beatles. His most recent entry was in 2018, the solo album Egypt Station. Elvis Presley is in second place. McCartney's bandmate, the late John Lennon, has the third most entries of all time in the top 10. Albums by \"Various Artists\" are excluded from this list because they all feature different acts under that banner. Yet again Depeche Mode missed out on the list with 17 top 10 UK albums.

Michael Jackson. Robbie Williams. Kylie Minogue.
