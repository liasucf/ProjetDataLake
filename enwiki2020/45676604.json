Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times described it as \"a dreary, dirty- talking sex comedy from the you've-got-to-be-kidding-me school of filmmaking\". Michael Nordine of LA Weekly wrote, \"Though Nipples and Palm Trees isn't without its eventual charms, the film is too content, for too long, to dwell on unfunny sleaze and thinly-sketched characters.\" HorrorCultFilms rated it 8/10 stars and called it \"quite possibly the biggest surprise of the year\". == References == == External links == * * * Category:2012 films Category:2010s sex comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American sex comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:2012 comedy films ",
