    "text": "Maximiliano \"Maxi\" Gast\u00f3n L\u00f3pez (born 3 April 1984) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward. He currently plays for Italian club Sambenedettese. L\u00f3pez holds both an Argentine and an Italian passport. He is known as El Rubio (\"The Blonde\"), and La Gallina de Oro (\"The Golden Hen\"). ==Club career== ===River Plate=== L\u00f3pez began his career in 1997 with River Plate. On 19 August 2001, at age 17, he made his senior debut, against Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba. That same season, he was officially promoted to the senior squad following five years with the youth program. With River Plate, he was a standout striker and the club won the Torneo Clausura in 2002, 2003 and 2004. L\u00f3pez remained with the club until his transfer to Spanish giants Barcelona in January 2005. With River Plate, he made 56 appearances, scoring 13 goals. ===Barcelona=== In January 2005, Barcelona signed L\u00f3pez for \u20ac6.2 million following an injury to striker Henrik Larsson. On his UEFA Champions League debut on 23 February 2005, he came on as a second-half substitute for Ludovic Giuly and within four minutes beat Chelsea defender William Gallas to score an equalizer with his first shot for the club, an eventual 2\u20131 first-leg win. His only other goal for the club came in a Copa del Rey tie against Zamora on 11 January 2006. L\u00f3pez failed to break into the club's first team; in his first season in La Liga, he made just 13 league appearances. ===Mallorca, Moscow and Gr\u00eamio=== L\u00f3pez transferred to Mallorca on loan for the 2006\u201307 season, scoring 3 goals in 25 matches, and returned to Barcelona in the summer of 2007, only to be sold to FC Moscow on 16 August 2007 after a \u20ac2 million transfer fee was agreed by the clubs. With Moscow, L\u00f3pez made 22 league appearances and scored 9 goals. On 13 February 2009, Brazilian club Gr\u00eamio signed L\u00f3pez on a season-long loan. He made his debut the following month in a game against Santa Cruz. His first goal for the club came against S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9-PA on 18 March 2009. On 24 June 2009, L\u00f3pez was accused of racism by Cruzeiro player Elicarlos in the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores. L\u00f3pez denied the charge and, so far, nothing has been proven. L\u00f3pez scored four goals in the 2009 Copa Libertadores and the winner in the centenary Gre-Nal derby match. He was scouted as a transfer target by several European clubs, including Catania, Chievo, Genoa and VfL Wolfsburg. ===Catania=== L\u00f3pez with Catania in 2011 On 20 January 2010, L\u00f3pez transferred to Catania for a \u20ac3 million transfer fee, signing a contract lasting until 30 June 2013. He made his Serie A debut on 31 January, [24] playing 55 minutes in the match against the Udinese. In the next match, away to Lazio (0\u20131), he scored his first goal and the match-winner for the Rossazzurri. On 3 April, he scored his first brace in the Italian top flight during the Sicilian derby against Palermo. He closed the season in double figures, scoring 11 goals in 17 appearances and contributed to the safety of the Etnei in Serie A. The following season, L\u00f3pez scored his first goal in a 2\u20130 home victory against Cesena on 22 September 2010. At the end of the season, he had scored 8 goals in 35 appearances, finishing 12th in the Serie A table with Catania. In the 2011\u201312 season, L\u00f3pez scored his first goal on 18 September 2011, converting a penalty against Cesena. On 18 December 2011, in the match won 2\u20130 by Catania against Palermo, he converted his second penalty of the season and was tearfully substituted by Gonzalo Bergessio for a possible farewell before the winter session of the transfer window. ====Milan (loan)==== On 27 January 2012, L\u00f3pez was officially transferred to Milan in a \u20ac1.5 million loan move, with a buying option set at \u20ac8 million. He signed a contract with Milan until 30 June 2015 to receive \u20ac700,000 until the end of the 2011\u201312 season and \u20ac1.5 million per year for the following three seasons. He chose the number 21 shirt. L\u00f3pez scored his first goal as a Milan player on 11 February 2012 in an away game against Udinese, equalising for Milan before going on to assist Stephan El Shaarawy to score the game-winning goal. However, at the end of the season, he returned to Catania after Milan opted not to exercise their buying option. ====Sampdoria (loan)==== On 11 July, L\u00f3pez joined Sampdoria on a season-long loan deal from Catania.Sampdoria snap up Lopez on loan; ESPN Soccernet, 11 July 2012. Retrieved on 12 July 2012. L\u00f3pez returned to Catania from a loan spell for the duration of the 2013\u201314 season and on 28 January 2014, he rejoined Sampdoria on loan for the remainder of the Serie A campaign. He scored a winning goal in his first match back for Sampdoria against Genoa on 3 February 2014. ===Chievo=== On 30 June 2014, L\u00f3pez signed a one-year deal with Chievo with an option to extend his contract for a further year after Catania relegation. He made his debut on the first day of the 2014\u201315 Serie A season, 30 August, against Juventus, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1-0 home loss. In his second match, on 14 September, he scored the only goal as Chievo defeated Napoli. ===Torino=== On 13 January 2015, L\u00f3pez joined Torino, signing a six- month contract with an option for another year. He debuted the next day against Lazio in the second round of the Coppa Italia. On 18 January, he scored his first goal for Torino, against Cesena in a 3\u20132 Torino victory. On 19 February, he scored a brace during the UEFA Europa League round of 32 against Athletic Bilbao, therefore managing to score in five different leagues (Argentine, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian and Italian) and in all international competitions (Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana, Champions League and Europa League). He scored again in the victorious return leg in Spain seven days later, then the 28th round of the league away at Parma. On 17 May, he scored his first brace for Torino in Serie A in the 2\u20130 victory over his former club Chievo. After renewing for another year, on 24 November 2015 L\u00f3pez signed a new contract with Torino lasting until 2018. ===Vasco de Gama=== On 14 July 2018, L\u00f3pez joined Vasco da Gama, signing an eighteen-month contract with an option for another year. He debuted against S\u00e3o Paulo. On 27 August, he scored his first goal for Vasco against Chapecoense in a 3\u20131 Vasco victory and also had two assists, winning man of the match honors. After 14 matches he had great displays, with 7 goals and 6 assists, being considered the best Vasco player in the second semester and becoming the supporters favorite. ===Crotone=== On 23 August 2019, L\u00f3pez return to Italy in Serie B club Crotone for free. He signed a one year contract. ===Sambenedettese=== On 10 August 2020, he signed a one-year contract with Serie C club Sambenedettese. ==International career== L\u00f3pez represented his birth nation of Argentina at under-15, under-17 and under-20 levels, also taking part to the 2003 South American Youth Championship. He is currently eligible for both Argentina and Italy, as he holds both citizenships and has never represented any national team at senior level. In July 2010, he explicitly stated he might accept a call-up from the Azzurri. ==Personal life== L\u00f3pez was married to Argentine model Wanda Nara from 2008 to 2013. The couple have three sons, Valentino Gast\u00f3n (born 25 January 2009), Constantino (born 19 December 2010) and Benedicto (born 20 February 2012). Nara and L\u00f3pez split after her affair with L\u00f3pez's former Sampdoria teammate Mauro Icardi, now with Paris Saint-Germain, was exposed. L\u00f3pez had previously been good friends with Icardi, inviting his countryman on vacations and opening his home to Icardi when he first moved to Italy. She and L\u00f3pez began divorce proceedings in December 2013. Nara and Icardi subsequently married on 27 May 2014. During the April 2014 Serie A match between Sampdoria and Inter, L\u00f3pez notably refused to shake Icardi's hand, leading the press to dub the game the \"Wanda derby\". L\u00f3pez is also close friends with global superstar Lionel Messi, as L\u00f3pez was signed by Barcelona while Messi was establishing himself in the first team. Living thousands of miles away from home at a young age, Messi bonded with Maxi as fellow Argentines, with L\u00f3pez acting as a big brother to Messi during the latter's rise to stardom. It has long been rumored that this friendship has kept Icardi from playing international football despite his strong performances for Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. L\u00f3pez's change of luck from being a somewhat criticised forward at River Plate to being signed by Barcelona made him an internet meme in his native Argentina. Satirical blogs were created lobbying for his inclusion in the Argentinian squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. After the Argentinian elimination from the World Cup, without L\u00f3pez getting any caps at all, the nature of the meme changed to a series of reasons explaining his lack of time play on Barcelona with hyperbolic claims which closely resembled Chuck Norris Facts. In interviews, L\u00f3pez has stated that he is \"okay\" with this unexpected following. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|River Plate |2001\u201302 |17||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||1 |- |2002\u201303 |6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||1 |- |2003\u201304 |17||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||7 |- |2004\u201305 |16||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||7 |- !Total !56!!13!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!14!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!70!!16 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Barcelona |2004\u201305 |8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||1 |- |2005\u201306 |6||0||2||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||1 |- !Total !14!!0!!2!!1!!3!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!19!!2 |- |Mallorca (loan) |2006\u201307 |29||3||2||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||5 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|FC Moscow |2007 |9||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||6 |- |2008 |13||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||3 |- !Total !22!!9!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!23!!9 |- |Gr\u00eamio (loan) |2009 |25||12||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||4||7||1||41||17 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Catania |2009\u201310 |17||11||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||11 |- |2010\u201311 |35||8||2||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||10 |- |2011\u201312 |14||3||2||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||5 |- |2013\u201314 |12||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||1 |- !Total !78!!23!!5!!4!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!83!!27 |- |Milan (loan) |2011\u201312 |8||1||2||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||2 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Sampdoria (loan) |2012\u201313 |17||4||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||5 |- |2013\u201314 |11||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||1 |- !Total !28!!5!!1!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!29!!6 |- |Chievo |2014\u201315 |13||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Torino |2014\u201315 |18||8||1||0||4||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||23||11 |- |2015\u201316 |26||4||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||29||6 |- |2016\u201317 |16||2||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||3 |- !Total !60!!14!!6!!3!!4!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!70!!20 |- |Udinese |2017\u201318 |28||2||1||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||29||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !361!!83!!20!!16!!32!!11!!7!!1!!420!!111 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== River Plate *Torneo Clausura (3): 2001\u201302, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304 Barcelona * La Liga (2): 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306 * Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2005 * UEFA Champions League: 2005\u201306 Vasco da Gama * Ta\u00e7a Guanabara: 2019 ===Individual=== *Coppa Italia: Top Goalscorer 2017\u201318 (4 goals) ==References== ==External links== * European Champions Cup/UEFA Champions League Winning Squads * *Profile and statistics at FootballDatabase *Guardian statistics *Maxi L\u00f3pez \u2013 Argentine Primera statistics at F\u00fatbol XXI Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate footballers Category:FC Barcelona players Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:FC Moscow players Category:Gr\u00eamio Foot- Ball Porto Alegrense players Category:Calcio Catania players Category:A.C.
