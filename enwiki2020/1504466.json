    "text": "Melody \"Mary Mack\" (\"Miss Mary Mack\") is a clapping game played by children in English-speaking countries. It is first attested in the book The Counting Out Rhymes of Children by Henry Carrington Bolton (1888), whose version was collected in West Chester, Pennsylvania. It is well known in various parts of the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and in New Zealand and has been called \"the most common hand-clapping game in the English-speaking world\". In the game, two children stand or sit opposite to each other, and clap hands in time to a rhyming song. The same song is also used as a jumprope rhyme,Gaunt, Games Black Girls Play, p. 68 although rarely so according to one source. ==Rhyme== Various versions of the song exist; a common version goes; :Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack :All dressed in black, black, black :With silver buttons, buttons, buttons :All down her back, back, back. (or \"Up and down her back back back\") :She asked her mother, mother, mother :For 50 cents, cents, cents :To see the elephants, elephants, elephants :Who jumped the fence, fence, fence :They jumped so high, high, high :they reached the sky, sky, sky :And didn't (or never) come back, back, back :Till the 4th of July ly ly. :She asked her mother, mother, mother :For 50 cents more, more, more :To see the elephants, elephants, elephants They the floor floor floor :They jumped to the flow flow flow :they stubbed their toe toe toe :and that was the end end end :of the elephant show show show. An alternate version, sung in Canada, includes the words: :She could not read, read, read :She could not write, write, write :But she could smoke, smoke, smoke :Her father\u2019s pipe, pipe, pipe. An alternate version, sung in the American South: :Mary Mack, :dressed in black, :silver buttons all down her back. :She combed her hair :and broke the comb :She's gonna get a whoopin' when her Momma comes home :Gonna get a whoopin' when her Momma comes home ==Clap== A common version of the accompanying clap is as follows: *&: Arms across chest *4: Pat thighs *&: Clap hands *1: Clap right palms with partner *&: Clap left palms with partner *2: Clap both palms with partner Another version:Bernstein, Sara (1994). Hand Clap!, p.88-9. . Rhythm not provided. *&: One palm up, one palm down *4: Clap both partners hands *&: Clap own hands *1: Cross arms to chest *2: Slap thighs *3: Clap own hands Another Version: *4: Pat thighs *&: Clap hands *1: Clap partners right hand *&: Clap hands *&: Clap partners left hand *&: Clap hands *2: Clap both partners hands *&: Clap hands Another Version: *&: One palm up, one palm down *1: Clap both partners hands *&: Reverse hands *2: Clap both partners hands *&: Clap own hands *4: clap partners right hand *&: clap hands *5: clap partners left hand *&: clap hands *6: clap partners right hand *&: clap hands repeat ==Possible origins== The first verse, the repetition, is also a riddle with the answer \"coffin\". Early mentions of the part about the elephant do not include the part about Mary Mack. ===Merrimack=== The origin of the name Mary Mack is obscure, and various theories have been proposed. According to one theory, Mary Mack originally referred to the USS Merrimack, a United States warship of the mid-1800s named after the Merrimack River, that would have been black, with silvery rivets. This may suggest that the first verse refers to the Battle of Hampton Roads during the American Civil War. ===See also=== *\"Walking The Dog\", a 1960s R&B; song by Rufus Thomas with lyrics based on \"Mary Mack\". *\"Witchcraft (Book of Love song)\", a song from the Pop group, Book of Love, with a reference to \"Mary Mack\". *\"Tobacco Origin Story\", a poem by Joy Harjo, refers to the song twice in a prominent way. ==References== Category:American folk songs Category:English children's songs Category:Traditional children's songs Category:Songs about fictional female characters Category:Clapping games Category:Skipping rhymes ",
