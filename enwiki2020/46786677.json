    "text": "The International Design Awards are a group of awards that recognize, celebrate and promote design visionaries and emerging talent in architecture, interior, product, graphic and fashion design. ==History== A handful of designers, thinkers and entrepreneurs created the International Design Awards in 2007 as a response to the lack of recognition and celebration for smart and sustainable multidisciplinary design. The International Design Awards were developed by Farmani Group. Recipients of Designer of the Year or Emerging Designer of the Year are awarded by invitation to the biannual International Design Awards gala in Los Angeles, a press campaign including links to their website reaching over 100,000 design professionals, press and potential clients, inclusion in the International Design Awards Design Directory and their Gallery of Winning Work, a feature in the International Design Awards Book of Designs, which is distributed to museums and design bookstores internationally, an International Design Awards Certificate of Achievements and permission to use the International Design Awards Winner's Seal on their website and printed materials. Farmani Group assembled IDA as the design sibling of the Annual Lucie Awards for Photography. == Honorees == ===2007=== Designer of the Year: *Architect of the Year - Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP - Al-Rajhi Bank Headquarters *Fashion Design of the Year - JC Obando - Fall 2007 *Graphic Design of the Year \u2013 Volume Inc. - SFMOMA Poster *Interior Design of the Year \u2013 Ministry of Design \u2013 SHO U *Product Design of the Year \u2013 Humanscale Design Studio \u2013 T5 Emerging Designer of the Year: *Architect of the Year \u2013 Orangelabs Studio \u2013 Biomedical Research Institute *Graphic Design of the Year \u2013 Student \u2013 Symbols to Cultivate Change *Interior Design of the Year \u2013 Timothy Schreiber \u2013 Evolution_Table *Product Design of the Year \u2013 Pratt Institute \u2013 The Min.
