    "text": "The M\u00e9daille militaire () is a military decoration of the French Republic for other ranks for meritorious service and acts of bravery in action against an enemy force. It is the third highest award of the French Republic, after the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, a civil and military order, and the ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration, a Second World War-only order. The M\u00e9daille militaire is therefore the most senior entirely military active French decoration. During World War One, 230,000 m\u00e9dailles were awarded,historique de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'entraide des m\u00e9daill\u00e9s militaires when 1 400 000 French Army soldiers were killed and 3,000,000 wounded. For comparison, the UK Military Medal was awarded on 115,000 occasions in World War One, when 673,375 British Army soldiers were killed and 1,643,469 wounded. The award was first established in 1852 by the first President of the French Republic, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte who may have taken his inspiration from a medal established and awarded by his father, Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland. After the First World War, the Military Medal was also temporarily awarded for wounds received in combat. ==Statute== Like many other French awards, the m\u00e9daille can be awarded for different reasons. It can be awarded to foreign nationals serving with or alongside the French armed forces. * To members of the military other than commissioned officers (including enlisted ranks, non-commissioned officers and aspirants or Officer Designate). ** As an award for valour, it is the second highest award ranking immediately after the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. ** As an in between medal for enlisted members, NCO and O(D) awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur for \"combat actions\", nowadays mostly done posthumously. ** As a service medal, for long- serving NCOs. * To generals and admirals who have been commanders-in-chief, as a supreme award for leadership. These general officers must already have been awarded the grand cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. ==Award description== The M\u00e9daille militaire is a silver laurel wreath, in diameter, wrapped around a central gold medallion bearing the left profile of Marianne, effigy of the French Republic, the original 2nd Empire variant bore the left profile of Emperor Napoleon III. The central gold medallion is surrounded by a blue enamelled ring bearing the gilt inscription \"R\u00c9PUBLIQUE FRAN\u00c7AISE\" () with a small gilt five-pointed star at the bottom for a 4th Republic award, three stars for a 5th Republic variant, the 3rd Republic variant bore the date 1870, the 2nd Empire variant bore the gilt inscription \"LOUIS-NAPOLEON\" in lieu of \"R\u00c9PUBLIQUE FRAN\u00c7AISE\" and had flowers on both sides of the small star at the bottom. The original variant was topped by a silver imperial eagle with a loop through which the suspension ring passed, all other variants were and are topped by a device composed of a breastplate superimposed over crossed cannons, a naval anchor, sabres, swords and battle axes, to which the suspension ring passes through a loop for attachment to a ribbon. The reverse of the medallion is common to all variants since inception of the award, it bears the relief inscription on three lines \"VALEUR ET DISCIPLINE\" () and is surrounded by a blue enamelled ring. The ribbon of the M\u00e9daille militaire is wide, yellow in color with green stripes on each edge. This ribbon was borrowed from the Order of the Iron Crown which it effectively replaced in France. {| align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2nd Empire 1852\u20131870 ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 3rd Republic 1870\u20131940 ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 4th Republic 1946\u20131958 ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 5th Republic 1958\u2013present ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Reverse common to all variants |- | align=\"center\" | 150px | align=\"center\" | 145px | align=\"center\" | 150px | align=\"center\" | 142px | align=\"center\" | 149px |} == Recipients == Field Marshal Montgomery, a recipient of the M\u00e9daille militaire WW1 African American fighter pilot Eugene Bullard, a recipient of the M\u00e9daille militaire Marshal of France, Great Britain and Poland, Ferdinand Foch, a recipient of the M\u00e9daille militaire The M\u00e9daille militaire was awarded in some number to British and allied forces (allies of the French Empire) during the Crimean War of 1854-56 and in reasonably large numbers to allied forces in the 1914-18 war. During the Second World War, the M\u00e9daille reached its highest numbers of foreign bestowals, most often to members of the British Army as well as to the United States military. The general's m\u00e9daille was awarded to Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito, as supreme commanders of the UK, US and Yugoslav military forces, but to also effective military leaders, such as General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, and to Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope. ==Unit award== In addition to the individual medal, the M\u00e9daille militaire is also authorized as a unit award to those military commands who display the same criteria of bravery as would be required for the individual medal. The m\u00e9daille is displayed on the flag of these units. It is one of the rarest unit awards in the French military. This unit award should not be confused with the fourrag\u00e8re de la m\u00e9daille militaire, which is a cord suspended from the shoulder of a military uniform worn by members of units which had been mentioned in despatches. A fourrag\u00e8re aux couleurs du ruban de la m\u00e9daille militaire (fourrag\u00e8re in the colours of the ribbon of the m\u00e9daille militaire) is worn by units which had been mentioned four times, a fourrag\u00e8re aux couleurs de la l\u00e9gion d'honneur et de la m\u00e9daille militaire (fourrag\u00e8re in the colours of the ribbons of the l\u00e9gion d'honneur and the m\u00e9daille militaire) for units mentioned twelve times.
