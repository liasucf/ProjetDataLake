Early on in his time with the club he made two appearances as they were then in the second division during the 2002-03 season. However, following the bankruptcy of Lausanne-Sport the following season, Pimenta joined BSC Young Boys. After initially playing with the side's academy team, he would go on to feature for the reserves but a lack of goals kept him from maintaining a place in the squad. This prompted the player to seek more playing time elsewhere on loan, joining Portuguese club C.F. Uni\u00e3o de Coimbra then playing in the fourth-tier. Following a stay of a year and a half there, he returned to Switzerland and left Young Boys for FC Biel-Bienne where he remained for only six months. He then joined FC Baulmes of the third division where he managed an impressive 14 goals in nine matches which drew the attention of his former club FC Lausanne-Sport, now back in the Swiss Challenge League, transferring in the latter part of the 2008-09 season. The highlight of his time during his second stint with Lausanne came as helped the club in their run to the 2010 Swiss Cup final, along the way scoring in the quarter-finals against his former team BSC Young Boys, although they would go to lose to FC Basel in the end. Released at the end of the season, Pimenta would go on to claim a succession of one year contracts with several clubs including FC Stade Nyonnais, FC Lugano, and FC Chiasso. In the summer of 2013, the player rejoined FC Lausanne-Sport for a third time although as the club currently play in the Swiss Super League he will finally get his chance to feature in Switzerland's top division. ==References== ==External links== * Player page on World Football Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Portuguese expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Lausanne-Sport players Category:FC Biel-Bienne players Category:FC Stade Nyonnais players Category:FC Lugano players Category:FC Chiasso players Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Swiss Challenge League players ",
