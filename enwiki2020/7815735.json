    "text": "Eljero George Rinaldo Elia (; born 13 February 1987) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a winger for Eredivisie club Utrecht and the Netherlands national team. He turned professional at ADO Den Haag and then played for Twente before moving abroad to represent Hamburger SV, Juventus and Werder Bremen. In 2015, he came back to his home country to play for Feyenoord before moving to \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, in 2017. Elia scored on his debut for the Netherlands national team in September 2009 and was part of the Dutch squad which reached the final at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Leidschendam-Voorburg, Elia played as a youth for local sides SV Voorburg, Forum Sport and TONEGIDO. In 1996, at age nine, he moved to the youth system of ADO Den Haag. ===ADO Den Haag=== Elia made his professional debut on 23 January 2005 against Groningen at age 17. In that season, he played four matches and scored his first professional goal in a match against AZ on 8 May. Elia soon established himself in the starting lineup at ADO Den Haag. After some conflicts between Elia and ADO's new coach, Lex Schoenmaker, Twente signed him in 2007. Elia with Twente in 2008 ===Twente=== Besides Twente, Ajax were also keen to sign Elia. However, had he chosen Ajax, he would have initially been sent on loan to ADO Den Haag, where he had left after disagreements with their head coach, Schoenmaker. Furthermore, ADO had suffered relegation in the meantime and Elia did not want to play in the Eerste Divisie. Elia made his debut for Twente in a 2\u20132 draw against Utrecht on 26 August 2007. He scored his first goal in a 2\u20131 win over Heracles Almelo on 8 February 2008, and scored another goal in a 2\u20131 win over Ajax the following month. In his first season at the club, Elia made 30 appearances and scored twice in the league. Under new manager Steve McClaren, Elia improved and went on a goalscoring run with 11 goals. He made his European debut in the third qualifying round of the Champions League against English club Arsenal, where Twente lost in both legs. Despite the club's elimination from the tournament, they progressed to the UEFA Cup group stage, where Elia scored his first European goal in a 2\u20133 loss to Manchester City on 6 November 2008. After advancing from the group, Twente lost over two legs in the round of 32 against Marseille after penalties. In the Dutch Cup, Twente progressed to the final against Heerenveen, where Elia scored the opener, which would not be enough as Twente lost on penalties after Youssouf Hersi missed the decisive kick. Nonetheless, Elia was named the Dutch Football Talent of the Year for 2009, adding to his burgeoning reputation as an emerging talent in Europe. In the January transfer window, Ajax and PSV were linked with a move to sign Elia after his breakout season for Twente. Ajax had their bid rejected twice by the club in their efforts to sign Elia. Elia ended all speculation by signing a five-year contract extension Twente, keeping him at the club until 2013. However, two months after signing a new contract, Elia announced his intention to leave the club at the end of the season. ===Hamburger SV=== Elia pictured taken on 25 July 2012. On 5 July 2009, Elia joined Hamburger SV on a five-year contract that cost \u20ac8.5 million. On 8 August 2009, he made his debut as a substitute in the first match of the season against SC Freiburg. He scored his first league debut goal in a 4\u20132 win over VfL Wolfsburg on 23 August 2009. Five months later, he scored a brace and set up a goal in a 4\u20130 win over 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. Elia scored his first Europa League goal in a 4\u20132 win over Hapoel Tel Aviv on 1 October 2009. In a 1\u20131 draw at Mainz 05 on 28 November 2009, Elia suffered an ankle injury in the 15th minute. He missed the rest of the season following an ankle surgery, which manager Bruno Labbadia described as a \"bitter blow\". During his first season, in March 2010, Elia had a severe infection due to a poorly applied tattoo, which meant he felt uncomfortable in his shirt. As a result, Hamburg's neighbours Werder Bremen have since banned their players from getting tattoos.https://www.thelocal.de/20110712/36229 In his debut season, Elia made 24 appearances and scored five goals. At the end of the season, Elia was linked with several clubs such as Juventus, but insisted he knew nothing about a move and wanted to stay at Hamburg for another season. In his second season, Elia was rotated and played less frequently, which led him to consider leaving the club if he did not regain his starting position. In his third season, Elia made four appearances before moving to Juventus. ===Juventus=== On 31 August 2011, Juventus confirmed the signing of Elia from Hamburg on a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac9 million. Elia made his Juventus debut on 25 September 2011 in a 1\u20131 draw against Catania. Elia, however, found it hard to make an impact in the black and white shirt and featured only four times in the whole season. Despite Juventus winning the Serie A title without losing a game, Elia announced he wanted to leave the club in order to revive his career elsewhere. The following month, on 11 June 2012, Elia handed in a transfer request which was granted by Juventus. ===Werder Bremen=== On 9 July 2012, Werder Bremen confirmed the signing of Elia from Juventus on a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac5.5 million. After moving to Bremen, Elia said he hoped that he could resurrect his form and aimed to earn an international call-up. He appeared in his first game for Bremen in a 2\u20131 loss in the opening game of the season against Borussia Dortmund. After making seven appearances with no goals, Elia admitted he found it difficult to adapt to the club's playing style. Despite this, he made 25 total appearances for the club that season, in which he scored one goal. In the 2013\u201314 season, Elia started strongly when he scored two goals and his first for Bremen against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg in a 3-3 draw on 29 September 2013. He then scored two goals in two matches against Mainz 05 on 24 November 2013, when Bremen lost 3\u20132, and in a 4\u20134 draw against 1899 Hoffenheim on 30 November 2013. The 2013\u201314 season was an improvement for Elia, as he made 33 appearances and scored four times. His improvement led the club to decide against selling him. In the 2014\u201315 season, Elia made a good start in the opening game of the season, where he provided an assist for Franco Di Santo in a 2\u20132 draw against Hertha BSC. Elia's season, however, was interrupted when he missed a game due to gastrointestinal virus. In December 2014, manager Viktor Skrypnyk decided to drop Elia from the first team matchday squad. Upon returning to his parent club from Southampton in the summer of 2015, Werder exempted Elia from regular first-team training to find a new club and also considered placing him into the club's reserve. ====Southampton (loan)==== On 23 December 2014, Southampton announced that Elia would join them on loan from 3 January 2015 for the remainder of the season, with an option to make the loan permanent at the end of the season. On 11 January 2015, Elia made his Premier League debut for Southampton in a 1\u20130 win away to Manchester United at Old Trafford; he was replaced by substitute Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 after 63 minutes, who went on to score the winning goal. Elia scored his first Premier League goals with a brace in a 2\u20131 victory at Newcastle United on 17 January. After making 13 appearances and scoring twice, Elia was keen to stay at the club permanently,{https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/12943577.eljero-elia-hopes- that-he-can-make-his-loan-switch-from-werder-bremen-to-southampton-permanent- this-summer/ with Werder Bremen's chief director claiming Southampton wanted to sign him. ===Feyenoord=== On 6 August 2015, Elia signed a two-year-deal with Dutch side Feyenoord under the management of former Arsenal player Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Elia made his debut for the club on 30 August in a 3\u20131 loss to rivals PSV. In 2016, Elia, playing as a starting regular for the Rotterdam-based outfit, won the KNVB Cup, the club's 12th title. On 7 March 2016, Elia was brought in for questioning and arrested for his alleged involvement in a brawl in the Rotterdam city centre the week before. The following season with Feyenoord, Elia won the Eredivisie title of 2017. === \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir === On 13 June 2017, he joined Turkish side \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir on a three-year contract. He made his debut for the club on 26 July in a 3-3 away draw against Club Brugge in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, immediately scoring his first goal in the 62nd minute of the match. His first appearance in the S\u00fcper Lig came on 11 August in a 1-0 home win over Bursaspor, where he scored the only goal of the match. In the 2019\u201320 season, Elia won the S\u00fcper Lig with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir. His contract with the club expired after the season, making him a free agent. === Utrecht === On 19 August 2020, Elia signed a two-year contract with FC Utrecht, after coming over from \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir on a free transfer. He made his first appearance for the club in a 1\u20131 away draw in the Eredivisie against VVV-Venlo, where he came on as a substitute in the 81st minute. ==International career== Elia first appeared for the Netherlands national under-19 team in 2005, a year after his debut as a professional. He developed rapidly and at the beginning of 2006, he was selected for the U21 side. He was selected by coach Bert van Marwijk for the senior team's friendly encounter with England. On 6 September 2009, Elia made his debut for the Netherlands against Japan in a friendly match. He came on at half-time replacing Arjen Robben. His first match for the Oranje went very well, and he produced two assists in a 3\u20130 victory. In his second match, on 9 September 2009, Elia scored the only goal to win a match against Scotland. He scored his second international goal in a 6\u20131 friendly win over Hungary with a solo effort after coming on as a substitute. Elia with the Dutch national team in 2010 ===2010 World Cup=== On 27 May 2010, Dutch manager Bert van Marwijk announced that Elia would be part of the 23-man final squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the first match, he set up their second goal in a 2\u20130 win over Denmark, with his shot hitting the post and Dirk Kuyt tapping it in. In Durban, during the Netherlands' second match of the group stage, Elia came on as a substitute in the 72nd minute, after the Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima fumbled a powerful effort by Wesley Sneijder into the back of the net to give the Dutch a 1\u20130 lead after 53 minutes. In the 66th minute of the Netherlands' final group stage match against Cameroon, Elia came on as a substitute for Kuyt. In the final, Elia was a 71st-minute substitute for Kuyt, as Netherlands finished runners-up to Spain. ==Personal life== Elia's first name is an homage to his sister's favourite jazz singer, Al Jarreau. As a child, he idolised Romario. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup1 !colspan=\"2\"|Continental2 !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"4\" |ADO Den Haag |2004\u201305 | rowspan=\"3\" |Eredivisie |4||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||1 |- |2005\u201306 |30||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||2 |- |2006\u201307 |25||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||3 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !59 !6 !1 !0 ! ! !60 !6 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Twente |2007\u201308 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |30||2||0||0||6||0||36||2 |- |2008\u201309 |34||9||5||4||8||1||47||14 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !64!!11!!5!!4!!14!!1!!83!!16 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Hamburger SV |2009\u201310 | rowspan=\"3\" |Bundesliga |24||5||1||0||10||1||35||6 |- |2010\u201311 |24||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||2 |- |2011\u201312 |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !52!!7!!3!!0!!10!!1!!65!!8 |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Juventus |2011\u201312 |Serie A |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !4!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!5!!0 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Werder Bremen |2012\u201313 | rowspan=\"3\" |Bundesliga |24||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||1 |- |2013\u201314 |33||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||4 |- |2014\u201315 |9||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !66!!4!!2!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!68!!5 |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Southampton (loan) |2014\u201315 |Premier League |16||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||2 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !16!!2!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!17!!2 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Feyenoord |2015\u201316 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |31||8||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||8 |- |2016\u201317 |24||9||4||1||3||0||31||10 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !55!!17!!10!!1!!3!!0!!68!!18 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |\u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"3\" |S\u00fcper Lig |24||5||0||0||8||3||32||8 |- |2018\u201319 |21||1||2||0||1||0||24||1 |- |2019\u201320 |22||3||0||0||5||0||27||3 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !67!!9!!2!!0!!14!!3!!83!!12 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Career total !383!!56!!25!!6!!40!!5!!444!!67 |} 1 Includes appearances in the KNVB Cup, DFB-Pokal, Coppa Italia, FA Cup, and Turkish Cup. 1 Includes appearances in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. ===International goals=== :Updated to games played 27 March 2015. ==Honours== Juventus *Serie A: 2011\u201312 Feyenoord *Eredivisie: 2016\u201317 *KNVB Cup: 2015\u201316 \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir *S\u00fcper Lig: 2019\u201320 Netherlands *FIFA World Cup runners- up: 2010 Individual *Eredivisie Talent of the Year: 2008\u201309 *Bundesliga Goal of the Month: December 2009 ==References== ==External links== *Eljero Elia Voetbal International *Eljero Elia stats at Sky Sports *Eljero Elia at kicker.de * *Holland stats at OnsOranje Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Voorburg Category:Dutch people of Surinamese descent Category:Association football wingers Category:Dutch footballers Category:Netherlands international footballers Category:Netherlands under-21 international footballers Category:2010 FIFA World Cup players Category:ADO Den Haag players Category:FC Twente players Category:Hamburger SV players Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:SV Werder Bremen players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Feyenoord players Category:\u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir F.K. players Category:FC Utrecht players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Serie A players Category:Premier League players Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Turkey ",
