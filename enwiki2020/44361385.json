    "text": "Department distribution since 2008 French senators are elected by indirect universal suffrage, by a panel of \"electors\". Half of the Senate seats are up for election every three years; the term of office is six years. The last elections were held on September 24, 2017 for the series 1 and the September 28, 2014 for series 2. ==Third Republic== The law of on the organization of the Senate, the Senate created the Third Republic, required that the Senate be composed of 300 members, 225 elected by the departments and colonies and 75 elected by the National Assembly. These members were appointed for life. Some of them were still senators well after the law of no longer allowed senators to be appointed by the National Assembly. The last irremovable senator (inamovible in French) died in 1918. There were a total of 116 irremovable senators. ==Fifth Republic== In 2000, Parliament passed a law to move to a proportional list in the departments with three or more senators, and an increase in the number of delegates for large municipalities, but this measure was vetoed by the Constitutional Council because the Senate is to represent the local authorities. In 2003, the term of office changed from nine years to six years. Senators were no longer elected by thirds but by halves, and the two series are elected three years apart. The minimum age was reduced from 35 to 30 years, proportional representation began applying only to departments with four or more senators. In 2005, the term of office of all senators was extended for one year, to put the senate elections right after the municipal elections. In 2011, the minimum age for senators was decreased from 30 to 24 years. In 2012, Commission sur la r\u00e9novation et la d\u00e9ontologie de la vie publique (Committee on elections and ethics in public life) led by Lionel Jospin made several proposals to Parliament: ensure a fairer representation of local authorities in the Senate using a weighted vote of electors and removing deputies from the electoral college, extending the use of proportional representation for the election of senators and lowering to 18 the minimum age of eligibility the Senate. Only the extension of proportional representation to Departments of three senators or more and is retained, as well as increasing the number of delegates from the major cities in a law enacted in 2013. The mode of election of overseas senators is reformed. ==Current system== The number of elected senators in the departments is 326, the elected senators in other communes is 8 and there are 12 senators representing French outside France. Except where specified otherwise, this section describes only the method of electing senators for departments.

In addition, in the municipalities of over 30,000 inhabitants, municipal councils elect additional delegates at 1 for every 800 inhabitants in excess of 30,000. In practice, the additional delegates are often permanent, activists or supporters of political parties, employees of elected officials, relatives or friends. === In New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna === Senators are elected by an electoral college consisting of: * In New Caledonia: *# MPs; *# Members of Provincial Assemblies; *# Delegates of municipal councils or substitutes for these delegates. *In French Polynesia: *# MPs; *# Members of the Assembly of French Polynesia; *# municipal councilors or their substitutes. * In Wallis and Futuna: *# MPs; *# Members of the Territorial Assembly. === In Mayotte, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint-Martin and Saint Pierre and Miquelon === Senators are elected by an electoral college consisting of: * From the department of Mayotte: *# MPs; *# general councilors; *# municipal councilors or their alternates. * From St. Bartholomew: *# MPs; *# territorial councilors. * In St. Martin: *# MPs; *# territorial councilors. * In Saint Pierre and Miquelon: *# MPs; *# territorial councilors; *# municipal councilors or their alternates. === French expatriates === Since the law of 22 July 2013, senators representing French expatriates are elected by a panel formed from: # MPs elected by French expatriates; # Consular advisers; # Consular delegates.

Being an elector has the same conditions as being a Senator, except that the minimum age is 24 years. Any senate candidate must be a French national to run for these offices and \"No one can be elected if he has not satisfied the obligations imposed by the Code of National Service\" (translated), adults subject to guardianship or trusteeship are ineligible. The office of senator can not be combined with that of an MP, a member of the European Parliament, a member of the French government, a member of the Constitutional Council, or of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council. The office of Senator can not be combined with military service, or the exercise of more than one of the following offices: Regional Adviser, member of the Corsican Assembly, general councillor, councilor to Paris, or councillor of a town of at least 3500 inhabitants; the constitutional ombudsman and Comptroller General of prisons are ineligible during their term of office; Prefects of France are ineligible in any constituency included in whole or in part within the jurisdiction in which they hold or have held office for up to three years from the date of the poll (non exhaustive list). A draft organic law presented by the Cabinet on April 3, 2013 seeks to prohibit the accumulation of local executive functions with the office of Deputy or Senator starting March 31, 2017. === Organization of elections === In departments where threehttps://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/france/france.html or fewer senators are elected, the election is a majority vote in two rounds. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes cast and a number of votes equal to at least a quarter of registered voters. In the second ballot, a simple majority suffices. In case of a tie, the older candidate is elected. Each candidate runs with a replacement of different gender In departments where fourhttps://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/france/france.html or more senators are elected, the election takes place using proportional representation following the rule of the highest average, without panachage or preferential voting. On each list, seats are allocated to candidates based on their order in the list. Electors are required to vote, a fine of 100 Euro must be paid in the event of an unjustified abstention. Delegates who voted, and voters of law who do not receive compensation for their duties receive a travel allowance === Replacement of senators === Senators whose seat becomes vacant due to death, accepting a position with the government, the Constitutional Council or Defender, or the extension beyond the six months of a temporary mission entrusted by the government are replaced. If Senator was elected by a majority vote, the elected replacement takes his or her place. In the case of proportional representation, the first unelected candidate from the same list as the Senator is the replacement In case of cancellation of the elections, in the event of a vacancy other than those mentioned above, the procedure is to hold elections within three months. It is not, however, preceded by any election in the year before partial election of the Senate. == Notes == == References == Elections Senate ",
