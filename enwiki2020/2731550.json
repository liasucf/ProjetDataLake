The title derives from the classical Roman literary genre \"menippean satire\" which included a mixture of prose and verse. The work was written during the Etats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux which were convened by Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne (leader of the Catholic League) in Paris (on February 10, 1593) in the hopes of electing himself to the French throne (replacing the pretender to the throne, the future Henry IV of France). The work was conceived by Pierre le Roy (canon of Rouen and chaplain to the cardinal of Bourbon) during discussions with friends (\"fran\u00e7ais en politique et gallicans en religion\" or \"French in politics and Gallicans in religion\") in Paris at the home of Jacques Gillot (canon of the Sainte-Chapelle). The work was written by Nicolas Rapin, Jean Passerat and Florent Chrestien, and edited/revised by Pierre Pithou. The philosophy of the group around Pithou and Rapin and the Satire M\u00e9nipp\u00e9e is that of the \"Politiques\", moderate Catholics who privileged peace, conceived of a distinction between the State and Religion, and sought political accommodation with the Huguenots. By the end of the civil wars, the \"politiques\" were the favored target of attack of the Catholic League. The work includes several remarkable passages, including a description of a procession and all the forces of the League, the public orations of the Duke of Mayenne, of the legate of the Pope, and of the cardinals Pelv\u00e9 (attributed to Chrestien) and Aubray (attributed to Pithou). The writers paint the miseries of the nation and the blindness of their detractors, and they encourage an alliance of the people and the monarchy to save the nation. Notably, Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die praises the work for its \"singularity\" and notes its usefulness to Henry IV. == Bibliography == Satyre Menippee de la Vertu du Catholicon d'Espagne et de la tenue des Estats de Paris, MARTIN Martial (\u00e9dition critique de), Paris, Honor\u00e9 Champion, 2007, \"Textes de la Renaissance\", n\u00b0 117, 944 p. == See also == * Gilles Durant de la Bergerie == References == == External links == * Category:Politics of France Category:Political satire books Category:French political satire Category:French Wars of Religion Category:Literary collaborations Category:1594 books ",
