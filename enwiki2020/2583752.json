Her first claim to fame was as a spectator at a Boston Celtics game in 1986. She had been given free tickets to a Celtics game, which happened to be seated next to NBA prospect John Salley. As CBS's cameras spotted Salley in the crowd, Sykes shook her breasts at the camera, breaking Brent Musburger's attention and prompting him to break into laughter. Sykes, who had previously been self-conscious about her large breasts and had otherwise avoided public appearances because of them, soon \u201cparlayed 15 seconds of fame into a 30-year-career\u201d and became a regular at Celtics games. The Celtics won the 1986 NBA Finals and appeared in (but lost) the 1987 NBA Finals while Busty Heart was in the stands. She mostly ceased appearing at sporting events in 1990, when the St. Louis Cardinals management accused her of public lewdness after attending a Cardinals game. She appeared on the season finale of America's Got Talent (NBC) on October 1, 2008. She also appeared on Rude Tube on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in November 2008. Among her most famous television appearances, she was on Comedy Central's The Man Show, where she demonstrated her talent for crushing beer cans by slamming her breasts on top of them.http://blogs.app.com/saywhat/2010/09/30/busty- heart-shows-how-46h-breasts-are-deadly-weapons/ Busty Heart has done numerous TV shows, including Fox-TV's That's Just Wrong, The WB's Steve Harvey-hosted Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge season finale, Endemol TV's Private Parts on Channel 5 in England, truTV's World's Dumbest, Bravo TV's Outrageous and Contagious Viral Videos, Fuji TV Tokyo Japan \"2006 Bakademy Awards\", E!'s Talk Soup, and 2007 Spike TV MANswers.
