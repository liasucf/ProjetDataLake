    "text": "Heart is a radio network of 13 adult contemporary local stations operated by Global in the United Kingdom, broadcasting a mix of local and networked programming. Ten of the Heart stations are owned by Global, while the other three are operated under franchise agreements. == History == === Launch === Heart began broadcasting in the West Midlands on 6 September 1994 as 100.7 Heart FM, becoming the UK's third Independent Regional Radio station, five days after Century Radio in North East England, and Jazz FM North West. The first song to be played on 100.7 Heart FM was Something Got Me Started by Simply Red. Its original format of \"soft adult contemporary\" music included artists such as Lionel Richie and Tina Turner. Reflecting this, its early slogan was 100.7 degrees cooler! Heart 106.2 began test transmissions in London in August 1995, prior to the station launch on 5 September. This included live broadcasts of WPLJ from New York City. In 1996 the Heart programming format saw the \"soft AC\" music replaced with a generally more neutral rock \"n\" roll playlist. Century 106 in the East Midlands became the third station of the Heart network in 2005 after GCap Media sold Century. Chrysalis' radio holdings were sold to Global Radio in 2007. When GCap Media was taken over by Global Radio in 2008, it announced plans to dissolve the 41-station One Network, with one station (Power FM) becoming part of the Galaxy network, four stations (BRMB, Beacon Radio, Mercia FM and Wyvern FM) forming a West Midlands regional network, seven stations joining Capital FM to form The Hit Music Network and the remaining 29 stations forming the Heart Network. Heart East Midlands was sold to Orion Media, along with the West Midlands network of local stations, due to the same competition concerns that had forced its earlier sale to Chrysalis. === Network restructuring === Between June and September 2010, Global Radio merged the majority of the 33 Heart stations to create a smaller network of 18 local and regional stations, in line with new OFCOM guidelines on local output requirements. Two Hit Music Network stations were also closed and merged with Heart stations. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Merged station !Closed stations !City of licence |- |Heart Cambridgeshire || Heart Peterborough Heart Cambridge || Peterborough later Cambridge |- |Heart Devon (later Heart South West) || Heart Exeter and Heart Torbay Heart Plymouth Heart South Devon Heart North Devon || Exeter |- |Heart East Anglia || Heart Norwich Heart Ipswich || Norwich |- |Heart Essex || Heart Chelmsford & Southend Heart Colchester Ten 17 (rebranded) || Chelmsford |- |Heart Hertfordshire || Rebranded from Hertfordshire's Mercury 96.6 || Watford |- |Heart Four Counties || Heart Northants Heart Milton Keynes Heart Dunstable Heart Bedford || Dunstable, later Milton Keynes |- |Heart North West and Wales || Heart North Wales Coast Heart Cheshire and North East Wales Heart Wirral || Wrexham |- |Heart South Coast || Heart Dorset & New Forest Heart Hampshire || Fareham |- |Heart Sussex and Surrey || Heart Sussex Mercury FM (rebranded) || Brighton |- |Heart Thames Valley || Heart Berkshire Heart Oxfordshire || Reading |- |Heart West Country || Heart Bristol Heart Somerset Heart Bath || Bristol |} Stations in Gloucestershire, Kent, London, the West Midlands, the East Midlands and Wiltshire were unaffected by the changes. Heart Cymru, serving Gwynedd and Anglesey, moved its studios from Bangor to Wrexham but retained its extended local output of 10 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. Heart North West and Wales retained an opt-out on 96.3FM (the North Wales Coast) for Welsh language programming. On 1 January 2011, Orion Media, the owners of Heart East Midlands (one of the original three Heart stations) renamed and relaunched the station as 'Gem 106', ending a franchise agreement with Global Radio formed when Global purchased GCap \u2013 the agreement allowed Orion to use the Heart identity and carry networked programming from London. The move saw Heart's networked programming replaced by local output from Nottingham. === Network expansion === On 19 March 2012, Global Radio announced it had bought the Cornwall ILR station Atlantic FM from joint owners Tindle Radio and Camel Media.Atlantic FM sold to Global to become Heart, RadioToday, 19 March 2012 Atlantic FM became part of the Heart Network and merged with Heart Devon on Monday 7 May 2012 to form Heart South West, which is based in Exeter.UKRD responds to Atlantic's Heart switch, RadioToday, 19 March 2012 On 6 February 2014, Global Radio announced it would be rebranding all Real Radio stations as Heart and would be selling Real Radio Yorkshire and the Northern licence for Real Radio Wales to Communicorp.
