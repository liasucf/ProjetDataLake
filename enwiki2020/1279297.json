    "text": "The Lamborghini V10 is a ninety degree (90\u00b0) V10 petrol engine which was developed for the Lamborghini Gallardo automobile, first sold in 2003. Developed by Lamborghini, for use in the Gallardo, and the first engine developed for Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. after they were acquired by AUDI AG \u2013 part of the Volkswagen Group. This engine has its origins in two concept cars made by Lamborghini, the 1988 P140 and the 1995 Cal\u00e0. Both were equipped with engines having a 3.9-litre displacement. In the early 2000s, Lamborghini resumed the project and the engine was redesigned by increasing its displacement. The crankcase and cylinder block are built at the Audi Hungaria Zrt. factory in Gy\u0151r, Hungary, whilst final assembly is carried out at Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. The engine has a 90\u00b0 vee angle and, unusually for a production engine, a dry sump lubrication system is utilised to keep the center of gravity of the engine low. There was also some speculation that the engine block of the original 5.0-litre Lamborghini V10 was closely based on the Audi 4.2 FSI V8, which Audi produces for its luxury cars. However, this was denied by Audi AG, in their official documentation for their 5.2 FSI V10 engine, as used in the Audi S6 and Audi S8 \u2013 the Lamborghini 5.0 V10 has a cylinder bore spacing of between centres, whereas the Audi 5.2 V10 cylinder bore spacing is , the same as the Audi 4.2 FSI V8. The cylinder heads use the four valves per cylinder layout favoured by the Italian firm, rather than the five valve per cylinder variation formerly favoured by the German members of Volkswagen Group \u2013 including Audi and Volkswagen Passenger Cars. It was later confirmed that the new 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10 is mechanically identical to the Audi 5.2 V10 engine,https://www.evo.co.uk/audi/r8/14165/audi-r8-v-lamborghini-gallardo- lp560-4 as is evident by Lamborghini's usage of Audi's Fuel Stratified Injection, and 90 mm cylinder spacing. ==Specifications== ;engine configuration: 90\u00b0 V10 engine; dry sump lubrication system ;engine displacement etc. :5.0 -- ; bore x stroke: .

The 5.2 V10 used in the S6 and S8 is different in several important aspects, namely a less robust crankshaft with a split pin design, cast aluminum pistons, and a traditional wet-sump oiling system, as well as differences in the valvetrain - all of which, combined, result in the much higher RPM red line and specific power output of the Gallardo and R8) ==See also== *V12 \u2013 6.2/6.5 V12 430-471kW sub-section of the above article *V10 \u2013 5.2 FSI V10 412kW sub-section of the above article *V10 \u2013 5.0 V10 368kW sub- section of the above article ==References== ==External links== *Lamborghini.com official website V10 Category:Gasoline engines by model Category:V10 engines ",
