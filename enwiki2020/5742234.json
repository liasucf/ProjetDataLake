As Regina Beach rests on shores of the south end of Last Mountain Lake, it becomes an active lakeside resort town in summer. To the east is Buena Vista, their boundary marked by 16 Street. While for most of its history Regina Beach students were bused to nearby Lumsden, in 1989 Regina Beach opened its own K-8 elementary school.
