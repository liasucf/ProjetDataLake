Son of Mar\u00eda Salda\u00f1a and Floripo Almengor, he was the nephew of Antonio Salda\u00f1a, the last king of Talamanca who died in 1910. While Salda\u00f1a enjoyed the recognition of Bribris, Cab\u00e9cares, Changuinolas and Borucas and of the recognition (although only ceremonial) of the government of Costa Rica, Siarke was only recognized by the Bribris. He died of tuberculosis at the San Juan de Dios Hospital on January 28, 1922. ==References== Category:People from Lim\u00f3n Province Category:20th-century Costa Rican people Category:Costa Rican politicians Category:Pretenders Category:1922 deaths Category:Indigenous peoples in Costa Rica ",
