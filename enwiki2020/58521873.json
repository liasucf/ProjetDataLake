    "text": "The Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) was officially established in 1963 to collect information on Ethiopian civilization, its history, cultures, and languages.Pankhurst, Richard. \"Institute of Ethiopian Studies.\" In Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N: Vol. 3, edited by Siegbert Uhlig, 168-69. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2007. The Institute includes a research and publication unit, a library, and a museum. It is located at Addis Ababa University, Sidist (6) Kilo campus, which was at the time of the IES's opening, named Haile Selassie I University after the last emperor of Abyssinia. The current director of the Institute is Dr. Ahmed Hassen, an associate professor at the university. == History of the IES == The first director of the Institute was Richard Pankhurst (son of suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst), and the first librarian was Stanislaw Chojnacki. Other directors were F\u00e4qadu Gadamu, Taddesse Tamrat, Tadesse Bayana, Bahru Zewde, Abdussamad Ahmad, Baye Yemam, and Elizabet Walde Giyorgis. == History of the building == The Institute is housed in what was formerly the G\u00e4nn\u00e4ta Le\u2019ul or Princely Paradise Palace, which was constructed in 1934 as the principle palace building for Emperor Haile Selassie and his family.Wall text from 'Coronations and Palace-building,' From Palace to University: A Historical Perspective, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 1936 when Italian forces occupied the city of Addis Ababa, the Fascist Viceroy, Rodolfo Graziani, made it his home and administrative center.Wall text from \"The Italian Occupation, 1936-1941,\" From Palace to University: A Historical Perspective, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The palace became the center of international attention when two Eritrean nationalists attempted to assassinate the viceroy, and Graziani responded by massacring the population of Addis Ababa (remembered as Yekatit 12).Wall text from \"Attempt on Graziani's Life, 1937,\" From Palace to University: A Historical Perspective, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Behind the flag is the spiral staircase was built during the Italian occupation. Each step marked a year of Mussolini's rule. It was meant to symbolize Fascist domination. Upon restoration of Haile Selassie to the throne, the Lion of Judah statue was placed atop the staircase. Upon Italian liberation, Selassie was restored to the throne, and in 1950, the palace became the (unofficial) headquarters of the Empire.Wall text from \"The Palace in the 1950s,\" From Palace to University: A Historical Perspective, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The palace was also the site of the abortive coup d'etat of 1960, and though it failed, it marked the beginning of the Ethiopian student movement, which would publicly demonstrate against the government for political, economic, and social change. The ground floor of the palace was originally a banquet hall, which is now the site of the library. The second floor held the Emperor's bedrooms and study, which is now a part of the Ethnological Museum. == Research and publication unit == This IES unit conducts and publishes research. It publishes conference proceedings, museum catalogues, reference works, and the Journal of Ethiopian Studies (JES), which was founded in 1963. The journal publishes articles in English and Amharic, with editorial support from the Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian Studies at Hamburg University. It published the national bibliography of materials published in and about Ethiopia until 1975, when the National Archives and Library of Ethiopia took over this responsibility. This unit puts on the international Ethiopian Studies conference once every nine years. There is also a monthly seminar held locally at the IES, for researchers to present their findings to each other and university staff and students. == Ethnological museum == This IES unit is the first university museum in Ethiopia. The museum has a permanent collection in five fields of study: anthropology, art, ethnomusicology, numismatics (the study of coinage), and philately (the study of postage stamps). Its hosts temporary exhibitions. It has objects dating back to the early Aksumite period. When the museum opened, it included a zoology species collection, but that is now housed at the Natural History Museum of Ethiopia at Arat (4) Kilo campus. Being the former site of the palace, the museum displays the Emperor Haile Selassie's chambers and his embroidered robes and military uniform. The Society of Friends of the IES was established in 1968 to raise financial support for the museum. ==Library== The IES Library collects in the field of Ethiopian Studies (in the humanities and social sciences) and also preserves Ethiopian manuscripts. Its Wold\u00e4m\u00e4sk\u00e4l Memorial Research Center holds most of the Institute's rare publications and manuscripts in Ge\u2019ez, Amharic, Oromiffa, Tigrinya, and other Ethiopian languages.Ato Demeke Berhane, \"Demeke Explains the Ethiopian Manuscripts of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies.\" Video.
