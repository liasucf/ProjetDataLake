It was named, around 1960, after the previously fictitious peak featured in the book The Ascent of Rum Doodle. There is a small hut at the base (altitude 498m ASL), sleeping 5 people, and two permanently frozen lakes alongside, named Rumdoodle Lake and Lassitude Lake. ==See also== * Airports in Antarctica ==References== ==External links== * Australian Antarctic Gazetteer The North Masson range viewed from offshore, with Mawson Station visible in the foreground Category:Mountains of Mac.
