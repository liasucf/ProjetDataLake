    "text": "The Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang passenger railway is a high-speed railway line in China's Hubei Province and Jiangxi Province, eastern China. The Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang passenger railway follows a similar route to the pre-existing Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang Railway. Presumably, once the former is opened, it will take over a large portion of passenger traffic from the latter. ==Construction== Its first section, from Wuhan to Daye, coincides with the Wuhan\u2013Huangshi line of the Wuhan Metropolitan Area intercity railway. It opened on June 12, 2017. The construction of the Daye-Jiujiang section started in 2013\u20132014. It started operations on September 21, 2017. At Jiujiang, the Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang passenger railway will connect with the Nanchang\u2013Jiujiang intercity railway (opened in 2010), thus providing a continuous high-speed line between Nanchang and Wuhan. ==References== Category:High-speed railway lines in China Category:Rail transport in Hubei Category:Rail transport in Jiangxi Category:Jiujiang Category:Transport in Wuhan ",
