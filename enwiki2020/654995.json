    "text": "R-2 The R-2 Short-range ballistic missile (NATO reporting name SS-2 Sibling, GRAU index 8Zh38) was developed based on the R-1 design. This was an improved version of the German V-2 rocket manufactured by the Soviet Union. == Description == The R-1 was quickly followed by an evolutionary improvement, the R-2 (SS-2), which had a longer range and at least four major differences in design. The weight was increased by 50%, but the range was more than doubled, to . R-2 had the following major differences from the R-1's (and hence from the V-2's) design: *The warhead separated from the rocket prior to atmospheric reentry, eliminating the hull strength problem, one of the V-2/R-1's biggest weaknesses. *The propellant tank became the main load- bearing structure for the rocket, in contrast to the R-1's load-bearing hull. This reduced the overall weight of the spaceframe. *The control module was moved from above the propellant tank to below the LOx tank. This made pre- launch preparations easier. As the control module was now placed directly over the engine, vibrations were reduced by using steel instead of aluminium for the tailcone. *Radio command guidance was introduced to improve accuracy, giving the R-2 accuracy comparable to the R-1, in spite of its doubled range. The first test flight of the R-2 took place in September 1949, and it was accepted for service in November 1951, actually entering service in large numbers around 1953. A grand total of 1,545 R-1 and R-2 missiles were produced. The R-2 missile was the last Soviet missile based on German designs. While some German influences would clearly remain, Soviet missiles after the R-2 would be based on original designs by the OKB-1 group. The R-2A geophysical rocket was developed for vertical sounding flights. It carried dogs, monkeys, hamsters, and various high-altitude physics experiments in its nose cone. Two pods performed atmospheric analysis and were ejected from the missile's side to avoid contamination by engine exhaust. The R-2 design was exported to China, where it was built as the Dongfeng 1. == Operators == ; *Soviet Army == See also == * R-1 (missile) == References == == External links == * R-2 * R-2 / SS-2 SIBLING R-002 Category:Cold War missiles of the Soviet Union ",
