    "text": "Intermission is a two-CD compilation album by Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, bandmates in The Go-Betweens, of material recorded for their solo albums through the 1990s. Although the album was released after the death of McLennan in May 2006, it had been planned since 2000 and a final track list prepared in April 2006. The album title was chosen by McLennan. Forster, in a 2007 interview, explained: \"Grant and I had always planned to take last year off. Our last album Oceans Apart did so well, Intermission was intended to give new fans something to look into and to tide old fans over. When Grant died, I froze. I didn't know what to do about music. Everyone left me alone to decide in my own time and, at the end of 2006, I felt the best thing to do was to carry on as we'd planned; finish sorting Intermission.\" He said the album had always been planned as two separate discs, each presenting their own work: \"We enjoyed those years of exploring our songs apart, they helped us grow. They don't sound like The Go-Betweens, and to force them together retrospectively wouldn't be right.\" The recordings were re-mastered by Bill Inglot and longtime manager Bob Johnson. ==Track listing== ===Robert Forster=== (All songs written by Robert Forster except where marked) # \"Falling Star\" \u2013 4:05 #*Recorded Brisbane, October 1992.
