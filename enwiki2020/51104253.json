    "text": "Progress MS-12 (), Russian production No. 442, identified by NASA as Progress 73P, was a Progress spacecraft used by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). This is the 164th flight of a Progress spacecraft. == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. ==Pre- launch== In 2014, the launch was planned for 1 July 2018, rescheduled for 5 June 2019 and rescheduled to 31 July 2019. The liftoff had been initially set for the two-day rendezvous profile with the station, but the launch time was later shifted to enable a two-orbit (three-hour) flight to the station. ==Launch== Progress MS-12 was launched in 31 July 2019, at 12:10:46 UTC from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, using a Soyuz-2.1a rocket. ==Docking== Progress MS-12 docked with the Pirs docking module. The docking took place 3 hours 18 minutes 31 seconds into the mission (a new record time). == Cargo == The Progress MS-12 spacecraft delivered of dry cargo (in the cargo compartment). * of water (in the Rodnik-system tanks) * of oxygen (in pressurized bottles) * of propellant in the refueling section * of propellant in the integrated propulsion system to the International Space Station. The dry cargo consisted of: * of hardware for onboard systems * of medical supplies * of personal protective gear * of hygiene items * of repairs and servicing equipment * of means of crew support * of food * of payloads * of structural components and other hardware * of NASA cargo. ==Undocking and decay== The Progress MS-12 craft undocked from ISS on 29 November 2019 at 10:25 UTC, initiated braking maneuver at 13:39 UTC, re-entered Earth's atmosphere at 14:11 UTC (end of mission), with any remaining debris impacting a remote part of Pacific Ocean at 14:19 UTC. == See also == * Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station ==References== Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019 Category:2019 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019 ",
