N\u00e1jera is a stopping point on the French Way the most popular path on the Way of St James. == History == The area attracted the Romans, who built the town of Tritium on land which now falls within the boundaries of N\u00e1jera and the neighbouring municipality of Tricio. Subsequently, the area was under Muslim rule and the name N\u00e1jera (Naxara meaning \"town between the rocks\") is of Arabic origin. The town, while still an Islamic possession is the location of the legendary 3-day struggle between Roland, one of Charlemagne's nobles and the Islamic giant Ferragut.Gitlitz & Davidson, The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook, 2000, St Martin's Press, The town was conquered by Ordo\u00f1o II of Leon for Navarre in 923. N\u00e1jera was the capital city of the kingdom of Navarre until it was conquered by Castile in 1054 after the battle of Atapuerca. However, it continued to be multi-cultural. For example, in 1142 the French abbot Peter the Venerable used his visit to Spain to commission translations of important Islamic works, including the first translation of the Qur'an into a European language, and it has been suggested he met with his four translators at N\u00e1jera. From the tenth century, N\u00e1jera had a prosperous Jewish community, which was granted relatively favorable legal status after the Christian conquest. Edward, the Black Prince fought in the Battle of N\u00e1jera in 1367, intervening in a Castilian Civil War on behalf of Pedro of Castile. :See also Najara family, a Sephardic Jewish family, originally from Najera. == Ecclesiastical History == * Established in 923 as Diocese of N\u00e1jera, on territory split off from the suppressed Diocese of Calahorra. * Gained territory twice : in 1077 from Diocese of Pamplona and Diocese of Osma, in 1088 from the suppressed Diocese of \u00c1lava. * Itself Suppressed in 1170, its territory being used to establish the Diocese of Calahorra, to which its last incumbent was appointed. === Episcopal Ordinaries === (all Roman Rite) ;Suffragan Bishops of N\u00e1jera * G\u00f3mez (1046\u20131064) * Munio (1065\u20131080) * Sancho (1080\u20131087) * Sigefredo (1088\u20131089) * Pedro (1089\u20131109) * Sancho de Gra\u00f1\u00f3n (1109\u20131116) * Sancho de Funes (1118\u20131146) * Rodrigo de Cascante (1146\u20131170); later Bishop of successor see Calahorra (1170\u20131190) === Titular see === The diocese was nominally restored in 1969 as Latin Titular bishopric of Naiera (Curiate Italian and Latin; Latin adjective Naiaren(sis) / N\u00e1jera (Spanish).
