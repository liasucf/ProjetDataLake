    "text": "In mathematics, discrete Chebyshev polynomials, or Gram polynomials, are a type of discrete orthogonal polynomials used in approximation theory, introduced by and rediscovered by . ==Elementary Definition== The discrete Chebyshev polynomial t^N_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n in x, for n = 0, 1, 2,\\ldots, N -1, constructed such that two polynomials of unequal degree are orthogonal with respect to the weight function : w(x) = \\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} \\delta(x-r) with \\delta(\\cdot) being the Dirac delta function. That is, : \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t^N_n(x) t^N_m (x) w(x) = 0 \\quad {\\rm if\\ }\\quad n e m . The integral on the left is actually a sum because of the delta function, and we have, : \\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_m (r) = 0 \\quad {\\rm if\\ }\\quad n e m. Thus, even though t^N_n(x) is a polynomial in x, only its values at a discrete set of points, x = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1 are of any significance. Nevertheless, because these polynomials can be defined in terms of orthogonality with respect to a nonnegative weight function, the entire theory of orthogonal polynomials is applicable. In particular, the polynomials are complete in the sense that : \\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_n (s) = 0 \\quad {\\rm if\\ }\\quad r e s. Chebyshev chose the normalization so that : \\sum_{r = 0}^{N-1} t^N_n(r) t^N_n (r) = \\frac{N}{2n+1} \\prod_{k=1}^n (N^2 - k^2). This fixes the polynomials completely along with the sign convention, t^N_n(N - 1) > 0. ==Advanced Definition== Let f be a smooth function defined on the closed interval [\u22121, 1], whose values are known explicitly only at points xk := \u22121 + (2k \u2212 1)/m, where k and m are integers and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m. The task is to approximate f as a polynomial of degree n < m. Consider a positive semi-definite bilinear form :\\left(g,h\\right)_d:=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}{g(x_k)h(x_k)}, where g and h are continuous on [\u22121, 1] and let :\\left\\|g\\right\\|_d:=(g,g)^{1/2}_{d} be a discrete semi-norm. Let \\varphi_k be a family of polynomials orthogonal to each other :\\left( \\varphi_k, \\varphi_i\\right)_d=0 whenever i is not equal to k. Assume all the polynomials \\varphi_k have a positive leading coefficient and they are normalized in such a way that :\\left\\|\\varphi_k\\right\\|_d=1. The \\varphi_k are called discrete Chebyshev (or Gram) polynomials. ==References== * * Category:Orthogonal polynomials Category:Approximation theory ",
