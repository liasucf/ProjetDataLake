He is a past president of the American Philosophical Association and the Philosophy of Science Association and has for many years been on the editorial board of the journal Philosophy of Science, one of the leading publications in the field. In 2014, Fine was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist2014.pdf ==Philosophical work== Fine famously proposed the natural ontological attitude (NOA) as a resolution to the debates over scientific realism. This philosophy takes on a neutral stance of realist and antirealist attitudes of acceptance in the industry's best theories, and calls out mistakes across existing theories.plato.stanford.edu Fine also developed one of the possible interpretations of quantum mechanics yet to be decided between and has contributed to the probabilistic understanding of Bell's theorem. In 2001, Fine gave the following re-counting of the birth of NOA and its important relationship to Bas van Fraassen's antirealism: > The Scientific Image arrived in 1980 like a breath of fresh air. Although in > the introduction van Fraassen counts me among the realist foot soldiers, at > just that time Micky Forbes and I were engaged in rethinking the whole > realism/antirealism issue. The result was NOA. Van Fraassen\u2019s powerful and > enlightening monograph encouraged us in that project. If Micky and I are > parents of NOA, then Bas is perhaps a godfather. Paul Teller too, since he > was among the people then who helped us refine our ideas as they > developed.Fine, Arthur (2001) \"The Scientific Image 20 Years Later\" > Philosophical Studies. p.207. ==See also== *American philosophy *List of American philosophers == References == == External links == * Arthur Fine's page in University of Washington website Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:21st-century American philosophers Category:Philosophers of science ",
