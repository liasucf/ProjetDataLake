The body and voice of the divided entity are used to utter a spectrum of opposed sensations - caused by the division - and heightened sensitiveness related to the subject. The divided entity is seeking a unification, which will not happen without the approval and support of the imaginary love- god.http://www.brooklynfilmfestival.org/films/detail.asp?fid=607 ==Characters== (Reference for this paragraph Festival program BIFF New York City 2006)http://www.brooklynfilmfestival.org/films/detail.asp?fid=607 \\- http://www.flandersimage.com/browse-films/detail/love-is-the-only-master- ill-serve *The Whisper Kid, symbolizes a personalized love-god. **she looks with a certain distance and neutrality at the two creatures who address themselves to her; **her image is of pureness and young innocence; **to cut across this well-spread definition she smokes a big curled hanging pipe; **sometimes she blows and creates air bubbles of soap with the inhaled smoke; **by these actions the child character reveals a mysterious, elusive background of her own timelessness, of someone who could possibly be aged but appears this time in a gentle, different form. *Luna, a human female mortal addressing herself indirectly (and sometimes directly) to the imaginary love- god. **she figures as a sculpture, perplexed by the whisper kid, but finally she looks straight in a static camera while she sings her ode to love, she expresses her devotion to the subject (\"love is the only master I'll serve\") by her self-chosen verbal communication; **her body almost does not move, we only see a severe, sometimes frightened, sometimes completely desperate-for- love face expression. *Serena, a human female mortal, addresses herself indirectly (and sometimes directly) to the imaginary love-god. **she communicates her devotion to the subject by physical expression; **she dances, using a whole spectrum of facial and body statements, interrupted with spasmodic blitzes of short falling moves and/or like electric shocks, like face and body are crying of pain and uncontrolled passion originated by the subject (as it appears sometimes when long periods of a constant energetic and inner peaceful mood is suddenly effected from outside, unexpectedly and on first sight unnecessary, like the pain of a needle in a body which is in a gentle, lovely sleeping state, a pain, abrupt and short, but more hurting, much deeper as one isn\u2019t prepared for it). ==Credits Production== *Written and directed by Nicholas Lens Cast *Louise Peterhoff - Serena *Claron McFadden - Luna *Clara-Lane Lens - The Whisper Kid Crew *Photography and camera - Renaat Lambeets *Choreography - Louise Peterhoff *Music and libretto - Nicholas Lens *Art director - Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Limbosch *Editing - Simone Rau *Additional editing - Stefan Rijcken *Location - Karnak room, Axel Vervoordt, Wijnegem, Belgiumhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/396809417141513471/ *Shooting days - April 16\u201317, 2005 *Executive producer - Brigitte Baudine *Presented by Tabaran Company *Produced by Nicholas LensFestival program BIFF New York City 2006 ==Soundtrack== Music production: The Accacha Chronicles 3rd part, Amor Aeternus - Hymns of Love, Nicholas Lens Soloists * Claron McFadden, Ian Honeyman, Henk Lauwers, Derek Lee Ragin, Elka Simeonova, Galya Haralambieva, Paul G\u00e9rimon, Clara-Lane Lens, Angelite -Bulgarian Voices Recording and mixing *Acoustic studios - Sofia, Tabaran Studio - Brussels, ICP - Brussels, Villa\u00efda - Casablanca, Bleu Nuit - Brussels, villalou - Cape Town *Distributed by Sony BMG Classics (CD 82876 66238 2, 2005) *Published by Schott Music International, Mainz/New York City ==References== ==External links== * Biff, New York * Schott Music International * Internet Movie Database Category:2006 films Category:Compositions by Nicholas Lens ",
