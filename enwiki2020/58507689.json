Whitehill Welfare were the reigning champions, but not defend their title after moving to the Lowland League. The league was split into two separate divisions, the Premier Division and the First Division. This season saw a reduction in the number of clubs from 26 to 20, due to the departure of nine clubs who left to join the inaugural Lowland Football League, although additional reserve teams joined the league to boost numbers. ==Premier Division== The 2013\u201314 Premier Division saw a reduction in the number of clubs from twelve to ten, due to the departure of seven clubs to the newly-formed Lowland Football League. As a result, Edinburgh University and Tynecastle retained their place in the division despite finishing in the previous season's relegation places. Three clubs were promoted from the First Division and two reserve teams also entered the division. ===Teams=== The following teams have changed division since the 2012\u201313 season. ====To Premier Division==== Promoted from First Division * Coldstream * Craigroyston * Leith Athletic Spartans and Stirling University entered reserve teams after their move to the Lowland Football League. ====From Premier Division==== Transferred to Lowland Football League * Edinburgh City * Gretna 2008 * Preston Athletic * Spartans * Stirling University * Vale of Leithen * Whitehill Welfare ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
