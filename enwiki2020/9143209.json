    "text": "Megatop Phoenix is the fourth and final studio album by the original line-up of English band Big Audio Dynamite, released on 5 September 1989 by CBS Records. Mick Jones and Bill Price produced the album. It was recorded at the Kinks' Konk Studios in Hornsey, London, who were considered an inspiration in the album's liner notes. Megatop Phoenix was the last album to be released under the name of Big Audio Dynamite for six years (until 1995's F-Punk). A year after this album's release Mick Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite II with totally different members. The phoenix in the title is a reference to a near- death experience of Jones, who had developed chickenpox and pneumonia, and spent several months in hospital prior to recording this album. The album reached #26 on the UK album chart and #85 on the Billboard 200 albums in the USA. ==Track listing== ==Samples== The album makes copious use of sampling from various musical and other sources.
