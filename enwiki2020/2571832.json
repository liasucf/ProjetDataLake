The park features expansive views of Monterey Bay and Pacific Ocean from its hiking trails. Other vistas include the San Benito Valley, Salinas Valley, and the Santa Lucia Mountains east of Big Sur. The park was established in 1934. ==Natural history== Pine and California oak woodlands, of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, cover much of the park and are home to many birds and mammals. ==Recreation== Fremont Peak State Park has hiking trails, picnic facilities and 22 campsites (both tent and RV). Fremont Peak Day is held every April, and features a picnic and other activities. The Fremont Peak Observatory opened in 1986, and has operated every summer since, despite having battled the frequently brutal mountaintop weather.
