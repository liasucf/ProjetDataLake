    "text": "Alfred Charles William Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe (15 July 1865 \u2013 14 August 1922), was a British newspaper and publishing magnate. As owner of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, he was an early developer of popular journalism, and he exercised vast influence over British popular opinion during the Edwardian era. Lord Beaverbrook said he was \"the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street.\"Lord Beaverbrook, Politicians and the War, 1914\u20131916 (1928) 1:93. About the beginning of the 20th century there were increasing attempts to develop popular journalism intended for the working class and tending to emphasize sensational topics. Harmsworth was the main innovator. Northcliffe had a powerful role during the First World War, especially by criticizing the government regarding the Shell Crisis of 1915. He directed a mission to the new ally, the United States, during 1917, and was director of enemy propaganda during 1918. His Amalgamated Press employed writers such as Arthur Mee and John Hammerton, and its subsidiary, the Educational Book Company, published The Harmsworth Self-Educator, The Children's Encyclop\u00e6dia, and Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia. ==Biography== ===Early life and success=== Born in Chapelizod, County Dublin, the son of Alfred and Geraldine Harmsworth, he was educated at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, England, from 1876 and at Henley House School in Kilburn, London from 1878. A master at Henley House who was to prove important to his future was J. V. Milne, the father of A. A. Milne, who according to H. G. Wells was at school with him at the time and encouraged him to start the school magazine.H. G. Wells, An Experiment in Autobiography, Chapter 6 In 1880 he first visited the Sylvan Debating Club, founded by his father, and of which he later served as Treasurer. Beginning as a freelance journalist, he initiated his first newspaper, Answers (original title: Answers to Correspondents), and was later assisted by his brother Harold, who was adept in business matters. Harmsworth had an intuitive sense for what the reading public wanted to buy, and began a series of cheap but successful periodicals, such as Comic Cuts (tagline: \"Amusing without being Vulgar\") and the journal Forget-Me-Not for women. From these periodicals, he developed the largest periodical publishing company in the world, Amalgamated Press. Boyce (2004). His half-penny periodicals published in the 1890s played a role in the decline of the Victorian penny dreadfuls. Harmsworth was an early developer of popular journalism. He bought several failing newspapers and made them into an enormously profitable news group, primarily by appealing to the general public. He began with The Evening News during 1894, and then merged two Edinburgh papers to form the Edinburgh Daily Record. That same year he funded an expedition to Franz Joseph Land in the Arctic with the intention of making attempts to travel to the North Pole. Brice, Arthur Montefiore, and H. Fisher. \"The Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition, Notes of the Last Year's Work.\" The Geographical Journal 8.6 (1896): 543\u2013564. online On 4 May 1896 he began publishing the Daily Mail in London, which was a success, having the world record for daily circulation until Harmsworth's death; taglines of the Daily Mail included \"the busy man's daily journal\" and \"the penny newspaper for one halfpenny\". Prime Minister Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, said it was \"written by office boys for office boys\".Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 1975 Harmsworth then transformed a Sunday newspaper, the Weekly Dispatch, into the Sunday Dispatch, then the greatest circulation Sunday newspaper in Britain. He also initiated the Harmsworth Magazine (later London Magazine 1898\u20131915), utilizing one of Britain's best editors, Beckles Willson, who had been editor of many successful publications, including The Graphic. During 1899 Harmsworth was responsible for the unprecedented success of a charitable appeal for the dependents of soldiers fighting in the South African War by inviting Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Sullivan to write the song \"The Absent-Minded Beggar\".Cannon, John. \"The Absent-Minded Beggar\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, March 1987, Vol. 11, No. 8, pp. 16\u201317, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London. Harmsworth also initiated The Daily Mirror during 1903, and rescued the financially desperate Observer and The Times during 1905 and 1908, respectively. During 1908, he also acquired The Sunday Times. The Amalgamated Press subsidiary the Educational Book Company published the Harmsworth Self- Educator, The Children's Encyclop\u00e6dia, and Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia. Boyce (2004). He brought his younger brothers into his media empire, and they all flourished: Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, Cecil Harmsworth, 1st Baron Harmsworth, Sir Leicester Harmsworth, 1st Baronet and Sir Hildebrand Harmsworth, 1st Baronet. ===Ennobled=== Harmsworth was created a Baronet, of Elmwood, in the parish of St Peters in the County of Kent during 1904. During 1905, Harmsworth was raised to the peerage as Baron Northcliffe, of the Isle of Thanet in the County of Kent, and during 1918 was created Viscount Northcliffe, of St Peter's in the County of Kent, for his service as the director of the British war mission in the United States. ==Marriage== Alfred Harmsworth married Mary Elizabeth Milner on 11 April 1888. She was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) and Dame of Grace, Order of St John (D.St.J) during 1918. They did not have any children. ===Children=== Lord Northcliffe had four acknowledged children by two different women. The first, Alfred Benjamin Smith, was born when Harmsworth was seventeen years old; the mother was a sixteen-year-old maidservant in his parents' home.Taylor The Great Outsiders pp.10\u201311 Smith died during 1930, allegedly in a mental home.Taylor The Great Outsiders p. 222 By 1900, Harmsworth had acquired a new mistress, an Irishwoman named Kathleen Wrohan, about whom little is known but her name; she bore him two further sons and a daughter, and died during 1923.Taylor The Great Outsiders pp. 47\u201348 and p. 222. ==Political influence== By 1914 Northcliffe controlled 40% of the morning newspaper circulation, 45% of the evening and 15% of the Sunday circulation in Britain.Tompson, \"Fleet Street Colossus\" p. 115. June, 1917 Northcliffe's ownership of The Times, the Daily Mail and other newspapers meant that his editorials influenced both \"the classes and the masses\". That meant that in an era before radio, television or internet, Northcliffe dominated the British press \"as it never has been before or since by one man\". Northcliffe's editorship of the Daily Mail in the years just before the First World War in which the newspaper displayed \"a virulent anti-German sentiment\" caused The Star to declare, \"Next to the Kaiser, Lord Northcliffe has done more than any living man to bring about the war\". His newspapers, especially The Times, reported the Shell Crisis of 1915 with such zeal that it helped to end the Liberal government of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, which forced Asquith to form a coalition government (the other causal event was the resignation of Admiral Fisher as First Sea Lord). Northcliffe's newspapers propagandized for creating a Minister of Munitions, which was held first by David Lloyd George, and helped to bring about Lloyd George's appointment as prime minister in 1916. Lloyd George offered Northcliffe a job in his cabinet, but Northcliffe refused and was instead appointed director for propaganda. Boyce (2004). Such was Northcliffe's influence on anti-German propaganda during the World War I that a German warship was sent to shell his house, Elmwood, in Broadstairs, in an attempt to assassinate him. His former residence still bears a shell hole out of respect for his gardener's wife, who was killed in the attack. On 6 April 1919, Lloyd George made an excoriating attack on Harmsworth, terming his arrogance \"diseased vanity\". By then, Harmsworth's influence was decreasing. Northcliffe's enemies accused him of power without responsibility, but his papers were a factor in settling the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, and his mission to the United States in 1917 has been judged successful by historians.John Cannon, ed., The Oxford Companion to British History (2002) p. 454. Northcliffe's personality shaped his career. He was monolingual and not well-educated and knew little history or science. He had a lust for power and for money, while leaving the accounting paperwork to his brother Harold. He imagined himself Napoleon reborn and resembled the emperor physically and in terms of his enormous energy and ambition. Above all, he had a boyish enthusiasm for everything. Norman Fyfe, an intimate friend, described him: > Boyish in his power of concentration upon the matter of the moment, boyish > in his readiness to turn swiftly to a different matter and concentrate on > that.... Boyish the limited range of his intellect, which seldom concerns > itself with anything but the immediate, the obvious, the popular. Boyish his > irresponsibility, his disinclination to take himself or his publications > seriously; his conviction that whatever benefits them is justifiable, and > that it is not his business to consider the effect of their contents on the > public mind.Hamilton Fyfe, Northcliffe an Intimate Biography (1930) p. 106. ==Sport== In 1903 Harmsworth initiated the Harmsworth Cup, the first international award for motorboat racing. ===Motoring=== Harmsworth was a friend of Claude Johnson, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Limited, and during the years preceding the First World war became an enthusiast of the Rolls- Royce Silver Ghost car. ==Death== Lord Northcliffe circa 1921 driving a Fordson tractor at Henry Ford's farm near Dearborn, Michigan. Northcliffe was on a world tour at the time, trying to recover his health, but he died in 1922. He had been closely involved in the purchase of Fordson tractors by the British government during the First World War. Monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West Lord Northcliffe's health declined during 1921 due mainly to a streptococcal infection. His mental health collapsed; he acted like a madman but historians say it was a physical malady.Brendon (2003) pp 53\u201362. He went on a world tour to revive himself, but it failed to do so. He died of endocarditis in his London house, No. 1 Carlton House Gardens, on 14 August, 1922. Retrieved 23 November 2013. He left three months' pay to each of his six thousand employees. The viscountcy, barony, and baronetcy of Northcliffe became extinct. A monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London, was unveiled in 1930. The obelisk was designed by Edwin Lutyens and the bronze bust is by Kathleen Scott. His body was buried at East Finchley Cemetery in North London. ==Legacy== Historian Ian Christopher Fletcher states: A. J. P. Taylor, however, says, \"Northcliffe could destroy when he used the news properly. He could not step into the vacant place. He aspired to power instead of influence, and as a result forfeited both.\"A.J.P. Taylor, English History 1914-1945 (1965) p 27. P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: The A. Harmsworth Glacier in North Greenland was named by Robert Peary in his honour. Harmsworth had gifted Peary expedition ship \"Windward\" following a lecture on Polar exploration he gave at the Royal Geographical Society in 1897.Daniel E. Harmon, Robert Peary. 2013 ===Promotion of Group Settlement Scheme=== Through his newspaper career, Northcliffe promoted the ideas which resulted in the Group Settlement Scheme. The scheme promised land in Western Australia to British settlers prepared to emigrate and develop the land. A town founded specifically to assist the new settlements was named Northcliffe, in recognition of Lord Northcliffe's promotion of the scheme. Northcliffe lived for a time at 31 Pandora Road, West Hampstead \u2013 this site is now marked with an English Heritage blue plaque. ==See also== * Daily Mail aviation prizes ==References== ==Further reading== * Bingham, Adrian. \"The Daily Mail and the First World War\" History Today (Dec 2013) 63#12 pp 1-8. * Boyce, D.
