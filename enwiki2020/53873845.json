Kranok pattern (, ) is one of the most important Thai motif patterns, because it appears in many Thai artworks such as Tripi\u1e6daka cabinets, the doors of Thai temples, and coffins. According to the Royal Institute Dictionary in 1982, the definition of Kranok refers to a pattern of lines. However, when it is written as Kanok, it means gold. The pattern basically shows the repetition of right triangles. The triangles may be the same size or different sizes. Often the pointy part of the triangle goes right with each other in the same direction. In the Sanskrit language Kra-nok means thorns. == History == ===The origin of Lai Thai pattern=== The Thai pattern is inspired from nature, for example; * Lotus * Jasmine * Java Cassia * Sea Iceland Cotton ===The origin of Lai Kranok pattern=== There are many types of Lai Kranok. The prototype of Lai Kranok is from the character of flame. Kranok Sam-Tua is the motif of other Kranok.

From the origin of Thai pattern the sacred lotus is the original of Kranok Sam-Tua, so before drawing we should know the components of Kranok which is very important e.g. drawing the notch and the apex of Kranok. === The notch === The notch or bezel which called by the ancient master. The notch is dividing the distance of line around Kranok equally. To draw the notch has 2 ways; * The notch in The notch in has a character similar to the petal of the lotus bud. The petal line is bended into the flower. To bring the lotus petal to draw as the notch have to separately draw the end of the notch to far from each other. The distance of the depth is about a half of the notch. * The notch out The notch out has character similar to the petal of the lotus bloom. The petal line is bended from the flower. To bring the lotus petal to draw as the notch have to separately draw the end of the notch to far from each other. The distance of the depth is about a half of the notch. The notch out is same with the notch in, but opposite side. === The apex of Kranok === The apex of Kranok is the most important. If Kranok body has the perfect proportion but the apex is too strong the Kranok will out of the beauty. The exemplar and inspiration of Kranok pattern is the flame. To draw the apex have to draw flutter and bland like a flame or a tail of eel. == Purpose == The purpose of Thai pattern is to be used in religious institutions and the monarchy.

Although different patterns exist, slight variations on design can be observed. Generally, the shape of the Kranok pattern originated from a lotus flower and derived from the appearance of the flame. == Designs == To make the Kranok line look strong and lively, many artists draw the Yhuk (\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01) shape. It looks like a small triangle with a curve. Yhuk (\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01) is located on the side of the triangle. The spaces between each Yuk (\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01) must be even. The top part of the triangle in the Kranok pattern is called Yaud Kranok (\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e01).
