    "text": "Lajka (in English: Laika) is a 2017 Czech science fiction comedy animated film. It is inspired by Soviet space dog Laika. ==Plot== The film starts in Baikonur. A female dog is captured while trying to find something to feed her puppies. She is named Laika and brought to a local spaceport. Professor Voroljov and his assistant Kokotov begin preparing Laika for space travel. On the day before the launch, Laika manages to get out of her cage and visits the space rocket. Then she returns for her puppies and smuggles them into the rocket. The following day she is launched into space along with her pups hidden in the rocket. The news of Laika's travel to space arrive to the United States. The Americans, in response, send a chimpanzee named Ham to space. Ham is soon followed by other rockets with various animals. All rockets arrive at a planet named Qem. They meet the natives of the planet and are accompanied by a native named Quirkrk. The animals are happy in the new environment as there are no humans. The Soviets however soon send cosmonaut Jurij Levobo\u010dkin to space. He is initially sent to the Moon, but arrives at Qem instead. He then meets Lajka, and settles down, but soon begins craving meat. Qem's natives soon go missing; it is revealed that Levobo\u010dkin invented a \"freezer gun\" and is hunting and eating them. Laika and Ham are fighting him just as he is about to bake Quirkrk. The clash ends when Levobo\u010dkin falls into the furnace, and the animals leave. Levobo\u010dkin, however, survives, now wanting revenge, and the animals prepare for battle against him. The American astronaut Neil Knokaut arrives and eventually joins Levobo\u010dkin in hunting. Laika outsmarts them and Levobo\u010dkin and Knokaut freeze each other. ==Voice actors== * Helena Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1 as Laika * Karel Zima as Jurij Levobo\u010dkin * Petr \u010ctvrtn\u00ed\u010dek as Quirkrk * Jan Vondr\u00e1\u010dek as Ham * Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd as Neil Knokaut * Robert Neb\u0159ensk\u00fd as Professor Voroljov * Jan Buda\u0159 as Assistant Kokotov ==Awards== *2017 Czech Lion Awards, Stage Design category winner ==See also== *List of animated feature-length films ==References== ==External links== * * Lajka.eu - official website Category:2017 films Category:Czech animated science fiction films Category:Czech films Category:Czech science fiction comedy films Category:Czech-language films Category:Czech Lion Awards winners (films) ",
