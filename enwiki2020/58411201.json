Daniel D'Addario of Variety described the series as \"a delight that poses the question of what it really means to grow up, against a truly inviting backdrop,\" and that Collins is \"an inherently winsome performer who has never been quite as well used as she is here.\" Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a \"B\" and wrote, \"If you need a five-hour brain vacation, Paris is a worthwhile destination.\" The New Zealand Herald considered the show \"visually delectable\" and that \"Collins has a pixie-ish charm which makes her endearing\", but also that the show is \"as ephemeral as fairy floss.\" However, Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the series one out of five stars, praising Collins for her \"amiably breezy\" performance, but warns viewers \"the show is far better if you stop looking for rhyme or reason and just look at the scenery\". However it was met with a negative reception from French critics, who condemned the show for being racist and negatively stereotyping Parisians and the French.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/plenty-to-feel-insulted- about-french-critics-round-on-emily-in-paris Charles Martin wrote in Premi\u00e8re that the show unfairly stereotyped and depicted the French as \"lazy and never arrive at the office before the end of the morning, that they are flirtatious and not really attached to the concept of loyalty, that they are sexist and backward, and [...] have a questionable relationship with showering\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/embarrassing-netflixs-emily- in-paris-blasted-by-french- critics?utm_medium=social&utm;_source=twitterhttps://www.premiere.fr/Series/News- Series/Emily-in-Paris-cest-un-peu-Sex-in-the-City-de-le-France- critiquehttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/17/emily-in-paris- unrealistic-escapist-tv ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American comedy-drama television series Category:2020s American romantic comedy television series Category:2020s American workplace comedy television series Category:2020s American workplace drama television series Category:English-language Netflix original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series created by Darren Star Category:Television shows filmed in France Category:Television shows filmed in Illinois Category:Television shows set in Paris ",
