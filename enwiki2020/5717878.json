    "text": "Orlando Urdaneta (b. October 24, 1950 - Maracaibo, Venezuela) is a Venezuelan actor and television personality. He was one of the most outspoken critics of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his fear of retaliation from the Bolivarian Circles made him decide to live in a self-imposed exile in Miami. He worked in \"La hora de Orlando\" which was broadcast by La Familia Cosmovision in Miami. He currently works for Telefutura Network's nightly program \"Noche de Perros.\" Urdaneta received in 1997 the Premio Municipal de Teatro, awarded the best actor and the best theater actor by La Casa del Artista in 1999. During the years 1998 and 1999, he also won the award as best actor from the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Artistas Cinematogr\u00e1ficos (ANAC) for his role in Pandemonium and Cien A\u00f1os de Perd\u00f3n. As co-writer of Pandemonium, he won the award for the best film screenplay by La Casa del Artista. He has hosted over the years several TV and radio programs, such as La Rueda de la Fortuna, D'Noche, Estudio 15, Buenos D\u00edas Venezuela, Orlando con Orlando, and Almorzando con Orlando, the latter seen on Televen in 2004. Also Aqu\u00ed entre nos was seen throughout Latin America and the United States. On radio, he hosted with Pedro Le\u00f3n Zapata, a humor and political satire program entitled P\u00e1jaro que vas volando. However, it was with his programs Titulares de Ma\u00f1ana and La Hora de Orlando, broadcast by Globovisi\u00f3n, that his criticism against the policies of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez became more vocal. The presentation of his theater production, Orlando en Cadena was sabotaged during July 2002 by the Bolivarian Circles and some of the public was allegedly attacked. In the 1980s he lived in the Dominican Republic. In July 2004, he decided to move to Miami, United States, with his wife, Morella Ramia, and their two daughters. ==Filmography== ===Films=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Title ! Director !
