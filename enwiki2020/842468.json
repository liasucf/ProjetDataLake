To her parents' unease she started singing in local bars in 1980. She made her trio el\u00e9trico debut soon afterward, during the 1981 carnival. Mercury's zeal for dance eventually led her to the Federal University of Bahia, where she enrolled in the Dance School in 1984.

The next year she gave birth to daughter Giovana Almeida P\u00f3voas. ==Career== ===Early career (1984\u20131990)=== From 1986 to 1988, Mercury was the lead singer for the band Cheiro de Amor.Daniela Mercury on MPB Dictionary Mercury continued to pursue a career in music and, by 1988, was a backup singer for Gilberto Gil. In 1989, recorded her first two albums as the lead singer of pop band Companhia Clic. Their songs \"Pega que Oh!\" and \"Ilha das Bananas\" became minor hits in Bahia radio stations. As the 1990s began, Mercury decided to pursue a solo career. ===Rise to fame (1991\u20131993)=== Mercury's self-titled debut album was released in 1991 through independent record company Eldorado. The lead single of the album, \"Swing da Cor\", which features Olodum, became a number-one hit in Brazil, and the album was soon known as Swing da Cor. Another song from the album, \"Menino do Pel\u00f4\", which also features Olodum, became Mercury's second top-ten hit in Brazil, charting at number four. On the following year, Mercury shut off from the record company and, ever since, produces her own albums to negotiate the distribution of them later with the labels that are interested. In 1992, she presented the project \"Som do Meio-Dia\" (Midday Sound) at the Art Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo (MASP). The show brought together over thirty thousand spectators, which eventually leave the traffic jam in the vicinity of the Paulista Avenue. After forty-minutes concert, Daniela was removed from the stage by representatives of the S\u00e3o Paulo tourist office, that concerned with the museum structure, obtained an order from the military police to remove it from the local. Soon after the show, Daniela was hired by Sony Music label and through this, released her second solo album, O Canto da Cidade. The album sold over 2.5 million copies in Brazil alone (which made Mercury the first artist to receive a double-diamond certification in her country) and was considered by journalist Andr\u00e9 Domingues one of the best MPB albums ever. O Canto da Cidade is Mercury's album with most number-one songs (four in total; \"O Canto da Cidade\", \"O Mais Belo dos Belos\", \"Batuque\" and \"Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Entende Nada/Cotidiano\"). O Canto da Cidade is recognized as the album responsible for taking Ax\u00e9 Music to mainstream audiences in Brazil. The album also yielded Mercury, a year-end special on Rede Globo channel, which were mixed with live performances in the square of Apotheosis in Rio de Janeiro, and video clips with Caetano Veloso, Herbert Vianna and Tom Jobim. Years later, the special, previously unreleased in video was released on DVD to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the release of the album. In July 1993, Mercury was one of Brazil's attractions at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Some consider O Canto da Cidade was the forerunner of the samba-reggae movement, then called Ax\u00e9 Music, gaining strength in all regions of the country and allowing other genre artists, were featured in the Brazilian music scene. It is believed that after this album, the Carnival of Bahia gained a massive media coverage. Mercury experienced during this period, a peak of popularity rarely seen in the history of Brazilian music industry, being dubbed \"the hurricane of Bahia\" and \"Queen of the Ax\u00e9\". ===Artistic development (1994\u20132000)=== In 1994, M\u00fasica de Rua was released through Sony. The album was received with lukewarm reviews, with some critics complaining about the similarities between this album and its predecessor. Nevertheless, the album was very well received by the public, selling more than one million copies and producing the hits \"M\u00fasica de Rua\", \"O Reggae e o Mar\" (both number-one hits), \"Por Amor ao Il\u00ea\" (a top-ten hit) and \"A Rosa\" (top-twenty). This was Mercury's first album to produce singles which have failed to chart. In 1996, Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was released through Sony. This album was much better received by the critics than its predecessor. It is Mercury's most well rated album at Allmusic, with four and a half stars. As of today, Feij\u00e3o com Arroz is Mercury's second best selling album, behind only O Canto da Cidade. It produced the hits \"\u00c0 Primeira Vista\", \"Nobre Vagabundo\", \"Rapunzel\" (all number-one hits), \"Minas com Bahia\" (which features Samuel Rosa from Skank and was a top-twenty hit) and \"Feij\u00e3o de Corda\" (a top-ten hit). In 1998, Mercury's first live album, El\u00e9trica was released through Sony. It sold almost half a million copies and produced the top-ten hit \"Trio Metal\", which charted at number eight. ===Experimentation with electronica (2000\u20132004)=== Mercury performing in the concert Solidariedade Brasil-Noruega on October 7, 2003 in Teatro Nacional, Bras\u00edlia In 2000, Mercury released her fifth studio album, Sol da Liberdade, through BMG. The album sold almost a million copies and produced two number-one singles (\"Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra\" and a cover of Antonio Marcus' \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea\"). The album, which was produced by Suba, was innovative in Mercury's career for its fusion with electronic music sounds. The following year, Mercury released Sou de Qualquer Lugar through BMG. The album sold half of its predecessor, but was able to produce the number-one single \"Mutante\", a cover of Rita Lee. In this album, Mercury also experimented with electronic sounds. In April 2003, Mercuy's second live album, MTV ao Vivo \u2013 Eletrodom\u00e9stico, was released through BMG. It was recorded on January 23 and 24 of that same year at the Castro Alves Theater in Salvador for MTV Brasil. It was also released in the DVD format, Mercury's first. Among the artists who performed with the singer were Dulce Pontes, Rosario Flores, Jovanotti, Carlinhos Brown and Olodum. The sales were very inferior to Mercury's previous and it only produced one top twenty hit (\"Meu Plano\"). In 2004, Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico was released through BMG. For the recording of this album, Mercury invited DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine. It is a commemorative disc celebrating the five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music in Bahian Carnaval. The disc received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a TIM Award for best female pop/rock vocalist. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil's most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9. ===Back to basics (2005\u20132007)=== In 2005, Cl\u00e1ssica was released through Som Livre on both CD and DVD. Recorded from a concert Mercury gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo's Casa de Espet\u00e1culo, the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and some of her biggest MPB hits. The record signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from record companies to gain full control of her work. Mercury was in London, during the July 7 bombings. That same year, Mercury's eighth studio album, Bal\u00e9 Mulato, was released, but through EMI. The album was very well received by the critics, with some even saying it was Mercury's best album since Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996). It was not, however, very well received by the public, with none of the singles being able to chart on the top-ten; a large part due to lack of record company support. The next year, the Latin Grammy Award-winning live version of Bal\u00e9 Mulato, was released. Daniela Mercury has completed her newest release, Canib\u00e1lia. Canibalia was launched in October 2009. ===Reinventing popular culture with Canib\u00e1lia and working with Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos (2007\u20132013)=== Mercury in 2010. On November 19, 2007, the singer released \"Preta\", which features Seu Jorge. The song, which is strongly influenced by samba, was one of the most played in the country during the carnival. For the 2009's Carnival, Mercury recorded the song \"Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s\", who wrote with Alfredo Moura and Margareth Menezes. The theme, based on the song \"Ketu de Ians\u00e3\" was first used by Moura in the doctoral ceremony honoris- cause of Gilberto Gil at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. After that, Moura used the theme in a play in Vienna, Austria, at the University of Musicology. A year later, he showed the theme for Daniela, who did not know and she immediately wanted to record it to launch in the Carnival. In 2009, Rolling Stone Brasil magazine named Daniela as one of the 100 greatest artists of Brazilian music of all time. The names chosen by the expert jury, only 16 were women. Finally in November 2009, Daniela released the album entitled Canib\u00e1lia. The album marks her return to the studio after five years. The recording sessions for the album takes almost three years to be done, Canib\u00e1lia hit stores with five different covers \u2013 a Gringo Cardia project. And five different track lists for the album, according to the singer, is an extensive project that combines music, dance, video and plastic arts \u2013 various expressions of art covered by it. Daniela Mercury has said that \"Canib\u00e1lia is an embrace, a swallow of Tropic\u00e1lia, the Clube da Esquina and everything that has since been created in the arts in Brazil since the \u2013 \u2018Semana de 22\u2019 [\u2018Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922 \u2019-The Week of Modern Art] \u2013 I yearn for the liberty that comes from this anthropophagic movement, of the Cannibalist Manifesto by Oswald de Andrade and its practice by Mario [de Andrade), who spoke that these mixtures reinforce our [Brazilian] identity\". Jos\u00e9 Oswald de Andrade Souza (1890 \u2013 October 1954) was a Brazilian poet and a controversial thinker. Born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Andrade was one of the founders of the Brazilian Modernist movement and a member of the Group of Five, including M\u00e1rio de Andrade, Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral Oswald de Andrade]. Andrade is recognized by his nationalist, Manifesto Antrop\u00f3fago (Cannibalist Manifesto), published in 1928. The manifesto argues that based on the premise that the history of Brazil has, as its greatest strength, the power to cannibalize others and simultaneously plays with the idea of cannibalism as a modern primitivism; like a presumed tribal rite. Cannibalism then, becomes a way for Brazil to reaffirm itself against the cultural domination of Post Colonial Europe. The iconic phrase of the manifesto \"Tupi or not Tupi\" is as much a celebration of the Tupinamba, a documented tribe of cannibals, as it is an act of genius cannibalizing Shakespeare's, \"To be or not to be\". In 2009, her tour named by the album title started in S\u00e3o Paulo, and traveled to several Brazilian cities and abroad. The work pays tribute to Carmen Miranda, at her centenary, with songs like \"Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1\" and \"O Que \u00c9 Que A Baiana Tem?\". For 2010's Carnival, Daniela Mercury recorded \"Andarilho Encantado\", song released officially in the special project of the singer called P\u00f4r do Som (Sunset Sound), the show that brings Mercury as headliner each year on the first day of the year at the Farol da Barra, in Salvador, Bahia. The song was written by Mercury and Marcelo Quintanilha. Also in 2010, the year that the Electric Trio celebrates 60 years and Ax\u00e9 Music 25 years, the singer reaches 20 years of solo career \u2013 with significant-selling records. To commemorate the date, the media raised the possibility it make a documentary film about this invention of Bahian carnival, the ax\u00e9 music, praising percussionists. In February 2013, the singer was invited to be interviewed in the Leading Women program of CNN International, and was announced by the issuer as the \"Brazilian Madonna\". The attraction highlights the most influential women in the world in their fields. Already in 2012, the Bahian singer had attracted the attention of American writer and feminist Camille Paglia, who declared to the British newspaper The Independent, that had a \"crush\" by the Bahian star. Since she had been in the country, for a conference in Bahia, Paglia has written enthusiastic articles about Mercury, saying that Daniela Mercury is the artist who's Madonna wanted to be. Paglia said, a Canadian television station, which is \"in love with a Brazilian superstar. I'm watching her work. She is Daniela Mercury. In fact, this has been very important. This is the point where I am in my life\" . In an interview with the Brazilian magazine Veja, intellectual revealed her plans to write two books about the Bahian singer. At the end of 2013, released the album Daniela Mercury & Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos, a partnership with the Brazilian group Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos, with songs like \"Couch\u00e9\", \"Alma Feminina\", \"Paula e Bebeto\", \"Aquele Abra\u00e7o\" and \"Cheia de Gra\u00e7a\" are some of the tracks are presented in this work. It is an urban and pop-rock album, which does not show Daniela's rhythmic signature; it was launched with a book called \"Daniela and Malu, A Love Story\", a partnership with her wife Malu Ver\u00e7osa. The book tells the story of their relationship, from the moment of friendship to marriage. ===The Voice Kids and Vinil Virtual (2014\u2013present)=== In 2014, she was mentor on The Voice Kids (the version for children of the traditional show The Voice) of Portugal, because of her popularity in Portuguese lands. In the same year she released the single \"A Rainha do Ax\u00e9 (Rainha M\u00e1)\", an electronic ijex\u00e1 that speaks about the strength of women, love and faith which was sung by revelers during the 2015's Carnival of Salvador. The single is the first single to the fifteenth studio album by the singer titled Vinil Virtual, released November 27, 2015 by the label Biscoito Fino. ==Personal life== Mercury and her wife Malu Ver\u00e7osa participating in a seminar LGBT in the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia. In 1984, at 19, Mercury married electronic engineer Zalther Portela Laborda P\u00f3voas, her high school boyfriend. The next year, on September 3, 1985, she gave birth to their first child, Gabriel (who is also a singer and songwriter). The following year, she gave birth to a girl named Giovana (who is now a dancer in Mercury's ensemble). In 1996, Mercury and P\u00f3voas divorced. That same year, she was pointed as the reason for the split between Chico Buarque and Marieta Severo. In an interview to ISTO\u00c9 magazine, Mercury said that \"it was a levity what they did, an irresponsibility that caused an uproar in my life and in the lives of both of them\". In April 2013 Daniela Mercury used social media to make public her relationship with the journalist Malu Ver\u00e7osa, saying that \"Malu is now my wife, my family, my inspiration to sing.\" Daniela Mercury and Malu Ver\u00e7osa married on October 12, 2013 in a civil ceremony in Salvador da Bahia, both dressed in all white. Her father, initially critical about their relationship, was present.Daniela Mercury se casa no civil com Malu Ver\u00e7osa, CARAS Online, October 12, 2013. ==Controversies== At late 2005, Mercury, a devout Catholic, was uninvited from a Christmas concert in the Vatican City due to her endorsement of a Ministry of Health campaign encouraging young people to use condoms. Church officials feared she would use the occasion to promote the use of condoms. In 2006, Mercury openly opposed to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's reelection. This has drawn criticism from other artists, such as Zeca Baleiro, who accused her of being favored by the late Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es, a controversial oligarch from Bahia (which she denied vehemently). Later that same year, in an interview to Folha de S.Paulo, Mercury declared she was against reelections in general. She also said to have voted for Lula four times and that she was disappointed \"by his first term (...), shocked with all these scandals\". However, she said to hope that \"Brazil will now have the four years of Lula that we hoped it would be in the first term.\" ==Philanthropy== Mercury has performed at a large number of charitable events. She is the second Brazilian honored as an ambassador for UNICEF (Renato Arag\u00e3o was the first). She is also an ambassador for UNAIDS and UNESCO.
