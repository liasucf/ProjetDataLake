    "text": "Marko Vrzgula (born 24 February 1966, Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia) is a Slovak painter and organiser of exhibitions and symposiums for painters. He is one of the founding members of the association The Blue Pears [Modr\u00e9 Hru\u0161ky] (1988). Vrzgula is the author of the concept of the gallery GUBA http://www.guba.sk/index.php?x=about (2004) as well as its manager. GUBA comprises nine individual venues altogether \u2013 amounting to approximately 2 400 m\u00b2 of exhibition area. GUBA is an authentic space of contemporary architecture where the exhibited artworks communicate with people and the environment in their everyday reality. More than 50 Slovak and Czech artists have held long- term exhibitions of their works here. Since 2004 Vrzgula is a freelance artist. He lives and workshttp://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=2370 in Bratislava and in the village of L\u00fa\u010dky \u2013 near Ru\u017eomberok, located in the Liptov region. == Studies and pedagogical career == Vrzgula attended and then graduated from the Department of Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava in the years 1985 \u2013 1991. Between the years 1992 and 2002 Vrzgula was a pedagogue at the Department of Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava (Introduction to painting and drawing for 1st \u2013 5th year students). From 2002 \u2013 until 2004 he taught at the Department of Creative Arts and Art Education at the Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra. == Exhibitions == Since the year 1988 Vrzgula has presented his work at more than twenty solo exhibitions in Slovakia (Bratislava, Martin, Poprad, Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves, Ko\u0161ice, \u017dilina, Doln\u00fd Kub\u00edn,http://www.oravskagaleria.sk/english_version.html Zvolen, Senica), but also abroad, in the French H\u00e9genheim and in Herzliya (Israel). He also participated at more than fifty collective exhibitions, among them also exhibitions in Vienna, St. P\u00f6lten and in Horn (Austria), in Warsaw and in Poznan (Poland), in Munich and Bruckm\u00fchl (Germany), in Novi Sad (the former Yugoslavia), in Washington (USA), in Sofia (Bulgaria), in Cagnes-sur-Mer (France), in London (Great Britain), in the Czech republic and in Slovakia.http://vrzgula-art.guba.sk/mainwin.html Vrzgula also participated at an international symposium in the Austrian town of Horn, at a symposium of large format paintings in Doln\u00fd Kub\u00edn (2 times), at a painters\u2019 symposium in Moravany nad V\u00e1hom, at the program Artists-in-Residence \u2013 Jelen\u00ed Studio in Prague, at the plein air painting in Mal\u00e1 Frankov\u00e1 (2 times). Since the year 2010 Vrzgula has been organising the symposium L\u00fa\u010dky (4 times).http://kultura.sme.sk/c/6593043/nove-vystavy.html == Painting artwork == Vrzgula\u2019s work developed into and persists in a multi-layered range of contents and forms. He is a classic artist who spontaneously reacts to everyday life impulses and does not pose any conceptual filters between himself and the world. Straightforwardness is his concept and also the most suitable word used to describe his approach to motif. Only once this motif is brought into his coloured laboratory does Vrzgula start his artistic research on it. It\u2019s uncompromising, authentic and radical and the outcome is usually on the verge of an abstract painting. His paintings are known for their characteristic strong paint-gestures that are created by different means of applying the coloured medium (with a roller, frottage, dripping, spatula, haptic inputs...) He works in longer cycles that go on for a number years. He abstracted the figure in his thesis Windows (Okn\u00e1, 1990-1991). A rotating foam cylinder defined the stripe compositions of the years long cycle Intersections (Prieniky,1993-2000).http://www.webumenia.sk/cedvuweb/image/SVK_OGD.O_2013.jpeg?id=SVK:OGD.O_2013http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=44 He used a similar artistic approach of the repetition of horizontal lines also in his subsequent cycle Bridges (Mosty, 2004-2011)http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=3 \u2013 where he achieved a staccato style grid from imprints of real wooden boards and pieces on the painting. Another one of Vrzgula\u2019s cycle is Movements and Spirals (Pohyby a \u0160pir\u00e1ly, 2006-2012),http://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=1193 where we see the coloured pastes become more and more dominant and thus create a pre-step for the latest years-long cycle of Vrzgula called Pulsars (Pulzary, 2011-2015).http://www.guba.sk/images/20140311143654_marko%20vrzgula%20-%20pulzary%202013%2002.jpghttp://www.guba.sk/index.php?showimage=2028 Vrzgula keeps on improving his own recipe for acryl that is able to carry an extreme amount of colour paste. This allows him to create haptic reliefs full of coloured messages. He models them with his fingers and they can be perceived also through the touch of one\u2019s hands. This is how Vrzgula physically takes direct part in the creation of the composition without using any tools. The most significant part of such a creation is most probably the actual process \u2013 the work and movement of the author on the surface of the painting. Although Vrzgula\u2019s paintings are created through a carefully set up process, it is still just a gesture \u2013 that revives a coloured mass and that gives each shape its own, unique character. Before every one of his compositions Vrzgula creates a sketch which on its own is very interesting and of a high artistic quality. It could well be presented as an artwork itself. In Vrzgula\u2019s latest works these sketches are seeing a change. From being drawn on small paper surfaces they are now sketched on large canvases and their restless, vibrant line structure defines not only the core of the composition but also the whole surface of the painting. == External links == * Vrzgula: online selection of paintings from his artwork * POL\u010cAS | PRINTEMPS | PRIME TIME exhibition in Tatra gallery Poprad, 2015 * SME.sk: Marko Vrzgula: \"Art is for those who want to perceive it\" * Jozef Baus a Marko Vrzgula: Connection in the gallery SPP 01 *Baus-Vrzgula = Allies * Pravda.sk: Marko Vrzgula a Jozef Baus are allies * Marko Vrzgula: I burn for a while, I smoulder for a while * Jozef Baus a Marko Vrzgula: Allies * Marko Vrzgula: Pulsars * Slovenskecentrum.sk: Painter Marko Vrzgula will hold his debut exhibition in Israel ==References== Slovak painter Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:Abstract painters Category:Slovak artists ",
