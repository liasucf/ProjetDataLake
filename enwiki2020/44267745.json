    "text": "Steve Nelmark is an American mixed martial artist. He competed in the Heavyweight division. ==Nelmarking== Steve Nelmark is perhaps most well known for his spectacular knockout loss to David Abbott. In it, he was crumpled underneath the cage, his legs bent under him, prompting audience members to shout \"he dead.\" Since then, the act of getting knocked out in a similar spectacular fashion (with the key components being the legs tucked underneath, and the slump over the cage), has been called Nelmarking. Well known UFC fighters that have Nelmarked are Rashad Evans in his loss to Lyoto Machida, Thomas Almeida's knockout of Anthony Birchak and recently Jimi Manuwa's nelmarking of Ovince St. Preux at UFC 204. At UFC on Fox 28, Alan Jouban's knockout of Ben Saunders was noted as a fenceless Nelmarking. ==Mixed martial arts record== |- | Loss | align=center| 2\u20131 | David Abbott | KO (punch) | UFC: Ultimate Ultimate 1996 | | align=center| 1 | align=center| 1:03 | Birmingham, Alabama, United States | |- | Win | align=center| 2\u20130 | Marcus Bossett | Submission (choke) | UFC: Ultimate Ultimate 1996 | | align=center| 1 | align=center| 1:37 | Birmingham, Alabama, United States | |- | Win | align=center| 1\u20130 | Tai Bowden | TKO (doctor stoppage) | UFC 9: Motor City Madness | | align=center| 1 | align=center| 7:25 | Detroit, Michigan, United States | ==See also== *List of male mixed martial artists ==References== ==External links== * * * Steve Nelmark at mixedmartialarts.com Category:American male mixed martial artists Category:Heavyweight mixed martial artists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
