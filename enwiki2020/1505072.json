    "text": "Oblique view from Apollo 15, facing north, and centered on Mons Piton. The craters Piton A and Piton B are visible near center and to the right, and Piton Gamma (\u03b3) is in the foreground. Mons Piton is an isolated lunar mountain that is located in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium, to the north- northwest of the crater Aristillus. Due east of Mons Piton is the flooded crater Cassini, and to the west-northwest lies Piazzi Smyth. North and northeast of this massif is the Montes Alpes range, forming the northeast edge of the lunar mare. The selenographic coordinates of this rise are 40.6\u00b0 N, 1.1\u00b0 W, and it has a diameter of 25 km. It is slightly elongated along toward the northwest, with ridge lines to the south, northwest, and west. The peak climbs to a height of 2250 m, typical of the peaks in the Montes Alpes, but much lower than Mons Blanc, which rises to 3.6 km. Because it is an isolated formation on the lunar mare, this peak can form prominent shadows when illuminated by oblique sunlight during the lunar dawn or dusk. It is also known as a location of Transient Lunar Anomalies. The peak of Piton is cratered from a meteor strike, though the crater can be difficult to observe from earthbound telescopes. There is a pair of satellite craters on the mare to the south that are named for this peak (see below). To the south-southwest is a low ridge feature in an isolated portion of the mare that is designated Piton Gamma (\u03b3). Mons Piton was named for a peak on Tenerife Island. The lunar Mons Piton is located in a range known as the Montes Teneriffe. Mons Piton, from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data, with elevation line across the peak (elevation from line left to right.) ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mons Piton. Both Piton A and B are to the south of Mons Piton. {|class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" |Piton !width=\"25%\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|A |align=\"center\"|39.8\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|1.0\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|6 km |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|39.3\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|0.1\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|5 km |} ==References== ==External links== * Exposed Layers within Piton B crater ==See also== * List of mountains on the Moon by height Category:Mountains on the Moon Category:Mare Imbrium ",
