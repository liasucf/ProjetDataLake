It was first exhibited at the 1861 Paris Salon alongside The Spanish Singer. It was initially owned by the painter's brother Eug\u00e8ne before passing to Ernest Rouart's wife Julie Manet. In 1977, ten years after Julie's death, the Rouart-Manet family donated it to the French state, which moved it from the galerie du Jeu de Paume to the mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in 1985, where it still hangs. ==References== Manet Category:Paintings of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Category:1860 paintings ",
