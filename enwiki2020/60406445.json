She is a former member of the tART Collective and the Corpus VI Collective. == Education == Haynes holds a BA in Film from Temple University, a CFA in Painting from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and an MFA in Painting from Brooklyn College. == Work == Haynes' work focuses heavily on the human body, she believes the moles, wrinkles, stretch marks, veins and such on our bodies are landmarks of our journey through our lives. Her themes often include aging, illness, and mortality. Her work pushes the social conventions of beauty, femininity, as well as gender and sexuality. Haynes\u2019 most controversial work is The Breast Portrait Project, portraying the nude female torso complete with wrinkles and blemishes, in the opposite style from a glamour portrait. The absence of a face compels the viewer to detect character and personality from these less-familiar indicators. This project initially began with a self portrait of her own torso in order to confront her own image issues. After feeling empowered by the portrait, Haynes began doing more of these portraits for friends and soon for complete strangers at festivals. Clarity explains: \u201cI am interested in the many ways the body changes throughout a lifetime, and in the ways in which we create and change our bodies.\u201d She even kept record and pictures of each sitter in handmade books for the project full of the women she painted to help heal just like she had. This project was very big in the LGBTQ and feminist communities of the 90s. == Exhibitions == Haynes has had solo exhibitions at Brandeis University's Kniznick Gallery, Payne Gallery at Moravian College, Stout Projects, Bogigian Gallery at Wilson College, and Artists' House Gallery. Her work was included in The Outwin 2016: American Portraiture Today at the National Portrait Gallery, which traveled to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, the Tacoma Art Museum, the Ackland Art Museum and the Art Museum of South Texas. She has participated in many group exhibitions, including at the Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Rutgers University's Paul Robeson Galleries, Invisible-Exports Gallery, Mana Contemporary, and the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art. == Recognition == Haynes has received numerous awards, including a Pollock- Krasner Foundation award, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Painting, a MacDowell Fellowship, a Brooklyn Arts Council/New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Community Regrant Award, a Leeway Foundation Window of Opportunity Grant, and a Barbara Deming Memorial Fund Grant.Haynes' work has been discussed in many publications, including the Washington Post, Hyperallergic, Two Coats of Paint, Juxtapoz Magazine, Beautiful Decay Magazine, and the Huffington Post, among others.
