Its primary focus is to inspire greater understanding and stewardship of nature through the art of photography. ==History and profile== Launched as an annual publication in 1995 by current editor-in-chief and publisher Stephen B. Freligh, Nature's Best Photography is published semi-annually on high-quality glossy oversized paper. In 1996, the Nature's Best International Photography Awards (now the Nature's Best Photography Windland Smith Rice International Photography Awards) was created as an annual competition to recognize outstanding nature photography and foster the efforts of photographers worldwide, as well as further conservation awareness. Past winners and honorees of the competition include Rodney Lough Jr., Jeremy Woodhouse, Fritz P\u00f6lking, Kevin Schafer, Howard G. Buffett and Thorsten Milse.
