    "text": "Ryan Joseph \"Archie\" Miller (born October 30, 1978) is an American college basketball coach and former player. He currently coaches the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. Miller played point guard for North Carolina State from 1998 to 2002 and ended his career among the school's leaders in free-throw percentage, three-point field goal percentage, and total three-pointers. From 2011 to 2017 he was the head coach for the University of Dayton and won the conference regular season championship in 2016 and 2017. Miller was named the Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year in 2017. ==Early years and playing career== Miller was born and raised in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, just northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His given name is \"Ryan\" but garnered the nickname \"Archie\" at an early age due to his personality being similar to that of Archie Bunker, the grouchy TV character, from All in the Family. Miller grew up in a basketball family. Both he and his older brother Sean Miller played for their father, John Miller, a former coach at Blackhawk High School, who went 657\u2013280 in a 35-year coaching career, including 104\u201329 in the postseason, before retiring in 2005. He won eight Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League championships, the second most in history, and four Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association titles. Miller noted how much he learned from his father, saying, \"He's really teaching you how to be a coach, and you don't even realize it. He knew what hard work was. He knew what dedication was. He knew what preparation was. He knew how to communicate. It starts to come naturally to you. It's all you do. It's all you're around, and it's all you talk about.\u201d In addition to his father's connection to the game, Miller's brother, Sean, was a point guard who went on to play the position at Pitt and is currently the head coach of the Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team. Archie views Sean, who is 10 years older, as more of a mentor than a rival. Sean, then an assistant at North Carolina State University, recruited Archie to play as a point guard. Sean later also hired Archie as an assistant at Arizona when he got the job in 2009. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up in the house together two years apart and the backyard,\u201d Archie said. \u201c... I basically look at him sort of as the role model, the guy whom to be like, the guy who to call when you need something, the one that helped you get to where you wanted to get to.\" Miller's sister, Lisa, also played Division I basketball at Toledo and Elon. Following high school, Miller played point guard for North Carolina State from 1998 to 2002. As a senior, he helped lead the Wolfpack to the finals of the ACC championship game and was named to the all-tournament team. He finished his career there with an 84.6% free-throw percentage, a 42.9 three-point field goal percentage, and 218 three-pointers, which were all marks that ranked in the top 10 in school history.\"Archie Miller\". daytonflyers.com.

Retrieved March 22, 2014. ==Coaching career== ===Assistant coaching positions (2003\u20132011)=== Miller spent time at several programs as an assistant coach, spending a season at Western Kentucky (2003\u201304), two at NC State (2004\u20132006), one at Arizona State (2006\u201307) under former coach Herb Sendek, two at Ohio State (2007\u201309) under Thad Matta, and two at Arizona (2009\u201311) under his brother Sean. While at Arizona, Miller shined as a top recruiter, helping secure Arizona's top 10 recruiting class for 2011 recruits. He also excelled as a game strategist and designed the Wildcats' upset of eighth-ranked Texas to get them to the Sweet 16. ===University of Dayton (2011\u20132017)=== Miller became the head coach of the Dayton Flyers men's basketball team in 2011 and turned around a program that had back-to-back disappointing seasons. His first season with Dayton saw Miller take the school to 20 wins. In his third year, 2014, he had the Flyers in the Elite Eight with 26 wins; to get there, Dayton upset three higher seeded teams. After the Elite Eight run in 2014, Miller faced replacing three starters and four seniors from that team. Despite having a depleted roster featuring just six players who were recruited to Dayton and no active player taller than 6-foot-6, Miller led his Flyers to a 27-9 overall record and to the third round of the 2015 NCAA tournament. In the following three seasons, Miller averaged over 25 wins and each year coached the team made to the NCAA tournament. The latter two the Flyers also earned regular season Atlantic 10 champion titles. The Flyers' 78 wins in from 2013-16 matched the best three-year period in school history. Due to his coaching abilities, Miller was named a finalist for the 2015 Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award. In April, 2015, he joined his father and brother in the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame. ===Indiana University (2017\u2013present)=== On March 27, 2017, Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. Miller's first season involved rebuilding the program and laying the foundation of a pack- line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense and 25% offense.https://247sports.com/college/indiana/Article/Transcript-Archie- Miller-at-IU-media-day-108128981 With an early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten Tournament and no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or NIT, Indiana's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close with an overall record of 16\u201315 and 9\u20139 in the Big Ten. Nevertheless, Miller got off to an impressive recruiting start, including the commitment of five star recruit Romeo Langford, a McDonald's-All American, 2018 Indiana Mr. Basketball, and (according to ESPN) the 6th ranked player in the nation. Despite getting off to a strong start of 12\u20132, including 3 conference wins, the 2018\u20132019 Hoosiers struggled down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and poor shooting, Indiana lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a 4-game winning streak. Indiana failed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament but earned a 1-seed in the NIT, where they advanced far before losing in the quarterfinals, ending the season with an overall record of 19\u201316 and 8\u201312 in the Big Ten. ==Coaching philosophy== Miller employs a structured transition offense intended to open up games, create foul trouble for opponents, and score before the defense can get set. His offensive approach has been called \"one of the most complete transition offensive systems you will find.\" He frequently uses a \"Phoenix fast break\" with players pushing the ball off of rebounds and turnovers in a flexible system that can take on a variety of alignments. He will modify the Phoenix break based on personnel to accommodate five guards or two post players on the floor at once. If an opponent scores, Miller employs a \"Carolina transition offense\" to create scoring opportunities which flow right into a motion offense. The identity of Miller's teams are rooted in defense. He employs a \"pack line defense,\" which is a variation of man-to-man defense invented by Dick Bennett at Wisconsin and also employed by Tony Bennett at Virginia and Tom Izzo at Michigan State, among others.Archie Miller Committed to Defense, accessed December 3, 2017 Instead of the off-ball defenders pressuring their player and denying the pass, everyone except the player guarding the ball must be inside an imaginary line 16 feet from the rim. At all times a defender pressures the player with the basketball, while the other four defenders play in gap/help positions. However, if the offensive player picks up the dribble, all players go out and deny looking for the steal. The pack line defense is intended to discourage penetration, getting inside the paint, and forces opponents to win with a well executed offense and good outside shooting. ==Personal== While attending NC State, Miller met Morgan Nicole (n\u00e9e Cruse), who was also a student and athlete for the Wolfpack. Morgan was on the NC State track and field team. The couple dated during college and tied the knot in 2003. In 2004, they had a daughter, Leah Grace. His brother Sean Miller is the head basketball coach at the University of Arizona. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Indiana profile Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball coaches Category:Arizona Wildcats men's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Pennsylvania Category:Basketball players from Pennsylvania Category:Dayton Flyers men's basketball coaches Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball coaches Category:NC State Wolfpack men's basketball coaches Category:NC State Wolfpack men's basketball players Category:Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball coaches Category:People from Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area Category:Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball coaches ",
