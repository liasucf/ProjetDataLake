David and Urs are tenors, along with the baritone Carlos, they have long careers in the world of opera and classical music start from early vocal training. In contrast, S\u00e9bastien has not had any prior professional musical training (was self-taught), and is a tenor voice which the group classes as vox populi due to his pop tone. Piano keyboard indicating the typical tenor. Piano keyboard indicating the typical baritone. * Urs, Tenor, most likely a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach features in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice might or might not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes.Tenor#Heldentenor This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: the extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5. * S\u00e9bastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, so it has a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of this voice type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training. S\u00e9bastien's voice is distinguished by its clear and bright timbre, the pectoral resonance and firmness in voice projection. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to B4. * Carlos, Verdi baritone. Incorporating the deep tones that a bass has, while having an upper range approaching that of a tenor, Carlos' voice type is high even for a usual baritone. A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range, up to A4, sometimes even up to the B\u266d4.Baritone#Verdi The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G\u266d2 up to B\u266d4. The *unofficial* sheet music for their first album claims he sings down to a D2, however this is atypical of a baritone. Most basses would not even be required to sing such notes. During the Live at The Greek Theatre concert, he hit B4 singing I Believe in You. * David, lyric tenor. The lyric tenor is a warm graceful voice with a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy and can be heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from approximately the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5).Tenor#Lyric The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from C3 up to E5. A very quick, falsettoed F5 can be heard on their first album in the song Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui. ===Styling=== Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their flawless, refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by Giorgio Armani;Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni, and costumes and accessories: William Hunt, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Tom Ford and Gucci. ===Musical style=== Creating Il Divo created a revolution within the pure genre of opera because their musical combination of opera singing and classical music (opera), with themes of different genres, including Latin, folk, ballads, church music, bolero and pop. But his lyrical voices kept playing emblematic songs, it is not synonymous with opera, nor pop. There is talk of an intermediate term, but not of a merger between the two, since such lines that can not be merged, as David describes himself: So we talk about a new invention of musical style, hand own quartet, called Opera-Pop o P\u00f3pera, classified in the genre of contemporary music- ===Multilingual=== The quartet records their songs in several languages Spanish (\"Regresa A Mi\", \"Hasta Mi Final\", \"La Vida Sin Amor\"), English (\"Mama\", \"Amazing Grace\", \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\"), Italian (\"Senza Parole\", \"Passera\", \"Notte Di Luce\"), French (\"Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,\" \"Le Temps des Cathedrales\"), one in Latin (\"Panis Angelicus\") and a few in Portuguese(\"Volta Pra Mim\") and Japanese (\"Furusato\"). Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song: \"The Man You Love\" (Spanish & English), \"Ave Maria\" (Italian & Latin), \"I Believe In You\" (English & French) are recorded this way; whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: \"She\" (Italian & English) and \"Bring Him Home\" (English & Spanish). Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as they themselves say that \"Spanish is the language of Romanticism\". ==Other activities== ===Philanthropy=== On 25 April 2007, Il Divo performed on American Idol in one of the \"Idol Gives Back\" episodes, which raised money for children in the US and Africa. For every vote cast during that show, Idol sponsors Coca-Cola, AT&T;, and others donated money to Charity Projects Entertainment Fund (CPEF) and other groups such as Save the Children and America's Second Harvest. In 2011, they recorded the carol \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" to raise money for the organisation Save the Children. Il Divo is related indirectly in terms of sponsorship and help with the French NGO SMTA Assistance M\u00e9dicale Toit du Monde since 2005, of which S\u00e9bastien is the international official sponsor, and with Sanfilippo Children's Foundation in which S\u00e9bastien's global ambassador. 20\u201330 September 2015, David Miller and Urs B\u00fchler rode on motorbikes all in the name of charity. We are planning to ride across America on a 2800-mile journey from Miami to LA to raise funds for the brilliant Nordoff Robbins music therapy charity. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Il Divo (2004) * Ancora (2006) * Siempre (2006) * The Promise (2008) * Wicked Game (2011) * A Musical Affair (2013) * Amor & Pasi\u00f3n (2015) * Timeless (2018) ==Videography== ==See also== * Il Divo videography * Il Divo discography ==References== ==Bibliography== *Allegra Rossi, Romancing The World, Hardback 128 pages, 10 November 2005, Orion publishers () *Il Divo, Our Music, Our Journey, Our Words, Paperback 192 pages, 6 September 2007, Headline Book Publishing () ==External links== * IlDivo.com Official Website Il Divo Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Opera crossover singers Category:Musical quartets Category:Sony BMG artists Category:Vocal quartets Category:Ballad music groups ",
