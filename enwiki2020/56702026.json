As a long-standing member of the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's main opposition party, he was chosen to be the DA's candidate for mayor of the City of Tshwane in 2011.http://www.politicsweb.co.za/iservice/the-da-mayoral-candidates-for- joburg-tshwane--zill The governing ANC retained the metro, however. Topham thereafter led the DA opposition in the Tshwane council. After standing unsuccessfully to be the party's mayoral candidate again in 2016, Topham instead became a Member of the South African Parliament for the DA and served as Deputy Shadow Minister of The Auditor General, and The Deputy Shadow Minister of Appropriations. In October 2016 Topham criticised Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba and suggested that there is more to the South African Revenue Service's collection shortfall of R50.8 Billion and that \"There may be a rolling of payment and collection. I suggest you do a performance appraisal for senior SARS officials and see if they\u2019ve reported truthfully.\" In 2018, Topham resigned from parliament. ==Freemasonry== Topham has been named grand treasurer of the Grand Lodge of South Africa in 2015. He is currently listed as Secretary of Lodge Koh-I-Noor no 79 in Pretoria. In March 2016 the Freemasons were accused of influencing the Democratic Alliance's candidate list. Topham dismissed these claims and stated \"The Freemasons are not a secret society and do not take oaths. Some people who do not believe all men are created equal, use it as a bogeyman, as the Broederbond did in the previous dispensation\" He further mentioned that only about 30 public representatives nationwide are Freemasons. ==Forensic Accounting== The forensic report detailing how R1,4 Billion disappeared during the Fidentia Scandal, a Ponzi Scheme, was co-compiled by Topham. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Chief financial officers Category:University of South Africa alumni Category:South African lawyers Category:Democratic Alliance (South Africa) politicians ",
