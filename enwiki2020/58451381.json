    "text": "DaVinci Resolve (originally known as da Vinci Resolve) is a color correction and non-linear video editing (NLE) application for macOS, Windows, and Linux, originally developed by da Vinci Systems, and now developed by Blackmagic Design following its acquisition in 2009. In addition to the commercial version of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve Studio), Blackmagic Design also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality, simply named DaVinci Resolve (formerly known as DaVinci Resolve Lite). == Development == === Original da Vinci Systems development (2003\u20132009) === The initial versions of DaVinci Resolve (known then as da Vinci Resolve) were resolution- independent software tools, developed by da Vinci Systems (based in Coral Springs, Florida), who had previously produced other color correction systems, such as da Vinci Classic (1985), da Vinci Renaissance (1990), and da Vinci 2K (1998). The system was first announced in 2003 and released in 2004. It began with three possible configurations: a digital intermediate (DI) color correction tool (known as Resolve DI), a visual effects tool (known as Resolve FX), and a 2K resolution processing tool (known as Resolve RT). These initial versions were integrated exclusively into dedicated hardware controllers. The systems leveraged parallel processing in an InfiniBand topology to support performance during color grading. This was initially implemented using proprietary hardware cards; however, the 4K resolution Resolve R series (such as the R-100, introduced in 2008, and the stereoscopic 3D R-360-3D, introduced in 2009) replaced this proprietary hardware with CUDA-based NVIDIA GPUs. In 2009, the Australian video processing and distribution technology company Blackmagic Design bought da Vinci Systems, retaining and expanding the engineering team for Resolve, but eliminating support-based contracts for the tool. In October 2009, Blackmagic Design CEO Grant Petty speculated in an interview that the price of Resolve could likely be reduced to below $100,000. === Blackmagic Design versions (2010\u2013present) === At NAB 2010 in Las Vegas, in April 2010, Blackmagic Design announced three new pricing models for Resolve, with a new software-only macOS version retailing for $995, the macOS version with the Advanced Control Surface (previously branded as Impresario by da Vinci Systems) retailing for $29,995, and licenses for the Linux version (supporting multiple-GPUs for increased performance) retailing at $19,995 (with the most advanced configuration available retailing for under $150,000). Before this change, the pre-built versions of Resolve had been the only available options, selling for between $200,000 and $800,000, which was common industry practice at the time. In September 2010, version 7 (restyled as DaVinci Resolve) was the first to be released by Blackmagic Design under the new pricing model, and the first release for macOS. It included a redesigned user interface, Apple ProRes support, and support for the RED Rocket digital video decoder boards manufactured by Red Digital Cinema. The pricing model changes continued in June 2011 with the release of version 8: As part of this new version, Blackmagic Design announced a free, reduced-functionality edition of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve 8 Lite), alongside the continuing commercial options. Version 8 also introduced OpenCL acceleration support and XML integration with non-linear editor (NLE) applications. Subsequently, version 8.2 (December 2011) further expanded the scope of the software (which was previously only available for macOS and Linux) with the first release for the Windows platform, beginning with a public beta. Version 9 (2012) included redesigned user interface elements, added metadata editing options, and expanded the range of cameras and file types supported. The following year, version 10 was released, increasing the amount of information imported from XML, AAF and EDL files, and adding OpenFX plug-in, JPEG 2000 and AVI support. Version 10 was also the first version to include basic video editing features alongside the color correction functionality, such as the trimming of clips. Released in August 2014, version 11 added audio mixing, media organization features, and further video editing features, thereby enabling the software to function as a standalone non-linear editor (NLE) for the first time, in addition to integrating with other NLEs. DaVinci Resolve version 12 Subsequently, version 12 (announced at NAB 2015) added a new audio engine (supporting VST/AU plug-ins), and version 14 (2016) added an integrated version of audio editing software previously developed by Fairlight (following Blackmagic Design's acquisition of the company during the same year). The first version of Resolve for standard editions of Linux (version 12.5.5) was made available in 2017. This was also the first version in which a free Resolve version for Linux became available. Previous versions had required a custom build of Linux, use of the DaVinci Resolve Advanced hardware control panel, and a dedicated license dongle. Released in 2018, version 15 added an integrated version of the Fusion compositing and visual effects application, which was first developed in 1987 and had been acquired by Blackmagic Design in 2014. Blackmagic Design officially announced DaVinci Resolve version 16 at NAB 2019, in April 2019. Features introduced in version 16 include a dedicated 'Cut' page (to provide a more streamlined alternative to the 'Edit' page), machine learning functionality (Studio edition only) to handle repetitive tasks (e.g. facial recognition to sort clips by person), 3D audio within Fairlight, and new collaboration features (including Frame.io integration). The initial beta of version 16 was made available on the announcement date, and the final version of 16.0 was made available on 08 August 2019, alongside a beta for version 16.1. == Functionality == The software includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing/effects (including Fairlight), and visual effects (including Fusion). It can either be used as an intermediary between other NLE software and Digital Cinema Package (DCP) creation software, or as a standalone end-to-end video editing application. For content delivery to services such as Netflix, Resolve provides functionality to create and validate IMF (Interoperable Master Format, standardized by SMPTE) packages, known as IMPs (which comprise multiple components, such as MXF content, a composition playlist (CPL), and XML package data), without the use of separate DCP software. Compatible file formats include video formats such as AVI, MP4, QuickTime, DNxHD, and XAVC; data exchange formats such as XML, EDL, AAF, DCP, MXF, and CinemaDNG; audio formats such as AAC, AIFF, and WAVE; and image formats such as RAW, OpenEXR, TIFF, DPX, R3D, JPEG, and JPEG 2000. Supported plug-in types include OpenFX, VST, and AU. As of version 12.2 (December 2015), Resolve includes support for the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) standard for a high dynamic range. Other supported capabilities include OpenCL and Intel Quick Sync Video. === Studio edition === Unlike the free edition, the commercial edition of the software (DaVinci Resolve Studio) also supports resolutions greater than ultra-high-definition and frame-rates greater than 60 FPS. Other aspects of functionality only available in the commercial edition include support for multiple GPUs, additional OpenFX plug-ins (such as Face Tracking and Lens Flare), stereoscopic grading, video noise reduction, motion blur, HDR color grading, and user collaboration tools. The Studio edition is also the only edition to include the machine learning functions introduced as part of Resolve version 16. === Fairlight integration === Since version 14 (2016) DaVinci Resolve includes an integrated version of the software developed by Fairlight (now owned by Blackmagic Design), designed for TV & Film post-production, and live audio mixing. The Resolve-integrated software supports up to 1000 audio tracks, with a maximum of 6 inserts and 24 aux-sends per track. Other functionality includes 96-channel audio recording and 3D audio mixing for formats such as 5.1, 7.1 and 22.2. Integrated audio tools include compression/expansion, limiting, gating and parametric EQ. Fairlight software has been used in the production of TV shows, advertisements, and feature films, such as Logan and Murder on the Orient Express. === Fusion integration === Since version 15 (2018), DaVinci Resolve also includes an integrated version of the Fusion application for compositing and visual effects, also developed by Blackmagic Design. The core functionality of Fusion is based on a modular, node-based interface, with each node forming one specific aspect of the overall effects being implemented. This same interface style is present in the Resolve-integrated version. Prior to integration with Resolve, the standalone version of Fusion was used in the creation of effects for over 1,000 feature films and TV shows, such as The Martian, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2. === Mac App Store versions === There are versions of both DaVinci Resolve (the free edition) and DaVinci Resolve Studio available from the macOS App Store; however, some aspects of the application's functionality are not available from these versions, such as CUDA support, due to restrictions enforced by Apple. == Related hardware == The DaVinci Resolve Advanced Panel (previously known as Impresario). Since introducing software-only options for Resolve, Blackmagic Design have also released separate hardware control panels, designed to integrate with the Resolve software and provide users with a tactile interface and access to additional shortcuts. These panels include the DaVinci Resolve Micro Panel, the DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel (both released in 2017), and the DaVinci Resolve Advanced Panel (previously known as Impresario when manufactured by da Vinci Systems). In addition to the full control panels, Blackmagic Design also announced the Editor Keyboard for Resolve in April 2019. The Editor Keyboard includes a standard computer keyboard, alongside specific components for controlling the Resolve software (such as a dial for altering the timeline position), designed to support the use of 2 hands for editing tasks. Resolve also integrates with other hardware produced by Blackmagic Design, such as their 'Cintel' film scanner. In July 2018, Blackmagic Design released an external, portable graphics processing unit, named the eGPU, developed in association with Apple to leverage the Metal API for professional video and graphics (such as those used by DaVinci Resolve). == Reception == Davinci Resolve only had 100 users in 2009; however, since being acquired by Blackmagic Design, the software had a user base of more than 2 million using the free version alone as of January 2019. This is a comparable user base to Apple's Final Cut Pro X, which also had 2 million users as of April 2017. In 2011, DaVinci Resolve received a Red Dot award for 'Motion Picture Colour Grading System'. Version 14 received an additional Red Dot award in 2017 for 'User Interface Design, Post-Production Software', and in the same year, the software's newly released control panels, the Micro Panel and Mini Panel, also received Red Dot awards for 'Motion Picture Colour Grading System'. Version 14 also received a 2018 Good Design Australia Award, as did the DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel. In 2018, the Hollywood Professional Association (HPA) named DaVinci Resolve (version 15) as a recipient of their 2018 Engineering Excellence Awards. == Media produced using DaVinci Resolve == === Film === DaVinci Resolve has been used for the color grading and/or editing of feature films such as Alien: Covenant, Avatar, Best of Enemies, Deadpool 2, Jason Bourne, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, La La Land, Love & Mercy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Prometheus, Robin Hood, Spectre, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and X-Men: Apocalypse. DaVinci Resolve and Blackmagic Design hardware were used to create five of the eight 2019 Oscar nominated best picture films including Bohemian Rhapsody (most awards), The Favourite (most nominations), Roma (most nominations), Green Book (won Best Picture) and Vice. Additionally, DaVinci Resolve and Blackmagic Design hardware were used to create 13 2019 Oscar nominated films, 9 2017 Oscar nominated films, 7 2016 Oscar nominated films, 4 2014 Oscar nominated films, and 4 2010 Oscar nominated films (2 for Best Picture). 20 films at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival leveraged DaVinci Resolve, followed by 35 in 2016, over 45 in 2017, over 55 in 2018, and over 35 in 2019. Presence of films created with Resolve at other film festivals includes the 2018 Austin Film Festival (over 25 films), the 2014 Cannes Film Festival (3 films), the 2015 Cannes Film Festival (21 films), the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, and the 2016 and 2017 South by Southwest festivals. DaVinci Resolve has also been used in the restoration of classic films, such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, Spartacus, Black Like Me, Jamaica Inn, and The Perfect Woman. === Television === DaVinci Resolve software has been used in television shows including 2 Broke Girls, American Horror Story, Arrow, Ash vs Evil Dead, The Big Bang Theory, Criminal Minds, Daredevil, The Flash, Gotham, How To Get Away With Murder, The Last Man on Earth, Lethal Weapon, The Man in the High Castle, The Mentalist, The Muppets, NCIS: Los Angeles, Orphan Black', Portlandia, Sons of Anarchy, Supernatural, The Walking Dead, and Westworld. The software has also been used in the creation of television shows which have received Emmy Awards, such as Game of Thrones and Modern Family. More than 55 of the 2018 fall television and streaming series relied on Blackmagic Design software and hardware, including DaVinci Resolve. === Other media === DaVinci Resolve has also been used during the creation of other media, such as music videos, advertisements, concert production, and online media. == See also == * Comparison of video editing software *List of video editing software == References == == Further reading == * Scoppettuolo, Dion (2018-08-14).
