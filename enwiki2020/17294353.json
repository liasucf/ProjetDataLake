Led by second-year head coach and general manager Lou Saban, the Broncos improved their record from the previous season by posting a record of five wins and nine losses. They finished fourth in the AFL's Western division for the sixth straight season; the expansion Cincinnati Bengals finished fifth, allowing Denver to escape the cellar. There were threats of the Broncos relocating to Atlanta, Chicago, and Birmingham, Alabama.Sports Illustrated', July 26, 2010, The Unexpected Hero by Gary Smith, p.60, Published by Time Inc.
