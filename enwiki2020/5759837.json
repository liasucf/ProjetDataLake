    "text": "South Melbourne is a former railway station on the former St Kilda line, located in the Melbourne suburb of South Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is located on the corner of Ferrars and Dorcas Streets, just minutes from South Melbourne Market. A pair of low level side platforms now serve route 96 trams on the light rail line, with a pedestrian crossing located in between. ==History== South Melbourne station opened in 1858, not long after the line through it was opened in 1857. It was originally known as Emerald Hill, and was renamed South Melbourne in 1884. To the south of the station are three road overpasses in quick succession, for Dorcas, Bank and Park Streets. The St Kilda line was closed in 1987, and was converted to light rail, with the route 96 tram now running through the former station. The last train service ran on 31 July 1987, with the light rail officially commissioned on 21 November of the same year. The high level train platforms and station buildings have been fenced off from public access. ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in Melbourne Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1858 Category:Railway stations closed in 1987 Category:1987 disestablishments in Australia ",
