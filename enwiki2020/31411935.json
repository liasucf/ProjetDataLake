    "text": "P.A.N. (A.K.A.: Poetry Analyzer, Textual Analyzer) is a freeware application that allows users to analyze virtually any sort of text (fiction, newspaper, poetry, history textbook). It does this by parsing text, determining sentence structure, identifies mood and tones of sentences. Also identifies primary imagery and themes. Poetry Analyzer's website states that a unique analysis of text is accomplished by studying that which is most overlooked, and considered not relevant. ==Background== P.A.N. is essentially an unbiased third party giving its analytic interpretation of any given text. Poetry Analyzer works in sections, first by breaking down a text into clauses. This makes it more feasible to analyze and determine impact of keywords, themes, terms and word usage/combinations. Sentence structure and mood/tones are determined, while identification of key imagery is then identified. ==Methodology== Using computer software to analyze or study literature is different from analyzing it as a human, because a program cannot become so overwhelmed in intricate word styles or metaphors that meaning is lost. This is a major reason for using software for this purpose. Much like any other software for this purpose, P.A.N. utilizes a series of complex detection algorithms to seek out and identify word usage, key terms and unique imagery. ===Key Stones=== Much like a stone arch, in every phrase exists a key element that enables it to retain form (or in this case, meaning). Consider a term such as: \"The excitable fox ran from the dog to the river\". Much like the human mind, P.A.N. recognizes a \"fox ran\" as being the central thought within this phrase. The human mind sees: [Excitable + Fox] [Ran + from dog] = Excitable fox running from dog. P.A.N. elaborates: [Clever + Fox] [Ran + out of fear + from dog] = Clever fox ran out of fear from dog. Through individual word analysis and thematic associations, P.A.N. identifies these Key Stones and associates key terms and words that are linked to them. ==The Human Element== P.A.N. does not try to copy or mimic human emotion and intrigue. What P.A.N. exceeds at however is analyzing the obvious in a way that may not be considered conventional. Through this manner of interpretation and illustrating its analysis demonstrates how P.A.N. can be considered useful by showing users something familiar but in an entirely fresh new way. ==External links== * http://pan.sourceforge.net/ - P.A.N.s' main website Category:Freeware ",
