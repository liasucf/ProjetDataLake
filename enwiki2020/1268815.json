Its campus sits on the banks of the Huron River, about ten minutes outside downtown Ann Arbor. Concordia is affiliated with the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod (LCMS) and is a college of the Concordia University System. CUAA merged with Concordia University Wisconsin, located in Mequon, Wisconsin, in 2013. Concordia University Ann Arbor has approximately 1,000 students, with a student-faculty ratio of about 11 to 1. Concordia offers over 70 areas of study, graduate programs, a set of adult education programs, and a variety of study-abroad activities. ==History== Earhart Manor on the Concordia campusIn the early 1960s, the LCMS purchased the Earhart Manor and surrounding estate in Ann Arbor and began construction of Concordia Lutheran Junior College. The campus was designed by architect Vincent Kling in a mid-century modern style. Classes began in the fall of 1964 with 234 students and 24 instructors. The school began offering four-year degree programs in 1976 and changed its name to Concordia College. It assumed its current name in 2001.Chapel of the Holy Trinity In 1977, Concordia began performing the \"Boars Head Festival\", an annual Christmas celebration filled with song, music, and drama; much beloved by current students, alumni, and community members. From 1993 to 1995, it was the home of Accordion Magazine, which has since been resurrected under the name Arbor Light Magazine. In the 2000s, the university experienced \"a number of financial, enrollment and administrative difficulties\" that prompted it to enter into discussions with Concordia University Wisconsin about a possible merger. The merger became effective on July 1, 2013, with Curt Gielow, former executive dean of CUW\u2019s School of Pharmacy and former mayor of Mequon, becoming Vice President of Administration and Chief Campus Officer at CUAA. He was replaced at the end of 2018 by Ryan Peterson. In 2015, the university purchased the former Ann Arbor campus of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. That facility, north of the main campus, is now the home of CUAA's School of Nursing. ==Campus photographs== Image:choirchapel.jpg|Choir singing in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity File:Chapel Concordia University Michigan.jpg|Through central campus ==Athletics== CUAA athletic teams are known as the Cardinals.
