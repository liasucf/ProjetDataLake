    "text": ": This article describes Kapitan as military rank, not to be confused with the title of Kapitan. For the equivalent OF-2 rank in Anglophone armed forces, see Captain, and in Germany see Hauptmann. mil. engineering Netherlands ca. 1900. Kapitan (derived from ; before Latin: capitaneus \u2013 (military) leader, count, or chairman of a parish council; or from Latin: caput \u2013 head, main, chief, primary, principal, general, central, leading, etc.) is used manifold as rank, grade, or rank designation in the Army, Air Force or Navy of numerous countries and armed forces. In member countries of NATO-alliance Kapitan is a commissioned officer rank, rated OF-2 in line to the NATO officers rank system. The almost equivalent OF-2 officer, e.g. in the US Army, is the Captain rank. == Historical roots == Kapitan (appointment, later rank) was used first in the middle age in France in order to designate leaders of the military districts or regions. In the second half of the 16th century, it came in use to specify commanding officers of company-sized units. In the 19th century it became gradually a military rank, and was used in combination with other noun, e.g. Stabs-kapitan (ru: \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0441-\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d Russian Imperial Army) Kapitan-leytenant (naval forces). The rank designation Kapitan contains a common syllable and historical roots in a number of European countries at the one hand. Slight national variations of spelling are for the sake of the historical and heraldic tradition, at the other hand. == Different countries == == Russia == In Russia, the military rank Kapitan was introduced in the XVI century to foreign officers, appointed to commander of company-sized units. In the XVII \u2013 XVII century this rank became open to all company commanders, serving in the regular army. In the cavalierly (in dragoon regiments and Special Corps of Gendarmes) the equivalent to Kapitan was Rotmister (derived from the German Rittmeister), and in the Cossacks corps it was Yesaul. In the Russian Army (1855\u20131917) and in the so-called White Army braid shoulder boards with one central stripe have been worn (see picture 1, below). As the Major- rank was abolished in May 1884, the Kapitan-rank was upgraded to level VIII in the rank table. However, the Guards kapitan became equivalent to generic Podpolkovnik in the Army. In the civil administration Kapitan of the infantry was equivalent to the Council assessor (ru: \u041a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440; Kolleshsky assessor) from 1884, and Titular adviser (ru: \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, Tituljarny sovetnik) until 1884. {| class=\"wikipedia sortable\" border=\"1\" |- |+ Sequence of ranks RIA 1917 |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\"| lower rank: Shtabs-kapitan (en: Staff captain) |width=\"35%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#bfbfbf;\"| 30px30px Kapitan (en: Captain) |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#afafaf;\" | higher rank: Major (en: Major) |} Some examples of rank insignia (epaulette, shoulder board), used by RIA IRA, are shown below: 1904ir018-e09.png|Kapitan epaulette (1904) 1904ir018-p09.png| ... shoulder board 1914ir018-pf09.png| ... fiel uniform === Soviet Union and Russian Federation === In the armed forces of the Soviet Union (later Russian Federation) the Kapitan\u00b4s rank (to Army, Air Force, and Navy land services) was introduced by disposal of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars, from September 22, 1935.Decree of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars, from September 22, 1935, on introduction of individual military rank designation to commanding personnel of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
