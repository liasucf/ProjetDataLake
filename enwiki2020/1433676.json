They fall in love, but because of their age must fight their parents and welfare, who try to keep them apart. Lola falls pregnant and the couple runs away so they can keep their baby and live happily ever after. Lola's mother and the police find them and take Lola home. Brownie joins the crew of a ship so he can sail the coast and look for Lola. Meanwhile, Lola is forced to have an abortion by her mother in Brisbane. After an argument with her mother about Brownie and the abortion, Lola moves to Melbourne, becomes a waitress and bleaches her hair. Lola is reunited with Brownie after he visits the bar where Lola works whilst on shore leave. She returns with Brownie to his ship and they spend the night together in Brownie's cabin, where they are discovered the following morning by Brownie's friend and boss, Bosun. After an argument between Brownie and Bosun as to whether Lola should return to her mother or stay with Brownie, Bosun eventually relents and says that Lola can stay, so long as she is kept \"out of sight\" from the other sailors. After the ship docks, Lola and Brownie attend a party held by a young couple, Lyle and Mavis. They are squatting in the property with their daughter, Sharon. One night, Lola and Brownie are arrested for underage drinking after being caught leaving a pub. Lola is taken away by her mother and welfare to live with Aunt Westbury, a caretaker in the countryside for a fixed-term of 12 months. She and Brownie are told that they are not allowed to see or contact each other for one year. During Lola's stay in the community placement, a former charge of Aunt's visits the house. During this visit, Lola collects the mail and, after a brief conversation with the postman, realizes that her caretaker has thrown all Brownie's letters in the bin. Lola and the caretaker fight, and Lola runs away. Finding her mother drunk and unsympathetic, Lola returns to Lyle and Sharon's home, only to be arrested and taken to a young offenders' institution to restart and complete her sentence. During this time, a riot is started by the other inmates. After her 18th birthday, Lola is released from jail and is subsequently reunited with Brownie. They return to the house, where Lola discovers that Mavis is heavily pregnant with her and Lyle's second child. Lola wants Brownie to quit his job as a sailor, and stay with her; however, Brownie is unsure and confides in Bosun about his dilemma. Mavis goes into labor. The birth does not go well and both Mavis and the baby die. Although Lola and Brownie offer to adopt Mavis' surviving daughter, they are unable to as they are unmarried. Lyle leaves the child with Lola to give to social services as she will be placed into foster care and Lyle is unable to bear the thought of giving up his only child. Lyle subsequently leaves after telling Lola he intends to travel the world and taking on odd jobs to make ends meet while stopping off at different locations on his travels. He also tells Lola that he is too devastated by recent events to remarry or have another family. En route to the welfare office, Brownie sees Lola and Sharon in the taxi and runs after them. Eventually, Brownie catches up with the taxi and he is reunited with Lola and Sharon. The film ends with their wedding with their families and friends in attendance. ==Cast== * Kylie Minogue as Lola Lovell * Charlie Schlatter as Brownie Hansen * Bruno Lawrence as Bosun * Todd Boyce as Lyle * Desir\u00e9e Smith as Mavis * Angela Punch McGregor as Mrs. Lovell * Melissa Jaffer as Aunt Westbury * Lynette Curran as Mrs. Hansen * Duncan Wass as Bert * Lyn Treadgold as Prison matron * Rosemary Harris as Isobel ==Original novel== The novel was published in 1962. It had been written in a TB hospital. The novel was submitted for the Miles Franklin Award. Rohan died in 1963, having only published one other book in her lifetime. The novel was re-published in 1986. ==Production== Rights to the novel were purchased by first time producers Alex Cutler and Michael Wilcox in 1985. They had been trying to obtain the rights to another Australian novel but had difficulty negotiating with the author; someone suggested they have a look at The Delinquents, which Penguin were about to reissue. They obtained finance from the New South Wales Film Corporation and Australian Film Commission and hired Lex Marinos to write a draft. In 1987 David Bowie announced in an interview he thought the book would make a good film, which re-ignited a great deal of interest in the project.Patricia Amad & Philippa Hawker, \"The Delinquents\", Cinema Papers, July 1989 p4-7 Bowie subsequently distanced himself from the film's production, and interviewed in 1990, he cited \"a large artistic disagreement with [the] producers\" over the direction of the film as the reason he was no longer involved in the film. He said, \"the book that I read and the film that they were making had nothing to do with each other\", adding \"it was a wonderful little book and it should have been a little film. It should have been an Australian film.\"The Simon Bates interviews, BBC Radio 1, Jan-Feb 1990 The Australian Film Commission provided further script development money enabling Dorothy Hewett to write a second draft. Greg Coote and John Tarnoff of Village Roadshow became involved and Coote suggested Kylie Minogue play the lead. At one stage Ben Mendelsohn was signed to appear opposite her but eventually it was decided to go with an imported actor so the film might appeal to an international market: Charlie Schlatter was chosen.Helen Barlow, \"The Australian Film Finance Corporation\", Cinema Papers, August 1991 p36 Chris Thomson was approached to direct. He did not like the script but thought the book was wonderful, so managed to persuade the producers to hire Mac Gudgeon, who had made Waterfront (1983) with Thomson, to work on the script. Village Roadshow agreed to provide half the budget and the producers applied to the FFC for further finance in October 1988. The film was partly shot at Warner Bros studios on the Gold Coast. ==Release and reception== ===Reception=== DVD.net later gave the movie a mixed review, scoring it 5/10.http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=5145 On Scoopy.com, the reviewer complimented the film's cinematography, the period details and Minogue's lead role in the film.http://www.scoopy.com/delinquents.htm The Radio Times grades the film two stars out of five, calling it a \"passable tale of teenage torment\".http://www.radiotimes.com/film/mv4bp/the-delinquents ===Novel=== The Delinquents was re-released in the 1989 to tie-in with the release of the film.http://cgi.ebay.com/DELINQUENTS-Book-Movie-1989-PB- Rohan-/250805309102?pt=AU_Fiction_Books_2&hash;=item3a65294eae There are some differences between the film and the novel. For example, in the novel, Lola is part Asian and suffers a miscarriage on the grounds of the all-girls school. It is uncertain whether the screenplay was adjusted or the missing parts of the book were filmed and removed to meet a lower certificate. ===Box office and initial screening=== The Delinquents grossed $3,370,650 at the Australian box office in Australia. It was the most successful Australian film of 1990 on Australian soil. In the United Kingdom it reached number one, grossing \u00a31,072,110 in its first week.
