    "text": "Monster By Mistake is a Canadian CGI-animated series that aired on YTV from October 26, 1996, to March 23, 2003. The series was created by Mark Mayerson of Catapult Productions and co-produced with CCI Entertainment (formerly Cambium) in Toronto, Canada. The two companies partnered in Studio 345, a computer animation and former Sears catalogue production facility for the production of the show, which was made using Houdini software. == Characters == * Warren Patterson (voiced by Julie Lemieux in the series and voiced by Corey Sevier in the pilot episode) is the protagonist of the show, who turns into the titular blue monster whenever he sneezes after having been accidentally cursed by Gorgool's jewel. * Tracy Patterson (voiced by Hillary Goldhar) is Warren's supportive older sister who practices witchcraft after receiving Gorgool's book. * Johnny B. Dead (voiced by William Colgate) is a wise-cracking, trumpet-playing ghost who assists the siblings in their misadventures and secretly lives in the Pattersons' attic. === Recurring characters === * Roz and Tom Patterson (voiced by Sally Cahill and Tony Rosato) are the parents of Warren and Tracy. * Aunt Dolores (voiced by Jayne Eastwood) is Warren and Tracy's aunt, a crabby and stuck-up but serious and well-meaning police officer and the older sister of Tom Patterson. She has a vendetta against the monster, unaware of it being her nephew. * Billy Castleman (voiced by Daniel DeSanto) is an overweight, mean school bully who often ridicules Warren. * Gorgool (voiced by Len Carlson) is a sorcerer and the would-be ruler of Fenrath, who is trapped in a ball. He intends to steal the Jewel of Fenrath and the Book of Spells with his servant. * The Servant (voiced by Howard Jerome) is the dim-witted servant of Gorgool. He carries Gorgool around and follows Gorgool's every command. His real name is never mentioned. * Wesley Whiffington III (voiced by Christopher Ralph) is a child who appears in Season Two. He is spoiled and never gets things his way. He is also interested in adult projects such as business and moviemaking. * Miranda Bell (voiced by Alyson Court) is a girl who said she became a scientist at age six and says that her brain weighs eight pounds. * Morgool (voiced by Len Carlson) is Gorgool's twin brother and the ruler of Fenrath. He is not trapped within a ball and is far more dangerous and evil than his twin. It is believed that Morgool is unable to control anyone who is superior to him, such as the monster, and his jealousy and greed for the throne resulted in Gorgool's confinement to the glass ball. * Ms. Gish (voiced by Barbara Franklin) is the teacher who is involved with most episodes in Season One. * Kragon (voiced by George Buza) is a guard working for Morgool in Fenrath. He always helps his master in his schemes, mainly trying to capture the monster. Kragon's home region is Gorem Range. * Red (voiced by Megan Fahlenbock) is an orphan from Fenrath who becomes friends with Warren and Tracy. She is always up for adventure and kicking bad-guy butt. * Freddie Mitchell and Corum (both voiced by Susan Roman) are friends of Warren's. Freddie loves to tell jokes and play soccer. Connor's hobbies include pogo jumping, playing the piano, and video games. ==Episodes== * The first episode aired on September 6, 1999, and the last episode aired on March 23, 2003. To date, 52 episodes have been produced in three seasons. ===Pilot (1996)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\" |- style=\"color:white\" ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| # ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Original air date |} ===Season 1 (1999)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\" |- style=\"color:white\" ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| # ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Original air date |} ===Season 2 (2000)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\" |- style=\"color:white\" ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| # ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Original air date |} ===Season 3 (2003)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\" |- style=\"color:white\" ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| # ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#9C276B;\"| Original air date |} == Notes == * Prior to the series being made, the pilot episode aired as a yearly Halloween special from 1996 to 1999. == Home Media Releases == Several episodes of the series have been released on VHS and DVD with each containing two episodes each. * Disc one: \"Monster on Purpose,\" and \"The Jewel of Fenrath\" * Disc two: \"Badgering Billy,\" and \"Haunted House\" * Disc three: \"Sasquashed,\" and \"Campsite Creeper\" Several VHS tapes of the series were released in 1999 & 2000 * Monster By Mistake and Entertaining Orivilie * Home Alone and Monster a Go-Go * Fossil Remains and Kidnapped * Gorgool's Pet and Jungleland As of 2020, 29 out of the 52 episodes have been uploaded to the official Monster By Mistake youtube channel, with prior to January 2019, a new episode being uploaded every Thursday.
