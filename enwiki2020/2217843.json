    "text": "Gordon Barraclough Parker AO is an Australian psychiatrist who is scientia professor of psychiatry at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Parker\u2019s particular focus is on the phenomenology and epidemiology of mood disorders, social psychiatry, and the treatment (both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy) and management of mood disorders. His research has assisted in modelling psychiatric conditions \u2013 depression, bipolar and personality disorders \u2013 and examining causes, mechanisms and treatments for mood disorders, together with innovative clinical work. Parker is a critic of the current unitary classification of major depressive disorder (as represented in the DSM-5), and has proposed the revival of the diagnosis of melancholia. In 2010 he was made an officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his distinguished service to psychiatry as a clinician and researcher, particularly as a major contributor to the understanding and innovative treatment of mood disorders and as founder and Executive Director of the Black Dog Institute. ==Early life and education== Parker was born in Melbourne, schooled at Shore in Sydney, completed an MB BS at the University of Sydney (USyd), and an MD (1978), PhD (1983) and DSc (1997) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). He is married, with four children. His path to Medicine and his clinical rationale is outlined in his autobiography, \"A Piece of My Mind\".A Piece of My Mind : A Psychiatrist on the Couch, MacMillan, Sydney, 2012 ==Career== Parker was Head of the School of Psychiatry at the University of NSW from 1983-2002, as well as Director of the Division of Psychiatry at Prince of Wales and Prince Henry Hospitals in Sydney from 1983 to 1996. In 2002, he became the founder and inaugural Director of the Black Dog Institute, an organisation that focuses on research into and treatment of mood disorders, in particular clinical depression and bipolar disorder. As a consequence of his advocacy for diagnosing melancholia, in 2010 Parker was invited to head a group of prominent international psychiatrists to argue for its separate status in the new DSM-5 classificatory system.Parker, G., Fink, M., Shorter, E., Taylor, M.A., Akiskal, H., Berrios, G., Bolwig, T., Brown, W.A., Carroll, B., Healy, D., Klein, D.F., Koukopoulos, A., Michels, R., Paris, J., Rubin, R.T., Spitzer, R., and Swartz, C.

He is an invited assessor for various National Health and Medical Research (NHMRC) Grants as well as for scientific journals, for example, The Lancet and The American Journal of Psychiatry. He has been involved with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) \u2013 as Editor of the Journal (1979-88) and Chair of the Quality Assurance Committee (1990-95).Finlay-Jones, R.

Parker has also held a number of positions with legal organisations, including the NSW Guardianship Board (1990-95) and the NSW Administrative Appeals Tribunal (1991-92). He has sought to make the community more aware of depressive sub-types (especially melancholia) and the bipolar conditions (especially bipolar II disorder) via multiple TV, radio and print interviews and personalised programs (for instance, two ABC Australian Story programs detailing nuances of bipolar II disorder). During his time at the Black Dog Institute, Parker \u2018translated\u2019 research findings via educational programs \u2013 some with health professionals in mind and some shaped for the general community. Parker has also developed or evaluated a number of assessment and self-assessment tools to help practitioners and individuals to gauge the type and clinical import of a mood disorder. ==Awards and recognition== In 2004, Parker received a Citation Laureate from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) as the Australian Scientist most highly cited in the field of \u201cPsychiatry/Psychology\u201d.
