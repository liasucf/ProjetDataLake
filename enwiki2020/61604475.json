The Sierra Almijara is a rough mass of marble mountains with sharp ridges that stretched east from the Puerto de C\u00f3mpeta. The most prominent peak is the Cerro Lucero. The mountain has an elevation of , and the peak has a prominence of . The peak is from Navachica () in an ESE direction and from La Maroma ( in a WNW direction. ==Access== The Cerro del Lucero is on the border between Malaga and Granada, and can be accessed from both provinces. The peak can be accessed from the La Resinera information point, heading south for about along a path to the start of the trail. From here a trail with high difficulty leads to the peak. ==Peak== The Cerro del Lucero is pyramidal or conical in shape. The local name is the Cerro de los Moriscos, and its prominent ridge, sharp in the south and somewhat less so in the north, is called the Rasp\u00f3n de los Moriscos. The Rasp\u00f3n de los Moriscos is visible from almost all of the eastern part of the province of M\u00e1laga. From the Pico Lucero there are imposing views of the Depression of Granada, Los Bermejales Reservoir, Sierra Nevada, the Higuer\u00f3n river basin, the Axarqu\u00eda and the Rif mountain range in Morocco. There is a semi-ruined Civil Guard post at the summit that was built after the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) when the mountains were the base for the Granada-M\u00e1laga Guerrilla Group, which fought against Francoist Spain until their final defeat in 1951. ==Geology== The Sierra Almijara holds one of the Spain's main sources of dolomitic marble. The marble gives white and gray tones to the ridges and ravines. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:Mountains of Andalusia ",
