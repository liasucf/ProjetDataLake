    "text": "\"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\" is a 1979 disco song recorded by soul singer Edwin Starr. Starr's previous release, \"Contact\", had proved to be his best showing on the US Pop Charts (and R&B; Charts) in several years. It was also a huge hit in Britain, making it into the Top Ten and peaking at #6 on the UK Singles Chart. This song was issued as its follow-up, and although less successful, still made all three charts. \"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\" peaked at #79 on the Hot 100 and #28 on the R&B; Charts, but was a much bigger hit in the UK, where it was a Top Ten hit (#9) in mid-1979. The song was both written and produced by Edwin Starr himself. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1979) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|54 |- |United Kingdom (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |United States (Billboard Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|79 |} Starr later re-recorded the song as part of Ian Levine's Motorcity Records project, along with many of his previous Ric-Tic and Motown songs. In 1989 the British singer Michaela released a cover version of the song. ==References== ==External links== * Full Lyrics at MetroLyrics Category:1979 singles Category:1979 songs Category:Disco songs Category:Edwin Starr songs Category:Songs written by Edwin Starr ",
