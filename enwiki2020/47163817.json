    "text": "Gerald S. Handel (born 1924) is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology at The City College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He earned A.B., A.M and Ph.D. degrees from The University of Chicago, where he was influenced by the Symbolic Interactionist ideas of George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley. ==Career== That influence contributed to shaping the research study that resulted in the book Family Worlds (1959) by Hess & Handel. This study of two-parent, first-marriage families with two or three children between the ages of six and eighteen was the first sociological study of families based on interviews with both parents and all the children, leading to an endorsement by University of Minnesota family sociologist Reuben Hill: \u201cbreaks new ground in the social psychology of the family.\u201d Handel later published a paper, \u201cFamily Worlds and Qualitative Family Research: Emergence and Prospects of Whole Family Methodology\u201d (1996) showing that the concepts and methods developed in Family Worlds were equally applicable to families of any composition, with at least three members, whose members inhabited a shared household over an extended period of time. The original study also reflected the influence of W. Lloyd Warner\u2019s idea of social class; Warner was a teacher of both authors. Handel\u2019s edited book, The Psychosocial Interior of the Family (1967) sought to extend the range of the basic ideas. Handel\u2019s Making a Life in Yorkville: Experience and Meaning in the Life-Course Narrative of an Urban Working-Class Man (2000, 2003) is a symbolic interactionist study of the life course. It presents the unedited text of life-history interviews he conducted with a construction worker, and an analytic framework that seeks to broaden understanding of the life course. Having responsibility for an undergraduate course in social welfare, Handel wrote Social Welfare in Western Society (1982), which conceptualizes social welfare as based on the concept of Help, and argues that social welfare in Western society has been based on five eventually competing concepts of Help: namely, Charity, Public Welfare, Social Insurance, Social Service, and Mutual Aid. The concepts and the socio- political conflicts over them are examined historically, The concluding chapter discusses enduring issues in social welfare. An updated edition appeared in 2009. Handel\u2019s collaborative work includes Children and Society (2005), The Apple Sliced: Sociological Studies of New York City (1984), Qualitative Methods in Family Research (1992), and Workingman\u2019s Wife (1959). He is also the author of numerous journal articles, book chapters, and conference presentations. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:Living people Category:City College of New York faculty Category:American sociologists Category:American male writers Category:University of Chicago alumni ",
