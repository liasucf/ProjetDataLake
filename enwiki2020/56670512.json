Kyle received two Silver Stars for gallantry in action during Pacific Campaign in World War II. He later took part in the Vietnam War and distinguished himself as commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division. ==Early years== Kyle was born on March 3, 1915, in Pecos, Texas, and grew up in Hillsboro, where he attended a local high school. Upon his graduation in the summer of 1932, Kyle went to College Station, where he attended Texas A&M; University. While at university, he was a member of ROTC unit and following his graduation in June 1936 with a Bachelor's Degree, Kyle was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve. However, Kyle resigned his U.S. Army commission; in order to accept appointment as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on July 11, 1936. He was subsequently ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for his basic officers' training and graduated in April of the following year. He was in the same class as another future general, Lewis W. Walt. Kyle was subsequently ordered to attached to San Diego, California, and appointed platoon leader in the 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Brigade. He embarked for China in October 1937 and later took part in the guard duties at the International Settlement of Shanghai. His unit was ordered back to the States in April 1938 and subsequently served at Marine Corps Base San Diego until May 1940. Meanwhile, Kyle was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in July 1939. He then served with the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington and took part in the patrol cruises off the coast of Hawaii. ==World War II== With the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kyle was promoted to the temporary rank of captain and ordered to San Diego, where he was appointed company commander within 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines under Colonel John M. Arthur. The 2nd Marines were tasked with the training of new recruits, before they were ordered to Koro Island in July 1942. Kyle was promoted to the rank of major during the following month and appointed executive officer of 1st Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Hill. During the Guadalcanal Campaign, 1st Battalion landed on the island at the beginning of October 1942 and immediately took part in the actions against Japanese units. On November 10, Lt. Col. Hill was severely wounded by enemy artillery fire in Matanikau sector and was evacuated from the island. Kyle assumed command of the battalion and although he was wounded, he refused to be evacuated and remained with his troops. He successfully drove through relentless Japanese resistance to capture his objective. In the final assault launched in the same area, Major Kyle further distinguished himself when, by his dauntless courage and expert professional ability, he completed his assigned mission within four hours of its initiation. He was decorated with the Silver Star for his gallantry in action and the Purple Heart for his wounds. Kyle remained with 1st Battalion at Guadalcanal until the end of January 1943 and subsequently was ordered to Wellington, New Zealand. He was appointed permanent commanding officer of 1st Battalion and spent following several months with training and reorganization for upcoming combat deployment \u2013 Tarawa. The first battalion was designated regimental reserve, but casualties were so high, that Colonel David M. Shoup ordered Kyle and his unit ashore during the first hours of the landing. Major Kyle immediately directed his companies\u2019 in the bitter assault against a fanatic enemy and despite the extreme danger, personally commanded his men in brilliantly executed attacks against the heavily defended central sector of the island. Assuming control of the remnants of one of the battalions of his regiment the following day, he promptly reorganized the unit for further sustained operations against the strongly entrenched Japanese. Kyle received his second Silver Star for his actions on Tarawa and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1943.
