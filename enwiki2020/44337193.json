He was elected by 332 votes, with 11 votes appearing to be void. The result was greeted with loud cheers. He was elected by the Polish Sejm (Diet) and Senate sitting together as the National Assembly. The National Assembly had 555 members but only 343 were present, mainly members of BBWR, the government party of Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. The main opposition party, SN, stayed away, but representatives of German minority and Jewish parties plus three smaller parties (including the Communists who tried to nominate their own candidate but did not have the necessary 50 votes to nominate) were present;. == References == *Keesings Contemporary Archives (London) 1933 p787C *The Times (London) 9 May 1933 p13 Category:1933 in Poland Category:1933 elections in Europe 1933 ",
