As such, from 1949-56, he was the de facto ruler of the Hungarian People's Republic.Bert\u00e9nyi Iv\u00e1n. Gyapai G\u00e1bor: Magyarorsz\u00e1g r\u00f6vid t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete (Maecenas, 2001). An ardent Stalinist, his government was very loyal to the Soviet Union, and he presided over the mass imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian people and the deaths of thousands.Hungary: The Revolution of 1956 \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia, britannica.com; accessed 22 July 2020. ==Early years== R\u00e1kosi was born in Ada, a village in B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County in the Kingdom of Hungary (now a town in Vojvodina, Serbia). Born to Jewish parents, the fourth son of J\u00f3zsef Rosenfeld, a grocer, his mother Cec\u00edlia L\u00e9derer would give birth to seven more children. Of his younger siblings the most notable was Ferenc R\u00e1kosi (later Bir\u00f3, 1904\u20132006), an administrator, who also became active in Communist politics and was, for a time, General Manager of the M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi Steel and Metal Works during his brother's rule.P\u00fcnk\u00f6sti, \u00c1rp\u00e1d: szerelmes R\u00e1kosi, In: Forr\u00e1s, 2003\u201310 His other siblings were B\u00e9la (1886\u20131944), Jol\u00e1n (1888\u2013?), Matild Gizella (1890\u2013?), Izabella (1895\u2013?), Margit (1896\u20131932), Zolt\u00e1n (1898\u2013?), M\u00e1ria (1902\u20131938), Dezs\u0151 (1906\u2013?) and Hajnal (1908\u20131944). R\u00e1kosi's paternal grandfather participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848; as a result, he had to flee the village following the defeat. R\u00e1kosi's father, J\u00f3zsef Rosenfeld, was called \"Kossuth's Jew\" by the villagers, because he had been a member and avid supporter of the oppositionist Party of Independence and '48. He changed his surname Rosenfeld to R\u00e1kosi in 1903.A Bel\u00fcgyminiszt\u00e9rium 1903. \u00e9vi 86113. sz. rendelete.

R\u00e1kosi was a diligent and good student during his childhood.P\u00fcnk\u00f6sti \u00c1rp\u00e1d: R\u00e1kosi, Szt\u00e1lin legjobb tan\u00edtv\u00e1nya, mek.oszk.hu; accessed 22 July 2020. He finished his elementary studies in Sopron, then took his final exam at the High Technical Gymnasium of Szeged in 1910. He then studied external trade at the Eastern Commerce Academy.ELTE Egyetemi, leveltar.elte.hu; accessed 22 July 2020 (in Hungarian). He won scholarships for a year each in Hamburg (1912) and London (1913). While still a student in Hungary, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) in 1910 and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle.Propagandafilm forgat\u00f3k\u00f6nyve R\u00e1kosi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s 60. sz\u00fclet\u00e9snapj\u00e1ra (MOL M-KS 267. f. 65. cs. 388. \u0151. e. \u2013 Magyar Orsz\u00e1gos Lev\u00e9lt\u00e1r MDP R\u00e1kosi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s titk\u00e1ri iratai).

He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation in Russia, he successfully escaped from his detention and moved to Petrograd, centre of the Bolshevik Revolution. ==Early career== M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi in 1919 After returning to Hungary, he participated in the communist movement of B\u00e9la Kun and also joined the Party of Communists in Hungary. During the short-lived 133-day Communist rule after the resignation of President Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic was established, R\u00e1kosi served as Deputy People's Commissar for Trade from 21 March to 3 April in the Revolutionary Governing Council led by S\u00e1ndor Garbai. Between 3 April and 24 June 1919, R\u00e1kosi was one of the six people's commissars for social production, alongside Jen\u0151 Varga, Antal Dovcs\u00e1k, Gyula Hevesi, J\u00f3zsef Kelen and Ferenc Baj\u00e1ki. He was also involved in the Hungarian Red Army's Northern and Eastern military campaigns against the newly formed Czechoslovakia and Romania. At the end of July 1919, he was promoted to Commander of the internal law-enforcement Red Guard for a short time. Following the Soviet Republic's fall, R\u00e1kosi fled Hungary on 2 August 1919 via the Austrian border, eventually to the Soviet Union where he worked as part of the Communist International, including representing it at the Livorno congress of the Italian Socialist Party.Fernbach, D. 'Introduction', In The Footsteps of Rosa Luxemburg, Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2012; pg.16 After returning to Hungary in 1924, he was imprisoned, but he was released to the Soviet Union in 1940, in exchange for the Hungarian revolutionary banners captured by Russian troops at Vil\u00e1gos in 1849.M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi In the Soviet Union, he became leader of the Comintern. In 1942, he married divorced lawyer Feodora (Fenia) Kornilova, a woman of Yakut origin. He returned to Debrecen, Hungary, on 30 January 1945, having been selected by the Soviet authorities to organise the Hungarian Communist Party. ==Leader of Hungary== R\u00e1kosi addresses an election rally in Budapest, 1954 When the Red Army set up a Soviet-approved government in Hungary (1944\u20131945), R\u00e1kosi was appointed General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) (1945). He was a member of the High National Council from 27 September to 7 December 1945. R\u00e1kosi was deputy prime minister from 1945 to 1949, and was acting Prime Minister from 1 to 4 February 1946 and on 31 May 1947. Initially, R\u00e1kosi and the Communists appeared willing to work within the system. From 1947 onwards, however, he and the Communists began pressuring the other parties to exclude those not willing to work with the Communists on the grounds that they were \"fascists\" or fascist sympathisers. Later on, after the Communists won complete control. It was commonly believed that R\u00e1kosi referred to this practice as \"salami tactics,\" saying he had destroyed the non-Communist forces in the country by \"cutting them off like slices of salami.\" However, no verified source for the \"salami\" quote has ever been discovered. According to historian Norman Stone, the term might have been invented by the leader of the Hungarian Independence Party Zolt\u00e1n Pfeiffer. The process began when Smallholder Party Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy was forced to resign in favour of a more pliant Smallholder, Lajos Dinny\u00e9s. By the 1947 elections, the Communists had won a majority, and had largely emasculated the next-largest non-Communist Party, the Social Democrats. By October 1947, R\u00e1kosi had dropped all pretense of multi-party democracy. He gave the non- Communist parties an ultimatum: cooperate with a new, Communist-dominated coalition government or go into exile.Hungary: a country study. Library of Congress Federal Research Division, December 1989. By the end of 1947, the opposition parties had largely shunted aside their more courageous members, leaving them in the hands of fellow travellers willing to do the Communists' bidding. In the summer of 1948, the Communists forced the Social Democrats to merge with them to form the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP). However, the few remaining independent-minded Social Democrats were quickly pushed out in short order, leaving the MDP as an enlarged MKP. He also pushed out the Smallholder president, Zolt\u00e1n Tildy, in favour of Social Democrat-turned- Communist \u00c1rp\u00e1d Szakasits, and forced Dinny\u00e9s to resign in favour of the openly pro-Communist Istv\u00e1n Dobi. A year later, elections took place with a single list of candidates. Although non-Communists nominally still figured, in reality they were fellow travellers. This marked the onset of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. R\u00e1kosi described himself as \"Stalin's best Hungarian disciple\" and \"Stalin's best pupil\". At the height of his rule, he developed a strong cult of personality around himself. Approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were purged under his rule, from 1948 to 1956.Johanna Granville, The First Domino: International Decision Making During the Hungarian Crisis of 1956\", Texas A & M University Press, 2004. . R\u00e1kosi imposed totalitarian rule on Hungary \u2014 arresting, jailing and killing both real and imagined foes in various waves of Stalin-inspired political purges. In August 1952, he also became Prime Minister (Chairman of the Council of Ministers). However, in June 1953, R\u00e1kosi and other party leaders were summoned to Moscow, where the Soviet leadership dressed down their Hungarian counterparts for Hungary's lackluster economic performance. On 13 June 1953, to appease the Soviet Politburo, R\u00e1kosi accepted the Soviet model of collective leadership. While he gave up the premiership to Imre Nagy, he retained the office of General Secretary. Nagy favoured a more humane way of governing, which R\u00e1kosi vigorously opposed. On 9 March 1955, the Central Committee of the MDP condemned Nagy for \"rightist deviation.\" Hungarian newspapers joined the attacks and Nagy was blamed for the country's economic problems. On 18 April, the National Assembly unanimously sacked Nagy from his post. Although the Kremlin frowned on a return of R\u00e1kosi to the premiership, he and Nagy's successor, Andr\u00e1s Heged\u00fcs, quickly put the country back on its previous Stalinist course. ===Economic policy=== R\u00e1kosi during the 2nd World Festival of Youth and Students. The post-war Hungarian economy suffered from multiple challenges. The most important was the destruction of infrastructure in the war (40% of national wealth, including all bridges, railways, raw materials, machinery, etc.).Pet\u0151-Szak\u00e1cs: A hazai gazdas\u00e1g n\u00e9gy \u00e9vtized\u00e9nek t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete 1945\u20131985. I. k\u00f6t. Budapest, 1985, KJK Hungary agreed to pay war reparations totalling approximately US$300 million, to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and to support Soviet garrisons. The Hungarian National Bank in 1946 estimated the cost of reparations as \"between 19 and 22 percent of the annual national income.\" In spite of this, after the highest historical rate of inflation in world history, a new, stable currency was successfully introduced in August 1946 on the basis of the plans of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. The low production of consumer goods and the backwardness of light industry resulted in frequent shortages, especially in the countryside, leading to discontent. In addition, the huge investments in military sectors after the outbreak of the Korean War further reduced the supply of consumer goods. Due to shortages, forced savings (state bond sales to the population) and below-inflation wage increases were introduced. ==Forced retirement== R\u00e1kosi's grave in Budapest R\u00e1kosi was then removed as General Secretary of the Party under pressure from the Soviet Politburo in June 1956 (shortly after Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech), and was replaced by his former second-in-command, Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151. To remove him from the Hungarian political scene, the Soviet Politburo forced R\u00e1kosi to move to the Soviet Union in 1956, with the official story being that he was \"seeking medical attention\". He spent the rest of his life in Soviet Kirghizia. Shortly before his death, R\u00e1kosi was in 1970 finally granted permission to return to Hungary if he promised not to engage in any political activities. He refused the deal and remained in the USSR where he died in Gorky in 1971. After his death, his ashes were privately returned to Hungary for burial in the Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery in Budapest. Only his initials are visible on the gravestone to avoid vandalism. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * * Category:1892 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Hungarian Communist Party politicians Category:Members of the Hungarian Working People's Party Category:Members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Category:Prime Ministers of Hungary Category:Hungarian People's Republic Category:Jewish Hungarian politicians Category:Jewish Prime Ministers Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1945\u20131947) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1947\u20131949) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1949\u20131953) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1953\u20131958) Category:Communist rulers Category:Hungarian Comintern people Category:Stalinism Category:Anti-revisionists Category:People from Ada, Serbia Category:Collaborators with the Soviet Union Category:20th-century atheists Category:Atheism activists Category:Jewish atheists Category:Jewish socialists Category:Hungarian atheists Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Hungarian prisoners of war Category:Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war in World War I Category:World War I prisoners of war held by Russia Category:Hungarian people of the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War Category:Hungarian expatriates in the Soviet Union Category:People of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 Category:Burials at Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery ",
