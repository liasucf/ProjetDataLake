    "text": "The New Croton Reservoir is a reservoir in Westchester County, New York, part of the New York City water supply system lying approximately north of New York City. It is the collecting point for water from all reservoirs in the Croton Watershed. ==History== In 1842 the Croton River, a tributary of the Hudson River, was impounded by the Old Croton Dam to create Croton Lake. New York City's first source of water beyond its city limits, its waters traveled by aqueduct to the Croton Distributing Reservoir in midtown Manhattan. In 1905 the New Croton Dam was completed, expanding the existing impoundment into the New Croton Reservoir, then the largest in the Croton Watershed, and thus one of the largest in the New York City water supply system to that point. It has a 57 square mile (148 km\u00b2) drainage basin, is approximately long, and can hold of water at full capacity. Its waters flow into the New Croton Aqueduct, then into the Jerome Park Reservoir in The Bronx. In Manhattan these are mixed with those of the Catskill aqueduct, the result flowing through the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island, termini of the distribution system. ==Gallery== File:CrotonReservoir.jpg|Perspective of the reservoir File:CrotonReservoirSystem.JPG|Water treatment at the reservoir File:CrotonReservoirPlaque.JPG|Plaque at the New Croton Aqueduct File:CrotonReservoirBridge.JPG|AMVETS Memorial Bridge - one of several bridges transversing the reservoir ==See also== *Old Croton Aqueduct *New Croton Aqueduct *List of reservoirs and dams in New York *New York City water supply system ==References== Category:Croton Watershed Category:Protected areas of Westchester County, New York Category:Reservoirs in Westchester County, New York Category:Reservoirs in New York (state) Category:Somers, New York Category:1842 establishments in New York (state) ",
