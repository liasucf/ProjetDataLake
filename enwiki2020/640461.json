    "text": "Notarchus is a genus of sea slugs or sea hares, marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares.Bouchet, P. (2012). Notarchus Cuvier, 1817. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=204962 on 11 June 2012 ==Description== The parapodia (fleshy winglike outgrowths) of Notarchus are almost completely fused, forming the parapodial cavity. ==Life habits== These sea hares are able to swim by jet propulsion, through sucking in water through the small anterior opening of the parapodial cavity and then squirting water from the back of it. While doing so, they tumble and make a series of backward somersaults. In this unusual manner, they move quickly out of harm's way over short distances. ==Species== Species within the genus Notarchus include: *Notarchus indicus Schweigger, 1820 : Indian sea hare **Distribution : in shallow waters of NW Indian Ocean, NW Pacific, Mediterranean. **Description : fine papillae scattered over the mantle; no armed penis; feeds on green alga Caulerpa. *Notarchus punctatus Philippi, 1836 **Distribution : Japan, Indo- Chinese seas, Mediterranean. **Length : 5 cm **Description : penis with spines.
