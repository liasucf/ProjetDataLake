    "text": "List of closed railway stations in London lists closed heavy rail passenger stations within the Greater London area. Stations served only by London Underground or its predecessors, by Tramlink, and by the Docklands Light Railway are not included. ==Scope== Each station has a major place name and a railway reference which is generally the founding company but it may be another interested company or a line. The stations' linked articles give more details. The full form of an abbreviation is seen by rolling over; linkage to \"unwritten\" articles and repeated linkage are retained to allow that. \"Replacement\" is either a station which took over directly one closed, as King's Cross for Maiden Lane, or one built later at the same location as some DLR stations were, \"+/-\" after a replacement's name indicates that it was near the disused station but slightly displaced along the same path. Stations not replaced are marked \"None\". Stations with the same name are differentiated, usually by company abbreviations as superscripts. \u00a7 after a station name means renamed before closure. Some stations were renamed several times. \u25ba after a replacement station means \"later renamed as\". after a replacement name indicates a Tramlink tram stop rather than a station. \u2020 after a grid reference shows site was not identified, only inferred from street names etc. ==Stations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name at closure !Place !Replacement !Opened !Closed to passengers !Railway reference !Reference if not Wikipedia !Grid reference |- |\u00a7 |Addiscombe |None |1864 |1997 |MKR |Southern Electric Group Addiscombe Branch www.tboa.co.uk | |- |Alexandra Palace (MHR) |Muswell Hill |None |1873 |1954 |MHR |Wall (2003) | |- |Angel Road\u00a7 |Edmonton |Meridian Water |1840 |2019 |N&ER; | | |- | |Wallington |None |1906 |1914 |LB&SCR; |Mitchell & Smith (1992) | |- |Bath Road Halt |Chiswick |None |1909 |1917 |N&SWJR; | | |- |Battersea (WLER) |Battersea |None |1863 |1940 |WLL |Course (1962) | |- |Battersea Park |Battersea |Grosvenor Road (LB&SCR; side) |1860 |1870 |LB&SCR; |Originally \"Battersea\", Marshall (1963) has \"Battersea\" but Course (1962) has \"Battersea Park and Steamboat Pier\" | |- | |Battersea |Battersea Park |1867 |1916 |LC&DR; |Course (1962) | |- |Battersea Wharf (LB&SC;) |Battersea | |1858 |?1860 |WEL&CPR; | | |- | |Beckton |Beckton (DLR) +/- |1874 |1940 |EC&TJR; |Jackson (1978) | |- |\u00a7 |Beddington |Beddington Lane |1855 |1997 |W&CR; |Marshall (1963) | |- |Belmont\u00a7 |Belmont, Harrow |None |1932 |1964 |L&NWR; |Course (1962) | |- | |Addiscombe |Addiscombe +/- |1906 |1983 |W&SCR; | | |- | (First site)\u00a7 |Shoreditch |L'pool St/B'gate (LL) |1840 |1879 |ECR | | |- |Bishopsgate (ex Low Level)\u00a7 |Shoreditch |None |1872 |1916 |GER | | |- | |Southwark |Blackfriars |1864 |1885 |LCDR | | |- |Blackfriars Road |Southwark |Waterloo Junction \u25ba Waterloo East |1864 |1868 |SER |Course (1962) | |- | |Greenwich |None |1871 |1917 |LC&DR; | | |- | |E.
