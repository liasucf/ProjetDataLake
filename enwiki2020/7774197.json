Following World War II and establishment of Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, it re-established operation as \"Komunalna banka\" in 1955. In 1970, the bank was merged into the state owned \"Jugobanka\". ===1991\u20132016=== In July 1991, in the midst of the breakup of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it started operating independently within Jugobanka system as \"Jugobanka Jubanka\" a.d.
