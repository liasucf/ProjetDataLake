Fields, p. 2 The bibliographic database IDEAS/RePEc lists him among the top 5% authors in economics according to a number of metrics, e.g. average rank score and number of citations.Statistics of Gary S. Fields' profile on IDEAS/RePEc His most-cited research article, published in 1975, analyzes the unemployment and underemployment in least developed countries in a quantity adjustment framework by making extensions to the Harris-Todaro model of rural-urban migration, namely (1) allowances for more generalized job search behavior, an urban traditional sector, preferential hiring by educational level, and labor turnover considerations. A predicted unemployment rate much lower than in the initial model and more in line with empirical observations is the result of these modifications, explaining the appeal of Fields' labor market model in development economics.Fields, G.S. (1975). Rural-urban migration, urban unemployment and underemployment, and job-search activity in LDCs. Journal of Development Economics, 2(2), pp. 165-187. In another highly cited article, co-authored with Efe A. Ok and published in 1996, Fields defines the concept of income mobility and develops a measure of income mobility which is additively decomposable into its two sources, namely the transfer of income among individuals within a given structure and the change in total income, e.g. due to economic growth or contraction.Fields, G.S., Ok, E.A. (1996). The Meaning and Measurement of Income Mobility. Journal of Economic Theory, 71(2), pp. 349-377. His most recent work centers on the working poor, defined as individuals working (often as self-employed) but earning less than $2 (PPP) per day, and their attempts to enter wage-paying employment or improve their earnings within self-employment.Gary Fields: The link between jobs, unemployment, and poverty.
