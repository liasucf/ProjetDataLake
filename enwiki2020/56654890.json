In their fourth season under head coach Buck Shaw, the Broncos compiled a 5\u20131\u20133 record, outscored opponents by a total of 117 to 40, and were ranked No. 14 in the final AP Poll. After going winless in its first three games (one loss and two ties), the team went undefeated in the final six games, including victories over Purdue, Stanford, and Michigan State, and a scoreless tie with No. 11 UCLA. Santa Clara center John Schiechl was a consensus pick on the 1939 College Football All-America Team. End Bill Anahu was named to the second team by the International News Service.
