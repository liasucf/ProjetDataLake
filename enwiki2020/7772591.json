    "text": "Harakah is a newspaper founded in 1987 and published by PAS. In addition to using the Malay language, the paper includes an 8-page English language pullout consisting of pages and columns written in English called the English Section. A page in Jawi writing was introduced in 2007. Articles from Harakah are also available through its own website, Harakahdaily.net. == Overview == The circulation of Harakah broke new heights during the post-Anwar sacking by Mahathir in the late 1990s. This has caused printing permit, which for years had allowed publication twice a week, to be changed to twice a month by the Barisan Nasional-dominated government of Malaysia. Harakah's current Managing Director is Dato' Kamarudin Jaffar. Currently helmed by Ahmad Lutfi Othman who was appointed its editor-in-chief in 2006, its former editor-in-chiefs include Zulkifli Sulong and Suhaimi Taib. Its internet wing edition, Harakahdaily.net, is headed by Mohd Rashidi Hassan. One of the better known contributors to Harakah was M. G. G. Pillai, who coined the term \"Darul Casino\". He died in 2006. During the 52nd PAS Youth Muktamar which was held in November 2012, Nasrudin Hassan of PAS Youth demanded that the editorial line-up of the newspaper should be restructured and wants a committee to be set up to censor the editorial content of the newspaper and its online portal Harakahdaily. PAS Youth claims that the newspaper has lost its credibility and derailed from its own purpose. Nasrudin claims that it no longer carries the aspiration of the jamaah to propel the Islamic movement of the 21st century. PAS later accepted the resolution without debate. == References == == External links == * * englishsection.com: Official English Section website * Hharakahdaily.my - Harakah Daily Blog Edition Category:English-language newspapers published in Asia Category:Malay-language newspapers Category:Newspapers published in Malaysia Category:Bilingual newspapers Category:Publications established in 1987 ",
