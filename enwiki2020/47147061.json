    "text": "The A11 motorway () is a partially built motorway in north-western part of Romania, planned to connect the cities of Arad and Oradea. As of July 2015, the only operational segment is a section from Arad West Interchange (A1) to DN7 (Arad North), known as the Arad Bypass (). The current segment in service was built as part of the Arad Bypass section of the A1 motorway, that was opened in December 2011 (on a single carriageway) and June 2012 (on both carriageways). In July 2015, when the Arad \u2013 N\u0103dlac section of the A1 motorway became operational, it changed its route number from A1 to A11. The motorway is planned to be extended towards Oradea and connected to the A3 motorway. ==Exit list== {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse;\" |- |colspan=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffffff;background- color:green; text-align: center;\"|Exits and buildings (Northbound) |- |Interchange |km 0 |Arad West Interchange: N\u0103dlac / Timi\u0219oara |A1 |opened 2011, reconfigured in July 2015 as interchange |- |Exit |km 3 |Arad North |DN7 |opened 2011 |} ==References== Category:Motorways in Romania ",
