He is regarded in Lithuania as a National Hero. Kudirka used pen names V. Kapsas, Pae\u017eeri\u0173 Vincas, Vincas Kapsas, P.Vincas, Varpas, Q.D, K., V.K, Perk\u016bnas. Kudirka was born in Pae\u017eeriai, in the August\u00f3w Governorate of Congress Poland (present-day Lithuania). He began studying history and philosophy in Warsaw in 1881, but changed his major and began studying medicine the following year. During his studies, he was arrested as a subversive for having a copy of Das Kapital in his possession, and was expelled from the University of Warsaw, but later re- admitted. He graduated in 1889, and worked as a country doctor in \u0160akiai and Naumiestis. Kudirka began writing poetry in 1888. Simultaneously he became more active in the Lithuanian national rebirth movement. Together with other Lithuanian students in Warsaw, he founded the secret society Lietuva (\"Lithuania\"). The following year the society began publishing the clandestine newspaper Varpas (\"The Bell\"), which Kudirka edited and contributed to for the next ten years. In issue number 6 of Varpas, in September 1898, he published the text of Tauti\u0161ka Giesm\u0117, which would officially become in 1918, the Lithuanian National Anthem, set to music written by Kudirka himself. Kudirka gave much to Lithuanian culture, and also published a collection of Lithuanian popular songs. He was also a noted writer of satire. He died of tuberculosis at Naumiestis, on 16 November 1899, at age 40. The second half of Tauti\u0161ka Giesm\u0117 was engraved on his gravestone. On 5 July 2009, a statue of Vincas Kudirka was unveiled beside the Gediminas Avenue, the main street of the capital Vilnius. The unveiling, by dignitaries, including the Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, coincided with festivities marking the 1000th anniversary of the first time Lithuania was mentioned in official chronicles. == References == Category:1858 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Vilkavi\u0161kis District Municipality Category:People from August\u00f3w Governorate Category:Lithuanian poets Category:Lithuanian writers Category:Lithuanian physicians Category:Lithuanian classical composers Category:National anthem writers Category:Male classical composers Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century poets Category:19th-century male musicians Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis ",
