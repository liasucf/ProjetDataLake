    "text": "Walnut Creek is an elevated BART station in Walnut Creek, California, on the Antioch\u2013SFO/Millbrae line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. The station is located north of downtown Walnut Creek, adjacent to Interstate 680 and near the Ygnacio Valley Road and California Boulevard arterial roads. ==History== The completed south garage in 2019 Walnut Creek station opened on May 21, 1973 as part of an extension from MacArthur to Concord. Due to Walnut Creek's high ridership and large catchment area, BART proposed in 2004 that the station be the center of a transit-oriented development scheme which includes 440 residential units, of office space, of retail space, and 1,373 parking spaces. A parking lot on the west side of the station closed on February 3, 2018. A 900-space parking garage was constructed in its place, which allowed other parking lots to be closed for the new development. The new garage, which includes a three-lane bus plaza, opened on March 29, 2019. ==Station layout== Walnut Creek station has two side platforms with two tracks. Access to the tracks is provided by a staircase, escalator, and elevator from the mezzanine, which houses nine faregates. Sustained patronage at the station has caused it to become overcrowded; BART is planning on building a second entrance, including new faregates and platform access to relieve possible emergency hazards. ==Bus connections== A County Connection bus at the station Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa Centre is a transfer point for a number of County Connection local and express routes: *Weekday: 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 21, 93X, 95X, 96X, 98X *Weekend: 311, 321 *Special school routes: 601, 602 *Early Bird Express: 715 The station is also served by several longer-distance routes from other transit agencies: SolTrans Solano Express Yellow Line and WHEELS route 70X.
