The wingspan is about 38 mm for males 48 mm for females. Adults are similar to Auzata superba, but all the wings have a double antemedial pale fuscous line and an interrupted submarginal band of the same colour. The hindwings have a patch as on the forewings. The fringes of all wings are pale fuscous, interrupted with white at the ends of the nervules.Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. 1898 (3): 362 ==Subspecies== *Auzata chinensis chinensis (China: Hunan, Sichuan) *Auzata chinensis prolixa Watson, 1959 (China: Zhejiang) *Auzata chinensis arcuata Watson, 1959 (China: southern Shaanxi, Sichuan) ==References== Category:Moths described in 1898 Category:Drepaninae Category:Moths of China ",
