    "text": "Atlantic Coast Conference logo in Miami's colors The Miami Hurricanes (known informally as The U, UM, UMiami, or The 'Canes) are the intercollegiate varsity sports teams that represent the University of Miami, located in the Coral Gables suburb of Miami, Florida. In box scores for sporting events, the Hurricanes sports teams are usually referred to as Miami (FL) to differentiate from the Miami RedHawks, an NCAA Division I school located in Oxford, Ohio. They compete in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The university fields 15 athletic teams for 17 varsity sports. Men's teams compete in baseball, basketball, cross-country, diving, football, tennis, and track and field. Women's teams compete in basketball, cross-country, swimming and diving, golf, rowing, soccer, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. UM has approximately equal participation by male and female varsity athletes in these sports. The athletic department's colors are orange, green, and white. The school mascot is Sebastian the Ibis. The ibis was selected as the school's mascot because, according to university legend, it is the last animal to flee an approaching hurricane and the first to reappear after the storm, making it a symbol of leadership and courage. The school's athletics logo is a simple green and orange, color of an orange tree, letter \"U.\" The school's marching band is the Band of the Hour. Aside from being an independent in baseball, the Hurricanes were a full member of the Big East Conference from 1991 to 2004. In 2004, the school became a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Cross country || Golf |- | Diving || Rowing |- | Football || Soccer |- | Tennis || Swimming & diving |- | Track and field\u2020 || Tennis |- | || Track and field\u2020 |- | || Volleyball |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} ===Baseball=== The home venue for Miami Hurricanes baseball is Mark Light Field at Alex Rodriguez Park on the campus of the University of Miami. UM has won four national championships (1982, 1985, 1999 and 2001) and reached the College World Series 22 times in the 34 seasons since 1974. Five UM graduates are currently active on MLB teams. The team is currently coached by Jim Morris, the former head coach of the Georgia Tech baseball team. Former coach Ron Fraser was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in July 2006. The team plays its games on the UM campus, in Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field. Morris' contract as coach has been extended through 2015. Morris has established a record of 850\u2013344\u20133 (.711) in 19 seasons at Miami. His teams reached the College World Series in his first six seasons at UM, an NCAA record. The Mascot for the baseball team is The Miami Maniac. Miami holds the longest consecutive post season appearance streak at 44 consecutive years (1973\u20132016). This streak is the longest of any men's NCAA Div. 1 major sport, topping the football post season streak of 35 seasons (Nebraska 1972\u20132006) and the basketball streak of 27 seasons (North Carolina 1974\u20132001). ===Men's basketball=== The Watsco Center on the University of Miami campus is the home arena of the Hurricanes' men's and women's basketball teams. The Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team has produced three players who are currently on NBA rosters. Rick Barry, who played his collegiate basketball at UM, is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. Barry is the Hurricanes' only consensus All-American in basketball and led the nation in scoring his senior year with a 37.4 average during the 1964\u201365 campaign. The team plays its home games at the Watsco Center on the University of Miami's Coral Gables campus. The Board of Trustees attempted to shut the program down in the middle of the 1970 season, which forced Will Allen to organize his teammates and strike because it was not sufficient notice for the players to transfer schools. They held a press conference and this caught the attention of the national press, and the university actually dropped the program after the 1971 season, with the board citing inadequate facilities, sagging attendance, and serious financial losses as the reasons for the decision. The program was revived before the 1985\u201386 season, though UM would be minimally competitive over the next several years. The program's fortunes turned around in 1990 when Miami hired Leonard Hamilton as head basketball coach and accepted an invitation to join the Big East. By the end of the decade, Hamilton had turned UM into one of the better basketball programs in the Big East and had guided UM to three straight NCAA tournament appearances (1998\u20132000), including a #2 seed in the 1999 tournament and a Sweet 16 appearance in 2000. The 1998 tournament appearance was UM's first since 1960. Hamilton left at the end of the 2000 season to become head coach of the NBA's Washington Wizards and was replaced by Perry Clark. During Clark's second season (2001\u201302) the team won 24 games and a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament. With the 2002\u201303 season, the team moved into its newly completed on-campus arena, the Watsco Center. Despite a win over powerhouse North Carolina to christen the new arena, Clark's teams performed woefully over the next two seasons, leading to his dismissal following the 2003\u201304 season (UM's last season in the Big East). Clark was replaced by Frank Haith, whose teams were competitive in UM's first two seasons as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. In the 2007/2008 season, after being picked to finish last in the Atlantic Coast Conference the Hurricanes finished the year 23\u201311 (8\u20138 in the ACC) and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament before falling to the second seeded University of Texas at Austin. This was the team's first NCAA tournament bid since the 2001\u20132002 season. For the 2009/2010 season, Miami had a winning record overall (20\u201313), but finished in last place in the ACC with a record of 4\u201312. On April 4, 2011, Miami coach Frank Haith accepted a head coaching position at the University of Missouri. On April 22, 2011, George Mason Patriots head coach Jim Larranaga accepted the head coaching position after coaching the Patriots for 14 seasons. For the 2012\u20132013 season, Miami (FL) knocked down No. 1 Duke 90-63, won their first 13 ACC games, and attained the highest AP ranking in school history, attaining a #2 ranking. However, the Hurricanes lost to Wake Forest, 80-65, ruining at the time, a perfect record in ACC play. Miami clinched an ACC regular season title with a home triumph over Clemson. Miami entered the ACC Tournament as the #1 seed, and won said tournament with a win over the North Carolina Tar Heels. Thanks to this very successful season, multiple members of the program were recognized. Starting point guard Shane Larkin was named the ACC Player of the Year, senior shooting guard Durand Scott was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year, and Jim Larranaga was named the ACC Coach of the Year. Miami (FL) was selected to be the No. 2 seed in East Region of the NCAA Tournament. Their first opponent would be Pacific University. They defeated the Tigers 78-49. Their next opponent would be the University of Illinois. They defeated the Fighting Illini 63-59, allowing them to advance into the Regional Semifinals, where they would lose to Marquette ===Women's basketball=== UM forward Shenise Johnson, during the summer of 2009, competed on the gold medal-winning USA Team at the 2009 U19 World Championships.Johnson Records Double-Double in Team USA's Gold Medal Win \u2013 MIAMI OFFICIAL ATHLETIC SITE . Hurricanesports.cstv.com (August 2, 2009). Retrieved on November 26, 2010. The team plays its home games at the Watsco Center on the University of Miami's Coral Gables campus. In 2009\u201310, Miami finished last in the ACC. A year later, the Lady Canes went 26\u20133 (12\u20132 ACC) in the regular season to finish alongside Duke as regular season ACC champions. Miami went undefeated at the Watsco Center extending their home winning streak to 24 straight games. Despite a quarterfinal exit in the ACC Tournament, Miami's performance was enough to merit the program's first NCAA tournament bid since 1992. After cruising past Gardner\u2013Webb in the first round, they lost to Oklahoma in the second. Head coach Katie Meier won National Coach of the Year, along with Connecticut's Geno Auriemma and Stanford's Tara VanDerveer. Junior guards Shenice Johnson and Riquana Williams were named to the All-ACC first team, sophomore forward Morgan Stroman was named to the all-conference third team, and Johnson was a third-team All- American. The 2011\u201312 team returned every player from the 2010\u201311 squad and was picked in the preseason to win the ACC, though they finished 2nd. In the past seasons (2010\u201311 to 2015\u201316), they have made the NCAA Tournament five times. ===Cross country=== On July 22, 2008, Amy Deem was promoted to Director of Track and Field/Cross Country and heads both the men's and women's cross country running programs.

Shalala wrote of her support in a Miami Herald column on the 30th anniversary of that law. However, in the past, female athletes filed complaints with the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s alleging unequal funding and facilities for UM women's sports. Of the $46.8 million in annual athletic expenditures, $23.9 million were spent on men's team, $9.8 million were spent on women's teams, and $13 million can not be allocated based on gender. Miami has notable differences between the graduation rates of male and female student athletes. , UM graduation rates had 70% graduating within 4 years, 80% graduating within 5 years, and 82% graduating within 6 years. Male student athletes have a 57% graduation rate, and 67% of female student athletes graduate. Some critics of Miami's allocation of fiscal resources within the Athletics Department have blamed the decision to drop certain men's teams on Title IX compliance. ==Rivalries== Miami's traditional athletic rivals include the Seminoles of Florida State University and the Gators of the University of Florida. The Hurricanes have played more football games against the Seminoles (60) than against any other opponent (Florida being second with 55 games); the series began in 1951, and has been played annually since 1969. The teams' only bowl meeting was the 2004 Orange Bowl, prior to Miami leaving the Big East Conference to join the Atlantic Coast Conference (in which Florida State has been a member since 1992.) As of the 2019 meeting, the Hurricanes hold a 34\u201330 series lead against the Seminoles. The Hurricanes first played the Gators in football in 1938; and the teams played annually (except in 1943 when Florida didn't field a team due lack of players due to World War II) until 1987. Since then, Miami and Florida have met only six times (four during the regular season in 2002, 2003, 2008, and 2013, and in two bowl games: the 2001 Sugar Bowl and the 2004 Chick-fil-A Bowl).
