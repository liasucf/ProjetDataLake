Our Two Skins has been nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album at the ARIA Awards of 2020. ==Singles== On 25 February 2020, the first single \"Sandwiches\" was released. The single is inspired by the loss of Payten's grandmother. The second single \"Aeroplane Bathroom\", which was accompanied by the announcement of the new album, was released on 24 March 2020. In a press release, Payten explained the title of the single comes from how she felt \"isolated\" on an aeroplane and locked herself in the bathroom. The music video for the single, which was directed by Kasimir Burgess, was filmed at an abandoned Aircraft boneyard just outside Bangkok, Thailand. On 6 May 2020, the third single \"Volcanic\" was released. The single was written in 2018 in Stockholm, and focuses on Payten struggling with her sexual identity and her parents requesting her to share it with her ailed grandmother.

The fifth single \"Extraordinary Life\" was released on 23 June 2020, and was filmed in Bangkok at the same time of making \"Aeroplane Bathroom\". Payten explained the origins of the single: \"I began recording the demo in stairwells across Europe while I was on tour with Asgeir and in most of the demo vocals you can hear distant chatter in Icelandic\". ==Critical reception== Our Two Skins was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 79, based on 7 reviews. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Chart performance for Our Two Skins |- !
