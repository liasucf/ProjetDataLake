Anil Kadiyala and Tirumal Reddy produced the film under the banner \"SG Movie Makers\". The soundtrack was composed by Chaitan Bharadwaj, who also composed Kartikeya's RX 100. The film is based on a true story and was released on 2 August 2019 to mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== Gaddala Gunta Radha gets revenge on a villager who killed a member of Radha's gang. In anger, Radha proceeds to beat the man's parents. He then warns nearby villagers that anyone who disrespects him will suffer the same consequences. Then, a man is shown walking into a medical shop to purchase condoms. The shop owner takes a photo of the man and his girlfriend leaving on a scooter and sends it to Sashi's gang; who later tracks the couple down and rapes the girl. Guna is a non-violent man who works with his closest friend Butta at a granite factory. While riding a scooter to attend to his B. Tech exams, Guna meets Geetha and falls in love with her at first sight. To see Geetha, who works at a phone store, Guna repeatedly causes his phone to malfunction. The love-struck Guna persistently showers Geetha with compliments, which eventually results in Geetha reciprocating Guna\u2019s love. She tells him: \u201cUntil now, the best part of my life has been my family. From now on, it\u2019s you.\u201d Guna finds an online photo of Sashi, who had attended school with Butta. Guna believes that Sashi may be a good romantic match for his sister. Together, Guna and his sister visit Sashi at the medical shop Sashi owns. After the visit, Guna is convinced that Sashi is a good man and a perfect match for his sister. Later, while drinking at a dhaba, Sashi and his gang get into a brawl with Radha. Upon realizing that it is Radha, they immediately flee. When Sashi learns that Guna has known Radha since childhood, he pleads for Guna\u2019s help. Guna agrees and arranges a meeting with Radha at the granite quarry so that Sashi can apologize to Radha. Radha arrives alone and viciously slaps Sashi across the face several times, though Guna asks Radha to stop. A bottle is thrown from across a barricade which hits Radha\u2019s head. Unknown to Guna or Radha, Sashi\u2019s gang had planned to kill Radha in an ambush. As Sachi's gang holds Guna down, Sashi slashes at Radha and eventually beheads him. Guna is later jailed for being an accessory to the murder, while Sashi is able to avoid any charges. Upon release, Guna is shunned by his neighbors. Guna goes to Geetha\u2019s house but then learns she passed away while he was imprisoned. Her father falsely tells Guna that Geetha renounced their engagement before she died, and stating she did not want to marry a felon. At home, an enraged Guna tells his father that he will take revenge on the real killers of Radha. He visits Geetha's house, where he and his family are attacked by Radha\u2019s henchmen. Although Guna prevails, Guna's father ends up in the hospital, injured. Guna loads the injured Radha's men into a jeep and takes them to Radha\u2019s mother, where he explains to her that he did not kill her son. Radha's mother gives Guna one week to bring Sashi's gang to her. Guna finds Sashi\u2019s men hiding in a police house and attacks them. In the following scene, Guna is seen drinking on a beach with Butta. Guna calls his father to tell him that he will go back to jail for what he is about to do to the Sashi gang. Butta berates Guna, advising him to hand the killers over to Radha's mother instead. Guna reveals that the SI said Butta had encouraged Sashi to kill Radha. Butta replies that Radha has humiliated his family, revealing that he was the villager whose parents were beaten in the opening scene. Guna says he also learned that Geetha had come to Butta for advice about her father\u2019s insistence to marry someone else. Instead of advising her, Butta and Sashi recorded all of them raping her. Fearing the consequences of the video\u2019s release, and the potential for blackmail, Geetha committed suicide. Forced by Guna, SI films Guna beheading Sashi\u2019s six gang members. Then, to make Sashi and Butta suffer, he chops off their limbs. Guna surrenders to the police but is then praised for killing the rapists. The movie ends with Guna being released from jail and sets off to look for a new life. == Cast == * Kartikeya Gummakonda as Guna * Anagha as Gita * Naresh as Karthikeya's father * Hema as Karthikeya's mother * Kaumudi Nemani as Karthikeya's sister * Saakshi Siva as Gita's father * Adhitya as Radha * Manju Bhargavi as Radha's mother * Mahesh Achanta as Guna's friend * Sivaji Raja as SI == Soundtrack == == Reception == The Hans India described the film as average. The paper noted problems with the story line and described it as a \"routine commercial formula.\" Neeshita Nyayapati of Times of India gave the movie 2 out of 5 and wrote, \u2033With every story of Karthikeya different from his last, Guna 369 is one such attempt where he tries to pick a script and character that he hasn\u2019t done before. But unfortunately for him, these films also depend on the director\u2019s narrative, which is where his latest offering falters.\u2033 == References == == External links == * *Guna 369 on Netflix Category:2010s Telugu-language films Category:Indian films Category:2010s action drama films Category:Indian action drama films Category:2019 films Category:Indian films based on actual events Category:2019 drama films ",
