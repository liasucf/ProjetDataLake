The storyline was created in a bid to gain ratings. Spelling's character becomes trapped under water with on-screen love interest Emily Davis (Cristi Harris).

While Spelling was dropped down an eighty degree incline wall into a water tank. Then had to tread water, until he and Harris dove down wearing formal clothes, into the safety of an air shaft. Spelling said that they found the experience \"really disorienting\". ==Storylines== Sean is the son of Gregory (Sam Behrens) and Olivia Richards (Lesley-Anne Down) who always tried to find his way into life. He started a romance with Tiffany Thorne (Adrienne Frantz) and found himself in a triangle with Tiffany and Mark Wolper (Nick Stabile) he battled for her love, although it turned out that she was a gold digger. At the time, Sean was involved in a Del Douglas (John Reilly) murder mystery, when he saw a woman leaving his apartment on the night of the murder. It was eventually revealed that the person was Elaine Stevens (Leigh Taylor-Young) Sean and Tiffany became closer, but when Olivia offered money to Tiffany to get out town, she accepted it and left. The next few months, Sean was involved in a storyline in which Gregory tried to get rid of Cole, but he soon learned the truth, realizing that his father was lying to him all the time. In December 1997, Sean asked his ex- girlfriend, Elizabeth to attend a New Year's Eve party on an island and she accepted, but a mysterious killer murdered her on the boat. Sean thought Elizabeth didn't want to come, so he invited another girl, Amy Nielsen (Krissy Carlson) both Amy and Sean survived the Terror Island storyline, but it took a lot of time for Amy to get through what she experienced.
