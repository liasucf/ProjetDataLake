    "text": "In mathematics, a distance-regular graph is a regular graph such that for any two vertices v and w, the number of vertices at distance j from v and at distance k from w depends only upon j, k, and i = d(v, w). Every distance- transitive graph is distance-regular. Indeed, distance-regular graphs were introduced as a combinatorial generalization of distance-transitive graphs, having the numerical regularity properties of the latter without necessarily having a large automorphism group. ==Intersection arrays== It turns out that a graph G of diameter d is distance-regular if and only if there is an array of integers \\\\{ b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{d-1}; c_1, \\ldots, c_d \\\\} such that for all 1 \\leq j \\leq d , b_j gives the number of neighbours of u at distance j+1 from v and c_j gives the number of neighbours of u at distance j - 1 from v for any pair of vertices u and v at distance j on G . The array of integers characterizing a distance-regular graph is known as its intersection array. === Cospectral distance-regular graphs === A pair of connected distance-regular graphs are cospectral if and only if they have the same intersection array. A distance-regular graph is disconnected if and only if it is a disjoint union of cospectral distance-regular graphs. ==Properties== Suppose G is a connected distance-regular graph of valency k with intersection array \\\\{ b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{d-1}; c_1, \\ldots, c_d \\\\} . For all 0 \\leq j \\leq d : let G_{j} denote the k_{j} -regular graph with adjacency matrix A_j formed by relating pairs of vertices on G at distance j , and let a_j denote the number of neighbours of u at distance j from v for any pair of vertices u and v at distance j on G . === Graph-theoretic properties === * \\frac{k_{j+1}}{k_{j}} = \\frac{b_{j}}{c_{j+1}} for all 0 \\leq j < d . * b_0 > b_1 \\geq \\cdots \\geq b_{d-1} > 0 and 1 = c_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq c_d \\leq b_0 . === Spectral properties === *k \\leq \\frac{1}{2} (m - 1)(m + 2) for any eigenvalue multiplicity m > 1 of G, unless G is a complete multipartite graph. *d \\leq 3m - 4 for any eigenvalue multiplicity m > 1 of G, unless G is a cycle graph or a complete multipartite graph. *\\lambda \\in \\\\{ \\pm k \\\\} if \\lambda is a simple eigenvalue of G . *G has d + 1 distinct eigenvalues. If G is strongly regular, then n \\leq 4m - 1 and k \\leq 2m - 1. ==Examples== Some first examples of distance-regular graphs include: * The complete graphs. * The cycles graphs. * The odd graphs. * The Moore graphs. * The collinearity graph of a regular near polygon. * The Wells graph and the Sylvester graph. * * Strongly regular graphs of diameter 2. == Classification of distance-regular graphs == There are only finitely many distinct connected distance-regular graphs of any given valency k > 2. Similarly, there are only finitely many distinct connected distance-regular graphs with any given eigenvalue multiplicity m > 2 (with the exception of the complete multipartite graphs). === Cubic distance-regular graphs === The cubic distance-regular graphs have been completely classified. The 13 distinct cubic distance-regular graphs are K4 (or tetrahedron), K3,3, the Petersen graph, the cube, the Heawood graph, the Pappus graph, the Coxeter graph, the Tutte\u2013Coxeter graph, the dodecahedron, the Desargues graph, Tutte 12-cage, the Biggs\u2013Smith graph, and the Foster graph. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Algebraic graph theory Category:Graph families Category:Regular graphs ",
