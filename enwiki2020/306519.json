    "text": "Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fl\u00e4ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Capital and largest city is Wittenberg, a UNESCO world heritage. == History == In 1994 the district was merged with the district of Jessen and a small part of the district of Gr\u00e4fenhainichen. In 2007, 27 municipalities from the former district Anhalt-Zerbst were added to the district of Wittenberg. == Geography == The main rivers in the district are the Elbe and its tributary, the Schwarze Elster. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms show two swords which is the symbol of a field marshal in the Holy Roman Empire. This title was bestowed upon the counts of Saxony, who therefore added the symbol to their coat of arms. The center of the principality of Saxony was located in the area now covered by the district. == Towns and municipalities == The district of Wittenberg consists of the following towns: #Annaburg #Bad Schmiedeberg #Coswig #Gr\u00e4fenhainichen #Jessen (Elster) #Kemberg #Oranienbaum- W\u00f6rlitz #Wittenberg #Zahna-Elster After the resolution of 6 October 2005, as part of municipal reform, the (then) 27 towns and municipalities of the former Verwaltungsgemeinschaften of Coswig and W\u00f6rlitzer Winkel, formerly in the Anhalt-Zerbst district, were assigned to Wittenberg district on 1 July 2007. == Sights == File:Stadtkirche Wittenberg bei Nacht.jpg|Wittenberg market square with Stadtkirche Wittenberg File:Schlossstra\u00dfe Wittenberg 6336.JPG|Wittenberg old town with All Saints' Church under construction File:Jessen church.jpg|Jessen market square File:Coswig(Anhalt),Elbe,Schloss.jpg|Coswig view river Elbe File:Ferropolis Mainstage 360deg airpano.jpg|Ferropolis in Gr\u00e4fenhainichen File:Luftbild Oranienbaum.jpg|Oranienbaum aerial view File:W\u00f6rlitzer See mit St. Petri.jpg|The Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz Garden Realm File:Bergwitz, Bergwitzsee - Sonnenuntergang im September 2019.jpg| Bergwitz lake == External links == * ==References== Category:Districts of Saxony-Anhalt Category:Former states and territories of Saxony-Anhalt ",
