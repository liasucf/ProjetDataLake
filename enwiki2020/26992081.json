In, 1983, Mike Kelly showed \"one of his breakthrough works\", Monkey Island, \"a performance/installation\" which had been shown at Metro Pictures Gallery in New York the year prior. Later, in 1987, Mike Kelly had another notable exhibition, where he \"splayed blankets across\" Rosamund Felsen Gallery's \"floor and arranged tattered animals around them in formal groupings, like they were attending a picnic without people.\" The largest piece in this show, More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid, \"composed of animals and afghans and stretched 10 feet wide\" hung next to The Wages of Sin, \"a pedestal table dripping with candles in rainbow hues, as though audiences were standing before a holy shrine at mass, a nod to his Catholic upbringing.\" Both those pieces were in included in the Whitney Biennial that year and they were purchased by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The 1980s and the 90s also saw the additions of prominent women artists such Ren\u00e9e Petropoulos, Erika Rothenberg, Meg Cranston, Ann Preston, Joan Jonas, Marnie Weber, and Laura Owens, as well as male artists Tim Ebner and Jason Rhoades. ===1990s=== In 1990, after 12 years at the La Cienega site, Rosamund Felsen Gallery moved to West Hollywood on Santa Monica Boulevard to a space that had previously been the studio of entertainment photographer, Tom Kelley, and where Jason Rhoades had his first gallery exhibition, Swedish Erotica and Fiero Parts.

In 2012, for the gallery's end of the year show, Mary Kelly had a gallery exhibition which framed \"an epoch \u2014 the period from World War II through the Cold War \u2014 in a few shrewd conceptual strokes, employing as she often has in her work, the voice of the individual bystander as a mirror to the broader forces of history.\" From this exhibition, the piece Mimus, Act I (Posner) - which was \"made of sheets of compressed lint from domestic dryers affixed to variously colored cardboard\" using language which had been \"sourced from the court transcripts of the red-baiting House Committee on Un-American Activities and centers on the depositions of activists in the 1950s movement Women Strike for Peace.\" \\- was acquired by the Hammer Museum and would later be shown in the museum exhibition, Take It or Leave It: Institution, Image, Ideology, two years later.

Take It or Leave It would be \"the first large-scale exhibition to focus on the intersection of two vitally important genres of contemporary art: appropriation (taking and recasting existing images, forms, and styles from mass-media and fine art sources) and institutional critique (scrutinizing and confronting the structures and practices of our social, cultural, and political institutions).\" In 2015, Tanya Haden was added to the roster of exhibiting artists and had her first one-artist exhibition while gallery artist Joan Jonas was selected to represent the United States in at Venice Biennale 56th International Art Exhibition.

In June 2016, Rosamund Felsen Gallery announced that it would be closing its Downtown Los Angeles location with the show Celebration, slating it as a \u201ctribute not only to all the extraordinary artists who have filled both the gallery space and the gallery\u2019s identity over the years, but also as a marking point for the current gallery artists' ongoing careers.\u201d Celebration would include pieces by each of the Rosamund Felsen Gallery artists at the time. Rosamund Felsen Gallery continues to represent its artist and maintains a presence online.
