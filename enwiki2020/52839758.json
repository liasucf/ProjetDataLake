It is located south of the Lion of Waterloo, at Chauss\u00e9e de Bruxelles (Brussels high-road) 66, 1472 Genappe. Travelling north from Genappe the high-road passes pass over the Waterloo battlefield through Waterloo and on to Brussels. ==History== The burnt out shell of the house sketched by Robert Hills (1816). In 1815 the farmhouse belonged to S\u00e9ance de Caioux. Napoleon resided there on the night of the 17/18 of June 1815, and it is where Napoleon held his breakfast conference at which he told his marshals \"Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\". A day after the battle, the Prussians, vowing that it should never again harbour their former enemy, burnt the farmhouse. ==Museum== The house in 2011 photographed from a similar position to the sketch in 1816. The Lion Mound is visible on the horizon to left of the building. The museum houses unique pieces, such as the Emperor's camp bed and table he used during the campaign.
