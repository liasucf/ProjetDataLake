After spending his early life in Hyderabad, India, Howlett came to England to receive his scholarship for Diploma in Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. From 1950, he worked in England for the London Country Council before coming to Australia to work with several Perth\u2019s practices. Later, Howlett came to Melbourne to continue his career as a Senior Design architect with Bates Smart and Mc Cutcheon. In Melbourne, together with Donald Bailey, who soon to be his co-operator, they won the new Perth City Council administration buildings competition. The Howlett and Bailey Architects firm was constituted after that when they moved to Perth. Donald Bailey described Howlett as a specially talent and creative designer.

An exhibition at Perth Galleries in 2002 displayed his art works and told the story of his memories, past and present. ==Major Projects== ===Council House, Perth=== Because Perth was hosting the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1962, the Perth City Council decided to construct a new headquarters with a modern design to showcase the development of the state. Howlett and Bailey won the competition for the new administration building with their Council House design in 1960, out of 61 entries. The Council House was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony in 1963. The design reflects the minimalist modern style which influenced the new Perth City plan. It is 13 storeys with opening extension and relative lowness. The interior is designed to give maximum working space in relation to its gross area. The fa\u00e7ade is constructed with windows curtain system and T shape sun hoods which provide effective use of artificial and natural lighting. Council House became the pride of Perth citizens.
