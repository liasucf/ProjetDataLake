Ibarra Mu\u00f1oz was born in Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro, into a family led by David Ibarra, an engineer. He graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) with bachelor's degrees in Public Accounting (1952) and Economics (1957) and from Stanford University with a doctorate degree in Economics (1961).

When Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo assumed the presidency of Mexico, he served briefly as director-general of but was called on 17 November 1977 to substitute the Secretary of Finance, Julio Rodolfo Moctezuma. After failing to control inflation, facing a steep decline in oil prices and making, in his own words, \"a series of economic policy blunders\", he was asked to step down by the president on September 1982 (barely three months before the end of the presidential term) to chair the then-recently nationalized National Bank of Mexico (Banamex). ==References== Category:Mexican Secretaries of Finance Category:Stanford University alumni Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico faculty Category:Mexican economists Category:People from Quer\u00e9taro City Category:1930 births Category:Living people ",
