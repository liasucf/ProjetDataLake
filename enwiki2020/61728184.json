    "text": "Bougisidae is a family of plankton in the sub-order Hyperiidea \u2013 a type of so- called \"hyperid\" amphipoda.Wolfgang Zeidler, \"A review of the families and genera of the hyperiidean amphipod superfamily Phronimoidea Bowman & Gruner, 1973 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Hyperiidea)\", in: Zootaxa, nr 567, 2004, page 1-66.T E Bowman and H E Gruner, \"The families and genera of Hyperiidea (Crustacea: Amphipoda)\", in: Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, nr 146, 1973, page 1-64. Bougisidae is a monotypic taxon, meaning that it has only one subordinate taxon: the genus Bougisia, which itself contains only one species, B. ornata. This species lives as plankton in tropical and sub-tropical salt water. Hyperiidea species normally have a physique that differs from other types of amphipod. == Taxonomy == The taxonomy of Bougisia is complicated, and has been revised on a number of occasions, and different group affiliation is possible. Prior to 2004, the genera Iulopis and Bougisia were part of the family Hyperiidae, but Zeidler suggested creating two new families for the genera. The groups' taxonomy was updated in 2013.Lowry, J.K. and Myers, A.A, \"A Phylogeny and Classification of the Senticaudata subord. nov. (Crustacea: Amphipoda)\", in: Zootaxa nr 3610 (1), 2013, page 1-80. A modern updating of the system is based on the 2013 revision with its basis in the WoRMS-database. == References== Category:Amphipoda Category:Animals described in 2004 ",
