Captain Thomas Moffat acquired a letter of marque on 9 December 1799. He sailed Union from London on 26 December 1788. Union acquired her slaves at Accra and arrived at Demerara on 30 October 1800 with 384 slaves.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Union voyage #83897. On 15 January 1801, Union sailed from Demerara in company with , Watson, master,Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Union voyage #80239. and , Hensley, master.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Dart voyage #80967. Both were slave ships with letters of marque. All were carrying sugar, coffee, indigo, and cotton. During the voyage Union started to take on water so her crew transferred to Bolton. Then Bolton and Dart parted company in a gale.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.275. (Dart arrived back at Liverpool on 11 March.) On 5 March 1801 Bolton encountered the French privateer Gironde. Gironde was armed with 26 guns and had a complement of 260 men; reportedly, Bolton had 70 people (including passengers - presumably most of them the crew from Union), aboard her. Small arms fire from Gironde helped her overwhelm Boltons defences; Gironde then ran into Bolton and captured her. The engagement, which lasted about an hour, caused considerable damage to both ships. Two passengers on Bolton were killed, and six of her crew, including Captain Watson, were wounded; Gironde had no casualties. On 12 March recaptured Bolton, as Bolton was on her way to Bordeaux. Leda sent Bolton into Plymouth. Bolton arrived at Plymouth on 14 March. ==Citations and references== Citations References * Category:1799 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Slave ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1801 ",
