In accordance with the South African Constitution of 1961, the ceremonial State President was elected by a joint sitting of both houses of Parliament for a seven-year term. John Vorster won the election with 173 votes in his favor and 31 going to the other candidates, beginning his term on October 10, 1978. == Bibliography == Category:Presidential elections in South Africa Category:1978 in South Africa ",
