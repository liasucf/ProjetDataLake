    "text": "Christopher Levour \"Chris\" Warren (born January 19, 1981) is a Panamanian- American professional basketball player who last played for Panteras de Aguascalientes of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP). He is a 1.96 m (6 ft 5 in) tall shooting guard. ==College career== As a junior, Warren averaged 4.1 points per game off the bench for a University of South Carolina team that was the National Invitation Tournament runner up in the 2001\u201302 season. He increased his numbers the following year reaching 9.6 points per game. His game was not spectacular, but he earned the reputation of a solid defensive player who could also run the floor well and had a good first step. The latter offensive skill would prove to be more than accurate during his career in the Euroleague. ==Professional career== Not being drafted by any NBA team and being unknown in Europe, Warren signed for the 2003\u201304 season with the Mexican League club Panteras de Aguascalientes and won the Mexican championship. He started the following season with Chilean League club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica and then went back to Panteras de Aguascalientes. In January 2005 he played in Portugal four games for Oliveirense. In February 2005, he moved to Serbia and signed with Reflex \u017deleznik for the rest of the season. After that, he went back again to Mexico where he played for Mineros de Cananea and Tiburones Mazatl\u00e1n of the CIBACOPA. Warren's big opportunity came on February 2006, when he moved to Croatia for traditional powerhouse KK Cibona and played there until the end of the 2007\u201308 championship. With Cibona he won back to back Croatian Championships and had two great EuroLeague seasons, averaging 13.7 and 15.6 points per game. In July 2008, he signed with Scandone Avellino of Italy for the 2008\u201309 season. In June 2009, he signed with Bilbao Basket of Spain. He stayed with Bilbao till the summer of 2011, when he signed with Cedevita Zagreb of Croatia for the 2011\u201312 season. In August 2012, he returned to his former team Scandone Avellino. In November 2011, Avellino waived him after he had some problems with injuries. In September 2013, he signed with Bnei Herzliya of Israel for the 2013\u201314 season. In January 2015, Warren signed with Karpo\u0161 Sokoli of the Macedonian First League. In October 2015, Warren returned to Croatia for the third time, signing with KK Zabok of the Croatian A-1 Liga. In December 2015, he left Zabok and signed with his former team Panteras de Aguascalientes of the Mexican LNBP. In March 2016, he moved to the Argentinian club Obras Sanitarias. ==National team career== Warren is a member of the Panama national basketball team and won the bronze medal at the 2003 Centrobasket. He also played at the 2005 FIBA Americas Championship, finishing fifth. ==Career statistics== ===College=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2001\u201302 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| South Carolina | 36 || 0 || 13.4 || .343 || .323 || .775 || 2.2 || 0.9 || 0.4 || 0.1 || 4.1 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2002\u201303 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| South Carolina | 22 || 12 || 24.3 || .440 || .406 || .776 || 2.5 || 1.4 || 0.8 || 0.2 || 9.6 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Career | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 58 || 12 || 17.7 || .394 || .366 || .775 || 2.3 || 1.1 || 0.5 || 0.1 || 6.2 ===EuroLeague=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2005\u201306 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Cibona Zagreb | 6 || 6 || 21.7 || .543 || .545 || .714 || 3.3 || 0.2 || 0.3 || 0.7 || 8.2 || 6.2 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2006\u201307 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cibona Zagreb | 14 || 12 || 31.0 || .444 || .414 || .755 || 4.9 || 1.3 || 1.2 || 0.1 || 13.7 || 12.4 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2007\u201308 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cibona Zagreb | 14 || 13 || 31.6 || .458 || .394 || .804 || 4.6 || 1.8 || 1.5 || 0.1 || 15.6 || 16.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2008\u201309 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Scandone Avellino | 10 || 10 || 34.2 || .408 || .360 || .683 || 5.0 || 2.7 || 1.1 || 0.3 || 16.2 || 13.8 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Career | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 44 || 41 || 30.6 || .445 || .400 || .750 || 4.6 || 1.6 || 1.2 || 0.3 || 14.1 || 13.1 ===EuroCup=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2009\u201310 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Scandone Avellino | 14 || 12 || 25.8 || .425 || .296 || .765 || 2.9 || 1.6 || 1.2 || 0.1 || 9.4 || 9.4 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2011\u201312 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cedevita Zagreb | 4 || 4 || 30.0 || .359 || .231 || .714 || 4.0 || 1.8 || 0.8 || 0.3 || 10.3 || 9.3 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Career | style=\"text- align:left;\"| | 18 || 16 || 26.7 || .447 || .284 || .750 || 3.1 || 1.6 || 1.1 || 0.2 || 9.6 || 9.3 ==References== ==External links== *The Story of Chris Warren *South Carolina Gamecocks bio *Euroleague.net profile *Eurobasket.com profile *FIBA.com profile Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:ABA League players Category:American expatriate basketball people in Argentina Category:American expatriate basketball people in Chile Category:American expatriate basketball people in Croatia Category:American expatriate basketball people in Israel Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Mexico Category:American expatriate basketball people in North Macedonia Category:American expatriate basketball people in Portugal Category:American expatriate basketball people in Serbia Category:American expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Texas Category:Bilbao Basket players Category:Bnei Hertzeliya basketball players Category:Junior college men's basketball players in the United States Category:KK Cedevita players Category:KK Cibona players Category:KK FMP (1991\u20132011) players Category:KK Zabok players Category:Liga ACB players Category:Obras Sanitarias basketball players Category:Panamanian expatriate basketball people in Serbia Category:Panamanian men's basketball players Category:Panteras de Aguascalientes players Category:People from Garland, Texas Category:S.S.
