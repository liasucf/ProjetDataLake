Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir also radiates agreeably offbeat charm as Sj\u00f6fn, even if her hangdog angel character that aches for pity would be more at home in a country and western song than in contemporary Iceland. ... A lightweight portrait of a potentially heavy subject, K\u00e1ri\u2019s fourth feature is an effortlessly likeable addition to his body of work, but too sweet and gentle to leave much of a lasting impression.\" ==References== ==External links== * *Virgin Mountain on kinocritics.com Category:Films about bipolar disorder Category:2015 drama films Category:2015 films Category:Films directed by Dagur K\u00e1ri Category:Icelandic drama films Category:Icelandic films Category:Icelandic- language films ",
