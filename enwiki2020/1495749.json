    "text": "Wolf Vladimir Vishniac (April 22, 1922 - December 10, 1973) was an American microbiologist. He was the son of photographer Roman Vishniac. Educated at Brooklyn College and Stanford University, he was a professor of biology at the University of Rochester. He died on a research trip to the Antarctic attempting to retrieve equipment in a crevasse. The crater Vishniac on Mars is named in his honor. Wolf Vishniac contributed greatly to the search for life on Mars by developing a special miniature laboratory that could be transported to that planet, known as the \"Wolf Trap\". This research was supported by a NASA grant started in 1959, the very first ever for the \"biological sciences.\" == Wolf Vishniac Memorial Award == A Wolf Vishniac Memorial Award for Young Researchers is awarded at the biennially held International Symposium On Environmental Biogeochemistry (ISEB).Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: \u201cInternational Symposia On Environmental Biogeochemistry (ISEB).\u201d Without date (2000/2001 ?).
