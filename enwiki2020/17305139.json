It was set up by the Progressive Ladies\u0092 Association and is housed in a three-storey 19th-century traditional town-house in the Doltso district, which belongs to the municipality of Kastoria. The purpose of the museum is to highlight cultural heritage, to perpetuate folk culture, and to illustrate Kastorian hospitality. On the first floor are the everyday room and the summer bedroom and on the second floor the main sitting room and the winter bedroom. They display a rich collection of women\u0092s and men\u0092s clothing (mainly formal local costumes), underwear, needlework and embroidery, handwoven textiles, and a rich collection of family photographs and women\u0092s portraits from Kastorian communities abroad. All the exhibits date to the 19th and early 20th centuries. On the ground floor there is quite a rich collection of domestic utensils.
