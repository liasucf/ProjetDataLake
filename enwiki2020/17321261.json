Scott Dibble and Rep. Susan Allen, both Minneapolis Democrats. After the Minnesota House voted on May 21, 2011, to place a gay marriage amendment referendum on the ballot in the 2012 general election, she and Dibble released a joint statement condemning the referendum. The referendum had voters decide whether a legal marriage was defined as between one man and one woman.http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/122426949.html Following the May 2011 House vote on the gay marriage amendment referendum, Clark stated: \"It\u2019s a sad day for the State of Minnesota. Tonight, we\u2019ve moved one step closer to discriminating against Minnesotans simply based on who they love. This amendment won\u2019t help a single family in Minnesota, and this vote is absolutely heartbreaking to thousands of people and families across our state. History will not look back kindly on this day or the people who voted for discrimination. The Minnesota I know is a place of inclusion, tolerance and love, and I truly believe the people of this great state will not vote to enshrine discrimination in our constitution...\" In 2013, after voters voted against the amendment, Clark was the House sponsor of an effort to legalize same-sex marriage. The act passed the House 75-59, as well as the Senate, and was later signed into law by Governor Mark Dayton. It took effect on July 1, 2013. (See also Same-sex marriage in Minnesota.) In 1993, Clark played a critical role alongside Senator Allan Spear in passing an amendment to the Minnesota Human Rights Act that banned LGBT discrimination in housing, employment, and education.Preston, Joshua. \"Allan Spear and the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\" Minnesota History 65 (2016): 76-87. === Environmental Advocacy === Clark has been in vocal in supporting protesters at Standing Rock who were part of the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests.
