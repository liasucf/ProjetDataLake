Her keel was laid 3 December 1941, and she was launched 25 April 1942. She was commissioned on 8 November 1942 in the United States Coast Guard as the United States Coast Guard Cutter Clover. She was built as a WAGL, redesignated a WLB in 1965, and again redesignated a WMEC in 1979. ==Ship's history== ===World War Two=== During the months of January and February 1943 Clover was used to break ice at Cleveland Ledge, Massachusetts and the Hog Island Channel in Chespeake Bay. Then Clover was assigned to the 13th Coast Guard District, Seattle, Washington; and used for escort duty due to the shortage of ships of that type. From April 1943 through September 1943 Clover was employed in the construction of the Bering Sea LORAN chain at St. Paul Island, Unimak Island, St. Matthew Island, and Cape Sarichef, Alaska. On 20 December 1943, the cutter towed the damaged U.S. Navy submarine chaser USS Maynard PC-780 to safety. In July 1945 Clover assisted the distressed U.S. Navy rescue tug USS ATR-(TP)-127. From 1944 to 1945 Clover was assigned to ALASKASEAFRON and performed general aids to navigation (ATON) duties. ===Postwar=== From 22 August 1946 through 17 October 1948 Clover was stationed at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and performed ATON duties.

From 1 July 1964 through 30 June 1965 Clover was stationed at Ketchikan, Alaska, and performed ATON duties. Then Clover was re-assigned to Sitka, Alaska and homeported there from 1 July 1965 through December 1969. As she had in previous assignments, her primary duty was the maintaining of aids to navigation (ATON). In April 1966 Clover took over the tow the disabled FV Astronaut from the Soviet FV Churkin 200 miles northwest of Ketchikan, Alaska. On 27 November 1967 the crew performed a MEDEVAC of a crewman from the Japanese MV Kirishima Maru in Sitka Sound, Alaska.

During March and April 1983 she assisted in the attempted salvage of Blunts Reef Large Navigational Buoy offshore from Cape Mendocino Light Station, California. In August 1983 Clover conducted fisheries patrol off the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts. On 1 June 1990 Clover was decommissioned and salvaged and turned over to the U.S. Navy.
