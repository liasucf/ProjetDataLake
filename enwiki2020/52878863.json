The partner was bought out during the first few years of the business.Bertman Ballpark Mustard - Official Site - About Us Bertman expanded his sales territory from Cleveland to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The mustard branded by one of his former employees, Stadium Authentic Mustard, is sold in retail stores, supermarkets, and online, and served in over 150 stadiums and arenas throughout the United States, but not in most Cleveland sports stadiums, where the competing Bertman's Original brand continues to be sold. ==Cleveland's mustard controversy== In 1966, Cleveland had one local brown mustard: Joe Bertman's. David Dwoskin, one of Bertman's sales reps, represented the Bertman brand to retailers throughout Ohio. In 1969, The Davis Food Company partnered with Joe to make \"The Authentic Stadium Mustard\" available for retail sales in supermarkets. In 1971, Dwoskin registered the name \"The Authentic Stadium Mustard\" for his new company Davis Food Company. In 1982, Davis Food Company obtained exclusive rights to sell to both wholesale and retail markets as well as stadiums, arenas and other venues. In the early 1980s there was a disagreement between Bertman and Dwoskin. Dwoskin produced his own mustard under the Stadium brand through his own company. The Bertman Family continues to sell its version of the mustard through its Bertman Foods Company.http://www.trademarkia.com/the-authentic- stadium-mustard-77564458.html Dwoskin told Cleveland.com that his mustard is served in 150 stadiums in the United States.
