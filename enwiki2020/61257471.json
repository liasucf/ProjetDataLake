    "text": "The Sadiqabad Railway Accident occurred on 11 July 2019 after the Quetta-bound Akbar Express collided with a cargo rake at the Walhar Railway Station (parked at the loop line), due to improper handling of the track switching mechanism. The accident took place around 4:30 am (Pakistan Standard Time), about south of the district headquarters of Rahim Yar Khan and the train engines were completely destroyed. Relief operations were launched immediately and a medical emergency was declared at nearby hospitals. An inquiry has been ordered and proportionate compensation for the victims were announced by the railway ministry. Whilst the unaffected coaches of the train left for its destination, regular traffic along the stretch of ML1 route was since suspended. President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and other political leaders have offered their condolences; the opposition noted such accidents to be a recurring event in the recent past and sought for the resignation of the incumbent Rail Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad. The death toll was listed as being 24 people, all of whom were on the passenger train. ==References== Category:Train collisions in Pakistan Category:2019 disasters in Pakistan Category:Railway accidents in 2019 ",
