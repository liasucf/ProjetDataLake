    "text": "The South Side German Historic District is a neighborhood within Quincy, Illinois, United States just south of downtown. The neighborhood includes most of Quincy's rich German architecture. The region is also widely known as \"Calftown\", named for the number of calves once owned by its inhabitants.http://www.illinoisbeautiful.com/western-illinois- tourism/159-german-historic-district-quincy-illinois.html It was added into the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 with a boundary increase in 1995. ==Notable Structures and Attractions== === Dick Brothers Brewery Building === 9th and York Street In 1857, three brothers; Matthew, John, and Jacob, founded the Dick Brothers Brewery. At one time, 70,000 barrels of brew would be produced and shipped around the Midwest, making Dick Bros. one of the largest beer brands in the country of the early 20th Century. The company's operations were once even larger than Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis.http://www.seequincy.com/DickBrosBrewery.html# Prohibition and World War II brought much hardship to the brewery, and the brand declared bankruptcy in 1951. The property was also auctioned off. Today, the building remains as a regional landmark and numerous renovation projects have been started to revitalize the building, including the introduction of a fine art studio.http://www.connecttristates.com/news/story.aspx?id=738187#.UhOqGpKsiSo There have even been projects attempting to revive the Dick Brothers brand.https://www.facebook.com/DickBrothersBrewingProject === Dr. Richard Eells House === 415 Jersey Street In 1835, Dr. Richard Eells built the aforementioned home, which now resides in both the Downtown Quincy Historic District and the South Side German Historic District. Eells was an outspoken abolitionist in his community, offering runaway slaves shelter on their way north. He was found guilty of harboring fugitive slaves in 1842, and his trial was heard by Judge Stephen A. Douglas, of the Lincoln-Douglas debate fame. Following his arrest and trial, he became President of the Illinois Anti- Slavery Party and unsuccessfully ran for the Liberty Party's nomination in the 1844 US presidential election. Today, the home of Dr. Richard Eells has been restored and is maintained by the local organization Friends of Dr. Richard Eells House. They provide tours of the historic house on an appointment basis.http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/il3.htm === Eighth Street Business District === 8th and State The Eighth Street Business District (pictured) forms the heart of the South Side German Historic District, and many notable features are along or nearby this interchange including the State Room, LaGondola's Spaghetti House, Gem City College, and the Salem Church. === Gem City College === 700 State Gem City College is a school that specializes in horology and cosmetology.http://www.gemcitycollege.com/index.php === LaGondola's Spaghetti House === === Quincy Public Library === 526 Jersey Street The Quincy Library serves much of the area's literature needs.
