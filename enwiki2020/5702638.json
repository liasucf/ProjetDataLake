    "text": "Toora wind farm is a wind power station at Toora in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. It is located north of Wilsons Promontory and 150 km SE of Melbourne. The wind farm is on a ridge overlooking the town of Toora. Toora has 12 wind turbines, each of 1.75 MW rated capacity, with a total generating capacity of 21 MW of electricity. The power station was completed in 2002. As of May 2008, it was owned by Transfield Services Infrastructure Fund. Danish company Vestas Wind Systems, one of the world's largest turbine manufacturers, constructed the wind farm. Transfield Services Infrastructure Fund became RATCH-Australia on 11 July 2011. Viewing and photography points are available on a road that passes the wind farm. From some of these views of the coastal plain, the Strzelecki Ranges, and Wilsons Promontory can be combined with views of the turbines. Accommodation is available in a caravan park at Toora. One of Toora's turbines can power up to 6,600 homes. ==References== * Wind Farms in Victoria Overview of the wind farm Category:Wind farms in Victoria (Australia) ",
