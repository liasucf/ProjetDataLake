Cheng was given the Japanese nickname \"Yumiko\" by her friends in secondary school, and upon signing with EEG, adopted it as her official stagename.Tran, Jenny. Yumiko Cheng Q&A; . 5 February 2007. Retrieved 22 July 2007. ==Career== Cheng was originally marketed as a member of the group 3T (along with Mandy Chiang and Maggie Lau), which released an EP in 2002. She was the sole member of the group who went on to release a solo EP later that year. This was followed by a second EP, DanceDanceDance () and her first full-length album One2Three, in 2003. In 2004, she released the album, Perfect Date, though made a decreasing number of media appearances due to health problems and an overall strategy re- evaluation within her company. 2005 saw a return with the lead single 'Arabian Market' (), complemented by a novel image that featured her in traditional Arabic dress. She would continue covering Middle-Eastern pop hits in subsequent singles such as 'Lupine Girl' (, originally sung by Aneela Mirza) in 2006, and 'Five Centuries' (, OT: Bechom Shei In The Heart of Tel Aviv) in 2008, which became a minor hit in its own right in the Chinese dance charts, and was even mentioned in a report by a major Israeli newspaper.Arad, Boaz. Israeli hit tops China music charts. 10 February 2009. Retrieved 11 February 2009. Yumiko's Space, the 2005 album to which 'Arabian Market' () belonged, otherwise showed an 80s disco and electronic influence. Veteran music producer Carl Wong () took on songwriting and production credits for 6 songs, including that of the second single 'Think' (). Electronic pop duo PixelToy also contributed one song, who again appear with songwriting credits on Cheng's 2008 Mandarin album Spectacular Era (). Cheng has interviewed in the past that Yumiko's Space remained a personal favourite of all her albums. Aside from a career in pop music, Cheng has starred in several films, including a special guest appearance in Stanley Kwan's 2005 feature, Everlasting Regret. In August 2015, Cheng left Emperor Entertainment Group after 15 years, and has since focused on acting for mainland television dramas as well as developing her clothing label, \"Why So Cool\". ==Wardrobe walfunctions== Cheng dominated the entertainment headlines in December 2006, due to a wardrobe mishap while performing an aerialist stunt for TVB's annual charity show. While being retrieved from mid-air on a trapeze, her trousers were accidentally pulled off by her stunt partner Chin Kar-lok, revealing her underwear. Much to Cheng's embarrassment, the incident garnered a great deal of media attention. The MC Eric Tsang later apologised due to public disapproval over a number of remarks made at the time of the incident, including a request for a replay of the accident in slow motion, though other MCs such as Nancy Sit and Lydia Shum were seen to have laughed uncontrollably in the television broadcast. She again made news on 23 June 2007 while performing as a featured guest for New Talent Singing Awards Toronto Audition, where she exposed part of her bare chest. The material was cut from the delayed broadcast in Vancouver. When pressed by Stephen Chen in a 2008 TVB interview to comment on whether or not these incidents were staged, Cheng's manager, Mani Fok remarks: \"Every woman has a bottom line.\"Youtube: \u970d\u6c76\u5e0c: \u5fd7\u96f2\u98ef\u5c40. ==Discography== 'As 3T' *2002: Girl Butterfly \u5c11\u5973\u8776 Solo Albums: *26 November 2002: Yumiko The Debut EP *6 June 2003: Dance Dance Dance (\u821e\u821e\u821e) EP *14 November 2003: One 2 Three *20 August 2004: Perfect Date *21 June 2005: Yumiko's Space *13 April 2006: Passion *10 November 2006: 7 Nutrients (Yumiko New + Best Selection) (\u4e03\u9023\u6ecb\u990a) *21 March 2007: Shanghai Doll (\u4e0a\u6d77\u5a03\u5a03) *2 February 2008: Super Model *20 November 2008: Wonderful Time (\u7cbe\u5f69\u5e74\u4ee3) *25 September 2014: I'm A Lucky Girl (New + Best Selection) ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
