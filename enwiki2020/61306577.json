Kigilyakh or kisiliyakhVerkhoyansk & Kisilyakh (; , meaning \"stone person\") are tall, pillar-like natural rock formations looking like tall monoliths standing more or less isolated. Usually they are composed of granite or sandstone shaped as a result of cryogenic weathering. Most kigilyakhs formed during the Cretaceous period and are about 120 million years old. ==Cultural significance== These anthropomorphic rock pillars are an important feature in Yakut culture.Kigilyakhi of the New Siberian Islands - Russian Geographical SocietyKigilyakhi of Yakutia Often they are slightly scattered, protruding from the surface of smooth mountains and giving the impression of a standing crowd of people. According to Yakut legends kigilyakhs originated in very ancient people. The Yakut word \"kisiliy\" means \"a place where there are people\".Types of weathering Kisilyakh means \"mountain having a man\" or \"mountain married\".\u041b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0448\u0430\u0444\u0442\u044b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u042f\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0438 (Landscapes as a Reflection of the Toponyms of Yakutia) The term \"kigilyakh\" is a distorted form of the original Yakut \"kisilyakh\".Toponimy of Regional Cultural Landscapes \u2013 Verkhoyansk District, Sakha (Yakutia) ==Locations== Such stones are found in different places of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia, mainly in the East Siberian Lowland: *Alazeya Plateau *Anabar Plateau *Kigilyakh Peninsula, with Mount Kigilyakh and Cape Kigilyakh, Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, New Siberian Islands *Kisilyakh Range, part of the Chersky Range *Kisilyakh-Tas, an isolated mountain located in the Kolyma Lowland, roughly from the coast of the East Siberian Sea, on the right bank of the Alazeya River at .\u0421\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u044e\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 (Andryushkino village and its inhabitants) *Kyun-Tas *Chetiryokhstolbovoy Island, Medvezhyi Islands, East Siberian Sea *New Siberian Islands *Oymyakon Highland *Polousny Range *Stolbovoy Island, Laptev Sea *Suor Uyata range\u041a\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u043e\u0440-\u0423\u0439\u044f\u0442\u0430 *Ulakhan SisYkt - \u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0423\u043b\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0438\u0441 Outside of Yakutia, similar formations are found in the island of Popova-Chukchina and the Putorana Plateau, in Krasnoyarsk Krai.A. Grigoriev, Megaliths in the Arctic ==History== Ferdinand Wrangel reported on the kigilyakhs on Chetyryokhstolbovoy, an island of the Medvezhyi Islands in the East Siberian Sea. He visited the island during his 1821-1823 expedition and named it after them (Chetyryokhstolbovoy meaning \"four pillars\"). The kigilyakhs on Chetyryokhstolbovoy Island are about high. In Soviet times on the Kigilyakh Peninsula at the western end of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, one of the New Siberian Islands, Vladimir Voronin, then in charge of the Polar station on the island, was shown a large standing rock which had been heavily eroded and which gave name to the peninsula.Soviets gather geographic data in Arctic - CIA ==Further reading== *Vladimir Gorbatovsky, \u0421\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 (Sacred places of Russia) *R.
