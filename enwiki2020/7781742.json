His displays during his time at Juventus led him to be nicknamed Il Guerriero (\"The Warrior\"), Rey Arturo (\"King Arthur\") and La Piranha by the Italian press due to his hard-tackling and aggressive, tenacious style of play. In Chile, he is also known as Kinnikuman, due to his looking similarity to the anime character in the same anime series.https://lalegal.cl/noticia/7600 Vidal started his career with Colo- Colo, where he won three Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n titles. He relocated to Europe, where he joined Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen and played there for four seasons. He then moved to Juventus in 2011, where he became widely recognized as one of the best midfielders in world football. At Juventus, he won the Scudetti in all four of his seasons and also was integral for them in reaching the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. Vidal was named to the ten-man shortlist for the 2015 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award following his performances. On 28 July 2015, Vidal returned to the Bundesliga, joining Bayern Munich and won three consecutive Bundesliga titles. After three years at Munich, he signed for La Liga giants Barcelona, where he won his eighth straight league title. Vidal has earned 117 caps for the Chile national team since his debut in 2007, playing in the 2011, 2015 and 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments, as well as the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, helping his nation to Copa Am\u00e9rica victory in 2015 and 2016. == Early life == Vidal was born in San Joaqu\u00edn, a working class commune in the Chilean capital Santiago. His talent was noticed by his uncle, and he later joined the youth squads of local Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Colo-Colo. == Club career == === Colo-Colo === Vidal's professional debut came in the first leg of the 2006 Torneo Apertura final against arch-rivals Universidad de Chile. Vidal came on as a late substitute for Gonzalo Fierro. Colo-Colo would go on to win the game 2\u20131 and win the championship as well. In the following season (Torneo Clausura) he became a more important part of the squad and would lead Colo-Colo to their second championship win in a row. Vidal scored three goals in Colo-Colo's Copa Sudamericana 2006 campaign. His good showing caught the eye of scouts from various European clubs. === Bayer Leverkusen === The 2007 Apertura Tournament was Vidal's last with Colo-Colo as he left for Bayer Leverkusen in the summer. Bayer had tracked his progress for some time and his good showing at the U-20 World Cup that year convinced Bayer Leverkusen director of football Rudi V\u00f6ller to make the trip to Chile to convince the 20-year-old to sign. The two clubs then agreed on a fee of US$11 million with Bayer Leverkusen, paying $7.7 million for 70% ownership of his contract. His transfer broke the previous national record of Mat\u00edas Fern\u00e1ndez's $9 million transfer to Villarreal. Vidal missed the first game of the season through injury but was soon thrust into the starting line-up and made his debut on 19 August 2007 in the away loss against Hamburger SV. He started in half the season's games and scored his first goal for the club just three games into his Bayer career. He was ever present for the 2008\u201309 season and played a vital role in Bayer's run to the DFB-Pokal final. On 8 March, he suffered a concussion during the game against VfL Bochum and was out for a month. Upon his return, he scored a goal to break the deadlock in the 4\u20131 semifinal win over Mainz 05 in the DFB-Pokal, but Bayer eventually lost to Werder Bremen in the final. The 2010\u201311 season would be Vidal's last with Bayer. He helped the club to a runner-up finish in the Bundesliga and topped the assist charts for his club with 11 assists, which was joint second in the league. He also contributed two goals in the club's run to the round of 16 of the UEFA Europa League. === Juventus === ==== 2011\u201312 season ==== After a good 2010\u201311 season, Vidal was linked with various clubs, including Bayer's Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich.
