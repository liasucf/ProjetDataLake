Rodi himself is openly gay. The Chicago settings of his books also reflect his background. Rodi's short fiction is collected in a number of anthologies, including Men on Men 5 and Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Book of Dreams. His comic book work has appeared in Marvel Comics, the DC Comics imprint Vertigo, and other independent publishers. He was also well known in comic book circles during the '60s and '70s as a prolific writer of \"letters to the editor\" (as Bob Rodi). Rodi was a founding member of the Chicago-area performance group The Pansy Kings and contributed plays and performed at the Live Bait Theatre. The film adaptation of his novel Kept Boy was released in 2017.Kept Boy at imdb.com == Bibliography == === Novels === * Fag Hag (1991) * What They Did to Princess Paragon (1994) * Closet Case (1994) * Drag Queen (1995) * Kept Boy (1996) * The Birdcage \u2014 novelization of the film (1996) * Bitch Goddess (2002) * When You Were Me (2007) * The Sugarman Bootlegs (2011) * Baby (2012) * Edgar and Emma : A Novel after Jane Austen (2016) === Nonfiction === * Dogged Pursuit: My Year of Competing Dusty, the World's Least Likely Agility Dog (2009) * Seven Seasons in Siena: My Quixotic Quest for Acceptance Among Tuscany's Proudest People (2011) * Bitch In a Bonnet: Reclaiming Jane Austen from the Stiffs, the Snobs, the Simps and the Saps (Volumes 1&2) (2012) === Comics === * \"Genes and a T-Shirt,\" in Heartthrobs #1 (with Phil Jimenez, Vertigo, January 1999) * \"Immune,\" in Strange Adventures #1 (with Frank Quitely, Vertigo, November 1999) * Four Horsemen (with Esad Ribic, 4-issue limited series, Vertigo, 2000) * \"You've Got Hate Mail\" (with Marcelo Frusin, in Flinch #8, Vertigo, January 2000) * \"The Spoils of War\" (with Frank Teran, in Weird War Tales Special #1, Vertigo, April 2000) * Codename: Knockout #1\u201324 (with Louis Small, Jr., Vertigo, 2001\u20132003, tpb, May 2010, ) * Elektra #23-35 (Marvel Comics, 2003\u201304) * The Crossovers #1\u20139 (with Mauricet, CGE/Code6, February\u2013December 2003) * Identity Disc (with John Higgins, 5-issue limited series, Marvel Comics, August\u2013December 2004, tpb, ) * Rogue #1\u20136 (with Cliff Richards, Marvel Comics, 2004, tpb, March 2005, ) * Loki (with Esad Ribic, 4-issue limited series, Marvel Comics, 2004, hardcover, February 2005, , softcover, October 2007, ) * Astonishing Thor (with Mike Choi, 5-issue mini-series, Marvel Comics, 2011) * Thor: For Asgard (with Simone Bianchi, 6-issue mini-series, Marvel Comics, 2011) * Thor: The Deviants Saga (with Stephen Segovia, 5 issues, Marvel Comics, 2012) * Merry Men (with Jackie Lewis (artist), Marissa Louise (colorist), Shari Chankhamma (colorist), and Jon Cairns (letterer), 5-issue mini-series, Oni Press, 2018) ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * *Facebook Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American humorists Category:American male novelists Category:Comics critics Category:Gay actors Category:Gay writers Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:LGBT comics creators Category:Writers from Chicago Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:LGBT novelists Category:LGBT people from Illinois Category:20th- century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:Novelists from Illinois ",
