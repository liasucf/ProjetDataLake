It\u2019s such a complex world and very opaque. If you\u2019re in it every day, it becomes second nature . . . When people come in, they often leave quickly because they feel threatened, make mistakes, or they\u2019re taken advantage of. So I\u2019m trying to help people understand . . . and enjoy it.\u201d == Family == Schiff has a son, who is of half-Danish descent. == Affiliations == * on the Artemis Council of the New Museum in New York * on the Board of Trustees of the Swiss Institute Contemporary Art New York * founding board member of LA> * co- founded VIA Art Fund * on the Board of Trustees of the Bronx Museum of Art * Rhizome Council * Publishers Circle of Triple Canopy *on the DIA Council of Art == Publications == * 2003: Informed Consent: Information Production and Ideology, Scarecrow Press, == References == Category:Living people Category:American art curators Category:1969 births Category:University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Category:University of Miami alumni ",
