    "text": "Zhang Dinghuang (; 1895\u20131986), also known as Zhang Fengju () was born in Nanchang. He was an author, literary critic, and translator, and expert in antique manuscripts (\u53e4\u8ff9\u6587\u7269). Zhang was a supporting but key figure of the rich 20th c Chinese literary movements. He was a talented multi-linguist who studied in Japan and France, professor at Beijing U and Sino Franco U., also active in the literary scene. Post-WWII primary figure to recover collection of looted antique manuscripts for Taiwan's National Central Library (literary equivalent of antiques of the Palace Museum). == Career and early years -- \u65e9\u5e74 == When 15 years old, he enrolled in the Nanchang Army Survey Academy (\u5357\u660c\u9646\u519b\u6d4b\u7ed8\u5b66\u5802), following elder brother Zhang Dingfan, an officer in the \"Dare to Die\" regiment of the Xinhai Revolution. He then attended Kyoto Imperial University. Returning from Japan in 1921 he began his literary and teaching career of the 1920s and 1930s, and activity to develop vernacular Chinese literature. 1920s Beijing University Chinese Literature Dept. Zhang Fengju is 2nd from left He taught at Peking Women's College of Education, Peking University, L'Institute des Hautes Etudes Chinoises of the Sorbonne in the 30s, and the Sino-French University in Shanghai. He mastered Japanese, French, and English, which would serve him well decades later. In 1937 he married Zhang Huijun \u5f20\u8559\u541b. \u521b\u9020\u5b63\u520a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5377\u7b2c\u56db\u671f1924 [Creation Quarterly Volume I, Issue 4, 1924] Zhang authored and translated works in French, Japanese and English. Examples include \"Shelley\" and \"Baudelaire\". He worked closely with key figures who shaped the modern Chinese literature and education today. These included Guo Moruo, Cheng Fangwu, Zhang Ziping, Zheng Boqi \u90d1\u4f2f\u5947, Xu Zuzheng \u5f90\u7956\u6b63, Shen Yinmo, Lu Xun. All of them participated in the journals Creation Quarterly, Yusi, Contemporary Review, and New Youth. These provided forums for lively and heated discourse on the transition to the vernacular Chinese language; weeklies for short insights or responses, quarterlies for considered and developed ideas. The goal was to bring the written language closer to everyday speech and use subject matter from everyday life. The wiki on \"Tattler\" has a good summary on this. He published \"Mr. Lu Xun\" in the journal \u00ab\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bc4\u8bba\u00bb \"Contemporary Review\", January 1925, a comprehensive and important review of the author still quoted today. During the 1940s and 50s, he worked for the Education Ministry with a major lasting achievement.

In the 1940s he worked primarily for the Chinese Ministry of Educatin and National Central Library in the areas of antiquities, education and publications. A lasting achievement was to recover the works of the Rare Book Preservation Society (\u6587\u732e\u4fdd\u5b58\u540c\u5fd7\u4f1a) which were looted during World War 2. It began with the Yuyuan Road Conferences (\u611a\u56ed\u8def\u4f1a\u8bae) in 1945\u20131946 to identify the wartime booty that Japan took. Key members included Jiang Fucong, Ma Xulun, Zheng Zhenduo, and Zhang Fengju.

March 23, 1946, the Ministry appointed Zhang Fengju to the Chinese Occupation Mission in Japan as head of the 4th Section (Education and Culture). He left for Tokyo on April 1 and began discussions with the U.S. Command General Headquarters (GHQ) the next day. Because of his gift in languages and his participation in the original preservation effort he held substantive meetings with all parties without translators. In 2 months, over 135,000 volumes were retrieved. By the year's end they were back in the hands of the National Central Library where they form the core of the rare books collection today. Many other university and museum collections were also retrieved. After 1949 and with the excesses which followed the Chinese Civil War, his closest friends and associates from the early years were on the mainland. His closest recent associates were in Taiwan. He himself favored neither side and preferred non-violence. He didn't participate in any government activities after 1960 but kept in touch with a network of old friends in Taiwan and U.S. including Li Shu-hua \u674e\u4e66\u534e, Zhu Jiahua \u6731\u5bb6\u9a85, Gu Mengyu \u987e\u5b5f\u4f59, Y.

Summarizing, the diary begins on April 1. He goes to Tokyo as part of the Chinese Occupation Mission headed by General Zhu Shiming on April 1, 1946. He knew many of the Japanese experts from his days at Kyoto Imperial University. His direct personal meetings from April 2, 1946 quickly bear fruit. A major portion was located in the Ueno Imperial Library on April 8. On April 11, he requests an official directive from the U.S. Supreme Command for the return of the collections: File:Issue Order to Return Manuscripts. Ret-xIMG 0006.jpg . The looted collections from the Rare book Preservation Society were in the Chinese Mission in Tokyo by June, and shipped to Shanghai by December. There were other collections as well as donations from Japanese institutions. Two months later, this is his official June 5: report to the Education Ministry and the National Central Library . Partial quote: \"After 2 months of negotiations, we got 40 crates on June 1. Planned to ship 18,000 volumes (about 255,000 books) on General Zhu's trip. But the airplane was too small. Humble apologies. Beyond this first batch, I have required the Japanese to complete the detailed inventory list, the packaging and return all by the end of this month.
