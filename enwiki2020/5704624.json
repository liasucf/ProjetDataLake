    "text": "Kenneth J. Green (born July 23, 1958) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour, the Nationwide Tour and the PGA Tour Champions. Green has won eleven tournaments as a pro, including five PGA Tour events. He is also known for returning to competition after losing his right leg in a 2009 RV accident. ==Early years== Green was born in Danbury, Connecticut. He started playing golf at age 12 in Honduras, where his father, Martin \"Marty\" Green, was principal of the American school, and his only choices of sports were golf or soccer. He quit school at 16 to pursue his dream of becoming a professional tour player. ==College career== He later attended Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth, Florida for a year. He then accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Buster Bishop and coach John Darr's Florida Gators men's golf team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1977 to 1979. Green was a second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection in 1979. ==Professional career== Green turned pro in 1979 and joined the PGA Tour in 1980. He had five tournament victories on the PGA Tour; all five came in the mid to late 1980s. His first win came in 1985 at the Buick Open, and his last was at the Kmart Greater Greensboro Open in 1989. His best year in professional golf was 1988, when he won two events on the PGA Tour, as well as the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan. His best finish in a major was a seventh- place tie at the 1996 U.S. Open. Green also played on the U.S. team in the 1989 Ryder Cup. During his time in professional golf, Green has had a reputation for rebelliousness and a propensity to pull stunts. He has had over two dozen fines levied by the PGA Tour for his bad boy antics. Some of his antics included sneaking friends into The Masters in the trunk of his car, drinking beer on the course while playing with Arnold Palmer at the 1997 Masters, and hitting golf balls through narrow openings in sliding-glass doors. Other fines were for more mundane offenses like swearing on the course, criticizing officials, and signing autographs while playing. His personal problems\u2014divorces, gambling, clinical depression\u2014led to near financial ruin, and affected his playing time and the quality of his play. In his 40s, Green had difficulty maintaining his PGA Tour playing privileges and was forced to play some on the Nationwide Tour. He has sometimes played tournament rounds dressed in green from head to toe, shoes included. Green had 508 career starts on the PGA Tour, the last coming in 2006. He continues to compete in a limited number of Champions Tour events. ==Personal life== Green lives in West Palm Beach, Florida. He is the father of two sons, Ken Jr. and Hunter. He is an avid bowler who once rolled a 300 game. In 2003, Green was reported to have jumped into a canal in Palm Beach County, Florida to save his German Shepherd dog, Nip, from the jaws of an alligator. In June 2009, Green was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident when his motor home left the road. Green was in his recreational vehicle traveling on Interstate 20 near Meridian, Mississippi, when the right front tire blew, causing the vehicle to veer off the road and go down a deep embankment before hitting a tree. The accident killed the passengers: William Green, his brother; Jeanne Hodgin, his girlfriend; and his dog, Nip. Even though his lower right leg was amputated as a result of injuries suffered in the accident, Green vowed to return to competitive golf. Green's estranged son Hunter died of a drug overdose in Dallas, Texas on January 22, 2010. In June 2019, Green released a self- published autobiography titled \"Hunter of Hope: A Life Lived Inside, Outside and On the Ropes.\" In it, he revisits his life as a teen in Guatemala, where, because of his alcoholic father's negligence, he was suffered years of sexual abuse by his father's friends. The golf course was a refuge from this abuse. He explains one reason for the book: \"My plan has been simple: Use the adversity as my purpose and reason to live.\" ==Amateur wins== this list may be incomplete *1978 Azalea Invitational ==Professional wins (11)== ===PGA Tour wins (5)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Aug 18, 1985 |Buick Open |\u201320 (69-65-67-67=268) |4 strokes | Wayne Grady |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Aug 17, 1986 |The International |12 pts (8-4-7-12=12) |3 points | Bernhard Langer |- |align=center|3 |align=right|Sep 4, 1988 |Canadian Open |\u201313 (70-65-68-72=275) |1 stroke | Bill Glasson, Scott Verplank |- |align=center|4 |align=right|Sep 11, 1988 |Greater Milwaukee Open |\u201320 (70-69-61-68=268) |6 strokes | Mark Calcavecchia, Jim Gallagher Jr., Donnie Hammond, Dan Pohl |- |align=center|5 |align=right|Apr 23, 1989 |KMart Greater Greensboro Open |\u201311 (73-66-66-72=277) |2 strokes | John Huston |} PGA Tour playoff record (0\u20132) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent(s)!!Result |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|1 |1988 |KMart Greater Greensboro Open | Sandy Lyle |Lost to birdie on first extra hole |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|2 |1988 |Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic | Seve Ballesteros, David Frost, Greg Norman |Ballesteros won with birdie on first extra hole |} ===Japan Golf Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Nov 20, 1988 |Dunlop Phoenix Tournament |\u201315 (70-68-64-71=273) |2 strokes | Fred Couples |} ===Asia Golf Circuit wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runners-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Feb 25, 1990 |Hong Kong Open |\u20138 (66-67-72=205)* |4 strokes | Danny Mijovic, Brian Watts |} *Note: The 1990 Hong Kong Open was shortened to 54 holes due to rain. ===Other wins (4)=== *1985 Hassan II Golf Trophy, Connecticut Open *1987 Spalding Invitational *1992 Connecticut Open ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1982 !1983 !1984 !1985 !1986 !1987 !1988 !1989 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |44 |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T11 |- |align=left|U.S. Open |CUT |T26 |CUT |T60 |WD |T31 |T32 |T46 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T29 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T61 |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T26 |CUT |CUT |WD |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1990 !1991 !1992 !1993 !1994 !1995 !1996 !1997 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |CUT |T35 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |WD |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T7 |CUT |- |align=left|The Open Championship |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T49 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T16 |WD |WD |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} CUT = missed the half-way cut WD = withdrew \"T\" = tied ===Summary=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Tournament !!
