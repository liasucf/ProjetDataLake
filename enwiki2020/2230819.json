Born in Costa Rica to Nicaraguan parents in 1875, he worked as a secretary for the La Luz y Los Angeles Mining Company, an American company chartered in Delaware that owned the large gold mines around Siuna in eastern Nicaragua. In this capacity, he helped channel funds to the revolt against Liberal President Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya, who had incurred the anger of the United States by negotiating with Germany and Japan to resurrect the proposed Nicaragua Canal. D\u00edaz became Vice President of Nicaragua in 1910.History of Vicepresidency After he became president in 1911, D\u00edaz was forced to rely on U.S. Marines to put down a Liberal revolt, which resulted in a contingent of Marines remaining in Nicaragua for over a decade. In return, in 1914, he signed the Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty, which granted the United States exclusive rights to build an inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua. After his term as president ended, D\u00edaz briefly lived in the United States. However, he returned to the presidency in 1926, after a coup by General Emiliano Chamorro (following the withdrawal of the Marines) failed to win U.S. support. During his second term as president, another Liberal revolt occurred. The Liberal forces were on the verge of seizing Managua when the U.S. forced the warring parties to accept a power-sharing agreement, the Espino Negro accord. One Liberal commander, Augusto Sandino, rejected the agreement and waged a guerrilla war against the U.S. Marines, who remained in the country to prop up D\u00edaz's government and enforce the Espino Negro accord. In 1928, after elections supervised by the Marines, D\u00edaz was replaced as president by former Liberal General Jos\u00e9 Maria Moncada. Afterwards, he acquired control of several of Nicaragua's gold mines, which had been destroyed during raids by Sandino's forces. He unsuccessfully tried to restore mining operations for the La Luz Company, until they sold their holdings to the Nevada-based Tonopah Mining Company. In 1936, after Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda seized power, D\u00edaz took up permanent residency in the United States. He lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, primarily in New York City but also in Miami and New Orleans, before moving to Costa Rica, where he died in 1964. ==References== == External links == *Adolfo D\u00edaz papers, Tulane University/Latin American Library Category:1875 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Alajuela Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Nicaraguan expatriates in the United States Category:People of the Banana Wars Category:Vice Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Conservative Party (Nicaragua) politicians ",
