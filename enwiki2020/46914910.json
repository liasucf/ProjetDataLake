These were governed by chiefs known as caciques (who were male), who were advised by priests/healers known as bohiques. Caciques enjoyed the privilege of wearing golden pendants called guan\u00edn and sitting on wooden stools to be above the guests they received. Bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with gods. The Ta\u00edno had a matrilineal system of kinship, descent and inheritance. When a male heir was not present, the inheritance or succession would go to the oldest male child of the deceased's sister. The Ta\u00edno had avunculocal post-marital residence, meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle. He was more important in the lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies. Most Ta\u00edno lived in large circular buildings (bohios), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and palm leaves. These houses, built surrounding the central plaza, could hold 10\u201315 families each. The cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (caney) of similar construction, with wooden porches. Ta\u00edno home furnishings included cotton hammocks (hamaca), sleeping and sitting mats made of palms, wooden chairs (dujo or duho) with woven seats, platforms, and cradles for children.Rouse, p. 15. (incomplete ref) The Ta\u00edno played a ceremonial ball game called batey. Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team and used a solid rubber ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well.Alegr\u00eda, p. 348. (incomplete ref) The games were often played on courts in the village's center plaza and are believed to have been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms' boundaries.Rouse, p. 15 Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game. Taino spoke an Arawakan language and did not have writing. Some of the words used by them, such as barbacoa (\"barbecue\"), hamaca (\"hammock\"), kanoa (\"canoe\"), tabaco (\"tobacco\"), yuca, batata (\"sweet potato\"), and jurac\u00e1n (\"hurricane\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English. ==Gallery== File:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|Cassava (yuca) roots, the Ta\u00ednos' main crop File:Duho.jpg|Dujo, a wooden chair crafted by Ta\u00ednos.
