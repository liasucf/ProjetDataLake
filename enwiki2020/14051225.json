    "text": "Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151czAndr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz (born August 27, 1959 in Budapest) is a Hungarian writer and poet. ==Life== Pet\u0151cz began his career in literary life in 1981. He was the chief editor for over two years of the art periodical Jelenl\u00e9t (Presence), \"The journal \"Presence\" started again in 1981 with Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz as chief editor.\" which was published by the Faculty of Humanities at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University of Sciences in Budapest, and soon became a significant forum on contemporary literature. \"The 80s are therefore eminently important in the literature of the recent past, for the changes that took place at that time laid the foundations for the literary life of our day. Very typically, one of the first such initiatives was taken at the University of Budapest, where some of us started a literary and art review, Jelenl\u00e9t (Presence). The political powers classified it as a student paper and as such they did not ban it; indeed, they could not have done so easily at a time when strikes were common in Poland. One of the first privately initiated periodicals, Jelenl\u00e9t presented the latest distinctive literary, artistic and, if only covertly, political endeavours. The period was far from being uneventful--we participated in the student movements demanding an autonomous student forum and independent teaching, and created the \"independent peace movement\" which, unlike the official peace movement, urged disarmament not only for the US but also for the Soviet Union.\" He graduated from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University of Sciences in 1986 where he studied Hungarian Literature and Language-History. After obtaining his degree he was an assistant at Gorkii State Library for a short time, and then worked as an editor for longer and shorter periods on literary magazines. Since then he has been working as a professional writer. Pet\u0151cz has taken part in several international literary and art festivals, e.g. in Paris (1986), in Tarascon (France, 1988), in Marseille (1995). He has been working as a university and college lecturer for seven years. ==Work== ===Poetry=== Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz: Letter \"A\" (concrete poem, 1989) Pet\u0151cz has published around 25 books, including poems for adults and children, essays, fiction and reviews. Pet\u0151cz poetry volumes include the book A tenger d\u00edcs\u00e9rete (1994, ), and the poetry collections Meduza (2000, ) and A naps\u00fct\u00f6tte s\u00e1vban (2001, ). He also published a \"collected poems book\" under the title Majdnem minden (Almost everything, 2002, ). He also edited several volumes of avant-garde literature and worked as organizer for a variety of events showcasing experimental literature. He also was the editor of \"Medium Art\", a Selection of Hungarian Experimental Poetry. \"Petocz has made an anthology for the Hungarian Experimental Poetry in 1990, the 'Medium Art'.\" In the eighties he was one of the \"leaders\" of Hungarian avant-garde poetry, \"Petocz was the leader of the New Wave of the Hungarian Avant-garde\" having begun to work on sound poetry during the period. \"Andras Petocz began to work with sound poetry in the 1980s, as one of the (then) young poets inspired by the more and more assiduous presence of Magyar Muhely in Hungary. Petocz's poetry essentially is based on the tradition of French phonetic poetry: the strong role of repetition is combined with a poetic language constructed of phonemes, syllables and relatively few words. He has been collaborating with the outstanding Hungarian composer, Laszlo Sary.\" His visual and concrete poetry is well known. B\u00e9la Vilcsek writes about his poetry: \"Legends and extremes accompany Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz on his home ground. He always has a dichotomy, either wanting to pay respects to classicism or to modernity, conservatism or avant-garde, sonnet or free verse, tradition or the new. In his mid-thirties, he already commands an authoritative reputation with his life-work, in both its quantity and quality. There are few writers like this among those in his field.\"B\u00e9la Vilcsek: Afterword (In: Andras Petocz: In Praise of the Sea, cover, 1999, )\" ===Prose=== The more than six prose books Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz has published contain essays and reviews such as Idegenk\u00e9nt, Eur\u00f3p\u00e1ban (As a Stranger in Europe, 1997, ), a series of short stories called Egykor volt h\u00e1zibar\u00e1taink (Once We Had House Friends, Chapters from a Family Saga, 2002, ), and two novels A sz\u00fclet\u00e9snap (The Birthday, 2006, ) and Idegenek (Strangers, 2007, ). ====The Birthday==== The Birthday is a novel that tells a family story spanning 30 years. Tony the little boy narrator is special in that he does not get older. He remains a child as he looks at events around him. Everyone is preparing for the birthday of the head of the family while they look at the Big Photo Album. The 30 years of the novel brings to life what happened from the early sixties to the nineties, how people lived in Central Europe and refers to the change of system in Hungary in 1989. The little boy narrator, still waiting in vain for his father at the beginning of the celebrations, becomes a man due to his missing father and his memories. He tells the family stories \"in one breath\" using spoken expressions and personal remarks. K\u00e1roly D. Balla writes about A sz\u00fclet\u00e9snap: \u201cThe author, who is himself on the threshold of dreams, redeems historical and family tragedies with angelic good humour, and what might make an adult grumpy and ill is rendered tolerable by the imagination of childhood memories and the genuineness of the hope in them.\u201d ====Strangers==== In this novel, an eight- year-old girl learns to lie in order to survive. It is not clear exactly where and when Strangers takes place. Somewhere in Europe, or the edges of Europe, but it could be somewhere in America or Asia. Perhaps in the 20th century, but it could be the first decade of the 21st century. As the subtitle says, the story takes place \"thirty minutes before the war\". The little girl maintains human values even in a world of terror and oppression. Terrible things happen to small children on a daily basis. Across the border is the free world where there are no soldiers in charge, where you can travel freely. The free world might be reached through a rat infested tunnel. The novel deals with events that have already taken place in the 21st century and turns concrete events into fiction. It elaborates the terrorist atrocity of Beslan in Russia. Gy\u00f6rgy C. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n writes about Idegenek: \u201cIn the world of the novel \u2013 it is difficult to interpret Pet\u0151cz\u2019s work any other way \u2013 everyone is an outsider. As they are in the outside world (suggests the novel). For in this world (in the novel and outside) the fact of being an outsider means to be vulnerable to a deadly threat (or is itself a threat), it means oppression, helplessness and determined opposition. Being an outsider is not just about a different use of language (or using a different language), clothes, skin colour or customs, but is embodied primarily in oppression and power \u2013 wherever the outsider may be. To be more precise, the defenceless and those in power are both outsiders for each other, and no matter who is in either position, for everyone else too.\u201dGy\u00f6rgy C.

Kalman: Hepiend nincs? in: Elet es Irodalom, 2007, HU-ISSN 0424-8848 ==Prizes== Pet\u0151cz has received numerous literary prizes and awards for his work in literature, including the Lajos Kass\u00e1k Literary Prize in 1987, which he received for his experimental poetry from the distinguished avantgarde literary journal Magyar M\u0171hely (Hungarian Workshop). Pet\u0151cz's poem \"Eur\u00f3pa metafor\u00e1ja\" (Europe, metaphorically) won the Robert Graves Prize for best Hungarian poem of the year 1990. In 1996 Pet\u0151cz was awarded the Attila J\u00f3zsef Prize by the cultural part of the Hungarian government as an official recognition of his work to date. He is also a UNESCO-Aschberg Laureate, having been granted a bursary in 2006 for the residency program at CAMAC (Centre d\u2019Art. Marnay Art Centre) in Marnay-sur-Seine. to write a new novel. In 2008 he received the S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai Prize awarded by the Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture, for his novel Idegenek (Strangers). ==Participations== Andr\u00e1s Pet\u0151cz has been to numerous writers\u2019 residences and has been a guest at numerous international writers' meetings. He spent three months in the United States in 1998, where he took part in an international writers\u2019 seminar within the framework of the International Writing Program (IWP) in Iowa City. While there, he took part in events with about 25 writers from all over the world, including Israeli prose writer Igal Sarna and the brasilien writer Bernardo Carvalho.
