The flooding was most intense in the period from 24\u201325 August, when ten people were killed, a further five were declared missing and 1,400 households were flooded. Other counties significantly affected in late August were Mure\u015f, Prahova and Bistri\u0163a. The city of T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, an important regional centre, was also affected by the rising of waters on the T\u00e2rnava River, even though there wasn't a significant amount of damage caused to infrastructure.Juh\u00e1sz, Andr\u00e1s, Catastrophe near by the rivulet Feh\u00e9r-Nyik\u00f3 and Became a vale of tears, Weather Underground, wunderground.com, 2005-9-17.

In Cluj county, over 100 houses were flooded, with the flooding centred on the town of Turda. Railway lines in the county were also closed. The localities of Pope\u015fti, Suplacu de Barc\u0103u and Valea lui Mihai were affected in Bihor county. ===Central Europe and the Alpine region=== A stadium in Thun, Switzerland under water The Swiss capital of Bern was also heavily hit after the Aar burst its banks, and the town of Brienz saw 400 residents evacuated. The village of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Alps was completely cut off. The only exit from the town is by a very narrow gorge just wide enough to take the river, road and railway, and the river expanded to fill the entire gorge. This stranded thousands of tourists in the village, and the only way out was by helicopter or by crossing one of the high Alpine passes. The Tyrol and Vorarlberg states of Austria saw many areas cut off by flooded roads. The lower part of the Rhine overflowed, affecting the Swiss Graub\u00fcnden Canton, as well as parts of Vorarlberg. The river Danube and its tributaries overflowed in many places, flooding parts of Germany, Bavaria in particular. Several floodings and landslides were reported in Lower Austria and Styria. The floods also meant the temporary closure of many mountain passes, amongst them the Gotthard in Switzerland, and the Arlberg in Austria. On a section of the Arlberg, the road and rail were washed away. Austrian Federal Railways have issued a statement (in German) that the rail line reconstruction will take at least a month. The main phone and data line between Vorarlberg and the rest of Austria was destroyed and had to be replaced by a radio communication. With rain and flood waters subsiding on August 27, people started to return to their homes, rail and road routes reopened and the cleanup began. Town of Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107 in Serbia was devastated by floods. Poland, where seven bridges collapsed, and Slovenia were was also affected by flooding in August. ===Other countries=== Bulgaria and Moldova were also affected, though to a lesser extent. In Bulgaria, three months of rain and flooding killed 20 people and left 14,000 homeless. The country was hit by further floods in August (normally a very dry month), though these did not cause such widespread damage, but caused damage to the year's crops, causing an increase in the price of fruit and vegetables. Moldova was also hit by torrential rains in August. ==References== *24 August 2005. \"Floods cause havoc across Europe\" at BBC News.
