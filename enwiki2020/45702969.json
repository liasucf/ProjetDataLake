    "text": "Tower and treetop walkway The West Coast Treetop Walk is a canopy walkway through mature rimu forest near Hokitika on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The tourist attraction was built by Australian eco-tourism company 'Canopy01' in 2012 and comprises a long elevated steel walkway, viewing tower, and cantilever. The walkway leads through the canopy of mature native West Coast forest dominated by rimu at a height of around above ground. It passes close to the crowns of mature rimu trees and sits above smaller trees and tree ferns. The loop walk takes in views of the nearby Lake Mahinapua and includes a cantilever extending out into the forest canopy. A tall steel viewing tower, with a spiral staircase, has views over the surrounding forest and northern ranges of the Southern Alps including Toaroha Range, Diedrichs Range and Mt O'Connor. The tourist attraction is locally run via a 45-year concession lease from the Department of Conservation NZ and includes a car park and cafe, with the actual canopy walkway accessible via a 5-minute walk from the cafe. ==References== ==External links== *West Coast Treetop Walk & Cafe - Official web site Category:Tourist attractions in New Zealand Category:West Coast, New Zealand Category:Pedestrian bridges in New Zealand ",
