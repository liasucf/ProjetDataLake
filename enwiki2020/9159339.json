    "text": "Ganna Walska (born Hanna Puacz on June 26, 1887 \u2013 March 2, 1984) was a Polish opera singer and garden enthusiast who created the Lotusland botanical gardens at her mansion in Montecito, California. She was married six times, four times to wealthy husbands. The lavish promotion of her lackluster opera career by her fourth husband, Harold Fowler McCormick, inspired aspects of the screenplay for Citizen Kane. ==Biography== Ganna Walska was born Hanna Puacz on 26 June 1887 in Brest, Russian Empire, to Polish parents Napoleon Puacz and Karolina Massalska.Pinkowski Files \u2013 a database of American Polonia http://www.poles.org/db/w_names/Walska_G.html Ganna is a Russian form of Hannah, and Walska \"reminiscent of her favorite music, the waltz\".About Madame Walska http://www.lotusland.org/about-us/about-madame-walska Harold F. McCormick In 1922, after her marriage to Harold F. McCormick, Ganna Walska purchased the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. She told the Chicago Tribune that she had invested her own funds, not those of her wealthy husband, and said, \"I will never appear in my own theatre until I have gained recognition based solely on my merits as an artist.\"\"Walska Buys Theatre.\" The New York Times, December 15, 1922 Walska became a student of vocal teacher C\u00e9cile Gilly. Marjorie Lawrence, another student of Gilly's, stated that it was clear that Walska had little aptitude for music, but that Gilly took her on for the money. Marjorie Lawrence, Interrupted Melody (Sydney: Invincible Press, 1949), p. 64. Walska pursued a career as an opera singer. The lavish promotion of her opera career by McCormick\u2014despite her apparent reputation as a mediocre singer\u2014inspired aspects of the screenplay for Orson Welles's Citizen Kane.Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles. New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 page 49 Roger Ebert, in his DVD commentary on Citizen Kane, suggests that the character of Susan Alexander was based on Walska. McCormick spent thousands of dollars on voice lessons for her and even arranged for Walska to take the lead in a production of Zaz\u00e0 by Ruggero Leoncavallo at the Chicago Opera in 1920. Reportedly, Walska got into an argument with director Pietro Cimini during dress rehearsal and stormed out of the production before she appeared. Contemporaries said Walska had a terrible voice, pleasing only to McCormick. New York Times headlines of the day read, \"Ganna Walska Fails as Butterfly: Voice Deserts Her Again When She Essays Role of Puccini's Heroine\" (January 29, 1925), and \"Mme. Walska Clings to Ambition to Sing\" (July 14, 1927). \"According to her 1943 memoirs, Always Room at the Top, Walska had tried every sort of fashionable mumbo jumbo to conquer her nerves and salvage her voice,\" reported The New York Times in 1996. \"Nothing worked. During a performance of Giordano's Fedora in Havana she veered so persistently off key that the audience pelted her with rotten vegetables. It was an event that Orson Welles remembered when he began concocting the character of the newspaper publisher's second wife for Citizen Kane.\" In 1926 Walska purchased the Duchess of Marlborough Faberg\u00e9 egg that had been offered by Consuelo Vanderbilt at a charity auction. It was later acquired by Malcolm Forbes as the first Easter egg in his Faberg\u00e9 egg collection.Faberge \u2013 Treasures of Imperial Russia (retrieved January 16, 2012) Ganna Walska died on March 2, 1984, at Lotusland, leaving her garden and her fortune to the Ganna Walska Lotusland Foundation.Ganna Walska Lotusland Foundation ==Marriages== Ganna Walska was married six times: * Russian baron, Arcadie d'Eingorn, a Russian officer.

Due to restrictions on wartime visas, the monks were unable to come to the United States. After her divorce from Bernard in 1946, Walska changed the name of her estate to Lotusland (after a famous flower held sacred in Indian and Tibetan religions, the lotus, Nelumbo nucifera) and the lotus growing in several of her garden's ponds. She devoted the rest of her life to designing, redesigning, expanding, and maintaining the estate's renowned innovative and extensive gardens. Her landscape design talent is well regarded for distinctive gardens of exceptional creativity. ==Honors== * Gold Cross of Merit from the Polish government in 1931 * L\u00e9gion d'honneur order from the French government in 1934 * L'Ordre National des Arts et des Letters from the French government in 1972 ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * Ganna Walska Lotusland, Frommer's Review * Lotusland history * * About Citizen Kane (Humanities 140, \"Approaches to Film,\" Winona State University) \u2014 * Kiester, Edwin Jr., \"Not your average backyard gardener\" (abstract).
