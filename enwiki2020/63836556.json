As she has recalled: \"We had books at home but I wouldn\u2019t consider my parents as having been 'great readers'. I remember a long, low bookcase in the sitting room with the Encyclopedia Britannica gathering dust on the bottom shelf. The books were mainly non-fiction \u2014 illustrated tomes about art or classical Greece \u2014 and Readers' [sic] Digest. I don't remember my parents reading novels but I do remember some tut-tutting about the trial of Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover \u2014 a book that certainly wouldn't have been their bedtime reading.\" After attending school in London, Pattullo went on to study politics at the University of Edinburgh, where her concerns and thinking broadened to include class, race and feminism. ===Writing and activism=== She worked as a journalist for many years, predominantly as an editor on British magazines and newspapers, including The Observer and The Guardian.Polly Pattullo contributions to The Guardian.

In 1983 she wrote a pamphlet for the NCCL Rights for Women Unit, entitled Judging Women: A Study of Attitudes That Rule Our Legal System (illustrated by Ros Asquith), which, as described by the reviewer for The Observer, \"presents a battery of cases to illustrate ... the questionable relationship between the British judiciary and legal profession and the women with whom they deal \u2013 whether as complainants, defendants, victims of crime, or lawyers themselves.\"Watts, Janet, \"Without Prejudice\", The Observer, 29 January 1984, p. 51.

Reviewing the latter in the Times Higher Education, James Ferguson stated: \"Polly Pattullo's lucid account makes clear the Montserrat volcano affair cast unexpected light into one of the dustier recesses of British foreign policy....
