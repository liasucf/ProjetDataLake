    "text": "Cultus Bay is a bay in Island County, in the U.S. state of Washington. Cultus is a name derived from the Chinook Jargon meaning \"worthless\". The Cultus Bay Estuary has been diked off, minimising open tidal exchange. A tide-gate and a small culvert allow for a little salt water exchange. ==References== Category:Bays of Washington (state) Category:Bays of Island County, Washington ",
