    "text": "Medusavirus is a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus first isolated from a Japanese hot spring. It notably encodes all five types of histones \u2014 H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 \u2014 which are involved in DNA packaging in eukaryotes. The virus can harden amoebas of the species Acanthamoeba castellanii into stone-like cysts, but infection usually causes infected amoebas to burst open. The virus was named after Medusa, the monster in Greek mythology whose gaze turned people to stone. == References == Category:DNA viruses Category:Unaccepted virus taxa ",
