    "text": "Northern Ireland has competed in eighteen of the twenty Commonwealth Games beginning with the second games, held in 1934. Northern Ireland did not compete in 1930 (when there was a single team from Ireland) and in 1950. It differs from the Olympic Games where although it officially competes with England, Scotland and Wales as part of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, many athletes have represented the Ireland team. Northern Ireland's participation in the Commonwealth Games is managed by a body known as the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council. ==Medal tally== ===Medals by Games=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
