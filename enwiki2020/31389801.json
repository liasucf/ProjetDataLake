He earned his Bachelor's degree from the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Belgrade in the field of Automatic Control Systems in 1957. By 1963, he had received both his Master's and Ph.D. degrees under the supervision of Professor Dusan Mitrovic; and he was appointed Docent Professor in that same year. He accepted an invitation to become Visiting Professor in the School of Engineering at Santa Clara University in 1964, where he taught courses in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, and developed parameter space methods for design of control systems.SCU Biographical Data == Research == In 1964, \u0160iljak was awarded a multi-year grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to apply parameter space methods for the design of robust control systems to space structures. He collaborated with Sherman Selzer in the Astrionics Laboratory of NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center to design the navigation and control systems for the Saturn V Large Booster that propelled the 1969 Apollo 11 lunar mission. He then began to develop his theory of stability and control of large-scale systems, based on graph-theoretic methods and vector Lyapunov Functions. He applied the theory to the decentralized control of the Large Space Telescope and Skylab built by NASA. In the early 1970s, \u0160iljak considered large-scale dynamic systems composed of interconnected sub-systems with uncertain interconnections. He defined the concept of \"connective stability\": a system is considered stable when it remains stable despite the disconnection and re-connection of subsystems during operation. He established the methods for determining the conditions for connective stability within the framework of comparison principle and vector Lyapunov functions. He applied these methods to a wide variety of models, including large space structures, competitive equilibrium in multi-market systems, multi-species communities in population biology, and large scale power systems. In the 1980s, \u0160iljak and his collaborators developed a large number of new and highly original concepts and methods for the decentralized control of uncertain large-scale interconnected systems. He broadened new notions of overlapping sub-systems and decompositions to formulate the inclusion principle. The principle described the process of expansion and contraction of dynamic systems that serve the purpose of rewriting overlapping decompositions as disjoint, which, in turn, allows the standard methods for control design. Structurally fixed modes, multiple controllers for reliable stabilization, decentralized optimization, and hierarchical, epsilon, and overlapping decompositions laid the foundation for a powerful and efficient approach to a broad set of problems in control design of large complex systems. This development was reported in a comprehensive monograph Decentralized Control of Complex Systems In the following two decades, \u0160iljak and his collaborators raised the research on complex systems to a higher level. Decomposition schemes involving inputs and outputs were developed for and applied to complex systems of unprecedented dimensions. Dynamic graphs were defined in a linear space as one parameter groups of transformations of the graph space into itself. This new mathematical entity opened the possibility to include continuous Boolean networks in a theoretical study of gene regulation and modeling of large-scale organic structures. These new and exciting developments were published in Control of Complex Systems: Structural Constraints and Uncertainty. == Awards == In 1981,\u0160iljak served as a Distinguished Scholar of the Japan Society for Promotion of Science. In that same year he became a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), \"for contributions to the theory of nonlinear control and large-scale systems\". He was selected as a Distinguished Professor of the Fulbright Foundation in 1984, and in 1985 became an International Member of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1986, he served as a Director of the NSF Workshop \u201cChallenges to Control: A Collective View,\u201d organizing a forum of top control scientists at Santa Clara University for the purpose of assessing the state of the art of the field and outlining directions of research. In 1991, he gave a week-long seminar on decentralized control at the Seoul National University as a Hoam Distinguished Foreign Scholar. In 2001, he became a Life Fellow of the IEEE. In 2010 he received the Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award from the American Automatic Control Council, \"for his fundamental contributions to the theory of large-scale systems, decentralized control, and parametric approach to robust stability\".Santa Clara University Newsletter 2010/05/03 == Sports career == \u0160iljak was a member of the national water polo team of Yugoslavia that won the silver medal at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland. He was again a member of the team when it won the World Cup \u201cTrofeo Italia\u201d played in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 1953. \u0160iljak played water polo for the club \u201cJadran\u201c of Hercegnovi when the club won The National Championship of Yugoslavia in 1958 and 1959. He was a member of the club \u201cPartizan,\" Belgrade when the club won the Yugoslav Championship in 1963 and became the \u201cChampion of Champions\u201d by winning the Tournament of European Water Polo Champions in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1964. == Works == Books * Nonlinear Systems: The Parameter Analysis and Design (1969) * Large-Scale Dynamic Systems: Stability and Structure (1978) * Decentralized Control of Complex Systems (1991) *Control of Complex Systems: Structural Constraints and Uncertainty (2010, with A.
