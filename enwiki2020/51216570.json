    "text": "Thomas Baden Morris (30 April 1900 \u2013 22 January 1986) was an English writer from Godstone, Surrey who as T. B. Morris and as Yves Cabrol wrote a large number of plays, popular with amateur theatre groups. As a prolific playwright (over a hundred one-act plays written) he has been compared with Philip Johnson (playwright) and David Campton, and has been remarked on for his stylistic breadth and variety of subject matter and cast requirements.Colin Dolley and Rex Walford The One-Act Play Companion: A Guide to plays, playwrights and performance Published by A & C Black, London. His \"Yves Cabrol\" plays are comedies set in provincial France. Several of his plays were directed by Patricia Hackett for the University of Adelaide Theatre Guild in the 1940s: Renaissance Night, Gild the Mask Again and The Beautiful One. He died in Bristol in 1986. == References == == External links == * Doolee.com the playwrights' database:T. B.
