    "text": "Polaroid BC flash model 281 A battery\u2013capacitor flash (BC flash) is a flash photography system used with flashbulbs. Instead of relying directly on the current pulse ability of a battery to directly fire a flashbulb, a battery is used to charge a capacitor that is then discharged through the flashbulb. BC flash units use 5.6V, 15V, or 22\u00bdV batteries. ==Advantages== The advantage is that even with an aging battery, the flashbulb still gets a high current pulse and thus reliably fires, although the recycle time between flashes increases as the battery ages. ==See also== *Photoflash battery ==References== * Electronics for Photographers, by Marshall Lincoln, Copyright 1966 by Chilton Books, pp 43\u201354. * Capacitors & Batteries, Boston University Physics Department Category:Flash photography Category:Photographic lighting ",
