You must now make up your minds whether > to serve God or Belial. (Cheers.) . . . For myself I say distinctly -- No > more compromises. (Long continued applause.) I love the Constitution and the > Union, but I will not buy them from an enemy. (Cries of good.) . . . South > Carolina is not out of the Union, and by the blessing of Almighty God she > never will be out of the Union. (Uproarious cheers.) And if you believe as I > do, she never will be out of the Union. (Cheers.) The eighteen millions of > the North are not to be put down by the eight millions of the South. The > prospect is indeed gloomy. We have a traitor President and a corrupt and > rotten Cabinet. But with all the banded seceding States and their traitor > friends, we will yet save the Union. (Cheers.) . . . The South thinks the > North is craven, and our Union-saving merchants encourage that belief. I > want to know whether every man is going to purchase a peace or defend the > peace.
