    "text": "The Basic Law of Saudi Arabia (alternative name: Basic System of Governance; , ') is a constitution-like charter divided into nine chapters, consisting of 83 articles. The constitution of Saudi Arabia is \"the Holy Qur'an, and the Sunna (Traditions)\" of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (as stated in Article One of the Basic Law), but the Basic Law contains many characteristics of what might be called a constitution in other countries (\"The Law of Governance\", \"Rights and Duties\"). The Basic Law is in accordance with the Wahhabi understanding of Sharia and does not override Islamic laws. ==History== Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the First Gulf War, King Fahd issued a royal decree that was published in official television and newspapers on 31 January 1992.Saudi Arabia \u2013 Constitution The Decree stated the following: ::Royal Decree No. A/90 ::27/8/1412 AH ::By the Help of Allah, ::We, Fahd bin Abdul Aziz, the King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, consistent with the public interest, and in view with the development of the State in different fields, in addition to our enthusiasm to achieve our prospected objectives, we ordered the following: ::First: Issue the Basic System of Governance according to the context herein below. ::Second: Act in accordance with all the systems, orders, and resolutions that are currently adopted, until they are amended pursuant to the Basic System of Governance. ::Third: The Basic System of Governance shall be published in the official journal and shall be enforceable as of the date of its publication. The Consultative Council also came to life about a year after in the light of the emerging conditions affecting the country after the war. Saudi cultural and religious views stigmatize any reference to \"Constitution\" other than the Qur'an and the practice of Muhammad. Article 1 of the Basic Law emphasize that \"God's Book (Qur'an) and the Sunna of his Prophet (Muhammad), are its (Saudi Arabia) constitution\". Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz said that there cannot be \"a constitution, a regulation, or a law that runs counter to the Islamic Sharia\" in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Prince Talal bin Abd Al-'Aziz Explains the New Method of Determining Future Kings in Saudi Arabia 12 January 2007 ==Articles of the Basic Law of Governance== ===Chapter 1: General Principles=== Article 1 states that \"God's Book and the Sunna of His Prophet\" are the country's constitution and Arabic is the official language with the capital at Riyadh. ===Chapter 2: Monarchy=== Article 7 proclaims the rights of the monarch.

The government of Saudi Arabia reserves numerous jobs for the clergy that range from preaching to judgeships. Islamic clergy (ulema) such as muftis and sheikhs, who dominate Saudi Arabian legal positions, make use of the Basic Law in addition to the Qur'an, hadith, sunnah, and Islamic jurisprudence which all fall within Sharia. The Basic Law makes no mention of women; Amnesty International write in their 2000 report on Saudi Arabia: > Discussion of discrimination against women and their status as second class > citizens has for a long time been a taboo, untouchable even by the highest > of state authorities in the country despite all the misery and suffering of > women for no reason other than their having been born female. Saudi writer and journalist Wajeha Al-Huwaider writes that \"Saudi women are weak, no matter how high their status, even the 'pampered' ones among them \u2013 because they have no law to protect them from attack by anyone. The oppression of women and the effacement of their selfhood is a flaw affecting most homes in Saudi Arabia.\" ==See also== * Legal system of Saudi Arabia ==References== ==External links== *Basic Law of Saudi Arabia * English text of the Basic Law at the Saudi Embassy in Washington *King Fahd's Speech on the issuance of the Basic Law of Governance *The Basic Law *Saudi Arabia: Basic Law of Government *Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's legal system *Constitution, Government & Legislation of Saudi Arabia *The View from a Majlis Ash-Shura Member \u2013 A Conversation with Usamah al Kurdi The Saudi-US Relations Information Service Saudi Arabia, Basic Law of ",
