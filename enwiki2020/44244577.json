The daughter of academics Federico Schopf and Marta Caballero Santacruz, Paula and her family were exiled to Frankfurt Germany when she was three years old after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1973 and the political persecution that followed. Paula returned to Chile at the age of seven though her brothers and father stayed in Germany. Despite this, she maintained contact with the rest of her family, especially her older brother, who used to mail her electronic music cassette tapes. The tapes sent by her brother were part of Paula's formative musical influences. Her brother introduced her to some of the electronic music that would strongly influence her and she was turned on to the genre by acts such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, Chris & Cosey and Cabaret Voltaire.LOVE CiTY CENTRAL BIO lovecity- central.com retrieved on 24 October 2014 Other influences came from the classical and psychedelic music that she heard at home. \"I have always listened to classical music. My stepfather was a German hippie and I got to know a lot of psychedelic music from his old records. Not like \"The Doors\", more cutting edge, more underground: Soft MachineChica Paula at Musica Popular (ES) \"Siempre escuch\u00e9 un mont\u00f3n de m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica. Viv\u00ed con mi padrastro, que es un hippy alem\u00e1n, y conoc\u00ed mucha m\u00fasica psicod\u00e9lica de discos antiguos. No como los Doors, sino m\u00e1s de vanguardia y m\u00e1s underground: Soft Machine\". David Ponce, Musica Popular, retrieved on 23 October 2014 Paula studied in the \"Colegio Latinoamericano de Integracion\" or \"Latin American Integration School\", known for its opposition to the military government. She says: \"I loved my school, but hippie music quickly started to bother me, all these \"pe\u00f1as\" (\u201cin Chile, Folk music encounters\u201d) seemed boring. The Left identified with that kind of music: \"Canto Nuevo\", \"charango\" and \"guitar\". I love Brazilian music, I've heard amazing modern Latin American stuff. I love cumbia. By then I started to develop my own taste\".Chica Paula at Musica Popular (ES) \"Mi colegio me encant\u00f3, pero la m\u00fasica hippy r\u00e1pidamente me empez\u00f3 a cargar. Me parec\u00edan una lata todas esas pe\u00f1as. La izquierda estaba identificada con ese tipo de m\u00fasica: Canto Nuevo, charango y guitarras. Me fascina la m\u00fasica brasilera, escucho cosas latinoamericanas modernas incre\u00edbles, me encanta la cumbia. Pero en ese momento empec\u00e9 a tener mi propio gusto\". David Ponce, Musica Popular, retrieved on 23 October 2014 Paula was more interested in the avant garde electronic music sent by her brother than the politically charged music of her peers, and found little else to interest her in the limited music scene under the military dictatorship.\"La cultura chilena bajo Augusto Pinochet\" (ES) chrestomathy.cofc.edu/ LeAnn Chapleau retrieved on 27 October In 1990, Paula went to university to study philosophy, but before the end of the first year she was back in Germany, attracted and fascinated by the development of what would become techno culture. It was her first time visiting Germany since she moved to Chile with her mother. ==Career== At the age of 25, Paula began her career as DJ in Germany. In 1995, she met Gudrun Gut, founder of Berlin electronic music collective Oceanclub. Paula joined the collective and got a residency at the Tresor club for the Oceanclub's Sunday night events, alongside DJs and producers such as Thomas Fehlmann (The Orb), Mike Vamp and bands like Sun Electric. As well as frequent gigs in Berlin, she has played sets from Detroit to Moscow to Buenos Aires and extensively through Europe, at places such as Rote Sonne (Munich), Culture Box (Copenhagen), Zukunft (Z\u00fcrich) and Le Triptyque (Paris) to name just a few. She has also played at a wide range of international festivals such as Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim Valencia, MUTEK, Popkomm, Love Parade and Detroit's DEMF.Chica Paula Bio at Resident Advisor residentadvisor.net retrieved on 28 October 2014 Paula didn't return to Chile until 1996 when her brothers, managed by producer \"Microman\", began to schedule some events in Chile. Some of the DJs taking part included Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano (Lucien Nicolet), and the German Uwe Schmidt (Atom Heart), all key figures in the development and spread of the electronic music movement in Chile. Her first release for Monika Enterprise (Gudrun Gut's label) came in the shape of a 12\", the \"Foxy EP\" in 2003. Also in 2003, with years of experience as a DJ and several records and remixes, Chica Paula released her first album, \"42 m\u00e4dchen\" (42 Girls), again on the German label Monika Enterprise, under the name \"Chica and the Folder\". Her main supporter was German producer \"Max Loderbauer\", a member of the electronic music group Sun Electric. The album \"42 m\u00e4dchen\" include some collaborators and sounds from a variety of different genres: Punk, traditional Tibetan music and electropop. One of the tracks includes the last words of Salvador Allende in La Moneda Palace, the voice of Jorge Gonzalez, and a remix of Brian Eno's \"I'll come running\". After the release of her first album, Paula kept performing as a DJ and took part in the German-Chilean lineup of the 2004 Mutek Festival in Valparaiso, and the same year participated in the Techno-Femenino festival in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Four years after the release of her first album came the second Chica Paula and the Folder album \"Under the Balcony\", along with a 12\" called \"Mixes From The Balcony\" featuring remixes by Paula's friend, the Chilean Ricardo Villalobos, and Swiss DJ Sonja Moonear. She said in an interview: \"As a DJ, I play more dance music, more of the moment, music with groove. The rest (making music) is a different story... Being a DJ is a public thing, making music is something more personal\".Chica Paula at Musica Popular (ES) \"Cuando soy DJ pongo m\u00e1s dance, m\u00e1s del momento, m\u00fasica de baile, de groove. Lo otro es otra historia. Hacer m\u00fasica es un paso. Est\u00e1 vinculado porque es m\u00fasica, pero la parte m\u00e1s emocional la vinculo m\u00e1s como un mundo privado, no lo veo como un desarrollo l\u00f3gico de DJ a m\u00fasico. El DJ es una cosa p\u00fablica y la m\u00fasica es m\u00e1s personal\". David Ponce, Musica Popular, retrieved on 23 October 2014 Paula also took part in a performance of Chilean-born German artists at the 2006 Sundeck Festival in Muelle Bar\u00f3n, Valpara\u00edso, along with Max Loderbauer, her partner in the project \"Chica and the Folder\". On top of her work as a DJ, producer, performer and remixer, Paula is currently also active as an advisor on the subject of electronic music to the Goethe Institut in Mexico, for whom she is managing a new radio project. ==Discography== === As Chica Paula === ;Remixes: * Roman, \u201cTraffic\u201d (Chica Paula's Super Emo Mix) \u2013 Kalk Pets, 2011 * Maluco, \u201cRight Time la del Barrio Mix\u201d \u2013 Kalk Pets, 2009 * Donna Regina, \u201cPlaying free\u201d (Chica Paula & Tobias Mix) \u2013 Kalk Pets, 2008 * Contriva, \u201cDust\u201d (Chica Paula Mix) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2003 === As Chica and the Folder (Chica Paula and Max Loderbauer) === ;Releases: * Mixes of the Balcony, feat. remixes from Ricardo Villalobos, Sonja Moonear and Pikaya (EP 12\u201d) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2007 * Under the Balcony (CD, Album) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2007 * Schatulle, feat. remixes from Luciano, Pink Elln, Dinky and Thomas Fehlmann (CD, EP 12\u201d) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2003 * 42 M\u00e4dchen (CD, Album) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2003 ;Remixes: * Hauschka \u201cGinko Remix\u201d (CD) \u2013 Karaoke Kalk, 2006 * Laurenz Pike \u201cDrums for Fun and Fitness (Shakesbeer Mix)\u201d \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2006 * Shakebeer Mix (10\u201d) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2005 ;Compilations: * Music for Children (CD, 12\u201d) \u2013 Bruchstuecke, 2003 ;DJ mixes: * \u201cSchaukeln 2\u201d DJ Mix (Digital) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2007 * \u201cSchaukeln 1\u201d DJ Mix (Digital) \u2013 Monika Enterprise, 2004 ; Appears on: * M.A.N.D.Y \u2013 Renaissance: The Mix Collection, \u201cPerfect Day\u201d (Pikaya Remix) \u2013 Renaissance, 2009 * Dj Marcelle/Another Nice Mess \u2013 Meets Her Soulmates At Faust Studio Deejay Laboratory, \u201cKleines Hoppla\u201d Klangbad, 2008 * New Trade Order, \u201cSouffl\u00e9\u201d \u2013 Monika Enterprise, Rubaiyat \u2013 Monirubi 01, 2008 Gustaff Ina Pill Vol.6, \"D\u00edas Amarillos\" \u2013 Gustaff Records, 2008 * La Plan\u00e8te Blue Vol5, \"Perfect Day (Sometimes)\" \u2013 Radio Suisse Romande, 2008 Dinky \u2013 Get Lost 03, \u201cSouffl\u00e8\u201d (Sonja Moonear Dans Ma Casbah Mix) \u2013 Croston Rebels, 2007 * Monika B\u00e4rchen: Songs For Bruno, Knut&Tom;, \u201cKleines Hoppla\u201d Monika Enterprises, 2007 * Monika Force, \u201cI\u2019ll Come Running\u201d \u2013 Monika Enterprises, 2005 * Back To Glamour, Der Wolf Und P \u2013 Hi-Lo, Tunez, 2004 * Monika Enterprise 10 Years Compilation, \u201cKleines Hoppla\u201d- Monika Enterprise, 2007 == See also == * Music of Chile * Chilean Electronic Music * Luciano (DJ) * Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez * Ricardo Villalobos == References == == External links == * http://paulaschopf.de/ * Chica Paula on Discogs * Chica Paula Bio at Resident Advisor Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean musicians Category:People from Santiago Category:Chilean DJs Category:Chilean people of German descent ",
