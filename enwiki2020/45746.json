Roughly long, it is the third- longest European mountain range after the Urals at and the Scandinavian Mountains at . The range stretches from the far eastern Czech Republic (3%) in the northwest through Slovakia (17%), Poland (10%), Hungary (4%) and Ukraine (10%) Serbia (5%) and Romania (50%) in the southeast. \"The Carpathians\" European Travel Commission, in The Official Travel Portal of Europe, Retrieved 15 November 2016 The Carpathian Project: Carpathian Mountains in Serbia, Institute for Spatial Planning, Faculty of Geography, University of Belgrade (2008), Retrieved: 15 November 2016 Bulletin of the Natural History Museum, pg. 54, Valuing the geological heritage of Serbia (UDC: 502.171:55(497.11), Aleksandra Maran (2010), Retrieved 15 November 2016 The highest range within the Carpathians is known as the Tatra mountains in Slovakia and Poland, where the highest peaks exceed .

The Carpathians provide habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois, and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania, as well as over one third of all European plant species. The mountains and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total.Bucure\u015fti, sta\u0163iune balnear\u0103 \u2013 o glum\u0103 bun\u0103? in Capital, 19 January 2009.

Although the toponym was recorded already by Ptolemy in the second century of the Christian era, the modern form of the name is a neologism in most languages. For instance, Havasok (\"Snowy Mountains\") was its medieval Hungarian name; Russian chronicles referred to it as \"Hungarian Mountains\". Later sources, such as Dimitrie Cantemir and the Italian chronicler Giovanandrea Gromo, referred to the range as \"Transylvania's Mountains\", while the 17th-century historian Constantin Cantacuzino translated the name of the mountains in an Italian-Romanian glossary to \"Rumanian Mountains\". The name \"Carpates\" is highly associated with the old Dacian tribes called \"Carpes\" or \"Carpi\" who lived in a large area from the east, north-east of the Black Sea to Transylvanian plains on the present day Romania and Moldova. The name Carpates may ultimately be from the Proto Indo-European root *sker-/*ker-, from which comes the Albanian word karp\u00eb (rock), and the Slavic word sk\u00e1la (rock, cliff), perhaps via a Dacian cognate which meant mountain, rock, or rugged (cf. Germanic root *skerp-, Old Norse \"harrow\", Gothic skarpo, Middle Low German scharf \"potsherd\", and Modern High German Scherbe \"shard\", Old English and English sharp, Lithuanian kar~pas \"cut, hack, notch\", Latvian c\u00ecrpt \"to shear, clip\"). The archaic Polish word karpa meant \"rugged irregularities, underwater obstacles/rocks, rugged roots, or trunks\". The more common word skarpa means a sharp cliff or other vertical terrain. The name may instead come from Indo-European * \"to turn\", akin to Old English \"to turn, change\" (English warp) and Greek \"wrist\", perhaps referring to the way the mountain range bends or veers in an L-shape.Room, Adrian. Placenames of the World. London: MacFarland and Co., Inc., 1997. Another explanation is that the name came with ancient Armenian civilization during their settlement of the central and eastern European continents. Even in modern Armenian \u201ckar\u201d or \u201cqar\u201d (\u0584\u0561\u0580 in Armenian) means Stone and \u201cpat\u201d (\u057a\u0561\u057f in Armenian) means Wall. Thus the name Karpaty literally means StoneWall or Wall of Stone in Armenian (\u0584\u0561\u0580\u057a\u0561\u057f or \u0584\u0561\u0580\u0565 \u057a\u0561\u057f). In late Roman documents, the Eastern Carpathian Mountains were referred to as Montes Sarmatici (meaning Sarmatian Mountains).E.g. in work Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, Asiana et Europiana, et de contentis in eis by Mathias de Miechow, first edition from 1517. Second book, chapter 1. The Western Carpathians were called Carpates, a name that is first recorded in Ptolemy's Geographia (second century AD). In the Scandinavian Hervarar saga, which relates ancient Germanic legends about battles between Goths and Huns, the name Karpates appears in the predictable Germanic form as Harva\u00f0a fj\u00f6llum (see Grimm's law). \"Inter Alpes Huniae et Oceanum est Polonia\" (\"Between the Hunic Alps and the ocean lies Poland\") by Gervase of Tilbury, has described in his Otia Imperialia (\"Recreation for an Emperor\") in 1211. Thirteenth- to fifteenth-century Hungarian documents named the mountains Thorchal, Tarczal, or less frequently Montes Nivium (\"Snowy Mountains\"). alt= == Geography == Maramure\u0219. Mountains in north of Romania Mukachevo, Western Ukraine View from Sanok in Poland The northwestern Carpathians begin in Slovakia and southern Poland. They surround Transcarpathia and Transylvania in a large semicircle, sweeping towards the southeast, and end on the Danube near Or\u015fova in Romania. The total length of the Carpathians is over and the mountain chain's width varies between . The highest altitudes of the Carpathians occur where they are widest. The system attains its greatest breadth in the Transylvanian plateau and in the southern Tatra Mountains group - the highest range, in which Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt in Slovakia is the highest peak at above sea level. The Carpathians cover an area of , and after the Alps, form the next-most extensive mountain system in Europe.

Rather, they consist of several orographically and geologically distinctive groups, presenting as great a structural variety as the Alps. The Carpathians, which attain an altitude over in only a few places, lack the bold peaks, extensive snowfields, large glaciers, high waterfalls, and numerous large lakes that are common in the Alps. It was believed that no area of the Carpathian range was covered in snow all year round and there were no glaciers, but recent research by Polish scientists discovered one permafrost and glacial area in the Tatra Mountains. The Carpathians at their highest altitude are only as high as the middle region of the Alps, with which they share a common appearance, climate, and flora. The Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the Danube. The two ranges meet at only one point: the Leitha Mountains at Bratislava. The river also separates them from the Balkan Mountains at Or\u015fova in Romania. The valley of the March and Oder separates the Carpathians from the Silesian and Moravian chains, which belong to the middle wing of the great Central Mountain System of Europe. Unlike the other wings of the system, the Carpathians, which form the watershed between the northern seas and the Black Sea, are surrounded on all sides by plains, namely the Pannonian plain to the southwest, the Lower Danubian Plain to the south, with the southern part being in Bulgaria, and the northern - in (Romania), and the Galician plain to the northeast. ===Cities and towns=== Important cities and towns in or near the Carpathians are, in approximate descending order of population: * Vienna (Vienna Woods, Austria) * Krak\u00f3w (Poland) * Bratislava (Slovakia) * Cluj-Napoca (Romania) * Chernivtsi (Ukraine) * Bra\u015fov (Romania) * Ko\u0161ice (Slovakia) * Ivano-Frankivsk (Ukraine) * Oradea (Romania) * Bielsko- Bia\u0142a (Poland) * Miskolc (Hungary) * Sibiu (Romania) * T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (Romania) * Baia Mare (Romania) * Uzhhorod (Ukraine) * Tarn\u00f3w (Poland) * R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea (Romania) * Pre\u0161ov (Slovakia) * Mukachevo (Ukraine) * Drohobych (Ukraine) * Piatra Neam\u021b (Romania) * Nowy S\u0105cz (Poland) * Suceava (Romania) * Vr\u0161ac (Serbia) * T\u00e2rgu Jiu (Romania) * Drobeta-Turnu Severin (Romania) * Re\u0219i\u021ba (Romania) * \u017dilina (Slovakia) * Bistri\u021ba (Romania) * Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica (Slovakia) * Zvolen (Slovakia) * Deva (Romania) * Zl\u00edn (Czech Republic) * Hunedoara (Romania) * Martin (Slovakia) * Zal\u0103u (Romania) * Przemy\u015bl (Poland) * Krosno (Poland) * Sanok (Poland) * Alba Iulia (Romania) * Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe (Romania) * Turda (Romania) * Media\u0219 (Romania) * Poprad (Slovakia) * Petro\u0219ani (Romania) * Miercurea Ciuc (Romania) * F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 (Romania) * Odorheiu Secuiesc (Romania) * Jas\u0142o (Poland) * Cieszyn (Poland) * Nowy Targ (Poland) * \u017bywiec (Poland) * Zakopane (Poland) * Petrila (Romania) * Cugir (Romania) * T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b (Romania) * C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc (Romania) * Gheorgheni (Romania) * Rakhiv (Ukraine) * Vatra Dornei (Romania) * Rabka-Zdr\u00f3j (Poland) * Bor (Serbia) ===Highest peaks=== This is an (incomplete) list of the peaks of the Carpathians having summits over , with their heights, geologic divisions, and locations. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !

GSA Special Papers, v. 409, p. 15-41 The mountains take the form of a fold and thrust belt with generally north vergence in the western segment, northeast to east vergence in the eastern portion and southeast vergence in the southern portion. The external, generally northern, portion of the orogenic belt is a Tertiary accretionary wedge of a so-called Flysch belt (the Carpathian Flysch Belt) created by rocks scraped off the sea bottom and thrust over the North- European plate. The Carpathian accretionary wedge is made of several thin skinned nappes composed of Cretaceous to Paleogene turbidites. Thrusting of the Flysch nappes over the Carpathian foreland caused the formation of the Carpathian foreland basin.Nehyba, S., \u0160ikula, J., 2007, Depositional architecture, sequence stratigraphy and geodynamic development of the Carpathian Foredeep (Czech Republic). Geologica Carpathica, 58, 1, pp. 53-69 The boundary between the Flysch belt and internal zones of the orogenic belt in the western segment of the mountain range is marked by the Pieniny Klippen Belt, a narrow complicated zone of polyphase compressional deformation, later involved in a supposed strike-slip zone.Mi\u0161\u00edk, M., 1997, The Slovak Part of the Pieniny Klippen Belt After the Pioneering Works of D.

After the Roman emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia, he brought back to Rome over 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver. ==Ecology== The ecology of the Carpathians varies with altitude, ranging from lowland forests to alpine meadows. Foothill forests are primarily of broadleaf deciduous trees, including oak, hornbeam, and linden. European beech is characteristic of the montane forest zone. Higher-elevation subalpine forests are characterized by Norway spruce (Picea abies). Krummholtz and alpine meadows occur above the treeline. Wildlife in the Carpathians includes brown bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), European wildcat (Felis silvestris), Tatra chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica), European bison (Bison bonasus), and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). ==Divisions of the Carpathians== right|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the main divisions of the Carpathians. 1\\. Outer Western Carpathians 2\\. Inner Western Carpathians 3\\. Outer Eastern Carpathians 4\\. Inner Eastern Carpathians 5\\. Southern Carpathians 6\\. Western Romanian Carpathians 7\\. Transylvanian Plateau 8\\. Serbian Carpathians The largest range is the Tatras in Slovakia and Poland. A major part of the western and northeastern Outer Eastern Carpathians in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia is traditionally called the Eastern Beskids. The geological border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians runs approximately along the line (south to north) between the towns of Michalovce, Bardejov, Nowy S\u0105cz and Tarn\u00f3w. In older systems the border runs more in the east, along the line (north to south) along the rivers San and Os\u0142awa (Poland), the town of Snina (Slovakia) and river Tur'ia (Ukraine). Biologists, however, shift the border even further to the east. The border between the eastern and southern Carpathians is formed by the Predeal Pass, south of Bra\u015fov and the Prahova Valley. In geopolitical terms, Carpathian Mountains are often grouped and labeled according to national or regional borders, but such division has turned out to be relative, since it was, and still is dependent on frequent historical, political and administrative changes of national or regional borders. According to modern geopolitical division, Carpathians can be grouped as: Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech, Austrian, and Hungarian. Within each nation, specific classifications of the Carpathians have been developing, often reflecting local traditions, and thus creating terminological diversity, that produces various challenges in the fields of comparative classification and international systematization. Section of the Carpathians within borders of Romania is commonly known as the Romanian Carpathians. In local use, Romanians sometimes denote as \"Eastern Carpathians\" only the Romanian part of the Eastern Carpathians, which lies on their territory (i.e., from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south), which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups (northern, central, southern), instead of Outer and Inner Eastern Carpathians. These groups are: * Maramure\u0219-Bukovinian Carpathians (Romanian: Carpa\u021bii Maramure\u0219ului \u0219i ai Bucovinei) * Moldavian-Transylvanian Carpathians (Romanian: Carpa\u021bii Moldo-Transilvani) * Curvature Carpathians (Romanian: Carpa\u021bii Curburii, Carpa\u021bii de Curbur\u0103) Section of the Carpathians within borders of Ukraine is commonly known as the Ukrainian Carpathians. Classification of eastern sections of the Carpathians is particularly complex, since it was influenced by several overlapping traditions. Terms like Wooded Carpathians, Poloniny Mountains or Eastern Beskids are often used in varying scopes by authors belonging to different traditions. ==See also== * * * * Tourism in Poland * Tourism in Serbia * Tourism in Romania * Tourism in Slovakia * Tourism in Ukraine * Sudetes ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 1 \u2014 Carpathian Mountains, by Volodymyr Kubijovy\u010d (1984). * Carpathianconvention.org: The Framework Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians * Orographic map highlighting Carpathian mountains * Alpinet.org: Romanian mountain guide * Carpati.org: Romanian mountain guide * Pgi.gov.pl: Oil and Gas Fields in the Carpathians * Video: Beautiful mountains Carpathians, Ukraine 01 Category:Mountain ranges of Europe Category:Mountain ranges of the Czech Republic Category:Mountain ranges of Hungary Category:Mountain ranges of Poland Category:Mountain ranges of Romania Category:Mountain ranges of Slovakia Category:Mountain ranges of Ukraine Category:Geography of Central Europe Category:Geography of Eastern Europe Category:Geography of Southeastern Europe Category:Saga locations Category:Physiographic provinces ",
