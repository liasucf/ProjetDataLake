He is the elected member for Wagga Wagga in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since the 2018 by-election. ABC News declared him the winner on 9 September, the day after the election, with the New South Wales Electoral Commission confirming it on 14 September. He came second to the Liberal candidate by only 28 votes after the Liberals' primary vote almost halved from 2015, and was elected on Labor preferences. He previously contested the seat in 2011 and received 30.6% of the first preference vote. McGirr's grandfather was Greg McGirr, a Labor member of the Legislative Assembly from 1913 to 1925, and Deputy Premier from 1921 to 1922, who was briefly Labor Leader in 1923. His great-uncle, James McGirr, was the Premier of New South Wales from 1947 to 1952.
