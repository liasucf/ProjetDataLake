    "text": "Half Written Story is the second extended play (EP) by American singer Hailee Steinfeld, released on May 8, 2020, through Republic Records. It is considered the first half of a two-piece project, being supplemented by her upcoming third EP that was initially scheduled to be released in summer 2020. Also, it is Steinfeld's first release since her debut EP Haiz in November 2015. The EP is supported by two singles, \"Wrong Direction\" and \"I Love You's\". ==Background and recording== After the release of Haiz, Steinfeld began recording new music for an album project in January 2017 while filming Pitch Perfect 3. That year, Steinfeld released the singles \"Most Girls\" and \"Let Me Go\" that were intended to be a part of the album. In March 2018, Steinfeld confirmed that she was finishing her album and intended to release it in 2018. The following December, after the album wasn't released, Steinfeld confirmed that after finishing filming Dickinson in January 2019, she would be \"finishing what [she] started\" with her music and releasing the album in 2019. On March 26, 2020, it was reported that Steinfeld would release a two-part project in 2020 with the first part being released on May 1, 2020. Steinfeld later announced on April 24, 2020 that the project's first part's release was being pushed to May 8, 2020, due to her needing more time to perfect it. The project's first part was finished that month. On April 27, 2020, Steinfeld announced that the project's first part would be called Half Written Story as well as revealing its cover art and track list. The EP got its name from a lyrics in \"Your Name Hurts\" saying \"we're a half-written story without any ending\" and \"this half-written story is horror at best\". ==Music and lyrics== Half Written Story is primarily a pop music record with lyrics that discuss heartbreak and strength. The EP contains five tracks. It opens with \"I Love You's\" an upbeat romantic pop anthem about self love and hope. Sampling \"No More I Love You's\" by Annie Lennox, the song's production consists of \"floaty\" synths and \"peppy\" beats. \"Your Name Hurts\" is a retro R&B; track that according to Steinfeld is about when \"a person's name can go from [making] your heart skip a beat to something that makes you feel nauseous.\" \"End This (L.O.V.E.)\" is a \"minor-key lament\" where Steinfeld was inspired by Bea Miller's \"S.L.U.T.\" to make a song with an abbreviation that has a flipped meaning. The song samples the melody from \"L-O-V-E\" by Nat King Cole and sees Steinfeld singing in a lower range. \"Man Up\" is a hip hop-influenced pop-rap song that \"coheres into a believably messy portrait of love\u2019s aftermath\". The closing track and lead single, \"Wrong Direction\" is an \"emotional\" tearjerker piano ballad that addresses a past relationship. ==Singles== \"Wrong Direction\" was released as the EP's lead single on January 1, 2020. It was followed by \"I Love You's\" on March 26, 2020. ==Critical reception== Half Written Story received mixed reviews from critics. Chris DeVille of Stereogum complimented the EP's improvement of Steinfeld's music stating \"Half Written Story presents a slightly more fully-formed vision of Steinfeld the singer\" and \"together [Koz] and Steinfeld have constructed a collection that, if not exactly brimming with idiosyncrasies, conveys more of the charm and sass that typify her onscreen work\". Steve Baltin of Forbes called the EP \"stellar\" as well as writing \"When you hear her intimate, her attitude in the joyous pop, the production and the passion she brings to the first five songs it is clear her love of music is genuine\". Natalie Weiner of Variety criticized the EP's choice of songs writing \"The desire to make a meatier banger is clearly there, given how long she\u2019s been at it and the kind of material she chooses; she has the voice and the baseline taste level. It\u2019s hard to imagine, though, that any of these songs will make her a recognizable force in pop.\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard also criticized the EP's choice of songs writing \"none of the songs sound like surefire radio staples\" but also complimented the EP writing \"the five new songs are the most experimental, and personal, of Steinfeld's career.\" Writing for i-D, Douglas Greenwood called the EP a \"belter\" as well as saying it's a \"searingly honest mini collection of proper pop songs.\" Mathias Rosenzweig of V called it \"a raw and emotive body of work for the starlet\". Katrina Rees of CelebMix gave a favourable review writing \"Half Written Story is a cohesive offering which showcases Hailee\u2019s growth as an artist\" and \"Hailee has delivered an impressive EP which exhibits confidence and vulnerability in equal measure.\" ==Track listing== ===Notes=== * \"I Love You's\" samples \"No More I Love You's\" by Annie Lennox, written by Joseph Hughes and David Freeman. * \"End This (L.O.V.E.)\" samples the melody from \"L-O-V-E\" by Nat King Cole, written by Bert Kaempfert and Milt Gabler. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal, Instagram, and Universal Music Canada. ===Performers=== * Hailee Steinfeld \u2013 vocals * Elizabeth Lowell Boland \u2013 backing vocals , piano * Todd Clark \u2013 backing vocals * Caroline Pennell \u2013 backing vocals * Skyler Stonestreet \u2013 backing vocals * Koz \u2013 drums , bass synthesizer * Hrag Sanbalian \u2013 synthesizer ===Technical=== * Koz \u2013 executive production, production, programming * David Stewart \u2013 production, programming * D'Mile \u2013 production, programming * The 23rd \u2013 production, programming * John Hanes \u2013 engineering, studio personnel * Matt Snell \u2013 assistant recording engineering, studio personnel * Phil Hotz \u2013 assistant recording engineering, studio personnel * Drew Jurecka \u2013 string arranging * Serban Ghenea \u2013 mixing, studio personnel * Matty Green \u2013 mixing, studio personnel * Josh Gudwin \u2013 mixing, studio personnel * Jamie Snell \u2013 mixing, studio personnel * Ewan Vickery \u2013 assistant mixing, studio personnel * Randy Merrill \u2013 mastering, studio personnel ===Design=== * Allison Snyder \u2013 creative direction * Julie Vastola \u2013 creative direction * Juan Manuel Villarreal \u2013 design * Danna Galeano \u2013 animation * Katia Temkin \u2013 animation ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Download Albums (OCC) | 97 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Current Albums (Billboard) | 63 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | May 8, 2020 | | Republic | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==References== Category:Hailee Steinfeld albums Category:Republic Records EPs Category:2020 EPs ",
