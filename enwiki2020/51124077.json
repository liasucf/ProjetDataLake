    "text": "The 1974\u201375 Virginia Squires season was the 5th season of the Squires in the American Basketball Association. The Squires, having sold talents such as Julius Erving and George Gervin in previous years in order to keep afloat, simply imploded with a lack of talent, losing 69 games, the worst in ABA history. Their longest winning streak was 3 games, from January 31-February 3. At one point, they lost 15 straight games, from December 30 to January 26. The only victory they scored in March turned out to be their final victory as the team lost 8 straight to close out the season. The team finished last in points per game at 99.0, with a middling 6th in points allowed with 109.5 per game.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/VIR/1975.html ==Roster== * 33 Lloyd Batts - Shooting guard * 52 Lionel Billingy - Point forward * 20 Glen Combs - Shooting guard * 11 Darrell Elston - Shooting guard * 15 Lamar Green - Point forward * 14 Bill Higgins - Shooting guard * 30 George Irvine - Small forward * 31 Mike Jackson - Point forward * 44 Johnny Neumann - Shooting guard * 40 Barry Parkhill - Shooting guard * 22 Aulcie Perry - Center * 5 Cincy Powell - Small forward * 24 Red Robbins - Center * 13 Dave Twardzik - Point guard * 45 David Vaughn - Center * 42 Willie Wise - Small forward ==Final standings== === Eastern Division === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
