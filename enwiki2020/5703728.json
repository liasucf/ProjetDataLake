    "text": "The De\u00e7an Bistrica or De\u00e7an's Lumbardh ( / De\u010danska Bistrica, or Lumbardhi i De\u00e7anit) is a river in Kosovo. This 53 km-long right tributary to the White Drin river flows entirely within the western part of Kosovo (the Metohija/Dukagjini region). == Name == The name of the river, Bistrica, means \"clearwater\" in Serbian. The adjective De\u010danska, \"of De\u010dani\", is added to distinguish it from other Bistrica rivers in the Metohija region: Pe\u0107 Bistrica (\"of Pe\u0107\"), Prizren Bistrica (\"of Prizren\"), Ko\u017enjar Bistrica (\"of Ko\u017enjar\"), Lo\u0107ane Bistrica (\"of Lo\u0107ane\"), etc. == Prokletije and Gorge of De\u00e7an == De\u00e7an Bistrica originates from the southern slopes of the Bogi\u0107evica mountain, a part of the massive Prokletije mountain system. The river flows north of the \u0110eravica peak, the highest in Kosovo (2,656 m), initially under the name of Ko\u017enjarska Bistrica, and receives many streams from the Bogi\u0107evica, Micinat, Stre\u010doka and Kopranik mountains. The river turns southeast on the northern slopes of the Koprivnik and Stre\u010doka mountains, where it carved the deep gorge of De\u00e7an (De\u010danska klisura). The upper part of the gorge is the glacial trough of the ancient De\u00e7an glacier on the Prokletije mountain. == Metohija region == As the river flows out of the gorge it reaches the medieval monastery of Visoki De\u010dani, which is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The river continues eastward, in the very densely populated area next to the small town of De\u010dani and the villages of Istini\u0107, Beleg, Brdli\u0107, Vranovac and Jablanica, before it empties into the White Drin. In the upper course, the waters of the river are used for the Ko\u017enjar hydroelectrical power plant (6.5 MW). In the lower parts its waters are, to some extent, used for irrigation. The De\u010dani Bistrica belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, drains itself an area of 300 km\u00b2, and it is not navigable. == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
