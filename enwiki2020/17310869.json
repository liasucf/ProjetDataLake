Under Swaminarayan\u2019s leadership the sampradaya grew to more than 100,000 followers and 3,000 swamis (monks) by the time of his death in 1830. Early in his leadership of the group, Sahajanand Swami directed his devotees to chant the Swaminarayan mantra, which is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Swami and Narayan. Both the religious group and then its leader became popularly known by the new mantra they had begun chanting, Swaminarayan. In the Vachanamrut, the principal theological text of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan identifies five eternal and distinct entities: Parabrahman, Aksharbrahman, maya (m\u0101y\u0101), ishwar (i\u015bvara), and jiva (j\u012bva). He further explains that the ultimate goal of life is moksha (mok\u1e63a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths that is characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. Swaminarayan instituted the sampradaya\u2019s mandir tradition to facilitate followers\u2019 devotional worship of God. During his lifetime, Swaminarayan constructed six mandirs: Ahmedabad (1822), Bhuj (1823), Vadtal (1824), Dholera (1826), Junagadh (1828), and Gadhada (1828). Socially, Swaminarayan\u2019s doctrine that everyone\u2019s true self is the atman within which God resides, led him to reject caste-based discrimination within the religious community. Swaminarayan also inspired followers to engage in humanitarian service activities, leading various denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya to currently provide humanitarian service globally. After Swaminarayan\u2019s death, different interpretations of successorship have emerged resulting in numerous groups within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya that regard Swaminarayan as God but differ in their theology and the religious leadership they accept. Due to the commentarial work of Bhadreshdas Swami, Swaminarayan's teachings were recognized as a separate school of Vedanta by the Shri Kashi Vidvat Parishad in 2017BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute, HH Mahant Swami Maharaj Inaugurates the Sv\u0101min\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47asiddh\u0101ntasudh\u0101 and Announces Parabrahman Sv\u0101min\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s Dar\u015bana as the Ak\u1e63ara-Puru\u1e63ottama Dar\u015banaBAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Acclamation by th Sri Kasi Vidvat Parisad and by members of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference in 2018.17th World Sanskrit Conference Recognizes Bhagwan Swaminarayan\u2019s Akshar-Purushottam Darshan as a Distinct Vedanta Tradition == Early history == ===Sahajanand Swami=== The Swaminarayan Sampradaya, founded in 1801, takes its name from its founder, Swaminarayan, also known as Sahajanand Swami. Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 in the village of Chhapaiya in present- day Uttar Pradesh, India. After his parents\u2019 death, he renounced his home at the age of 11 and traveled for 7 years as a child yogi around India before settling in the hermitage of Ramanand Swami, a Vaishnava religious leader in present-day Gujarat. Ramanand Swami initiated him as Sahajanand Swami on 28 October 1800 and appointed him to be his successor and the leader of the sampradaya in 1801, giving him the second name, Narayan Muni. Textual sources from as early as 1804 indicate Sahajanand Swami was regarded as the manifestation of God, and over his life, he would be worshipped as God by thousands of followers. Ramanand Swami died on 17 December 1801. Upon the conclusion of his funeral rites, Sahajanand Swami directed devotees to chant a new mantra: Swaminarayan (Sv\u0101m\u012bn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). The word Swaminarayan is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Swami (Sv\u0101m\u012b) and Narayan (N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a). There are various interpretations of the mantra, with some branches believing the name refers to one entity, while others believe that that Swami denotes Aksharbrahman (God's ideal devotee), namely Gunatitanand Swami, as identified by Sahajanand Swami, and Narayan denotes Parabrahman (God), a reference to Sahajanand Swami himself. The latter interpretation recalls an earlier Vaishnava tradition of the divine companionship between the perfect devotee and God (for example, Radha and Krishna or Shri and Vishnu). As devotees began to chant this new Swaminarayan mantra, society began to identify the group by the mantra they chanted, thus referring to the group as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Soon after, the group\u2019s new leader, Sahajanand Swami, was also popularly identified by the mantra he had given, and became known as Swaminarayan. The sampradaya grew quickly over the 30 years under Swaminarayan\u2019s leadership, with British sources estimating at least 100,000 followers by the 1820s. Before his death, Swaminarayan divided his followers into two administrative dioceses, separate from the spiritual lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus. Swaminarayan died on 1 June 1830, but the sampradaya continued to grow, with British officials estimating it had 288,000 followers by 1872. === Early monasticism === Swaminarayan and his senior disciplesSwaminarayan's ministry \"faced great opposition,\" most strongly in the first fifteen years untill the arrival of the British colonisators in Gujarat. A number of attempts at his life, \"by both religious and secular powers,\" are reported. His followers also faced harassment, particularly his swamis (monks). Swaminarayan had instructed the swamis to maintain an austere code of conduct as part of their spiritual practice. This code of conduct included refraining from retaliation when harassed by others, which left them vulnerable to physical assault. To help them escape such harassment, at 30 June 1807 Swaminarayan ordained 500 swamis into the highest monastic order as paramhansas (paramha\u1e43sas), thereby allowing them to temporarily suspend certain practices, like applying sacred marks, that allowed opponents to identify them as one of his followers. Altogether, Swaminarayan ordained 3,000 swamis over the span of his leadership. The swamis expressed their devotion to Swaminarayan in various ways, ranging from composing bhakti poetry to authoring scriptural commentaries. Swaminarayan also encouraged his swamis to serve others. During the devastating famine of 1813-14 in Kathiawar, for example, the swamis collected alms in unaffected regions of Gujarat to distribute among the afflicted. ==Beliefs== Swaminarayan\u2019s teachings are found in the Vachanamrut (Vacan\u0101m\u1e5bta), the principal theological text of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be Parabrahman (Parabrahman, or Purushottam, Puru\u1e63ottama), his teachings are considered a direct revelation of God. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan describes that the ultimate goal of life is moksha (mok\u1e63a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths and characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. === Background === Swaminayaran's philosophy emerged within the Vedanta tradition, particularly the Vaishnava tradition as articulated by Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, and Chaitanya. He engaged with this Vedanta tradition by presenting his own theological system, which has similarities and differences with many of those that came before it. Some scholars highlight particular similarities with Ramanuja's Vishistadvaita and Swaminarayan\u2019s stated affinity for it to suggest that it served as foundational for Swaminarayan\u2019s philosophy. Other scholars point to significant differences between Swaminarayan\u2019s and Ramanuja\u2019s systems to assert fundamental metaphysical and philosophical divergences between the two. Raymond Williams explicitly notes that the Swaminarayan tradition\u2019s followers \u201care not Shrivaishnavas\u201d who affirm Ramanuja\u2019s philosophical tradition, while Paramtattvadas states that the similarities between Vishishtadvaita and Swaminarayan's theology lead those who do not have a complete understanding of the Swaminarayan Hindu tradition to \u201cerroneously identify it as a \u2018modified\u2019 version of Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita Ved\u0101nta.\u201d He cautions that one should not conflate the two distinct schools of Vedanta, nor should one then see Swaminarayan\u2019s philosophy as foundationally based in Ramanuja\u2019s. === Metaphysics === While his preference for Ramunaja\u2019s theology is stated in the sacred text, the Shikshapatri (\u015aik\u1e63\u0101patr\u012b), Swaminarayan actually teaches a significantly different system of metaphysics in the Vachanamrut. In Ramunaja\u2019s system, there are three entities: Parabrahman, maya (m\u0101y\u0101), and jiva (j\u012bva). Throughout the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan identifies five eternal and distinct entities: Parabrahman, Aksharbrahman (Ak\u1e63arabrahman, also Akshara, Ak\u1e63ara, or Brahman), maya, ishwar (\u012b\u015bvara), and jiva.See Gadhada I.7, Gadhada I.39, Gadhada I.42, Gadhada III.10 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Parabrahman is God, who is sarvopari (sarvopar\u012b, transcends all entities), karta (kart\u0101, omniagent), sakar (s\u0101k\u0101r, possesses an eternal and divine form), and pragat (pragat, forever manifests on Earth to liberate spiritual seekers).See Gadhada I.71, Loya 4, Kariyani 10, Vartal 19 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Swaminarayan taught that Purushottam, or God, possesses a divine form whose shape is human-like. Most followers believe that Swaminarayan was the \u2018manifest\u2019 form of this supreme God. By \u2018manifest\u2019, it is understood that the very same transcendent entity who possesses a divine form in his abode assumes a human form that is still \u201ctotally divine,\u201d but \u201caccessible\u201d to his human devotees. The majority of the followers believe thus that Swaminarayan was \u201cnot a manifestation of Krishna, as some believed,\u201d but the supreme entity superior to all other manifestations of God, including Rama and Krishna. These other manifestations of God, of which Rama and Krishna are two examples, are known as avatars, and Purushottam (or God) is believed to be \u201cmetaphysically different\u201d from them and their cause, the avatarin, whom Swaminarayan revealed as himself. Aksharbrahman, is the second highest entity and has four forms: 1) Parabrahman\u2019s divine abode; 2) the ideal devotee of Parabrahman, eternally residing in that divine abode; 3) the sentient substratum pervading and supporting the cosmos (chidakash, cid\u0101k\u0101\u015ba); and 4) the Aksharbrahman Guru, who serves as the manifest form of God on earth through whom God guides aspirants to moksha. This understanding of Akshar having four forms is one of the features that distinguishes Swaminarayan\u2019s theology from others. In Vachanamrut Gadhada I-63, Swaminarayan emphasizes the need to understand Akshar in order to understand God (Parabrahman) perfectly and completely. Maya refers to the universal material source used by Parabrahman to create the world.See Gadhada I.13, Gadhada III.10, Loya 17 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Maya has three gunas (gu\u1e47as, qualities) which are found to varying degrees in everything formed of it: serenity (sattva), passion (rajas), and darkness (tamas).See Loya 10 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Maya also refers to the ignorance which enshrouds both ishwars and jivas, which results in their bondage to the cycle of births and deaths (transmigration) and subsequently suffering.See Gadhada I.13, Gadhada I.1, Gadhada II.36, Gadhada III.39 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Ishwars are sentient beings responsible for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos, at the behest of Parabrahman.See Gadhada II.31, Gadhada II.66, Gadhada III.38, Sarangpur 1, Panchala 4 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . While they are metaphysically higher than jivas, they too are bound by maya and must transcend it to attain moksha.See Gadhada II.31, Kariyani 12, Sarangpur 5, Panchala 2 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Jivas, also known as atmans, are distinct, eternal entities, composed of consciousness that can reside in bodies, animating them. The jiva is inherently pure and flawless, though under the influence of maya, jivas falsely believe themselves to be the bodies they inhabit and remain bound to the cycle of transmigration.See Gadhada I.21, Gadhada I.44, Gadhada III.22, Gadhada III.39, Jetalpur 2 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . === Moksha === In Swaminarayan\u2019s soteriology, the ultimate goal of life is moksha, a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. To attain moksha, an individual must overcome the ignorance of maya, which Swaminarayan describes as self-identification with the physical body, personal talents, and material possessions.See Gadhada II.50, Gadhada III.39, Kariyani 12 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Swaminarayan explains in the Vachanamrut that ekantik dharma is a means to earn God\u2019s grace and attain liberation. Ekantik dharma (ek\u0101ntik dharma) consists of dharma (dharma; religious and moral duties), gnan (j\u00f1\u0101na; realization of the atman and Paramatman) vairagya (vair\u0101gya; dispassion for worldly objects), and bhakti (bhakti; devotion to God coupled with the understanding of God\u2019s greatness).See Gadhada II.21, Gadhada III.21, Sarangpur 11 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . The jiva must become brahmarup (brahmar\u016bp), or like Aksharbrahman, under the guidance of the manifest form of God to attain moksha.See Gadhada I.21, Gadhada II.28, Gadhada II.45, Gadhada II.66, Gadhada III.2, Gadhada III.7, Gadhada III.10, Sarangpur 9 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . This is possible by earning the grace of Parabrahman and Aksharbrahman through ekantik dharma. In this highest state, the jiva or ishwar never becomes Aksharbrahman but transcends maya and experiences God\u2019s bliss through eternally serving Parabrahman. In BAPS, followers point to Swaminarayan\u2019s teachings in the Vachanamrut and other scriptures emphasizing the role of God manifest through the Aksharbrahman guru to attain moksha. The Swaminarayan Gadi believes that moksha can be attained through the lineage of gurus beginning with Gopalanand Swami. The Narnarayan and Laxminarayan Gadis believe moksha is attained by worshiping the sacred images of Swaminarayan installed by acharyas. == Practices == According to Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died in 1830 the movement had 1.8 million followers, which, by 2001, had grown to an estimated 5 million followers. Lay followers of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya are known as satsangis and are expected to maintain integrity in their actions while avoiding meat, intoxicants, theft, gambling, and adultery. The practices Swaminarayan prescribed were in part consistent with \"Vaishnava and Krishnite traditions.\" Shruti Patel argues that such a consistency with existing practices would have aided in \"sanctioning [the] novelty\" of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. ===Ekantik dharma=== alt=Ekantik dharma (ek\u0101ntik dharma) is an important spiritual practice of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, and its establishment is one of the reasons why Swaminarayan is believed to have incarnated. Ekantik dharma consists of dharma, gnan, vairagya, and bhakti. See Sarangpur 11, Gadhada II.21, and Gadhada III.21 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Dharma consists of religious and moral duties according to one\u2019s responsibilities and situation. All Swaminarayan Hindus who are householders maintain five basic vows: abstaining from theft, gambling, adultery, meat, and intoxicants like alcohol. As part of their dharma, swamis additionally endeavor to perfect the five virtues of non-lust (nishkam/ni\u1e63k\u0101ma), non-greed (nirlobh/nirlobha), non-attachment (nissneh/nissneha), non-taste (niswad/nissvada), and non-ego (nirman/nirm\u0101na). Another aspect of the practice of dharma is the Swaminarayan diet, a type of vegetarianism, similar to that practiced generally by Vaishnava sampradayas, that entails abstaining from animal flesh, eggs, onions, and garlic. Gnan is knowledge of Parabrahman and realizing oneself as the atman. Basic practices of gnan include the daily study of scriptures like the Vachanamrut and Shikshapatri and weekly participation in congregational worship services (sabha/sabh\u0101) at the mandir (temple), in which scriptural discourses geared towards personal and spiritual growth occur. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan explains that adhering to the Aksharbrahman Guru\u2019s commands is commensurate to perfectly embodying gnan\u2014that is, realizing oneself as the atman.See Gadhada II.51 Vairagya is dispassion for worldly objects, through practices like fasting on Ekadashi days, two of which occur every month, and observing extra fasts, during the holy months of Chaturmas (a period of four months between July and October) Vairagya is realized by adhering to the codes of conduct, inclusive of these practices, serving other devotees physically, listening to discourses, and engaging in devotion.See Gadhada III.34 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Bhakti involves devotion towards God, while understanding God\u2019s greatness and believing oneself\u2014the atman\u2014as one with Aksharbrahman.See Panchala 9 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015). The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan. (3rd ed.) Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha . Important bhakti rituals for Swaminarayan Hindus include puja (p\u016bj\u0101; personal worship of God), arti (\u0101rt\u012b; the ritual waving of lighted wicks around murtis, or images), thal (th\u0101l; the offering of food to murtis of God), and cheshta (ce\u1e63t\u0101; the singing of devotional songs that celebrate the divine acts and form of Swaminarayan). During puja, adherents ritually worship Swaminarayan, and depending on their denominational affiliation, also the lineage of gurus through whom Swaminarayan is believed to be manifest. At the beginning of the puja ritual, men imprint a symbol known as the tilak chandlo on their forehead, and women imprint a chandlo. The tilak which is a u-shaped saffron-colored symbol made of sandalwood, symbolizing God's feet, and the chandlo is a red symbol made of kumkum, symbolizing God\u2019s ideal devotee. Other bhakti rituals included in Swaminarayan religious practice are abhishek (abhi\u015beka), the bathing of a murti of God, mahapuja (m\u0101h\u0101p\u016bj\u0101), a collective worship of God usually performed on auspicious days or festivals, and mansi (m\u0101nsi) puja, worship of God offered mentally. == Mandir tradition == Harikrishna Maharaj - Vadtal The Swaminarayan Sampradaya is well-known for its mandirs, or Hindu places of worship. From Swaminarayan\u2019s time through the present, mandirs functioned as centers of worship and gathering as well as hubs for cultural and theological education.Kim, Hanna H., \"Public Engagement and Personal Desires: BAPS Swaminarayan Temples and their Contribution to the Discourses on Religion\" (2010). Anthropology Faculty Publications. They can vary in consecration rituals and architecture, which can be adapted to the means of the local congregation. === History === Swaminarayan instituted the mandir tradition of the sampradaya to provide followers a space for devotional worship (upasana, up\u0101san\u0101) to God. He constructed six mandirs in the following locations: Ahmedabad (1822), Bhuj (1823), Vadtal (1824), Dholera (1826), Junagadh (1828), and Gadhada (1828). Swaminarayan installed the murtis, or sacred images, of various manifestations of God and his devotee in the central shrines of each of these mandirs. He also installed his own image in the form of Harikrishna in the mandir at Vadtal, signifying his own divinity. Swaminarayan\u2019s successors have continued the tradition of installing murtis of God (Swaminarayan) and his ideal devotee to facilitate his followers\u2019 pursuit of moksha. === Murti puja === The Swaminarayan Sampradaya is a bhakti tradition that believes God possesses an eternal, divine, human-like, transcendent form. Thus, Swaminarayan mandirs facilitate devotion to God by housing murtis which are believed to resemble God\u2019s divine form. The murtis are consecrated through the prana pratishta (pr\u0101\u1e45a prati\u1e63\u1e6dha) ceremony, after which God is believed to reside in the murtis. Consequently, the worship practiced in Swaminarayan mandirs is believed to directly reach God. After the consecration of a mandir, various rituals are regularly performed in it. Arti is a ritual which involves singing a devotional song of praise, while waving a flame before the murtis. Arti is performed five times per day in shikharbaddha mandirs and twice per day in hari mandirs. Thal, a ritual offering of food to God accompanied by devotional songs, is also regularly offered three times per day to the murtis in Swaminarayan mandirs. The sanctified food is distributed to devotees after the ritual. Devotees also engage with the murtis in a Swaminarayan mandir through other worship rituals, including darshan, dandvat, and pradakshina. Darshan is the devotional act of viewing the murtis, which are adorned with elegant clothing and ornaments. Dandvats (da\u1e47davat), or prostrations, before the murtis symbolize surrendering to God. Pradakshina (pradak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101), or circumambulations around the murtis, express the desire to keep God at the center of the devotees\u2019 lives. Swaminarayan Akshardham, New Delhi|alt= === Community building and worship === Swaminarayan mandirs also serve as hubs for congregational worship and theological and cultural education. Singing devotional songs, delivering katha (sermons), and performing rituals such as arti all occur daily in Swaminarayan mandirs. In addition, devotees from the surrounding community gather at least once per week, often on a weekend, to perform these activities congregationally. Cultural and theological instruction is also delivered on this day of weekly congregation. Cultural instruction may include Gujarati language instruction; training in music and dance; and preparation for festival performances. Theological instruction includes classes on the tradition\u2019s history and doctrines, and the life and work of the tradition\u2019s gurus. === Types of Swaminarayan mandirs === Swaminarayan followers conduct their worship in various types of mandirs. The homes of Swaminarayan devotees contain ghar mandirs, or home shrines, which serve as spaces for the daily performance of worship and ritual activities such as arti, thal, and reading sermons or scripture. The majority of freestanding public Swaminarayan mandirs are hari mandirs, whose architectural style and consecration rituals are adopted to the means available to the local congregation. As a means of expressing their devotion to Swaminarayan and their guru, some congregations elect to construct stone, shikharbaddha mandirs following Hindu architectural scriptures. In addition to being an expression of devotion, congregants strengthen their sense of community by cooperatively volunteering to construct these mandirs. A fourth type of mandir, called a mahamandiram (mah\u0101mandiram) can be found in India, in New Delhi and Gandhinagar, Gujarat. These mahamandirs are the largest type of mandir constructed and they contain exhibits which present the life of Swaminarayan and the history of Hinduism in various formats with the goal of inspiring introspection and self-improvement. ==Scriptural tradition== alt= In addition to Swaminarayan\u2019s acceptance of perennial Hindu texts such as the four Vedas, Vedanta-sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita, Swaminarayan encouraged the creation of a scriptural tradition specific to the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Along with theological texts with revelatory status, the genres of textual production in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya include sacred biographies, ethical precepts, commentaries, and philosophical treatises. === Vachanamrut === The Vachanamrut, literally the \u2018immortalizing ambrosia in the form of words\u2019, is the fundamental theological text of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya owing to the followers\u2019 belief that Swaminarayan himself is the self- manifestation of Parabrahman. The text is a compilation of 273 discourses, with each discourse within the collection also called a Vachanamrut. Swaminarayan delivered these discourses in Gujarati between the years of 1819-1829, and his senior disciples noted his teachings while they were delivered and compiled them during Swaminarayan\u2019s lifetime. In this scripture, Swaminarayan outlines his system of metaphysics which includes five eternal entities: jiva, ishwar, maya, Aksharbrahman, Parabrahman. He also describes the ultimate goal of life, moksha (mok\u1e63a), a spiritual state of ultimate liberation from the cycle of births and deaths and characterized by eternal bliss and devotion to God. To attain this state, Swaminarayan states that the jiva needs to follow the four-fold practice of ekantik dharmaSee Sarangpur 11 under the guidance of the Aksharbrahman Guru to transcend mayaSee Gadhada III-39 and become brahmarup to reside in the service of God. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be God, the Vachanamrut is considered a direct revelation of God and thus the most precise interpretation of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and other important Hindu scriptures. This scripture is read by followers regularly and discourses are conducted daily in Swaminarayan temples around the world.An illustration of Swaminarayan writing the Shiskhapatri === Shikshapatri === The Shikshapatri is a composition of 212 Sanskrit verses believed to be authored by Swaminarayan and completed in 1826. As an \u2018epistle of precepts,\u2019 the verses primarily communicate the Swaminarayan Sampradaya\u2019s moral injunctions for devotees which should be read daily.See Gadhada III I-14 Sahaj\u0101nanda, Swami (2015), The Vachan\u0101mrut: spiritual discourses of Bhagw\u0101n Sw\u0101min\u0101r\u0101yan (3rd ed.). Ahmedabad: Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha Swaminarayan states that the Shikshapatri is not merely his words but his personified form and merits worship in its own right. === Swamini Vato === The Swamini Vato is a compilation of teachings delivered by Gunatitanand Swami over the course of his forty-year ministry, He was one of Swaminarayan\u2019s foremost disciple, and according to some denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, he was the first manifestation of Swaminarayan in a lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus. Similarly to the Vachanamrut, Gunatitanand Swami\u2019s followers recorded his teachings, which were compiled in his lifetime and reviewed by Gunatitanand Swami himself. These teachings were first published by Balmukund Swami in 5 chapters and then 7 chapters by Krishnaji Ada.https://www.baps.org/Spiritual-Living/Scriptures/Central-Swaminarayan- Scriptures/Swamini-Vato.aspx The text consists of approximately 1,478 excerpts taken from Gunatitanand Swami\u2019s sermons.Mamtora, Bhakti. The making of a modern scripture: Sv\u0101m\u012bn\u012b V\u0101to and the formation of religious subjectivities in Gujarat. PhD diss., (University of Florida, 2019) In his teachings, he reflects on the nature of human experience and offers thoughts on how one ought to frame the intentions with which they act in this world, while also elaborating on Swaminarayan\u2019s supremacy, the importance of the sadhu, and the means for attaining liberation. Often, Gunatitanand Swami elaborates upon topics or passages from the Vachanamrut, which lends the text to be considered a \u2018natural commentary\u2019 on the Vachanamrut within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. In addition, he often made references to other Hindu texts, parables, and occurrences in daily life in order not only to explain spiritual concepts, but also to provide guidance on how to live them. === Sacred biographies === The Swaminarayan Sampradaya has produced voluminous biographical literature on Swaminarayan. The Satsangi Jivan, a five volume Sanskrit sacred biography of Swaminarayan, consists of 17,627 verses written by Shatananda Muni that also incorporates some of Swaminarayan\u2019s teachings. According to Peter Schreiner, it is one of the \u201coldest and most authentic sources on the life\u201d of Swaminarayan. The Bhaktachintamani is a sacred biography of Swaminarayan composed by Nishkulanand Swami. Consisting of 8,536 couplets, this biography serves as a record of Swaminarayan\u2019s life and teachings. The Harililamrut is a longer biographical text in verse written by Dalpatram and published in 1907. The Harilila Kalpataru a 33,000-verse Sanskrit biographical text, was written by Achintyanand Brahmachari, at the suggestion of Gunatitanand Swami. These and many other sacred biographies complement the theological texts, insofar as their incidents serve as practical applications of the theology. === Vedanta commentaries === 200x200px From its early history, the Swaminarayan Sampradaya has also been involved in the practice of producing Sanskrit commentarial work as a way of engaging with the broader scholastic community. The classical Vedanta school of philosophy and theology is of particular import for the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, which has produced exegetical work on the three canonical Vedanta texts\u2014the Upanishads, Brahmasutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. While Swaminarayan himself did not author a commentary on these texts, he engaged with them and their interpretations in the Vachanamrut. Since Swaminarayan\u2019s metaphysical framework consists of five eternal entities, it differs from Ramanuja\u2019s and that of the other commentators, and therefore forms a distinct system within the Vedanta school, known as the Akshar- Purushottam Darshan. The earliest Vedanta commentarial literature in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya reflects a heavy dependence on the Vedanta systems of Ramanuja and Vallabha. Although authorship of these nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century texts are attributed to two of Swaminarayan\u2019s eminent disciples, Muktanand Swami and Gopalanand Swami, textual evidence indicates that they were composed by Vishishtadvaita scholars from southern India, who were called to Gujarat to head the Vadtal Sanskrit Pathshala. The most comprehensive commentarial work on Vedanta in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya is the Swaminarayan Bhashyam authored by Bhadreshdas Swami, an ordained monk of BAPS. It is a five-volume work written in Sanskrit and published between 2009 and 2012. The format and style of exegesis and argument conform with the classical tradition of Vedanta commentarial writing. In more than two thousand pages, the commentator Bhadreshdas Swami, offers detailed interpretations of the principal ten Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahmasutras (Vedanta Sutras) that articulate Swaminarayan\u2019s theology and philosophy. The Shri Kashi Vidvat Parishad, a highly eminent scholarly council for adjudicating matters of Vedic studies and tradition throughout India, stated in a meeting in Varanasi on 31 July 2017 that \"Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dy\u0101ya Sadhu Bhadreshdas is an \u0101c\u0101rya and a contemporary commentator in the lineage of commentators on the Prasth\u0101natray\u012b.\" They also stated that it is \"appropriate to identify Sri Sv\u0101min\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s Ved\u0101nta by the title: Ak\u1e63arapuru\u1e63ottama Dar\u015bana,\" and that his teachings are \"distinct from Advaita, Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita, and all other doctrines.\" Akshar-Purushottam Darshan was also recognised as a distinct school of Vedanta in 2018, by members of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference. Paramtattvadas Swami describes Swaminarayan's teachings as \"a distinct school of thought within the larger expanse of classical Vedanta,\" presenting Swaminarayan's teachings as a seventh school of Vedanta. == Major branches == Swaminarayan temple Ahmedabad 1866 In the 20th century, due to \"different interpretations of authentic successorship,\" the sampradaya split-up into various denominations. All groups regard Swaminarayan as God but differ in their theology and the religious leadership they accept. In the early years of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan personally directed control of the spiritual and administrative duties. Swaminarayan later delegated responsibilities amongst swamis, householders, and the members of his family. In the Lekh, Swaminarayan established two \"administrative dioceses,\" the Vadtal diocese (Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi) and Ahmedabad diocese (Nar Narayan Dev Gadi), and appointed two acharyas to \"administer his temple properties\" which are distributed among them, establishing a hereditary line of succession. The first acharyas of the two dioceses were Swaminarayan's two nephews, Raghuvir (Vadtal) and Ayodhyaprasad (Ahmedabad), whose descendants continue the hereditary line of succesion. According to a number of traditions, Swaminarayan introduced a spiritual lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus through which he manifests. BAPS adherents believe Swaminarayan introduced Gunatitanand Swami as his ideal devotee, from which a spiritual lineage of gurus began, reflecting the principle that a form of God who lives \u201cbefore one\u2019s eyes\u201d is necessary for aspirants to attain moksha (liberation). Swaminarayan Gadi adherents believe a spiritual succession begins from a lineage starting with Gopalanand Swami. === Laxminarayan Gadi (Vadtal) and Narnarayan Gadi (Ahmedabad) === Per the Lekh, Swaminarayan appointed two of his nephews as acharyas to administer the two gadis, or dioceses. Ayodhyaprasadji, son of his elder brother Rampratap, became acharya of the Nar Narayan Dev Gadi (Ahmedabad diocese), and Raghuvirji, son of his younger brother Ichcharam, became acharya of the Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi (Vadtal diocese). In the twentieth century, several controversies involving the acharyas led to litigation resulting in restrictions on the acharyas\u2019 authority along with schisms and the formation of new subgroups within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. The current acharya of the Nar Narayan Dev Gadi is Koshalendraprasad Pande. There is currently an active case regarding the Vadtal Gadi centered around a factional dispute between Dev paksh, the faction led by Rakeshprasad Pande, and Siddhant paksh, which is led by Ajendraprasad Pande. Gujarat high court has stayed the Nadiad court order removing Ajendraprasad until a final verdict is reached. He is restrained from enjoying the rights of acharya during the proceedings. Dev paksh, governing the Vadtal temple trust, has appointed Rakeshprasad to act and officiate as acharya. Siddhant paksh believes Ajendraprasad is the current acharya and welcome his son, Nrigendraprasad, to officiate at functions in Swaminarayan temples in his absence. Mahant Swami Maharaj, current guru and president of BAPS === Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) === The Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) was formed in 1907, by Shastriji Maharaj (Shastri Yagnapurushdas). Shastriji Maharaj's primary reason for separation from the Vadtal diocese and creation of BAPS had been due to doctrinal differences in the interpretation of Akshar (Aksharbrahma) and Purushottam. As articulated in the theology of Akshar- Purushottam Darshan, followers believe Swaminarayan manifests through a lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus beginning with Gunatitanand Swami and currently Mahant Swami Maharaj. === Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) === The Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) was founded in the 1940s by Muktajivandas Swami after he left the Ahmedabad diocese with the belief that Gopalanand Swami, a paramhansa from Swaminarayan's time, was the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan. On 9 July 2020, Jitendrapriyadasji Swami was appointed as the spiritual leader. Followers of the Swaminarayan Gadi accept the Rahasyarth Pradeepika Tika, a five-volume work written by Abji Bapa, as an authentic exegesis of the Vachanamrut. === Gunatit Samaj === The Yogi Divine Society (YDS) was established in 1966, by Dadubhai Patel and his brother, Babubhai after they were excommunicated from BAPS by Yogiji Maharaj. The brothers were expelled after it was discovered that Dadubhai illicitly collected and misappropriated funds and, falsely claiming that he was acting on the organization\u2019s behalf, led a number of young women to renounce their families and join his ashram under his leadership.Swaminarayan Prakash. June 1966. Mumbai (Dadar): Akshar Bhavan. After Dadubhai\u2019s death in 1986, an ascetic named Hariprasad Swami became the leader of the Yogi Divine Society. Yogi Divine Society became known as the Gunatit Samaj and consists of several wings: namely, YDS, The Anoopam Mission, and The Gunatit Jyot. == Influence on society == === Humanitarian Service === In addition to his efforts in social reform, Swaminarayan was instrumental in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Gujarat during turbulent times of famine. When given the opportunity to receive two boons from his guru, Swaminarayan asked to receive any miseries destined for followers and to bear any scarcities of food or clothing in place of any followers. In the initial years of the sampradaya, Swaminaryan maintained almshouses throughout Gujarat and directed swamis to maintain the almshouses even under the threat of physical injury by opponents. During a particularly harsh famine in 1813-14, Swaminarayan himself collected and distributed grains to those who were suffering, and he had step wells and water reservoirs dug in various villages. He codified devotees\u2019 engagement with humanitarian service in the Shikshapatri, instructing followers to help the poor and those in need during natural disasters, to establish schools, and to serve the ill, according to their ability. Consequently, various denominations of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya currently engage in humanitarian service at a global scale. For example, BAPS has been involved with coordinating responses to major natural disasters, building various residential and day schools, organizing blood donation drives and free medical clinics as well as constructing and running seven hospitals and treatment centers through its humanitarian services wing, BAPS Charities. Following the devastating earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, they rebuilt 15 villages and neighborhoods and 39 schools. For its work, BAPS has been granted consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. ISSO Seva, a subsidiary of the Ahmedabad diocese, is involved in disaster relief, food and blood donation drives in the United States and providing accessible healthcare in Africa. The Gunatit Samaj also hosts medical camps, provides educational services, healthcare, and other social services in India. The Swaminarayan Gadi (Maninagar) diocese primarily hosts health camps and other social services in the UK, Africa and North America. SVG Charity, a subsidiary of the Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi, is involved in disaster relief, food and medicine donations, blood drives, and organ donation registration drives across the United States, Europe, Canada, and India. === Caste === During Swaminarayan\u2019s time, the oppressive nature of caste-based customs, like endogamy, dress codes, and commensality, pervaded many aspects of society. Religious groups and other institutions often regulated membership based on caste. Swaminarayan opposed caste-based discrimination and has been credited as one of the foremost social reformers of 19th century India for his efforts in reducing caste-based oppression. In fact, Swaminarayan\u2019s opposition of caste-based discrimination through his spiritual teachings and practices incited vehement criticism and violence from some high-caste Hindus. Kishore Mashruwala, a Gandhian scholar writes that \u201cSwaminarayan was the first to bring about religious advancement of Shudras in Gujarat and Kathiawad region\u2026And that became the main reason for many to oppose the Sampraday\u201d. It is noted in an 1823 memorandum published in The Asiatic Journal that upper-caste Hindus \u201cregret the levelling nature of [Swaminarayan's] system\u201d often resulting in frequent violence against followers of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Swaminarayan's doctrine that everyone's true self is the pure atma within which God resides, led him to reject caste-based discrimination and welcome those of all caste backgrounds equally into the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. In his public writings, Swaminarayan allowed for some caste rules to protect his followers from violence incited by his opposition of caste-based discrimination. For example, in the Shikshapatri, Swaminarayan states that his followers should follow rules of the caste system when consuming food and water. Based on these public writings some have criticized Swaminarayan of supporting caste-based discrimination. However, numerous scholars have demonstrated that this criticism is unfounded, citing Swaminarayan\u2019s continued actions in combating caste-based oppression and promoting inclusivity. In fact, Swaminarayan not only accepted people from all castes into the sampradaya but also Muslims and tribal peoples. Additionally, various historical sources indicate that Swaminarayan himself often ignored caste rules and urged his followers to do the same. When asked about his views on caste by Bishop Reginald Heber, Swaminarayan stated that he did not believe in the caste system but sometimes accommodated it publicly so as to not offend the masses. Taken together, Swaminarayan\u2019s contemporaries and modern scholars both credit him for reducing caste-based oppression and discrimination through his actions and teachings. Swaminarayan\u2019s actions uplifted many of the oppressed and drew them to the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Williams, Raymond Brady (2018).
