It is thought that the Indians moved their village down to the creek's banks in the summer and retreated up the ravine in the winter. They lived in log houses and operated a trading post. When the White Settlers arrived, the Indians living there were probably neither Miami or Wyandott, but instead were most likely Potawatomi. In 1849, a post office was established in Wyandot, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1872. ==Geography== Wyandot is located at with an elevation of 659 feet. A few buildings in the community still exist, and it is still cited by the USGS. == Richardville Indian Reserve == The Richardville Indian Reserve was located in Sheffield Township and was one of six Reserves located in Tippecanoe County.
