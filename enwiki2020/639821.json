    "text": "The School of General Studies, Columbia University (GS) is a liberal arts college and one of the undergraduate colleges of Columbia University, situated on the university's main campus in Morningside Heights, New York City.http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/columbia- university-2707 GS is known primarily for its traditional B.A. degree program for non-traditional students, such as those who have had an academic break of at least one year or are pursuing dual-degrees. GS students make up almost 30% of the Columbia undergraduate population (including Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and GS). GS offers dual-degree programs with several leading universities around the world. It offers dual degrees with List College of the Jewish Theological Seminary, Sciences Po in France, Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, Tel Aviv University in Israel, and City University of Hong Kong. It also offers the BA/MA Option with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Combined Plan and the MS Express program with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and five-year joint degrees with the School of International and Public Affairs. GS offers the Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program, the oldest and largest program of its kind in the United States. Notable alumni include Nobel Prize winners Simon Kuznets, Baruj Benacerraf, and Louise Gl\u00fcck, as well as Isaac Asimov, J.D. Salinger, Amelia Earhart, and Princess Firyal of Jordan. ==History== Lewisohn Hall at Columbia University, home to the School of General Studies ===Predecessor institutions=== GS's evolutionary ancestor is the now-defunct, all-male Seth Low College, named for former Brooklyn mayor and President of Columbia Seth Low. It was established in Downtown Brooklyn in 1928 to help alleviate the flood of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The entrance requirements for Seth Low Junior College were reportedly the same as those enforced in Columbia College.Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume LI, Number 119, 3 April 1928 Following completion of the two-year program, graduates could complete their undergraduate degrees at the University's professional schools, such as the School of Law, Business School, or School of Engineering and Applied Science (all of which conferred terminal bachelor's degrees at the time) or earn B.S. degrees in the liberal arts as University Undergraduates. Seth Low Junior College was closed in 1938 due to the adverse economic effects of the Great Depression and concomitant popularity of the tuition-free Brooklyn College in 1930. Henceforth, its remaining students were absorbed into the Morningside Heights campus as students in the University Undergraduate program, which was established by Nicholas Murray Butler in 1904. University Extension was responsible for the founding of the Columbia Business School, the School of General Studies and the School of Dental and Oral Surgery (now the College of Dental Medicine). The School of Continuing Education (now the School of Professional Studies), a separate school, was later established to reprise University Extension's former role.http://library-archives.cumc.columbia.edu/finding-aid/college-dental- medicine-school-dental-oral-surgery-records-1892-1915-1976 ===The Establishment of the School of General Studies=== With an influx of students attending the University on the GI Bill following the resolution of World War II, in December 1946, the University Undergraduate program was reorganized as an official undergraduate college for \"qualified students who, because of employment or for other reasons, are unable to attend other schools of the University.\" Columbia University pioneered the use of the term \"General Studies\" when naming the college, adapting the medieval term for universities, \"Studium Generale.\" Thus, the School of General Studies bears no semblance to general studies or extension studies programs at other universities in the United States. In December 1968, the University Council permitted GS to grant the B.A. degree instead of the B.S. degree, making it only one of two colleges at Columbia offering the B.A. degree. ===Merging of Columbia College and School of General Studies Faculties=== In 1991, the Columbia College (CC), School of General Studies (GS), and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) faculties were merged into the Faculty of Arts & Sciences, which resulted in the complete academic integration between the School of General Studies and Columbia College.http://fas.columbia.edu/home/about-faculty-arts- and-sciences/historyhttp://columbiaspectator.com/2014/02/26/gs-eliminate-bs- degree-option-may-2014 As a result, both GS and CC students receive B.A. degrees conferred by the Trustees of Columbia University through the Faculty of Art & Sciences, and GS is recognized as an official liberal arts college at Columbia University. == Academics == GS students make up almost 30% of the Columbia undergraduate population and in 2013 were reported as consistently collectively earning the highest average GPA among undergraduates at Columbia University.https://s3.amazonaws.com/BWARCHIVE/2013/may13.pdfhttp://bwog.com/2013/05/18/paying- it-forward-student-debt-at-gs/ Approximately 20% of GS students are part-time students who have significant, full-time work commitments in addition to their academic responsibilities.https://gs.columbia.edu/program-overview Numerous GS students have gone on to win prestigious fellowships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and the Fulbright Scholarship. The School of General Studies confers the degree of Bachelor of Arts in more than 70 majors. All GS students are required to complete the Core Curriculum, which includes University Writing, Literature/Humanities, Contemporary Civilization/Social Science, Art Humanities, Music Humanities, Global Core, Quantitative Reasoning, Science, and Foreign Language. GS offers dual degree programs with Sciences Po, the City University of Hong Kong, Trinity College Dublin (University of Dublin) in Ireland, and List College of the Jewish Theological Seminary.http://gs.columbia.eduhttps://gs.columbia.edu/sciences- po/glance It also offers dual degree programs with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of International and Public Affairs, and Columbia Business School. GS has a Post-baccalaureate Premedical Program, the oldest program of its kind.https://gs.columbia.edu/sciences-po/glance ==Admission== Admission to Columbia GS is highly competitive, with the estimated acceptance rate of 33-35%,Petersons GS Profile and it requires an online application, official high school (or GED) transcripts, SAT or ACT test scores within the past eight years or a score on the General Studies Admissions Examination, an essay of 1,500-2,000 words, and two recommendation letters.http://gs.columbia.edu/applying-gs Interviews are conducted in person and over phone. ===Eligibility=== Prospective Columbia undergraduates who have had a break of a year or more in their education, have already completed an undergraduate degree (and intend to pursue studies in a different discipline), or are pursuing dual undergraduate degrees are considered non-traditional and eligible to apply to GS. Applicants in extenuating circumstances which preclude them from attending Columbia College full-time are also eligible.http://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/ask/faq?body_value=general+studies&field;_question_topics_tid=Allhttp://columbiaspectator.com/2012/03/07/gsjts- students-feel-caught-between-two-worlds GS students have the option to attend part- or full-time. ==Dual degree programs== ===Joint Program with the Jewish Theological Seminary \u2013 Albert A. List College=== Since 1954, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) and the School of General Studies have offered a joint degree program leading to a B.A. from Columbia University and a B.A. from List College. Professor Lisa Rosen-Metsch, Dean of the School of General Studies, is an alumna of the Joint Program. ===Dual BA with Sciences Po Paris=== The Dual BA Program is a unique program in which undergraduate students earn two Bachelor of Arts degrees in four years from both Columbia University and Sciences Po, one of the most prestigious universities in France and Europe.http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/studying-in- france/presentation-1988/articles-from-actualites-en-france/article/elite- paris-institut-d-etudes This program is geared towards traditionally-aged applicants in high school, and is one of the most selective undergraduate programs in the nation.https://gs.columbia.edu/sciences-po/faq Students spend two years at one of three Sciences Po campuses in France (Le Havre, Menton, or Reims), each of which is devoted to a particular region of the world.
