It is close to the England\u2013Wales border and is one of a number of English villages to have a Welsh language placename. The first part of the name of the village comes from the Middle English word bedhus, meaning \"prayer house\", which became betws in Welsh.Welsh Place Names Dictionary Betws-y-Crwyn translates roughly as \"chapel of the fleeces\". The parish name was formerly written simply as Bettws, and the suffix, probably a local name for the church, only appears in written records in the nineteenth century.Gelling and Foxall, The place-names of Shropshire, v.1, English Place- Name Society, 1990, p.47 The parish, including the hamlets of Anchor (which has a pub of the same name), Quabbs and Hall of the Forest had a total population of 212 at the 2001 census,Bettws-y-Crwyn CP, Office for National Statistics increasing to 239 at the 2011 census. It lies at above sea level, making it one of the highest settlements in Shropshire and England too. The village is about west of the Shropshire town of Craven Arms, and only about south-east of Newtown in Powys, Wales. Bettws had a school which closed in 1951; its building is now the village hall, containing a First World War memorial board. The parish lies within the Clun electoral division of Shropshire Council. ==Church== The church The church of St. Mary dates from the late 13th or early 14th century, and was \"restored\" in 1860. There is a fine 15th or 16th century screen and roof, a 17th-century pulpit, and 19th century pews, with the names of farms within the parish painted on them.St Mary, Bettwys-y-crwyn, British Listed Buildings The church contains a ceramic war memorial plaque to men who died serving in World War I.
