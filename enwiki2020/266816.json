    "text": "Vashon is a census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. It covers an island alternately called Vashon Island or Vashon-Maury Island, the largest island in Puget Sound south of Admiralty Inlet. The population was 10,624 at the 2010 census and the size is . The island is connected to West Seattle and the Kitsap Peninsula to the north and Tacoma to the south via the Washington State Ferries system, as well as to Downtown Seattle via the King County Water Taxi. The island has resisted the construction of a fixed bridge to preserve its relative isolation and rural character. Vashon Island is also known for its annual strawberry festival, sheepdog trials, and agriculture. ==History== Vashon Island sits in the midpoint of southern Puget Sound, between Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. The island lies along the fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which last saw a major rupture in 1700, but the potential of the zone could cause one of the worst natural disasters in the history of North America. === Native American inhabitants === Up until the late 1700s, Vashon and Maury Islands were inhabited solely by American Indians, and there is evidence of human activity on Vashon Island dating back 10,000 to 12,000 years. Historical data from the era when the first Native Americans settled Vashon\u2013Maury Island is limited. Some of the Native peoples known to have lived on Vashon Island were the Marpole culture from about 7,000 years ago, the Salish about 1,000 years ago, and the S'Homamish starting about 500 years ago, the latter of which established 5 known major village sites. The Tulalip Indians is another tribe that populated the villages along the shores of both islands.https://historylink.org/File/8852 Fishing was abundant in the cold saltwater of the central Puget Sound basin, helping Native American tribes to thrive. Moreover, the many waterways and inlets provided easy travel by way of canoe. ===Euramerican settlement=== The first non\u2013American Indian to explore and the first to chart this island was Captain George Vancouver, during his surveys of the Puget Sound area with the British Royal Navy. The island was named on May 28, 1792, by Vancouver after his friend James Vashon of the Royal Navy. Starting in 1824, different explorer and settler groups stayed on Vashon Island. Maury Island, immediately to the southeast of Vashon, was named in 1841 by then Lt. Charles Wilkes in honor of William Lewis Maury, an officer in the United States Exploring Expedition.http://vashonhistory.com/Vashon%20History/place_name.htm#M Maury was naturally separated from Vashon by a narrow passage, until local landowners decided to build an earth bridge, or isthmus, linking them together in 1916, thus creating the hamlet of Portage. Therefore, the two-piece isle was renamed Vashon-Maury Island. Between the two sections, it covers nearly . The first logging on the island began in 1852. By 1855\u20131856, the S'Homamish people were interned at Fox Island. European-Americans settled Vashon Island between 1865 and 1890. During that time the main economies on the island were fishing and logging. In 1890, Japanese Americans started growing strawberries for sale. Denichiro Mukai came to the island in 1910 and became renowned for barreling fresh strawberries using a special method that concentrated flavor and moisture in the fruit and permitted long distance shipping. In time, Mukai designed and built his own home and elaborate garden and then constructed a sturdy timber framed barreling plant. During the peak years, ice cream, jam and preserve makers across the West were customers of Mukai, relishing the oak barrels for their lingering flavor and mythologizing about the island of strawberry fields. This became an important part of the island economy during the next 50 years, until the Japanese American population was forcibly relocated into internment camps as a response to Japanese/American tension caused by WWII. In 1892, Vashon College opened in the Burton section of Vashon. During its operation, it was one of the leading colleges in the area. It burned down in 1910.https://tacomahistory.live/2017/05/01/strawberry- fields-forever/ == Geography == Vashon Island from Point Defiance Park According to the United States Census Bureau, the Vashon CDP has a total area of , of which comprise the island and are the waters of Puget Sound surrounding the island. To the west Vashon Island is separated from the Kitsap Peninsula by the Colvos Passage. The Dalco Passage separates Vashon Island from Tacoma to the south. Neighborhoods of Vashon Island include Magnolia Beach, which had a post office from 1908 to 1953, and Raeco, with a post office from 1907 to 1911. ===Climate=== This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Vashon has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Vashon, Washington == Demographics == As of the census of 2000, there were 10,123 people, 4,193 households, and 2,838 families residing in the CDP.

The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.86. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.2% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 34.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

Based on per capita income, Vashon ranks 32nd of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. == Government == In 1994 the Vashon Island Committee for Self-Government circulated a petition calling for the incorporation of Vashon and Maury Islands. At the time only some 448 residents of about 10,000 signed the petition which was then filed with the King County Auditor. The Vashon-Maury Island Community Council was a body whose purpose was to advise the King County Council on matters relating to Vashon Island and Maury Island. In 2013, it collapsed due to a requirement that it comply with the state's public records act and threats of lawsuits undermined the function of the organization. However, with the adoption of formal bylaws on June 15, 2020 a new Vashon-Maury Island Community Council was officially created by island residents. The new group was formed as a non-profit to help island residents address important issues facing their community. == Public safety == Vashon Fire is led by Chief Charlie Krimmert and is a combination professional- volunteer department. Station 55 (main station) also houses one King County Medic One unit - Medic 9 for ALS emergency response and transportation. In June 2018 the Washington Surveying and Rating Bureau (WSRB) downgraded the fire protection rating of some areas of Vashon Island due to the number of district volunteers and where they live, as the department has no firefighters that respond from Station 59 (Vashon Heights) and only one who responds from Station 58 (Dockton.) The island has an established emergency operations center manager who runs emergency drills with members of the community emergency response team (CERT) in order to provide the best response in times of emergencies such as earthquakes. The drills were established as routine through the group VashonBePrepared, a nonprofit, FEMA-sanctioned coalition of disaster preparedness organizations that were previously established on the island. Sometimes the drills have members of the Washington Army National Guard participating and supporting the volunteers. === Crime === According to Neighborhoodscout, Vashon Island is safer than 31% of United States cities. There are some claims that the island is home to various \"drug houses\", a claim which has caused the Vashon Youth & Family Services to offer substance abuse counseling as part of the regular assembly of social services. Homicide rates on the island are extremely low, with only two homicides reported in the last twenty years and other forms of crime are also largely not seen. In 2005 the Sheriff's Office investigated one rape, six assaults, and forty-nine burglaries, in 2006 they investigated three rapes, eight assaults, and sixty- three burglaries. Major crimes on the Island include a serial rapist who operated from 2003 through 2010 until he was arrested and charged due to DNA evidence, and an police officer who plead guilty to incest and other sex crimes involving his underage stepdaughter. == Economy == The economy of Vashon Island is heavily based on residents commuting to Seattle and Tacoma. Uptown Vashon === Agriculture === While orchards and strawberry farms formerly played a major role in the Vashon economy, the pressures of suburban residential development have all but eliminated any major commercial agriculture on the island. Many small farms operate on the island, providing locals with fresh organic produce, milk, and eggs. Despite the changes, the island continues to observe the tradition of holding a Strawberry Festival every July. In certain areas like Dockton, a significant amount of private property was occupied and subsequently seized from Japanese-American citizens who farmed strawberries on that land until World War II, when they were moved to internment camps away from the island. Local orchards and wineries are established on the island, with some focusing on developing perry, an alcoholic beverage derived from pear juice instead of grapes. There are at least three wineries that produce 100% locally produced wines and other alcoholic-based beverages. === Manufacturing and industry === Vashon has lost two of its major industrial employers: K2 Sports moved its manufacturing to China, and the Seattle's Best Coffee roastery operation was closed shortly after SBC was bought by Starbucks. Currently, the largest manufacturer on Vashon is Pacific Research Laboratories, locally referred to as \"The Bone Factory\". In 2014 it was reported that the company Edipure was to purchase the old K2 ski plant to manufacture more than 60 marijuana-based snacks including crackers, candy and gummy bears. ==Infrastructure== === Transportation === There are no bridges to Vashon Island, so all access to the island is by sea or by air. Most travel on and off the island is on the Washington State Ferry system. A bridge connecting Vashon to Seattle and Kitsap County was planned in 1959, but was ultimately not funded. A second bridge proposal from the Washington State Transportation Commission was withdrawn in 1992 after objections from island residents. Vashon Municipal Airport is on the northern half of the island. There is no regularly scheduled air service to the airport. King County Metro provides bus service down the length of the island daily. During peak commute times on weekdays, the buses drive on to the ferry to Seattle.https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/schedules- maps/118-119.aspx#weekday On September 10, 2016, on-island Sunday service returned to Vashon. Route 118 provides islanders with Sunday service for the first time in many years, mirroring Saturday schedules and helping riders connect with both ferry terminals and other destinations in between.Detailed map of Vashon Island, Washington ==== Ferries ==== The southern terminus of the Vashon Highway is the Tahlequah Ferry Terminal in the Tahlequah neighborhood, connected to the Point Defiance neighborhood of Tacoma by the Point Defiance\u2013Tahlequah ferry. The northern terminus of the Vashon Highway is the Heights Dock at Point Vashon, serving the state ferry docks at Southworth, and Fauntleroy in West Seattle. Passenger-only service from Heights Dock to Colman Dock in Downtown Seattle is provided by the King County Ferry District, with three sailings in each direction during the morning and afternoon, Monday through Friday.Water Taxi === Health care === In 2016 it was reported that the medical clinic on the island had closed after CHI Franciscan Health had left the clinic, claiming financial concerns. Another provider, the non-profit Neighborcare Health, pledged to open a new clinic later in the year, alleviating the issue of transporting patients to hospitals off the island via the ferry, which can take upwards of three hours. ==== Vaccination concerns ==== Many of those who live on the island choose not to vaccinate their children due to personal beliefs and concerns, with more than 98% that don't vaccinate citing \"Personal\" on the paper work instead of \"Religious\" or \"Medical\". The divide between beliefs has caused many arguments and resentment, with at least two separate Facebook pages, one now marked private, to share information and discuss with one another. It was reported in 2015 that 23.1% of kindergartners in the Vashon Island School District legally opted out of vaccinations against diphtheria and tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, and hepatitis B. The number at the time was five times the state average. Due to expanded access to vaccines, media coverage of the measles outbreaks, and education about the benefits of vaccination, the vaccine rate for the Vashon Island School District has risen over the years, even though it is still one of the lowest in the United States. The district's rates of students fully immunized has risen 31% in the past six years, from only 56% to 74% in the 2017-2018 school year, although it is below the 95% target rate for the rest of the country. In 2019 it was reported that some 11.6% of families on the island had chosen not to vaccinate their children, and some claim that those who do not vaccinate their children and their children are excluded from gatherings or openly mocked. ==Education== Public schools: There are three public schools provided by the Vashon Island School District#402:Vashon Island School District website, retrieved 2012-04-02 *Chautauqua Elementary School *McMurray Middle School *Vashon Island High School Private schools: There are two private schools in Vashon. *The Harbor School (grades 4 to 8).Harbor School, retrieved 2012-04-03 65 students were enrolled as of September 2013. *Carpe Diem Primary School (Kindergarten to 3rd grade). 26 students were enrolled as of September 2013. == Arts and culture == The annual studio tour was created in the late 1970s by some of the potters who lived on the island. The group was rebranded in February 2018 as the Vashon Island Visual Artists, and they applied for non- profit status in 2015. The group now operates semi-annual tours of studios of local artists, classes, workshops, salons, exhibits, and social activities for artists, with membership around 300. The island is home to a choral group established in 1989 under the name Island Singers, and now known as the Vashon Island Chorale. == Media == === Broadcast radio stations === In 2014 a small, non-profit media outlet, the Voice of Vashon, acquired a low-power FM radio broadcast license from the FCC. KVSH-FM went live on 101.9 FM in October 2014, and is also available for live streaming. The Voice of Vashon also operates a television station, Comcast Channel 21, and its emergency broadcast system at 1650AM. Each of these outlets serves Vashon and Maury Islands year round, 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, with island-generated or specific information, entertainment and emergency alerts. Maury Island is home to numerous AM transmitters. KIRO 710 (built in 1941) has two massive towers for its 50,000-watt day/night transmitter. KTTH 770, which transmits 50,000 watts during the day and 5,000 watts at night, shares towers with KFNQ. KIRO and KTTH are owned by Bonneville International. There was a tower originally built in 1946 for KEVR 1090AM, which later became KING radio, and is now KFNQ, owned by CBS. It transmits 50,000 watts day/night and operates three towers. This site is shared with KTTH. On Vashon Island, radio station KVI 570 has a single tower on a beach in Tramp Harbor, nicknamed \"KVI Beach\". KVI transmits 24 hours a day at 5,000 watts. KOMO 1000 transmits 50,000 watts day/night and has a three-tower setup on the northeast corner of the island. Both KVI and KOMO are owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. KGNW AM 820 propagates its signal from three towers in the center of the island. It operates 50,000 watts during the day and 5,000 at night. It is owned by Salem Media Group. KJR 950 shares the towers at the KGNW site, transmits 50,000 watts day/night, and is owned by iHeartCommunications, Inc. These stations have located their transmitters on Vashon and Maury Islands because soil conductivity, important to signal propagation in the MW band broadcast frequency range, is greater than elsewhere around Puget Sound. The surrounding sea water is also helpful to MW propagation. == Sports and recreation == The island is home to the Vashon Island Rowing Club and Burton Beach Rowing Club, both of which participate in many events such as the Opening Day celebrations on Seattle's Montlake Cut. The Vashon Sheepdog Classic occurs each year at the Misty Isle Farms, with local food and merchandise vendors, with all profits going to area nonprofits. The trials are completed by a team composed of a dog and its handler who are released into a shedding ring and work to herd the sheep into specific areas. ==Notable people== * Matt Alber, musician * Gene Amondson, Prohibition Party presidential candidate * Gene \"Bean\" Baxter, co-host of KROQ's Kevin and Bean radio morning show * Steve Berlin, of the Grammy Award-winning band Los Lobos * Alex Borstein, actress noted especially for her work on Fox's MADtv and as the voice of Family Guy's Lois Griffin * Berkeley Breathed, author of the political satire comic strip Bloom County, resided on Vashon for some time.
