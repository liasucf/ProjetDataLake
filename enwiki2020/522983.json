    "text": "Red Shoe Diaries is an American anthology erotic drama series that aired on Showtime cable network from 1992 to 1997 and distributed by Playboy Entertainment overseas. It is a spinoff of an earlier film by the same name, also directed by Zalman King. Most episodes were directed by either Zalman King, Rafael Eisenman or both. The story-lines usually have a thin plot revolving around some intrigue and the sexual awakening of a girl or woman who often also narrates. Sensuous love scenes with nudity as well as sultry, moody music are characteristic for most episodes. There is no story arc or characters connecting the different stories other than Jake Winters introducing each episode. ==Synopsis== The tested episodes always open with a quick montage of a newspaper personals section ad under \"Red Shoes\" seeking women to mail in their personal diaries with stories of love, passion and/or betrayal. The presenter and host Jake Winters (David Duchovny) is then shown walking on desolate train tracks with his dog Stella. He begins reading a letter from his post office box out loud that begins with \"Dear Red Shoes...\" He first took out the ad after the suicide of his fianc\u00e9e, and his subsequent confrontation of the man with whom she was having an affair, a construction worker and shoe salesman who sold her a pair of red high heels, inspiring the ad. He placed the ad in the newspaper in an effort to understand why it happened and learn his fianc\u00e9e's reasons for killing herself through the stories of women in similar situations. ==Syndication== Red Shoe Diaries episodes were running on the Canadian television channel Showcase, early Saturday morning, as of August 2010. From time to time, episodes can also be viewed on Showtime. A few episodes can be viewed on Amazon Video or hulu.com. This show is also on Tubi. ==Episodes list== ===Season 1=== #\"Safe Sex\"; Guest Stars: Steven Bauer, Joan Severance, John Toles-Bey #\"Double Dare\"; Guest Stars: Laura Johnson, Scott Lawrence, Sarah Luck Pearson, Arnold Vosloo, Michael Woods #\"You Have the Right to Remain Silent\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Pat Banta, Denise Crosby, Robert Knepper #\"Talk to Me Baby\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Kim Burnette, Lydie Denier, Annabelle Gurwitch, Lynn Speier, Peter Spellos, Richard Tyson #\"Just Like That\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Carl Gilliard, Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, Matt LeBlanc, Victoria Mahoney, Renata Scott, Nina Siemaszko #\"Another Woman's Lipstick\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Maryam d'Abo, \u00c1ngel Ferreira, Christina Fulton, Miranda Garrison, Annabelle Gurwitch, Kevin Haley #\"Auto Erotica\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Nick Chinlund, Caitlin Dulany, Kenny Johnson #\"Jake's Story\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Ely Pouget, William Paul Burns, Angela Cornell, Audie England, Sheryl Lee, Frederick Washburn #\"Accidents Happen\" a.k.a. \"The Fling\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Marina Giulia Cavalli, David Duchovny, Scott Plank, Ally Sheedy #\"The Bounty Hunter\"; Guest Stars: David Duchovny, Ely Pouget, Sue Kiel, Nicholas Love, Ron Marquette, Dee McCafferty, Claire Stansfield #\"Weekend Pass\"; Guest Stars: Anthony Addabbo, Shashawnee Hall, Ely Pouget #\"Double or Nothing\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Paula Barbieri, Francesco Quinn, Lisa Boyle #\"How I Met My Husband\"; Guest Stars: Ely Pouget, Luigi Amodeo, Alex Ardenti, Jennifer Burton, Neith Hunter, Sue Kiel, Andrea Riave, Lucas David Castillo Acosta ===Season 2=== #\"Midnight Bells\"; Guest Stars: Luc Leestemaker, Charlotte Lewis, Carsten Norgaard #\"Naked in the Moonlight\"; Guest Stars: Rudy de Rooy, John Enos III, California Ralph, Raven Snow #\"Runway\"; Guest Stars: Darienne Arnold, Daniel Anibal Blasco, Jennifer Burton, James DeAngelo, Lorna Firman, Krista Heitkamp, Udo Kier, Ena La Van, Tiffany Lawrence, Deborah Lin, Andrea Riave, Amber Smith, Frederick Washburn #\"Kidnap\"; Guest Stars: Randall Boffman, Jennifer Ciesar, Matt LeBlanc, Robert Mailhouse, Ron Marquette, Dee McCafferty, Robert Peters, Hartley Silver #\"Burning Up\"; Guest Stars: Rhonda Aldrich, Ivan Allen, Avalon Anders, Jennifer Burton, Anthony Guidera, Alexandra Tydings, Mark Zuelke #\"Night of Abandon\"; Guest Stars: Catalina Bonakie, Ann Cockburn, Daniel Leza #\"Liar's Tale\"; Guest Stars: Erika Anderson, Audie England, Lorna Firman, Margaret Makinen, Peter Quartaroli, Terrence Sheahan, Paula Venice #\"In the Blink of an Eye\"; Guest Stars: Richard Dieux, Brian Edwards, Julien Maurel, Philippe Nahon, Laurie Simpson, Dominique Valera #\"Hotline\"; Guest Stars: Don Bloomfield, Mar\u00eda Celedonio, Margaret Cho, Audie England, George Pilgrim, Wendy Schaal, Judy Toll #\"Love at First Sight\"; Guest Stars: Anthony Addabbo, Eric James, Denice D.
