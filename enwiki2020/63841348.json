The Society petitioned the King for a charter on 18 April 1769 and the Hibernian Society was incorporated under Royal Charter on 15 July 1769. The first meeting of the Governors was held on 6 November 1769 in Dublin Castle. In 1922 the school and boys moved to Shorncliffe and the buildings were handed over to the newly independent Irish Government. ===Medical use=== The buildings were used as a hospital by the Irish Army. In 1948 it was transferred to the Dublin Health Authority and turned into a Chest Hospital. In 1964 it became a facility for older patients and provides today accommodation for dependent older people. It has 198 residential places. ===COVID-19 pandemic=== During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic patients contracted COVID-19.
