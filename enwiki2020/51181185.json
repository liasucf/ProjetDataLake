    "text": "The Swan 61 was designed by German Frers and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 1985. The Swan 61 is the same hull as the Swan 59, with an extended transom that provided more room for storage aft, especially for a larger tender. Another benefit of the modified design is that the owner's stateroom aft is larger. In total, 14 yachts were built between 1985 and 1990, bringing the total run of the 59/61 series to 35. ==External links== * Nautor Swan * German Frers Official Website ==References== Category:Sailing yachts Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailboat types built by Nautor Swan Category:Sailboat type designs by Germ\u00e1n Frers ",
