    "text": "\"Croire\" (English title: \"Trust\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, performed in French by Belgian singer Lara Fabian, an at the time 18-year-old up and coming artist, and some twenty years later an established performer in all of the world. The song is a ballad, with Fabian singing that she wants to believe in the good of humanity, rather than its dark side. She sings that \"we have love within us\", which is her central belief. Fabian also recorded the song in English and German language versions, as \"Trust\" and \"Glaub'\" respectively. The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following Belgium's Reynaert with \"Laissez briller le soleil\" and preceding Italy's Luca Barbarossa with \"Vivo (Ti scrivo)\"). At the close of voting, it had received 90 points, placing 4th in a field of 21. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1989 Contest by Park Caf\u00e9 with \"Monsieur\". In 1999 \"Croire\" was included as a bonus track on Lara Fabian's eponymously titled debut album, originally released in 1991. 1988 was the last year Luxembourg ended in the top 5 and it was also the last year Luxembourg ended in the top 10 ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1988 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Croire\". * [ Allmusic.com, Lara Fabian biography.] Category:Eurovision songs of Luxembourg Category:Lara Fabian songs Category:Eurovision songs of 1988 ",
