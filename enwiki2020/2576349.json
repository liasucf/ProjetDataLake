    "text": "The Flaws were an Irish indie-rock quartet, hailing from Carrickmacross in County Monaghan. The band released their self entitled debut EP in the Summer of 2005 which attracted a flurry of label attention and eventually culminated in the signing of a 5-album contract to Polydor UK/ Universal Music in December 2005. The flaws released three full-length studio albums between 2007 and 2016. The Flaws consist of: Paul Finn on Vocals/Guitar, Paul Mallon on Bass/Backing Vocals, Shane Malone, Lead Guitar and drummer Colin Berrill. ==Career== ===Background=== The original group went to Patrician High School secondary school together in Carrickmacross and formed a band in the early 2000s called Sweet Relief during their Dublin college years. A more serious approach to original music culminated in a band name change, the recruiting of Dundalk music guru Derek Turner of Tumbleweed Studios, Spirit Store and Honey Thieves fame and extensive Irish original music venue touring ensured a sound foundation for the quartet in those early years. Popular venues such as the aforementioned Spirit Store, McHughs Drogheda, Eamon Doran\u2019s, Cypress Avenue, Dolan\u2019s, Auntie Annies, McGarrigles, Voodoo Lounge, Yukon Bar, An Roisin Dubh were frequented as the band shaped their musical niche. The Flaws embarked on an extensive tour during the Summer of 2005 around Ireland with Dublin band Delorentos and Belfast indie outfit Fast Emperors. Other high-profile support slots to The Fratellis and Editors helped bolster the bands growing popularity in the early days. In July 2007 original drummer, founding member Stephen Finnegan left the band for personal reasons. ===Popularity=== The Flaws played the Crawdaddy Stage of Electric Picnic at 13:15 on Sunday 2 September 2007. They did an instore in BPM in Wexford on Sunday 28 October at 15:30. They played \"Rock 'N Roulette\" on The Podge and Rodge Show on Tuesday 20 November. The Flaws were nominated for two Meteor Awards in the categories \"Best Irish Album\", and \"Best Irish Band\" at the 2008 Meteor Awards. Their debut album, Achieving Vagueness was also nominated for the Choice Music Prize. The list of 2008 festival appearances for the band includes a return to the Electric Picnic and slots at Glastonbury, Indie-pendence and Castlepalooza.

National commercial radio station Today FM broadcast the track on Alison Curtis's The Last Splash programme, in which she described the lead track \"16\" as \"brilliant\". The EP also includes the tracks \"Idolise\", \"Everybody's Got to be Somewhere\" and \"Fed to the Lions\".
