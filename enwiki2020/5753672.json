    "text": "The Northern Elite League (NEL) was created in 1992, as a way of giving Northern Ontario baseball players a competitive league of their own. This task was spearheaded by North Bay's Peter Topolie, who is the current president of Baseball Ontario. The NEL originally had 6 teams competing for the Blue Jay Cup. They were: *North Bay Jays *Sault Ste. Marie Cambrian Nissan *Sudbury Lakers *Timmins Whiskey Jacks *Garson Tigers *North Shore Knights This league features teams playing in a Showcase Tournament, a 15-game regular season, and playoffs at the home of the 1st place team. The 2006 season has four teams: *Sault Ste. Marie Black Sox *Sudbury Reds *Timmins Whiskey Jacks *Valley East Vipers == Professional Alumni == The NEL has produced 2 professional players. Aaron Fera, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., was a 32nd round draft pick of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1999 out of a college in Georgia. He made it to High A with the St. Louis Cardinals Organization and finished off by playing a few seasons of Independent baseball. He was a power hitting outfielder for the Soo Black Sox during his time in the NEL. The second professional player produced was James Pidutti, who was signed by the Blue Jays in 2002 as a free agent. The left-handed reliever pitched in 44 innings over 2 seasons at the Rookie Ball level. James was known for his sinking fastball that topped out at 90 mph with movement. He was also a bruising power hitter for the Sudbury Lakers during his NEL days. He had a career 5.68 ERA in 30 affiliated professional games. Pidutti was signed to a 2005 contract to Calgary of the Northern Independent League before finishing up in Rimini of the Italian Series A, Division 1 League. 2006 saw Soo Native, Tyler Binkley get drafted in the 40th round out of high-school to the New York Mets but elected to play at powerhouse Seward Community College in Kansas where he posted a 4.73 ERA. in 78 innings before playing briefly at a South Dakota university. 2007\\. Soo native Kai Tuomi, drafted in the 40th round to the Washington Nationals after a long and successful 4 seasons at the University of Evansville. 24-10 and career 3.79 ERA.
