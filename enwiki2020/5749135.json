    "text": "Rhamphosuchus (\"Beak crocodile\") is an extinct relative of the modern false gharial. It lived during the Miocene and its fossils have been found in two regions; the Siwalik Hills of Pakistan and India as well as the Sindh region of Pakistan. It is only known from incomplete sets of fossils, mostly teeth and skulls. Four species belonging into the genus Gavialis may be included. ==Overview== Rhamphosuchus crassidens jaws An 1868 illustration of specimens of R. crassidens (top and center) compared to other crocodylian fossils from the Sewalik Hills Traditionally, many palaeontologists estimated that it was one of the largest, if not the largest crocodylian that ever lived, reaching an estimated length of . However, a more recent study suggests that the animal may have been 8\u201311 m (26 to 36 ft) in length, and therefore is not the largest known crocodylian. Another crocodylian, Purussaurus, from the Miocene of Peru and Brazil, is known from an equally incomplete fossil set. It is estimated to have been similar in length to the initial estimates at approximately 12 m (about 40ft). However, this would mean that it would have been somewhat larger in size if the more recent size estimates for Rhamphosuchus are correct. If the most recent estimate is correct, then several other extinct crocodylians also surpassed Rhamphosuchus in length, such as the Late Cretaceous alligatoroid Deinosuchus, the Early Cretaceous pholidosaurid Sarcosuchus, the Miocene gavialid Gryposuchus and the strange planktivorous Mourasuchus (a contemporary of Purussaurus), at 12 m, 9.5 m, 10.15 m, and 12 m, respectively. Rhamphosuchus probably had a more generalized predatory diet than the piscivory of other tomistomines. ==References== ==External links== Category:Crocodilians Category:Miocene crocodylomorphs Category:Miocene reptiles of Asia Category:Prehistoric reptile genera ",
