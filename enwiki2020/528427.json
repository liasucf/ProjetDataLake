    "text": "Gaspard de la nuit (subtitled Trois po\u00e8mes pour piano d'apr\u00e8s Aloysius Bertrand), M. 55 is a suite of piano pieces by Maurice Ravel, written in 1908. It has three movements, each based on a poem or fantaisie from the collection Gaspard de la Nuit \u2013 Fantaisies \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de Rembrandt et de Callot completed in 1836 by Aloysius Bertrand. The work was premiered in Paris, on January 9, 1909, by Ricardo Vi\u00f1es. The piece is famous for its difficulty, partly because Ravel intended the Scarbo movement to be more difficult than Balakirev's Islamey. Because of its technical challenges and profound musical structure, Scarbo is considered one of the most difficult solo piano pieces in the standard repertoire. The manuscript currently resides in the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin. == Etymology == The name \"Gaspard\" is derived from its original Persian form, denoting \"the man in charge of the royal treasures\": \"Gaspard of the Night\" or the treasurer of the night thus creates allusions to someone in charge of all that is jewel-like, dark, mysterious, perhaps even morose. Of the work, Ravel himself said: \"Gaspard has been a devil in coming, but that is only logical since it was he who is the author of the poems. My ambition is to say with notes what a poet expresses with words.\" Aloysius Bertrand, author of Gaspard de la Nuit (1842), introduces his collection by attributing them to a mysterious old man met in a park in Dijon, who lent him the book. When he goes in search of M. Gaspard to return the volume, he asks, 'Tell me where M. Gaspard de la Nuit may be found.' 'He is in hell, provided that he isn't somewhere else,' comes the reply. 'Ah! I am beginning to understand! What! Gaspard de la Nuit must be...?' the poet continues. 'Ah! Yes... the devil!' his informant responds. 'Thank you, '!... If Gaspard de la Nuit is in hell, may he roast there. I shall publish his book.'Bertrand Gu\u00e9gan (Ed.), Gaspard de la Nuit, Fantaisies \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de Rembrandt et de Callot, par Aloysius Bertrand. Edition publi\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit de l'auteur (Payot, Paris 1925), p. 24. ==Structure== ===I. Ondine=== Written in C major and based on the poem \"Ondine\", an oneiric tale of the water nymph Undine singing to seduce the observer into visiting her kingdom deep at the bottom of a lake. It is reminiscent of Ravel's early piano piece, the Jeux d'eau (1901), with the sounds of water falling and flowing, woven with cascades. There are five main melodies. The opening melody at bar 2 evokes a line of song and is similar in form and subject to the main theme in Sir\u00e8nes from Claude Debussy's Nocturnes. This is interrupted by the second theme at bar 10 before opening up a longer melodic passage formed from the latter part of theme 1. Then a short simple melody first heard at bar 23 introduces shimmering harmonic side-shifting. The final distinct melody is a menacing short rising figure first heard at bar 45, which prefaces the menace of Le Gibet and which later provides a bridge to the main climax at bar 66. Ravel prioritises melodic development to express the poetic themes, keeping subordinate the simmering coloration of the right hand. By contrast, Claude Debussy's works such as Reflets dans l'eau tend to treat melody more equally with harmonic and figurative impulsivity, and often position virtuosity more in the foreground. This piece contains technical challenges for the right hand such as the fast repetition of three-note chords in the opening accompaniment, the double note passages beginning at bar 57, and the disjunct climactic movement of the hands beginning at bar 66.Ravel, Gaspard de la Nuit, \u00c9ditions Durand & Cie, Paris 1957. The duration of Ondine is about 6:30. Recordings vary in tempo, driven perhaps by the tension of keeping the shimmering alternating notes from becoming mechanical, yet giving sufficient space for the lyricism of the melodies. {| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Ondine |- | style=\"padding-right:2em;\" width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" |. . . . . . . . Je croyais entendre Une vague harmonie enchanter mon sommeil, Et pr\u00e8s de moi s'\u00e9pandre un murmure pareil Aux chants entrecoup\u00e9s d'une voix triste et tendre. Ch. Brugnot. \u2013 Les deux G\u00e9nies \u00bb \u00c9coute ! \u2013 \u00c9coute ! \u2013 C'est moi, c'est Ondine qui fr\u00f4le de ces gouttes d'eau les losanges sonores de ta fen\u00eatre illumin\u00e9e par les mornes rayons de la lune; et voici, en robe de moire, la dame ch\u00e2telaine qui contemple \u00e0 son balcon la belle nuit \u00e9toil\u00e9e et le beau lac endormi. \u00bb Chaque flot est un ondin qui nage dans le courant, chaque courant est un sentier qui serpente vers mon palais, et mon palais est b\u00e2ti fluide, au fond du lac, dans le triangle du feu, de la terre et de l'air. \u00bb \u00c9coute ! \u2013 \u00c9coute ! \u2013 Mon p\u00e8re bat l'eau coassante d'une branche d'aulne verte, et mes s\u0153urs caressent de leurs bras d'\u00e9cume les fra\u00eeches \u00eeles d'herbes, de n\u00e9nuphars et de gla\u00eeeuls, ou se moquent du saule caduc et barbu qui p\u00eache \u00e0 la ligne. \u00bb Sa chanson murmur\u00e9e, elle me supplia de recevoir son anneau \u00e0 mon doigt, pour \u00eatre l'\u00e9poux d'une Ondine, et de visiter avec elle son palais, pour \u00eatre le roi des lacs. Et comme je lui r\u00e9pondais que j'aimais une mortelle, boudeuse et d\u00e9pit\u00e9e, elle pleura quelques larmes, poussa un \u00e9clat de rire, et s'\u00e9vanouit en giboul\u00e9es qui ruissel\u00e8rent blanches le long de mes vitraux bleus. | width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" |. . . . . . . . I thought I heard A faint harmony that enchants my sleep. And close to me radiates an identical murmur Of songs interrupted by a sad and tender voice. Ch. Brugnot \u2013 The two Spirits \"Listen! \u2013 Listen! \u2013 It is I, it is Ondine who brushes drops of water on the resonant panes of your windows lit by the gloomy rays of the moon; and here in gown of watered silk, the mistress of the chateau gazes from her balcony on the beautiful starry night and the beautiful sleeping lake. \"Each wave is a water sprite who swims in the stream, each stream is a footpath that winds towards my palace, and my palace is a fluid structure, at the bottom of the lake, in a triangle of fire, of earth and of air. \"Listen! \u2013 Listen! \u2013 My father whips the croaking water with a branch of a green alder tree, and my sisters caress with their arms of foam the cool islands of herbs, of water lilies, and of corn flowers, or laugh at the decrepit and bearded willow who fishes at the line.\" Her song murmured, she beseeched me to accept her ring on my finger, to be the husband of an Ondine, and to visit her in her palace and be king of the lakes. And as I was replying to her that I loved a mortal, sullen and spiteful, she wept some tears, uttered a burst of laughter, and vanished in a shower that streamed white down the length of my blue stained glass windows. |} ===II. Le Gibet=== Written in E minor and based on the poem \"Le Gibet\",Le Gibet was one of the additional pieces not contained in the original 1836 manuscript of Bertrand, see Gu\u00e9gan, Gaspard de la Nuit (1925), pp. 217\u201318. the observer is presented with a view of the desert, where the lone corpse of a hanged man on a gibbet stands out against the horizon, reddened by the setting sun. Meanwhile, a bell tolls from inside the walls of a far-off city, creating the deathly atmosphere that surrounds the observer. Throughout the entire piece is a B octave ostinato, imitative of the tolling bell, that must remain distinctive and constant in tone as the notes cross over and dynamics change. The duration of Le Gibet is about 5:15. {| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Le Gibet |- | style=\"padding-right:2em;\" width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" |Que vois-je remuer autour de ce Gibet? \u2013 Faust. Ah! ce que j'entends, serait-ce la bise nocturne qui glapit, ou le pendu qui pousse un soupir sur la fourche patibulaire? Serait-ce quelque grillon qui chante tapi dans la mousse et le lierre st\u00e9rile dont par piti\u00e9 se chausse le bois? Serait- ce quelque mouche en chasse sonnant du cor autour de ces oreilles sourdes \u00e0 la fanfare des hallali? Serait-ce quelque escarbot qui cueille en son vol in\u00e9gal un cheveu sanglant \u00e0 son cr\u00e2ne chauve? Ou bien serait-ce quelque araign\u00e9e qui brode une demi-aune de mousseline pour cravate \u00e0 ce col \u00e9trangl\u00e9? C'est la cloche qui tinte aux murs d'une ville sous l'horizon, et la carcasse d'un pendu que rougit le soleil couchant. | width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" |What do I see stirring around that gibbet? \u2013 Faust. Ah! that which I hear, was it the north wind that screeches in the night, or the hanged one who utters a sigh on the fork of the gibbet? Was it some cricket who sings lurking in the moss and the sterile ivy, which out of pity covers the floor of the forest? Was it some fly in chase sounding the horn around those ears deaf to the fanfare of the halloos? Was it some scarab beetle who gathers in his uneven flight a bloody hair from his bald skull? Or then, was it some spider who embroiders a half- measure of muslin for a tie on this strangled neck? It is the bell that tolls from the walls of a city, under the horizon, and the corpse of the hanged one that is reddened by the setting sun. |} ===III. Scarbo=== An excerpt of the third movement, Scarbo, appears in a mural in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Written in G minor and based on the poem \"Scarbo\",The version of 'Scarbo' quoted here is not the same as the piece which appeared under that name in the original 1836 manuscript of Bertrand's, but one of the supplementary poems found among his papers. The original Scarbo, number ii of the third book of Gaspard de la Nuit, 'La Nuit et ses Prestiges', is a completely different text. The gnome Scarbo also appears in other pieces. See Gu\u00e9gan, Gaspard de la Nuit (1925), pp. 219\u201320. this movement depicts the nighttime mischief of a small fiend or goblin, making pirouettes, flitting in and out of the darkness, disappearing and suddenly reappearing. Its uneven flight, hitting and scratching against the walls, casting a growing shadow in the moonlight, creates a nightmarish scene for the observer lying in his bed. With its repeated notes and two terrifying climaxes, this is the high point in technical difficulty of all the three movements. Technical challenges include repeated notes in both hands, and double-note scales in major seconds in the right hand. Ravel reportedly said about Scarbo: \"I wanted to write an orchestral transcription for the piano.\" The duration of Scarbo is about 8:30. {| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Scarbo |- | style=\"padding-right:2em;\" width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" |Il regarda sous le lit, dans la chemin\u00e9e, dans le bahut; \u2013 personne. Il ne put comprendre par o\u00f9 il s'\u00e9tait introduit, par o\u00f9 il s'\u00e9tait \u00e9vad\u00e9. Hoffmann. \u2013 Contes nocturnes Oh! que de fois je l'ai entendu et vu, Scarbo, lorsqu'\u00e0 minuit la lune brille dans le ciel comme un \u00e9cu d'argent sur une banni\u00e8re d'azur sem\u00e9e d'abeilles d'or! Que de fois j'ai entendu bourdonner son rire dans l'ombre de mon alc\u00f4ve, et grincer son ongle sur la soie des courtines de mon lit! Que de fois je l'ai vu descendre du plancher, pirouetter sur un pied et rouler par la chambre comme le fuseau tomb\u00e9 de la quenouille d'une sorci\u00e8re! Le croyais-je alors \u00e9vanoui? le nain grandissait entre la lune et moi comme le clocher d'une cath\u00e9drale gothique, un grelot d'or en branle \u00e0 son bonnet pointu! Mais bient\u00f4t son corps bleuissait, diaphane comme la cire d'une bougie, son visage bl\u00eamissait comme la cire d'un lumignon, \u2013 et soudain il s'\u00e9teignait. | width=\"400px\" valign=\"top\" | He looked under the bed, in the chimney, in the cupboard; \u2013 nobody. He could not understand how he got in, or how he escaped. Hoffmann. \u2013 Nocturnal Tales Oh! how often have I heard and seen him, Scarbo, when at midnight the moon glitters in the sky like a silver shield on an azure banner strewn with golden bees. How often have I heard his laughter buzz in the shadow of my alcove, and his fingernail grate on the silk of the curtains of my bed! How often have I seen him alight on the floor, pirouette on a foot and roll through the room like the spindle fallen from the wand of a sorceress! Do I think him vanished then? the dwarf grows between the moon and me like the belfry of a gothic cathedral, a golden bell shakes on his pointed cap! But soon his body becomes blue, translucent like the wax of a candle, his face pales like the wax of a candle end \u2013 and suddenly he is extinguished. |} ==Orchestral versions== Eugene Goossens orchestrated Gaspard in 1942.\"Ravel \u2013 Goossens: Gaspard de la nuit (arr. 1942)\" at Boosey & Hawkes Marius Constant orchestrated the piece in 1990. ==Notes== ==External links== * Piano Society.com \u2013 Ravel \u2013 Gaspard de la nuit \u2013 includes free recordings of \"Ondine\" and \"Scarbo\". * *BBC Discovering Music \u2013 Includes lecture and performance \u2013 1 hour and 30 minutes * The Shady Lane Publishing Includes Creative Commons recording and sheet music of \"Le gibet\" transcription for two guitars by M.
