    "text": "FAA Order 8110.105A, Simple and Complex Electronic Hardware Approval Guidance, supplements RTCA DO-254 by explaining how FAA aircraft certification staff can use that document \"when working on certification projects\". A particular focus is on clarification of the application of DO-254 guidance to simple custom micro-coded components (for example, ASICs PLDs, or FPGAs with simple firmware functions installed) as opposed to the more rigorous assurance expected of complex custom micro-coded components. For the purposes of certification, \"A hardware item is considered simple if a comprehensive combination of deterministic tests and analyses can ensure correct functional performance under all foreseeable operating conditions with no anomalous behavior.\" All other hardware items are considered complex and, since complex hardware items cannot be completely validated by testing alone, design assurance methodology is required.RTCA/DO-254 \"Design Assurance Guidance For Airborne Electronic Hardware\", Appendix C Advisory circular 20-152 recognizes the guidance in DO-254 as a suitable means for demonstrating compliance for the use of complex custom micro-coded components within aircraft systems.AC 20-152, FAA, Office AIR-100, 2005. \"This AC recognizes the guidance in RTCA/DO-254 applies specifically to complex custom micro-coded components with hardware design assurance levels of A, B, and C, such as ASICs, PLDs, and FPGAs\", Page 1. However, application of DO-254 to simple micro-coded components was not explicitly addressed by that circular. Initially, applicants and developers were concerned with the apparent ambiguity of DO-254's guidance on simple electronic hardware; that document is largely concerned with the objectives and activities of developing complex electronic hardware. In response, CAST-30 Simple Electronic Hardware and RTCA Document DO-254 and EUROCAE Document ED-80 was completed in 2007 to provide clarification to the guidance in DO-254/ED-80 specifically for simple electronic hardware. Following this, FAA Order 8110.105 was released in 2008 to supplement the guidance for both simple and complex electronic hardware, and revised to Revision A in 2017. Three primary chapters are clarification of topics applicable to both simple and complex electronic hardware, topics applicable to complex electronic hardware alone, and topics applicable to simple electronic hardware alone. == References == ==External links== * * Regulations & Policies on the FAA website Category:Civil aviation in the United States Category:Federal Aviation Administration ",
