    "text": "Am Universum is the fifth album by heavy metal band Amorphis. This album was a departure from the doom/stoner metal influence on their previous album, Tuonela, featuring more of a vocal-driven hard rock sound. This is the first album to feature Niklas Etel\u00e4vuori on bass who would remain in the band until 2017. The song \"Alone\" is also on the live DVD, Forging the Land of Thousand Lakes. The edited version of the song is on the single itself, and is also on Amorphis' greatest hits compilation album, Chapters. The DVD and the compilation both have the music video for the song. Other songs that are also on the compilation are \"Too Much to See\", which is also on the \"Alone\" single and \"Drifting Memories\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Amorphis=== * Pasi Koskinen \u2013 vocals * Esa Holopainen \u2013 lead guitar * Tomi Koivusaari \u2013 rhythm guitar * Niclas Etel\u00e4vuori \u2013 bass guitar * Santeri Kallio \u2212 keyboards; synthesizer * Pekka Kasari \u2212 drums ===Session musicians=== * Sakari Kukko \u2212 saxophone (on tracks 1, 5, 6, 8, 10) * Antti Halonen \u2212 saw (on track 10) ==References== Category:2001 albums Category:Amorphis albums Category:Relapse Records albums ",
