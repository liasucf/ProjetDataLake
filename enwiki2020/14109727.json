    "text": "Teodoro Fern\u00e1ndez Meyz\u00e1n (born 20 May 1913 in Ca\u00f1ete \u2014 died 17 September 1996 in Lima), nicknamed \"Lolo\", was a Peruvian football striker. He was part of the Peru national football team that reached quarter-finals in the 1936 Summer Olympics and won the 1939 Copa America, a tournament where he emerged as the top scorer and best player. He was captain of the Peru national football team from 1935 to 1947 scoring 24 goals in 32 matches. Fern\u00e1ndez is the most emblematic player in the history of club Universitario de Deportes for which he played his whole career, winning six times the Primera Divisi\u00f3n Peruana. Although he sporadically reinforced other clubs in friendly matches, clubs such as Alianza Lima and Colo-Colo, Fern\u00e1ndez never represented a club other than Universitario in official competitions. Known as \"El Ca\u00f1onero\" (\"The Cannoneer\") due to his excellence as a centre-forward and his strong shooting, Fern\u00e1ndez was the Primera Divisi\u00f3n Peruana top-scorer seven times. ==Club career== Lolo was the seventh of Raymunda Meyz\u00e1n and Tomas Fern\u00e1ndez's eight children. He learned to play football in primary school and was soon picked up by local club Hurac\u00e1n de Hualcar\u00e1 where he immediately stood out. At the age of 16, his parents sent him to Lima to continue his studies. Lolo stayed with his brother Arturo Fernandez who was the goalkeeper for Ciclista Lima. When Arturo transferred to first-division Universitario de Deportes , he brought Lolo along to play a bit of football in training and introduced him to the club's President, former 1930 World Cup player Placido Galindo, who decided to sign him. Lolo would remain with the club during his 22 years as a professional footballer.One-club man He made his professional debut with Universitario de Deportes in a friendly match against Club Deportivo Magallanes of Chile on 29 November 1931, scoring the game's only goal. In his first season (1932) he became Peruvian top scorer, the team finished second. The following year, the same feat was repeated. The 1934 season saw Lolo lead the division in scoring, winning the Primera Divisi\u00f3n Peruana trophy for the only second time in its history. Lolo obtained 6 local leagues as player in total, all with Universitario de Deportes: 1934, 1939, 1941, 1945, 1946 and 1949. Several times during his career he rejected offers from teams such as in Chile, Argentina and Europe. Rumor has it Chile offered him a \"blank check\", for he to write in what he wished to be paid. He did not go with Chile. Lolo played his last game for Universitario on 30 August 1953 at the age of 40 in the Peruvian Super Classic during which he scored a hat-trick for a 4\u20132 win. Lolo is the top goalscorer for Universitario with 156 goals in 180 matches. ==International career== Alcalde, Teodoro Fern\u00e1ndez, Morales, and Villanueva.
