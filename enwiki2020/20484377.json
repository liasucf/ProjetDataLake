Born in Cape Town, Jameson was educated in the United Kingdom. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge after attending King's College London. He moved to Canada in 1876, first practicing law in Toronto then received his admission to the bar in Ontario the following year. He moved to Winnipeg in 1881 to conduct land speculation at a time when that city's economy enjoyed considerable growth. He was inducted into Manitoba's provincial bar in 1882. Following terms as Winnipeg alderman since 1892, Jameson was elected the city's Mayor for 1896. After the federal election results for the Winnipeg riding were annulled in March 1897, Jameson entered a by-election as a Liberal candidate. He won the riding on 27 April 1897 and served for a portion of the 8th Canadian Parliament. However, Jameson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on 21 February 1899 shortly after presenting a speech to the Winnipeg Board of Trade. However, an investigation concluded that his death was not suicidal but accidental in nature. Winnipeg named Jamison Avenue in his honour.History in Winnipeg Street Names at Manitoba Historical Society ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1851 births Category:1899 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:British expatriates in Canada Category:Deaths by firearm in Manitoba Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Lawyers in Manitoba Category:Mayors of Winnipeg Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Category:Lawyers in Ontario Category:Politicians from Cape Town Category:Cape Colony people Category:South African expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Accidental deaths in Manitoba Category:Firearm accident victims ",
