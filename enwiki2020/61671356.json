However it is generally believed by modern scholars that the accusation, though perhaps true, was essentially a pretext on which Hyperides could harass Aristagora after a bad breakup. * Aristagora, a woman of Corinth, also a hetaira, and the mistress of Demetrius of Phalerum, the grandson of (the much more well known) Demetrius of Phalerum.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 4.167d. e. ==References== Category:Hetairai Category:4th-century BC Greek people Category:Ancient Corinthians Category:4th-century BC Greek women ",
