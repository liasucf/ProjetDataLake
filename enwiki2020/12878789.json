    "text": "Mark Scott (February 21, 1915 \u2013 July 13, 1960) was an actor and broadcaster. He is probably best known for hosting the Home Run Derby television show that originally aired in 1960. Scott, who was a native of Chicago, died of a heart attack in Burbank, California, shortly after the first season of the show aired. Rather than find a replacement for him, the producers decided to cancel the series. During the Home Run Derby show, he both announced the action and interviewed each contestant when his opponent was batting. His most well known line from the show was, \"It's a home run or nothing here on Home Run Derby.\" Prior to Home Run Derby, he had been an announcer for the 1956 Cincinnati Reds and for the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, which transferred out of the city after the 1957 season due to the arrival of the Los Angeles Dodgers. ==External links== * Category:1915 births Category:1960 deaths Category:American game show hosts Category:American male television actors Category:Male actors from Illinois Category:American sports announcers Category:National Football League announcers Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:20th-century American male actors ",
