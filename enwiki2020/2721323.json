He worked as a pharmacist, and was executive assistant to the registrar of the Ontario College of Pharmacists from 1961 to 1969. Leluk was both a freemason and a Knight of Malta.

He was narrowly re- elected in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Leonard Braithwaite by 715 votes. The Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a tenuous minority government in this election.

Leluk served as an opposition member for two years, and did not run for re-election in 1987.
