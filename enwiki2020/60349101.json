In March 2019, the ship was hijacked by migrants\u2014which the ship had stopped to rescue\u2014off of the coast of Libya. This hijacking received considerable coverage in international media. == Hijacking == On 27 March 2019, the ship was hijacked by over 100 migrants who the ship had rescued from the Mediterranean. The hijacking came after a group of men forced Elhiblu 1's captain and crew to divert course from Tripoli (where the ship was sailing to deliver the recently shipwrecked migrants) to Malta. As the ship was approaching Maltese waters, the captain was able to inform the Maltese government he was not in control of his vessel, and that \"through coercive action\" a group of men had hijacked the ship. Elhiblu 1 was later intercepted by the Special Operations Unit of Armed Forces of Malta, which regained control of the ship and detained 5 of the alleged hijackers before escorting Elhiblu 1 to Valletta, Malta. == References == Category:2015 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 2019 Category:March 2019 events in Europe ",
