    "text": "A Ratusz () (; , Ratusha; ) is a historic administrative building in countries that adopted the Magdeburg rights such as the Holy Roman Empire, Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth and others. It was distinguished with a bell tower (lookout or a clock tower). Unlike a regular city hall which may or may not have any specific architectural compositions, ratusz (rathaus) always consisted of a building with a tower. Ratusz was primarily designated as a city hall, traditionally built in the centre of a town or in the middle of a town square or more common market square (freedom of trade as the main goal of Magdeburg rights). Although the old ratusz can still maintain the function of a seat of local government, frequently it is separated from the contemporary city government, the administrative building housing the town council, and often serves as a museum of local history (for example in Ivano-Frankivsk and Tarn\u00f3w among many others). ==History== Prominent examples of a historic ratusz can be found in at least 82 Polish cities. Some of them date back to the mid-13th century, like the ratusz in Kalisz.Janusz Rosiko\u0144, Ratusze w Polsce Rosikon PressSzlakiem Rynk\u00f3w i Ratuszy w Polsce PTTKEl\u017cbieta Zag\u0142oba-Zygler, 20 lat rajdu motorowego PTTK \"Ratusze w Polsce\" \"Gosciniec\" Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, PTTK The oldest tower still standing was erected in 1274 in Toru\u0144 while the actual building with 365 windows comes from the 14th century.Douglas Stallings, Ratusz (town hall) in Toru\u0144 Fodor's Poland. Random House, 2007. . The ratusz in Zamo\u015b\u0107, built during the Renaissance in Poland, is one of the highest achievements of Renaissance architecture anywhere in the country. It was intentionally placed in the corner of the town square not to outshine the nearby Zamoyski Palace of the city's owners, which it did anyway, once the imposing Baroque staircase was added in the 17th century.Douglas Stallings, Ratusz (town hall) in Zamo\u015b\u0107 Fodor's Poland, p. 238. Random House, 2007. . The ratusz in Pozna\u0144, dating from the mid-16th century, has a clock with billy goats butting heads, which attracts hundreds of spectators every day in tourist season.Douglas Stallings, Ratusz (town hall) in Pozna\u0144 Fodor's Poland, p. 131. Random House, 2007. . Throughout the centuries many Polish town halls have been damaged in foreign invasions, such as the ratusz in Sandomierz, with city rights since 1286, meticulously renovated before being turned into a museum.Wykaz ratuszy z Polski (Compendium of Poland's ratuszes) History and photographs. JakTrafic.org. In the royal city of Krak\u00f3w, the historic ratusz, built of brick and mortar in the centre of Main Square, originally in 1316, has been torn down not by the occupiers, but by the Cracovians themselves in 1820 because it was not considered pretty enough. What remains of it is the massive town-hall tower, a prominent example of Polish Gothic architecture.Kamil Janicki, Co si\u0119 sta\u0142o z krakowskim ratuszem? Ciekawostki turystyczne. A considerable number of heritage city halls became historical museums in the 20th century, including the ratusz in Toru\u0144 (Toru\u0144 Regional Museum or Muzeum Okr\u0119gowe in Polish), with stained glass and gingerbread divisions, in Pozna\u0144 (Muzeum Okr\u0119gowe), with a Chopin division, in Lublin (Muzeum Okr\u0119gowe), Siedlce (Muzeum Okr\u0119gowe), Bia\u0142ystok (Muzeum Podlaskie), Gda\u0144sk (Muzeum Historii Miasta), Sandomierz (Muzeum Okr\u0119gowe), and Szczecin (Muzeum Historii Miasta Szczecina). Others still serve as seats of local government, and sometimes also as civil wedding halls and art galleries, restaurants, and cultural centres. These include Zamo\u015b\u0107, Kielce, Zielona G\u00f3ra (also a civil wedding hall, restaurant, and winery), K\u0119trzyn (also a wedding hall and cultural centre), and Ko\u0142obrzeg (also a wedding hall, cultural centre, and gallery of modern art). ==Etymology== The Polish word ratusz to describe a city hall is derived from the German Rathaus (council house) sometime during the Middle Ages. The influence also serves as a metonym for the burmistrz (burgomaster, or mayor), derived from the German b\u00fcrgermeister. Since 1980, the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society (PTTK) offers a badge for tourists interested in organizing group excursions across the country with the aim of visiting the maximum number of ratusz towns and cities. The PTTK hands out a special booklet where stamps can be collected for the gold badge awarded for visiting a minimum of twenty ratusz outlets. ==Prominent examples== File:Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Town Hall.jpg| Bielsko-Bia\u0142a File:Chelmno ratusz 03.jpg|Che\u0142mno File:PL Jawor Ratusz.JPG| Jawor File:PL Kalisz Ratusz..JPG| Kalisz File:K\u0142odzko - Ratusz.JPG| K\u0142odzko File:Lublin Nowy Ratusz.jpg| Lublin File:Ns ratusz.jpg| Nowy S\u0105cz File:Paczk\u00f3w - Town hall.jpg| Paczk\u00f3w File:Ratusz2007.jpg|Pozna\u0144 File:Sandomierz Town Hall 20051004 1200.jpg| Sandomierz File:Sulech\u00f3w-ratusz.jpg| Sulech\u00f3w File:Jaros\u0142aw Ratusz 2.JPG|Jaros\u0142aw File:Toru\u0144 - Ratusz noc\u0105.jpg|Toru\u0144 File:Zamosc Town Hall 01.jpg| Zamo\u015b\u0107 File:Ziebice-ratusz.jpg| Zi\u0119bice File:Kolomiya town hall1.JPG| Kolomyia File:Lw\u00f3w - Ratusz.jpg| Lviv File:Townhall ivano-frankivsk.jpg| Ivano-Frankivsk File:HH Rathaus pano1.jpg|City hall in Hamburg (Rathaus) ==References== Category:Polish words and phrases Category:Gubernatorial titles Category:Architecture of Poland Category:Magdeburg rights ",
