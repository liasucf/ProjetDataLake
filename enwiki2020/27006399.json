    "text": "Liz Lerman (born 1947 in Los Angeles, CA) is an American choreographer and founder of Liz Lerman Dance Exchange .http://www.danceexchange.org/whoweare.html#staffandcohttp://www.danceexchange.org/whoweare.html Her style of dance-making is characterized by personal story, multi- generational casting, current events, scientific research, humor, public participation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Characterized by the Washington Post as \u201cthe source of an epochal revolution in the scope and purposes of dance art,\u201d she and her dancers have collaborated with shipbuilders, physicists, construction workers, and cancer researchers. In 2002 she won the MacArthur Genius Grant; in 2009, the Jack P. Blaney Award in Dialogue acknowledged her outstanding leadership, creativity, and dedication to melding dialogue with dance; and the 2017 Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Award. == Early life == Liz Lerman was born in Los Angeles, California on Christmas Day, 1947. Her father Philip was an organizer and activist, and her mother was an artist. Though her family moved several times when she was growing up, much of her early education was spent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When she was 14 years old, she danced in Washington, DC, for President Kennedy as part of a group from the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan. She attended Bennington College, where she studied under Martha Wittman, who would later become a company member of Dance Exchange. She graduated received her B.A. in dance from the University of Maryland and an M.A. in dance from George Washington University. ==Career== She founded the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange in 1976 and led the company's multi-generational ensemble until July 2011, when Lerman passed the leadership of her company to Cassie Meador,; the company is now called simply Dance Exchange. . Under Liz's leadership Dance Exchange appeared across the U.S. in locations as various as the National Cathedral,http://www.nationalcathedral.org/staff/PE-49EKF-58001D.shtml Kennedy Center Opera House, and Millennium Stage,http://www.kennedy- center.org/programs/millennium/artist_detail.cfm?artist_id=lizlerdanc Lansburgh Theatre,http://www.jewish- theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2098 Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, Harvard University,http://www.jewish- theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=1639 and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.http://mcachicago.org/performances/now/all/2011/741 Lerman's early work was strongly associated with the inclusion of older people alongside more traditional young performers,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/11/arts/dance-690309.html and with the use of personal narrative. Her later-career work has focused on questions of science from genomicshttps://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/arts/dance/03lerm.html?_r=0 to high-energy physicshttp://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2011/03/the_matter_of_origins_preview.html to the physical and psychic wounds of war.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-06-23/entertainment/bal-liz-lermans- healing-wars-provides-unique-theatrical-experience-20140623_1_liz-lerman- national-civil-war-project-arena-stage In January 2016 Liz Lerman joined the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona as Institute Professor to lead programs and courses that span disciplines across ASU. == Liz-as-Toolmaker == Lerman has a strong interest in generating, defining, iterating, and sharing the \"tools\" that result from her artistic processes. A \u201ctool\u201d, she describes could be a piece of information that is detached from other concepts and can be applied to many situations. These ideas also that the form of challenges or reminders to her artists, including \u201cRattle around in someone else\u2019s universe\u201d; \u201cTurn discomfort into inquiry\u201d; \u201cNothing is too small to notice\u201d. At Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, her tool sharing took the form of an online \"Toolbox,\" with a later iteration called \"D-Lab\" that aimed to make certain tools widely accessible. Currently, Lerman is developing a new online platform, called The Atlas of Creative Tools, as the home for her existing and future tools. == Critical Response Process == Lerman created the Critical Response Process, a method for giving and receiving feedback. Lerman developed the Process (known as CRP) in 1990 after realizing artists tended to apologize, rather than ask questions, when presenting unfinished work. The Process was formalized through the publication of the book \"Critical Response Process: getting useful feedback on anything you make, from dance to dessert\" in 2003 which Lerman wrote with co-author John Borstel. Critical Response Process has a significant international presence, with institutional hosts including the Innovative Conservatoire,http://www.innovativeconservatoire.com/events/icon- seminar-13-kallio-kuninkala-helsinki-2/ the Federation of Scottish Theatres,http://www.scottishtheatre.org/projects-services/critical-response- process the London Sinfonietta,http://www.londonsinfonietta.org.uk/event/making-connections- collaborating-across-artforms-conference the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and Yorkshire Dancehttp://www.yorkshiredance.com/news/critical- response-process-workshop-with-liz-lerman in addition to US hosts such as the Yale School of Dramahttp://drama.yale.edu/facstaff/liz-lerman and the Tisch School for the Arts.http://tisch.nyu.edu/tisch-research-news-events/research- at-tisch/strategies/events-and-publications/liz-lerman-guest-visit CRP facilitator-cohorts are in development in Scotland http://www.puppetanimation.org/content/page.php?page_id=18\u2282_id=29 and in Baltimore, Maryland.http://www.baltimoreculture.org/programs/professional- development-training/critical-response-process-crp#.Vze7Itc7E7A In 2014 Yorkshire Dance developed a beta-version of an online-adaptation of CRP, called \"respond.\"http://www.respondto.org/#home Lerman conducts residencies on the Critical Response Process, creative research, the intersection of art and science, and the building of narrative within dance performance at such institutions as Harvard University, Yale School of Drama, Wesleyan University, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the National Theatre Studio among many others. In 2020, Wesleyan University Press will publish Lerman\u2019s second book on CRP, called \u201cCritique is Creative,\u201d written with John Borstel and including essays by CRP practitioners from around the world. ==Awards== * 2017 Jacob's Pillow Dance Award *2015 American Dance Guild Lifetime Achievement Award * 2014 Dance/USA Honor Award * 2011 United States Artists Fellow * 2002 MacArthur Fellows Program * 2009 Jack P.
