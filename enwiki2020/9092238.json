The presidential seal returned to usage in the wake of the fourth republic in 1999, and it has remained in use since. ==See also== *Coat of Arms of Nigeria *Nigerian heraldry *Seal of the Vice- President of Nigeria ==References== * National Symbols of Nigeria * Nigeria: President's New Helicopter May Be Rekitted Nigeria President of Nigeria, Seal of the Category:Government of Nigeria Category:Birds in art Category:Horses in art ",
