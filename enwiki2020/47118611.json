The commercial version also supports previewing some camera RAW formats for which a WIC-enabled codec exists. Such RAW codecs are currently available from Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Sony and for Adobe DNG. * Many applications on Mac OS X use either the Core Image or QuickTime APIs for image support. This enables reading and writing to a variety of formats, including JPEG, JPEG2000, Apple Icon Image format, TIFF, PNG, PDF, BMP and more. * SView5 may also run on Linux/x86 and MacOS/x86 using Mono. ==References== Image viewers ",
