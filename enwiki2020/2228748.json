He was born in the northern Honduran department of Santa B\u00e1rbara on 3 June 1849 to Saturnino Bogr\u00e1n Bonilla and Gertrudis Barahona Leiva. He was a member of a prominent and wealthy political family. The last name \"Bogr\u00e1n\" derives from the French surname \"Beaugrand\". Luis Bogr\u00e1n was half-brother and first cousin of future president Francisco Bogr\u00e1n (5 October 1919 - 1 February 1920) and first cousin of future president Miguel Paz Barahona (1 February 1925 - 1 February 1929). ==Background== After successfully completing his secondary school studies in his home town, a young Luis Bogr\u00e1n pursued a law degree at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, and later pursued a career in the military. Bogr\u00e1n reached the rank of General within a few years, after successful military campaigns against Salvadoran military adversaries attempting to infiltrate national territory. He married Teresa Morejon Ferrera in 1878. Soon after, he became involved in politics, and later became ex-president Marco Aurelio Soto's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. His two consecutive terms as president were considered to be very prosperous for the nation. He is known for greatly expanding the educational system by establishing a number of learning institutions around the country, attracting considerable foreign investment (especially into the agricultural sector), improving the infrastructure of the capital city, and encouraging research and investigation of the ancient Mayan city of Cop\u00e1n. As a strong supporter of Francisco Moraz\u00e1n's ideal, President Bogr\u00e1n was a unionist and attempted to bring about, with the help of then Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios, the unification of the five Central American states. Ultimately, the unionist agenda was defeated as the ultra-conservative power elites in these states successfully thwarted unification attempts. Luis Bogr\u00e1n died in Guatemala city, Guatemala on 9 July 1895. == Luis Bogr\u00e1n as President of the Republic of Honduras == Luis Bogr\u00e1n is renowned in Honduras for greatly expanding the educational system throughout the major cities and towns of Honduras. He founded the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (National School of Arts), the Academia Cient\u00edfico-Literario (Literary-Scientific Academy), and the Tipografia Nacional (National Typography/Press). He also attracted substantial foreign investment, especially into the agricultural arena, which resulted in job creation and economic development of the northern coast. He improved the infrastructure of the capital city, Tegucigalpa. President Luis Bogr\u00e1n also initiated the process of research and investigation in the ruins of the ancient Mayan city of Copan by inviting foreign universities to study the artifacts and architecture left behind by the Mayans. He was also one of the founding members of the Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH (National Party of Honduras). ==External links== * brief biography on HRN (Honduran National Radio) website.
