    "text": "The Navagraha Kritis are a set of 9 songs composed by Muttusw\u0101mi D\u012bkshitar, a great composer of Carn\u0101tic Music (Classical music of South India). Each song is a prayer to one of the nine Navagrah\u0101s (\"planets\" of Hindu mythology). The songs titles, r\u0101ga (musical scale) and t\u0101\u1e37a (rhythmic pattern) are listed below: * S\u016bryam\u016brt\u0113 Nam\u014dstut\u0113 (on Sun or Surya, in R\u0101ga Saur\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dram, T\u0101\u1e37a Chatusra Dhr\u016bva) * Chandram Bhaja M\u0101nasa (on Moon or Chandra, in R\u0101ga As\u0101v\u0113ri, T\u0101\u1e37a Chatusra Ma\u1e6dya) * Ang\u0101rakam \u0100shray\u0101myaham (on Mars or Ang\u0101raka, in R\u0101ga Sura\u1e6di, T\u0101\u1e37a R\u016bpaka) * Budham \u0100shray\u0101mi (on Mercury or Budha, in Raga N\u0101\u1e6dakuranji, T\u0101\u1e37a Misra Jhampa) * B\u1e5bhaspat\u0113 T\u0101r\u0101pat\u0113 (on Jupiter or B\u1e5bhaspati, in R\u0101ga A\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101, T\u0101\u1e37a Tisra Tripu\u1e6da) * Shr\u012b Shukra Bhagavantam (on Venus or Shukra, in R\u0101ga Paraju, T\u0101\u1e37a Khanda A\u1e6da) * Div\u0101karatanujam Shanaishcharam (on Saturn or Shani, in R\u0101ga Yadukulak\u0101mbh\u014dji, T\u0101\u1e37a Chatusra \u0112ka) * Smar\u0101myaham Sad\u0101 R\u0101hum (on R\u0101hu, in R\u0101ga R\u0101mapriya (R\u0101maman\u014dhari), T\u0101\u1e37a R\u016bpaka) * Mah\u0101suram K\u0113tumaham (on K\u0113tu, in R\u0101ga Shanmukhapriya (Ch\u0101maram), T\u0101\u1e37a R\u016bpaka) The set comprises all seven sool\u0101di t\u0101\u1e37as. The last two (on R\u0101hu and K\u0113tu) were most likely composed by followers of D\u012bkshitar, to complete the set of nine even though the signature used in the song is that of Dikshitar (guruguha). Legend: It is said that Tambiappan, a disciple of Muttusw\u0101mi D\u012bkshitar was suffering from a stomach ailment and for long no medicines were able to cure him. D\u012bkshitar inspecting his horoscope inferred that the planet Jupiter was in an unfavorable position and his ailment could be cured only by propitiating the planet god B\u1e5bhaspati. As laymen would find these rituals complex he created the composition B\u1e5bhaspat\u0113 in the R\u0101ga A\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101 propitiating the planet, and asked his disciple to sing it for a week. As ordained, his ailment was cured. This incident provided the impetus for D\u012bkshitar to compose kritis on all the Navagrah\u0101s. ==References== *Dikshitar's Navagraha (Nine Planets) at medieval.org Category:Carnatic music Category:Navagraha ",
