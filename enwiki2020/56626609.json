Over the ice cap, it is bordered in the east by the Sermersooq municipality, however this border runs north-south (45\u00b0 West meridian) through the center of the Greenland ice sheet (), and as such is free of traffic. Communities of Qeqertalik encircle Disko Bay, an inlet of the larger Baffin Bay, while the northeastern shores and Nuussuaq Peninsula belong to the neighboring municipality of Avannaata. ==Politics== Qeqertalik's municipal council consists of 15 members, elected every four years.
