    "text": "Lance Dodes is an American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst best known for his theory that all addictions are psychological compulsions. == Biography == Dr. Dodes received an A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1966, his D.M.S. from Dartmouth in 1966, and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1970. He is a Training and Supervising Analyst Emeritus of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and a retired Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. == Work on addiction == Prior to Dr. Dodes' work, psychological theories about addiction separated them from other common psychological symptoms. Dr. Dodes was first to recognize that addictions are identical to the symptoms we call compulsions, a view that allows for understanding and treating addictions the same way as other compulsive symptoms. In his book The Heart of Addiction and a series of peer-reviewed academic articles, Dodes showed that addiction is a symptom that reflects a need to reverse overwhelming feelings of helplessness. His second book, Breaking Addiction: A 7-Step Handbook for Ending Any Addiction was honored as a Library Journal Best Book in its category. In The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry, Dodes and his co- author reviewed 50 years of research and reported that most people who have experienced Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) have not achieved long-term sobriety, and only five to eight percent of the people who go to one or more AA meetings achieve sobriety for longer than one year. Gabrielle Glaser used Dodes' figures to state that AA has a low success rate in a 2015 article for The Atlantic, which says that better alternatives than AA for alcohol treatment are available. The 5\u20138% figure put forward by Dodes is controversial; Thomas Beresford, M.D., says that the book uses \"three separate, questionable, calculations that arrive at the 5\u20138% figure.\" == Other works == In 2004 Dodes appeared in an episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit! In 2015 he appeared as an expert in the film \"The Business of Recovery\". He contributed an essay to the 2017 book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump. == Honors == In 2001, Dodes was honored by the Division on Addictions at Harvard Medical School for \u201cDistinguished Contribution\u201d to the study and treatment of addictive behavior. In 2009, Dodes was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry. Dodes was awarded an Author Prize by Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing for being in the top 5% of authors in 2011 and has remained in the top 5% through 2018 (the last year for which there are figures). == External Links == * Lance M.
