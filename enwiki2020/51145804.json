Amar's slip-grip methods and his clumsy antics earned him the nickname Butterfingers. Butterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa's son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in Tinkle, a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai-based illustrator and graphic artist. The popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, Howzzat Butterfingers! , In 2010. This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by Goal, Butterfingers!, a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme. The third in the series, \u2018Clean Bowled, Butterfingers! was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called \u2018Crack It\u2019 when the school\u2019s cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun. The Misadventures of Butterfingers, the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories. It was followed by two collections of delightful short stories, Run! It's Butterfingers Again! in 2017 and Of Course It's Butterfingers! in 2018. The books have received praise from different quarters. The late Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, former Indian cricket captain and legend, wrote of Howzzat Butterfingers!: \u2018What great fun! It brings back memories of my prep school days.\u2019 The ace cricketer V.V.S. Laxman described Clean Bowled Butterfingers as an \u2018exuberant mix of school, cricket and fun.\u2019 Shashi Tharoor, writer, MP and diplomat, complimented Khyrunnisa \u2018not just for creating Butterfingers, but for enriching Indian writing with world-class children\u2019s literature.\u2019 He also said that \u2018Khyrunnisa's Butterfingers is a gift to the children of our nation!' == Bibliography == === Children's Books === ====Butterfingers==== *Of Course It\u2019s Butterfingers!
