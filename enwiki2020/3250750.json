    "text": "The Royal Galician Academy (, RAG) is an institution dedicated to the study of Galician culture and especially the Galician language; it promulgates norms of grammar, spelling, and vocabulary and works to promote the language. The Academy is based in A Coru\u00f1a, Galicia, Spain. The current president is V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez Freixanes. == History == In 1905 the Galician language was persecuted in Spain. To avoid persecution, the Sociedade Protectora da Academia Gallega was founded in La Habana, Cuba. Then on September 30, 1906, thanks to the efforts of writers Manuel Curros Enr\u00edquez and Xos\u00e9 Fontenla Leal, it was reestablished as the Real Academia Galega. Manuel Murgu\u00eda was its first president. In 1972 the Academy standardized the design of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Galicia. Some years later, the Academy persuaded the Galician government to commemorate the old coat of arms by superimposing it on the existing civil flag; the resulting flag is used today. Its terminological branch is Termigal. == Current members == * Xos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds M\u00e9ndez Ferr\u00edn * Xes\u00fas Ferro Ruibal * Margarita Ledo Andi\u00f3n * Manuel Rivas * Xes\u00fas Alonso Montero * V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez Freixanes * Henrique Monteagudo * Marilar Aleixandre * Rosario \u00c1lvarez Blanco * Fina Casalderrey * Anton Santamarina * Xohana Torres * Ram\u00f3n Villares * Luz Pozo Garza * Pegerto Saavedra * Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Gonz\u00e1lez == Criticism == The group Galician Writers Association (AELG) criticises the Royal Academy's official language spelling rules and campaigns for an orthographic reintegration reunifying Galician's spelling rules with those of Portuguese. The spelling reintegration campaign held by the AGL is not supported by any of the Galician parties, who along with the Royal Academy adhere to state ideology, represented in the Galician parliament. == External links == * Category:Galician language Category:Language regulators Category:1905 establishments in Cuba ",
