It lay on the southern side of the island facing the Menai Strait which separates Anglesey from the mainland. There are indications that Rhosyr existed as far back as the 6th century and the period of St Caffo and King Maelgwn Gwynedd. The cantref stretched inland from the Menai Strait to the tidal Maltreath estuary, controlling the dry land route through Anglesey, hence held a strategic position.Rhosyr: Its History and Topography in the Age of the Welsh Princes, pp. 8-10 The township of Rhosyr, in the south of the cantref, was of military importance for controlling access to the Menai Strait.
