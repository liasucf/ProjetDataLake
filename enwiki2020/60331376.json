    "text": "Harry Hooper, the all-time leader in fielding errors as a right fielder. In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9. Harry Hooper is the all-time leader in errors committed by a right fielder with 143 career. Dave Parker is second all-time with 134 career errors at right field. Only fourteen right fielders have committed more than 100 career errors at the position. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" | Rank || Rank amongst leaders in career errors committed.
