    "text": "NAI2O Official Seal The National Aviation Intelligence Integration Office (NAI2O) is the lead organization for coordinating and integrating the United States Government's (USG) Intelligence Community (IC) perspective on civil aviation issues. NAI20 brings together the Global Aviation Community Of Interest (GACOI) to improve civil aviation safety and security through communication and intelligence/information sharing in order to produce integrated and actionable aviation intelligence. The concept of the NAI2O originated in the findings of The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as The 9/11 Commission), The Intelligence Reform and Terror Prevention Act (IRTPA), Presidential directives, and additional USG and IC aviation security plans. The goal is to support national policy and decision makers on aviation issues and perform actions as directed by The Office of the Director of National Intelligence's (ODNI) Strategic Guidance. NAI2O accomplishes this, in part by orchestrating Inter-Agency (IA) & IC collaboration on the collection & production of all relevant and appropriate information required to fully inform USG leaders, thus enabling clear & concise policy and resource decisions to be made in an efficient manner. ==Partners== Collaboration is the key to the focusing efforts. Current partners include: * Federal Agencies *State Agencies * Representatives from the private aviation industry and academia * International partners ==Location== NAI2O is located in Southeast Washington, DC on Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB). ==Related Links== National Strategy for Aviation Security Remarks as delivered by The Honorable James R.
