Her crew will be drawn from the Samoan Police Force. Australia supplied 22 s to 12 of its smaller Pacific Forum allies when the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea established that maritime nations controlled an economic exclusion zone off their coasts. ==Design== Australia designed the vessels to use commercial off the shelf components, rather than cutting edge military grade components, to make it easier to maintain the vessels in small, isolated shipyards. The vessels will have a maximum speed of , and to have a complement of approximately 20 crewmembers. They will be able to launch and retrieve a pursuit boat from a stern launching ramp without requiring bringing the vessel to a halt. On April 2, 2019, Police Commissioner Fuiavailili Egon Keil hinted that keeping her crew safe might require installing a deck gun. Australia designed the vessels to be capable of mounting secondary machine guns, and a primary weapon of up to in calibre. Australia delivers the vessels complete, except for armament, and the original Nafanua and her sister ships were armed only with small arms. Nafanua II will be the first Samoan patrol vessel with a mixed gender crew. ==Operational history== Manufacturer Austal handed Nafanua II over to Samoan representatives at its plant in Henderson, Western Australia, on August 16, 2019. Present at the handover ceremony, representing Samoa, were Fiame Naomi Mata\u2019afa, and Fuivaili\u2019ili Egon Keil, Samoa's Deputy Prime Minister and Commissioner of Police. Representing Australia were Linda Reynolds and Melissa Price, Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Industry. Samoa agreed that Nafanua II would cooperate under the Niue Treaty Subsidiary Agreement to conduct fishery surveillance as it transitted Australian waters, on its first voyage to Samoa, even though she had yet to be officially commissioned. Nafanua II arrived in Apia on October 4, 2019. ==References== Category:2019 ships Category:Ships of Samoa ",
