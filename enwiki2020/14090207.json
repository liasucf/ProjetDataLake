Cy Williams led the team in home runs with 24. == Offseason == * December 15, 1923: Cotton Tierney was traded by the Phillies to the Boston Braves for Hod Ford and Ray Powell. Powell refused to report to his new team. The Braves sent cash to the Phillies as compensation.Cotton Tierney page at Baseball Reference == Regular season == On August 21, 1924, the Phillies were traveling from games in St. Louis to Cincinnati when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train on which they were traveling turned over in the train yards in Mitchell, Indiana. Phillies players and personnel were unharmed but the engineer and fireman were killed in the accident. In the season's final series against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand was offered $500 by Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell to throw the games. The Giants were battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Robins. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the life-time suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of Famers Frankie Frisch, George Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated. === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #0f437c; color: white; text-align: center;\" | 1924 Philadelphia Phillies roster |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #af0039; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster |- | valign=\"top\" | Pitchers * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Catchers * * * Infielders * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" |Outfielders * * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Manager * Coaches * |} == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pos ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | 2B || || 145 || 530 || 144 || .272 || 3 || 53 |- align=\"center\" | SS || || 137 || 539 || 132 || .245 || 6 || 40 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 148 || 558 || 183 || .328 || 24 || 93 |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Other batters ==== Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" |} === Pitching === ==== Starting pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Other pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 37 || 144.1 || 7 || 10 || 4.30 || 46 |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Relief pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 7 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 6.48 || 3 |- align=\"center\" |} ==References== ==External links == *1924 Philadelphia Phillies season at Baseball Reference Category:Philadelphia Phillies seasons Philadelphia Phillies season Philly ",
