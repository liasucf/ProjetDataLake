(The latter would marry Inez Geneva Trueman.) In 1908, he moved to Winnipeg where he continued to practice law. In 1915, he drafted the Referendum and Initiative Act, which would have made popular plebiscites legal. The act would be referred to the Court of King's Bench for a ruling on whether the Government of Manitoba had jurisdiction to enact such an act. It was subsequently decided that the government had such authority. However, the Manitoba Court of Appeal would subsequently overrule the lower court's decision. The matter was taken directly to the Privy Council on special leave, bypassing the Supreme Court, where it was held in 1919 that the Manitoba government had no such right. In 1916, he was made King's Counsel. Following the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, he defended William Ivens and John Queen, two leading figures in the strike who were accused of seditious libel and conspiracy. In his jury address, he is reported to have said \"you cannot indict ideas\". Both men would be convicted in 1920.
