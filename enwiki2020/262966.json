    "text": "Brendan Corish (19 November 1918 \u2013 17 February 1990) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Health from 1973 to 1977, Leader of the Labour Party, Minister for Social Welfare from 1954 to 1957 and from 1973 to 1977, Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of Defence and Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of Local Government from 1948 to 1951. He was a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1948 to 1982. ==Early and personal life== He was born in Wexford town. His father, Richard Corish, a well-known trade union official and Sinn F\u00e9in member, had been elected to the Second D\u00e1il shortly after the birth of his son and later joined the Labour Party, serving as a local and national politician until his death in 1945. He was educated locally at Wexford CBS and, in his youth, was a member of the 1st Wexford Scout troop (Scouting Ireland). At the age of nineteen, he joined the clerical staff of Wexford County Council. He was married to Phyllis, and they had three sons. ==Political career== Corish was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Labour Party candidate in the Wexford by-election in 1945, necessitated by the death of his father who was the sitting TD. He took a seat on the fractured opposition benches, as Fianna F\u00e1il's grip on power continued. He retained his seat at the 1948 general election in which Fianna F\u00e1il was returned as the largest party in the D\u00e1il once again. However, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the National Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and a number of Independent candidates all came together to form the first inter-party government. Corish was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Defence and Local Government. When the Second Inter-party Government was formed after the 1954 general election, Corish was appointed Minister for Social Welfare. In 1960 Corish succeeded William Norton as Labour Party leader. He introduced new policies which made the party more socialist in outlook and described the party program as Christian socialist. However, the party moved carefully because 'socialism' was still considered a dirty word in 1960s Ireland. Corish claimed that Ireland would be 'Socialist in the Seventies'. To a certain extent he was right because Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a coalition government between 1973 and 1977.The Dynamics of Irish Politics (1989) page 85 Corish became T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare. In 1977, the Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave called a general election, and Fianna F\u00e1il was returned to power in a landslide victory. Corish resigned as leader of the Labour Party, having signalled his intent to do so before the election. He was succeeded as party leader by Frank Cluskey. Corish retired from politics completely at the February 1982 general election. ==Death== Brendan Corish died on 17 February 1990 in Wexford at the age of 71. ==Works== *The New Republic (February 1968) ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Leaders of the Labour Party (Ireland) Category:Members of the 12th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Ministers for Health (Ireland) Category:Ministers for Social Affairs (Ireland) Category:Parliamentary Secretaries of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Politicians from County Wexford Category:Presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland) Category:T\u00e1naist\u00ed Category:People from Wexford, County Wexford ",
