    "text": "Beyond a Steel Sky is a 2020 cyberpunk science fiction adventure game developed by Revolution Software. It is a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky, a point-and-click adventure game created in 1994. Set ten years after the events of the first game, the protagonist Robert Foster returns to Union City. Revolution Studios CEO Charles Cecil has said that the game examines how an AI would interpret a prime directive to make people happy. Beyond a Steel Sky was developed using Unreal Engine 4. It was released on 26 June 2020 on the Apple Arcade subscription service, and on July 16, 2020 on Steam. == Reception == Dark Station praised the game: \"Beyond a Steel Sky is in many ways respectful of genre traditions but with modern wisdom and presentation. The game can be enjoyed without prior knowledge of Beneath a Steel Sky but obviously, it has a lot of gentle nods to its predecessor.\" GameWatcher wrote that the game \"has big shoes to fill [and] not only fills that shoe, but it knocks the definition of a modern adventure game out of the park. It does everything Telltale games do right, and corrects everything they do wrong.\" GameGrin described it as \"a fantastic adventure with some at-times brain bending puzzles that stays remarkably true to the original game. Some minor technical issues mar the experience slightly but it\u2019s a great return for Foster and Joey.\" PC Invasion wrote that \"Beyond a Steel Sky has some technical issues but its excellent writing and interesting storytelling make it well worth experiencing.\" Godisageek similarly wrote that \"the humour and mystery are enough to carry Beyond A Steel Sky through, and if you did play the original and you do remember it, there\u2019s just enough nostalgia here to make it worth a return to Union City. If you didn\u2019t, well, it\u2019s still a likeable, competent adventure game that will keep you smiling and guessing throughout.\" ==References== Category:2020 video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Single-player video games Category:Adventure games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Dystopian video games Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games ",
