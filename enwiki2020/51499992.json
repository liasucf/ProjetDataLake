    "text": "is a Japanese multimedia project co-developed by ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine, music label Lantis, and animation studio Sunrise. The project is the second series of Love Live! franchise and is the spin-off sequel of the original Love Live!. The story of this project revolves around a new group of nine schoolgirls who become idols in order to save their school from shutting down. It launched in April 2015 with music CDs and anime music videos, followed by a manga version in 2016. An anime television series was directed by Kazuo Sakai at Sunrise; the first season aired between July and September 2016 while the second season aired between October and December 2017. Both seasons are licensed in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand by Funimation, Anime Limited and Madman Entertainment, respectively. An anime film titled Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow was released on January 4, 2019 in Japanese theaters. ==Plot== Love Live Sunshine!! is set in Uchiura, Numazu, Shizuoka where one of its schools, the seaside Uranohoshi Girls' Academy, is planned to be shut down and merged with another school in Numazu. Chika Takami, a girl who lacks desires, is inspired by \u03bc's (pronounced \"muse\") to gather friends and form her own school idol group called . To prevent their school from shutting down, Aqours enters the \"Love Live\" school idol contest which has become more competitive since \u03bc's won. ==Characters== Where appropriate, plot descriptions mentioned below refer to the anime television series. Other parts of the franchise, such as the manga and novel series, feature some variations in the storyline. ===Aqours=== ; : :Chika is a second-year student at Uranohoshi Girls' Academy. Always claiming herself to be too ordinary, she finds that the girls of \u03bc's manage to \"shine\" brightly despite being normal students. This leads her to form a school idol group, with her determination compounded by the fact that her school is facing the crisis of education reform (consolidation with another school, with Uranohoshi's students moving to the other campus). The youngest among three daughters, her family runs a traditional inn known for its open-air hot springs with an ocean view. Sometimes Chika loves to insert terrible puns between her words, even explaining them. She acts as Aqours' leader and primary lyricist. ; : :You is an energetic second-year student with a positive outlook. You is Chika's childhood friend and also aims to one day become a ship captain, just like her father. Her catchphrase is , also known as \"Aye-aye!\" in the English dub. She loves uniforms, whether they are idol costumes or work-related uniforms like police or shrine maiden outfits. Due to this, she is the main costume coordinator of the group. ; : :Riko is a modest, down-to-earth second-year transfer student from Akihabara's Otonokizaka Girls' Academy. She is a talented young pianist, but felt that she had stopped improving, and moved to Numazu to take inspiration from the sea. She is also a capable violist. She has a fear of dogs, which is not helped by the fact that the Takami family's dog, Shiitake, seems to take an interest in her. She eventually gets over her fear of dogs to the point that she now loves them, and adopts her own puppy by the end of the series. She is also revealed to have an interest in various sh\u014djo and yuri manga, often buying collections on her brief returns to Tokyo. After joining Aqours, she becomes the composer of the group. ; : :A third-year student and Chika's childhood friend. Kanan lives alone with her grandfather on a nearby island where they run a diving gear shop. She is introduced as having taken a leave of absence from school, as she must take care of the shop alone while her father recovers from a fractured bone. She, Dia, and Mari are childhood friends who formed a school idol group in their first year named Aqours, but disbanded quickly, leading the three to separate. Kanan is responsible for their first disbandment, feigning stage fright to treat Mari's sprained leg and to convince her to pursue her studies abroad, all of which were kept secret by her and Dia. Kanan is the most athletic member of the group and acts as their main choreographer. ; : :Mari is a third-year student at Uranohoshi. Her Italian-American father runs a hotel chain and in Japan, she lives in one of their hotels. Mari is a bright person who prefers to take action by herself, and does not feel herself to be suited to become a school idol. Her favorite music genre is industrial metal. Due to her background, Mari speaks in an English accent and often mixes English and Japanese (Italian in the English dub) in her speech. Mari's family is one of the main sponsors of Uranohoshi, to the point of having her appointed as the school's chairman despite being one of the students. She was friends with Dia and Kanan, having even formed their own idol unit in the past that was disbanded some time later due to Kanan and Dia wanting her to pursue the scholarship she got at a school overseas. Her catchphrase is , which she tends to exclaim whenever she gets excited. ; : :The prideful, third-year student council president of Uranohoshi Girls' Academy. She and her younger sister Ruby are part of a well-known and respected family. Dia also is a diehard fan of \u03bc's and after she, Kanan, and Mari separated, she had been hiding her enthusiasm about school idols until she is convinced to join Aqours by Chika and the others. She is the origin of Aqours' name, passing it on to Chika's group from when she, Kanan, and Mari were school idols. She scolds and corrects the other members with her catchphrase , the Japanese onomatopoeia for an incorrect buzzer. ; : :Hanamaru is an easily distracted first-year student whose family runs a local temple without several modern-age utilities such as computers and hand dryers. Because of this, she becomes enamored upon seeing them, much to the surprise of others. She refers to herself as either \"ora\" or \"Maru\", and ends many of her sentences with \"-zura\" because of her Shizuoka dialect. She is also a member of a local choir due to her talent at singing. Before joining Aqours, she is an avid reader at the school's library. She and Yoshiko were friends during kindergarten, and Yoshiko calls her \"Zuramaru\". ; : :Ruby is a first-year Uranohoshi student as well as Dia's timid younger sister, who has long since dreamed of becoming an idol. She has androphobia (a fear of men), as she has never talked to anyone male outside of her own father. In the anime, her shyness is increased so she enters in panic when she is touched by anyone she is not used to regardless of sex, being only comfortable around Dia and Hanamaru at the start of the anime. Her catchphrase is , which is officially translated as \"Do your Rubesty!\" ; : :Yoshiko is a first-year student who tries to erase her ch\u016bniby\u014d and attend high school like a normal student. She refers to herself as , claiming that she was a fallen angel for having angered God, and wants everyone to call her that (though nobody actually calls her that). The reason why she became a ch\u016bniby\u014d is because she feels like she is too ordinary, as her Yohane identity makes up her entire personality. After joining Aqours, she decides to keep her ch\u016bniby\u014d antics instead. ===Others=== * \u2013 One of the members of the idol duo Saint Snow, a rival of Aqours. * \u2013 Sarah's sister and partner in Saint Snow. She and her sister were inspired by A-Rise to become school idols in a similar fashion that the members of Aqours are inspired by \u03bc's. * \u2013 Chika's eldest sister. * \u2013 Chika's older sister and the middle child of Takami family. ==Media== ===Print=== A manga titled Love Live!

He was critical of the overall plot reusing story elements from the original series but said it was utilized very well in making its \"genuinely imperfect\" main cast relatable and having a more \"emotionally resonant\" adventure than its predecessor. Creamer wrote that director Kazuo Sakai did an admirable job maintaining the series' visual comedy previously helmed by Takahiko Ky\u014dgoku, giving each character a distinct and expressive trait from one another and improved the CG dance models and scenes to be more eye-pleasing and presentable than before, concluding that, \"Simultaneously too similar and extremely different, suffering many of the same failings but rising to its own dramatic heights, Sunshine is ultimately a rewarding show and a fine followup for the Love Live! franchise.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Official worldwide website * Category:2016 anime television series Category:Animated musical groups Category:Anime spin-offs Category:ASCII Media Works manga Category:Bandai Namco franchises Category:Dengeki G's Magazine Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Funimation Category:Japanese idols in anime and manga Category:Japanese musical groups Category:Lantis (company) Category:Love Live!
