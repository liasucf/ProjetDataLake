It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. == History == Old Guildford and Guildford were named after the Earl of Guildford. ===Aboriginal culture=== Prior to colonisation, the Dharug people lived in small groups across the Cumberland Plain, including in the area which is now the Woodville Ward. The Bidjigal clan lived around the area which is now Guildford. ===European settlement=== Lieutenant Samuel North was granted here in 1837 and named his property Guildford, as he had ties with the Earl of Guildford. Although the name of the property changed to Orchardleigh in 1843 when it was sold by North, the name Guildford stuck to the region and the small hamlet which developed in the area around Woodville Road. In 1869 a school had opened and a church was built in the 1880s.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia In 1876, a railway station was built on the line some distance to the north of the village and named Guildford because it was the closest settlement to the station.
