    "text": "The third season of Greece's Next Top Model (abbreviated as GNTMgr) premiered on September 10, 2018 and was the first season to air on Star Channel. Vicky Kaya returned as the host of the show, while the judging panel consisted of model Iliana Papageorgiou, fashion designer Angelos Bratis and noted photographer Dimitris Skoulos. The prizes for this season included a modelling contract with PLACE models in Hamburg, a cover and spread with InStyle magazine, a contract with Dust & Cream cosmetics, and a cash prize of \u20ac50,000. Approximately 3000 girls applied for the show. 1500 girls were invited to the audition rounds. 50 girls were then selected to enter the Bootcamp. Originally, 25 girls were chosen to be contestants in this season. However, one girl decided to quit before the first photoshoot took place, and two others were eliminated right before entering the model house, narrowing down the final number of contestants to 22. The winner of the competition was the 21-year old Eirini Noune Kazaryan. ==Cast== ===Contestants=== (Ages stated are at start of contest) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; !Contestant !Age !Height !Hometown !Finish !Place |- |Sofia Zachariadou |23 | |Thessaloniki |rowspan=\"2\"|Episode 9 |22 |- |Jo Desylla |19 | |Athens |21 |- |Katerina Visseri |24 | |Serres |Episode 12 |20 |- |Marianna Mantesi |18 | |Athens |Episode 14 |19 |- |Garifallia Kalifoni |22 | |Agrinio |rowspan=\"2\"|Episode 15 |18 (quit) |- |Elena Kalliontzi |21 | |Heraklion |17 |- |Meggy Ndrio |25 | |Thessaloniki |Episode 16 |16 |- |Rozana Koutsoukou |21 | |Mykonos |Episode 17 |15 |- |Eirini Sterianou |23 | |Lesbos |Episode 18 |14 |- |Ioanna Sarri |21 | |Athens |Episode 19 |13 |- |Christianna Skoura |22 | |Heraklion |Episode 21 |12 |- |Xanthi Jerefou |20 | |Pireaus |rowspan=2 |Episode 22 |11 (quit) |- |Agapi Olagbegi |20 | |Athens |10 |- |Mikaela Fotiadis |24 | |Athens |Episode 23 |9 |- |Anna Tsakouridou |23 | |Larissa |Episode 24 |8 |- |Eirini Ermidou |19 | |Komotini | rowspan=\"2\"|Episode 25 |7 |- |Elda Laska |22 | |Heraklion |6 |- |Evi Ioannidou |22 | |Veroia |Episode 26 |5 |- |Anna Amanatidou |21 | |Thessaloniki |Episode 27 |4 |- |Marianna Penessi |23 | |Athens |rowspan=3 \"| Episode 28 |3 |- |Evelina Skichko |20 | |Nicosia |2 |- |Eirini Noune Kazaryan |21 | |Athens |1 |- |} ===Judges=== * Vicky Kaya * Angelos Bratis * Iliana Papageorgiou * Dimitris Skoulos ===Other cast members=== * Elena Christopoulou \u2013 mentor * Genevieve Majari \u2013 art director == Episode summaries == ===Episodes 1\u20135: Auditions === The show kicked off with the audition phase. Auditions took place in three different cities: Athens, Thessaloniki and Heraklion. The auditions aired for the first five episodes of the show. During the auditions, the girls had a brief interview with the judges while they also walked in swimwear, if asked. In order to advance, they needed a \"yes\" from at least 3 of the judges. ===Episodes 6\u20137: Bootcamp=== During the bootcamp, the 70 girls that advanced from the auditions took part. The bootcamp took place in Lake Vouliagmeni and was divided in two parts; during the first part the girls had to pick a visor or a turban and pose for a photoshoot in their swimwear. Based on the photoshoot, 40 of the girls advanced to the second part of the bootcamp. For the second part of the bootcamp, the girls had to walk in a fashion runway for the Greek fashion designer Vassilis Zoulias. Based on the runway, 25 of the girls advanced to the house. * Featured photographer: Bill Georgoussis ===Episode 8: Polaroid & Sparkly In a Bathtub=== Original airdate: *Quit: Angelina Georgiou *Eliminated: Gina Chaniotaki and Vasiliki Karra *Top 3: Eirini Sterianou, Evi Ioannidou and Sofia Zachariadou *Best Photo: Sofia Zachariadou *Featured photographers: Akis Paraskevopoulos, Vasilis Topouslidis ===Episode 9: Underwater Orchids=== Original airdate: *Eliminated outside of judging panel: Sofia Zachariadou *First call-out: Anna Amanatidou *Bottom two: Ioanna \"Jo\" Desylla & Eirini Noune Kazarian *Eliminated: Ioanna \"Jo\" Desylla *Featured photographer: Katerina Tsatsani ===Episode 10: The Makeover=== Original airdate: ===Episode 11: Embrace Your New Look === Original airdate: *First call-out: Evelina Skichko *Bottom two: Agapi Olagbegi & Katerina Visseri *Eliminated: Agapi Olagbegi *Featured photographer: Thanassis Krikis ===Episode 12: Africa === Original airdate: *First call-out: Garifallia Kalifoni *Bottom two: Elda Laska & Katerina Visseri *Eliminated: Katerina Visseri *Featured photographer: Genevieve Majari ===Episode 13: Urban Superheroes === Original airdate: *First call-out: Elena Kalliontzi *Bottom two: Eirini-Ria Sterianou & Elda Laska *Eliminated: Elda Laska *Featured photographer: George Malekakis ===Episode 14: Awareness === Original airdate: *First call-out: Mikaela Fotiadis *Bottom two: Eirini Ermidou & Marianna Mandesi *Eliminated: Marianna Mandesi *Featured photographer: Ioanna \u0397adjiandreou ===Episode 15: Boys & Girls=== Original airdate: *Quit: Garifallia Kalifoni *First call-out: Evi Ioannidou *Bottom two: Elena Kalliontzi & Eirini Noune Kazarian *Eliminated: Elena Kalliontzi *Featured photographer: Freddie F. ===Episode 16: Runaway Bride=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Evelina Skichko & Eirini Ermidou *Bottom two: Meggy Ndrio & Rozana Koutsoukou *Eliminated: Meggy Ndrio *Featured photographer: Apostolis Koukousas ===Episode 17: Balance=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Marianna Penesi *Bottom two: Rozana Koutsoukou & Xanthi Jerefou *Eliminated: Rozana Koutsoukou *Featured photographer: Aggelos Potamianos ===Episode 18: Styling on a Rush=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Evi Ioannidou *Bottom two: Ioanna Sarri & Eirini-Ria Sterianou *Eliminated: Eirini-Ria Sterianou *Featured photographer: Nikos Mastoras ===Episode 19: Captivating Animals=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Eirini Noune Kazarian *Bottom two: Anna Amanatidou & Ioanna Sarri *Eliminated: Ioanna Sarri *Featured photographer: Panos Yiannakopoulos ===Episode 20: Extreme Masterchef=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Eirini Noune Kazarian *Bottom two: Mikaela Fotiadis & Anna Tsakouridou *Eliminated: Anna Tsakouridou *Featured photographer: Stefanos Papadopoulos ===Episode 21: Colours of Motherhood=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Anna Amanatidou *Bottom two: Christianna Skoura & Eirini Noune Kazarian *Eliminated: Christianna Skoura *Featured photographer: George Aggelis ===Episode 22: Dolls=== Original airdate: *Quit: Xanthi Jerefou *Returned: Agapi Olagbegi, Anna Tsakouridou & Elda Laska *First call-out: Elda Laska *Bottom two: Agapi Olagbegi & Mikaela Fotiadis *Eliminated: Agapi Olagbegi *Featured photographer: Vasilis Topouslidis ===Episode 23: Speed=== Original airdate: *Immune: Marianna Penesi *First call-out: Evelina Skichko *Bottom two: Mikaela Fotiadis & Evi Ioannidou *Eliminated: Mikaela Fotiadis *Featured photographer: Marios Gavoyiannis ===Episode 24: Androgynous=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Marianna Penesi *Bottom two: Anna Tsakouridou & Anna Amanatidou *Eliminated: Anna Tsakouridou *Featured photographer: Kosmas Koumianos ===Episode 25: Video Clip=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Anna Amanatidou *Bottom two: Elda Laska & Eirini Ermidou *Eliminated: Both ===Episode 26: Crystal Ball Magic=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Eirini Noune Kazarian *Bottom two: Anna Amanatidou & Evi Ioannidou *Eliminated: Evi Ioannidou *Featured photographer: Bill Georgoussis ===Episode 27: Winter Dynasty=== Original airdate: *First call-out: Evelina Skichko *Bottom two: Anna Amanatidou & Marianna Penesi *Eliminated: Anna Amanatidou *Featured photographer: Marina Vernicos ===Episode 28: Xmas Fashion Party - Final=== Original airdate: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !colspan=\"10\"|Scores |- !
