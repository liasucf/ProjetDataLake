It is produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani under Excel Entertainment banner and marked the debut of Reema Kagti as a director. The movie has six different parts in it. == Plot and characters == The story is about six couples, who are on their honeymoon with the Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. bus and their trials and tribulations during the four-day journey to Goa. The couples are: * Oscar Fernandes (Boman Irani) and his wife Naheed (Shabana Azmi) who have just recently married. They are middle age and the target of constant mocking from everyone else. However, they intend on having a great journey and not be bothered by their difficult pasts. This is their second marriage. Oscar's first wife committed suicide and Naheed's husband and two children died in a car accident. Oscar is Naheed's first husband's business partner. After a chance meeting with Oscar's estranged daughter in Goa, father and daughter mend their relationship. * Partho Sen (Kay Kay Menon) and Milly Sen (Raima Sen), a couple from a small town in Bengal. He is a serious man and she behaves as a traditional sari-wearing wife. Through an encounter with a bunch of thugs, Partho finds out his timid housewife holds a black belt in martial arts, as she defeats the crooks without breaking a sweat. * Madhu (Sandhya Mridul) and Bunty (Vikram Chatwal) have recently married. Their differences draw from the fact that he is an NRI (non-resident Indian), while she has lived in Mumbai, India, her entire life. Bunty is a closet homosexual and his parents want him to marry the daughter of a family friend. Out of anxiety he surfed the internet for a bride. He met Madhu online, came to India and married quickly. Madhu had a recently failed relationship with a man, whom she left after discovering that he had a wife and child already. She found Bunty and married quickly to forget that pain. * Pinky (Ameesha Patel) and Vicky (Karan Khanna), hailing from Delhi. They couldn't be more different, as Pinky is very extroverted and Vicky is the opposite. When Vicky meets Bunty for the first time, he develops romantic feelings for him but doesn't express them. * Hitesh (Ranvir Shorey) and Shilpa (Dia Mirza) are from Gujarat and have recently married. During the first half-hour, Shilpa runs away with her boyfriend, Jignesh (Arjun Rampal). They board the Honeymoon Travels bus returning to Mumbai, while escaping from contract killers sent by Shilpa's father. * Aspi (Abhay Deol) and Zara (Minissha Lamba) are seemingly the most perfect couple of them all: They've never fought. Unknown to each other, each is a superhero and has to go off at a moment's notice to help the people. When Zara questions the whereabouts of her husband when he is not to be found some nights, they fight for the first time.
