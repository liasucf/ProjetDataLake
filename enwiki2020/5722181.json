    "text": "Ryan Powell (born February 23, 1978 in West Carthage, New York) is a four-time All-American lacrosse player at Syracuse University and was on the US national team roster in 2006 and 2010. ==Background== Ryan did not begin playing organized lacrosse until he was in the seventh grade. He is the second oldest in the family behind his brother Casey Powell, and older than Michael Powell. Powell attended Carthage senior high school where he was the quarterback for the football team and played on the lacrosse team.\"New York's First Family of Lacrosse.\" Wall Street Journal. New York, July 21, 2010. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703724104575379392559619162.html. In 1996 Ryan chose to attend Syracuse University, following his brother Casey. At Syracuse, Ryan was a four-time All-American (his brother Casey was also a four-time All-American). After his college career he was drafted third in the 2000 MLL draft. He currently plays for the Boston Blazers of the National Lacrosse League (indoor lacrosse) and the Denver Outlaws of Major League Lacrosse (outdoor). His brothers Casey and Mike also have enjoyed successful lacrosse careers. Powell owns and operates both Rhino Lacrosse and Powell Lacrosse.\"Lake Placid: Ryan Powell Brings His Black Rhinos to Upstate New York.\" August 1st 2011. http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2011/08/01/lake-placid- ryan-powell-brings-his-black-rhinos-upstate-new-york. He was sponsored by Warrior Lacrosse with his brother Casey up until 2004-2005. After leaving Warrior, Ryan is now a prominent figure and representative for Brine Lacrosse. Still living in Oregon, Powell's entire income comes solely from lacrosse.\"Powell in Portland.\" April 14, 2006. http://www.e-lacrosse.com/2006tk3.html Ryan lives with his fianc\u00e9 Marlee and still is being an innovator of the game through education as opposed to playing, whether it is from the NLL, the MLL, or from the Powell Brother's Lacrosse Camps. ==Rhino Lacrosse== In 2005, Ryan founded Rhino lacrosse in Portland, Oregon. Powell handpicks Rhino\u2019s elite-level staff from among the best players and instructors in the game. Since the company was founded in 2005, the sport of lacrosse has grown rapidly nationally and has become more widespread throughout the West Coast. ==Professional career== ===MLL=== Powell has played in Major League Lacrosse since 2001. He played for the Rochester Rattlers from 2001 to 2005, and the San Francisco Dragons in 2006 and 2007. In 2001 Powell earned MVP for the 2001 MLL season. In 2006, Powell was awarded both the Major League Lacrosse Offensive Player of the Year Award and the MVP. He is the second lacrosse player to receive the MVP award twice, (John Grant Jr. did as well (NLL: '07, '12 MLL: '07, '08)). Prior to the 2008 MLL season, the San Francisco Dragons traded Powell to the Denver Outlaws in exchange for draft picks. He, Casey, and Mike all sat out for the 2009 MLL season, as they did not report to their respective teams by the contract deadline. This was Ryan's first season sitting out, while it was Casey's second, and Mike's third. ===NLL=== Powell also plays indoor lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League with the Boston Blazers. ==Statistics== ===NLL=== {| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"3\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"6\" | Regular Season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"6\" | Playoffs |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
