In her undergraduate senior thesis,Tabata Amaral de Pontes, The Politics of Education Reform in Brazilian Municipalities, Harvard University, March 2016 Amaral conducted an analysis of educational reforms in Brazilian municipalities, arguing that despite the expansion of access to education in Brazil over the past two decades, the quality of federal education remains lacking according to international standards.Paulo Saldan\u00e3 e Natalia Cancian, Estagnado, Brasil fica entre os piores do mundo em avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Folha de S.

The organisation crowd-sourced concerns about education among young people in Brazil, and then questioned candidates on those education-related issues during the 2016 Brazilian municipal elections, disseminating their responses widely on social media. In 2017, Amaral co-founded the organisation Acredito (meaning \"I believe\") with Felipe Ori\u00e1 and Jos\u00e9 Frederico Lyra Netto. The organisation promotes young progressive politicians who are seeking office for the first time, with a particular focus on increasing the diversity of federal deputies. ==Political career== ===2018 election=== During the 2018 general election, Amaral's campaign was mainly centered on education. She received the sixth highest vote total of any candidate in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, with 264,450 votes. She is a member of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT). ===Deputy=== Building on her background as an education activist, Amaral became a prominent education critic, and was credited with being partly responsible for the removal of Ricardo V\u00e9lez Rodr\u00edguez as the Minister of Education in the government of Jair Bolsonaro. She served on the Education Commission, the Commission for the Defense of Women's Rights, and as an alternate member of the Science and Technology, Communication and Informatics Commission. From February 20, 2019 until April 25, 2019, she was the vice-leader of the PDT Block, the electoral coalition of the PDT. From June until November of that year, she was the vice- leader of the PDT. Amaral voted for reforming the Brazilian security system, which would raise the retirement age; this was a major policy of Jair Bolsonaro's government, and the PDT opposed the reform. Amaral broke party lines together with 8 other deputies of the PDT to vote in favour of the reform, stating that the reforms would be beneficial for education in Brazil. For this she was temporarily suspended from the party. == Controversies == In July 2019, the magazines Veja and Exame revealed that Amaral hired her boyfriend, Daniel Alejandro Mart\u00ednez, to work on her 2018 election campaign. According to the Superior Electoral Court, Amaral spent 23,000 reais (at the time about 6,000 USD) from the public election fund to pay for these services, which were provided between August and October of 2018. Amaral's team did not present the results of the services provided by Mart\u00ednez. In another case, the Supreme Federal Court had previously ruled that hiring relatives or spouses with electoral funds is legal, but the practice has been widely condemned by journalists and commentators. Veja magazine asserted that it was hypocritical for Amaral to engage in this practice, since in a previous interview with the magazine she had taken the anti-corruption position that \"renewal in politics is not about changing the name of things or the face in power, but a change of practices\". ==Selected honours== *BBC 100 inspiring and influential women (2019) *Time 100 Next (2019) ==References== Category:Democratic Labour Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Women political scientists Category:Brazilian political scientists Category:Brazilian activists Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:21st-century Brazilian politicians Category:21st-century Brazilian women politicians Category:BBC 100 Women ",
