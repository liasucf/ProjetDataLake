    "text": "TCT Kids is the children's programming division of the Tri-State Christian Television network. The block of religious-themed children's-oriented shows airs Saturday mornings on TCT's primary network feed in order to meet its affiliates' and owned-and-operated stations' federally mandated educational programming requirements. TCT Kids also runs as a standalone feed from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time daily on its Web site. From 7:30 p.m. to 5 a.m., the TCT Kids feed runs public domain films and television series; the remaining time is occupied by young-Earth creationist Ken Ham's daily program Answers in Genesis and a simulcast of TCT's flagship program, TCT Today. The remaining stations carrying the standalone feed as a digital subchannel had discontinued it by fall 2017, when TCT signed an affiliation deal with the commercial network Light TV. ==Programming== *Adventures in Odyssey *Another Sommertime Adventure *Answers in Genesis *Arnie's Shack * Blaze and the Monster Machines *The Burnnie Show *Capt'n Chuckleberry *Creation's Creatures *Cowboy Dan *Adventures of Donkey Ollie *Dr. Wonder's Workshop *Faithville *Gina D's Kids Club *God Rocks! * Gospel Bill Show *Hooked on Science *ImagineLand *KICKS Club *Kids Like You *Kidz Network *Maralee Dawn *Miss Charity's Diner *Quigley's Village *Reptile Experience *Sarah's Stories *Super Simple Science Stuff * Swamp Critters *Tween You & Me *Wize Flix ==See also== *Smile of a Child ==External links== * *TCT Kids Broadcast Schedule *Tri-State Christian Television Category:Television programming blocks in the United States ",
