    "text": "Denarius of Gaius Naevius Balbus, 79 BC. The obverse depicts Venus, the patron goddess of Sulla, while Victoria drives a triga on the reverse, alluding to Sulla's victory games. The gens Naevia, occasionally written Navia, was a plebeian or patrician family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned at the time of the Second Punic War, but the first of the Naevii to obtain the consulship was Lucius Naevius Surdinus, in AD 30.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1135 (\"Naevia Gens\"). ==Origin== The nomen Naevius is generally regarded as a patronymic surname derived from the praenomen Gnaeus, indicating a birthmark.Chase, pp. 131, 153. Gnaeus and naevus, the usual form of the Latin word for a birthmark, were pronounced similarly, and a number of other Latin words could be spelled with either gn- or n-, such as gnatus and natus, \"born\".The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. natus or gnatus. ==Branches and cognomina== In the time of the Republic, the principal cognomina of the Naevii were Balbus and Matho. Balbus, a common surname, originally signified one who stammers.Chase, p. 110. Chase regarded Matho as a borrowing of the Greek \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd.Chase, p. 117. Cicero stated that it was pronounced Mato, and sometimes spelled without an 'h'.Cicero, De Oratore, 48. Other Naevii bore the surnames Crista, Pollio, and Turpio, while Capella and Surdinus are found on coins.Eckhel, vol. v, p. 259. Crista refers to a crest or plume;The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. crista. Pollio is thought to mean \"polisher\", and to refer to the occupation of polishing arms.Chase, p. 111.The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. polio, politus. Turpio describes someone ugly, deformed, or foul.The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. turpis. Capella refers to a she-goat, while Surdinus probably described someone who was deaf, hard of hearing, stubborn, or silent.The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. capella, surdus. ==Members== * Gnaeus Naevius, a poet and dramatist of the Old Latin period.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.
