He has become one of the biggest-selling self-published authors and is an advocate of independent publishing. == Work == === Writing === Croft has written more than twenty books, including the Knight & Culverhouse crime thrillers and Kempston Hardwick mysteries. He has hit the USA Today bestseller list twice, with the Kempston Hardwick box set and his 2015 psychological thriller Her Last Tomorrow. Although he had been writing and self-publishing professionally for five years when Her Last Tomorrow was released, it was this book that brought him international attention. He has also had several plays published with Lazy Bee Scripts. As an advocate of self-publishing, he has often spoken out about the negative sides of traditional publishing and in 2012 he responded angrily to Sue Grafton's comments that self-publishing was disrespectful and lazy. Grafton later apologised for her comments. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by the University of Bedfordshire in March 2018 \"in recognition of his outstanding services to literature\".https://www.beds.ac.uk/news/2018/march/graduations-continue-at- bedfordshire In 2020, he announced he was launching a new crime series set in Rutland. == Personal life == Adam Croft lives in Flitwick, Bedfordshire. == Bibliography == Knight & Culverhouse * Too Close for Comfort (2011) * Guilty as Sin (2011) * Jack Be Nimble (2015) * Rough Justice (2015) * In Too Deep (2016) * In the Name of the Father (2016) * With A Vengeance (2017) * Dead & Buried (2018) * In Plain Sight (2019) Rutland crime series * What Lies Beneath (2020) Kempston Hardwick Mysteries * Exit Stage Left (2011) * The Westerlea House Mystery (2013) * Death Under the Sun (2014) * The Thirteenth Room (2015) * The Wrong Man (2019) Psychological thrillers * Her Last Tomorrow (2015) * Only the Truth (2017) * In Her Image (2017) * Tell Me I'm Wrong (2018) * The Perfect Lie (2019) * Closer To You (2020) Sam Barker * Absolution (2019) * Betrayal (2020) Short Stories * Gone (2016) * Love You To Death (2017) * The Harder They Fall (2017) Plays * Sleeping Dogs (2014) * Curtain Up!
