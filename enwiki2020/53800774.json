An area of 2.8 hectares is managed as a nature reserve by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The wetland has tall plants such as lesser pond-sedge and slender tufted-sedge, which provides cover for reed buntings and sedge warblers. Mammals include otters, and there are birds such as red kites and buzzards. Purple loosestrife is found in grassland areas. There is access to the nature reserve by a footpath from Polwell Lane, but the rest of the site is private land with no public access. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northamptonshire Category:Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire reserves ",
