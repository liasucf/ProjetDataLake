Their records are distributed in Canada by Universal Music Group. 604 refers to one of the area codes of the Lower Mainland (which includes the City of Surrey, British Columbia, where the company's offices are located). Simkin launched the companion label Light Organ Records in 2010 to release music by a number of indie rock bands whom he felt did not fit with 604's image.\"Vancouver's Light Organ Records Moves Away from the Mainstream\". Exclaim!, November 25, 2010. In 2014, 604 Records relocated to a new larger office and opened 604 Studios, a multimedia production facility featuring two recording studios, soundstage and in-house production team. 604 Records has since used 604 Studios for a number of livestream broadcast events. ==Artists== * AJ Woodworth * Aaron Pritchett * Anami Vice * Armchair Cynics * Autumns Canon * ByStarlight * Carly Rae Jepsen * Cat Thomson * Coleman Hell * Dallas Smith * Daniel Wesley * Faber Drive * Fighting For Ithaca * Hanson * I65 * Jakalope * Jessica Lee * Jessie Farrell * Kadooh * The Jins * Jojo Mason * Marianas Trench * Matt Webb * Melissa Rae Barrie * My Darkest Days * Nathan Tries * Nick Carter * Oakalla * One Bad Son * Paige Morgan * Ralph * Small Town Pistols * Suzie McNeil * The Katherines * The Suits XL * Theory of a Deadman * Thornley * Tommy Lee == See also == * List of record labels ==References== http://604studiosvan.com/ ==External links== * Official site Category:Canadian independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 2002 Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:2002 establishments in British Columbia ",
