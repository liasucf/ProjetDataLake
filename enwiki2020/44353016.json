    "text": "The Louisiana lieutenant gubernatorial election took place on October 24, 2015, to elect the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, with a runoff election held on November 21, 2015. Incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne did not run for re-election to a second full term in office. He instead ran for Governor. Billy Nungesser won the election defeating Kip Holden, despite a Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election, in which John Bel Edwards defeated David Vitter by a similar margin. Under Louisiana's jungle primary system, all candidates appeared on the same ballot, regardless of party and voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. Since no candidate received a majority of the vote during the primary election, a runoff election was held on November 21, 2015 between Holden and Nungesser. Louisiana is the only state that has a jungle primary system (California and Washington have a similar \"top two primary\" system). ==Candidates== ===Republican Party=== ====Filed==== * Elbert Guillory, state senator * Billy Nungesser, President of Plaquemines Parish and candidate for lieutenant governor in 2011 * John Young, President of Jefferson Parish ====Declined==== * Scott Angelle, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner and former Lieutenant Governor (ran for Governor) * Jay Dardenne, incumbent Lieutenant Governor (ran for Governor) * Mike Edmonson, Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police ===Democratic Party=== ====Filed==== * Kip Holden, Mayor-President of East Baton Rouge Parish ====Did not run==== * Rick Gallot, state senator ==Jungle primary== ===Polling=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign= bottom ! style=\"width:140px;\"| Poll source ! style=\"width:160px;\"| Date(s) administered ! class=small | Sample size ! error ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Elbert Guillory (R) ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Kip Holden (D) ! style=\"width:110px;\"| Billy Nungesser (R) ! style=\"width:100px;\"| John Young (R) ! style=\"width:40px;\"| Undecided |- | Triumph | align=center| March 5, 2015 | align=center| 1,655 | align=center| | align=center| 2% | align=center| 33% | align=center| 23% | align=center| 20% | align=center| 22% |- | Multi-Quest | align=center| October 22\u201324, 2014 | align=center| 606 | align=center| \u00b1 4% | align=center| \u2014 | align=center| 8.1% | align=center| 10.3% | align=center| 9.6% | align=center| 72% |} ===Results=== thumb|Results by parish: ==Runoff== ===Results=== ==See also== *United States gubernatorial elections, 2015 *Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana ==References== ==External links== *Elbert Guillory for Lieutenant Governor *Kip Holden for Lieutenant Governor *Billy Nungesser for Lieutenant Governor *John Young for Lieutenant Governor Lieutenant Governor 2015 ",
