    "text": "In mathematics, a family \\mathcal{F} of sets is of finite character provided it has the following properties: #For each A\\in \\mathcal{F}, every finite subset of A belongs to \\mathcal{F}. #If every finite subset of a given set A belongs to \\mathcal{F}, then A belongs to \\mathcal{F}. ==Properties== A family \\mathcal{F} of sets of finite character enjoys the following properties: #For each A\\in \\mathcal{F}, every (finite or infinite) subset of A belongs to \\mathcal{F}. # Tukey's lemma: In \\mathcal{F}, partially ordered by inclusion, the union of every chain of elements of \\mathcal{F} also belong to \\mathcal{F}, therefore, by Zorn's lemma, \\mathcal{F} contains at least one maximal element. ==Example== Let V be a vector space, and let F be the family of linearly independent subsets of V. Then F is a family of finite character (because a subset X \u2286 V is linearly dependent iff X has a finite subset which is linearly dependent). Therefore, in every vector space, there exists a maximal family of linearly independent elements. As a maximal family is a vector basis, every vector space has a (possibly infinite) vector basis.
