Madrazo is the owner of The Valley Running Company in McAllen, Texas, where he resides. == 2018 Winter Olympics == Prior to competing in the 2018 Winter Games, Madrazo was a triathlete who competed professionally in a number of events. He became interested in cross-country skiing after reading an article about Peruvian cross-country skier Roberto Carcel\u00e9n in a sports magazine. He contacted Carcel\u00e9n to ask for his advice and later travelled to South America where he met other skiers and coaches. Along with Chilean skier Yonathan Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez and Tongan skier Pita Taufatofua, he formed an independent training group in an attempt to qualify for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The three skiers, under the initiative of Taufatofua, rented a cabin in Hittisau, Austria, and trained for 10 hours daily. He formed part of the Mexican Ski Federation component of the Mexican delegation to the 2018 Olympics, along with alpine skiers Sarah Schleper and Rodolfo Dickson, and freestyle skier Roberto Franco. At the opening ceremony in PyeongChang, Madrazo acted as the flag bearer for team Mexico. Sporting a traditional charro hat, Madrazo received praise for his high \"level of happy\" at the opening ceremony. Later, Madrazo competed in the Men's 15km Cross-country skiing event. Although Madrazo came in last of those who finished (116), he was once again praised for his undying level of enthusiasm as he celebrated his presence at the Olympics waving a Mexican flag given by a fan. Taufatofua, who finished 114 and about 3 minutes ahead, waited for him at the finish line. Winner Dario Cologna of Switzerland returned to the finish line to shake his hand. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-madrazo-winter-olympics- finish_us_5a86ac0fe4b05c2bcac996a1 ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Cross-country skiers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Mexican male cross-country skiers Category:Olympic cross- country skiers of Mexico ",
