    "text": "In statistics, Basu's theorem states that any boundedly complete minimal sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic. This is a 1955 result of Debabrata Basu.Basu (1955) It is often used in statistics as a tool to prove independence of two statistics, by first demonstrating one is complete sufficient and the other is ancillary, then appealing to the theorem. An example of this is to show that the sample mean and sample variance of a normal distribution are independent statistics, which is done in the Example section below. This property (independence of sample mean and sample variance) characterizes normal distributions. == Statement == Let (P_\\theta; \\theta \\in \\Theta) be a family of distributions on a measurable space (X, \\mathcal{A}) and T,A measurable maps from (X, \\mathcal{A}) to some measurable space (Y, \\mathcal{B}). (Such maps are called a statistic.) If T is a boundedly complete sufficient statistic for \\theta, and A is ancillary to \\theta, then T is independent of A. === Proof === Let P_\\theta^T and P_\\theta^A be the marginal distributions of T and A respectively. Denote by A^{-1}(B) the preimage of a set B under the map A. For any measurable set B \\in \\mathcal{B} we have :P_\\theta^A(B) = P_\\theta (A^{-1}(B)) = \\int_{Y} P_\\theta(A^{-1}(B) \\mid T=t) \\ P_\\theta^T (dt). The distribution P_\\theta^A does not depend on \\theta because A is ancillary. Likewise, P_\\theta(\\cdot \\mid T = t) does not depend on \\theta because T is sufficient. Therefore : \\int_Y \\big[ P(A^{-1}(B) \\mid T=t) - P^A(B) \\big] \\ P_\\theta^T (dt) = 0. Note the integrand (the function inside the integral) is a function of t and not \\theta. Therefore, since T is boundedly complete the function :g(t) = P(A^{-1}(B) \\mid T=t) - P^A(B) is zero for P_\\theta^T almost all values of t and thus :P(A^{-1}(B) \\mid T=t) = P^A(B) for almost all t. Therefore, A is independent of T. ==Example== ===Independence of sample mean and sample variance of a normal distribution (known variance)=== Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be independent, identically distributed normal random variables with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c32. Then with respect to the parameter \u03bc, one can show that :\\widehat{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sum X_i}{n}, the sample mean, is a complete sufficient statistic \u2013 it is all the information one can derive to estimate \u03bc, and no more \u2013 and :\\widehat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{\\sum \\left(X_i-\\bar{X}\\right)^2}{n-1}, the sample variance, is an ancillary statistic \u2013 its distribution does not depend on \u03bc. Therefore, from Basu's theorem it follows that these statistics are independent. This independence result can also be proven by Cochran's theorem. Further, this property (that the sample mean and sample variance of the normal distribution are independent) characterizes the normal distribution \u2013 no other distribution has this property. ==Notes== ==References== * * Mukhopadhyay, Nitis (2000).
