Its fronds are up to 2.4 mm wide and monostromatic, that is formed of a thin layer of cells,Maggs, C.A. and Hommersand, M.H. 1993. Seaweeds of the British Isles, Volume 1 Rhodopyta Part 3A Ceramiales. The Natural History Museum, London http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 14 September 2018 narrow and branching in one plane. A midrib runs along the center of the branches with fine microscopic veins from the midrib to the margins. The tips of the young branches are asymmetric, incurved and blunt, not pointed.Bunker, F.StP.D., Brodie, J.A., Maggs, C.A. and Bunker, A.R.2017 Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. Second Edition. Wild Nature Press, Plymouth.UK Two other algae are similar: Apoglossum ruscifolium has blunt tips to the branches while Hypoglossum hypoglossoides has pointed tips, further A. ruscifolium has symmetrical apices unlike the those of M. alata which develop more on one side than the other giving \"pincer-like\" tips. 1\\. A broad variety. 2. Narrow variety: \u2014 both the natural size. 3. Apex of branch with tetraspores. 4. Apex with the same, contained in proper leaflets. 5. A tetraspore. G. Apex with tubercles. 7. Section of a tubercle. 8. Portion of the lamina and midrib : \u2014 Magnified. ==Reproduction== The plants are dioecious. Spermatangial sori, the male gametes, develop in patches near the tips of the branches. The cystocarps develop and become hemispherical growing to 5 mm in diameter on the branches. Tetrasporangia form on the branches in patches up to 1 mm wide. ==Habitat== Growing on rock or large algae epiphytically and epilithically in the low littoral and upper sub-littoral. ==Distribution== In Ireland this has been recorded from County Donegal elsewhere in the North Atlantic on the European coasts it has been recorded from Greenland, Iceland to Spain. On the American from Canada to Massachusetts.Morton, O. 2003. The marine macroalgae of County Donegal, Ireland.
