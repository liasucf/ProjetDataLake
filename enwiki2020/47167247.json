    "text": "Yokoi's Cave refers to two places on the island of Guam. The original reference is to the actual hideout of Imperial Japanese Army Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi, the last Japanese soldier of World War II to surrender on the island (in 1972). Yokoi and several companions hid out in this area for more than 25 years, two of them dying in the cave; their remains were found in the cave after Yokoi's surrender. The second reference is to a recreation of his cave, located not far from where the original was located, that is a tourist attraction in Talofofo Falls Resort Park in the village of Talofofo. The original cave site, which was destroyed by a typhoon, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam ==References== Category:World War II on the National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1944 ",
