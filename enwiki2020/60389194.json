    "text": "Anne R\u00e9gina Badet (9 October 1876 \u2013 26 October 1949) was a French comedic actress, dancer, and star of the \u00d3pera-Comique de Paris. == Career == R\u00e9gina Badet in 1910. Badet was first dancer with the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux in 1890. She began with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique de Paris in 1904, dancing in productions of Lakm\u00e9 (1905), Aphrodite (1906, in which she shared billing with dancer Mata Hari), Ariane et Barbe-Bleue (1907), Carmen (1908), Bacchus triomphant (1909), Le Mariage de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque (1909), Athana\u00efs (1910), Sapph\u00f4 (1912), La Grande Famille (1914), Un Mari dans du Coton (1916), Les Trois Sultanes (1917), Appassionata (1920), and Le Venin (1923). She was known for creating the role of Conchita Perez in a stage adaptation of La Femme et le Pantin (1910), in which her very minimal costume was a matter of some scandal. Badet appeared in French silent films Le Secret de Myrto (1908), Le Retour d'Ulysse (1909), Carmen (1910), La Saltarella (1912), Zo\u00e9 a le c\u0153ur trop tendre (A Woman's Last Card, 1912), Le Spectre du pass\u00e9 (1913), Vendetta (1914), Manuella (1916), Le Lotus d'or (The Golden Lotus, 1916), Sadounah (No Greater Love 1919), and Ma\u00eetre \u00c9vora (1922). Her dances were often in the popular exotic style, referencing ancient or \"oriental\" themes.Julie McQuinn, \"Unofficial discourses of gender and sexuality at the Op\u00e9ra -Comique during the Belle Epoque\" (PhD dissertation, Northwestern University, 2003): 164-170. ProQuest document 305317501. \"Mlle. Badet does not seem to content herself with the lavish display of her charmingly pretty figure,\" commented an American writer, \"but to run the gamut from the somewhat acrobatic and to our eyes grotesque posturing and 'stunts' which found so much favor with the ancients, to dances of ideas and emotions of a much higher and more poetic order, mingled with passages of adoration of and oblation to the goddess whom she serves.\" An American publication described her as \"A Dancing Bernhardt,\" quoting her as saying \"Every woman can live artistically,\" and \"Nature never intended that a single woman should be plain or unattractive.\" Badet was considered a great beauty of the Paris stage. A rose variety was named \"Regina Badet\" in 1909. During World War I she was active in the Union des Arts, theatrical professionals in Paris raising funds for war relief. == Personal life == The Ch\u00e2teau Marbuzet in Bordeaux was reportedly built for Badet at great expense. It remains today as part of a vineyard. Pianist Arthur Rubinstein described a shipboard affair with Badet, on their way to Argentina in 1917. Badet died in 1949, aged 73 years, in Bordeaux. She was survived by her husband of three years, Fran\u00e7ois Merman. In 2016, R\u00e9gina Badet was played by actress H\u00e9l\u00e8na Soubeyrand in a French film, Chocolat, about the Paris stage of the late nineteenth century. == References == == External links == * * * Photographs of R\u00e9gina Badet at Getty Images. * * A photograph of R\u00e9gina Badet in the J.
