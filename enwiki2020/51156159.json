The order returned in 1935 to officiate at the church of the Annunziata (which also was dedicated to Santa Rita), canonized in 1900. The order also ran an adjacent orphanage until 1980s. With the support of the Archbishop Monsignor Carlo Minchiatti, they decided to form a new parish in the neighborhood of Pace Vecchia, with the aim of forming a sanctuary dedicated to Santa Rita. In 1996, they contracted with IACP, to build the present modern church, the architect was Benedetto Aloia. The church was consecrated in 2003.parish church, official site.
