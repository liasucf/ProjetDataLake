He mentions the town in the 1928 Victor recording of the song, Train 45: \"I'm a goin' to Laurel Bloomery, Tennessee, Henry...\" ===Bristol sessions=== The Bristol recording sessions, held in 1927, have been called by some the \"Big Bang\" of modern country music.Stimeling, Travis D. \"Recording Reviews: \"the Bristol Sessions, 1927-1928: The Big Bang of Country Music\".\" Journal of the Society for American Music 7.2 (2013): 219-22.

In 1998, the U.S. Congress formally recognized Bristol as the \"Birthplace of Country Music\", \"Birthplace of Country Music\", AmericasLibrary.gov, 2011, web: AL. and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum opened in 2014. ===Johnson City sessions=== Though less-known than the Bristol sessions, the Johnson City sessions, of 1928 and 1929, also played a significant role in helping to popularize country and bluegrass music. Some recordings from the Johnson City sessions influenced such later musicians as Bob Dylan and Doc Watson.\"Old-Time Music Heritage\" , Johnson's DepotWayne Erbsen, \"Walter Davis: Fist and Skull Banjo,\" Bluegrass Unlimited: March 1981, 22-26 ===Knoxville sessions=== In 1929 and 1930, a series of recording sessions was held in Knoxville.

Perhaps the most well-known is Rocky Top. Released by the Osbourne Brothers in 1967, it is one of the ten state songs of Tennessee. Though often performed at Tennessee Volunteers football games, it is not the official fight song of the University of Tennessee (Down the Field). In addition, Rocky Top, Tennessee is now a town, northwest of Knoxville, which changed its name from Lake City in 2014. Ronnie Milsap's 1980 song, Smoky Mountain Rain, is also one of Tennessee's state songs. Dolly Parton's hit, My Tennessee Mountain Home, served as the centerpiece of her 1973 album, My Tennessee Mountain Home. Parton also reminisced on her rural childhood in her 1984 song, Tennessee Homesick Blues. East Tennessee Blues, written in 1926 by Charlie Bowman, (from Gray), continues to be a popular bluegrass song. Please Come to Boston, recorded and written in 1974 by Dave Loggins, has been covered by many artists, including David Allan Coe and Joan Baez. The song concludes with the line, \"I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee.\" Loggins, born in Mountain City in 1947, is the second cousin of singer Kenny Loggins. Chattanooga Choo Choo, originally published in 1941, tells the story of a train trip to Chattanooga. In 1957, the British musician Lonnie Donegan had a No. 1 UK hit with a skiffle version of \"Cumberland Gap\". In addition, Dixieland Delight, released by Alabama in 1983, was inspired by a highway drive through Rutledge, Tennessee. ====Davy Crockett==== The Ballad of Davy Crockett helped to popularize the 1955 film Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier. First recorded and introduced on the television series Disneyland in 1954, it has been covered by a number of artists, most notably Tennessee Ernie Ford. The song's lyrics say Crockett was \"born on a mountaintop in Tennessee\", but his actual birthplace was Limestone, Tennessee, the home of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park.http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/t/theballadofdavycrockett.shtml In addition to his renowned frontier exploits and military service, Crockett served East Tennessee as a state legislator and Congressman. ====Daniel Boone==== The folk hero Daniel Boone, who helped explore East Tennessee, was honored in the soundtrack for the television series Daniel Boone, which ran from 1964 until 1970.http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/d/danielboone.shtmlhttps://vimeo.com/22152238?lite=1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hwqdQ0SkjQ The last of three versions of the theme song was sung by The Imperials, a Grammy-winning Christian music group. ====Ruby Falls==== Ruby Falls, a waterfall inside the Lookout Mountain Caverns, has inspired multiple songs. Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison wrote and recorded the song \"See Ruby Falls\", on Cash's 1970 album Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Country artist Ray Stevens also included a song named \"Ruby Falls\" on his 2011 album, Bozos's Back Again.https://open.spotify.com/album/4ftrxr5jhzitFHg9fSSOLc ====Kenny Chesney==== Country superstar Kenny Chesney, (originally from Luttrell), has described scenery from his East Tennessee youth in many of his songs, especially I Go Back.
