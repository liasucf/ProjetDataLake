    "text": "K54GK was a low-power Class A television station in Sioux City, Iowa, United States, broadcasting locally in analog on UHF channel 51 as an affiliate of the Trinity Broadcast Network. Founded October 15, 1992, the station was owned by Cornerstone Faith Center. The station's license was cancelled and its call sign deleted by the Federal Communications Commission on May 10, 2011. K54GK's programming was the same national schedule as TBN, but deviated for taped repeats of their services, Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11PM. Cable One did not offer the channel, but broadcast the taped service on their local Public-access television cable TV channel, Thursdays at 6:30PM. The church's other program, Breakaway was seen Sunday mornings on KTIV, and Sundays at 12 Noon CT on Sky Angel's Angel One channel. ==Notes== * Cornerstone Faith Center was not associated with Cornerstone Television, a religious broadcaster that competes with TBN. * Even though the station broadcast on channel 51, the calls assigned to them had \"54\" instead of \"51\". Normally, low-powered television stations with repeater-style calls feature the number that equals the channel they're broadcasting on. == External links == *TBN official site *Cornerstone Faith Center official site * Category:Religious television stations in the United States Category:Trinity Broadcasting Network affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992 Category:Defunct terrestrial television stations in the United States Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2011 Category:1992 establishments in Iowa Category:2011 disestablishments in Iowa Category:Defunct mass media in Iowa ",
