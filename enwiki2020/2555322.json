She shares with Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as, Ray Loriga and Luc\u00eda Etxebarria a crisp style visibly influenced by commercial culture \u2014 advertising, pop music, film and television. Gabriela Bustelo is one of the few Spanish women who have written science fiction. Her second novel Planeta Hembra (RBA, 2001), located in New York, is a dystopia that envisaged \u2014almost two decades ago\u2014 the underlying conflict between women and men that in the 21st century has become the MeToo Movement as a global battle of the sexes. La historia de siempre jam\u00e1s (El And\u00e9n, 2007) portrays the immorality and shallowness of European political elites. In 1996 she began to write for publications such as Vogue and Gala (magazine), having penned political columns for a decade at newspapers La Raz\u00f3n and La Gaceta. After signing from 2015 to 2017 a weekly tribune for the Spanish digital newspaper \"Vozp\u00f3puli\" (vozpopuli.com) and a weekly op-ed column in English for the digital newspaper \"The Objective\" (theobjective.com), Bustelo has been writing a weekly op-ed column for \"Cuarto Poder\" (cuartopoder.com) since September 2017.
