He travelled in 1681 to Italy and is registered there in Florence from 1689 to 1700. He died, perhaps in Italy, some time before 1702, when he was recorded as deceased by the painter Vincent van der Vinne's son in his father's list of members of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. ==References== *Salomon Rombouts on Artnet Category:1655 births Category:1702 deaths Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Artists from Haarlem Category:Members of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke ",
