In 1908 she began work at the Metropolitan Library where she became part of Ervin Szab\u00f3's inner circle.Blanka Pikler, Osck.hu, Retrieved 24 April 2017 By 1911 she was leading their catalogue department. In 1919 the University of Budapest decided to get rid of communists, but this turned into a purge of Jews, due to many communist intellectuals and revolutionaries being Jewish. Pikler was arrested and held for two weeks although as friends noted she disliked communists and communism. She was not beaten, but she was dismissed. In 1925 she co-authored a book that created an index of all the books in Hungarian. She published a range of books including her catalogues and a history of the Budapest library. She died in April 1957. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Writers from Budapest Category:Hungarian librarians Category:Hungarian feminists ",
