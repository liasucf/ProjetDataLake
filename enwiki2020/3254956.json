    "text": "Ann-Mary Gwynne Grant (n\u00e9e Fletcher; born May 6, 1955) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who captained the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Because of a boycott by western European, Australasian and other countries, the Women's Field Hockey Tournament contained fewer teams than normal. A late request was sent to the government of Zimbabwe, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games. Grant captained the team. Grant is the sister of former Zimbabwe cricketer and India cricket coach Duncan Fletcher. ==References== * * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Harare Category:Zimbabwean female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Zimbabwe Category:Field hockey players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Zimbabwe Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:White Zimbabwean sportspeople ",
