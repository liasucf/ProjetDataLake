The conservation park occupies land in sections 255 and 256 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Monbulla. It is bounded by roads on three sides - Clay Wells Road (also known as the Robe - Penola road) to the south, Searle Road to the east and Rifle Range Road to the west. A wetland called Green Swamp located in its south-west was described in 1990 as \u201ca semi-permanent wetland of approximately \u201d while in its south-east corner, there is a \u201csmall disused quarry.\u201d It originally acquired protected area status as one of two parcels of land proclaimed as a fauna sanctuary on 19 February 1970 under the Fauna Conservation Act 1964-1965 with the other parcel being located in the Hundred of Penola. On 10 September 1970, Sections 255 and 256 in the Hundred of Monbulla were proclaimed under the National Parks Act 1966 as the Penola National Park. On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Penola Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed both of the above-mentioned acts along with other statutes concerned with conservation. The land was reported in 1990 as being previously used for grazing on the basis of the condition of the vegetation and the presence of a well at the edge of the Green Swamp. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons: > A fine reserve preserving a range of habitat types representative of the > stranded dune and swale terrain of the lower south-east of South Australia. > The Park incorporates both dune and swale with associated seasonal swamp. > Macropus rufogriseus, Trichosurus vulpecula, Tachylglossus aculeatus and > Rattus leutreolus. The diverse avifauna is augmented by a winter influx of > waterbirds. In 1990, the conservation park was described as follows: > \u2026underlain by consolidated calcarenite dunes, overlain with red, weakly > structured sandy soils and unconsolidated stranded dunes of bleached sands > with a yellow-grey B horizon. Two large wetland areas have a marl base and > black organic soils. River red gum flats have sandy, mottled-yellow duplex > soil. In 1990, the following vegetation associations were present: # A \u201cwoodland or open woodland of brown stringybark\u201d occupied the dunes. #A river red gum woodland with an understorey of \u201cannual grasses and herbs and scattered shrubs\u201d was present on \u201cthe flats associated with the wetlands.\u201d #\u201cIsolated stands\u201d of swamp gum and rough barked manna gum were present on \u201cthe edges of the wetter areas.\u201d #The north-west of the conservation park which was subject to periodic inundation supported \u201ca large area of low heath.\u201d #\u201dWater-ribbons and yellow marsh flower\u201d were present in the wetlands. As of 1990, visitation consisted of use \u201cmainly by local residents and schools groups\u201d and \u201coccasional\u201d use for \u201cbush camping.\u201d The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== * ==External links== *Penola Conservation Park official website *Penola Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website *Penola Conservation Park webpage on the Birds SA website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ",
