In 2003 he criticised Jonas Gardell's and Mark Levengood's hosting of the 2003 Melodifestivalen, accusing Sveriges Television of giving in to what he perceived as the \"gay lobby\" and saying that the couple had made the festival into a manifestation of their sexual orientation that spits in the audience's faces in disrespect.
