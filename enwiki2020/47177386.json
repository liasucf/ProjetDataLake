    "text": "Song of the Miraculous Hind () is a 2002 Hungarian animated mythological and historical film directed by Marcell Jankovics. It tells the story of the Hungarian people, from the creation of the first humans to the time of Prince G\u00e9za, when the nation was Christianized. The narrative is told in five sections, each focusing on a different era. The film was produced by Pannonia Film Studio. It was released on Hungarian cinemas on 21 February 2002. ==Reception== David Stratton wrote in Variety: \"An animated history lesson for Hungarian schoolkids, Song of the Miraculous Hind has little or nothing to offer non-Magyars. Long-in-production feature from veteran Marcell Jankovics offers good, if very retro, design, and bright use of color, but little in the way of contemporary animation techniques. ... Using a mainly choral soundtrack, pic takes itself very seriously, with no attempts at humor as the lengthy saga unfolds.\" ==References== Category:2000s historical films Category:2002 animated films Category:2002 films Category:Films based on European myths and legends Category:Films directed by Marcell Jankovics Category:Hungarian animated films Category:Hungarian films Category:Hungarian historical films Category:Hungarian mythology Category:Hungarian-language films Category:Religious epic films ",
