Museum of California The channel is part of Point Isabel Regional Shoreline, the \"largest dog park in the United States\", and serves as a swimming area for the animals. Hoffman Channel is adjacent to Point Isabel promontory, and was formerly a sandy beach on its south shore. ==Development proposal== There was a controversial proposal to add a 98,000 sq. ft. (9,100 m2) Kohl's department store on a site between the Costco store and the marsh.New Kohl's store proposed for Richmond, by Katherine Tam, Contra Costa Times, May 30, 2008, access date August 8, 2008 Many residents were worried about potential negative effects on increased nighttime lighting that will make endangered birds such as the California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse more susceptible to predators. This is in addition to other birds that make overnight stopovers at the marsh that would also possibly decrease in number and therefore reduce biodiversity. The Richmond Annex Neighborhood Council officially opposed the project. ==Park== Hoffman Marsh was saved from development, to be protected within Eastshore State Park. Habitat restoration plans are being developed.San Francisco Bay Area Conservation Commons: Hoffman Marsh Restoration Project, Eastshore State Park . accessed 1.13.2013 ==See also== *Parks in Richmond, California *Point Isabel (promontory) ==References== ==External links== *Panoramic photo of Hoffman Marsh Category:Geography of Richmond, California Category:Parks in Richmond, California Category:Wetlands of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Marshes of California Category:Landforms of Contra Costa County, California ",
