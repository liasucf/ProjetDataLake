Reviewing it for Screendaily, Wendy Ide noted the film as being structurally a little over-complicated, but still is an impressive drama which feels convincingly rooted in real lives and stories. Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter writes, \"Beautiful Days certainly lives up to its title with its mesmerizing imagery and very polished production values. But it is weighed down by a clich\u00e9d narrative and simplistic moral binaries\". ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 drama films Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean drama films Category:2018 directorial debut films ",
