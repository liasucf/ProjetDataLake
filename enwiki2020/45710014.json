    "text": "Justin Moss (born June 19, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays in the French Nationale Masculine 1 league. He played college basketball with the Buffalo Bulls. == Collegiate career == Moss committed to Toledo out of high school but was sidelined before his freshman year after being diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart condition thought to be career-ending. Despite having an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator implanted into his chest, Toledo refused to clear Moss to play but offered to allow him to remain at the school on an athletic scholarship. As a result, Moss transferred to Indian Hills Community College in Iowa where he played one season before joining his former high school coach Nate Oats at Buffalo for his sophomore season. As a junior in 2015, he was named Mid- American Conference Player of the Year and an Associated Press Honorable Mention All-American. Moss received the MAC East Player of the Week award twice that season, once for a week which included a double-double against the top-ranked Kentucky Wildcats. At the conclusion of the spring semester, UB Athletics recognized Moss as the most valuable men's basketball player of the season during the Blue and White Awards Show on ESPN3. In June 2015, shortly after earning Conference Player of the Year honors, Moss and two of his teammates were discovered to have stolen $650 from Buffalo football players. On August 24, 2015, he was dismissed from the University at Buffalo. == Professional career == Moss signed with the Orangeville A's after leaving school. Moss was named the league's Player of the Week for the week ending April 3, 2016. He finished the season ranked third in the league in rebounds and fourth in points.http://www.dakstats.com/Websync/Pages/Team/TeamPage.aspx?association=60&sg;=MBB&sea;=NBLMBB_2015&team;=19079 In June 2016, he was invited along with six other players to try out for the Philadelphia 76ers prior to the 2016 NBA Draft.
