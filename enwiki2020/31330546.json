    "text": "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 2011 Cold War spy thriller film directed by Tomas Alfredson. The screenplay was written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1974 novel of the same name. The film, starring Gary Oldman as George Smiley, along with Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, David Dencik and Kathy Burke. It is set in London in the early 1970s and follows the hunt for a Soviet double agent at the top of the British secret service. The film was produced through the British company Working Title Films and financed by France's StudioCanal. It premiered in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing film at the British box office for three consecutive weeks. It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film. The film also received three Oscar nominations: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and for Oldman, Best Actor. The novel had previously been adapted into the award- winning 1979 BBC miniseries of the same name with Alec Guinness playing the lead role of Smiley. ==Plot== In 1973, \"Control\", head of British intelligence (\"The Circus\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a prospective defector, a Hungarian Army general who has the name of a mole at the top of British Intelligence. Prideaux, realising the meeting is a trap, is shot as he tries to leave. Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced to retire following the botched assignment, and Control dies soon after. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, Bill Haydon his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase his lieutenants. Alleline and Bland request budget approval from civil servant Oliver Lacon for Operation \"Witchcraft\", including a safe house for their high-level Soviet source. Lacon explains that the CIA see the British service as \"still a leaky ship.\" Former field agent Ricki Tarr contacts Lacon to warn that there has been a mole right at the top of the Circus for years. Concerned that this is similar to Control's suspicions, Lacon asks Smiley to investigate. Smiley enlists the help of Tarr's boss Peter Guillam who is still with the Service, and retired Special Branch officer George Mendel. In Control's flat Smiley and Guillam find materials related to the mole investigation. In flashback, Smiley recalls an angry meeting of Circus leadership in which Alleline disclosed apparently high-value Soviet intelligence but refused to reveal the source. A furious Control explained it was from the Witchcraft operation for which Alleline got approval by going over Control's head. Smiley has Guillam find the personnel changes Alleline made after Control and Smiley were forced out. Smiley interviews analyst Connie Sachs who was sacked by Alleline. Sachs had deduced that Soviet cultural attach\u00e9 Alexei Polyakov was really a military officer and suspected he was setting up moles in foreign agencies. Esterhase and Alleline dismissed her suspicions. She shows Smiley a photograph of Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon, calling them \"the inseparables.\" Smiley discovers a payment from the Service to \"Mr Ellis\", a cover name for the supposedly-deceased Prideaux, now teaching at a boarding school and living in a caravan. Smiley finds Ricki Tarr in his house. In flashback, Tarr describes an assignment in Istanbul where Soviet agent Irina wanted to exchange the identity of the mole in return for asylum. Tarr's cable to the Circus of Irina's offer was not acted on. Soon after, the local station chief was murdered and Irina abducted. Realising the mole had intercepted the cable and fearing for his own life, Tarr went into hiding. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr cabled. Guillam obtains the book, but while in the building is brought before Circus leadership to be told by Alleline that Tarr is a traitor, has recently been detected in Paris, and has been paid 30,000 pounds by someone. Guillam returns to Smiley, sees Tarr and beats him bloody, telling Smiley what he has been told by Alleline. Smiley finds that the logbook pages for the night of Tarr's cable have been removed, supporting his story. Guillam realises that Smiley didn't tell him he had Tarr in case he didn't make it back out of the Circus. Smiley tells Guillam of how, in 1955, he had met Moscow Centre's spymaster Karla, then out of favour with his own side, and urged him to defect, repeatedly begging him to \"think of his wife\". Karla had kept Smiley's lighter, engraved as a gift from his wife Ann, and returned to the USSR expecting to be executed. Too late, Smiley realised that he had revealed his own weak spot: his love for his unfaithful wife. Smiley interviews the duty officer from the night that Prideaux was shot. As the news sent Control into a catatonic state the duty officer called Smiley's home and left a message with Smiley's wife. Bill Haydon arrived soon after and cleaned out everything related to Prideaux's assignment. Smiley guesses that Haydon was at Smiley's house with Ann, with whom he was having an affair. Smiley visits Prideaux who says his Budapest mission was to relay the identity of the mole to Control via a code name: Tinker for Alleline, Tailor for Haydon, Soldier for Bland, Poorman for Esterhase, and Beggarman for Smiley. He was tortured by the KGB, with Karla shooting Irina in front of him and flaunting Smiley's lighter. He was eventually returned by the Soviets, but told by Esterhase that his career in intelligence was over. Smiley deduces that Polyakov is the \"Witchcraft\" source. Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been giving him low-grade British intelligence in return for supposedly high-grade Soviet intelligence, which the British then trade with the CIA for high-grade American intelligence. The Soviet intelligence is just enough to keep the CIA interested \u2014 but the mole (one of the four) has actually been passing high- grade British and US material to his handler Polyakov. Smiley drives to an airfield with the Hungarian-born Esterhase and tells him what he has learned about Witchcraft, threatening to have him deported until he gives up the safe house address. Smiley instructs Tarr to go to the Paris station and cable London, claiming to have vital information. As planned, the mole intercepts the cable and, instead of taking action, stalls for time to go to the safe house and alert Polyakov. Smiley is sitting in wait and arrests the mole\u2014revealed to be Bill Haydon\u2014at gunpoint. Haydon explains that Prideaux told him about the operation in Hungary, and that he persuaded the Soviets to return Prideaux rather than kill him. He says that Karla respected Smiley's abilities, and his affair with Ann Smiley was Karla's idea to cloud his judgement. Before Haydon can be traded to the Soviets, Prideaux kills him. Smiley finds Ann has returned home, and he becomes the new head of the Circus. ==Cast== * Gary Oldman as George Smiley (\"Beggarman\") * Colin Firth as Bill Haydon (\"Tailor\") * Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr * Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux * Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\") * Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam * David Dencik as Toby Esterhase (\"Poorman\") * Stephen Graham as Jerry Westerby * Simon McBurney as Oliver Lacon * Toby Jones as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\") * John Hurt as Control * Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs * Roger Lloyd- Pack as Mendel * Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina * Arthur Nightingale as Bryant * John le Carr\u00e9 as Christmas party guest * Christian McKay as Mackelvore * Konstantin Khabensky as Polyakov * Linda Marlowe as Mrs McCraig * Michael Sarne as Karla * Tomasz Kowalski as Boris * Stuart Graham as Minister * Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi as Hungarian agent * Laura Carmichael as Sal ==Production== ===Development=== The project was initiated by Peter Morgan when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce. Morgan dropped out as the writer for personal reasons but still served as an executive producer. Following Morgan's departure as writer, Working Title hired Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor to redraft the script. Park Chan- wook considered directing the film, but ultimately turned it down. Tomas Alfredson was confirmed to direct on 9 July 2009. The production is his first English language film. The film was backed financially by France's StudioCanal and had a budget corresponding to $21 million. The film is dedicated to O'Connor, who died of cancer during production. Blythe House, the exterior of \"The Circus\" ===Casting=== The director cast Gary Oldman in the role of George Smiley, and described the actor as having \"a great face\" and \"the quiet intensity and intelligence that's needed\". Many actors were connected to the other roles at various points, but only days before filming started, Oldman was still the only lead actor who officially had been contracted. David Thewlis was in talks for a role early on. Michael Fassbender was in talks at one point to star as Ricki Tarr, but the shooting schedule conflicted with his work on X-Men: First Class; Tom Hardy was cast instead. On 17 September 2010, Mark Strong was confirmed to have joined the cast. Jared Harris was cast but had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows; he was replaced by Toby Jones. John le Carr\u00e9 appears in a cameo as a guest in a party scene. The P\u00e1rizsi Udvar (\"Paris Court\") in Budapest, setting for the Hungarian caf\u00e9 scene ===Filming=== Principal photography took place between 7 October and 22 December 2010. Studio scenes were shot at a former army barracks in Mill Hill, North London. Blythe House in Kensington Olympia, West London, was used as the exterior for \"The Circus.\" The interior hall of Budapest's P\u00e1rizsi Udvar (\"Paris Court\") served as the location for the caf\u00e9 scene in which Jim Prideaux is shot. Empress Coach Works in Haggerston was used as the location for the Merlin safe house. Other scenes were filmed on Hampstead Heath and in Hampstead Ponds, where Smiley is shown swimming, and in the physics department of Imperial College London. The events which take place in Czechoslovakia in the novel were moved to Hungary, because of the country's 20% rebate for film productions. The teams filmed in Budapest for five days. Right before Christmas, the team also filmed in Istanbul for nine days. The production reunited Alfredson with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and editor Dino Jons\u00e4ter, with whom he had made his previous film Let the Right One In. ===Post-production and music=== The film took six months to edit. The final song in the film, Julio Iglesias' rendition of the French song \"La Mer\", set against a visual montage of various characters and subplots being resolved as Smiley strides into Circus headquarters to assume command, was chosen because it was something the team thought George Smiley would listen to when he was alone; Alfredson described the song as \"everything that the world of MI6 isn't\". A scene where Smiley listens to the song was filmed, but eventually cut to avoid giving it too much significance. Heard at a Circus office party, sung along to by the guests, is \"The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World\", composed by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, and performed by Sammy Davis, Jr., from the British spy spoof Licensed to Kill (1965). At the same office Christmas function, the Circus staff sing the official \"State Anthem of the USSR\", conducted by a figure dressed as Father Christmas but wearing a Lenin mask.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Soundtrack: what- song.com 6 January 2012 ==Release== Gary Oldman at the Venice International Film Festival for the premiere The film premiered in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2011. StudioCanal UK distributed the film in the United Kingdom, where it was released on 16 September 2011. The US rights were acquired by Universal Pictures, which owns Working Title, and they passed the rights to their subsidiary Focus Features. Focus planned to give the film a wide release in the United States on 9 December 2011 but pushed it to January 2012, when it was given an 800 screen release. ===Critical response=== Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 83% based on 228 reviews, with an average rating of 7.79/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a dense puzzle of anxiety, paranoia, and espionage that director Tomas Alfredson pieces together with utmost skill.\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0\u2013100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 85 based on 42 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, \"The script is a brilliant feat of condensation and restructuring: writers Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor realise the novel is overtly about information and its flow, and reshape its daunting complexity to highlight that\". David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph declared the film \"a triumph\" and gave it a five star rating, as did his colleague, Sukhdev Sandhu. Stateside, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"As Alfredson directs the expert script by Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor, the film emerges as a tale of loneliness and desperation among men who can never disclose their secret hearts, even to themselves. It's easily one of the year's best films.\" M. Enois Duarte of High-Def Digest also praised the film as a \"brilliant display of drama, mystery and suspense, one which regards its audience with intelligence\". The Telegraphs Guy Stagg, meanwhile, thought that the movie needed a car chase in the middle. Writing in The Atlantic, le Carr\u00e9 admirer James Parker favourably contrasted Smiley with the James Bond franchise but found this Tinker Tailor adaptation \"problematic\" compared to the 1979 BBC mini-series. He wrote: \"To strip down or minimalize le Carr\u00e9, however, is to sacrifice the almost Tolkienesque grain and depth of his created world: the decades-long backstory, the lingo, the arcana, the liturgical repetitions of names and functions\". Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy the fourth-best film of 2011, calling it \"a visually stunning adaptation with a stellar cast.\" In 2020, Uhlich named it the ninth-best film of the 2010s. ===Box office=== The film topped the British box office chart for three consecutive weeks and earned $80,630,608 worldwide. ===Awards and honours=== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! colspan=\"5\" |List of awards and nominations |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" !
