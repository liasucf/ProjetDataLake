    "text": "Australians Against Further Immigration (AAFI) was an Australian far-right political party which described itself as \"eco-nationalist\", was opposed to mass immigration and aimed for zero net migration. The party was founded in 1989 and registered in 1990. It ceased to exist in 2008. AAFI stood candidates at both state and federal level, but never won a seat. The party said it was a mainstream organisation, and sought to distance itself from extremist organisations such as the Australian League of Rights and from the Citizens Electoral Council.Lyle Allan (1994), 'Immigration and the Werriwa By- Election,' in People and Place, Vol.2, No.1, p.55 In 1994, Franca Arena, then a Labor member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, denounced the party in the New South Wales parliament. The party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission in December 2005, as lacking the minimum 500 members required to be registered as a political party. It contested the 2007 New South Wales state election, but was also deregistered at the state level not long after.fightdemback.org The organisation dissolved in 2008. == Federal parliament == {| class=wikitable |- | colspan=5|House of Representatives |- !
