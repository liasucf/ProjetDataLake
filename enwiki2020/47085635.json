It is also known as Vend\u00f4me Redoubt () or Madliena Redoubt (). ==History== Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq Redoubt was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of the first building programme of redoubts in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the redoubt were Qalet Marku Battery to the northwest (now demolished) and Madliena Tower to the east. The redoubt was originally linked to the latter tower by an entrenchment, but very little remains of this have survived. The redoubt consists of a pentagonal platform with short flanks and a low parapet, with a rectangular blockhouse located at the centre of its gorge. The blockhouse is divided into two rooms, with the larger room containing the main entrance. In World War II, a defensive position was built on the salient of the redoubt. ==Present day== Today, the redoubt is still in relatively good condition. It is leased to a private tenant and is used as a bar and restaurant named Las Palmas.Debono, James (18 June 2014). MEPA clamps down on restaurant in 18th century fort. Malta Today.
