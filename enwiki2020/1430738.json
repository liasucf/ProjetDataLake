    "text": "Denner is a discount supermarket chain in Switzerland. It is Switzerland's third largest supermarket chain after Migros and Coop with 11.4% market share. It is owned by the Federation of Migros Cooperatives since 2007. As of 2014, Denner has 797 stores (491 own stores and 306 running as franchise) and a revenue of 3.2 billion CHF. Denner is the second largest wine-seller in Switzerland. == History == It was started in 1860 and later developed by Karl Schweri. It later made Switzerland's first discounter in 1967 in Zurich. In 1973, it broke the country's tobacco cartel. In 2004, the sales of its 580 outlets exceeded CHF 1.8 billion. In January 2007, it was announced that Migros has purchased a majority stake in Denner. After the entrance of the worldwide-known retailers Aldi and Lidl (2004 and 2009), Denner successfully defended its leading role in the discount category. \"One for all\" (\"Einer f\u00fcr Alle\") is the company claim as it describes itself as the \"Retail's Robin Hood\", who is fighting for cheaper prices for the customers. ==References== ==External links== * Denner Market - All Things Denner * Category:Supermarkets of Switzerland Category:No frills ",
