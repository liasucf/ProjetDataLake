    "text": "\"The Heat Is On\" is a song written by Florrie Palmer and Tony Ashton, and recorded by Swedish singer Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog in 1983 as part of her first English-language solo-album, Wrap Your Arms Around Me. The song had previously been recorded in 1979 by Noosha Fox, which failed to chart when Fox released it as a single. It had also been rewritten by Manfred Mann's Earth Band as \"On the Run\" for their 1980 album Chance. F\u00e4ltskog's version reached No.1 in Sweden and Norway, and peaked at No.2 in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the UK, \"The Heat Is On\" peaked at No.35, making it Faltskog's highest charting solo single in Britain until the release of her 2004 comeback single, \"If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind\", which reached No.11. The B-side of \"The Heat Is On\" was the song \"Man\", written by F\u00e4ltskog herself. Compared to her pre-ABBA-albums where most of the songs were self-penned, this was the only song on the Wrap Your Arms Around Me album that she wrote herself. In some countries, the record companies also released a 12\"-single featuring an extended version of \"The Heat Is On\" instead of the album version. == Video == The official promo video was shot by Swedish director Erik Irion Nanne in a public bath in Stockholm (Centralbadet) for two nights after closing time. According to Nanne, after the last shot Agnetha fell into the water and could not continue (her hair got all wet). The video also features dancer Blossom Tainton. == Charts == {| class = \"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1983) !
