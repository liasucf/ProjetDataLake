Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 22-24; Varley, Paul. (1980). Jinn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014dki, pp. 110-111. She was a descendant of Emperor K\u014dgen. No firm dates can be assigned to Emperor Nintoku's life or reign, nor to that of his first wife. Nintoku is considered to have ruled the country during the late-fourth century and early-fifth century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Princess Iwa's poetry, or poems attributed to her, are included in the Kojiki, the Nihon Shoki and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b. Her tomb is said to be located in Nara Prefecture. ==Literature== Poems which Iwa-no hime is said to have exchanged with her husband are related in the Kojiki and in the Nihon Shoki.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and K\u00e4the Roth. (2005). \"Iwa no Hime\", Japan encyclopedia, p. 409. Nintoku is reported to have suffered the resentment of the Iwa-no hime during a period in which he stopped the collection of taxes, which meant that even ordinary repairs to the palace were also deferred.Brownlee, John S. and Tar\u014d Sakamoto. (1991). The Six National Histories of Japan, p. 64. Poetry attributed to Iwa is collected in the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry believed to have been collected by \u014ctomo no Yakamochi (\u5927\u4f34 \u5bb6\u6301). In her four songs she expressed love and longing for her husband.Man'y\u014dsh\u016b Best 100 , poems 85\u201388 Some modern scholars, however, advise a healthy skepticism in these difficult to verify attributions.Hall, John Whitney et al. (1993). The Cambridge History of Japan: Ancient Japan, p. 474. ==Burial mound tomb== The Imperial tomb of Iwa-no hime no Mikoto is said to be located in Saki-ch\u014d in the city of Nara.Iwa-no hime no Mikoto's misasagi -- map (upper right) Both kofun-type Imperial tombs are characterized by a keyhole-shaped island located within a wide, water-filled moat.see kofun context of kofun-like elements ==Issue== *Prince Ooe no Izahowake (\u5927\u5144\u53bb\u6765\u7a42\u5225\u5c0a) Emperor Rich\u016b *Prince Suminoe no Nakatsu (\u4f4f\u5409\u4ef2\u7687\u5b50) *Prince Mizuhawake (\u745e\u6b6f\u5225\u5c0a) Emperor Hanzei *Prince Oasatsuma wakugo no Sukune (\u96c4\u671d\u6d25\u9593\u7a1a\u5b50\u5bbf\u79b0\u5c0a) Emperor Ingy\u014d ==Notes== ==References== * Brownlee, John S. and Tar\u014d Sakamoto.
