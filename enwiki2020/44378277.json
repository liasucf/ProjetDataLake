    "text": "The Santa Catalina de Alejandria parish church, also known as the Porac church, is a 19th-century Baroque church located at Barangay Poblacion, Porac, Pampanga, Philippines. The parish church is currently under the ecclesiastical province of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. The church's octagonal bell tower collapsed during the 6.1 magnitude earthquake on April 22, 2019. ==History== As early as 1594, Porac have had an established convent with the right to vote in the provincial meetings. Despite this, services done by the convent of Porac had been either suspended or annexed to other convents like Lubao and Bacolor due to various reasons like poverty or attacks from the Zambals, an indigenous group living in the areas near the Zambales mountain ranges. This leads to a conclusion that the parochial structures utilized by the early convent of Porac may have only been built of light materials. Documents, however, give hints of possible construction periods in Porac. In 1710 and 1722, the convent was relieved from paying its rent to the San Agustin Monastery in Manila. In September 31, 1734, the convent received permission from the Provincial Fathers to use the funds of the convent to build a church. The first masonry church of Porac may have been finished around this time with Fathers Manuel Obregon and Nicolas Mornier responsible for its construction. The 18th-century church may have sustained severe damages from the 1863 earthquake because according to records, Father Isidro Bernardo laid the foundations of a new stone church sometime in 1872 and was characterized as having three naves and one transept. The said structure was renovated a couple of times since its erection: by Father Esteban Ibeas, parish priest of Santa Rita, in 1877; and in 1880 by Father Galo de la Galle. In recent years, much renovations have been executed on the church, especially notable of these are the new naves and transept, which no longer bears any trace of the original stone used in the 19th century. The church and convent were heavily damaged during World War II. Father Daniel Castrillo, the last Augustinian priest of the parish, had the church reinforced with concrete, made other restorations and rebuilt the convent. In the 1980s, the nave and transept of the church were torn down to make the more spacious church seen today. ==Architecture== The church measures 52 meters long, 12 meters wide and 9 meters high. The fa\u00e7ade is simple, adorned only by Corinthian columns of its first and second levels, iron grills on the windows, the Augustinian emblem on the triangular pediment and rectangular pilasters. The main focal point of the fa\u00e7ade is the rose window bearing an image of Saint Catherine of Alexandria rendered on stained glass. Attached to the left of the church is a slender, 4-storey, octagonal bell tower. ==Image Gallery== File:JC Porac 6.jpg|Bell tower File:JC Porac 12.jpg|Choir loft File:JC Porac 8.jpg|Image of Saint Catherine of Alexandria File:JC Porac 10.jpg|Stations of the Cross relief File:JC Porac 7.jpg|Stained glass art File:JC Porac 4.jpg|Columns with Corinthian capitals File:JC Porac 5.jpg|Rectangular window File:JC Porac 2.jpg|Eroded emblem atop the main portal File:JC Porac 3.jpg|Augustinian emblem at the pediment File:JC Porac 9.jpg|Main altarpiece File:JC Porac 11.jpg|Panoramic view of church interior File:JC Porac 1.jpg|Main door ==See also== * Pio Chapel ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Pampanga Category:Baroque architecture in the Philippines Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines ",
