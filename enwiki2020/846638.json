Two national parks, Tsavo East and Tsavo West are located in the area. The meaning of the word Tsavo is still unclear, but because of tribal conflicts, the Kamba people used to refer to the region as the place of \"slaughter\". Until the British put an end to the slave trade in the late 19th century, Tsavo was continually crossed by caravans of Arab slave traders and their captives. ==Nature== Typical flora of the region includes: *Acacia *Myrrh *Baobab Typical fauna of the region includes: *African bush elephant *Masai giraffe *Cape buffalo *Gazelle *Klipspringer *Kudu *African leopard *Lion *Cheetah *Tsetse fly Native human inhabitants: *The Waata, a bow-hunting people ==In popular culture== The place achieved fame in The Man- eaters of Tsavo by John Henry Patterson (author), a 1907 book about the eponymous pair of lions who attacked workers building the railroad bridge.
