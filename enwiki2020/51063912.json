Local business man William T. Wells purchased the Strobah property and built the Green Gables in 1886 with his wife Nora Stanford Wells as a winter home.Datzman, Ken. \"Local organization works to purchase and preserve Green Gables, a home on the National Register of Historic Places; 1920s-themed fund-raiser set Nov. 5\", Brevard Business News, vol. 34, no. 42 (Melbourne, Florida, 17 October 2016), pp. 11 and 17. Green Gables is an example of Queen Anne style architecture, and it is believed to be the first home in the area with indoor plumbing and an indoor bathroom. On May 18, 2016, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.Neale, Rick. \"Gables Wins Designation\", Florida Today, vol. 51, no. 114 (08 July 2016), pp. 1A and 2A. Green Gables was scheduled for demolition in 2015, but a group of local historians and community volunteers are working with the owners, fourth generation family members, to save the house due to its historical significance to the area. The community needed $500,000 to salvage the house as of April 2020. ==William Twining Wells== Wells was from New Jersey and New York, and owned the Wells Rustless Iron Company.
