The baths are deep salt water baths that may be used by anyone that wishes to swim in the Port Hacking River protected by a net. There is a 20-metre hole just outside the baths where many fish swimming down river seem to gather and feed. The channel provides opportunities for catching fish on the changing tide. At low tide the channel can be swum and the sand bank can be walked on, almost the other side. Locals take their dogs across for play but are always careful about the rising tide which can pose problems if not watched.
