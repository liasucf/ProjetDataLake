    "text": "Zeta Ursae Minoris (\u03b6 UMi, \u03b6 Ursae Minoris) is a star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is a white stellar class A-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of +4.28. It is approximately 380 light years from Earth. Despite its classification as a main sequence dwarf star, Zeta UMi is 3.4 times the mass of the sun and its luminosity is about 200 solar luminosities. At a surface temperature of 8,700 kelvins, this star is actually on the verge of becoming a giant star. Zeta UMi may also be a variable of the Delta Scuti type. In some Arabic star charts it is listed as \u0623\u062e\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u02bcakhf\u0101 al- farqadayn, meaning \"the dimmer of the two calves\", and paired with \u03b7 Ursae Minoris as \u02bcanwar al-farqadayn, \"the brighter of the two calves\". The names may originally refer to a pair of Ibexes, and are more properly applied to \u03b3 UMi and \u03b2 UMi respectively, the brighter two stars in the rectangle of Ursa Minor. ==References== Ursae Minoris, Zeta Category:Ursa Minor (constellation) Category:A-type main-sequence stars Ursae Minoris, 16 077055 5903 142105 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
