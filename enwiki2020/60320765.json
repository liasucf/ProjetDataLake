    "text": "The gens Abudia is known from a single individual, Abudius Ruso, one of the delatores (accusers) against Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus. Abudius was a former aedile who commanded a legion under Gaetulicus, in Upper Germany. He was condemned himself and expelled from Rome following the failure of the accusation. He seems to have accused Gaetulicus because of some form of blackmail. It is possible Ruso had attempted to denounce Gaetulicus for betrothing his daughter to Sejanus's son. ==See also== *List of Roman gentes ==References== Category:Roman gentes ",
