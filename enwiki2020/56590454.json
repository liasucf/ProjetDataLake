He was one of the pioneers of interval training and coached several world-record holders such as Rudolf Harbig, Gordon Pirie and Roger Moens. == Life == Gerschler was born in Mei\u00dfen on 14 June 1904. He obtained his Abitur in Mei\u00dfen, and then studied German, History and Sport at Leipzig University under Hermann Altrock among others. After he finished his studies, he spent some years teaching at a Gymnasium before becoming a professional coach. In Dresden, he discovered the then unknown Rudolf Harbig and became his coach.Woldemar Gerschler: Harbigs Aufstieg zum Weltrekord. (Harbig's rise to the world record) P\u00fcschel, Dresden 1939. Gerschler coached Harbig to several world records (e.g. in 800 metres in 1939), consequently he was appointed the German national coach. He also coached K\u00e4the Krau\u00df, who competed in the 1936 Olympic games. In spite of being the German national coach, Gerschler coached world-record holding runners of other nations such as the Englishman Gordon Pirie (3000 metres and 5000 metres) and the Belgian Roger Moens (800 metres). In this period he wrote his books on long jump and triple jump. After the Second World War, Gerschler also worked as a football manager for FC St. Pauli in 1947/48, and Eintracht Braunschweig in 1948/49. In Braunschweig, Gerschler also coached the athletes of the clubEintracht-Staffel verschl\u00e4ft bei Titelk\u00e4mpfen fast ihren Start: Ehemaliger Braunschweiger Leichtathlet Willi Leberk\u00fchne erinnert sich an 1948.

While working in Freiburg, Gerschler experimented with a system of short distance training runs, demanding of the athletes that they should run \"so fast that the pace required in competition would seem moderate and achievable\".Zur Geschichte des Lauftrainings (On the history of running training) (PDF, 287 kB) Interval training as practised in Freiburg was essentially physiologically oriented, being based on heart rates. Gerschler also attached considerable importance to training during the winter, which had been previously neglected, saying that \"long-distance runners should not deviate too far from the type of training they practised in summer\". == Publications == * Weit- und Dreisprung.
