    "text": "Adad-Nirari or Addu-Nirari was a king of Nuha\u0161\u0161e in the 14th century BC. His identity and succession order is debated as well as the extent of his kingdom which might have included Qatna. Adad-Nirari engaged in a military struggle again the Hittite king \u0160uppiluliuma I, asking Egypt for help and invading the kingdom of Ugarit, a Hittite vassal. Those actions prompted \u0160uppiluliuma to invade the region and relive Ugarit. Adad-Nirari's fate is unknown as he disappeared from records. ==Reign and wars== Adad-Nirari is known through two documents; the letter codenamed (EA 51) sent by the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite king to the pharaoh of Egypt, and the so-called \"Niqmaddu Treaty\" between \u0160uppiluliuma I and the Ugaritic king Niqmaddu II. Following his second Syrian foray, \u0160uppiluliuma sent an offer of alliance to the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite king; Adad-Nirari rejected, and despite being a vassal of Mitanni, he sent the letter codenamed (EA 51) to ask Egypt for help and troops. Adad-Nirari might have asked Mitanni for help but the latter was unable to send it and it seems that Egypt did not respond as well. Nuha\u0161\u0161e revolted against the Hittites, but Ugarit, which was sent an alliance offer by \u0160uppiluliuma, eventually accepted the vassalage; Adad-Nirari allied himself with Niya and Muki\u0161 then attacked Ugarit. According to Niqmaddu II, the troops of Adad-Nirari and his allies seized the cities of Ugarit, took booty and devastated the land. Thomas Richter believes that the coalition's attack triggered \u0160uppiluliuma's first Syrian war. The Hittite king, after receiving an appeal from his Ugaritic vassal, sent an army which defeated the coalition; the fate of Adad-Nirari is unknown as the Hittites make no mention of what happened to him. ==Chronological order and identity== ===As king of Nuha\u0161\u0161e=== There is a great deal of confusion over the identity of Adad-Nirari as king of Nuha\u0161\u0161e and his position in the succession of the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite monarchs. The Hittite documents mention two kings of Nuha\u0161\u0161e in the first Syrian war; in the Niqmaddu treaty, \"Adad-Nirari\" is mentioned. In the Hittite-Mitannian treaty (the Shattiwaza treaty, concluded during the second Syrian war), and the treaty between \u0160uppiluliuma and the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite king Tette, \"\u0160arrup\u0161i\" is mentioned. Most scholars agree that the events mentioned in the Niqqmadu and Shattiwaza treaties depict the events of the first Syrian war. Judging by letter (EA 51), Adad-Nirari was the king during the first Syrian war. However, the treaty with Tette makes it clear that \u0160arrup\u0161i was the king when \u0160uppiluliuma attacked I\u0161uwa, an event which started the first Syrian war as the Shattiwaza treaty shows. Many scholars dealt with the problem and offered different and contradictory opinions: *Adad-Nirari preceded \u0160arrup\u0161i: according to Richter, in the beginning of the first Syrian war, the king of Nuha\u0161\u0161e was Adad-nirari and \u0160arrup\u0161i was a Hittite prot\u00e9g\u00e9 put on the throne by \u0160uppiluliuma. Richter does not explain the Shattiwaza treaty's silence over the fate of Adad-Nirari. Amnon Altman suggested that \u0160arrup\u0161i was a claimant to the throne and the reason for not mentioning the fate of Adad-Nirari in the treaty of Shattiwaza is, according to Altman: \"Adad-Nirari was not mentioned, because he managed to escape from the Hittites, and \u0160uppiluliuma for some reason took it as a disgrace and sign of not full submission of Nuha\u0161\u0161e and thus decided not to mention Adad-Nirari in the \u0160attiwaza treaty at all.\" Altman himself admits that his answer is inadequate. *\u0160arrup\u0161i preceded Adad- Nirari: Trevor R. Bryce considered \u0160arrup\u0161i to have accepted the Hittite vassalage causing Tushratta of Mitanni to kill him; he was succeeded by Adad- Nirari who also belonged to the royal family and was willing to be a vassal of Mitanni. Jacques Freu suggested that the date of the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite attack on Ugarit followed the end of the first Syrian war, and took place at the beginning of the six-year war (second Syrian war). Freu's hypothesis have \u0160arrup\u0161i ruling during the first Syrian war, a predecessor of Adad-Nirari. *Adad-Nirari and \u0160arrup\u0161i are the same person: Daria Gromova suggested that Adad-Nirari was the Amorite name of the king while \u0160arrup\u0161i was his Hurrian name. This was not a unique situation in the Near East when a ruling class had a foreign ethnic roots which was the case in Nuha\u0161\u0161e as the population was West-Semitic while the monarchs had Hurrian names. *Adad-Nirari ruled simultaneously with \u0160arrup\u0161i: Horst Klengel suggested this solution but this does not explain why the treaty of Shattiwaza makes no mention of Adad-Nirari who was the main insurgent from Nuha\u0161\u0161e. *Adad-Nirari interrupted the reign of \u0160arrup\u0161i: also suggested by Klengel who maintained that Adad-Nirari usurped \u0160arrup\u0161i's throne for a short period before being overthrown and \u0160arrup\u0161i reinstated. ===As a possible king of Qatna=== The inventories of Qatna mentions a king named Adad-Nirari; Michael Astour suggested identifying the Qatanite king with the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite monarch and was followed by Richter, who believes that Adad-Nirari ruled Qatna through a \u0161akkanakku (military governor) called Lullu mentioned in the Qatanite inventories. The hypothesis of Richter presents Adad-Nirari of Nuha\u0161\u0161e as the ruler of a vast state, the second Syrian power after Mitanni, who was removed by the Hittites and had his kingdom split into three parts: Nuha\u0161\u0161e itself, Qatna and Ugulzat. The Shattiwaza treaty clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuha\u0161\u0161e during the first Syrian war; If Qatna was part of the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately. Freu rejected Richter's hypothesis; citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuha\u0161\u0161e was a contemporary of Idadnda of Qatna, a successor of the Qatanite Adad-Nirari. ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:14th-century BC rulers Category:Ancient Syria Category:Rulers of Syria ",
