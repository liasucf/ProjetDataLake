    "text": "Pineapple lumps in bulk Pineapple lumps or pineapple chunks are a chocolate- covered confection with a soft, chewy pineapple-flavoured middle from New Zealand. They are often identified as Kiwiana. == History == Charles Diver's original recipe The Regina Confectionery Company in Oamaru first introduced pineapple chunks around 1952\u201354. Charles Diver, the confectionery chief and floor production-manager at Regina who would later formulate other classic Kiwi sweets, had the task of using up waste product from other lollies of the time. One sweet in particular \u2014 an early version of the chocolate fish with a pineapple-flavoured marshmallow middle \u2014 resulted in the most marshmallow left over, which Diver used to create pineapple chunks. The product's name was changed to pineapple lumps by Regina in the early 1960s to give it a more catchy name. Cadbury obtained the pineapple lumps name and began manufacturing and selling them under its Pascall brand. In 1995, Regina was bought by Nestl\u00e9 NZ which shut down the Oamaru factory in 2001. Innovex Holdings purchased the factory from Nestl\u00e9, and in June 2001, established Rainbow Confectionery. Rainbow sells pineapple chunks under its own brand and, in 2013, it also released pineapple chunks based on a slightly-modified version of Diver's original recipe under the Regina brand. Pascall's Pineapple Lumps were the last product manufactured at the Cadbury factory in Dunedin until its closure by Mondelez International in March 2018. Since the sale of all New Zealand- made stock, all Pascall Pineapple Lumps sold in New Zealand have been imported from Australia. == Related products == , Pams markets a product similar to pineapple chunks using the name \"Pineapple Bites\". In 2013, Fonterra released a limited edition Pineapple Lumps-flavoured milk in New Zealand after signing a licensing deal with Cadbury In 2017, Jaffas Lumps were released in New Zealand by Cadbury for a limited time.
