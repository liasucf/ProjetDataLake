In 2015, she won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer at the 62nd National Film Awards for her rendition of the song \"Azhage\" (Beautiful) from the 2014 Tamil film Saivam, a family drama directed by A. L. Vijay. She has recorded the song when she was 7 years old. She received the award at the age of 10, becoming its youngest recipient.\"62nd National Film Awards: Complete list of winners\". IBN Live. 24 March 2015. Retrieved 24 March 2015. ==Biography== Uthara Unnikrishnan is the daughter of Carnatic classical singer P. Unni Krishnan and Bharatanatyam dancer Priya Unnikrishnan. Her father, a recipient of multiple National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer, received his first award in 1995 for his debut performance of the Tamil songs \"Ennavale adi ennavale\" and \"Uyirum neeye\". Uthara began learning Carnatic music at the age of six from Sudha Raja. She studied in Lady Andal school and APL Global school. Apart from Tamil music, she enjoys Western (classical, rock and pop) and wants to master all these genres. ==Songs== \"Azhagu\" (Beauty) was composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, based on raga Kanada. The song describes a child's perception of the beauty around her. The song was penned by Na. Muthukumar, who also received the National Film Award for Best Lyrics. When Uthara Unnikrishnan accompanied her mother Priya Unnikrishnan to Carnatic singer Saindhavi's house during Golu festival, she sang a few lines. A couple of months later, Saindhavi's husband G. V. Prakash Kumar called upon Uthara to croon a solo melody for Saivam. Uthara recorded the song for child actor Sara Arjun when she was eight years old in 2013. Apart from \"Azhagu\", she has sung two more Tamil songs. While praises poured in from many people, singer Pradip Somasundaran criticised the jury's selection, terming the song as having been heavily modified through use of pitch correction software. Uthara later worked on Theri with G. V. Prakash Kumar in the song \"Eena Meena Teeka\". She has also sung the title song Minnamini kunjale of Malayalam TV series Moonumani airing in flowers TV. She also started giving Carnatic concerts like her father. Her recent performance for the Ezhanadu Newspaper (pvt.ltd)'s anniversary in Canada 2017 was much praised by the audience. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Film ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Language ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Song ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes |- | 2014 || Saivam || Tamil || \"Azhagu\" || |- | 2015 || Dagudumootha Dandakor || Telugu || \"Evaru Nearparu\" || |- |2016|| Theri || Tamil ||\"Eena Meena Teeka\"|| |- |2018 |Lakshmi |Tamil |\"Morrakka Mattraakka\" | |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:Tamil musicians Category:Tamil playback singers Category:Indian female film singers Category:2004 births Category:Indian child singers Category:Singers from Chennai Category:21st-century Indian singers Category:21st-century Indian women singers Category:Women musicians from Tamil Nadu Category:Best Female Playback Singer National Film Award winners ",
