DJ Mr. Pao was the turntablist, and he co-produced many of the songs. The other two members were DJ Dax and drummer Scotty. ==Freelance Bubblehead== The group released an album in 1999 titled Freelance Bubblehead, produced by Mickey Petralia. Neil Gladstone of CMJ New Music Monthly thought that the album was \"easy on the ears\" but formulaic. ===Track listing=== #\"Intro\" #\"(Not The) Greatest Rapper\" #\"Kitty Kat Max\" #\"I Love N.Y.\" #\"Rainy Days\" #\"Favorite Things\" #\"Would you Be Mine?
