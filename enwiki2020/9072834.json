    "text": "David H. Ahl (born 1939) is the founder of Creative Computing magazine. He is also the author of many how-to books, including BASIC Computer Games, the first computer book to sell more than a million copies. After earning degrees in electrical engineering and business administration, while completing his Ph.D. in educational psychology, Digital Equipment Corporation hired Ahl as a marketing consultant in 1969 to develop its educational products line. He edited EDU, DEC's newsletter on educational uses of computers, that regularly published instructions for playing computer games on minicomputers. Ahl also talked DEC into publishing a book he had put together, 101 BASIC Computer Games. During the 1973 recession, DEC cut back on educational product development and Ahl was dismissed. He was rehired into a DEC division dedicated to developing new hardware, and his group became caught up in building a computer that was smaller than any yet built, intending to bring the new product into new markets such as schools. DEC built a machine combining a PDP-8 with a VT50 terminal, and another that crammed a PDP-11 into a small portable chassis. When it was presented to DEC's Operations Committee, the engineering side loved it but the sales side was worried it would cut into the sales of their existing lines. The decision ultimately fell to Ken Olsen, who finally stated that \"I can't see any reason that anyone would want a computer of his own.\" With that, the project was dead. Frustrated, Ahl left DEC in 1974, and started Creative Computing, one of the earliest magazines covering the microcomputer revolution.Freiberger & Swaine (2000). Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer (Second Edition), McGraw Hill, . For the next decade Creative Computing covered the whole spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing, and although Ahl sold it to Ziff Davis in the early 1980s, he continued in his capacity as Editor-in-Chief. In 2010, David Ahl helped re-publish a Special 25th and 30th Anniversary Edition of two of his classic programming books, specifically for a new development environment for beginners, called Microsoft Small Basic.Ahl, David, \"Further Thoughts (2010)\" ==References== ==External links== * Basic Computer Games: Microsoft Small Basic Edition \u2014 Special 30th Anniversary Edition Edited by David H.
