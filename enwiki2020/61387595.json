    "text": "Carmen de Luna Villajuan (16 July 1873 \u2013 4 November 1962) was a Filipina educator and co-founded the Centro Escolar University. After completing her own education to train as a teacher, de Luna taught at the private school run by Librada Avelino in Manila and the Pandacan Public Girls' School. In 1907, the two women, along with Fernando Salas founded the Centro Escolar de Se\u00f1oritas, as a non-sectarian educational facility for girls. Acting as assistant director from 1907 to 1934, she assumed the directorship upon Avelido's death and led the university until her own death in 1962. For her work with civic and charitable organizations and lifelong commitment to education, de Luna was honored with the Philippine Presidential Medal of Merit, the Vatican's Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal, as well as recognition from Spain for her work in preserving Spanish culture and language. A historical marker in recognition of her was placed at the Centro Escolar University by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. ==Early life== Carmen de Luna Villajuan was born on 16 July 1873 in San Miguel, Manila, in the Philippine Islands, which at the time was part of the Spanish Empire, to Ignacia Villajuan and Sebastian de Luna. She attended a Catholic boarding school operated by Anacleta Abrera in Binondo, earning her elementary teaching certificate in 1890. To continue her education, de Luna enrolled in the course offered by the sisters of the Assumption Convent, where she met fellow student Librada Avelino, who would become her collaborator and companion for the rest of her life. She graduated in 1894 and that same year passed the government examination to obtain her teaching license as a secondary school teacher. ==Career== In 1896, de Luna's friend Librada Avelino was loaned a property in Santa Cruz in which to open a school. As the school grew, it moved from Fernandez Street to San Sebastian Street and de Luna, and Avelino's cousin Margarita \"Garit\" Oliva joined Avelino, as teachers in the school. At the end of the Philippine Revolution, the school closed because the new United States authorities changed the educational curricula throughout the country requiring that courses be taught in English. In 1901, the two friends traveled to Hong Kong to improve their English and after a 6 month stay, returned to the Philippines. Avelino was employed as the principal of the Pandacan Public Girls' School and de Luna worked for her as a teacher. De Luna continued her education and earned a bachelor's degree of Arts and Sciences in 1907. That same year, DeLuna and Avelino sought the advice of Fernando Salas, a lawyer from a family of educators, about opening a school for women, modeled after the Centro Escolar de Varones (Central School of Men), which Salas was operating. They decided to invest in the founding of a school in Manila which would be called the Centro Escolar de Se\u00f1oritas (Central School of Ladies). Each contributed \u20b1250 and began to organize a non-sectarian school located at 841 Iris Street, later called Azcarraga Street. Avelino, De Luna, and Oliva all intended to teach and they hired other women who had graduated from various normal schools, such as sisters Filomena and Ildefonsa Amor; Constancia P. Arrieta; Maria del Pilar Francisco, the first woman lawyer in the Philippines; and Felisa and Domingo Francisco, cousins of Maria. Salas' teacher candidates included Josu\u00e9 Soncuya, a historian and lawyer; , a journalist and orator; and Alberto Campos, a former soldier in the Spanish army, and a journalist and educator. After proposing his candidates, Salas withdrew from the venture and retrieved his investment funds. The initial board of the Centro Escolar de Se\u00f1oritas included Avelino as director, de Luna as assistant director, Mar\u00eda Francisco as secretary, Felisa Francisco as treasurer and Oliva as administrator. The course offerings which began with girls' education from kindergarten to high school, expanded in 1921 to offer tertiary courses. In 1930, the Centro Escolar de Se\u00f1oritas officially became a university and two years later was incorporated as the Centro Escolar University. When Avelino died in 1934, de Luna took over the direction of the institution and would continue in that post until her own death. After the liberation of the Philippines in World War II, the university became co- educational in 1945, making de Luna the only woman in the country to head a university which taught female and male students.

She worked with numerous civic and charitable organizations including La Gota de Leche and the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat, which operated San Beda College; as well as various Catholic charities. Her work among youth was recognized by President Elpidio Quirino in 1949, who bestowed upon her the Presidential Medal of Merit, the year the honor was inaugurated. That same year, she was honored by Pope Pius XII, who awarded her the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for her leadership and service to the Catholic church. In 1950, she received recognition in the form of a Medal an Diploma of Merit from the Spanish government for her work to preserve the Spanish culture and language of the Philippines. For her lifetime of service as a civic leader and educator, de Luna was recognized by President Carlos P. Garcia in 1961. ==Death and legacy== De Luna died on 4 November 1962 in Manila, Republic of the Philippines. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines affixed a plaque to honor her at the Centro Escolar University in 1973. ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1873 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from San Miguel, Manila Category:19th-century Filipino women Category:Filipino feminists Category:Recipients of the Presidential Medal of Merit (Philippines) Category:Assumption College San Lorenzo alumni Category:Filipino schoolteachers Category:School founders Category:Women founders Category:19th- century Filipino educators Category:20th-century Filipino educators Category:19th-century women educators Category:20th-century women educators ",
