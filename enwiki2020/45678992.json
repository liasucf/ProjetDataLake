In June 2014, the Federal Parliament of Somalia approved a new law formalizing the commission. In March 2015, the Office of the President issued a decree dissolving the extant Judicial Service Commission. It recommended instead reformation of the Commission in accordance with Article 109 of the Provisional Constitution. In late March 2015, the Federal Government began formally reconstituting the Judicial Service Commission. According to the Presidential Adviser on Law Omar Mohamed Abdulle, the new commission is slated to consist of nine members per the constitution. These officials would in turn be chosen from among the extant governmental agencies, as they have the quorum necessary for decision-making and assembly.
