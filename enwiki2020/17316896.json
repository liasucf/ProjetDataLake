The match was the 17th Ukrainian Cup Final and it was contested by Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv. The 2008 Ukrainian Cup FInal was the first to be held outside of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Shakhtar won the match 2\u20130 through goals from Oleksandr Gladkiy and Oleksiy Gai. The match had five red cards issued, two to Dynamo players and three to Shakhtar players. The match also had six yellow cards (Gladkiy received two), four of which were given to Shakhtar players and two to Dynamo players. This was in part because of players' violent behavior and also because referee Victor Shvetsov made several misjudgments. == Road to Kharkiv == All 16 Ukrainian Premier League clubs do not have to go through qualification to get into the competition; Dynamo and Shakhtar therefore both qualified for the competition automatically.
