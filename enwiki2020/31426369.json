    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for solo (vocal or instrumental) country recordings and is limited to singles or tracks only. The award combines the previous categories for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, Best Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Instrumental Performance (if it is an instrumental solo performance). The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between male and female performances.Grammy Awards restructuring ==Recipients== ===2010s=== The first winner of the award is Taylor Swift for her song \"Mean\" in 2012 Carrie Underwood has the most wins (with Chris Stapleton) and the most nominations in this category Chris Stapleton is tied with Underwood for the most wins {| class=\"wikitable\" width=75% |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"10%\" | Year ! width=\"45%\" | Artist ! width=\"45%\" | Work |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2012 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Taylor Swift | \"Mean\" |- | Jason Aldean | \"Dirt Road Anthem\" |- | Martina McBride | \"I'm Gonna Love You Through It\" |- | Blake Shelton | \"Honey Bee\" |- | Carrie Underwood | \"Mama's Song\" |- | rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2013 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Carrie Underwood | \"Blown Away\" |- | Dierks Bentley | \"Home\" |- | Eric Church | \"Springsteen\" |- | Ronnie Dunn | \"Cost of Livin'\" |- | Hunter Hayes | \"Wanted\" |- | Blake Shelton | \"Over\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2014 2015 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Darius Rucker | \"Wagon Wheel\" |- | Lee Brice | \"I Drive Your Truck\" |- | Hunter Hayes | \"I Want Crazy\" |- | Miranda Lambert | \"Mama's Broken Heart\" |- | Blake Shelton | \"Mine Would Be You\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2015 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Carrie Underwood | \"Something in the Water\" |- | Eric Church | \"Give Me Back My Hometown\" |- | Hunter Hayes | \"Invisible\" |- | Miranda Lambert | \"Automatic\" |- | Keith Urban | \"Cop Car\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2016 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Chris Stapleton | \"Traveller\" |- | Cam | \"Burning House\" |- | Carrie Underwood | \"Little Toy Guns\" |- | Keith Urban | \"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\" |- | Lee Ann Womack | \"Chances Are\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2017 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Maren Morris | \"My Church\" |- | Brandy Clark | \"Love Can Go to Hell\" |- | Carrie Underwood | \"Church Bells\" |- | Keith Urban | \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" |- | Miranda Lambert | \"Vice\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2018 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Chris Stapleton | \"Either Way\" |- | Sam Hunt | \"Body Like a Back Road\" |- | Alison Krauss | \"Losing You\" |- | Miranda Lambert | \"Tin Man\" |- | Maren Morris | \"I Could Use a Love Song\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2019 Grammy.com, 7 December 2018 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Kacey Musgraves | \"Butterflies\" |- | Loretta Lynn | \"Wouldn't It Be Great?\" |- | Maren Morris | \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\" |- | Chris Stapleton | \"Millionaire\" |- | Keith Urban | \"Parallel Line\" |- |} ===2020s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=75% |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"10%\" | Year ! width=\"45%\" | Artist ! width=\"45%\" | Work |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2020 https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees- list#8 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Willie Nelson | \"Ride Me Back Home\" |- | Ashley McBryde | \"Girl Goin' Nowhere\" |- | Tyler Childers | \"All Your'n\" |- | Blake Shelton | \"God's Country\" |- | Tanya Tucker | \"Bring My Flowers Now\" |- |} ==Artists with multiple wins== ;2 wins * Chris Stapleton * Carrie Underwood ==Artists with multiple nominations== ;5 nominations * Carrie Underwood ;4 nominations * Miranda Lambert * Blake Shelton * Keith Urban ;3 nominations * Maren Morris * Chris Stapleton * Hunter Hayes ;2 nominations * Eric Church ==See also== *Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance *Grammy Award for Best Country Song *Grammy Award for Best Country Album ==References== == External links == * Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Grammy Awards for country music Category:Awards established in 2012 Country Solo Performance ",
