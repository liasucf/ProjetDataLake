Dafydd Iwan Jones was born in Brynaman in Carmarthenshire, Wales, one of four boys. One of his brothers was the late actor Huw Ceredig. Dafydd Iwan is the elder brother of politician Alun Ffred Jones. His paternal grandfather, Fred Jones, was a member of the Bardic family Teulu'r Cilie, and a founding member of Plaid Cymru. He spent most of his youth in Bala in Gwynedd before attending the University of Wales, Cardiff where he studied architecture. He rose to fame as a singer-songwriter, writing and playing folk music in the Welsh language. ==Musical career== Iwan's earliest material was Welsh translations of songs by American folk/protest singers: Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan until he began to write his first ballads. The most prominent of these were political including the satirical song, \"Carlo\" (\"Charles\"). This was written for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Iwan has also written love ballads and variations on traditional Welsh folk tunes. By the late 1960s, he was receiving television coverage both for his music and for his political activities. He was imprisoned in 1970 for refusal to pay fines for defacing English language road signs as part of the fight for Welsh language rights as a member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith, serving three weeks of a three-month sentence. This event was commemorated in his song \"Pam fod eira'n wyn?\" (\"Why is Snow White?\"). Iwan quickly gained the moniker 'Gast Mawr' ('Rebellious Man') since then. His song \"Peintio'r byd yn wyrdd\"' (\"Painting the World Green\") was regarded as a \"battle hymn\" of the road signs campaign. During the 1970s, his political interests (and songs) took in such themes as Pinochet's Chile; Welsh Devolution; the Vietnam War and the Northern Ireland troubles. Later songs mention events such as the Tiananmen Square massacre (1989), the Gulf War (1990) and opencast mining in the south Wales valleys (1995). \"Yma O Hyd\" (\"Still Here\") was released in 1981. In 1982 and 1983, Iwan embarked on two tours (and accompanying records) with the folk group Ar Log. Around the turn of the millennium, he signalled an end to regular performances, although he remains an occasional performer. In January 2020, Iwan's song \"Yma o Hyd\" (\"Still Here\") reached number one in the UK itunes chart, spurred on by purchases by supporters of Welsh independence group YesCymru. The campaign mirrored the success of the Wolfe Tones song \"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\" earlier that month. ==Public life== Using his architecture studies, in 1971 Iwan was one of the founders of (Gwynedd Housing Association) and was involved in other projects to provide homes for the local population in north-west Wales. Republished at Dafydd Iwan was one of the founders of (Sain Records Ltd), one of the main Welsh music labels. Formerly a Plaid Cymru councillor in Gwynedd he lost his seat in the May 2008 local elections. He blamed his defeat on a dirty tricks campaign by his opponents. Iwan's long service to the Welsh language led to his being made an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod at Bangor in 1971. Iwan escaped a driving ban (for speeding offences) in October 2003 on the basis that he needed to drive for his musical and political duties. Iwan became President of Plaid Cymru in 2003. As part of his campaign seeking re-election as President of Plaid Cymru, Iwan launched a campaign blog 'Dafydd 4 President' in July 2008. On 22 October 2011, Dafydd and his wife Bethan came to watch the Welsh derby, Wrexham FC vs Newport County AFC. Dafydd sang his hit song \"Yma O Hyd\" in front of a crowd of 4,000 before the teams came out. He was invited to sing by the new Wrexham FC Supporters Group, who chose their name 'Yma O Hyd' after his song. ==Albums== Album cover of Dal I Gredu (1991) * Yma Mae 'Ngh\u00e2n (1972) (Here's My Song) * Mae'r Darnau yn Disgyn i'w Lle (1976) (The Pieces Fall into Place) * Carlo a Chaneuon Eraill (1977) (Carlo and Other Songs) * 20 o Ganeuon Gorau (20 best songs) * I'r Gad (1977) (To The War) * Bod yn Rhydd (1979) (Being Free) * Ar Dan (Live) (1981) * Rhwng Hwyl a Thaith (with Ar Log) (1982) (Between Fun and Tour) * Yma o Hyd (With Ar Log) (1983) (Still Here) * Gwinllan a Roddwyd (1986) (Donated Vineyard) * Dal I Gredu (1991) (Still Believe) * Caneuon Gwerin (1994) (Folk Songs) * C\u00e2n Celt (1995) (Celt Song) * Y Caneuon Cynnar (1998) (Early Songs) * Yn Fyw Cyfrol 1 (2001) (Live Volume 1) * Yn Fyw Cyfrol 2 (2002) (Live Volume 2) * Goreuon Dafydd Iwan (2006) (Best of Dafydd Iwan) * Man Gwyn (White Space) (song about the early Welsh emigration to Patagonia and North America) (2007) * Dos I ganu (2009) (Go To Sing) * Cana Dy G\u00e2n (2012) (Sing Your Song) (complete 212 song collection) * Emynau (2015) (Hymns) * O\u2019r Galon (2018) (Because of the Heart) ==References== ==Further references== * C.
