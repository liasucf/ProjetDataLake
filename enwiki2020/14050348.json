Pietro Bettelini (6 September 1763 \u2013 27 September 1829) was a Swiss engraver. ==Life== Bettelini was born in Caslano, and began studying art at a young age. He received instruction from Gandolfi and Bartolozzi; but in his subsequent works he inclined more to the style of Raphael Morghen. He died at Rome in 1828. ==Works== Bettelini was held in high estimation by Thorwaldsen, who employed him to engrave some of his finest works, both figures and bassi-rilievi. His engraving of the Entombment, by Andrea del Sarto, in the Florence Gallery is considered among his finest examples of art. His works include: *Entombment; after Andrea del Sarto. *Madonna col devoto; after the painting by Correggio, in the possession of the King of Bavaria. *Ecce Homo; after Correggio. *St. John; after Domenichino. *Sibylla Persica; after Guercino. *Ascension of the Virgin; after Guido. *Madonna and sleeping Infant; after Raphael. *Judgment of Solomon; after the same. *Magdalene; after Schidone. *Maria div. Sapientiae; after Titian. *The Virgin Mary reading a book; after the same. *Portrait of Galileo. *Portrait of Machiavelli. *Portrait of Poliziano. He worked with Giuseppe Bortignoni the Younger in engraving ceiling decorations from the Vatican.
