    "text": "was a Japanese samurai who lived during the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama and early Edo periods. He was the daimy\u014d of Fukui Domain in Echizen.Nussbaum, Louis- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. (2005). \"Matsudaira Hideyasu\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 616. ==Early life== Hideyasu was born as in 1574, the second son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by Lady Oman (also known as Lady Kog\u014d), a handmaiden to his wife, Lady Tsukiyama. When Oman became pregnant, Ieyasu feared his wife's wrath, so he sheltered the girl in the home of his retainer Honda Shigetsugu, in Ofumi Village near Hamamatsu Castle, and it was there that Ogimaru and his brother were born. Oman is said to have given birth to twins, and that Ogimaru's brother succeeded Oman's father as priest of Chiry\u016b Shrine in Mikawa Province. The young Ogimaru was, for some reason, disliked by his father Ieyasu. It was not until age three that he met Ieyasu, and even that meeting, cold as it was, was not arranged by the father, but instead by Ogimaru's elder half-brother, Matsudaira Nobuyasu. After Oda Nobunaga demanded that Ieyasu order Nobuyasu's seppuku, Ogimaru would have been the next in line to inherit the Tokugawa headship by birth; however, as part of the peace negotiations following the Battle of Komaki-Nagakute, he was given in adoption (in reality as a hostage) to the childless Hashiba Hideyoshi in 1584.Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d\u2019histoire et de g\u00e9ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). \"Matsudaira\" at Nobiliare du Japon, p. 30; retrieved 2013-4-9. Coming of age while living with Hideyoshi, Ogimaru was given the name Hashiba Hideyasu, which combined the names of his adoptive father and biological father. He was also granted courtesy title of Mikawa-no-kami, and his Court rank was Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, raised to Ukonoue-gon-sh\u014dsh\u014d and Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade in 1585 ==Mature years== Hideyasu took part in his first campaign during the Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign of 1587, leading the assault on Buzen-Iwaishi Castle. He also received honors for his distinction in the pacification of Hy\u016bga Province. Hideyasu also took part in the Siege of Odawara (1590) and the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398). His successes in these campaigns earned him respect as an able field commander, despite his youth. However, in 1589, a natural son was born to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Hideyasu had adopted several promising candidates as heir over the years, and began to give these men in adoption to other great houses to avoid a potential conflict over the succession. Hideyasu was given in adoption in 1590 to Y\u016bki Harutomo of Shim\u014dsa Province, and married Harutomo's niece, becoming Y\u016bki Hideyasu and succeeded to the Y\u016bki headship and its 101,000 koku holding. ==Later years== During the Battle of Sekigahara, Y\u016bki Hideyasu was ordered by Ieyasu to remain in his holdings in Shim\u014dsa, possibly because of his pro-Toyotomi sympathies, and possibility because his emergence as a strong military leader might threaten the prestige and position of his younger half-brother, Tokugawa Hidetada. Following the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, he was given all of Echizen Province (670,000 koku) as his fief. In 1604, he was allowed to take the surname Matsudaira.Appert, Georges. (1888). \"Matsudaira\" in Ancien Japon, p. 70; compare Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d\u2019histoire et de g\u00e9ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). Nobiliare du Japon, pp. 29\u201330; retrieved 2013-3-26. In 1605, his court rank was elevated to Senior Third Rank, and his courtesy title to Gon-Ch\u016bnagon. Hideyasu died, possibly from syphilis in 1607, at the age of 34, seven years after the Battle of Sekigahara, eight years before Tokugawa Ieyasu completed the destruction of the Toyotomi clan at the Siege of Osaka. He left a will to his heir urging support for Toyotomi Hideyori even if the Tokugawa decided to attack. His son and heir, Matsudaira Tadanao ignored his father's will and thus the Echizen-Matsudaira clan survived to the Meiji restoration of 1868. ==Family== * Father: Tokugawa Ieyasu * Mother: Lady Oman (1548\u20131620) later Ch\u014dsh\u014d-in * Wife, concubines, children: ** Wife: Tsuruhime, daughter of Y\u016bki Harutomo ** Concubine: Nakagawa no Tsubone later Seiry\u014d-in *** Matsudaira Tadanao *** Matsudaira Tadamasa ** Concubine: ??? *** Kisahime (1598\u20131655) married M\u014dri Hidenari ** Concubine: Gessho\u014din *** Matsudaira Naomasa (1601\u20131666) inherited Matsue Domain ** Concubine: Shinry\u014d-in *** Matsudaira Naomoto (1604\u20131648) inherited Himeji Domain ** Concubine: Nao no Tsubone later Nagaju-in *** Matsudaira Naoyoshi (1605\u20131678) inherited \u014cno Domain ** Concubine: ??? *** Matsudaira Munenori ==References== ==External links== *Fukui City Museum (in Japanese) * \"Fukui\" at Edo 300 * \u8d8a\u524d\u677e\u5e73\u6c0f (Echizen Matsudaira) at ReichsArchiv.jp |- |- Category:1574 births Category:1607 deaths Category:Echizen-Matsudaira clan Category:Shinpan daimyo Category:Tokugawa clan Category:Toyotomi clan Category:Y\u016bki clan ",
