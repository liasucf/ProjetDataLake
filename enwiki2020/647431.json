Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \"games behind\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1933 \u2013 Cole's Chicago American Giants (first half), Pittsburgh Crawfords (second half with better overall)\u2020 *1934 \u2013 Philadelphia Stars\u2020 won best half of season however Crawfords with better whole season record disputed title. *1935 \u2013 Pittsburgh Crawfords\u2020 *1936 \u2013 Pittsburgh Crawfords\u2020 *1937 \u2013 Homestead Grays *1938 \u2013 Homestead Grays *1939 \u2013 Baltimore Elite Giants* *1940 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays *1941 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2020 *1942 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2021 *1943 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2021 *1944 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2021 *1945 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2021 *1946 \u2013 Newark Eagles\u2021 *1947 \u2013 New York Cubans\u2020\u2021 *1948 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays\u2020\u2021 \u2020 \u2013 Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season. * \u2013 Pennant was decided via a 2-round play-off between the top four teams. \u2021 \u2013 Pennant winner went on to play in the Negro World Series. === League play- offs === From 1925 through 1928, and again in 1930, the NNL split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes also occurred in the split season finishes. *1933 \u2013 Cole's American Giants (first half champions) tied Pittsburgh Crawfords (second half champions), 1 tie game *1934 \u2013 Philadelphia Stars (2nd half) beat Chicago American Giants (1st half), 4 games to 3 games, 1 tie *1935 \u2013 Pittsburgh Crawfords (1st half) beat New York Cubans (2nd half), 5 games to 2 games *1936 \u2013 Pittsburgh Crawfords (2nd half) over Washington Elite Giants (1st half), declared \u2013 no games played *1939 \u2013 1st round: Washington Homestead Grays (1st place) beat Philadelphia Stars (4th place), 3 games to 2 games :::1st round: Baltimore Elite Giants (3rd place) beat Newark Eagles (2nd place), 3 games to 1 game :::2nd round: Baltimore Elite Giants (3rd place) beat Washington Homestead Grays, 3 games to 1 game, 1 tie *1941 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays (1st half) beat New York Cubans (2nd half), 2 games to 0 games *1947 \u2013 New York Cubans (2nd half) over Newark Eagles (1st half) *1948 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays (2nd half) over Baltimore Elite Giants (1st half) === Negro World Series === For the duration of the league, a Negro World Series took place seven times, from 1942 through 1948. The NNL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro American League. Five out of the seven years, the Negro National League team (below in bold) prevailed. *1942 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games *1943 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 3 games *1944 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game *1945 \u2013 Cleveland Buckeyes beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games *1946 \u2013 Newark Eagles beat Kansas City Monarchs, 4 games to 3 games *1947 \u2013 New York Cubans beat Cleveland Buckeyes, 4 games to 1 game *1948 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game == References == == Sources == * Category:Negro baseball leagues Category:Defunct baseball leagues in the United States Category:African-American sports history Category:Defunct professional sports leagues in the United States Category:Sports leagues established in 1933 Category:Sports leagues disestablished in 1948 Category:1933 establishments in the United States Category:1948 disestablishments in the United States ",
