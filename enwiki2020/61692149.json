    "text": "Flag Capture is a video game published in 1978 by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600. It is based on the traditional game Capture the flag. The game was designed and programmed by Jim Huether. The cover art for the game was by John Enright. The game was later included with the Atari Flashback 3 console. ==Gameplay== The player is shown a grid with white squares in it and must guess which square the flag is behind. To aid the locating of the flag the player may be shown a flag or a number to indicate where the flag may be. The game may be played in single-player mode, or in a two-player mode where the players play together. ==Reception== The reception both at the time of the release and later has been overwhelmingly negative. Videogamecritic.com in their review criticised the controls, the gameplay, the sound, and the graphics. In Classic Home Video Games, 1972-1984: A Complete Reference Guide Brett Weiss described it as \"one of the most primitive looking (and sounding) games ever\". The game was, among a number of other Atari games, recommended for use in cognitive rehabilitation as it trained co-ordination of visual input with motor output. The game was also used in a psychological test carried out on subjects from the US Navy related to skill-retention. ==References== Category:1978 video games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 2600-only games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
