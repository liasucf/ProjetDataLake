    "text": "Ismael Costa Lekbab (born 8 May 1999), also known as simply Ismael, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Varzim S.C. as a goalkeeper. ==Club career== Lekbab was born to Moroccan parents in P\u00f3voa de Varzim, and raised in the parish of Aver-o-Mar. He came through the ranks of his hometown club Varzim S.C. and made his senior debut with the reserve team in the Porto Football Association's first district league. In May 2019, Lekbab was called up to the first team for the first time due to the suspension of Rafael Broetto, for the penultimate game of the LigaPro season away to C.D. Cova da Piedade on 12 May. He played the game ahead of Emanuel Novo and kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw for the relegation-threatened side. Manager C\u00e9sar Peixoto kept him in goal for the crucial final game at home to Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra, where he was again unbeaten in a 1\u20130 win that kept the team up. On 29 August 2019, Lekbab signed a new contract to last until the end of the 2021\u201322 season. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from P\u00f3voa de Varzim Category:Portuguese people of Moroccan descent Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:LigaPro players Category:Varzim S.C. players ",
