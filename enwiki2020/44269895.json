Another mansion called Routhland was built in its place for Job Routh's daughter, Mary Routh, and her husband, Charles G. Dahlgren, and it later was renamed Dunleith when purchased by planter Alfred Vidal Davis. Alfred Davis sold the property to Hiriam Baldwin in 1866 who died in 1866 and the property was sold to John R Stockton. The property was sold shortly thereafter to Joseph N Carpenter whose family held the property until 1976 Meanwhile, Job Routh's son, John Routh, has become one of the largest cotton planters in the world. From 1815 to 1824, he built this Routhland mansion on his father's land. It is the only remaining mansion under the name of Routhland in Natchez.
