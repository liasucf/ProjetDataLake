Quran Surah Al-Qalam ( Verse 52 ) == Exegesis == The verse refers to an evil eye. This meant that they want to make Muhammad sick and die with a special kind of look.Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn at- Tabataba'i, Tafsir al-Mizan, Raja Cultural Publishing Center, vol.19, p.648.Mahmoud ibn Omar Al-Zamakhshary, Kashaf, Qoqnoos Publication, vol.4, p.597.Fazl ibn Hassan Tabarsi, Majmaolbayan, Publication of The World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought, 2007, vol.10, p.512. It also suggests that the verse is a metonymy for 'very angry glances', as they looked very furiously as if they wanted to kill Muhammad.Husein ibn Ali Abol Fotoh Razi, Rawz ol-Janan and Roh ol-Janan, Islamic Research Foundation of Astan Qods Razavi Publication, 1986, vol.19, pp.370-371.Ismail ibn Omar ibn Kasir, Tafsir ol-Quran al-Azim, Books of Elmiyah Publication, vol.4, P.436. In addition, the grudges of the disbelievers led them to a contradiction. On the one hand, they understood the importance of the Quran insofar as they desired the destruction of the Islamic Prophet, but on the other hand, they accuse him of madness.Mohsen Qara'ti, Tafsire Nour, Cultural center of Quran lessons Publication, 2009, vol.10, p.191. == See also == * Verse of Ikmal al-Din * Verse of Loan * Verse of Wilayah * Warning Verse * Verse of Brotherhood * Verse of Purification * People of Ditch * Muhammad in the Quran * Obedience Verse * Verse of Mawadda == References == Category:Quranic verses Category:Muhammad ",
