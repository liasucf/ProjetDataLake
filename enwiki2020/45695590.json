    "text": "ON Power (Icelandic: Orka n\u00e1tt\u00farunnar), is an Icelandic power company, headquartered in Reykjav\u00edk, that produces and sells electricity to industry and households by harnessing renewable, mainly geothermal, resources. ON Power also provides water for space heating in Reykjav\u00edk and surrounding areas. Traditionally, ON Power's main service area is Reykjav\u00edk and surrounding areas in the south-west part of Iceland, although households and businesses can buy electricity from any supplier in Iceland, regardless of location. == History == ON Power was founded on 1 January 2014 as a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy \u2013 which is owned by the city of Reykjav\u00edk and the municipalities of Akranes and Borgarnes. To comply with Icelandic law no. 65/2003 that effectively call for the de-regulation of the Icelandic electricity market, Reykjavik Energy moved its production and sales of electricity \u2013 including power plants \u2013 into the ON Power subsidiary. == Power Plants == Nesjavellir Geothermal Plant ON Power owns and operates the Nesjavellir and Hellishei\u00f0i Geothermal Plants. The plants provide electricity and hot water to industry and households in Iceland. 99% of housing in the Reykjav\u00edk area is space-heated with hot water provided by geothermal sources. Both plants are situated in the Hengill region; an active volcanic ridge in the south-west part of Iceland. ON also operates the Andak\u00edls\u00e1rvirkjun hydrostation, situated in Borgarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The Nesjavellir Geothermal Plant has been operating since 1990 and the Hellishei\u00f0i Plant since 2006, with a combined output of 423 MWe and 433 MWth. The Andak\u00edls\u00e1rvirkjun has been operating since 1947 and has a total output of 8 MWe. The Elli\u00f0a\u00e1r hydrostation \u2013 commissioned in 1921 \u2013 was operated by ON (and Reykjavik Energy prior to that) until 2013 when Icelandic laws 104/2001 declared the station, including machinery and pipelines, a historic preservation. As a result, the Elli\u00f0a\u00e1r station was decommissioned. == Fast- Charging Stations for Electric Cars == In March 2014, ON Power opened the first DC fast-charging stations for electric cars in Iceland. Electric cars that classified under the CHAdeMO and Type 2 CCS quick charging method can use the stations, free of charge(although pricing will begin in 2017). Most stations also have an AC 43Kw Type 2 charger. Since opening, the network has slowly expanded and now operates 16 fast charging stations. In December 2016, The Icelandic Ministry of Industry and Innovation allocated funding of 57.100.000kr over 3 years to ON in order to set up 14 individual 50Kw DC fast charging stations around the country. ON plan to place chargers around the Ring Road with this funding. As a result, in May 2017 the company opened 3 additional chargers along Route 1 at Sta\u00f0arsk\u00e1li, Bl\u00f6ndu\u00f3s and Varmahl\u00ed\u00f0; completing the route between Reykjav\u00edk and Akureyri.Fast-Charging Station at Selfoss ON operates 16 chargers in the following locations: * Reykjav\u00edk Area(x6) * Reykjanesb\u00e6r * Hellishei\u00f0i Power Station * Selfoss * Akureyri(x2) * Varmahl\u00ed\u00f0 * Bl\u00f6ndu\u00f3s * Sta\u00f0arsk\u00e1li * Borgarnes * Akranes == Emissions from Hellishei\u00f0i == With the geothermal plants situated at Hengill \u2013 an active volcanic area \u2013 emissions of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) are released naturally from the area. Harnessing the geothermal resources has increased the concentration levels of those emissions with the expansion of the Hellishei\u00f0i Plant in recent years. ON Power has worked to reduce those emissions by injecting H2S and CO2 back into the bedrock. The process dissolves H2S in condensate water and injects it back into the high- temperature geothermal reservoir. Once injected, water-rock reactions taking place in the high-temperature geothermal reservoir will mineralize the H2S. This method continues to be tested at industrial scale at the Hellishei\u00f0i Power Plant since early 2014. ==References== * Electricity sector in Iceland * Geothermal Energy * Reykjav\u00edk * Hellishei\u00f0i Geothermal Plant * Nesjavellir Geothermal Plant ==External links== * Official site - www.on.is * Tackling the Challenge of H2S Emissions - Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences * New fast-charging station in downtown Reykjav\u00edk(Icelandic) - November 21, 2014 * First fast-charging station in south Iceland (Icelandic) - September 3, 2014 Category:Electric power companies of Iceland ",
