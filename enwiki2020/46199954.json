    "text": "Daniel Babut (12 February 1929 \u2013 13 February 2009) was a French Hellenist, specialising in Greek philosophy, especially the Moralia of Plutarch. He was employed by the Lumi\u00e8re University Lyon 2 from 1963 to 1992. He was born in Lille. == Work == Daniel Babut dedicated his doctoral thesis, completed in 1969, to Plutarch and his reception of Stoicism. He showed that Plutarch was opposed, consistently and sometimes violently, to Stoic philosophy and made the Stoics his \"chief adversaries.\"D. Babut, Plutarque et le sto\u00efcisme, . \u00bb. The same year he published the text of Plutarch's On Moral Virtue, one of the texts in which he found particularly marked polemic against the stoics, in the Collection Bud\u00e9. Interested in the question of Greek philosophers relationship with the divine, he published a synthesis La Religion des philosophes grecs de Thal\u00e8s aux sto\u00efcismes (The Religion of the Greek Philosophers from Thales to the Stoics) in 1974. His studies were particularly focussed on the place of Anaximander and Xenophanes in the evolution of ideas about the divine.
