    "text": "\"Flaming\" (formerly titled \"Snowing\") is a song by English rock band Pink Floyd, featured on their 1967 debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Written and sung by Syd Barrett, the lyrics describe a childlike game with fantastical imagery (such as unicorns and buttercups), while prominent organ and driving bass guitar carry the uptempo music. The song remained in their set well into 1968, after David Gilmour joined the band and even after Barrett's departure. ==Single== \"Flaming\" was also the third US Pink Floyd single (Tower 378) and was released by Tower Records, but it did not chart. The mono US single mix of \"Flaming\" is slightly edited from other stereo or mono versions of the recording. This US single was released in place of the UK single, \"Apples and Oranges\" (backed with \"Paint Box\"), which had then just failed to break into the UK charts. It was the first of two US Pink Floyd singles released on Tower that were not released on a single in the UK. The other US single that was not released in the UK was \"Let There Be More Light\" b/w \"Remember a Day\" (Tower 440). This song is one of three known Pink Floyd songs to refer to an eiderdown, (better known to Americans as a comforter). The other two songs are \"Julia Dream\", the B-side to a 1968 single, and \"A Pillow of Winds\" from the Meddle album. ==Alternative and live versions== A live version of \"Flaming\" (at that time known as \"Snowing\") was played in London's All Saints Hall in 1966. The song remained a live staple until the end of 1968. A live version of the song, with Gilmour in Barrett's place, was shown on French television. The song opened with a slide whistle played by bassist Roger Waters. ==Personnel== *Syd Barrett \u2013 lead vocals, electric guitar, 12-string acoustic guitar, vocal percussion, wind-up toys *Rick Wright \u2013 Farfisa organ, tack piano, Hammond organ, Lowrey organ, backing vocals, vocal percussion, wind-up toys *Roger Waters \u2013 bass guitar, slide whistle, backing vocals, vocal percussion, wind-up toys *Nick Mason \u2013 drums, finger cymbals, wind-up toys ==References== ==External links== * Category:1967 singles Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:Psychedelic pop songs Category:Songs written by Syd Barrett Category:1967 songs ",
