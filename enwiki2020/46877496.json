    "text": "Coffee plantation in Puerto Rico Coffee production in Puerto Rico has a checkered history between the 18th century and the present. Output peaked during the Spanish colonial rule but slumped when the island was annexed by the United States in 1898. In recent years, the gourmet coffee trade has seen an exponential growth with many of the traditional coffee haciendas of the Spanish colonial period being revived. Puerto Rican coffee is characterized as smooth and sweet. ==History== Coffee was first introduced to Puerto Rico as a minor cash crop during Spanish colonial rule from nearby Martinique, and was mostly consumed locally. By the end of the 18th century, the island produced more than a million pounds of coffee a year. By the late 19th century, coffee production peaked, and the island was the world's seventh largest producer of coffee. Utuado was the most prominent site in coffee production before 1898. This rapid rise in the quantity and quality of coffee produced in the island is attributed to immigrants from Europe who brought their expertise to bear on its growth. In 1898, the United States annexed the island from Spanish control, and it subsequently saw a decline in coffee production, as emphasis was more on growing sugar cane commercially. However, there is now a resurgence of coffee production, with the traditional hacienda estates reopening, and additional areas being brought under the crop. New coffee farms have been started in the Cordillera Central where the nutrient content in the volcanic soil is conducive to high value production of gourmet coffee. ==Production== The island's coffee producing areas are spread throughout Puerto Rico, lying at an elevation range of in the western central mountainous terrain extending from Rinc\u00f3n to Orocovis. There is also potential for growing coffee in the higher elevations in places such as Ponce, with a peak of in elevation. The main areas which produce coffee are in the municipalities of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Lares and Las Mar\u00edas in the northwestern central part of the country. In recent years, production has been affected by factors such as cloud cover, climate change, high cost of production, and the effects of political unrest. It is also reported that about half of the crop remains unpicked because pickers are not available. Coffea arabica is the main variety of coffee grown; popular brands are Bourbon, Typica, Pacas and Catimor. The local consumption accounts for one third of the produce. Coffee from Dominican Republic and Mexico is also imported for local consumption. The exported quantity is, however, very limited. Other local varieties of coffee are Yauco Selecto, Rioja, Yaucono, Caf\u00e9 Rico, Crema, Adjuntas, Coqui, and Alto Grande Super Premium. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== * Types of coins that circulate in Puerto Rico (1508-2017) *www.ElColmado.com offers all the Puerto Rican Coffee from the Island to all customers in the United States. *Puerto Rican Coffee - Antojo Boricua \u2013 Buy Puerto Rican food & coffee online Puerto Rico Category:Economy of Puerto Rico ko:\ud478\uc5d0\ub974\ud1a0\ub9ac\ucf54 \uc694\ub9ac ",
