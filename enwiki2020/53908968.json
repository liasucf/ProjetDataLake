    "text": "Jeremiah 8 is the eighth chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains prophecies attributed to the prophet Jeremiah and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 7 to 10 constitute an address delivered by Jeremiah at the gate of the Temple in Jerusalem.Streane, A. W. (1913), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Jeremiah 7, accessed 4 January 2019 ==Text== The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 22 verses in Christian Bibles, but 23 verses in the Hebrew Bible, Hebrew manuscripts and in the JPS Version, where Jeremiah 9:1 is recorded as Jeremiah 8:23. This article generally follows the common numbering in Christian English Bible versions, with notes to the numbering in Hebrew Bible versions. Verses 1-3 are treated as an extension of chapter 7 by the Jerusalem Bible and by commentator A. W. Streane in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges.Streane, A. W. (1913), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Jeremiah 8, accessed 5 January 2019 ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 4QJera (4Q70; 225-175 BCECross, F.M. apud Freedman, D.N.; Mathews, K.A. (1985). The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll (11QpaleoLev). Winona Lake, Indiana. p. 55) with extant verses 1\u201122, and 4QJerc (4Q72; 1st century BC)\"The Evolution of a Theory of the Local Texts\" in Cross, F.M.; Talmon, S. (eds) (1975) Qumran and the History of Biblical Text (Cambridge, MA - London). p.308 n. 8 with extant verses 1\u20113, 21\u201122 (similar to Masoretic Text). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (with a different verse numbering), made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Verses 10-12 are not included in the Septuagint version. ==Parashot== The parashah sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.As reflected in the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English. Jeremiah 8 is a part of the Fourth prophecy (Jeremiah 7-10) in the section of Prophecies of Destruction (Jeremiah 1-25). As mentioned in the \"Text\" section, verses 8:1-23 in the Hebrew Bible below are numbered as 8:1-22 + 9:1 in the Christian Bible. {P}: open parashah; {S}: closed parashah. : [{P} 7:32-34] 8:1-3 {S} 8:4-12 {P}8:13-16 {P} 8:17 {S} 8:18-22 {S} 8:23 {S} ==Verse 1== : \u201cAt that time,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cthey shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves. NKJV Cross reference: According to the first-century Jewish historian Josephus, Hyrcanus and Herod broke into the sepulchre of David to take the treasures, but the tombs of the kings were inaccessible.Josephus, Antiquitates, vii. 15. 3. \"buried...a thousand and three hundred years afterward Hyrcanus the high priest, when he was besieged by Antiochus, that was called the Pious, the son of Demetrius, and was desirous of giving him money to get him to raise the siege and draw off his army, and having no other method of compassing the money, opened one room of David's sepulcher, and took out three thousand talents, and gave part of that sum to Antiochus; and by this means caused the siege to be raised, ..., after him, and that many years, Herod the king opened another room, and took away a great deal of money, and yet neither of them came at the coffins of the kings themselves, for their bodies were buried under the earth so artfully, that they did not appear to even those that entered into their monuments.\" ==Verse 2== :They shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked, which they have sought and which they have worshiped. NKJV According to Streane, the bones were laid out before the sun and the moon so that \"the objects of their former devotion might look down on the indignities to which those who had served them were subject\". ==Verse 7== :Even the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtledove, the swift, and the swallow observe the time of their coming. ::But My people do not know the judgment of the Lord. NKJV The King James Version refers to the turtledove simply as a \"turtle\";: KJV the name \"turtle\" is derived from , which came originally from Latin tortur, onomatopoeic for the song of the bird (scientific name: Streptopelia turtur)Oxford Living Dictionary, Turtur in \"Turtle dove\", accessed 6 January 2019 and has no connection with the reptile turtle. ==Verse 22== : Is there no balm in Gilead, : Is there no physician there? : Why then is there no recovery : For the health of the daughter of my people?
