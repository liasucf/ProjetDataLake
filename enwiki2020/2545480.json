Instead of using chemical leavening, air is suspended in the batter during mixing to provide volume. Genoise should not be confused with pain de G\u00eanes (\"Genoa bread\") which is made from almond paste, but it is similar to ' (\"Spanish bread\"), another Italian sponge cake.Carole Bloom, The Essential Baker: The Comprehensive Guide to Baking Page 601 2007 \"American sponge cake traditionally has no fat and has a light, airy, delicate texture. It is a close relative of the classic French g\u00e9noise cake, which is made with a small amount of butter. \"Amy Brown Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation - Page 480 2010 \"Unshortened cakes are also known as sponge or foam cakes and include angel food, sponge, meringue, dacquoise, g\u00e9noise, and roulade. The term sponge in food preparation is frequently used to denote foods made with beaten egg whites.\" It is a whole-egg cake, unlike some other sponge cakes for which yolks and whites are beaten separately. The eggs, and sometimes extra yolks, are beaten with sugar and heated at the same time, using a bain-marie or flame, to a stage known to patissiers as \"ribbon stage\". A genoise is generally a fairly lean cake, getting most of its fat from egg yolks, but some recipes also add in melted butter before baking. ==Use and preparation== Genoise is a basic building block of much French p\u00e2tisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise: When finished baking, the sheet is rolled while still warm (to make jelly rolls or b\u00fbches de No\u00ebl), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold to be filled with a frozen dessert. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream. The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes. Genoise cake with buttercream frosting The cake is notable for its elastic and somewhat dry texture and is sometimes soaked with flavored syrups or liqueurs and often served with a buttercream frosting. The popular tiramisu cake may be made with ladyfingers or a genoise sheet. A chocolate genoise can be made by substituting cocoa powder for some of the flour, and is sometimes used as a substitute for the richer cake used in the standard Sacher torte recipe. ==See also== *Castella *Genoa cake *Lamington *Zuppa Inglese *G\u00e2teau magique ==References== *Child, Julia, Julia's Kitchen Wisdom.
