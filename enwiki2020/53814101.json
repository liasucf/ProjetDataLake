    "text": "Imma confluens is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931. It is found in Brazil, Venezuela and French Guiana. The wingspan is 20\u201324 mm. The forewings are white, irregularly mixed with light brownish, and somewhat sprinkled with dark brown. There is a subquadrate dark fuscous spot on the costa near the base and a somewhat inwards-oblique dark fuscous fasciate streak from the costa at one-third to the fold, and a small spot on the costa beyond this. A broad dark brown fascia runs from the costa about two-thirds to the dorsum before the tornus, the anterior edge irregularly convex in the disc, the posterior limited by a rather curved suffused dark line. There is a dark brown blotch on the apical half of the termen confluent with the preceding, the suffusion sometimes extending over the whole posterior area. There is also a terminal series of cloudy dark fuscous dots with obscure pale interspaces. The hindwings are dark bronzy fuscous, lighter anteriorly.Exotic Microlepidoptera. 4: 181. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1931 Category:Immidae Category:Moths of South America ",
