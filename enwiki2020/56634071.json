    "text": "The 2018 Dervish protests were a series of protests by the Iranian Dervishes, who are members of Sufi Islam, in Tehran, Iran. The protests started on 4 February, and calmed down the next day. However, protests flared up again on 19 February, where 3 members of the security forces were killed after being run over by a bus. ==Background== The Gonabadi Dervishes are Sufi Muslims; the Iranian government considers them a threat. Conversion to Sufism is frowned upon by the Shi'a religious establishment. In January, at least 10 of the group's members were imprisoned in Fars province, and others may be held at Evin Prison in Tehran. ==Protests== On 19 February, the Sufis organized a sit- in protest at a police station, located in the Pasdaran district of Tehran, where one of their members was held. Later, clashes broke out between the Sufi protestors and security forces. Police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters. Five riot police were killed. According to the Iranian press, police arrested around 300 people, and there have been reports that some of the protesters may have been killed. However, the Sufi dervishes gathered around the home of their 90-year-old leader Noor Ali Tabandeh to protect him from arrest. In the aftermath of the 19 February, protests, footage emerged that showed several Sufi protesters who were arrested, being tortured by government forces. On 4 March, it was revealed that one of the protesters had died under the custody of the Iranian government. == See also == * Noor Ali Tabandeh * Kasra Nouri * Pouria Nouri ==References== Category:2017\u20132018 Iranian protests Dervish Category:Protest marches Dervish Category:2018 in Iran Category:February 2018 events in Iran Category:March 2018 events in Iran Category:Persecution of Muslims ",
