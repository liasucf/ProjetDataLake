He was born in S\u00e2npetru, Brass\u00f3 County, in what was then the Transylvania region of Austria-Hungary. His parents were Zaharie B\u00e2rsan, a small landowner, and his wife Maria (n\u00e9e Vl\u0103d\u0103reanu). After completing a gymnasium in his native city in 1895, B\u00e2rsan went to the Romanian Old Kingdom. Settling in its capital Bucharest, he earned a degree from Gheorghe Laz\u0103r High School.Justin Ceuca, Zaharia B\u00e2rsan: monografie, p. 8. Editura Dacia, Bucharest, 1978. He subsequently enrolled in the Dramatic Arts Conservatory, studying under Constantin Nottara and graduating in 1901. An employee of the National Theatre Bucharest from that point, he also participated in numerous traveling shows; between 1903 and 1913, he was a central figure of theatrical life in Transylvania. Following the province's 1918 union with Romania, B\u00e2rsan became the first director of the Romanian- language Cluj National Theatre, serving from 1919 to 1927, from 1931 to 1933 and finally from 1934 to 1936. Using a romantic, incantatory style, he performed tragic roles that included Oedipus, Prince Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, Karl Moor and Ruy Blas. B\u00e2rsan's first published work consisted of verses that appeared in Convorbiri Literare in 1897. His poems, which had romantic and S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torist elements, appeared in book form as Visuri de noroc (1903) and Poezii (1907; 1924). His prose books Ramuri (1906) and Nuvele (1909) display marked S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torist tendencies. B\u00e2rsan's most influential writings were his plays: the melodrama Sirena, first performed in 1910, in which the destiny of a maladjusted artist meets that of a domestic lady of the camellias; the 1914 drama Se face ziu\u0103, about the Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an; and the dramatic poems Trandafirii ro\u0219ii (1915) and Domnul de rou\u0103 (1938). His 1908 memoir Impresii de teatru din Ardeal is important both for its literary style and its documentary value.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol.
