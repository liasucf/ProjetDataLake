World Football Golden Soft Sombrero Moment with Vince Grella , The Four Diegos, Retrieved 29 October 2008 Grella built up his reputation in Italy during his time with Empoli, to overcome initial doubts about his suitability to Serie A and earn the respect of the Italian media, coaches and fellow players. Grella was widely linked with a move to A.C. Milan in 2003, although the proposed transfer never eventuated, and he moved to Parma a year later. While at Parma, both Grella and Bresciano were excused from the 2005 Confederations Cup by the then-Australian manager Frank Farina to allow the pair to take part in a relegation playoff between Parma and Bologna\u2013which Parma won, to avoid relegation. Grella was named as captain of Parma for the 2006\u201307 season, and played a key role helping the team avoid relegation from Serie A for a second consecutive season.FIFA Transfer activity gathers pace, FIFA.com, 22 June 2007 On 20 June 2007, Grella signed a three-year contract with Torino, one of several new signings made by The Bull.

The goal was a candidate for goal of the month for January in Serie A.Goal of the Month: January , FootballItaliano.tv, 4 February 2008 It was only the sixth league-goal of his career. ===Blackburn Rovers=== On 26 August 2008, Grella joined English then Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers on a four-year deal, for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be around \u00a34m (with the initial fee later revealed as \u20ac4.2m), having previously been linked to fellow Premiership club Fulham.Fulham target Grella Sky Sports News He joined fellow Australian Brett Emerton at the club. He made his first appearance for the club in a 4\u20131 loss to West Ham United at Upton Park, where he played the first 45 minutes, picking up a yellow card and providing an assist with a header for the only Blackburn goal, before being substituted at half-time for Keith Andrews. A calf injury kept him out of the side for a month following his debut, and he returned to the side in a 1\u20131 draw with Middlesbrough at Ewood Park, playing the full game in the centre of midfield. This was his home debut, and he was later named man-of-the-match for his performance. The following 3 years he spent at the club were a frustrating time for Grella, and Blackburn Rovers fans, with injuries disrupting his stay at Rovers. A succession of knee, groin and calf problems would ultimately rule him out for vast majority of his contract. After the 2010\u201311 season, Blackburn Rovers revealed their desire to transfer Grella. However, with his history of injuries, no offers were made, and he left Blackburn Rovers upon the expiry of his contract at the end of the 2011/12 Barclays Premier League season, a season in which he only made 2 appearances. Over the last 2 years of his contract, Grella was only able to make a total of 9 appearances due to injuries. ===Melbourne City=== On 16 October 2012, he signed with Australian A-League club Melbourne City on a one-year deal.
