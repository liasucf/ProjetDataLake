    "text": "Idalgashinna Railway Station (, ) is the 68th station on the Main Line, located between Haputale and Ohiya railway stations in Badulla District, Uva Province. It is located west of Haputale, at an elevation of above sea level. The station was built after the track was extended in 1893, from the Nanu Oya railway station to Haputale. The broad gauge main line between Haputale and Idalgashinna is regarded to have a notably scenic view due to the land falling away steeply both sides. The view on the northern side of the station extends beyond Boralanda and Welimada up to Udupussellawa and Hakgala, with the southern side encompassing Beragala down to the coast at Hambantota and the Udawalawa reservoir clearly visible. It is serviced by the express trains such as Podi Menike, Udarata Menike and Night mail train, as well as all local trains running on the main line. There are 14 tunnels between the Ohiya and Idalgashinna railway stations. ==Continuity== ==See also== * List of railway stations in Sri Lanka * List of railway stations by line order in Sri Lanka ==References== Category:Railway stations in Badulla District Category:Railway stations on the Main Line (Sri Lanka) Category:Railway stations opened in 1893 ",
