Nelson was then pulled from the card altogether. On October 28, 2010, UFC president Dana White announced that World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) would merge with the UFC and that WEC Featherweight Champion Jos\u00e9 Aldo would be promoted to UFC Featherweight Champion. Josh Grispi was pulled from a planned WEC 52 bout with Erik Koch to challenge Aldo for the Featherweight title at this event. However, Aldo was later forced off the card with an injury. Grispi remained on the card and fought Dustin Poirier. A lightweight bout between Cole Miller and Matt Wiman, which was originally scheduled to take place at this event, was moved to UFC: Fight For The Troops 2.
