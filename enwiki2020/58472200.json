Released on February 23, 2018, the album has received praise from many reviewers. ==Background== The \"Toby Arrives\" album title is in reference to the Hammond organ player Toby Lee Marshall. Dylan Koch insisted that Greg Koch play with Marshall. Greg Koch says his son Dylan Koch insisted he meet Toby Lee Marshall. The three musicians got together to play at a local studio. From that first day the first song on the Toby Arrives cd was written. Greg Koch said. The three musicians first met at a studio that had a B3 organ. During their very first time performing together, Dylan Koch, Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall wrote the title track to Toby Arrives. ==Release and reception== Toby Lee Marshall on September 8, 2018From left, Dylan Koch on drums, Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall September 8, 2018 The album Toby Arrives is entirely instrumental. Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall have each spent the majority of their careers playing instrumental songs. The Koch Marshall Trio's debut album Toby Arrives contains songs that, \"morph into an amazing new relationship with organ influenced Blues Rock.\" The first studio album by the Koch Marshall Trio has received high praise. Pendragon's review of the album borders on hyperbole: \"\u2018Toby Arrives\u2019 is the sort of album you could stack alongside a Thelonious Monk record, a Jeff Beck record or a Mike Landau record. If you went for one of the other three and got this by mistake your day wouldn\u2019t be ruined.\" Scope Magazine's R.M. Engleman had this to say about the Toby Arrives album: \"...the first few songs start off a bit slow, but then the talent kicks in. The three piece organ driven blues release lets you hear a lot of classic and untraditional riffs, both on the keys and guitar. Greg\u2019s playing is a little jazzy, a little funky, and the riffs are untraditionally cool. Believe me, he doesn\u2019t just play scale riffs. A lot of little nuances here with both the B3 and guitar. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Koch Marshall Trio *Greg Koch \u2013 Lead guitar, Rhythm guitar, Vocals *Toby Lee Marshall \u2013 Hammond Organ *Dylan Koch \u2013 Drums ==References== Category:2018 debut albums Category:Koch Marshall Trio albums Category:Mascot Label Group albums ",
