    "text": "Irmgard S\u00f6rensen-Popitz (3 June 1896 \u2013 2 November 1993) frequently known as S\u00f6re Popitz was a German graphic designer who studied at the Bauhaus. == Life == Irmgard S\u00f6rensen was born on July 3 1896 in Kiel. She began painting at an early age, encouraged by her grandmother. In her teenage years, S\u00f6rensen continued to pursue visual arts, going on to attend the craft college in Kiel. In 1917 she matriculated at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig, where she studied graphic arts, drafting, and advertising. After receiving her diploma in 1924, S\u00f6rensen married Friedrich Popitz, a physician. In October of 1924, S\u00f6rensen-Popitz enrolled in the Bauhaus Weimar. In her first semester, S\u00f6re Popitz attended a first year course covering design foundations taught by Moholy-Nagy, Wassily Kandinsky, and Josef Albers. Her other mentors at the school included Jan Tschichold and Paul Klee. After just a semester at the school, S\u00f6re Popitz left the Bauhaus, entering the workforce as a designer in Leipzig instead. Her early departure from the Bauhaus is sometimes cited as a reason she emerged as a graphic designer while other female students did not; while the Bauhaus Weimar had begun to accept female designers, women were frequently encouraged to go into weaving and textile design as opposed to the male dominated fields of architecture and graphic arts. From her departure from the Bauhaus until after the war, S\u00f6re Popitz was frequently employed by Otto Beyer, a publishing house in Leipzig. The majority of S\u00f6re Popitz's Bauhaus-era work and work produced for Otto Beyer were destroyed in the bombing of Leipzig during World War II. S\u00f6re Popitz and her husband moved to Frankfurt following the Soviet occupation of East Germany. Friedrich died in 1949, just a few months after the couple's relocation. In mid 1950s, Popitz returned to painting, abandoning the Constructivism that had characterized her pre-war designs for Informalism. Irmgard S\u00f6rensen-Popitz died in 1993. ==See also== *Ivana Tomljenovi\u0107-Meller == References == Category:Bauhaus alumni Category:German graphic designers Category:1896 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Women graphic designers Category:Artists from Kiel Category:Hochschule f\u00fcr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig alumni ",
