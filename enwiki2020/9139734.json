    "text": "Jean-Lesage is a provincial electoral district in the Capitale-Nationale region of Quebec, Canada that elects members to the National Assembly of Quebec. It consists of parts of the Beauport and La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou boroughs of Quebec City. It was created for the 2003 election from most of the former Limoilou and part of Montmorency electoral districts. Even earlier, before Limoilou, the electoral district of Qu\u00e9bec-Est existed in the same general area. In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, it lost some territory to Montmorency but gained some territory from Taschereau; it also gained a tiny amount of territory from Charlesbourg. It was named after former Quebec Premier Jean Lesage who orchestrated the Quiet Revolution from 1960 to 1966. ==Members of the National Assembly== ==Election results== |} ^ Change is from redistributed results.
