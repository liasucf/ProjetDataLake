Such a practice is now less common due to waste regulations and so some dry docks where ships are broken (to recycle their metal and remove dangerous materials like asbestos) are also known as ship graveyards. By analogy, the phrase can also refer to an area with many shipwrecks which not been removed by human agency, instead being left to disintegrate naturally. These can form in places where navigation is difficult or dangerous (such as the Seven Stones, off Cornwall, or Blackpool, on the Irish Sea); or where many ships have been deliberately scuttled together (as with the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow); or where many ships have been sunk in battle (such as Ironbottom Sound, in the Pacific). As of January 2020, with 30% share India has the highest global revenue and highest share of global ship breaking (number and volume of ships broken), and the world's largest Ship graveyard is in India at Alang.India eyes 60 per cent share of global ship recycling business; higher GDP contribution, Economic Times, 30 December 2019. ==List of ship graveyards== ===France=== *Guilvinec-Lechiagat *On the River Rance *Magou\u00ebr (Plouhinec, Morbihan) *Plouhinec, Finist\u00e8re *Land\u00e9vennec ===United Kingdom=== *The River Tamar downstream of the Royal Albert Bridge used to be used as a mooring site for mothballed vessels, including submarines, of the Royal Navy.
