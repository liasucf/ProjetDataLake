    "text": "== Tour highlights == In the fall of 1983 Bon Jovi played their first show at Madison Square Garden, New York City, supporting ZZ Top. A \"thrilling experience\" for the young band, it gave them the confidence to move forward. Most of the tour, Bon Jovi were the support act for the Scorpions (USA-Tour 1984) and Kiss. However, they headlined at the Syria Mosque Theater, Pittsburgh and the Super Rock Tour in Japan. \"We're known as a hard rock band with a strong and loyal fanbase,\" Jon Bon Jovi reflected in 1987. \"So, even if this all blows up in our face tomorrow, those people who were there for us when we toured with Kiss in '84, and played Donington the next year, will still be there.\" \"Runaway\", \"Breakout\" and \"Get Ready\" grew in popularity with fans as they were most often played during the tour. == Set list == Here is the set-list usually used if Bon Jovi were the main act of the concert: * Breakout * Come Back * Roulette * Shot Through the Heart * Get Ready * Runaway {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
