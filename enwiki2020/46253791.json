    "text": "Arge\u0219 County Museum The Arge\u0219 County Museum () is a government institution and visitor attraction based in Pite\u0219ti, Romania. Formally inaugurated in 1955, it is headquartered in an 1890s palace in the city center. Topics of its permanent exhibits include history, ecology, folk art and minerals. Additionally, a fine arts gallery is located in the former city hall, while three other sites elsewhere in the county are also administered by the museum. ==Background and description== The museum is headquartered at 44 Armand C\u0103linescu Street, in the former Arge\u0219 County Administrative Palace. The structure was built in 1898\u20131899 according to the plans of architect Dimitrie Maimarolu, while Mihail Manolescu was prefect. The land previously belonged to the Buliga skete, and the funds for construction came in the form of a loan of 140,000 lei from a Bucharest bank, guaranteed by the Dimitrie Sturdza-led Liberal government. Done in an eclectic style, it fits within the framework of French academicism. The plan is symmetric and U-shaped, with a basement, ground floor and second floor; the building forms an imposing presence in the city center. The grooved columns are both Ionic and composite. The pediment features symbolic bas-reliefs and acroteria. The cornices are denticulate, there is egg-and-dart moulding, as well as meanders, decorative balustrades, semicircular niches, bossage in strong relief and medallions. Local artist Iosef Materna painted the ceiling of the staircase hall. The building housed the Arge\u0219 County Prefecture from 1899 to 1950, the Arge\u0219 Region Council from 1950 to 1968 and the Arge\u0219 County Council from 1968 to 1970. It has been used by the museum since 1970, and is considered a historic monument by the country's Culture Ministry, Enciclopedia Arge\u0219ului \u0219i Muscelului \u2013 P , at the University of Pite\u0219ti Enciclopedia Arge\u0219ului \u0219i Muscelului site , p. 191-92 as are the adjacent park and public garden. The museum's roots lie in the Gheorghe Ionescu-Gion Popular Athenaeum, which was hosted by a Pite\u0219ti primary school from 1928 to 1946, and by the Arge\u0219 Cultural Center from 1948 to 1950. From 1950 to 1955, its collections were kept in storage. The museum as such was founded in 1955, and was located in the Arge\u0219 Tribunal or Cultural Palace from 1955 to 1957 and in the Fostiropol House or Popular Art School from 1957 to 1970, before moving to its present location. The building was expanded in 2000 and in 2004. Permanent exhibitions include fine arts (1971\u2013), folk art (1971\u2013), history (1974\u2013), ecology and environmental protection (1977\u2013), sports (2008\u2013), a planetarium (2008\u2013), mineral crystals (2009\u2013), numismatics (2009\u2013) and an astronomical observatory.

The museum formerly had charge of D\u00e2mbovicioara Cave (1960\u20132002) and the Liviu Rebreanu Memorial House at Valea Mare (1969\u20132008). The museum has a photographic archive and runs archaeological digs.
