In the same year, teaming up with Masanori Sekiya, he won the JAF Grand Prix All Japan Fuji 500km, held at Fuji.http://www.wspr- racing.com/wspr/results/fld/fld1990.html In 1992, he won the first round of the World Sportscar Championship in Monza in C1, partnering Geoff Lees.http://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/wscc/ms1992.html ==Death== Ogawa was killed in an accident on lap 27 of a Japanese Formula 3000 race held at Suzuka in May 1992. Ogawa aimed to overtake Andrew Gilbert-Scott's car on the main straight, but the latter held his position while Ogawa moved slightly to the side. He clipped the rear left wheel and the front of his car became lodged in the rear bodywork. Both went down the straight at speed and went into the gravel trap, which was insufficient in slowing down either car. Gilbert-Scott spun, hit the tyre wall and flipped, landing upside-down. Ogawa went in nose- first, hit a mound in the gravel trap and was launched over the tyre barrier, hitting a high-fence supporting pole. Both cars were wrecked and the race was stopped immediately. As a result of the accident at least one cameraman, several photographers, and Gilbert-Scott all sustained injuries. Ogawa was freed but had suffered severe leg, head and neck injuries and was pronounced dead on the way to hospital.http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n;=182 ==References== Category:1956 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Japanese racing drivers Category:Japanese Formula 3000 Championship drivers Category:Japanese Formula 3 Championship drivers Category:Racing drivers killed while racing Category:People from Okazaki, Aichi Category:Sport deaths in Japan Category:24 Hours of Le Mans drivers Category:World Sportscar Championship drivers ",
