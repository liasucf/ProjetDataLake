    "text": "Kachasu also known as Lutuku is an illegal traditional distilled beverage from Zambia, Zimbabwe, DR Congo and Malawi consumed mainly in rural parts and poor urban suburbs.https://afrisciheroes.wordpress.com/tag/kachasu/ It is normally brewed from maize though finger millet and various fruits like banana peels can also be used. The process involves adding brewers\u2019 yeast together with the carbohydrate sources such as maize husks to warm water and heating the mixture for a few minutes. The product is then distilled after it has fully fermented. Kachasu's alcoholic content can vary significantly, depending on the strength of the brew and a research on the composition and safety of it conducted in 2001 by the University of Zambia - UNZA academics, found that it contained about 20 to 30% ethanol. Other studies on the beverage have found alcohol contents as high as 70%. == References == Category:Distilled drinks Category:Zambian drinks Category:Drugs in Zambia ",
