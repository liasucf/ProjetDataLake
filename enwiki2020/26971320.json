It is approximately 100 kilometers long. The Markarflj\u00f3t rises in the Rau\u00f0afossafj\u00f6ll massif, east of the volcano Hekla. The main sources for the river are the glaciers M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull and Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. It flows through narrow gorges in the mountainous area between the glaciers Tindfjallaj\u00f6kull and Torfaj\u00f6kull, then spreads in the wide sandur plains at Iceland's south coast, near \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk. The Markarflj\u00f3t takes its course first north, then west of \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk and finally empties into the Atlantic west of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. One of the Markarflj\u00f3t's tributaries is the river Kross\u00e1, flowing through \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk, which is notorious for sudden changes in its water level. The highest discharge ever measured in the Markarflj\u00f3t was in 1967, during the Steinholt j\u00f6kulhlaup. The first bridge over the river was opened in 1934 near Litli D\u00edmon. It is 242 meters long and was at the time the longest bridge in Iceland. A second bridge was built in 1978 at Emstrur. A third bridge was opened in 1992 a few kilometers south of the first bridge.http://www.utivist.is/skalar/basar_a_godalandi/leidarlysing_inn_ad_godalandi/ == References == Category:Rivers of Iceland Category:Southern Region (Iceland) ",
