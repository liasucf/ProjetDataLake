The district consists of portions of Columbus including Hilltop, Franklinton and the Southside as well as Valleyview and Marble Cliff in Franklin County. ==Life and career== Miller was born in Columbus, Ohio and is the fourth-generation of his family to call the Hilltop neighborhood home. He is a graduate of Capital University, and today is a partner with Taft, Stettinius & Hollister. In 1998, Miller ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress against Deborah Pryce.

He did a tour of Afghanistan in 2004 and another in 2020. Formerly, Miller served on the Grandview Heights City School Board. He is married with two children and resides in Marble Cliff. ==Ohio House of Representatives== In 2016, Representative Michael Curtin decided not to seek a third term. Opting to seek the Democratic nomination, Miller defeated Matt Jolson 58% to 42%. This was despite Miller not being endorsed by the Franklin County Democratic Party. In a safely Democratic seat, Miller won the general election against Republican John Rush by only a 54% to 46% margin, much closer than anticipated. Miller is only the second person to hold this seat, after Curtin, since it was established in 2013. == References == ==External links== *Ohio State Representative Adam Miller official site Category:Living people Category:Capital University alumni Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Ohio Democrats Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Politicians from Columbus, Ohio Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
