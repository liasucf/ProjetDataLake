Established in 1861, it is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. == History == The site was purchased by John Batman in 1837 at Melbourne's first Crown land sale. On the site was built a home for his children, which became a schoolhouse in 1839. Warehouses were erected on the site after the schoolhouse was razed in 1853. The Princes Bridge Hotel opened there on 1 July 1861 by John P. Toohey and his brother who later went on to found the Tooheys Beer brand. The Hotel was renamed to Young and Jackson after the Irish diggers who took it over in 1875, cousins Henry Figsby Young (b. 1849 Dublin, Ireland - d. 29 September 1925), ...DEATHS...YOUNG.\u2014 On the 29th September, at his residence, \"Normanhurst,\" Brighton-road, Elsternwick, Henry Figsby Young, aged 82 years...., ...MARRIAGES...YOUNG-RAMSAY.-On the 21st May, at Holy Trinity Church, E.

The freehold was owned by the Koegh family for 123 years until it was purchased by Marcel Gilbert in 1979. The hotel is an amalgamation of five separate buildings of two and three storeys, with the original 1853 bluestone building designed as a three-storey residence, with a butcher's shop on the ground floor. It was later extended in both directions, with all buildings rendered and painted to match each other by the 1920s. Since the 1920s the exterior hotel has been dominated by large advertising signs, even to this day. ==Chlo\u00e9== Chlo\u00e9 by Jules Joseph Lefebvre The hotel is well known for the nude painting Chlo\u00e9, painted by French artist Jules Joseph Lefebvre in 1875. The painting is oil on canvas measuring a life size 260 x 139 cm. It was purchased for 850 guineas by Dr Thomas Fitzgerald of Lonsdale Street in Melbourne. After being hung in the National Gallery of Victoria for three weeks in 1883, it was withdrawn from exhibition because of the uproar created especially by the Presbyterian Assembly. It was bought for the Young and Jackson Hotel in 1908 for 800 pounds, and was damaged in 1943 by an American serviceman who threw a glass of beer at it. ==See also== * List of public houses in Australia ==References== * * == External links == * *Bar Project *Only Melbourne *Young and Jackson Hotel, historic images and social history at Culture Victoria Category:Pubs in Melbourne Category:Melbourne City Centre Category:Landmarks in Melbourne Category:Organisations based in Melbourne Category:1861 establishments in Australia Category:Heritage-listed buildings in Melbourne ",
