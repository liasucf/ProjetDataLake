    "text": "Halil Turgut \u00d6zal (; 13 October 192717 April 1993) was a Turkish politician who served as the 8th President of Turkey from 1989 to 1993. He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982. After working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large- scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National Salvation Party (MSP) candidate from \u0130zmir. In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater economic liberalism of the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy. \u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Turks in Bulgaria to return to Turkey. \u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear. ==Early life and career== Turgut \u00d6zal was born in Malatya of Kurdish descent. He completed elementary school in Silifke, middle school in Mardin, and high school in Kayseri. \u00d6zal studied electrical engineering at Istanbul Technical University, graduating in 1950. Between 1950 and 1952, he worked at the State Electrical Power Planning Administration and continued his studies in the United States on electrical energy and engineering management between 1952\u20131953. After his return to Turkey, he worked in the same organization again on electrification projects until 1958. \u00d6zal was in the State Planning Organization in 1959, and in the Planning Coordination Department in 1960. After his military service in 1961, he worked at several state organizations in leading positions and lectured at ODT\u00dc (Middle East Technical University). The World Bank employed him between 1971\u20131973. Then, he was chairman of some private Turkish companies until 1979. Back to the state service, he was undersecretary to the Prime minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel until the military coup on 12 September 1980. ==Political career== The military rulers under Kenan Evren appointed him state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs until July 1982. ===Motherland Party era=== On 20 May 1983 he founded the Motherland Party () and became its leader. His party won the elections and he formed the government to become the 19th Prime minister on 13 December 1983. In 1987 he again became prime minister after winning elections. He became the head of the transformation of the social and economic outlook of Turkey which led by the Motherland Party due to the wider global trend of neo- liberal transformation with anti-labor-union discourses. ===Assassination attempt=== Turgut \u00d6zal and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez at Moncloa Palace, September 1989. On 18 June 1988 he survived an assassination attempt during the party congress. One bullet wounded his finger while another bullet missed his head. The assassin, Kartal Demira\u011f, was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment but pardoned by \u00d6zal in 1992. Demira\u011f was allegedly a Counter-Guerrilla, contracted by the movement's hawkish leader, General Sabri Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu. Two months later, Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu became the Secretary-General of the National Security Council. During Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu's tenure as secretary general, \u00d6zal heard about the allegations of Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu's role in the affair and forced him into retirement. In late 2008, Demira\u011f was re-tried by the Ankara 11th Heavy Penal Court and sentenced to twenty years in prison. In 2013 \u00d6zal's son Ahmet \u00d6zal said that several months before the assassination attempt \u00d6zal had survived a plane incident in which his official plane lost an engine and crash-landed. The manufacturer later reported a 95% probability that the plane would have exploded under the circumstances present.Today's Zaman, 24 April 2013, \u00d6zal's little known near plane crash finds way into indictment ===Presidency=== George Bush in Istanbul. On 9 November 1989, \u00d6zal became the eighth president of Turkey elected by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the first president to be born in the Republic of Turkey rather than the Ottoman Empire. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, \u00d6zal made an effort to found alliances with the Turkic countries of Central Asia as well as Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. President Turgut \u00d6zal agreed to negotiations with the Kurdish PKK. Apart from \u00d6zal, himself half-Kurdish, few Turkish politicians were interested, nor was more than a part of the PKK itself. A first round occurred in the early 90s, and led to a cease-fire declaration by the PKK on 20 March 1993. After the president\u2019s death on 17 April 1993, in suspicious circumstances, the hope of reconciliation evaporated, and the Castle Plan, which \u00d6zal had opposed, was enacted. Some journalists and politicians maintain that \u00d6zal's death was part of a covert military coup in 1993 aimed at stopping the peace plans. \u00d6zal supported the coalition against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. He is also called as \"fatty of the \u00c7ankaya, the workers\u2019 enemy\" () due to his statements and his role in the authoritarian populist policies against 1990 \u201cZonguldak Strike\" of the coal miners. In 1991 he said that \"Bulgaria will be ours, but this time we are going to buy it\".http://www.voininatangra.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=252 In February 1991, he was made an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia's highest civilian honour, \"for eminent service to Turkish/Australian relations\".

He wanted to reach an agreement with the Armenians and solve the problem as soon as possible by making compromises. The reason for this was his first confrontation with the topic of the so-called genocide in the 1950s while he was still studying in the United States. \u00d6zal noticed an emerging Armenian lobby which aimed to introduce the recognition of the so-called Armenian Genocide on the political agenda in the United States.Late President Turgut \u00d6zal worked to solve \u2018So- called Armenian genocide\u2019 dispute . Today's Zaman. 23 April 2012. Retrieved 4 November 2013 When he became prime minister in 1983, the Armenian issue was one of the topics on his agenda. However, he faced tough challenges as the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) intensified its attacks on Turkish diplomats abroad in the early 1980s. The ASALA factor made it very difficult to take any bold steps in domestic politics with respect to bridging the gap between Turks and Armenians. Behind closed doors, \u00d6zal defended the idea of holding negotiations with Armenians to settle a dispute that has had great potential to deal a serious blow to Turkish interests in international politics In 1984, \u00d6zal tasked his advisers to work out different scenarios of the political and economic costs that Turkey would have to incur if it would agree to compromise with the Armenian diaspora and recognize the Genocide. In 1991, after a meeting with representatives of the Armenian community, \u00d6zal said in front of journalists and diplomats: \u00d6zal tried to implement several projects, including the \"Van project,\" as part of his solution to the Genocide issue. The Van Project envisioned the return of some lands to Armenians in Van. However, \u00d6zal was unable to make concrete progress because his policies sparked criticism and fury among the Turkish public, the Motherland Party, and the Turkish military as they considered the idea of negotiating with the Armenian diaspora itself as unacceptable and unthinkable. After \u00d6zal's death, his policies of compromising with the Armenians in order to solve the conflict concerning the Armenian genocide were abandoned. ==Death and exhumation== On 17 April 1993 \u00d6zal died of a suspicious heart attack while still in office, leading some to suspect an assassination. \u00d6zal had first become ill a month earlier. He died just before he had the chance to negotiate with the Kurdish rebel organization, the PKK. His wife Semra \u00d6zal claimed he had been poisoned by lemonade and she questioned the lack of an autopsy. The blood samples taken to determine cause of death were lost or disposed of. \u00d6zal had sought to create a Turkic union, and had obtained the commitment of several presidents of the newly independent Turkic states from the former Soviet Union. His wife Semra alleged that the perpetrator might have wanted to foil the plan. Hundreds of thousands of people attended the state burial ceremony in Istanbul, in which \u00d6zal was buried next to the mausoleum of Adnan Menderes. Among those attending were dignitaries of 72 countries, including several heads of state and government, such as Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, and Azerbaijani President Abulfaz Elchibey attended the funeral, as well as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. On the fourteenth anniversary of his death, thousands gathered in Ankara in commemoration. Investigators wanted to exhume the body to examine it for poisoning. In September 2012, a court ruled that the grave be opened for another autopsy. On 3 October 2012 his body was exhumed. It contained the banned insecticide DDT at ten times the normal level.Doktorlar\u0131n\u0131n ve ailesinin a\u011f\u0131r ihmalleri var in Zaman 2012-11-26 According to press reports, the \"partially embalmed\" remains were found to be well preserved, much to the experts' and public's surprise. It is reported that while the lower half of the body was subject to skeletonization, the upper half was preserved due to adipocere. An autopsy report issued on 12 December 2012 stated his body contained poison but the cause of death was unclear.Today's Zaman, 20 June 2013, Independent expert evaluation casts doubt on \u00d6zal report A trial charging retired general Levent Ers\u00f6z with his murder began in September 2013 who eventually was cleared of all charges.Today's Zaman, 11 September 2013, Trial into suspicious death of late president \u00d6zal begins ==Family and personal life== With his wife Semra, \u00d6zal had two sons, and a daughter. One of their sons, Ahmet \u00d6zal, was elected to parliament after the elections of 1999, but stayed out after the elections of 2002.
