He was then appointed to the more important court of Hyderabad State from 1810 until 1820, when he retired to England. Russell was Private Secretary and assistant to James Achilles Kirkpatrick, British Resident at Hyderabad from 1798 until his death in 1805. Russell's career is discussed in some detail in William Dalrymple's 2002 history of British India, White Mughals, where he figures as a gifted but weak diplomat who, following the death of his superior, Kirkpatrick, seduced then abandoned Kirkpatrick's widow. Russell resigned the Residency in 1820 to avert an investigation for corruption which would have led to his removal from office in disgrace. On an annual salary of \u00a33,400, he had managed to accumulate a fortune of \u00a385,000 over 10 years. In retirement he lived first at Sutton Park in Bedfordshire, then at Southernhay House, an architecturally notable listed building in Exeter. It was a newly built, freestanding, classical mansion of pillared grandeur. ==Marriages and Children== In October 1808 he married Jane Amelia Casamajor in Madras who died suddenly just two months later. A subsequent liaison with a local lady resulted in the birth of his daughter, who he named Mary Wilson in 1815. This child was brought to England when he retired, and was brought up in complete secrecy, with Sir Henry's friend, Major Robert Pitman, acting as go-between. He provided an allowance for her, but refused to let Major Pitman tell her the identity of her father. https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/uploads/Correspondence%20between%20Sir%20Henry%20Russell%20(1783-1852)%20Major%20Robert%20Pitman%20and%20Mary%20Wilson.pdf.
