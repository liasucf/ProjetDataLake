    "text": "Drosophila elegans is a flower-feeding species of fruit flies, belonging to the family Drosophilidae. It is found in Taiwan and the Philippines in Asia. It belongs to the Drosophila melanogaster species group where it forms it own subgroup. There are two morphs (brown and black) of the species. The difference is due to the percentages of 7-pentacosene and 9-pentacosene on the cuticle.Sexual isolation and cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila elegans. K Ishii, Y Hirai, C Katagiri, MT Kimura, Heredity, 2001 As a lab model species, it requires banana-opuntia-protein food. Its genome has been sequenced in 2011. The name was also used for a fossil (\u2020Drosophila elegans Statz, 1940) from the Upper Oligocene of the Rott Formation in Germany.Neue Dipteren (Brachycera et Cyclorhapha) aus dem Oberoligoz\u00e4n von Rott. G Statz, Palaeontographica Abteilung A, 1940, 91, pages 120-174 The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled for the name to be conserved for the extant species by suppression of its unused senior homonym (replaced by \u2020Drosophila statzi Ashburner and Bachli, 2006).OPINION 2143 (Case 3306) Drosophila elegans Bock & Wheeler, 1972 (Insecta, Diptera): specific name conserved at the International Commission of Zoological NomenclatureDrosophilidae (Diptera).
