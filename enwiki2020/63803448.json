In 2020, he became a Queensland Music Awards winner in the world music category and has been identified as \"one of the freshest feeling projects in Australian music right now.\" Matt is also known as the co-founder, trumpet player and songwriter for the folk punk band The Mouldy Lovers. Matt's 2019 debut album 'The Shirt Album' is notable for having been released \"in the form of an organic fair-trade T-shirt in place of a CD\" with the aim of reducing potential plastic waste. The album features collaborations with noted Tibetan musician Tenzin Choegyal, Triple J Unearthed Sprung Hip Hop winner Blaq Carrie, and Japanese musician Kenta Hayashi. As a 'one-person orchestra' he has performed at TEDx and Australia's BIGSOUND Festival, and has been featured on SBS World News. ==References== Category:Australian singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
