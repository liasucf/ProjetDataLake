    "text": "The New Shetlander is Scotland's longest-running literary magazine, founded in 1947, and edited originally by Peter Jamieson. Priced at \u00a32, it has had a central role in Shetland's Literature since it was founded. For the greater part of its existence thus far, 1956 till 1998, the NS benefited from the tender editorial care of the brothers John J. Graham and Laurence I. Graham. In 1998, Alex Cluness and John Hunter took on the onerous task of following such a sterling team, after whom the Shetland Archivist and historian Brian Smith and the author Laureen Johnson followed. The New Shetlander is a quarterly magazine. In 2007 it celebrated its 60th anniversary, by publishing issue number 239 and it celebrated issue 250 just recently. The archive is a true treasure trove of varied material, reflecting the many changes Shetland has gone through since World War II. The New Shetlander\u2032s head office is located at Market House, Market Street, Lerwick, Shetland. ==External links== * New Shetlander Category:1947 establishments in Scotland Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1947 Category:Literary magazines published in Scotland Category:Mass media in Shetland ",
