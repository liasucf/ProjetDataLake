The line connects with the Nagoya Line and Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line at Kintetsu- Yokkaichi Station. ==History== ===Yokkaichi Railway=== The Yunoyama Line was originally conceived and built by ) in the 1910s. It was constructed with the purposes of providing access in the city of Yokkaichi and providing tourists access to the Yunoyama area. The line was completed in 1913 and in 1916 an extension from the line's origin, (at that time called Suwa Station and located slightly to the east), to JR was added. However, this extension had a relatively short life as part of the Yunoyama Line as it was sold to Ise Electric Railway (Iseden) in 1927, who used it for the extension of their main line from Yokkaichi to . This made Suwa Station, a hub between three private railways and the biggest station in Yokkaichi, the origin again. Steam engines originally ran on the tracks; in the 1920s the line was electrified, following a trend of many railways in the area. Ownership of the line has shifted. Yokkaichi Railway created the line. It was absorbed by Mie Railway (Santetsu) in 1931, who built and operated the nearby Utsube Line which also originated from Suwa Station at that time. Then in 1944, Santetsu, with six other companies, merged to form Mie Transport (Sanco). Twenty years later, the railway department of Sanco split off to become a separate company called Mie Electric Railway (Sanden). This organization was short-lived as it was bought up by railway giant Kinki Nippon Railway (Kintetsu) the following year, and thus in 1965 the line came under its current name and ownership. ===Renovation=== In 1954 the beginning of the route received a significant re- routing at the hands of Sanco, the owner. The Nagoya Line suffered from many sharp curves on its way through Yokkaichi to Suwa Station. Kintetsu developed a plan to straighten the line as well as enlarge Suwa Station, which would be moved about a kilometer to the west. Construction began in 1952 and took a few years to be completed. In accordance with this plan, Sanco altered its own Yokkaichi-area railways in 1956 to use the new location of Suwa Station, which was renamed to Kintetsu-Yokkaichi Station. From Nakagawara Station, the track that ran to the old Suwa Station was closed and a new track was built to Kintetsu-Yokkaichi. After this new section was completed, the Yunoyama Line originated from the part of Kintetsu-Yokkaichi Station where the Utsube Line still originates today; the two lines had the same track gauge at that time and connected directly with each other. About 10 years later, in 1964, when Sanden took over the railway, more improvements were carried out even though Sanden only owned the line for about one year. Yokkaichi Railway constructed the line with an especially narrow gauge of . In the interest of direct connection with the Kintetsu Nagoya Line, the technical specs of the line were altered to match those of the Nagoya Line; the Yunoyama Line gauge was widened to and the voltage was increased to 1500 V. These changes severed the direct connection with the Utsube Line, however, direct connection with the Nagoya Line, a major railway trunk line, was seen as more beneficial. When Kintetsu acquired the line the following year, it was relatively painless to tie the two lines together and it soon began offering limited express service directly from in Osaka and to Yunoyama, aimed at attracting tourists to the onsen and nearby Mount Gozaisho. This service was offered for over 30 years but was ceased in 1998 due to insufficient ridership. Limited express trains that originated at Kintetsu-Yokkaichi continued to run the length of the Yunoyama Line for a few more years, but this service was ended in 2004. The Yunoyama Line is notable because it is the only one of Kintetsu's many small branch lines to have offered limited express service. ===Timeline=== *June 1, 1913 \u2013 Kawashimamura (now Ise-Kawashima) ~ Yunoyama (now Yunoyama-Onsen) section opened by Yokkaichi Railway. *September 24, 1913 \u2013 Suwa (now Kintetsu- Yokkaichi) ~ Kawashimamura section opens. *March 3, 1916 \u2013 Yokkaichi (Kokutetsu) ~ Suwa section opens. *November 1, 1921 \u2013 Entire line electrified. *November 29, 1927 \u2013 Yokkaichi \u2013 Suwa section closes.
