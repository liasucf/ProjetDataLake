    "text": "August Cieszkowski Street belongs to architecturally remarkable streets of Bydgoszcz, with its Art Nouveau features from the Fin de si\u00e8cle period, forming a homogeneous complex of tenements from the end of 19th-century beginnining of 20th century, most of which are registered on Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. ==Location== The street is located in the middle Downtown district in Bydgoszcz, connecting on a southeast - northwest axis Gda\u0144ska Street to Pomorska Street. At its south-eastern end stands an Evangelical Methodist Church, and its opposite tip aims at the so- called Bydgoszcz Musical District. ==History== The establishment of the street is associated with the dynamic development of the city in the second half of the 19th century. The location of Bydgoszcz Main train station, away from the current center of Bydgoszcz in 1851, eased the urban expansion of the city to the north and north-west. After the construction of new quarters along Gda\u0144ska Street, Dworcowa Street and Pomorska Street, another expansion phase occurred among perpendicular short side streets. 1894 is the first date referring to Moltkestra\u00dfe, today's Cieszkowski Street, with its lavish buildings erected during economic boom and the consequent revival of construction activity in Bydgoszcz. New frontages were built on a grand scale, using the nascent Art Nouveau design. Special attention has been given at the time to street equipment praised by the local establishment: paving, wide sidewalks with granite, street lighting (gas, then electrical after 1900). Buildings have been completed within a decade, making August Cieszkowski street a place gathering luxurious tenement houses designed by renowned architects in Bydgoszcz: * Karl Bergner; * J\u00f3zef \u015awi\u0119cicki; * Paul B\u00f6hm; * Carl Meyer; * Rudolf Kern, * Fritz Weidner. Frontages present a variety of stylistic trends, both traditional (Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque) and avant-garde (Historicism, Secession, Modernism). First houses were completed in 1897, but most of the construction work took place between 1900 and 1903. In 1904, the road had already received a full equipment: forged fences along the northern frontage, pavement including porphyry , walkways, sewer system and gas street lighting. Among residents and landlords -during both the Prussian period (till 1920) and the interwar- were senior officials, merchants, businessmen, teachers and officers. After 1990, most of the street buildings have undergone repair and restoration. Since 2008 the \"August Cieszkowski Street Residents Association\" organizes its annual festival \"U-Rodziny Augusta Cieszkowskiego\" (In the Family of August Cieszkowski), promoting cultural integration and bringing street residents and tourists. In 2011, the municipal council decided, as part of the revitalization plans, to build a parallel street, \"Nowomazowieckiej St.\", which should relieve the heavy traffic transit in Cieszkowski Street. == Architecture == August Cieszkowski Street is considered as a showcase of architecture in downtown Bydgoszcz, exalting the style and spirit of Belle \u00c9poque. Street frontages are an example of the coexistence of classical forms with avant-garde style. Facades have been designed by the elite architects in Bydgoszcz in the late 19th and early 20th century, including: * J\u00f3zef \u015awi\u0119cicki, his projects are based on Eclecticism, combining dominant forms and historizing elements (Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque); * Karl Bergner who designed Eclecticism styled houses with interspersed Art Nouveau details, as was done in Berlin; * Fritz Weidner, Rudolf Kern and Paul B\u00f6hm were influenced by Historicism, and were following new, avant-garde, stylistic choices (Secession, elements of Modernism). Oldest buildings are located at the intersections with Gda\u0144ska Street and Pomorska Street and display Eclecticism forms with details Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque. In younger buildings, especially those erected after 1900, traditional stucco decorations on the facades are reduced to the benefit of enriching architectural forms. Buildings show asymmetrical facades, irregular shapes, with picturesque towers and merging bay windows. These forms are topped with magnificent gables, stressing the picturesque character. In all facades decoration appears stylized and simplified motives, in line with the new trends in art in the late 19th and early 20th century: acanthi, rococo details, Rose windows, herms and others. Most developed sculptural allegorical decorations on houses facades are geometric and floral ornaments, initials, cartouche symbols and carved figural sculptures. The symbolism used generally refers to the house as a \"home\", a place of peace and rest, and points out the passing and contemplation of life. == Main places and buildings == ===J\u00f3zef \u015awi\u0119cicki's mural=== In November 2018, the city of Bydgoszcz honored the memory of the architect by dedicating a mural to J\u00f3zef \u015awi\u0119cicki and his works, on a wall located at the corner of Gda\u0144ska and Cieszkowskiego streets, in front of his former house File:J Swiecicki mural.jpg|\u015awi\u0119cicki's mural ===House at N\u00b01=== Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N\u00b0601268, Reg.A/1104 (October 18, 1993)Za\u0142\u0105cznik do uchwa\u0142y Nr XXXIV/601/13 Sejmiku Wojew\u00f3dztwa Kujawsko- Pomorskiego z dnia 20 maja 2013 r. 1903\u20131904, by Paul B\u00f6hm Art Nouveau Construction costs exceeded the initial estimations (40,000 DM) and were covered by the architect who hoped to profit from the sale of the finished property.

The ground floor was devoted to retail stores and the rest was a four-storey apartment. A full revitalization of the house, bringing back original facade appearance with reconstructed architectural details and original colors, has been carried out in 1993\u20131994.

In 1895, in the same location, the architect Fritz Weidner designed another tenement on behalf of Wilhelmin Wiemer, owner of the lot.

The ground floor was devoted to shopping and restoration retail and upper floors for housing. On October 11, 1936, Richard Klewin, a dentist, acquired the building.Odpis z Ksi\u0119gi Wieczystej nr 3922/Bydgoszcz, tom 32, wykaz 1212.

The corner, capped by a spired roof lantern, is flanked on the top with triangular gables with dormer windows. The second floor bay- window is an open arcaded loggia supported by Ionic columns.
