Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 10: 302-303 in LatinTropicos, Poranthera Rudge It is one of eight genera in the tribe Poranthereae.Maria S. Vorontsova and Petra Hoffmann. 2008. \"A phylogenetic classification of tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae).\" Kew Bulletin 63(1):41-59. Its closest relative is Pseudophyllanthus. Poranthera is native to Australia and New Zealand.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The name is derived from the Greek word, poros, \"opening or pore\", and the Latin word anthera, \"anther\".Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. volume III,. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, Washington DC, USA; London, England. (vol III). (see External links below) Poranthera consists of monoecious or rarely, dioecious annual or perennial herbs. On the anthers, the line of dehiscence does not extend beyond the apex. It does not have the clearly round pores that define truly poricidal dehiscence. Poranthera alpina has been placed in the monospecific genus Oreoporanthera by some authors, but in 2007, a molecular phylogenetic analysis of matK and ITS sequences showed this species to be embedded in Poranthera.Maria S. Vorontsova, Petra Hoffmann, Olivier Maurin, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. \"Phylogenetics of tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae).\" American Journal of Botany 94(12):2026-2040. ;Species ;names in Poaceae In 1830, RafinesqueRafinesque, Constantine Samuel. 1830. Bulletin Botanique [Geneve] 1: 221 used the name Poranthera to refer to a very different plant than that to which Rudge had already applied the name. Thus he created an illegitimate homonym.
