    "text": "Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n (), was a Palestinian Arab village in the Acre Subdistrict around east of Acre. Until 1949, it was an Arab village built over the ruins of ancient Kefar Hanania. Archaeological surveys indicate Kefar Hanania was founded in the Early Roman period, and was inhabited through the Byzantine period. It was resettled in the Middle Ages and the modern era. Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n was captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war, when many of the villagers fled the fighting. Those few hundred who managed to remain or to return were subsequently transferred out of the village by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to the West Bank or to other Arab towns in the newly established Israel on three separate occasions in January and February 1949. A shrine for the Sheikh Abu Hajar Azraq and the remains of a small domed building are still standing, along with the remains of various burial sites of rabbis. Archaeological remains include cisterns and domestic wells which supplied the village with drinking water from nearby springs. In 1989, the Israeli village of Kfar Hananya was established on Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n land on a hill adjacent to the deserted Arab village. ==History== ===Roman and Byzantine period=== The earliest mentions of the village occur in sources from the Roman and Byzantine periods in Galilee, when it was then a Jewish village known as Kefar Hananya (or Kfar Hanania),Lissovsky (2007), p. 167 that served as a center for pottery production in the Galilee.Crossan, 1999, p. 224.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 279. Archaeological excavations revealed shafts and bases of columns, caves, a pool, and a burial ground. Most of the cooking ware in the Galilee between the 1st century BCE and the beginning of the 5th century CE was produced here.Leibner, 2009, p.130. The foundation of a synagogue carved in the rock and which can still be seen there is thought to be from the 5th-century CE.Lissovsky (2007), pp. 167\u2013168 During the Second Temple period, within a distance of less than a kilometer from Kfar Hananya, was the thriving village of Bersabe (now Khirbet es-Saba [Kh. Abu esh-Sheba\u02bf], Beer Sheba of the Galilee), a village mentioned in the writings of Josephus.M. Aviam & P. Richardson, \"Josephus' Galilee in Archaeological Perspective\", published in: Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: translation and commentary, vol. 9, Leiden; Boston: Brill 2000\u20132008, p. 179 Among the village's most respected personages who is said to have been buried there was a Tanna of the 1st century, Eliezer ben Jacob I.Lissovsky (2007), p. 173 ====Pottery production==== Rabbinic literature mentions Kfar Hanania village in relation to the production of pottery; in the Tosefta (Bava Metzia 6:3), there is a reference to, \"those who make black clay, such as Kefar Hananya and its neighbors.\"Gale, 2005, p. 70. Late Roman-era pottery types of the kind made in Kafr 'Inan have been found all throughout the Galilee and the Golan.David Adan-Bayewitz, Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology, Bar-Ilan University, Question & Response - 2 December 2013 (Hebrew) ===Early Muslim period=== An Aramaic inscription initially dated to the 6th century, and recently redated to Umayyad (661-750) or Abbasid period (750-969 with intermissions after 878), was found on a kelila (a type of hanging lamp) found in the synagogue.Flood, 2001, p. 50. ===Crusader to Mamluk period=== Ya'akov ben Netan'el, who visited the village in the 12th century during the period of Crusader rule, writes about the ruins of a synagogue quarried into the hill. Potential references to the village include a mention of the \"widow of Ben al-'Anani\" in a 12th- century Genizah document and to Kfar Hanan in the 13th century.Leibner, 2009, p. 129 In 1211, Samuel ben Samson travelled from Tiberias and Kfar Hanania before stopping in Safed.Winter and Levanoni, 2004, p. 164. In the 14th century, another traveller transcribes the village's name as Kefar Hanin. ===Ottoman period=== In 1522, Jewish traveler Moses ben Mordecai Bassola found about 30 families of Musta'arabi Jews (Arabic-speaking Jews, as opposed to Spanish Jews) among the residents, most of whom of priestly stock, making it the fifth largest Jewish community in the country at the time, out of the eight places named by him.Braslavsky (1933), p. 20Moshe Hayyim Baruch (1826), pp. 15b-24bBen-Zevi (1943), p. 80Lissovsky (2007), p. 169 An Ottoman census taken two years later (1525) listed 14 Jewish families. It is during the rule of the Ottoman Empire that the form Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n (Kafr 'Anan) first appears. The village is listed in the tax records of either 1549 or 1596, as forming part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira, part of Safad Sanjak, with 21 households and 8 bachelors; an estimated population of 259. All the villagers were Muslim. They paid taxes on goats, beehives and on its press, which was used either for olives or grapes; a total of 12,272 ak\u00e7e. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 178. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as \"K. Hanein\".Karmon, 1960, p. 166 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as being built of stone and having 150-200 Muslim residents. The arable land in the village comprised gardens and olive trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.203, Also cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 A population list from about 1887 showed that Kafr 'Inan had 80 inhabitants; all Muslim.Schumacher, 1888, p. 174 ===British Mandate period=== In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufr Enan had a population of 179; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Acre, p. 36 increasing in the 1931 census to 264, still all Muslims, in a total of 47 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100 In the 1945 statistics, Kafr 'Inan had 360 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 1,740 dunums were used for the cultivation of cereals, 1,195 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards and most of these (1,145 dunums) were planted with olive trees,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 80 while 21 dunams were built-up (urban) area.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 The village houses, made of stone with mud mortar, were bunched close together and separated by semi-circular, narrow alleys. Many new houses were constructed during the last years of Mandatory Palestine. Springs and domestic wells supplied drinking water. Olives and grain were the main crops. Grain was grown in the nearby flat zones and valleys. ===Israeli period=== ====Capture, evacuation and land expropriation==== The village was captured on 30 October 1948 by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Hiram and following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. However, according to Walid Khalidi, the villagers refused to leave like most of the population in the area. Morris reports that the Israeli authorities classified the village as \"abandoned\" but the villagers kept returning.Morris, 2004, pp. 516-17 In January 1949, the IDF expelled 54, and moved another 128 inhabitants from Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya to other villages in Israel.Morris, 2004, p. 517 On 4 February 1949, units of the 79th Battalion surrounded the two villages and expelled 45 people to the West Bank. The 200 villagers who had permits to stay, mostly old men, women and children, were transferred to Majd al Kurum. Yet again, the villagers returned. By mid-February 1949 there were about 100 back in the two villages, according to IDF sources. The two villages were again evacuated by the IDF. The expulsion of the villagers upset some members of Mapam, who condemned David Ben-Gurion and the army. However, a suggestion for a Knesset motion calling for the establishment of an inquiry to probe the expulsions of the villagers of Kafr 'Inan, Farradiyya and Al-Ghabisiyya, was apparently never brought to the Knesset plenum.Morris, 2004, p. 516, note 80, pp. 541-2 In 1950, Article 125 of the Defence regulation of 1945 was invoked in order to confiscate the land belonging to a number of Palestinian Arab villages in Galilee, among them Kafr 'Inan.Nazzal, 1978, p. 100. The other villages were Amqa, Al-Damun, Al-Birwa, Al-Ghabisiyya, Al-Ruways, Mi'ar, Kuwaykat, Al- Mansura, Safad, Kafr Bir'im, al-Majdal, Tiberias and Saffuriyya This law was also used to prevent the villagers from returning to their homes even by legal means.Nazzal, 1978, p. 101 ====Aftermath==== The modern Jewish village of Kfar Hananya was first planned to the south of the depopulated Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n village in 1982, and was eventually established there in 1989 on village land (though not on the actual site of Kafr \u02bfIn\u0101n). Chazon, built in 1969 on the lands of Al-Mansura, Tiberias, and Parod, built in 1949 on the lands of Al-Farradiyya (District of Safad), are both close to the village site, but not on village land. In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi found piles of stones, clusters of cacti, fig trees, the remains of a domed building on a slope facing the village and the small shrine of Shaykh Abu Hajar Azraq on an adjacent hill to the east. The land around the site is forested and planted with fruit trees by the settlement of Parod.\"Khalidi, 1992, p. 21 ==Archaeology== ===Roman to Byzantine-period village=== In 1933, Joseph Braslavsky was the first to identify the quarried synagogue in Kafr 'Inan, based on the testimony of a local Arab peasant.Braslavsky (1933b), pp. 18\u201322; See p. 20 in: (Hebrew)Zvi Ilan (1991), pp. 153\u2013154 In 1989, the site was surveyed by Zvi Ilan. Adan-Bayewitz, of the Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at Bar Ilan University conducted archaeological research at the site from 1987 to 1988, and excavated a late Roman-era pottery kiln in 1992\u20131993, with a stone-paved approach.Leibner, 2009, p. 130Adan-Bayewitz (1992), p. 192 ==See also== * List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus * Palestinian refugee * Present absentee ==Gallery== File:Remains of Synagogue carved from rock, at Old Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpg|Synagogue carved into the rock at ancient Kefar Hananiah (later Kafr 'Inan) File:Synagogue wall carved from rock - at Kafr 'Inan.jpg|Synagogue walls carved into the rock at ancient Kfar Hananya File:Remains of structure at Old Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpg|Ruins of stone structure at ancient Kfar Hananya File:Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan - ancient wall.jpg|Ancient Kfar Hananya (at Kafr 'Inan) File:Field before the Mount of old Kefar Hananiah.jpg|Green fields below hill of Kafr 'Inan File:Ruin of Kefar Hananiah - Kafr 'Inan.jpg|Kafr 'Inan, ruins ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * [reprinted from earlier Livorno edition] () * * * * * * ==External links== *Welcome To Kafr 'Inan *Kafr 'Inan, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 4: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Kufr 3naan from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh *Tour of Kafr \u2018Inan, Saturday, 3.10.2009, by Umar Ighbariyyeh, from Zochrot Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War Category:Talmud places Category:Ancient synagogues in the Land of Israel ",
