    "text": "No Fond Return of Love is a novel by Barbara Pym, first published in 1961.Barbara Pym Society: Bibliography ==Plot summary== The novel concerns the love lives of two academic researchers, Viola Dace and her friend Dulcie Mainwaring, who are both attracted to the same man, Aylwin Forbes. Dulcie is described as \u2018ordinary-looking and unaccompanied\u2019 and consequently no one takes any notice of her, even though some of them had \u2018read and enjoyed her books\u2019. Her fellow guests do not realise that they are being observed. Dulcie and Viola set about discovering more about his background, which entails a trip to his mother's guest house, which has a \u2018bright Christian atmosphere\u2019, in Taviscombe. ==Publication history== No Fond Return of Love was Pym's sixth novel, published by Jonathan Cape in 1961. During the writing period, Pym noted that she wanted to write a novel about \"the lives of ordinary people\" . The novel did not receive much critical notice, although was reviewed positively in Tatler, where the reviewer wrote Holt 1990, p. 183: Pym's working title was A Thankless Task, in reference to the live of an indexer and assistant researcher Binding, Paul. 'Introduction', No Fond Return of Love (London: Virago, 2009), p.xii.. Pym shared the same profession as Viola and Dulcie, having worked at the International African Institute in London since 1946. The publishers felt the title was too negative, and so Pym chose the final title from a poem by eighteenth-century poet Frances Greville (which she altered from \"no kind return of love\") Holt 1990, p. 183. The novel was first published in the United States by E. P. Dutton in 1982. No Fond Return of Love was released as an audiobook in the 1980s by Chivers Press read by Angela Pleasence and again in 2010 read by Maggie Mash. The novel was published in Spain as Amor no correspondido, and in Italy in 1991 as Per guarire un cuore infranto (To heal a broken heart) and again in 2014 as Amori non molto corrisposti (Unrequited love) ==Connections with other novels== Pym's novels usually feature reappearances from characters from her previous novels. Here, the characters of Wilmet and Rodney Forysth, Piers Longridge and his partner Keith, from A Glass of Blessings appear as tourists visiting the castle. Deirdre Swan and Digby Fox, from Less than Angels, also appear briefly. For the first time, Pym inserts herself as a cameo appearance. When Dulcie visits a guest house, she notes one of the novels for guests to read is Some Tame Gazelle, Pym's first published novel. The author would insert herself for a second time in An Unsuitable Attachment. ==Adaptations== The novel was serialised on the BBC radio programme Woman's Hour in 1965 .
