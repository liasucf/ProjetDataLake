    "text": "Twilight of the Idols (In Conspiracy with Satan) is the sixth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth. It was released on 12 August 2003 by Nuclear Blast and reissued in 2006 by Back on Black Records. It was the only album to feature drummer Kvitrafn. This was the first album on which Infernus was not the main songwriter. Instead, the music for this album was composed by bassist King ov Hell and Kvitrafn. The album cover depicted a burning church, but due to the ensuing controversy, some copies of the album featured a picture of the band members instead. == Track listing == ==Personnel== * Gaahl \u2013 vocals * Infernus \u2013 guitar * King ov Hell \u2013 bass * Kvitrafn \u2013 drums ==References== Category:Gorgoroth albums Category:2003 albums ",
