    "text": "The L.A. Black Rice Milling Association Inc. Office is a historic office building at 508 South Monroe Street in DeWitt, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick structure with a low-pitch shed roof. Built in 1942, the building has minimal styling, with a recessed porch on its eastern facade sheltering the entries to two storefronts. It is notable as the only surviving element associated with the business activities of Lester Asher Black (1880-1945), a leading businessman in DeWitt. Black was the president of the First National Bank of DeWitt from its founding in 1912 until his death, and operated a rice mill (no longer standing) as well as a hardware and agricultural supply store catering to rice farmers. He also owned thousands of acres of land planted in rice, at a time when Arkansas was the largest national supplier of the crop. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Arkansas County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1942 Category:Buildings designated early commercial in the National Register of Historic Places Category:1942 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas County, Arkansas ",
