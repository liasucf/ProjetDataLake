    "text": "The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) owns a number of significant artworks in its venue at Burlington House in London. The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society. ==Humphry Davy bust== Humphry Davy bust \u2013 Burlington House The bronze bust of Sir Humphry Davy was created by Ruby Levick and is a reproduction of an earlier sculpture by Miss Moore, donated to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messell in 1900. At the Annual General Meeting of the Chemical Society of 29 March, Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe (President of the Society), reported on the gift of this work: Sir Humphry Davy is best remembered today for his discoveries of several alkali and alkaline earth metals, as well as contributions to the discoveries of the elemental nature of chlorine and iodine. Ruby Levick was a Welsh sculptor and medallist who had many of her works exhibited at the Royal Academy. ==John Dalton bust == John Dalton bust \u2013 Burlington House The bronze bust of John Dalton was also created by Ruby Levick and was donated to the Chemical Society in 1903 by its former President Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe, as also attested by the inscription engraved on the bust's base: \"John Dalton presented by T.E. Thorpe CB. L.L.D. F.R.S. past President in commemoration of the centenary of the enunciation of the atomic theory\". A copy of his accompanying letter was printed in the Proceedings of the Chemical Society in 1903 and read out by President William A. Tilden: John Dalton was an English chemist best known for his development of atomic theory. ==Michael Faraday bust== Michael Faraday bust \u2013 Burlington House A bronze bust representing Michael Faraday, English scientist whose studies greatly contributed to the fields of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. The bust was presented to the Chemical Society by James Emerson Reynolds (1844\u20131920), President of the Chemical Society from 1901 to 1903: ==William Henry Perkin bust== William Henry Perkin bust \u2013 Burlington House The marble bust representing Sir William Henry Perkin was presented to the Chemical Society in 1907 by a committee administering the fund subscribed in support of the international celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Coal Tar Colour Industry. At the Annual General Meeting of the Society, President Raphael Meldola reported on this gift: Perkin's fame is mainly related to his discovery of mauveine. The artist, Frederick William Pomeroy, was a British sculptor mainly prolific in ideal work and portrait busts, but also creator of public monuments. ==Henry Roscoe bust== Henry Roscoe bust \u2013 Burlington House The marble bust representing Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe by Alfred Drury was donated to the Chemical Society Library on 20 November 1913, on the occasion of Roscoe's eightieth birthday by his friends and pupils, as also attested by the inscription on its base: . In 1914 Professor William Perkin Jr., President of the Society, reported on the gift of this artefact: President of the Chemical Society between 1880\u20131882, Roscoe was student as well as friend of the German chemist Robert Bunsen: in their researches laid the foundation of comparative photochemistry. English architectural sculptor, Drury was elected Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1913. He studied at the Oxford National Art Training School and in Paris. ==Justus von Liebig bust== Justus von Liebig bust \u2013 Burlington House The bronze bust representing Baron Justus von Liebig was presented to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messel in 1903: as also confirmed by the inscription on the column supporting the bust: Another inscription, placed between the back and the right side of the bust itself, provides information about its origin: The artefact was created in Munich in 1873 by Michael Wagm\u00fcller, a German sculptor who completed a number of commissions in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy. Von Liebig is considered to have greatly contributed to the fields of agricultural and biological chemistry. He developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts and founded a company which later became Oxo. He is also credited as the inventor of Marmite. ==Augustus Wilhelm von Hofmann bust== Augustus Wilhelm von Hofmann bust \u2013 Burlington House The marble bust representing the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann was introduced to the Chemical Society in 1876 by Mr James Duncan: The inscription at the back certifies that this artwork was created by the German sculptor Johannes Pfuhl in Berlin in 1875. Justus von Liebig's pupil and William Perkin's mentor, von Hofmann widely contributed to the development of the organic chemistry. He was a cofounder of the German Chemical Society and President of the Chemical Society between 1861 and 1863. ==Jean Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Dumas bust== Jean Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Dumas bust \u2013 Burlington House A bronze bust of Jean Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Dumas, the French chemist best known for his works on organic analysis and synthesis, as well as the determination of atomic weights and molecular weights by measuring vapour densities.

Acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2003 from the Chelminski Gallery, this veined white marble bust was originally commissioned in 1731 from the Italian sculptor Giovanni Battista Guelfi (1690\u20131736) by Lord Burlington, a relative of Boyle's, for Burlington House, which was then the earl's residence in London. This work, originally displayed at Lord Burlington's Palladian villa, Chiswick House, is virtually identical to that commissioned by Queen Caroline for her grotto at Richmond in 1732\u20133. The latter survives in the Royal Collection at Kensington Palace and has long been well-known. However, this other version of Guelfi's bust had hitherto been entirely unknown to Boyle scholars. Guelfi was an Italian sculptor who trained with Camillo Rusconi in Rome and was invited by Lord Burlington, in 1714, to move to England, where he restored the Arundel marbles and executed several portrait busts and monuments. ==Joseph Priestley airpump== Priestley airpump \u2013 Burlington House This artefact was created in the 18th Century.

Another inscription confirms that the statue was presented in 1920 by Mrs Bedford McNeill, as stated in the Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemists of Great Britain and Ireland of that year: The full size version of this sculpture by Francis John Williamson is located in Birmingham. It was originally made in marble, then re-cast in bronze and it portrays Dr Priestley absorbed in an experiment which led to his discovery of oxygen. ==Hope: The Chemist== This painting (oil on canvas, 127 cm \u00d7 158 cm), was bought from the Albemarle Gallery by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2008. It is part of Stuart Luke Gatherer's Sins and Virtues collection, which illustrates the seven sins and seven virtues using modern-day professions. It is based on an earlier classic, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768) by Joseph Wright, which was in turn inspired by Robert Boyle's experiment on the properties of air in the mid-17th Century: a bird is deprived of air before a diversified audience and the different reactions of the spectators prove that scientific curiosity overcomes the concern for the living creature. Stuart Luke Gatherer was brought up in the Eastern Highlands of Scotland, he graduated from Edinburgh College of Art in 1995 and exhibited across Scotland, in New York and in London. ==Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat (Requiescat)== A painting (oil on canvas, 20 cm \u00d7 24 cm) by Christine Payne represents the well-known thought experiment Schr\u00f6dinger's cat.
