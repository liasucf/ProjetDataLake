According to tradition Vidyadhiraja want to ordain Rajendra Tirtha, one of his disciples, to succeed him on the pontifical throne. But when Vidyadhiraja fell ill and the time came for formally handing over Matha to Rajendra Tirtha, the latter, who was on tour at the critical juncture. So Vidyadhiraja ordained his disciple Kavindra to succeed him on the pontifical throne. This selection of Kavindra Tirtha as the successor of Vidyadhiraja, leaving Rajendra Tirtha resulted in the bifurcation of the Madhva Mathas, namely Uttaradi Math presided by Kavindra Tirtha and Vyasaraya Math at Sosale headed by Rajendra Tirtha. Kavindra Tirtha was formally crowned as \"Vedanta Samrat\" by his Guru Vidyadhiraja Tirtha in the traditional way. The entire samsthana and all the properties of Uttar\u0101di Matha were publicly handed over to Shri Kavindra Tirtha in a grand ceremony. Sri Uttaradi Matha is the original lineage of the Shri Madhvacharya. ==Works== Vidyadhiraja composed five major works they are: *Ch\u0101ndogy\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\u1e6dik\u0101 *G\u012bt\u0101 Vivruthi, a complete translation and meaning to Gita Bhashya and Gita Tatparya of Madhva. *Vi\u1e63\u1e47usahasran\u0101mavivruthi, a commentary on Vishnu Sahasranama. *Vaky\u0101rtha- candrika, a commentary on Jayatirtha's Ny\u0101ya-sudha. *Visvapadi (also known as Visvapati), a commentary on Narayana Panditacharya's Sri Madhva Vijaya. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Madhva religious leaders Category:Dvaita Category:Uttaradi Math Category:Scholars from Karnataka Category:History of Karnataka Category:14th-century Indian philosophers ",
