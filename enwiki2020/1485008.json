In December 2008, Nogaideli withdrew into opposition, setting up the Movement for a Fair Georgia party.Ex-PM Nogaideli Sets Up Party. \"Civil Georgia\". 3 December 2008 ==Early life and career== Born in Kobuleti, Ajaria, Georgia, Nogaideli graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Physics in 1988. Before entering into national politics, he worked for the Institute of Geography of the Georgian Academy of Sciences between 1988-1992. In 1989-1990, he was also trained at the Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of Estonia. ==Parliament== He started his political career together with his friend, Zurab Zhvania, in the Green Party of Georgia in early 1990s. Nogaideli became a deputy in the Parliament of Georgia in 1992, elected following the overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and chaired the Parliamentary Committee on Environment Protection and Natural Resources during 1992-1995. He was again member of the successor Parliaments in 1995-1999 and 1999\u20132000, when he chaired the Parliamentary Tax and Income Committee. ==Minister of Finance== He joined the government of Eduard Shevardnadze in the capacity of Minister of Finance in May 2000. During these years, he was considered a member of a political team of young reformists headed by Zurab Zhvania and Mikheil Saakashvili and proved to be quite an effective minister. In 2001, he left the President-run Union of Citizens of Georgia party which he had joined in 1995. He was sacked, in 2002, without explanation, though it appears that he had intended to resign in protest against the policies of Shevardnadze's increasingly corrupted government (as the Minister of Justice Mikheil Saakashvili did a year before). In a brief period of 2002-2003, he was involved in banking and investment ventures. After Shevardnadze was ousted in the Rose Revolution of 21\u201323 November 2003, Nogaideli returned to government as the economic adviser to the acting president, Nino Burjanadze. He was re- appointed to his old post as Minister of Finance in February 2004 in the government of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania. ==Prime minister== President Mikhail Saakashvili nominated Nogaideli for the post of Prime Minister on 11 February 2005 following the untimely death of Zhvania. He was confirmed by the Georgian Parliament on 17 February 2005 by a vote of 175 to 24, and was sworn in immediately. Nogaideli is not a member of any party and is regarded as a technocrat with a tough approach to the corruption that plagues Georgia's economy. According to Financial weekly Georgian newspaper The World Bank Group and the U.S. Agency for International Development has honored Zurab Nogaideli, Prime Minister of Georgia, as top business environment reformer of the year 2007. The Prime Minister has led reforms which have catapulted Georgia from a ranking of 112 to 37th place in the World Bank Group's 2007 global rankings on the regulatory ease of doing business. Nogaideli is married with one son. ==Resignation== Nogaideli announced his resignation on 16 November 2007 due to his poor health condition. In April 2007, Nogaideli underwent elective open- heart surgery at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, U.S.RFE/RL Newsline, 07-04-20. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

On 3 December 2008, he set up a new opposition party, the Movement for Fair Georgia.
