The casino features over 900 slot machines, virtual table games, free to enter poker tournaments, and nightly entertainment. ==History== Historic Aerial Photograph of Hollywood Grayhound (Mardi Gras Casino) in 1940 What is now the Big Easy Casino opened as the Hollywood Kennel Club on December 1, 1934, three years after Florida legalized parimutuel betting. A grandstand was added in 1940. In 1974, the facility was reopened as Hollywood Greyhound Track. A November 2004 statewide referendum allowed Broward County voters to decide whether to allow slot machines at parimutuel facilities located in the county. Broward County voters subsequently approved the use of slots at Hollywood Greyhound and other parimutuels. An extensive renovation project in 2006 added approximately 1,100 slot machines and a poker room to the dog track, which was renamed Mardi Gras Casino.http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/mardi-gras-gaming-centre- opens-soon-163243 Two years later, an additional 200 slot machines were added and, in 2009, the Big Easy Poker Room was relocated and expanded. Also included in the renovated facility were a flea market, several restaurants/bars, and a gift shop. In 2015, the casino made further improvements, which included widening the aisles and opening up Louie's Lounge to the entire casino floor. In 2017, the facility was closed for two months because of damage from Hurricane Irma. In 2018, Jeffrey Soffer, owner of the Fontainebleau Hotel, purchased the Mardi Gras Casino from Hartman & Tyner, and renamed it as the Big Easy Casino. ==Casino== The casino offers over 70,000 square feet of gaming space, including over 900 slot machines, virtual roulette and blackjack, as well as The Dog Pound, Mardi Gras\u2019 smoker-friendly slot area; simulcast and greyhound racing. The Big Easy Poker Room, offers over 30 tables of Texas Hold 'em, 7 Card Stud, Omaha and Omaha Hi/Lo. The casino offers low and high limit tables in an effort to accommodate beginner and experienced players. There are also nightly, free to enter poker tournaments that can be entered and tracked through the Bravo Poker Mobile App. == Krewe Club == The Krewe Club is the casino's membership program. Anyone over 21 can become a Krewe Club member, and will receive $25 bonus play when signing up. The Krewe Club is a tiered membership program that includes purple, gold, black, and platinum levels.

Each level gives the card-holder more exclusive benefits, ranging from free valet service to complementary tickets to on-site concerts and events. ==Greyhound Racing== Despite improvements and enhancements over the years, the dog track itself has remained relatively the same.
