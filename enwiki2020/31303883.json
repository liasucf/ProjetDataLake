    "text": "Gibbons Saga is one of the Icelandic chivalric sagas. It is one of a very few sagas to feature a magical flying object\u2014in this case a piece of cloth, amongst many other magical objects. It also features dwarfs and giants.Inna Matyushina, 'Magic Mirrors, Monsters, Maiden-kings (the Fantastic in Riddaras\u00f6gur)', in The Fantastic in Old Norse/Icelandic Literature: Sagas and the British Isles, Preprint Papers of the Thirteenth International Saga Conference, Durham and York, 6\u201312 August 2006, ed. by John McKinnell, David Ashurst, and Donata Kick, 2 vols (Durham: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006). ==Summary== In the summary of Kalinke and Mitchell, > The saga relates the amorous liaisons of Gibbon, son of King Vilhjalmr of > Frakkland. He is first brought under the spell of Greka, daughter of King > Filipus of Grikkland; she is a type of fairy mistress who remains invisible > to him for a long time. After she has finally allowed him tosee her, Gibbon > is transported back to Paris. Reports of the beauty of the maiden king > Florentia, daughter of King Agrippa of Indialand, spur Gibbon to sue for her > love. For her sake he overcomes Eskopart, a rival, in battle. A child named > Eskopart is the result of the union of Gibbon and Florentia. Once more > Gibbon is mysteriously transported to Grikkland to enjoy Greka's love. When > Eskopart reaches maturity and learns of his father's desertion, he vows > vengeance. Father and son are reconciled, however, and Eskopart inherits > Frakkland.Marianne E. Kalinke and P. M.
