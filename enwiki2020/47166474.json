The install capacity of the project is 7.2 MW and the annual generation is 25GWh. The generated energy is fed into the national electric grid of Sri Lanka. == Introduction == The plant uses the water flow of the river \"Denawaka Ganga\", which is a main tributary of river \"Kalu Ganga\". Denawaka Ganga is formed by the confluence of river \"Denawaka Ganga\" (Upper) and river \"Bambarabatu Oya\" at a location known as Mawella. The headwaters of both rivers originate in the Bambarabatuwa forest reserve, a wet zone forest extending over more than 5,000 Hectares. Both rivers flow in a westerly direction south of the Adams Peak hill range, on the south western slopes of Sri Lanka. The catchment basin of the source, especially the Bambarabatu Oya sub-catchment, experiences some of the highest and most consistent rainfall in Sri Lanka. In total, the plant has a catchment area of 172.58km2. The project comprises diversion weir, intake, headrace channel, forebay, penstocks, powerhouse, tailrace, and switchyard. The intake structure is in the right bank of the river and the waterway continues for 1,800 meters in a channel with a box section up to the forebay tank. Then, water is taken through penstocks for a distance of 107 meters to the powerhouse. Since the project is run-of-the-river type, no need of storing of water is required at the weir. The water leaves the generating station and is returned to the river without altering the existing flow or water levels. The electricity is stepped up to 33kV to match the transmission voltage of the local grid. The generated power is then transmitted through a 33kV line to the grid substation. In the hydropower generation process, there are no greenhouse gas emissions and it does not involve burning of fossil fuels during the process. Thus, electricity is generated through sustainable means without causing any negative impact on the environment. Hence, the technology adopted for the project activity is an environmentally safe and sound technology.
