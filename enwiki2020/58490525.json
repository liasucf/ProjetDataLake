Lines are operated through a public-private partnership. In 2016 the Municipality of Pristina purchased 51 new buses for the city, produced by Iveco, in an attempt to modernize the fleet. ==History== Trafiku Urban was established on 1 April 1976 by the Municipality of Pristina as a public company. It was developed in the year of rapid development of the city, when new neighborhoods emerged, and an influx of new residents arrived in the city. The buses from 1976 were present until 1999, when some of the lines were privatized. In 2016 the Municipality of Pristina signed a deal with EBRD to buy new buses for the first time since 1976. As part of the deal, a new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan was commissioned. As of 2018, 51 new buses operate in 15 lines of the urban transport system, with the plan to reorganize into 20 lines by 2019. The current 15 lines of bus transportation in the city carry approximate 21,600,000 travelers per year.Analiza e transportit publik n\u00eb qytetin e Prishtin\u00ebs.
