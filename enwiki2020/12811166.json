    "text": "The Moderates or Moderate Republicans (), pejoratively labeled Opportunist Republicans (), were a French political group active in the late 19th century during the Third French Republic. The leaders of the group included Adolphe Thiers, Jules Ferry, Jules Gr\u00e9vy, Henri Wallon and Ren\u00e9 Waldeck-Rousseau. Although they were considered leftist at the time, the Opportunists progressively evolved into a centre-right, law and order and vaguely anti- labour political party. During their existence, the Moderate Republicans were present in the French Parliament first under the name of Republican Left () and after a fusion with radical republicans as the Democratic Union (). They were further divided into the National Republican Association () and the Liberal Republican Union () in 1888 and 1889, respectively. == History == === Origins === The Moderate Republicans were a large and heterogenous group started after the French Revolution of 1848. However, the group lost the legislative elections of 1849, finishing as the minority group in the National Assembly. After the Louis-Napol\u00e9on's coup d'\u00e9tat in 1851 and the birth of the Second French Empire in 1852, the Republicans took part in the parliamentary opposition along with the monarchists against the Bonapartist majority. === Divisions === President Jules Gr\u00e9vy After the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871) and the consequential fall of the French Empire, the Third French Republic was born. However, its politics was divided in two groups, namely the right-wing monarchists (Orl\u00e9anists and Legitimists) and the left-wing republicans (radicals and moderates). If both republicans were combined by anti-clericalism and social reformism, the radicals were mostly nationalist and anti-German, refusing the Treaty of Versailles with Prussia. The moderates instead supported the Treaty and were more pragmatic on international politics. After the legislative elections of 1871, the republicans inside the Chamber of Deputies split in two groups, namely the moderate Republican Left led by Jules Favre and the radical Republican Union led by L\u00e9on Gambetta. The two parliamentary groups were non-influential during the early years of the Republic, dominated by the monarchist Moral Order coalition of Patrice MacMahon, but after the failure of a return to the monarchy and after the legislative elections of 1876 the moderate and radical republicans gained 193 and 98 seats in the Chamber, respectively. From this time, the republicans maintained strong majorities in the French Parliament and were pejoratively called Opportunists by their detractors for their aptitude to gain the popular consensus in spite of any ideology. === Moving to the right === Prime Minister Jules Ferry, who resigned in 1885 after a political scandal called the Tonkin Affair In January 1879, the republican Jules Gr\u00e9vy was elected as President of the Republic, succeeding the monarchist MacMahon. From this time, with the progressive disappearance of the monarchists the moderates began to move toward the parliamentary centre between the old rights (Bonapartist and reunited monarchists) and the new lefts (radical-socialists, Marxists and Blanquists). To prevent the creation of a socialist state, the two radical and moderate republicans spirits decided to cooperate and form common governments despite the personal antagonism between Gr\u00e9vy and Gambetta, who died in 1882. During the late 1870s and 1880s, the Republican majority launched an education reform with the Bert Law, creating the normal schools; and the Ferry Laws, that secularize public education. However, Gr\u00e9vy also signed the so-called Lois sc\u00e9l\u00e9rates (\"villainous laws\") that restricted the freedom of the press and France started a colonial expansion in Africa, creating protectorates in Madagascar and Tunisia. Despite this semi-authoritarian policies, the republicans refused to be charged with conservatism and continued to proclaim themselves of the left, republicanism in France being historically associated with the left-wing. This paradox was later identified as sinistrisme (\"leftism\"). In the legislative elections of 1885, the republican consolidation was confirmed. Even if popularly won by the Conservative Union of Armand de Mackau, the elections guaranteed a solid republican majority in the Chamber. In fact, until the election the two republican groups had been reunited in a new political party guided by President Gr\u00e9vy and his close ally Jules Ferry, namely the Democratic Union, born of the fusion of the Republican Left and the Republican Union. However, the republican Prime Minister Ferry was forced to resign in 1885 after a political scandal known as the Tonkin Affair and President Gr\u00e9vy also resigned his office in 1887 after a corruption scandal involving his son-in-law. The Moderate Republicans, seriously challenged, survived only thanks to the support of the Radical Republicans of Ren\u00e9 Goblet and worries about the rise of a new political phenomenon called revanchism, the desire for revenge against the German Empire after the defeat of 1871. === Final divisions and decline === The revanchist ideas were strong in the France of the Belle \u00c9poque and with the scandals involving the republican governments there was a rise of the nationalist party led by General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger was Minister of War from 1886 to 1887. His appointment was a strategy of Prime Minister Goblet to pledge the nationalists, but after the fall of his cabinet he was replaced by Maurice Rouvier and the General was not reconfirmed. This political error started the political phase called Boulangisme (1887\u20131891). Around the General was forming a heterogeneous group of supporters, including radical reformers like Georges Clemenceau and Charles de Freycinet; Bonapartists and monarchists who wanted to overthrow the Republic; socialists like \u00c9douard Vaillant, who admired the General's views on workers' rights; and nationalists who desired revenge against Germany. Finally, Boulanger personally led the League of Patriots, a far-right revanchist and militarist league and benefitted from popular and financial support by workers and aristocrats, respectively. In the face of the rise of Boulanger, the republican leaders were divided. From one side, the old republican moderate wing, composed by prominent personalities like Jules Ferry, Maurice Rouvier and Eug\u00e8ne Spuller, representing the middle bourgeoisie, industrialists and scholars, formed the National Republican Association (ANR) in 1888. To the other side, the republican right-wing of Henri Barboux and L\u00e9on Say, who represented the interests of the rich bourgeoisie and Catholics, formed the Liberal Republican Union in 1889. Continuing to depict itself as leftist, the ANR was a conservative group opposing the income tax and strikes that tried to defend the Republic from its reputed enemy Boulanger and used many banquets to finance his activities. Finally, there was a rupture inside the Boulangist party, namely the Radicals of Clemenceau, who disenchanted by the militarism of Boulanger launched the Society of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the socialists became disappointed by Boulanger's frequentation of monarchists like the Duchess of Uz\u00e8s and Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, also themselves disappointed by Boulanger's republican ideas. The coup de gr\u00e2ce to Boulangisme arrived when he was accused of preparing a coup d'\u00e9tat, causing his flight to Bruxelles and a republican landslide in the 1889. In the 1890s, the Opportunist republican parable ended as the Panama scandals of 1892 involved prominent Radical politicians like Clemenceau, Alfred Naquet and L\u00e9on Bourgeois,THE PANAMA SCANDALS; An Exciting Scene in the French Chamber of Deputies. March 30, 1897 granting a large victory to the ANR in the legislative elections the following year. However, the Dreyfus affair broke out in 1893, causing the formation of two factions, namely the Dreyfusards like \u00c9mile Zola, Anatole France and Clemenceau who supported the innocence of the Jewish Colonel and the Anti- Dreyfusard like \u00c9douard Drumont, Jules M\u00e9line and Raymond Poincar\u00e9 who accused Dreyfus of betrayal, partially due to rampant antisemitism. The ANR, which M\u00e9line and Poincar\u00e9 were members of, refused the antisemitic thesis, but took side with the Anti-Dreyfus field.Le Figaro, 27 February 1899 This decision was fatal for the ANR's destiny. In 1899, the re-conviction of the Colonel Dreyfus, with a partial pardon favored by the republican Pierre Waldeck- Rousseau, caused divisions inside the ANR, aggravated by the rehabilitation of Dreyfus in 1900. To remove the mole of antisemitism, Waldeck-Rousseau founded the Democratic Republican Alliance (ADR) in 1901, claiming the heritage of Ferry and Gambetta.Le Figaro, 9 February 1902 Many Moderate Republicans joined the ADR, including Yves Guyot, Ferdinand Dreyfus (not linked with the Colonel), Narcisse Leven and David Raynal. The Moderate Republicans who had remained in the ANR finally adhered along with Progressive Republicans to the Republican Federation, a right-wing party very distant from the original ANR's beliefs. == Prominent members == * \u00c9douard Barbey * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi * Louis Barthou * Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot * Jean Casimir-Perier * Jacques Godefroy Cavaignac * Gustave Denis * Paul Deschanel * Paul Dev\u00e8s * Ferdinand Dreyfus * Jules Armand Dufaure * Armand Falli\u00e8res * Charles Ferry * Jules Ferry * Charles Friedel * Jules Gr\u00e9vy * James de Kerj\u00e9gu * Narcisse Leven * Georges Leygues * \u00c9mile Loubet * Jean Mac\u00e9 * Louis Marchegay * \u00c9mile Maru\u00e9jouls * F\u00e9lix Martin-Feuill\u00e9e * Alfred M\u00e9zi\u00e8res * Victor Milliard * Raymond Poincar\u00e9 * David Raynal * Joseph Reinach * Maurice Rouvier * Jules Siegfried * Eug\u00e8ne Spuller * Ludovic Trarieux * Georges Trouillot * Louis-L\u00e9ger Vauthier * Geoffroy Velten * Ren\u00e9 Waldeck-Rousseau * Henri-Alexandre Wallon == Electoral results == === Presidential elections === {|class=\"wikitable\" !Election year !Candidate !No. of first round votes !% of first round vote !No. of second round votes !% of second round vote !Won/Loss |- !1873 |Jules Gr\u00e9vy |1 |0.3% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Loss |- !1879 |Jules Gr\u00e9vy |563 |84.0% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Won |- !1885 |Jules Gr\u00e9vy |457 |79.4% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Won |- !1887 |Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot |303 |35.7% |616 |75.0% |Won |- !1894 |Jean Casimir-Perier |451 |53.4% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Won |- !1895 |Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau |184 |23.8% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Loss |- !1899 |\u00c9mile Loubet |483 |59.5% |colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"| |Won |} === Legislative elections === {|class=wikitable |- |colspan=6|Chamber of Deputies |- !Election year !No. of overall votes !% of overall vote !No. of overall seats won !+/\u2013 !Leader |- !1871 |Unknown (3rd) |17.5% | |New |Jules Gr\u00e9vy |- !1876 |2,674,540 (1st) |36.2% | | 81 |Jules Dufaure |- !1877 |4,860,481 (1st) |60.0% | | 120 |Jules Dufaure |- !1881 |2,226,247 (2nd) |31.0% | | 145 |Jules Ferry |- !1885 |2,711,890 (1st) |34.2% | | 32 |Jules Ferry |- !1889 |2,974,565 (1st) |37.4% | | 16 |Jean Casimir-Perier |- !1893 |3,608,722 (1st) |48.6% | | 63 |Jean Casimir-Perier |- !1898 |3,518,057 (1st) |43.4% | | 25 |Jules M\u00e9line |- |colspan=6| * * * |} == See also == * France during the 19th century * History of the Left in France * Opportunism * Politics of France == Bibliography == * Abel Bonnard (1936).
