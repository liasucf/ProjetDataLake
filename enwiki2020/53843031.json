    "text": "5 Gold Rings is a British game show that has aired on ITV since 5 March 2017 and is hosted by Phillip Schofield. It is based on the Dutch game show 5 Golden Rings, with the first series being filmed on the same set in the Netherlands and the second and third series at BBC Elstree Centre in London. An app had also been released, so viewers can play along with the show. ==Gameplay== There are two teams made up of two people. There is a giant LED screen in which they must place large, golden rings over where they think the answer is. They will get the question correct if one pixel of the answer is in the ring. If they get a question wrong, they lose the ring and the other team steals the question and try to answer it. With each question, they can win more money, but the rings get smaller. There are two lifelines, Flip the Floor where they can have a different question or they can ask their team of five in the audience to help them. ===Final=== In series 1, the team that took the most money through to the final took control in the final (if they had won the same amount, there was a coin toss to decide who takes control). They must decide if they will answer the final question with a larger ring, or force the other team to answer it with a smaller ring (if they won the same amount, the rings are the same size). If whoever takes on the final get the question correct, they win the money they took through to the final. If they get it incorrect, the other team get their money. ==Transmissions== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! Series !! Start date !! End date !!
