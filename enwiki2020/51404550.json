    "text": "Hold Your Breath is the third studio album by the American Christian metal band, Embodyment. ==Critical reception== Jason Taylor of AllMusic says with Hold Your Breath, Embodyment directs \"their sound toward passionate alternative rock\", and compared to past releases, \"Embodyment targets a much more mainstream version of heavy rock.\" However, he concludes that Hold Your Breath \"is missing that extra something to claim it is an outstanding album\" and \"fails to meet expectations.\" Wookubus of Theprp writes, \"Gone are the screams and grating guitar work and in their place are twisting melodies and emphatic croons, bringing to mind the likes of a tougher version of Far, Jimmy Eat World or recent Cave In with an occasional prog-rock styled excursion.\" He claims \"the material present here is perhaps the band's most mature offering to date.\" Hold Your Breath is \"a worthy purchase for anyone looking for something a bit different from cookie cutter emocore or the mainstream norm.\" Amber Authier or Exclaim! states, \"drummer Mark Garza shines\" but \"vocalist Sean Corbray sounds like he is struggling to perform at the same level as the rest of his band-mates on some tracks\". Mark Broomhead of Cross Rhythms wrote \"Hold Your Breath grabs you immediately as it kicks straight in with a riff slightly reminiscent of The Smashing Pumpkins.\" He compares Embodyment's sound on Hold Your Breath to Kings X's heavier side. Blake Garris of Jesus Freak Hideout expressed Embodyment's \"screaming seems like a thing of the past and melodic hardcore seems like the key to their bright future.\" He calls the lyrics \"repetitive\" but \"very artistic\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Embodyment * Sean Corbay \u2013 Vocals * Andrew Godwin \u2013 Lead Guitars * Derrick \"Stone\" Wadsworth \u2013 Rhythm Guitars * Jason Lindquist \u2013 Bass * Mark Garza \u2013 Drums ;Production * Brandon Ebel \u2013 Executive Producer * Jason Magnusson \u2013 Executive Producer, Producer * Barry Poynter \u2013 Producer ==References== Category:2001 albums Category:Solid State Records albums Category:Embodyment albums ",
