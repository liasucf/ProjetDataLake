The PlayStation 3 also has five games with a perfect score and the Xbox 360 has four, with both consoles having two titles in common. The others are for different platforms with only one title each. Franchises with multiple perfect score winners include The Legend of Zelda with four, Metal Gear with three, followed by Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy with two. , every game but three with a perfect score are either published and/or developed by a Japanese company, nine of them being by Nintendo, five by Square Enix, three by Sega, three by Konami, two by Namco, two by Sony Interactive Entertainment and one by Capcom.
