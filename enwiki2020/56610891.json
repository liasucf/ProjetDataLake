They were Arthur Bauchet, Marie Bochet, Jordan Broisin, Frederic Fran\u00e7ois and Yohann Taberlet. ==Para-Nordic skiing== Benjamin Daviet was at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. He did not win a medal. His best finish was seventh. The first medal he won at a major competition was in 2017 at a race in Finsterau. Thomas Dubois first represented France at racing at the 2017 World Cup in Ukraine. Before that, he was the French junior champion in biathlon and cross-country skiing. He finished second in biathlon and cross-country skiing at the senior French championships. Dubois became blind when he was an 8-year-old because of a genetic disorder. He needs to ski with a guide skier. Unlike other countries, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise handisport does not give money to guide skiers to help blind skiers with the cost of competing. To get the right to go to and practice for the Winter Paralympics, it cost \u20ac21,000. Dubois had to raise money to be able to pay for that. Maubourguet Lions Club helped Dubois get the money for the Winter Paralympics. ==Para-snowboarding== There were three snowboarders from France at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. Snowboarders from France went to Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es at the last part of January 2018 to get ready for the 2018 Winter Paralympics. C\u00e9cile Hernandez was one of the snowboarders from France. She went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. It was the first Paralympics for Montaggioni and Roulet. Hernandez and Roulet have arm disabilities. Montaggioni has a problem with her legs. They were coached by Olivier Noiret and Marcos Lorenzo. ==References== Category:Nations at the 2018 Winter Paralympics 2018 Paralympics ",
