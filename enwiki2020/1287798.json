Accessed June 16, 2011. As of the 2018\u201319 school year, the school had an enrollment of 286 students and 23.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 12.4:1.

Faculty members act as facilitators, assisting students in acquiring the communication and information access skills they will need to function as productive citizens in an increasingly technological world. Students are taught to be prudent risk-takers and creative problem solvers in a global society. Achievement of these goals will result in their becoming socially and ethically responsible adults.\" A broader knowledge base and appreciation developed through exploring the interconnections among science, mathematics and the humanities elicits higher level thinking skills. To foster this development, the High Technology High School will offer opportunities for the students to explore not only these connections, but also a wide range of subjects and interests. ==Academics== High Technology offers a full high school education, with emphasis on math, science, and technology. Students take college courses during their junior and senior years, and seniors are required to take a mentorship course for one semester. Class scheduling works around \"block\" scheduling. All classes are 69 minutes long, and there are 5 periods in a day. All students eat lunch at the same time, between 11:15 and 12:00 PM. Most classes are held three times a week. Physical Education is held two periods per week. AP science classes have \"double labs\" which are two periods (138 minutes) long, while AP Calculus classes meet one extra period per week. The foreign languages taught at High Technology High School are Latin, French, and Spanish. Junior and senior technology electives - Project Lead the Way courses (Digital Electronics, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Biological Engineering & Environmental Sustainability, Computer Science & Software Engineering, and Engineering Design and Development) - are held twice a week for three periods (210 minutes). Both the faculty and the student body have found this schedule to be to their advantage. For students it means more time to get things done in class and more time to do homework. For the teachers it means longer uninterrupted blocks of time to instruct students. High Technology seniors participate in a mentorship one day a week for a full semester. Students work side by side with an engineer, scientist, or researcher, doing real-time research in a technological field. At the conclusion of the mentorship, each student delivers a multimedia presentation in a colloquium of peers and mentors. This summarizes all the formal and informal learning at the conclusion of the senior year. Many of the courses offered at HTHS are taught by teams of teachers with expertise in their respective fields. The sci-tech program, humanities program, and the sophomore technologies program integrate multiple disciplines to enhance subject matter for students. Students work in teams which are assessed by exhibition as well as traditional methods. ==Awards and recognition== *Business Insider ranked High Technology High School at the top of its 2014 list of the \"25 best public high school in the United States\".Stanger, Melissa; and Robinson, Melia. \"The 25 Best Public High Schools In The US\", Business Insider, November 4, 2014.
