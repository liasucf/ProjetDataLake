    "text": "Lieutenant-Colonel William Osborne Smith (1833 - 11 May 1887) served as the first Acting Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, from 25 September to 17 October 1873. Osborne Smith was born to W. H. Smith of Hendreowen (West Glamorgan), Wales. He was commissioned into the British Army's 39th Foot in 1855. He served in the Crimea and came to Canada with his regiment in 1856. He married Janet Colquhoun of Montreal in 1858. When his unit was transferred to Bermuda in 1859, Osborne Smith, then a Lieutenant, sold his commission and became a merchant in Montreal. He later became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Canadian Militia. Osborne Smith carries the distinction of having the only regimental number that carries a fraction. His number was 2.5. He returned to Wales and died in Swansea in 1887. ==External links== * Category:1887 deaths Category:People of the Fenian raids Category:District of Keewatin councillors Category:Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioners Category:39th Regiment of Foot officers Category:Canadian Army officers Category:British Army personnel of the Crimean War Category:1833 births Category:Welsh emigrants to pre- Confederation Canada ",
