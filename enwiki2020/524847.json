    "text": "The voiced velar lateral approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used as a distinct consonant in a very small number of spoken languages in the world. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is (since 1989) and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `L\\`. The velar laterals of the world often involve a prestopped realization . ==Features== Features of the voiced velar lateral approximant: The velar lateral involves no contact of the tip of the tongue with the roof of the mouth: just like for the velar stop , the only contact takes place between the back of the tongue and the velum. This contrasts with the velarized alveolar lateral approximant \u2013 also known as the dark l in English feel \u2013 for which the apex touches the alveolar ridge. ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !
