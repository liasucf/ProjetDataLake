Most p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi place pertinence on language and chanting as part of the p\u0101\u02bbani with the single exception being lele koali (kowali), a Hawaiian Swinging game based around either a koali vine or a koali hao (metal chain). Manaleo \u201cAunty\u201d Alice in her Ka Leo Hawai\u02bbi Interview states that there is an exchange of words and play which span either a few days or a whole week during lele koali.\u201cKa Leo Hawai\u02bbi.\u201d HV24.145B1. University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, April 4, 1976. Interview with Aunty Alice N\u0101makelua. During this time though everybody is convened in an area, having fun, talking story, playing music, and eating together. This page doesn\u2019t seek to compare or contrast p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi with the games of other nations. There is however a Masters Thesis by Yasuko Chiba which features this approach and methodology of comparing and contrasting P\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi Kahiko to Japanese games. == Recent History == === Declination === Early 20th century scholars affiliate the decline of \u201cp\u0101\u02bbani kahiko\u201d, or traditional games to the decline in Hawaiian cultural practice. This isn\u2019t too farfetched, given that there was a synonymity of loss in Hawai\u02bbi related to people passing away at the turn of century. In addition to this problem, there is also the issue of religious difference which occurred between the early 19th and 20th century. Some Hawai\u02bbi were converting over to Christianity and struggled with doing some traditional cultural practices in the face of this new religion. The overthrow of Ka L\u0101hui Hawai\u02bbi K\u016b\u02bboko\u02bba, and the provisional government, which outlawed Hawaiian Language as a medium of education also led to the declination of p\u0101\u02bbani. Many of the p\u0101\u02bbani, which were sometimes embodiments of akua, or elements (gods and goddesses) were relegated to the background. === Resurgences === ==== The first resurgence ==== During the 1950s though one could argue that there was a \u201cresurgence\u201d of p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi. Some argued that this resurgence happened because of a pageantry (play) held by Parks and Recreation of Honolulu in 1921. In this time, President Woodrow Wilson was visiting and saw this pageantry then exclaimed that there should be more investment in P\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi K\u0101hiko. Henceforth, there was a larger investment in this \u201cpageantry\u201d which was enacted competitively at the Kennedy Theatre in the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa. It could be asserted that this resurgence though was only the first of two. ==== The second resurgence ==== The next resurgence occurred during the establishment of \u02bbAha P\u016bnana Leo. The \u02bbAha P\u016bnana Leo, a system of networks based around \u02bb\u014dlelo Hawai\u02bbi, or Hawaiian Language became a charter public school which enabled a space for Hawai\u02bbi practices to be normal again. In many Kaiapuni Schools, at least during the 1990s students committed themselves to playing many p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi. Pala \u02bbIe, a game similar to the kendama, but was \u201ca flexible stick made of braided coconut leaflets with a loop at one end and a tapa ball on a string attached below the loop, the object being to catch the ball in the loop\u201d. Pe\u02bbepe\u02bbe akua, the Hawai\u02bbi equivalent of hide \u2018n\u2019 seek, but was done to a chant for Pele, an akua Hawai\u02bbi. Lono, mauli, pau, the closest relative being Rock, Paper, Scissors, but this p\u0101\u02bbani was meant to memorize a few moon phases. Along with the majority of Makahiki games which took place during \u02bbaha wehena (the opening ceremonies). A category which should have its own section though are the p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi related to Makahiki and therefore related to Lonoikamakahiki. There could even be many different categorizations based on different akua, however, it would be a disservice to attempt to quantify the innumerable amount of akua at play during p\u0101\u02bbani Hawai\u02bbi. Hawai\u02bbi believed there were \u201ckini\u201d akua or more than four hundred thousand akua. == P\u0101\u02bbani Makahiki == Makahiki Games are the most common place today in Hawai\u02bbi, the time for these games to be played is marked by the rising of Makali\u02bbi (Pleiades) during the month of Welehu, a space currently between October and November. \u02bbUlu maika is a game where the contestants bowl a rounded stone between two sticks. Mokomoko also known as ku\u02bbiku\u02bbi, a boxing contest, done with chants specific to place. H\u0101k\u014dk\u014d (wrestling), \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d \u02bbIhe, spear throwing into a banana stump, Honuhonu, hand pulling, Ke\u02bba Pua, dart throwing, (P\u0101) Uma, wrist wrestling, P\u016bhenehene, concealing stones, K\u0101k\u0101l\u0101\u02bbau, spear fencing, Loulou, interlocked finger pulling and Kulakula\u02bbi, a pushing contest. Some mo\u02bbolelo (stories) suggest that mokomoko (boxing) is the opening p\u0101\u02bbani during makahiki and is a clash which requires blood to be drawn. Henceforth, the ceremonies commencing will uphold pono. During p\u0101\u02bbani Makahiki, the p\u0101\u02bbani champion of each ahupua\u02bba tenure system is allowed to traverse with an elite company of champions in a circuit around the island. During this island circuit, the akua p\u0101\u02bbani, an idol related to play, traverses the p\u0101\u02bbani and watches over participants, sometimes they are for one specific person, other times they watch over many. The akua p\u0101\u02bbani is typically held by a court, whom collect the ancestral taxes of each ahupua\u02bba, along side an ali\u02bbi (a chief or chiefess) and a mo\u02bb\u012b (paramount chief or chiefess). This is an exceptional act though; it is not often that maka\u02bbainana or citizens are allowed to interact with their ali\u02bbi in this manner. == Kekahi Le\u02bbale\u02bba == Some p\u0101\u02bbani are for the purpose of le\u02bbale\u02bba and ho\u02bboipoipo. These are perhaps the most intricate of all the games: Kilu is a p\u0101\u02bbani of courting which relies on hula, mele, and is specific for ali\u02bbi which also suggests a need for establishing genealogy. \u02bbUme, is a p\u0101\u02bbani similar to Kilu, however it is for the commoners and was called \u02bbume because the participants would be drawn to each other. P\u016bhene is a game of concealing a rock on the body of a person, the specific instance of Hi\u02bbiaka\u2019s experiences with Kilu, and P\u016bhenehene may reveal to the players the intricacy of language and movement necessary for these p\u0101\u02bbani. == Other P\u0101\u02bbani == Many other P\u0101\u02bbani exist in Hawai\u02bbi and language tends to be the biggest feature. Some games such as ho\u02bbolele k\u012b, are specific to one place (K\u012blauea). Various others take place only in certain regions, such as kaupua, a race done in the ocean, or ke\u02bba pua, which requires a sugar cane stock and sugar cane flower, a dirt mound, and rope to be played. One of the most well known games, k\u014dnane, is a game of wits which requires \u02bbili\u02bbili from the ocean region and p\u014dhaku (rocks) from either the plains or mountain regions. It is possible to read English interpretations of these p\u0101\u02bbani and how to participate in them in books such as Donald D. Kilolani Mitchell's books Resource Units in Hawaiian Culture as well as Hawaiian games for today, and Pukui's Hawaiian Dictionary. == References == Category:Sports in Hawaii Category:Native Hawaiian culture Category:American games ",
