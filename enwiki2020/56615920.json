The Lions were led by fifth-year head coach Paul Westhead. They played their home games at Gersten Pavilion in Los Angeles, California as members of the West Coast Conference.

The Lions defeated New Mexico State 111-92, defending National Champion Michigan 149-115, and Alabama 62-60 before falling 131-101 to UNLV, the eventual National Champions. ==Roster== ==Schedule and results== |- !colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season |- !colspan=12 style=| WCC regular season |- !colspan=12 style=| WCC Tournament |- !colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament Sources ==Rankings== *Final AP and Coaches rankings released prior to NCAA tournament ==Awards== ; All-Americans * Hank Gathers \u2013 Consensus 2nd Team * Bo Kimble \u2013 Consensus 2nd Team ; NCAA Scoring Leader * Bo Kimble \u2013 35.3 PPG ; WCC Player of the Year * Bo Kimble ==Records== ;Season * Points Per Game - 122.4 (3,918 points in 32 games) * Games with at Least 100 Points - 28 * Consecutive Games with at Least 100 Points - 12 ;NCAA Tournament Team * Most points in an NCAA Tournament game - 149 vs. Michigan (March 18, 1990) * Most combined points in an NCAA Tournament game - 264 vs. Michigan (March 18, 1990) * Most 3-point field goals in an NCAA Tournament game - 21 vs. Michigan (March 18, 1990) * Points Per Game - 105.8 (423 points in 4 games) Individual * Most 3-point field goals made (single game) - 11 by Jeff Fryer vs. Michigan (March 18, 1990) * Most 3-point field goals attempted (single game) - 22 by Jeff Fryer vs. Michigan (March 18, 1990) ==Players in the 1990 NBA Draft== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"\" | Round || Pick || Player || NBA Club |- style=\"text-align:center;\" bgcolor=\"\" | 1 || 8 || Bo Kimble || Los Angeles Clippers |} ==References== ==External links== * LMU LIONS 1989-1990 MEN'S BASKETBALL Category:Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball seasons Loyola Marymount Loyola Marymount Loyola Marymount Loyola Marymount Loyola Marymount Loyola Marymount ",
