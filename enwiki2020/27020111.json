    "text": "Christian fascism denotes the intersection between fascism and Christianity and it also encompasses the fascistic, totalitarian, and imperialistic aspects of the Christian church. It is sometimes referred to as \"Christofascism\", a neologism coined by liberation theologist Dorothee S\u00f6lle in 1970. ==Interpretation of S\u00f6lle== Tom Faw Driver, the Paul Tillich Professor Emeritus at Union Theological Seminary, expressed concern \"that the worship of God in Christ not divide Christian from Jew, man from woman, clergy from laity, white from black, or rich from poor\". To him, Christianity is in constant danger of Christofascism, stating that \"[w]e fear christofascism, which we see as the political direction of all attempts to place Christ at the center of social life and history\" and that \"[m]uch of the churches' teaching about Christ has turned into something that is dictatorial in its heart and is preparing society for an American fascism\". Christofascism \"disposed or allowed Christians, to impose themselves not only upon other religions but other cultures, and political parties which do not march under the banner of the final, normative, victorious Christ\" \u2013 as Knitter describes S\u00f6lle's view. George Hunsinger, director of the Centre for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary, regards the conception of Christofascism as being an attack, at a very sophisticated level of theological discourse, on the biblical depiction of Jesus. He equates what is viewed as Christofascism with \"Jesus Christ as depicted in Scripture\" and contrasts it with the \"nonnormative Christology\" that is offered as an alternative by some theologians, which he characterizes as extreme relativism that reduces Jesus Christ to \"an object of mere personal preference and cultural location\" and that he finds difficult to see as not contributing to the same problems encountered by the Christian church in Germany that were noted by theologian Karl Barth. ==Christomonism== Douglas John Hall, Professor of Christian Theology at McGill University, relates S\u00f6lle's concept of Christofascism to Christomonism, that inevitably ends in religious triumphalism and exclusivity, noting S\u00f6lle's observation of American fundamentalist Christianity that Christomonism easily leads to Christofascism, and violence is never far away from militant Christomonism. (Christomonism only accepts one divine person, Jesus Christ, rather than the Trinity.) He states that the over-divinized (\"high\") Christology of Christendom is demonstrated to be wrong by its \"almost unrelieved anti-Judaism\". He suggests that the best way to guard against this is for Christians not to neglect the humanity of Jesus Christ in favour of his divinity, and remind themselves that Jesus was also a Jewish human being. ==Historical examples== * National-Christian Defense League/Iron Guard of Romania * Falange Espanola de las JONS of Spain * Rexist Party of Belgium * Ustase of Croatia * Defenders of the Christian Faith in Kansas, based out of Topeka and Wichita, Kansas, United States * Slovak People's Party (\u013dudaks) of Slovakia * Fatherland Front of Austria * British Union of Fascists of the United Kingdom * Silver Legion of America of the United States * German Christians of Nazi Germany * National Radical Camp of Poland * Lapua Movement/Patriotic People's Movement of Finland ==American history and politics== American historians and political commentators have also used the term to refer to politico-religious tendencies in American society. Chris Hedges and David Neiwert contend that the origins of American Christofascism date back to the Great Depression, when Americans first espoused forms of fascism that were \"explicitly 'Christian' in nature\". Hedges writes that \"fundamentalist preachers such as Gerald B. Winrod and Gerald L. K. Smith fused national and Christian symbols to advocate the country's first crude form of Christo-fascism\". Smith's Christian Nationalist Crusade stated that a \"Christian character is the basis of all real Americanism\". Hedges also believes that William Dudley Pelley was another prominent advocate of Christofascism. By the late 1950s, adherents of these philosophies founded the John Birch Society, whose policy positions and rhetoric have greatly influenced modern dominionists. Likewise, the Posse Comitatus movement was founded by former associates of Pelley and Smith. The 1980s saw the founding of the Council for National Policy and the Moral Majority carry on the tradition, while the patriot and militia movements represented efforts to mainstream the philosophy in the 1990s. Incidents of anti-abortion violence, including the Atlanta and Birmingham bombings which were committed by Eric Rudolph and the assassination of George Tiller at his Wichita, Kansas church in 2009, have also been considered acts which were motivated by Christofascism. The term caused controversy in 2007, when Melissa McEwan, a campaign blogger for then-presidential candidate John Edwards, referred to religious conservatives as \"Christofascists\" on her personal blog. In the 2010s, the movement became linked to objectivism, particularly in the economic sphere, in direct contravention of such Biblical passages as Luke 16:19-31 and (especially) Matthew 25:31-46, prompting allegations of hypocrisy from progressive critics. Ayn Rand's name frequently came up during the 2012 U.S. Presidential election as the inspiration for the economic policies of the Republican Party. ==See also== ==References== Notes Further reading * * * * ==External links== * Category:Christian theology and politics Category:Fascism Category:Christian radicalism ",
