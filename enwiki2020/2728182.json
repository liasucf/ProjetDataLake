    "text": "Waikato Tainui, Waikato or Tainui is a group of M\u0101ori people iwi (tribal confederation) based in Waikato Region, in the western central region of New Zealand's North Island. It is part of the larger Tainui confederation of Polynesian settlers who arrived to New Zealand on the Tainui waka (migration canoe). The tribe is named after the Waikato River, which plays a large part in its history and culture. P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero, the first M\u0101ori king, was a member of the Waikato hapu (sub-tribe) of Ng\u0101ti Mahuta, and his descendants have succeeded him. The king movement is based at Turangawaewae marae (meeting place) in Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia. The Waikato-Tainui iwi comprises 33 hapu (sub-tribes) and 65 marae (family groupings). There are over 52,000 tribal members who affiliate to Waikato-Tainui. Hamilton City is now the tribe's largest population centre, but Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia remains the tribe's historical centre and modern capital. In the 2006 census, 33,429 people in New Zealand indicated they were affiliated with Waikato, including those affiliated with more than one tribe. This is how the iwi describes its origins and tribal area: == Government == Waikato-Tainui's governing parliamentary body is Te Kauhanganui, a governing body of 204 tribal members \u2013 3 members from each of the 68 marae. The marae are spread over a large area from Te Kuiti and Cambridge in the south to Auckland in the north. The executive board is Te Arataura, which has 10 representatives elected from Te Kauhanganui and an 11th member appointed by the M\u0101ori king. The Waikato-Tainui tribal administration (or iwi authority) is the Waikato Raupatu Trustee Company Ltd, which replaced the Tainui M\u0101ori Trust Board, and is situated at Hopuhopu, Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia. The Waikato iwi has been using the name Tainui to describe itself for some time, through the establishment of the Tainui M\u0101ori Trust Board by the Waikato-Maniapoto Maori Claims Settlement Act 1946, with many people now referring to the Waikato iwi as \"Tainui\" or \"Waikato-Tainui\". There have traditionally been strong links between Tainui and the University of Waikato, which has strengths in M\u0101ori language and modern local history. The university also holds documents and objects related to the tribe. ==Hap\u016b and marae== Waikato Tainui is made up of several iwi (tribes) and hap\u016b (sub-tribes). Each tribal group has marae (meeting grounds), which usually includes a wharenui (meeting house). ===Ng\u0101ti Mahuta=== The iwi of Ng\u0101ti Mahuta is associated with 19 marae: * 1 in Mangere: Te
