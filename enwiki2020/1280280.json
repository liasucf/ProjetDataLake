Vytautas copied the Polish system of administrative division in order to centralize and strengthen the government. Trakai Voivodeship replaced the former Duchy of Trakai, which was ruled directly by the Grand Duke or his close relative (brother or son). The Duke of Trakai () was replaced by appointed officials \u2013 voivodes and his deputy castellan. The voivodeship was divided into four powiats: Grodno County, Kaunas, Trakai (ruled directly by the voivode), and Upyt\u0117. The biggest cities in the voivodeship were Kaunas, Grodno and Trakai. The western portion of the voivodeship was split off in 1513 by Sigismund I the Old and transferred to the Polish Crown. It was organized as the Podlaskie Voivodeship. In 1793, the counties of Grodno, Sok\u00f3\u0142ka and Wo\u0142kowysk one of Nowogr\u00f3dek Voivodeship were merged into Grodno Voivodeship. After the Union of Lublin the voivodeship, together with the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth until the partitions of the Commonwealth in 1795. Most of the territory became part of the Russian Empire, while territories west of the Neman River \u2013 part of the Province of East Prussia. ==Voivodes== The Voivode of Trakai (, ) was one of the most important state offices in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They were appointed from prominent magnate families and competed only with voivode of Vilnius and Grand Chancellors for power and prestige. Voivodes were the ex officio members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. Voivodes had their residence in Trakai city, near Galv\u0117 Lake, north of the Trakai Peninsula Castle. ===List of voivodes=== Trakai Voivodeship in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth * Jonas Go\u0161tautas (1440) * Iwaszko Moniwidowicz (1443\u20131458) * Radvila Astikas (1466\u20131477) * Martynas Go\u0161tautas (1480\u20131483) * Jan Zabrzezi\u0144ski (1498\u20131505) * Olbracht Gaszto\u0142d (Albrecht Go\u0161tautas) (1519\u20131522) * Konstanty Ostrogski (1522\u20131530) * Stanis\u0142aw Gaszto\u0142d (Stanislovas Go\u0161tautas) (1542) * Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (1590\u20131604) * Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz (1626\u20131640) * Piotr Pac (X 1640\u2013VII 1642) * Miko\u0142aj Abramowicz (1647\u20131651?) * Marcjan Ogi\u0144ski (since 1670) * Tadeusz Franciszek Ogi\u0144ski (1770\u20131783) * J\u00f3zef Miko\u0142aj Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (since 1788) ==Notes== Category:Voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Former voivodeships of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:1413 establishments in Europe Category:15th-century establishments in Lithuania Category:1795 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ",
