(Article) with ketones to form quinoline derivatives. It is named after German chemist Paul Friedl\u00e4nder (1857\u20131923). The Friedl\u00e4nder synthesis This reaction has been catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, iodine, and Lewis acids. Several reviews have been published. ==Mechanism== Two viable reaction mechanisms exist for this reaction. In the first mechanism 2-amino substituted carbonyl compound 1 and carbonyl compound 2 react in a rate-limiting step to aldol adduct 3. This intermediate loses water in an elimination reaction to unsaturated carbonyl compound 4 and then loses water again in imine formation to quinoline 7. In the second mechanism the first step is Schiff base formation to 5 followed by Aldol reaction to 6 and elimination to 7. :Friedl\u00e4nder synthesis reaction mechanism The Pfitzinger reaction and the Niementowski quinoline synthesis are variations of the Friedl\u00e4nder reaction. ==See also== *Doebner-Miller reaction *Povarov reaction *Skraup reaction ==References== Category:Condensation reactions Category:Quinoline forming reactions Category:Name reactions ",
