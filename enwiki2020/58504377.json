    "text": "The Fitzroy Gasworks was a coal gasification plant in Fitzroy, Victoria. It is notable as the site for the first arc-welded gasholder in the world. ==History== In 1856 the first gas supply had been instigated in Melbourne, Australia, with the construction of the West Melbourne Gasworks. In the same year, residents of the Fitzroy Ward of the Corporation of Melbourne met at Clarke's Hotel, Smith Street, for the purpose of considering on the best means of obtaining a supply of gas within the ward.R Proudley. Circle of Influence: A History of the Gas Industry in Victoria, Hargreen/Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, Melbourne, 1987. p. 40-49. Public concern that the City of Melbourne Gas and Coke Company monopoly resulted in excessive price for gas led to the establishment of several local gas companies, the first of which was the Collingwood, Fitzroy and District Gas and Coke Company formed in 1859. The company supplied gas to an area within a six mile radius of the works, which were erected on Reilly Street (now Alexandra Parade), North Fitzroy in 1861. The original part of the works was on the north side of Alexandra Parade and West of Smith Street, was designed by engineer William Elsdon.Obituary: William Elsdon, 1830\u20131904, Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 125, Issue 1904, pages 427\u20138, Thomas Telford-ICE Virtual Library The works was extended across Gore Street to the west as far as George Street. Opposite the works was the Gasometer Hotel.\u2018Half-Drowned or Half-Baked Essays in the History of North Fitzroy\u2019, proceedings of a seminar at North Fitzroy, 3 December 2017 editor: Miles Lewis, Fitzroy History Society, The company amalgamated with the Melbourne and South Melbourne companies in 1878 to form the Metropolitan Gas Company, and the gasworks were known as the Fitzroy Station. The Fitzroy works was not as profitable as the other Metropolitan company's plants as so gas production was gradually reduced and the site redeveloped to accommodate the company's construction workshops and gas storage. The only riveted gasholder erected by the Metropolitan Gas Company was built at Fitzroy in 1919. The Chief engineer Joseph Newell Reeson undertook a number of experiments with gas manufacture, including the application of electric arc welding to fabrication of large structures, and was responsible for the first arc welded large steel structure in the world, the No 3 gasholder, completed in 1923.The Metrogram: The Staff Journal of the Metropolitan Gas Company, no. 17, December 1939. p. 15. This was dismantled in 1978, and the site covered over, but buried remains may still be present.Melbourne Times. 23 August 1978.
