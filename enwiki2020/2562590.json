    "text": "The Tasmanian Government Railways K class was a class of 0-4-0+0-4-0 Garratt articulated steam locomotives operated by the Tasmanian Government Railways from 1909 \u2013 the first Garratt locomotives built. ==Overview== Side elevation drawing of K class Snowdon Ranger station on the Welsh Highland Railway in October 2007 Although considered the first Garratt locomotives, they did in fact differ in two important details from Herbert Garratt's original concept. First: they are compound locomotives, with two high-pressure cylinders on the rear engine, and a pipe leading to two larger low-pressure cylinders on the front engine; second: both sets of cylinders were placed facing each other inside their engine units, rather than facing out as in all other Garratts. This was a problem on the rare warm days on the West Coast Range in Tasmania, as one pair of cylinders was under the cab, making the cab uncomfortably hot.K1 The World's First Garratt West Highand Railway Society\"Steam Locomotives of the Tasmanian Government Railways and its Constituents\" Australian Railway History issue 917 March 2014 page 19 The North East Dundas Tramway on which they worked traversed some of the most rugged terrain in the world served by a railway at the time. It featured long stretches of 1-in-25 grades, high trestle bridges and 30-metre-radius reverse curves. After the line closed in 1929, the boiler of K1 was sold to a sawmill, and in 1947 K1 was sold to its builder Beyer, Peacock & Co, with the boiler and boiler cradle of K2 attached and repatriated back to England. Beyer, Peacock & Co closed in 1966. K1 was sold to the Ffestiniog Railway for 1500 GBP after an appeal for funds. However, it was too tall and wide for use within the restricted loading gauge, and after ten years of storage at Porthmadog, it was lent to the National Railway Museum (NRM), York where it was cosmetically restored.K1 The Original Garratt - Maintenance & Support West Highland Railway SocietyK1 Back in the UK West Highland Railway Society As the Welsh Highland Railway (WHR) rebuilding project reached fruition, K1's potential for the line was recognised and in 1995 it left the NRM. A new boiler was found to be required. Parts were restored at various locations, with K1 reassembled at Boston Lodge.K1: Rebuilding the Chassis West Highland Railway Society After conversion to oil-firing, it steamed again in 2004 and finally received HM Railway Inspectorate approval in September 2006 to haul trains.K1: Testing & Commissioning West Highland Railway Society A conversion back to coal firing was completed in August 2007 together with some other work which allowed it to appear at the Superpower weekend in early September. It entered regular passenger service in October 2007.K1 in WHR Service West Highland Railway Society In 2014, K1's boiler certificate expired and it was withdrawn for overhaul.K1 Working Parties West Highland Railway Society A full boiler shell exam is required. However, because the locomotive does not meet the operational requirements of the WHR (it cannot haul the passenger loads required) and with the WHR's workshops fully committed to other overhaul projects, in 2019 it moved to the Statfold Barn Railway for a period of ten years. A boiler overhaul was started in January 2020 .K1 Moves to Stalford for Cosmetic Restoration and Display Steam Railway issue 500 December 2019 page 20 == References == ==Further reading== *Belibin, Bruce and McKillop, Bob - K1 steams again Light Railways, Number 193 February 2007 pp. 3\u20137 * * * * * == External links == *Garratt locomotives Rail Tasmania *TGR K class Drawing *Drawing of TGR K class Category:Beyer, Peacock locomotives Category:Compound locomotives Category:Garratt locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1909 Category:Steam locomotives of Tasmania Category:0-4-0+0-4-0 locomotives Category:2 ft gauge locomotives ",
