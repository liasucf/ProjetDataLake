Following a loan spell at \u00d8rn-Horten in 2016 he finally made his first-team debut for Sandefjord in 2017. After the season he was offered a new contract, but left in order to study at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and play for third-tier Kjels\u00e5s. He did not manage to win a cap for Kjels\u00e5s, and after half a year went on to fourth-tier Ullern. He moved home to FK T\u00f8nsberg, before moving up to the third tier again with Flekker\u00f8y. ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:People from N\u00f8tter\u00f8y Category:Norwegian footballers Category:FK \u00d8rn-Horten players Category:Eliteserien players Category:Sandefjord Fotball players Category:Kjels\u00e5s Fotball players Category:Ullern IF players Category:FK T\u00f8nsberg players Category:Flekker\u00f8y IL players Category:Association football defenders Category:Norway youth international footballers ",
