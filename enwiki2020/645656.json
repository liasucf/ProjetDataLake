    "text": "State of Play is a British television drama series, written by Paul Abbott and directed by David Yates, that was first broadcast on BBC One in 2003. The series tells the story of a newspaper's investigation into the death of a political researcher, and centres on the relationship between the leading journalist, Cal McCaffrey, and his old friend, Stephen Collins, who is a Member of Parliament and the murdered woman's employer. The series is primarily set in London and was produced in-house by the BBC in association with the independent production company Endor Productions. The series stars David Morrissey, John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, Polly Walker, Bill Nighy, and James McAvoy in the main roles. The series was Abbott's first attempt to write a political thriller, and he initially made the majority of the plot up as he went along. He was prompted to write the series after BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter asked him whether he would consider writing a piece \"bigger\" than anything he had written so far in his career. The serial was Abbott's third major writing project for the channel, following Clocking Off and Linda Green. The series was also a major turning point in David Yates' directorial career, as he began to direct various high-profile television projects following his work on the series. The six-part series was broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings at 9:00pm from 18 May to 22 June 2003. Episodes two to five were initially premiered on the digital television station BBC Four at 10:00pm on the nights of the preceding episodes' BBC One broadcast; however episode six was held back for a premiere on BBC One, so as not to allow the final twists to be spoiled for those who did not have access to digital television. In 2004, the series ran in the United States on the BBC's BBC America cable channel. In 2005, the series was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide, in a two- disc set. Episode one features an audio commentary from Abbott and Yates, and episode six a commentary from Yates, producer Hilary Bevan-Jones and editor Mark Day. The success of the series and its favourable impression on BBC executives led to Abbott being commissioned to write a sequel, before the first series had even been aired.McLean, Gareth.

In 2006, however, a second series appeared to have been abandoned, with Abbott telling Mark Lawson on BBC Radio 4's Front Row in November that he \"couldn't find a way to make the story work\". ==Synopsis== While investigating the murder of fifteen-year-old teenager Kelvin Stagg in what appears to be a drug-related killing, journalist Cal McCaffrey of The Herald (John Simm) and his colleagues Della Smith (Kelly Macdonald) and Cameron Foster (Bill Nighy) find a connection with the coincidental death of Sonia Baker, a young researcher for MP Stephen Collins (David Morrissey). As their investigation progresses, they uncover not only a connection between the deaths, but a conspiracy with links to oil industry- backed corruption of high-ranking British government ministers. ==Cast== * John Simm as Cal McCaffrey * David Morrissey as Stephen Collins MP * Kelly Macdonald as Della Smith * Bill Nighy as Cameron Foster * James McAvoy as Dan Foster * Polly Walker as Anne Collins * Philip Glenister as DCI William Bell * Marc Warren as Dominic Foy * James Laurenson as George Fergus MP * Benedict Wong as Pete Cheng * Amelia Bullmore as Helen Preger * Deborah Findlay as Greer Thornton * Tom Burke as Syd Hardy * Rebecca Ryan as Karen Collins * Rory McCann as DI Stuart Brown * Michael Feast as Andrew Wilson * Rebekah Staton as Liz Dixon * Johann Myers as Sonny Stagg * Maureen Hibbert as Olicia Stagg * Shauna Macdonald as Sonia Baker * Christopher Simpson as Adam Greene ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:white;\" |- ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| No. ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| Title ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| Written by ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| Ratings (in millions) Sourced by BARB. ! style=\"background-color: #FF623B; color: #ffffff;\"| Original airdate |} ==Reception== Reviewing the first episode for The Guardian newspaper the day after it had aired, Gareth McLean wrote that \"...it's bloody magic. The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott's script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it's time to grow a new finger.\" Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening instalment. In The Times, Paul Hoggart wrote that \"Two excellent performances [from Morrissey and Simm] ensure that the relationship has a turbulent dynamism that is credible and engaging.\"19 May 2003 \"First Night\", MediaGuardian.co.uk, Retrieved on 21 September 2005 James Walton in The Daily Telegraph was more cautious, feeling that the opening episode had been promising but the serial as a whole still had the potential to go wrong. \"At this stage however, the programme is certainly good enough to make me hope not and to ensure that I'll be back next week to find out.\"Ibid. The consensus appeared to be that the serial did maintain its quality to the end. Previewing episode four, Jonathan Wright of The Guide section in The Guardian described it as \"A political conspiracy thriller that's as buttock-clenchingly tense as Edge of Darkness, as cynical about the British political system as House of Cards, and stands comparisons to both.\"Wright, Jonathan. Watch This: State of Play, 9pm, BBC1. \"The Guardian\" (\"The Guide\" section). Saturday 7 June 2003. The television critic of The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe, wrote of the final episode: \"I'm not sure that a thriller can end in anything other than anti- climax. If it has been good you're sad it's over, and if it ends badly you're quite likely to feel that you've been duped. Paul Abbott's State of Play, which has had me swallowing double doses on a Sunday evening whenever the schedules allowed, left us with the first kind of let-down rather than the second.\"Sutcliffe, Thomas. The Weekend's Television: The sticky end of the thriller. \"The Independent\". Monday 23 June 2003. Bill Nighy won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role. The series also won a Peabody Award in 200464th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2005. and won BAFTAs for Best Sound (Fiction/Entertainment) and Best Editing (Fiction/Entertainment). It was nominated, but did not win, in the Best Actor category again, for Morrissey; in the Best Drama Serial category; Best Original Television Music and Best Photography and Lighting. It also won major awards from the Royal Television Society, Banff Television Festival, Broadcasting Press Guild, Cologne Conference, Directors Guild of Great Britain, Edgar Awards, and the Monte Carlo TV Festival.Internet Movie Database awards page for State of Play. Retrieved on 21 September 2005. ==Adaptation== State of Play was adapted into an Americanized feature film that was released in the United States in April 2009. The plot retained substantial similarities to the original six-hour series, retaining the main characters, but with its location changed to Washington, D.C., and with certain aspects condensed and changed in order to fit the two-hour format. The film was directed by Kevin Macdonald from a screenplay written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy, Peter Morgan, and Billy Ray. Ben Affleck, Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams and Helen Mirren appear in the lead roles. In an April 2009 interview to promote the film, Affleck, who plays Congressman Stephen Collins, said he drew on the experiences of Gary Condit, Eliot Spitzer, and John Edwards while preparing for the role. The film was generally well received, but not as lauded as the series. ==References== ===Television=== * Abbott, Paul. The South Bank Show \u2013 Paul Abbott. ITV.
