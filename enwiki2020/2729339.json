Canley Vale was once a woodland area and was originally part of the Male Orphan School Estate. In the 1800s, Sir Henry Parkes (1815\u201396) settled in the district in a mansion which he built near the railway line between Fairfield and Cabramatta. He named it Canley Grange after his birthplace in Warwickshire, England. He named the railway station Canley Moat House and had his own private landing beside the line. \"Vale\" means valley or dale. Cabramatta and Canley Vale were regarded as a single community and from the 1920s it was known as Cabravale. In 1899, the municipality of Cabramatta and Canley Vale, which had been established in 1892, was redivided, and the two separate wards were gazetted on 8 January 1900. In 1948, they became part of the Fairfield local government area.
