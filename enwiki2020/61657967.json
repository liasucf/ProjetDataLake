She came out of retirement from playing to participate in the 1976 Women's World Open snooker championship, having to win through a qualifying competition in Leeds to join the main draw. She produced a surprise result in the first round of the main competition by beating top seed Joyce Gardner 3\u20131 in the first round. She won on the black in the deciding frame against Lettie Haywood in the quarter-final, then produced another surprise by beating Maureen Baynton 3\u20130 in the semi-final. In the final, she lost 0\u20134 to Vera Selby. The first two frames were close, with Selby winning on the pink in the first and on the black in the second. Selby then played consistently, avoiding risks, to take the concluding two frames. ==Titles and achievements== Snooker {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Outcome !! No. !! Year !! Championship !! Opponent !!
