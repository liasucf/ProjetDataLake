He is the author of The New Mutants: Superheroes and the Radical Imagination of American Comics, published in January 2016 by NYU Press, which received the 2012\u20132013 Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies Fellowship Award for Best First Book Manuscript in LGBT Studies. His essays have been published in American Literature, GLQ, Feminist Studies, Callaloo, and ASAP/Journal. == Life and career == Fawaz received his PhD in American Studies at George Washington University. He is a former fellow of the Social Science Research Council and the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, which awarded him the 2012\u20132013 CLAGS Fellowship Award. He is also a co-organizer of the Sexual Politics/Sexual Poetics Collective (SPSP), a group of early queer studies scholars working in new directions of the field. == Work == Fawaz states that his work is influenced by queer theory and LGBTQ writers and artists. He is drawn to the idea of cultural production, including the making of visual and written media (e.g. movies, books, comics), and he often explores this through the lens of marginalized and queer groups. According to Fawaz, having been denied civic engagement in other settings, cultural production has become a way for queer people to engage in social and political discourse. He advocates for the importance of comics in society, as they reflect and explore issues like gender and sexuality before the mainstream culture does. Although comics are often disregarded in popular culture, they are able to address these societal issues in an alternative way while staying under the radar. His first book, The New Mutants: Superheroes and the Radical Imagination of American Comics, explores how the American superhero came to embody the political aspirations of racial, gender, and sexual minorities in the post\u2013World War II period. He argues that the superhero transformed from a symbol of white masculinity in the 1940s and 1950s to a social outcast (often depicted as a mutant) in the early 1960s. This transformation encouraged comic book writers and artists to develop various left-wing political ideals that were not socially acceptable in their work. The powerful mutants and freaks, who were social outcasts, became symbols of social and political aspirations for marginalized groups, including racial and sexual minorities, working-class people, and women in the United States. ==Selected publications== The New Mutants: Superheroes and the Radical Imagination of American Comics (New York: NYU Press, January 2016).
