    "text": "An ethnic flag is a flag that symbolizes a certain ethnic group. Ethnic flags are often introduced to the ethnic community through the respective cultural or political ethnic movements. They are popular among diasporas, ethnic minorities, and some ethnic majorities, especially in multiethnic countries. ==History== Like the concept of a state's national flag itself, that of an \"ethnic flag\" is modern, first arising in the late 19th century; strictly speaking, the national flags of nation states are themselves \"ethnic flags\", and often so used by ethnic minorities in neighbouring states, especially in the context of irredentism (e.g. the flag of the Republic of Albania used as an \"ethnic Albanian flag\" by Kosovar Albanians). Ethnic flags are often used in irredentism, representing the \"national flag\" of a proposed or unrecognized state. The first such flags were designed at the end of the 19th century, such as the Basque flag (1894) or the \"Flag of Zion\" used to symbolize Zionism from 1898, which became the national flag of Israel 50 years later. Most early ethnic flags imply a connection with an unrecognized state claimed by the respective ethnicities, such as the flag of Kurdistan which originates as the flag of the Republic of Ararat (1927). A flag of the Hispanic People was designed in 1932. Alternatively, an \"ethnic flag\" may represent a Pan- nationalism, such as the Pan-Arab flag which originates as the flag of the Arab Revolt during World War I,Ab\u016b Khald\u016bn Sati' al-Husri, The days of Maysal\u016bn: A Page from the Modern History of the Arabs, Sidney Glauser Trans. (Washington D.C.: Middle East Institute, 1966), 46. the proposed flag of Pan- Slavism (1848), Pan-Iranism or Pan-Turkism. The concept of using ethnic flags to symbolize ethnic groups within a multiethnic state, not necessarily connected with irredentism, became popular in the later 20th century, such as the Australian Aboriginal flag (1971), the Assyrian flag (1971),\"The Origins and Description of the Assyrian Flag\" by Homer Ashurian, Assyrian Universal Alliance, 03-1999 the flag of the Romani people (1971), the Berber flag (1970s), the Sami flag (1986) or the M\u0101ori flag (1990). Designing ethnic or tribal flags has become very popular since the 1990s, especially for online use, and mostly do not have any kind of \"official\" status and must be judged based on de facto use. In many cases, the national flag of a sovereign state is often seen and used as a de facto ethnic flag by its people. ==Individual flags== * ** ** ** ** {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !image!!name!!group!!world region!!linguistic phylum!!introduction!!notes |- |||A bandera Corsa||Corsicans||Europe, West||Corsican||1755||From an older tradition, but with uncertain origins, this banner was officially adopted by the Corsican Republic of Pasquale Paoli. |- |60px||M\u00e9tis flag||M\u00e9tis people||America, North||mixed; Michif||1814||Received from Alexander Macdonnell of the North West Company in 1814 and used by the Canadian M\u00e9tis resistance in the Battle of Seven Oaks (1816). |- |60px||Circassian Flag||Circassians||Europe, Caucasus||Northwest Caucasian, Adyghe||1830; 1992||Used by Circassians since the 19th century and Adygea since 1992. |- |60px || Pan-Slavic colours||Slavs||Europe, Eastern||Indo-European, Slavic||1848||Adopted by the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848, used as the ethnic flag of Sorbs, Moravians, and other Slavic-speaking minorities. |- |60px ||Flag of Acadia||Acadians||America, North||Indo-European, Romance, French||1884||Adopted at the Second Acadian National Convention held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island, on 15 August 1884. |- |60px||Ikurri\u00f1a||Basque people||Europe, West||Basque||1895||Designed in 1894 for the province of Biscay, adopted in 1895 by \"Euzkeldun Batzokija\" (predecessor of the Basque Nationalist Party), adopted it as the flag of the Basque Autonomous Region in 1936, prohibited in Franco Spain 1938-1977, official adoption as the flag of the Basque Country in 1978. |- |60px||Bosanski Ljiljan||Bosniaks||Europe, South||Serbo-Croatian||1992||Formerly the national flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1998. |- |60px||Flag of the West Herzegovina Canton||Bosnian CroatsMario Jareb: Hrvatski nacionalni simboli, Alfa, Hrvatski institut za povijest, Zagreb, 2010.||Europe, South||Serbo-Croatian||1992||Formerly the flag of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia from 1992 to 1996. |- |60px||Flag of Zion||Jews||Asia, Western||Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, Hebrew||1898||Introduced as the flag of Zionism at the Second Zionist Congress held in Switzerland in 1898; adopted as the state flag of Israel in 1948. |- |60px||Flag of the Arab Revolt||Arabs||Asia, Western||Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, Arabic||1917||Introduced as the flag of the Arab nationalist revolt against the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Hejaz in 1917.
