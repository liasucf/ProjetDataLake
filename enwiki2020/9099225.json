    "text": "Andrew Jackson High School of Advanced Technology, A Dedicated Magnet School is the oldest fully accredited high school in Duval County, Florida. It is located just north of downtown Jacksonville on Main Street (U.S. Highway 17). It opened in 1927, the same time as Robert E. Lee High School. It was originally an all-white school, but the school became integrated in 1970. It is named for U.S. President Andrew Jackson, an important figure in the history of Florida, after whom the city of Jacksonville is also named. Jackson has the city's oldest athletic rivalry with Robert E. Lee High School. For many years the Jackson-Lee football game was played in the Gator Bowl Stadium on Thanksgiving Day, and it was a major event for students and alumni of both schools. The girls varsity basketball team were 2007 Gateway Conference Champions, beating out Samuel W. Wolfson High School. They won this award three consecutive years. Jackson is the only high school in Duval County with an off-campus football stadium. The stadium is located about three-fourths of a mile north of the campus on Main Street, adjacent to North Shore Elementary School. Prior to the construction of this facility the Tigers played their home football games at the Gator Bowl. When Duval County Schools were first being established, Jackson was on the verge of losing accreditation due to roof leaks, cracks and window damage. These problems were fixed and the school now hosts magnet programs. In 2017 Andrew Jackson High School celebrated its 90th anniversary. ==Academics== Dedicated Magnet students may go into the Cybersecurity program, the Video Game Design program, the Sports Medicine and Biomechanics program, or the Air Force JROTC military magnet program. Students can also earn an Associate of Science degree in Networking Systems, IT Cybersecurity, through a partnership with Florida State College of Jacksonville while attending high school. The school also offers the BCE program which is partnered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida. Junior students are hired to work part-time on campus and have the opportunity to continue that career after graduation. The school currently has a B as of 2017 on the Florida School Accountability Grading Scale. ==Notable alumni== * W.
