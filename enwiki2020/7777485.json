The Ch\u00e2teau du Raincy was constructed between 1643 and 1650 by Jacques Bordier, indendant des finances, on the site of a Benedictine priory on the road from Paris to Meaux, in the present-day commune of Le Raincy in the Seine-Saint-Denis department of France. ==The Ch\u00e2teau== Louis Le Vau was put in charge of the design of the building.Floorplans, which included a chambre \u00e0 l'italienne, are illustrated and discussed in Dietrich Feldmann, \"Das H\u00f4tel de La Vrilli\u00e8re und die R\u00e4ume 'a l'italienne' bei Louis Le Vau\" Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kunstgeschichte 45.4 (1982), pp. 412ff. The gardens are traditionally ascribed to Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre and the interior decoration to Charles Le Brun. This team of masters also worked on the ch\u00e2teaux at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles. Surrounded by five pavilions and a network of dry moats, the ch\u00e2teau du Raincy was at the heart of a private estate imbued with royal magnificence. The monumental stables could accommodate 200 horses. After Bordier added the adjacent territory of the seigneurie of Bondy to it, the park of 240 hectares was one of the most extensive in the vicinity of Paris. Bordier's expenses amounted to the exorbitant sum of 4,500,000 livres, swallowing up his fortune. After Bordier's death in 1660, his son and heir, Hilaire, was constrained to sell the property to Princess Palatine, Anna Maria Gonzaga in 1663. In November 1664 Moli\u00e8re's troupe was commanded to perform at Le Raincy by her son-in-law, the prince de Cond\u00e9.\"Light on Moli\u00e8re in 1664 from Le Second Registre de la Thorilli\u00e8re\" PMLA 53.4 (December 1938:1071f) After her death, in 1684, the estate passed to her daughter, Anne Henriette of Bavaria (1648\u20131723). Ten years later, Anne's husband, prince Henri Jules de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, ceded the property to Louis Sanguin, marquis du Livry, premier ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel du Roi et capitaine des chasses; joining the domain to his of Livry, the house became known as the ch\u00e2teau de Livry. A 17th-century view of the Ch\u00e2teau and gardens, engraved by a member of the Perelle family In 1769, the ch\u00e2teau was purchased by Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, who had both the garden and interiors upgraded. His heir, Philippe-\u00c9galit\u00e9, engaged the Scottish gardener Thomas Blaikie to replace the formal gardens with a more natural landscape, one of the first jardins \u00e0 l'anglaise in France.Patricia Taylor, Thomas Blaikie (1751-1838): The 'Capability' Brown of France 2001. The park was dotted with numerous follies, including an \"old tower\", a \"farm\", a decorative kennel, an hermitage, and the celebrated Maisons Russes, scored to imitate Russian isbas (log houses). One was open to visitors as the \"caff\u00e9 Restorateur du Reinci dans le go\u00fbt Russe\" as a contemporary engraving labels it;Illustrated by Darra Goldstein, \"Russia, Car\u00eame, and the Culinary Arts\" The Slavonic and East European Review 73.4 (October 1995):691-715) fig. 1, p. 701. To add to the ambience of its parc \u00e0 l'anglaise, the waiters spoke English.Goldstein 1995:699. ==Revolution, First Empire== During the French Revolution, the demesne was confiscated by the government and then passed through a succession of owners. Madame R\u00e9camier hosted brilliant f\u00eates at Le Raincy under the Directoire. Neglected and left in a bad state of disrepair since that period, the ch\u00e2teau designed by Le Vau was demolished and replaced by a conventional neoclassical building in the first decade of the 19th century, at the time of Napol\u00e9on I's First Empire, as can be seen in an engraving from 1808.http://www.atlas-patrimoine93.fr/pg- html/bases_doc/inventaire/fiche.php?idfic=062s003. Napoleon I acquired Le Raincy in 1812, but the Prussian army quartered there in 1815. The new ch\u00e2teau fell into neglect and was eventually demolished in 1819. ==Restoration, July Monarchy, Second Empire== During the Restoration (1815\u20131830), Le Raincy reverted to the House of Orl\u00e9ans. During his reign, known as the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848), King Louis Philippe used the grounds for hunting, while his retinue would stay at the Maisons Russes. At the beginning of the Second Empire, by decrees of January 22 and March 27, 1852, the Orl\u00e9ans were dispossessed of their Raincy estate which became a domaine d'\u00c9tat. Houses began to be built in the park and in 1869, they formed the town of Le Raincy. Nowadays, very little subsists of Bordier's estate. The statues of Henri II, Charles IX, Henri III, and Henri IV were transferred to the Louvre; the farm was converted into the Saint-Louis church; only a part of the orangery is still visible. ==References== == External links == This article is based on a translation of the equivalent article of the French Wikipedia on 4 November 2006 Raincy Raincy Category:Houses completed in 1650 Category:1643 establishments in France Category:1819 disestablishments Category:French formal gardens ",
