The song is better known as its 1886 reissue as ''''' (\"Music, the Comforter\"), WAB 81b. == History == Bruckner composed the song on a text of Heinrich von der Mattig on 19 October 1877 in memory of his friend Joseph Seiberl, who died on 10 June 1877. The piece was performed nine days later by the Liedertafel S\u00e4ngerbund in the St. Florian Abbey.C. van Zwol, p. 727 The work, of which the original manuscript is stored in the Library of Congress in Washington,U. Harten, p. 303 was first issued in Band XXIII/2, No. 28a of the '.Gesamtausgabe \u2013 Weltliche Ch\u00f6re === Tr\u00f6sterin Musik === In 1886 Rudolf Weinwurm asked August Seuffert, editor of the Wiener Zeitung, to write another text to fit to Bruckner's Nachruf. Weinwurm performed the revised setting as Tr\u00f6sterin Musik with the Wiener Akademischer Gesangverein in the Musikvereinsaal on 11 April 1886. The original manuscript is lost. A copy of it is stored in the \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek. The revised setting, which was first edited by Viktor Keldorfer (Universal Edition) in 1911,C. van Zwol, p. 727-728U. Harten, p. 452 is put in Band XXIII/2, No. 28b of the '. == Text == Nachruf uses a text by Heinrich von der Mattig. {| | |style=\"padding- left:2em;\"|You joined, hero and master of sounds, This grand cohort of spirits, Who here already ran a higher existence, Because they sensed the spirit of the world of sounds. You have from a chequered chaos of sound Quite often in free organ play Driven artfully the melodies To devout harmonies. Therefore may it roar in the organ's stream And whiz today in stormy chords: You will never be forgotten here on earth: You gave us art, now rest in peace! |} === Tr\u00f6sterin Musik === The second setting as Tr\u00f6sterin Musik uses a text by August Seuffert. {| | |style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|Music! You lovely creation, Full of high power and sweet mildness, We feel double deep your motion, When sorrow has split our hearts. The clouded pressure of the waves of pain It softens by your sounds, Smoothly all the flows travel In the wide sea of harmonies. Like the tone of the organ and the waves of the sea, The consolation draws then into the heart, And calms the wild longings of the soul And loosens the pain in mild tears. |} == Music == The 51-bar long work in C minor is scored for choir and organ. The first 30 bars are sung a cappella. The organ is set fortissimo (in organo pleno with pedal) on bar 31 by the text \"Drum mag's im Orgelstrome brausen\". The song ends a cappella pianissimo on \"nun ruh' in Frieden!\". == Selected discography == In the original setting as Nachruf the organ accompaniment from bar 31 is meaningful because of the profession of the defunct. In the second setting as Tr\u00f6sterin Musik, the organ accompaniment can, as many performers are doing, be removed without harming the sense of the piece. The second strophe, which is a variant of the first is also often omitted.Critical discography of Tr\u00f6sterin Musik === Nachruf === There is only one recording of the original setting as Nachruf: * \u0141ukasz Borowicz, Anton Bruckner: Requiem, RIAS Kammerchor Berlin, Akademie f\u00fcr Alte Musik Berlin \u2013 CD: Accentus ACC30474, 2019 - adapted for SATB mixed choir, followed by Tr\u00f6sterin Musik === Tr\u00f6sterin Musik === The first recording of Tr\u00f6sterin Musik was by Willi Schell with the Cronenberger M\u00e4nnerchor in 1956 \u2013 45 rpm: Tonstudio Wolfgang Jakob (Dortmund) A selection of the about 30 other recordings: * J\u00f6rg-Peter Weigle, M\u00e4nnerchor des Leipziger Rundfunkchores, In einem k\u00fchlen Grunde \u2013 LP: Eterna 7 35 209, 1984; reissued in CD: Delta 18 331 \u2013 a cappella * Robert Shewan, Roberts Wesleyan College Chorale; Thaddeus James Stuart (organ), Choral Works of Anton Bruckner \u2013 CD: Albany TROY 063, 1991 * Michael Gl\u00e4ser, Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Leise T\u00f6ne der Brust \u2013 CD: Oehms Classics OC 589, 1993 \u2013 a cappella * Martin L.
