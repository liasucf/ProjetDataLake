The town's territory includes the communities of Biron, Caps-de- Maria, Carleton, Robitaille, and Saint-Omer. == History == === Tracadigash/Carleton === Carleton, Gasp\u00e9, about 1897 Around 1756, seven families of exiled Acadians arrived in Tracadigash from Bonaventure and Restigouche, following their deportation from Beaubassin, Nova-Scotia, in 1755.1755 documents of the University of Moncton Charles Dugas and Benjamin LeBlanc (both from Grand Pr\u00e9) were the original founders. In 1772, Abb\u00e9 Joseph-Mathurin Bourg, first accredited Acadien priest, arrived from Quebec City. He conducted the very first census of Tragadigash (recensement Tracadigache 1777) where he listed the following family names: Allard, Allain, Arseneau, Aubertin, Barriot, Bergeron, Berthelot, Boudreau, Bujold, Comeau, Cormier, Dugas, Francis, Landry, Leblanc, Poirier, Richard; totalling 177 persons.Recensement, Carleton (anciennement Tracadi\u00e8che), Qu\u00e9bec, 1777 , University of Moncton A, later, three page correspondence to the governor, dated 7 April 1784, stated described land use \"Endorsed: A list of the inhabitants of Tracadigache and the quantity of land each inhabitant has improved\" which averaged 3 to 12 arpents per man. In 1787, American Loyalists found their way to Tracadigash which eventually resulted in the parish changing its name from Saint-Joseph de Tracadi\u00e8che (Tracadi\u00e8che is the French spelling of Tragadigash) to Saint-Joseph de Carleton in honour of General Guy Carleton. On October 4, 2000, the municipalities of Carleton and Saint-Omer were reunited after 100 years of separation and the new town thus formed was called Carleton\u2013Saint-Omer. On May 7, 2005, the name was officially changed to Carleton-sur- Mer.http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/pdf2005/Modif_mai05.pdf === Saint-Omer === Saint-Omer Church After the arrival of the first Acadians in 1756, the territory of Saint-Omer was included in the Parish of Saint Joseph de Tracadi\u00e8che and had a common history with Carleton. As more of the population shifted west, numbers eventually justified creating a new parish, and in 1899, the Parish of Saint-Omer came to be, approved by the government in 1902. For 100 years, Saint-Omer functioned as a distinct parish and municipality. Its economy depended largely on fishing, agriculture and forestry. Saint-Omer had its own elementary schools but its teenagers attended Carleton's \u00c9cole Polyvalente (renamed \u00c9cole Antoine-Bernard in 1983). On October 4, 2000, the municipalities of Saint-Omer and Carleton were united and named Carleton-Saint-Omer. === Saint-Louis de Gonzague, Founded since 1864 === The small agricultural and forestry village of Saint-Louis de Gonzague, 8 kilometers north of Saint-Omer, was established by the Government of Quebec to encourage economic development. The Biron section was shut down by the Quebec government in 1972. Five people remained residents of the village to work the land. In 2002, the Gasp\u00e9 union paysanne held its yearly F\u00eate de l'union paysanne gasp\u00e9sienne there.Radio Canada, F\u00eate de l'union paysanne \u00e0 Saint- Louis de Gonzague | http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/gaspesie- lesiles/nouvelles/200207/26/004-louisgaonzague.asp ==Demographics== Carleton- sur-Mer ===Population=== ===Language=== Mother tongue: * English as first language: 2.3% * French as first language: 96.3% * English and French as first language: 0.2% * Other as first language: 1.1% == Economy == Carleton's economy relied historically mostly on agriculture, fishing and forest products. The deep water wharf allowed for large international vessels to load lumber. Tourism was, from the very beginnings, a significant aspect of the economy due in large part to its beaches and warm water temperature. The Carleton Wind Farm was commissioned in 2008 and is contributing electricity to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's grid. == Culture == * The \u00c9cole Antoine Bernard high school and its students were the subject of the 2014 documentary film, Guidelines. * The bilingual singer/songwriter Kevin Parent went to high school here at \u00c9cole Antoine-Bernard * CHAU-DT == Education == * Commission scolaire Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque (used to be Commission scolaire Tracadi\u00e8che, from the Mi'kma \"Place of many herons\") * Elementary schools: \u00c9cole Bourg, \u00c9cole des Audomarois * High school: \u00c9cole Antoine-Bernard de Carleton * College: Centre d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales de Carleton (Coll\u00e8ge de la Gasp\u00e9sie et des \u00celes) * Continuing education: Groupe Coll\u00e9gia * University: Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski === Historical === * \u00c9cole St-Joseph Grades 1-3 Ceased operation as a primary school in about 2000; demolition planned for 2015. * \u00c9cole Normale Grades 3-4 (building now houses college/university offices) * Kindergarten (1965\u20131978) Now demolished small building located behind \u00c9cole Bourg == Sports == * Figure skating club Les Myriades de Carleton * Nautical Club of Carleton inc. * Mont Carleton snowmobile club * Carleton-sur-mer kayak rentals * 18-hole golf course and golf association * Minor hockey association * Adult softball league * Bowling alley * Health club Carleton-Gest Mag ==See also== * List of cities in Quebec ==References== == Sources == *R\u00e9pertoire des municipalit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec *Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec *Affaires municipales et r\u00e9gions - cartes r\u00e9gionales * MARTIN, Paul-Louis (1944-) ; ROUSSEAU, Gilles *La M\u00e9moire du Qu\u00e9bec en ligne: dictionnaire des noms propres du Qu\u00e9bec == External links == * Carleton-sur-Mer on Info Gasp\u00e9sie * Municipalities and cities of Gasp\u00e9 region Category:Cities and towns in Quebec ",
