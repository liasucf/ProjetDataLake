    "text": "Mark Oliver Everett (born April 10, 1963) is the American lead singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist and sometimes drummer of the rock band Eels. Also known as \"E\", he is known for writing songs tackling subjects such as death, loneliness, divorce, childhood innocence, depression, and unrequited love. ==Biography== Mark Oliver Everett is the son of physicist Hugh Everett III, originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. Everett's maternal grandfather was Harold \"Kid\" Gore, a legendary men's basketball, football and baseball coach at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. When Everett was in his early teens, there was an incident that occurred while he was attending a concert by English rock band The Who, where a laser directly hit Everett's eye. As a result of this incident, he has needed to wear glasses ever since. In 1987, Everett moved from his family home in Virginia and resettled in California. There, Everett began his professional musical career with two major-label albums: A Man Called E and Broken Toy Shop. The pseudonym \"E\" was used for both of these early recordings. He became known as \"E\" because there were several people in his life at the time who had the same first name. While it may have caused some confusion in record stores and radio stations, the single-letter name gave the press a playful handle. This playfulness was evident in a review by the eminent writer Daniel Levitin which began: \"Excellent eponymous effort, energizingly eclectic. Early enthusiasm effectively ensures E's eminence.\" A Billboard magazine review of his second album was similarly positive. In July 2014 Everett was given the Freedom of the City of London, at a ceremony held prior to his concert at the Barbican Centre. Everett has described himself as an agnostic and also explicitly used language about thanking God. ===Everett's family=== Everett's family has been an inspiration to him, e.g. the song \"Things the Grandchildren Should Know\" (he would later publish an autobiography of the same name) and the song \"3 Speed\", referencing the writings of his sister Liz. Everett made a documentary about both his father's theory and his own relationship with his father entitled Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives for the BBC that was aired on the PBS series NOVA in 2008. Everett's father, Hugh, died of heart failure when Everett was 19. Mark was the one to find him. His sister, Elizabeth, died by suicide in 1996, and in 1998 his mother, Nancy Everett n\u00e9e Gore, died of lung cancer. Following these tragedies, Everett and the Eels released Electro-Shock Blues in 1998. His cousin, Jennifer Lewis n\u00e9e Gore, was a flight attendant on the plane that struck The Pentagon during the September 11, 2001 attacks. The plane struck the side of the Pentagon where his father had worked, and Everett remarks in his autobiography that he wonders whether the plane hit his father's old office. In 2000 he married Natalia Kovaleva, a Russian dentist he met near Hamburg, Germany. The marriage ended after five years. Following the EELS' tour accompanying their eleventh studio album, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett, Everett took a break from music. During this period, he met a Scottish woman employed in the film industry, whom he ended up marrying. At the age of 54, Everett became a father for the first time, his then-wife having given birth to their son, Archie McGregor Everett. The couple, however, divorced some time later. ==Career== Everett has used everything from a toy piano in his early \"Symphony for a Toy Piano in G Minor\" to hammers on a radiator as percussion in 1998's \"Cancer for the Cure\". Despite his constant denials, he is suspected of being the man behind MC Honky, who released the album I Am the Messiah in 2003. Everett's music has also been featured on a number of films, including American Beauty (\"Cancer for the Cure\"), Road Trip (\"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\"), Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (\"Christmas is Going to the Dogs\"), Holes (\"Eyes Down,\" \"Mighty Fine Blues\"), Shrek (\"My Beloved Monster\"), Shrek 2 (\"I Need Some Sleep\"), Shrek The Third (\"Royal Pain\" and \"Losing Streak\"), Shrek the Halls (\"The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight\"), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (\"Beautiful Freak\"), Henry Poole is Here (Love of the Loveless), The Big White (Last Stop;This Town) Hot Fuzz (\"Souljacker, pt.1\"), The Big Year (\"I Like Birds\"), as well as most of the music in Yes Man. Additionally, his song Fresh Blood (off Hombre Lobo) forms the music played over the credits of HBO's The Jinx. During 2005, Everett and his ad hoc Eels went on tour promoting his album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. It was during this recording that he worked with long-time hero and influence Tom Waits. In November 2007, Everett published his autobiography, entitled Things the Grandchildren Should Know. The 2007 BBC Scotland / BBC Four television documentary \"Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives\", followed Everett as he talked to physicists and his father's former colleagues about his father's theory. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award on March 19, 2008. The documentary was shown in lieu of a support act during their UK, US, Irish and Australian tours in the spring of 2008. In the U.S., the PBS program Nova broadcast the documentary in October 2008. The seventh Eels studio album\u2014Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire\u2014was released on June 2, 2009. On January 19, 2010, Everett released his eighth Eels album, entitled End Times, which deals with themes of aging and divorce. On August 23, 2010, Eels released a 9th album, 'Tomorrow Morning', which represents the final part of the trilogy begun by 'Hombre Lobo.' Everett plays an acoustic version of the Eels tune \u2018What I Have to Offer\u2019 in a deleted scene from This Is 40,Included in the bonus features on the dvd/Blu-ray release of This Is 40 and follows his performance by telling Rudd's record-executive character that the band has decided to sign a contract with a competing label. On February 4, 2013, the tenth album of Eels, Wonderful, Glorious, was released, followed by The Cautionary Tales Of Mark Oliver Everett, released only a year later on April 21, 2014. On February 19, 2016, Everett appeared as Brian in Series 1 Episode 4 (A Party in the Hills) of Judd Apatow's Love, playing a cover of Paul McCartney's song 'Jet.' He also briefly appeared in Series 1 Episode 9, Series 2 Episode 2 and Series 3 Episode 6. He had a small cameo in Bill & Ted Face the Music. The twelfth Eels album, The Deconstruction, was released on April 6, 2018. Earth to Dora followed in 2020. ==Discography== ==References== ==External links== *Healy, Pat, \"\u2018Nova\u2019 came for his soul: Eels front man on the healing power of a science doc about his dad\", Metro newspaper, October 21, 2008. *FLYP Media, \"Interactive profile on Eels songwriter, about his memoir\", November 25, 2008.
