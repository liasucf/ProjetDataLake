There were reports that the coal they mined in India was inferior to coal imported from Britain and their ventures failed. In 1814, Warren Hastings sent Rupert Jones to survey the area. Having found trace of coal at a place called Jurwah (Jirwaghar), he sank a shaft there and got coal at a depth of 9 feet only. He found the coal fared well in comparison with British coal. He opened a coal mine at Egara and got the coal extracted from a pit (not a quarry). He was probably the first person to introduce Indian coal in the general market, but he failed in mining coal profitably. An agency house, Alexander and Company, became owners of the colliery around 1820. It was the \"first regularly constituted mining company with European capital in Bengal.\" ==Geography== ===Location=== Egara is located at . Jemari (J.K.
