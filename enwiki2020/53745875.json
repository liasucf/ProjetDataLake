In the mid-1950s, Fair started his national service in the British Army when he served in Cyprus during the EOKA guerrilla campaign. He could have avoided service, having previously suffered from tuberculosis and other medical conditions, but saw his enlistment as an opportunity to get away from a claustrophobic home life with his mother and sister where he was the man of the house as a result of his father's death. One of his jobs in the army was to search villages for weapons but he was more often to be found sketching the natives. ==Career== *Vampire Circus (1972) *Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976)An interview with Vic Fair.
