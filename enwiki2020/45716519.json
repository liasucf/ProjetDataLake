    "text": "Dik Manusch (Romani: See the Person, Se m\u00e4nniskan translated to Swedish) was a street newspaper published in northern Sweden. First published in early 2015 and focused on the V\u00e4sterbotten province, the newspaper aimed to help homeless European Union migrants \u2013 who are primarily Romani people from the Balkans, especially Romania \u2013 to support themselves by providing an alternative to begging on the streets. Distributed for free to the migrants, each newspaper was sold for 50 Swedish krona, the profits going entirely to the seller. A second purpose was to create a debate in Swedish society about the conditions faced by these people. Preparations for the newspaper began in 2014, on suggestion from Ilile Dumitru, who had seen Situation Sthlm being sold by the homeless of Stockholm. The newspaper was created by the association SAMS, a coalition of several different organizations and churches in Skellefte\u00e5. The first issue \u2013 numbering 5,000 \u2013 was printed by Norran, and featured content created by various writers on a non-profit basis. It was distributed in Skellefte\u00e5. The second issue, with 15,000 prints, was likewise printed by Norran and financed by volunteer donations. To support the newspaper an association called the Dik Manusch V\u00e4nner (Friends of Dik Manusch in English) was formed. In the beginning of 2017, the editorial staff came to the conclusion that they no longer got enough content sent in to be able to publish an issue. A few months later it was decided to disband the association and to cease publishing the newspaper. In November 2018, former Dik Manusch editor Britt-Inger Lundqvist started the online newspaper DIKKO which claims to be a successor publication to Dik Manusch. ==See also== * Aluma * Begging * Faktum ==References== == External links == * * Dik Manusch in LIBRIS, the national union catalogue for libraries in Sweden Category:Street newspapers Category:Swedish-language newspapers Category:Defunct newspapers published in Sweden Category:Publications established in 2015 Category:Publications disestablished in 2017 Category:2015 establishments in Sweden Category:2017 disestablishments in Sweden ",
