He meets their adopted daughter Marie (Chadwick) and recalls having seen her before in America, where she was billed as \"Mamsie\" in a vaudeville act. That evening Scotland Yard's secret service men raid the Weblings and their daughter, whereupon she confesses that she is an American and is allowed to return to the United States. The Weblings take poison and die before the detectives can prevent it. Mamsie obtains employment in a ship builder's office under Davidge. The secret launching of a ship is innocently disclosed by Mamsie to her brother-in-law, a confessed member of the Industrial Workers of the World, who in turn advises a German spy. The ship is destroyed off Cape Charles by a German U-boat. Mamsie then proposes to run down the criminals and, while employed as a \"passer boy,\" unearths a scheme to blow up the dockyards. She notifies Davidge and he comes to her assistance, throws the criminals into the ocean, and saves the dockyards. ==Cast== * Helene Chadwick as Marie Louise, 'Mamsie' * Rockliffe Fellowes as Davidge * Frank Leigh as Nicky * Clarissa Selwynne as Lady Clifton-Wyatt * Kate Lester as Lady Webling * Herbert Standing as Sir Joseph Webling * Florence Deshon as Polly Widdicombe * T.D.
