Founded in 1583, it was the first Parish Church of Luanda, and was originally made from wooden pillars, plaster and mud, with a thatched roof. In 1653, work began on building a stronger church and it became the Cathedral of the city until 1818, when the made cathedral was moved to Igreja do Convento de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9. From the 1653 building, only the tower remains; the site was transformed in 1881 into the Observat\u00f3rio Meteorol\u00f3gico Jo\u00e3o Capelo. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Luanda Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1583 Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1653 Category:1583 establishments in Africa ",
