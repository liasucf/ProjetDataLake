The station is owned by Covenant Network. ==Programming== WCKW broadcasts a Catholic radio format to the greater New Orleans area, most notably the River Parishes of St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, and St. James. ==History== The station signed on in December 1970 as country music outlet WKQT, the sister station of WCKW-FM. These stations were founded by Sidney Joseph Levet III, a New Orleans native and an electronic engineer. In February 1990, Levet was named Broadcaster of the Year by the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters. (Levet died in 1997.) By 1973, both stations became simulcasts with the AM becoming WCKW on March 2, 1985. After the FM flipped to active rock, the AM was sold in 2000 to River Parishes Radio, who switched it to a gospel format. The station briefly became \"WLTS\" on October 20, 2000, but the station was reassigned the call sign \"WCKW\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on November 24, 2000. Covenant Network purchased the station on January 2, 2007 and began transmitting its Catholic programming. ==References== ==External links== *WCKW-AM Radio Tower toppled (1988) on YouTube WCKW Category:Radio stations established in 1970 Category:Religious radio stations in the United States Category:Catholic radio stations Category:1970 establishments in Louisiana Category:Christian radio stations in Louisiana ",
