At the end of 2009, he lost his full playing rights for the Japan Golf Tour and so decided to play on the developmental Japan Challenge Tour in 2010. He won two events in a row which resulted in him regaining his full playing rights for the second half of the Japan Golf Tour season. He finished second at the 2010 Sun Chlorella Classic. Chand has three wins on the Japan Golf Tour, and two on the Japan Challenge Tour. ==Professional wins (5)== ===Japan Golf Tour wins (3)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|5 Apr 1998 |Descente Classic Munsingwear Cup |\u221217 (71-66-66-68=271) |2 strokes | Carlos Franco, Hidemichi Tanaka |- |align=center|2 |align=right|20 May 2001 |Munsingwear Open KSB Cup (2) |\u221217 (69-68-67-67=271) |2 strokes | Toshimitsu Izawa |- |align=center|3 |align=right|20 Jun 2004 |Mandom Lucido Yomiuri Open |\u221220 (66-68-68-66=268) |4 strokes | Hur Suk-ho |} ===Japan Challenge Tour wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runners-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|28 May 2010 |Fuji Country Kani Club Challenge Cup |\u22128 (68-68=136) |4 strokes | Hiroaki Iijima, Sushi Ishigaki, Hirohito Koizumi, Kiyoshi Maita, Hidezumi Shirakata |- |align=center|2 |align=right|11 Jun 2010 |Tohoku Yakurai Cup |\u22129 (68-65=133) |Playoff | Park Sung-joon, Achi Sato |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font- size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2001 !2002 !2003 !2004 |- |The Open Championship |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |} Note: Chand only played in The Open Championship.
