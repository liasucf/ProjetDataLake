    "text": "Andrew Peter Butler (born 4 November 1983) is an English professional footballer who plays as a central defender for Doncaster Rovers, and also manages women's football team Doncaster Rovers Belles. Born in Doncaster, he has previously played for Scunthorpe United, Walsall, Scunthorpe United, Grimsby Town, Huddersfield Town, Blackpool, and Sheffield United. Butler is also a qualified referee. ==Career== ===Scunthorpe United=== Butler started his career at Scunthorpe United. He made his debut for the Iron, then in the Third Division, on 20 September 2003 as a 34th-minute substitute in a 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road. His full debut came three days later, a 2\u20133 defeat to Burnley at Glanford Park in the third round of the 2003\u201304 League Cup. Midway through the season Butler signed a four-year contract. On 7 February 2004 he scored his first goal in a 2\u20132 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. He made a total of 42 appearances, scoring two goals in the 2003\u201304 season. The following season he scored ten goals in 37 league games as Scunthorpe finished second in League Two and were promoted to League One. His goal tally that season included scoring twice in a 3\u20132 home win over Lincoln City on 21 August 2004 and two goals in a 3\u20131 victory over Rushden & Diamonds at Nene Park on 18 December. He suffered a serious injury in early 2005 before returning to action later in the season. At the end of the season he won four different honours at the club's annual awards. The 2005\u201306 season saw Butler suffer a string of injuries. On 14 January 2006 he was injured in a 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City at Ashton Gate and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Prior to the start of the 2006\u201307 season Butler was injured again, dislocating his shoulder in a pre-season friendly with Leeds United. He was out of action until October 2006 when he joined League Two side Grimsby Town on loan, in order to build up his match fitness. He made five appearances for the Mariners. On his return to Scunthorpe he was unable to break back into the first team until later on in the season as the Iron won promotion to the Championship as League One champions. In the 2007\u201308 season Butler made 36 league appearances, scoring two goals as the Iron finished 23rd in the Championship and were relegated back to League One. In May 2008 he appeared on Soccer AM's Crossbar Challenge on Sky Sports 1 dressed as Wonder Woman. Butler left Scunthorpe in June 2008, turning down a new three-year contract offer, so he could move to a club that would be more suitable for his family needs. In six years with the club, Butler made a total of 153 appearances scoring 13 times, playing for them in all three divisions of The Football League. ===Huddersfield Town=== On 2 July 2008 Butler joined League One club Huddersfield Town on a three-year deal. Along with five other players, he made his Huddersfield debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Stockport County at the Galpharm Stadium on 9 August 2008. His first goal came in a 3\u20132 home win over Crewe Alexandra on 1 November 2008. He made a total of 45 appearances in the 2008\u201309 season, scoring four goals. Butler began the 2009\u201310 season as a first team regular. However, Terriers manager Lee Clark started using Peter Clarke and Nathan Clarke as the club's regular centre back pairing. On 7 January 2010, after not making an appearance for two months, Butler joined Championship side Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. On the move up a division Butler said, \"I'm really happy with the move. It's a weird one because I've gone a step up, but it's something I'm hoping to thrive on. It looks a good club and I'm happy to be here. Hopefully I can play as many games as I can and help this club where it wants to go, which is the Premiership I suppose.\" He made his debut two days later in a 1\u20131 draw with Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium. After helping Blackpool reach the Premier League, Butler returned to the Galpharm, but had the remainder of his contract paid up on 23 June 2010. In October 2010 Butler joined Rochdale on a trial basis but failed to agree a contract. ===Walsall=== On 12 November 2010, Butler joined Football League One side Walsall on a contract until the end of the season. Butler was signed by Chris Hutchings, who was sacked on 4 January 2011\u2014the day after a 4\u20131 defeat to Peterborough United\u2014following a run of poor League form since the beginning of the season, which had seen Walsall sink to the bottom of League One. He was appointed captain after Dean Smith, the club's Head of Youth, took charge of the first team, and scored his first goal for Walsall in a 3\u20133 draw against fellow strugglers Tranmere Rovers on 8 January 2011. An impressive second half of the season earned Butler Walsall's Player of the Season and Players' Player of the Season awards. On 13 May 2011, Butler signed a new two-year contract, keeping him at the club until June 2013. In early May 2014, Butler was offered a new contract with Walsall, however, he rejected new terms with Walsall on 22 May; he made 176 appearances in total for the West Midlands club. ===Sheffield United=== On 5 June 2014, Butler signed a two-year deal with Sheffield United on a free transfer after rejecting the offer of a new deal with Walsall. On 13 August 2014, Butler scored on his d\u00e9but against Mansfield Town in the League Cup. On 11 September 2014, Butler was loaned to former club Walsall on a one-month loan deal after finding first team football hard to come by at United. Butler returned to Sheffield United on 20 October 2014. ===Doncaster Rovers=== On 23 October 2014, Butler went out on loan to home-town club Doncaster Rovers until January 2015. On 6 January 2015, Butler signed permanently for Doncaster Rovers for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a- half-year deal, having made 13 appearances during his loan spell. He went on to play in 222 games and scoring 17 goals for the club. Manager Darren Ferguson made Butler the Club Captain at the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, a position he retained until leaving Doncaster. Butler was one of the four nominees for EFL League One Player of the Month in both January 2015 and December 2017, \"Led the defence by example with a superb goal-line clearance against Oldham and then headed Rovers in front in the same game \u2013 one of two goals he scored in December\". He was named as PFA Player in the Community for the 2016\u201317 season in recognition of his community work in and around his hometown of Doncaster. In 2017, Butler became a member of the management committee of the PFA. He was offered a new contract, a one-year deal including coaching, by Doncaster at the end of the 2018\u201319 season however this was on greatly reduced terms by then manager Grant McCann. ===Scunthorpe United=== He decided to make a return to Scunthorpe United. ===Doncaster Rovers=== On 11 September 2020 he was signed by Rovers on a contract until January 2021. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Scunthorpe United |2003\u201304 |Third Division |34||2||4||0||1||0||3Appearance(s) in Football League Trophy||0||42||2 |- |2004\u201305 |League Two |37||10||3||0||1||0||0||0||41||10 |- |2005\u201306 |League One |16||1||3||0||1||0||2||0||22||1 |- |2006\u201307 |League One |11||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |2007\u201308 |Championship |36||2||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||2 |- !colspan=2|Total !134!!15!!10!!0!!4!!0!!5!!0!!153!!15 |- |Grimsby Town (loan) |2006\u201307 |League Two |4||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||5||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Huddersfield Town |2008\u201309 |League One |42||4||1||0||1||0||1||0||45||4 |- |2009\u201310 |League One |11||0||0||0||1||0||1||0||13||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !53!!4!!1!!0!!2!!0!!2!!0!!58!!4 |- |Blackpool (loan) |2009\u201310 |Championship |7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Walsall |2010\u201311 |League One |31||4||1||0||0||0||0||0||32||4 |- |2011\u201312 |League One |42||5||3||0||1||0||2||0||48||5 |- |2012\u201313 |League One |41||3||2||0||2||0||1||0||46||3 |- |2013\u201314 |League One |45||2||2||0||2||0||1||0||50||2 |- !colspan=2|Total !159!!14!!8!!0!!5!!0!!4!!0!!176!!14 |- |Sheffield United |2014\u201315 |League One |0||0||0||0||1||1||0||0||1||1 |- |Walsall (loan) |2014\u201315 |League One |7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0 |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Doncaster Rovers |rowspan=\"2\"|2014\u201315Butler made 13 appearances on loan for the club before joining permanently on 6 January 2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|League One |9||1||3||0||0||0||1||0||13||1 |- |24||2||1||0||0||0||0||0||25||2 |- |2015\u201316 |League One |40||4||3||0||2||0||2||0||47||4 |- |2016\u201317 |League Two |44||3||1||0||1||0||0||0||46||3 |- |2017\u201318 |League One |36||4||3||0||2||0||2||0||43||4 |- |2018\u201319 |League One |40||1||4||1||1||0||31 Appearance in Football League Trophy and 2 in League One Play-offs||1Goal in League One Play-offs||48||3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Doncaster total !193!!15!!15!!1!!6!!0!!8!!1!!222!!17 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Scunthorpe United |rowspan=\"1\"|2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|League Two |11||0||1||0||1||0||1||0||14||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !568!!48!!35!!1!!19!!1!!21!!1!!643!!51 |} ==Honours== ;Scunthorpe United: *League One champion: 2006\u201307 ==References== ==External links== * Andy Butler player profile at htafc.com * Andy Butler player profile at scunthorpe-united.co.uk * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Doncaster Category:English footballers Category:Association football central defenders Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English women's football managers Category:Doncaster Rovers Belles L.F.C. managers ",
