It serves the town of Yarragon, and opened on 1 August 1878.Yarragon Vicsig A disused goods platform exists behind Platform 2, by 2019 it was partly demolished and the rail was removed. Steam locomotive K162 is on display opposite the Platform 1 entrance. This locomotive was exchanged for K183 of the same class, when Steamrail Victoria deemed the latter to be in better condition. K183's tender remained, and thus K162 was painted as K183. During August 1988, the double line block system between Yarragon and Warragul was abolished, with automatic three position signalling introduced. Switching out facilities were also provided at Yarragon during this time. ==Platforms & services== Yarragon has two side platforms.
