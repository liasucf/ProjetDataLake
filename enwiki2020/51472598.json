It is contested by a record number of 142 teams representing 138 nations. Azerbaijan, as host nation, field three teams, whilst the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA) and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provide one team. A total number of 693 players are participating in the women's event. China won the gold medal in the women's event, their first since 1994 and their fifth overall. Russian Valentina Gunina, playing on board two, was the best individual player in the women's event with 8 out of 10 points (seven wins, two draws and one loss) with a rating performance of 2643. The gold medals on the other boards were won by Anna Muzychuk of Ukraine on board one, Gulnar Mammadova of Azerbaijan on board three, Tan Zhongyi of China on board four, and Guo Qi of China as a reserve player. == Competition format and calendar == The tournament was played in a Swiss system format. The time control for all games was 90 minutes per 40 moves with additional 30 minutes after the 40th move, while the increment was 30 seconds per move. It was allowed for a player to offer a draw at any time during the game. A total of 11 rounds were played, in which every team played with four of their players against another team. Every team were allowed to nominate one reserve player. Teams are ranked according to the match points won in every round. In case of same number of match points by two or more teams, the tie-breaker was decided by applying: 1. The Sonneborn-Berger system; 2. Total game points scored; 3. Sum of the match points of the opponents, excluding the lowest one. The opening ceremony of the Chess Olympiad took place at 18:30 AZST (UTC+5) on 1 September and the closing ceremony took place at 19:30 AZST (UTC+5) on 13 September. Tournament rounds started on 2 September and will end with the final round on 13 September. All rounds start at 15:00 AZST (UTC+5), except for the final round which will start at 11:00 AZST (UTC+5). There was one rest day at the tournament, on 7 September after the fifth round.

The current Women's World Champion and highest rated woman Hou Yifan was playing on board one for China, while former Women's World Champions Antoaneta Stefanova, Alexandra Kosteniuk, Anna Ushenina and Mariya Muzychuk were also part of their national teams. The top seed in the women's event were China with an average rating of 2528. They were led by the Women's World Champion Hou Yifan on board one, along with Zhao Xue, Ju Wenjun, Tan Zhongyi and Guo Qi. The reigning champions Russia have the second highest average rating. They were led by Alexandra Kosteniuk and were playing with the same players as in the previous Olympiad, where the only difference was the induction of Aleksandra Goryachkina instead of the absent Kateryna Lagno. Ukraine and Georgia were the other two teams with average rating higher than 2400. The Ukrainian team consisted of most Grandmasters (four) and Women's World Champions (two), and included both Anna and Mariya Muzychuk playing on the top two boards, Anna Ushenina, Natalia Zhukova and Inna Gaponenko. Georgia were led by the best individual player in the women's event of the Chess Olympiad in Troms\u00f8 in 2014 Nana Dzagnidze, and also had Lela Javakhishvili, Nino Batsiashvili, Bela Khotenashvili and Salome Melia on the team.

Top five seeded teams, China, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and India swept Luxembourg, Portugal, Scotland, the ICCD and Macedonia, respectively. All three teams of the host-nation Azerbaijan also had perfect scores as Azerbaijan-1 and Azerbaijan-2 defeated Nicaragua and Japan, respectively, while Azerbaijan-3 won their match again Lesotho without playing, because Lesothan players had not arrived yet. The only close match was Greece's win against Sri Lanka 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. Three of the world's top four players, Hou Yifan, Anna Muzychuk and Harika Dronavalli, did not play in the first round. Natalia Zhukova and Inna Gaponenko from Ukraine, playing with the White pieces on boards 2 and 4, respectively, won nicely with sacrificial combinations targeting the square g7 in Ukraine's whitewash of Portugal. === Round 2 === The number of teams continuing their winning streak from the first round reduced to 20 with only five, China, Russia, Lithuania, Italy and France, scoring 8 of 8. China and Russia recorded another clear sweeps against Montenegro and Ecuador, respectively, while Ukraine were cut off half point by Moldova after Anna Muzychuk drew her game with the White pieces against Diana Baciu on board one. United States beat Norway by a minimal margin in an interesting match with three draws and American Women's Champion Naz\u00ed Paikidze scoring the only win with a spirited attack as Black. Bulgaria's Antoaneta Stefanova won her game with the Black pieces against Oksana Vovk on board one, yet her team played 2\u20132 with Denmark, because Iva Videnova and Adriana Nikolova lost their games on the next two boards. Spain were also surprisingly held to a 2\u20132 tie against Estonia. The biggest upset of the day, however, was Georgia's loss to the 46th seeds the Philippines 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. Nino Batsiashvili beat Christy Lamiel Bernales as White on board three and Nana Dzagnidze drew Janelle Mae Frayna on board one. The disappointment for the Georgian team came from boards 2 and 4. Bela Khotenashvili brought the game against Jan Jodilyn Fronda to a positionally won rook endgame but then she threw it away to a drawn endgame before making a blunder on move 31 that costed her the game (see diagram). Fronda's win was her first against a grandmaster in her life. She said she had not expected her preparation would come in the game and added that had not expected to beat a grandmaster. The match was tied with only game ongoing, the one between Catherine Secopito and Salome Melia. Secopito was offered a draw in a position with winning advantage that would have led the match to end in a tie. Then, she asked her coach how a draw would impact the team, which is allowed by the rules at the Olympiads, and he encouraged her by saying to \"just play\". She later managed to convert her advantage to a full point to secure the win for her team. After the round, Philippine team captain Jayson Gonzales said that the team lack exposure and that their rating is relative of their strength. He added that their rating is plus 300 from the published number and that they had shown they could compete. Harika Dronavalli was the last still playing her game for India, who had already secured the win against Brazil with three wins on the boards 2\u20134. Nevertheless, it seemed like she forgot about the clock and lost on time in an endgame with better position to Brazil's Juliana Terao. === Round 3 === The matches of round three saw Russia and Ukraine continuing their winning streak, while China were halted to a 2\u20132 tie by Vietnam. France did also proceed on the winning run with a third consecutive match win for a remarkable 11\u00bd out of 12 board points. The number of teams winning their first three matches fell down to 13. Russia defeated Uzbekistan 3-1 thanks to the wins on the first two boards by Alexandra Kosteniuk as White against Nafisa Muminova and Valentina Gunina as Black against Gulrukhbegim Tokhirjonova. Ukraine had a more serious opponent in the United States and entered the match with the strongest line-up. The games on the first three boards between Irina Krush and Mariya Muzychuk, Naz\u00ed Paikidze and Anna Muzychuk, and Anna Zatonskih and Natalia Zhukova were all drawn; the only decisive game appeared on board four, where Anna Ushenina beat Kate\u0159ina N\u011bmcov\u00e1 to give Ukraine a narrow win by 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. Hou Yifan played her first game at the Olympiad and won against Vietnamese Ph\u1ea1m L\u00ea Th\u1ea3o Nguy\u00ean. Her win, however, was not enough for China to snatch the match win as Zhao Xue suffered a loss with the White pieces from Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Mai H\u01b0ng on the third board and the other two games were drawn. Georgia recovered from the shocking loss to the Philippines in the previous round to convincingly beat Estonia 3\u00bd-\u00bd, in a match with only Lela Javakhishvili failing to win her game against Monika Ts\u00f5ganova. The Philippines were out of the form against Georgia and were doused by the strong Indian team with 3\u00bd-\u00bd, though Janelle May Frayna showed consistency and held a drew to Harika Dronavalli. Besides the tie of the Chinese team, surprising results occurred in some other matches. One of the biggest upsets of the day was Bulgaria, who were beaten by lower-rated Kazakhstan. The victory of the Kazakh team was supported by Zhansaya Abdumalik's win over the former Women's World Champion Antoaneta Stefanova with a powerful long-term sacrifice (see diagram). The strongest of the Azerbaijani teams edged out the higher-rated Polish team 2\u00bd-1\u00bd after Zeinab Mamedyarova beat Monika So\u0107ko with the Black pieces on the top board and Gunay Mammadzada defeated Jolanta Zawadzka on the second board. Azerbaijan-2 also remained unbeaten against a higher-rated team as they held Germany to a 2\u20132 tie. Another surprising result was also Iceland's minimal win over England, in which the Icelandic players were efficient with the White pieces as Lenka Pt\u00e1\u010dn\u00edkov\u00e1 and Hallger\u00f0ur \u00deorsteinsd\u00f3ttir beat Jovanka Houska and Sarah Longson, respectively. === Round 4 === The pairings in the fourth round resulted in interesting matches involving strong teams. Ukraine, Serbia, Russia and Kazakhstan remained the only teams with four match victories. Russia narrowly beat Hungary on the top match board with draws on the first three boards and a single win by Natalija Pogonina over Anita Gara. The game on the first board between Hoang Thanh Trang and Alexandra Kosteniuk may have directly affected the match outcome but the Russian closely escaped from an inferior position with a pawn down in the endgame. On the second match board, Ukraine faced France, who had arrived at the Chess Olympiad without their top two players Marie Sebag and Almira Skripchenko. The French team was additionally weakened for the match, because their highest rated player in the tournament Sophie Milliet was given a day off. Under these circumstances, the Ukrainian team snatched a convincing 3\u00bd-\u00bd victory with wins by the Muzychuk sisters and Natalia Zhukova on the first three boards. Serbia and Kazakhstan started the tournament as 27th and 31st seeds, respectively but continued their perfect match score in the fourth round to join Ukraine and Russia on the top. Serbia's Jovana Rapport lost to Pia Cramling on board one but her teammates dominated on the other boards to give her team a 3\u20131 win against Sweden. Kazakhstan closely won the clash with Lithuania 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. Following the surprising tie with Vietnam in the previous round, the Chinese team bounced back with a minimal win against Latvia thanks to the wins with the White pieces by Ju Wenjun against Laura Rogule and Guo Qi against Elina Otikova. However, the biggest attention in the match and perhaps the whole day overall was attached to the first board, where the current Minister of Finance of Latvia Dana Reizniece-Ozola outplayed the current Women's World Champion Hou Yifan. The World champion was out of inertia and committed herself to mistakes that brought her to a hopeless position, leaving the opponent with a kingside attack that could have not been stopped (see diagram). Prior to the Olympiad, the Latvian modestly commented in an interview about their chances: > What can we expect from it? They say that you have to shoot for the stars to > get to the moon. However, an objective assessment of the situation is that > we\u2019re not ready to win medals, but we\u2019ll work with a common goal \u2013 to > represent Latvia strongly, sincerely and vigorously. Remember a rule that > doesn\u2019t disappoint: If you\u2019ve done everything in your power, you also > deserve good fortune. In the other matches contested by teams who had perfect match scores in the first three rounds, India unexpectedly drew with Israel as well as Azerbaijan-1 with Romania, leaving all four teams unbeaten after four rounds. === Round 5 === The top two match boards in round five featured the four teams with a perfect score after the first four rounds playing among themselves. Ukraine beat Serbia 3-1 thanks to the wins by the Muzychuk sisters on the first two boards. Yet, they both had worse positions at some point during their games but managed to consolidate and even win. Anna Muzychuk had an inferior position with the Black pieces against Jovana Rapport until the Serbian decided to push the h-pawn and eventually got a position with a piece up for two pawns. Shortly after, Rapport played a blunder, which allowed Muzychuk to play a combination with a queen sacrifice that left her with a winning advantage. Mariya Muzychuk had a worse position throughout most of the game with the White pieces against Irina Chelushkina and even went into the endgame with an exchange down but managed to win the endgame after Chelushkina played some imprecise moves. Russia scored a convincing victory against Kazakhstan 3\u00bd-\u00bd. Alexandra Kosteniuk opened the scoring with a 30-move win as White against the 16-year old Zhansaya Abdumalik, who blundered a piece on move 29 and resigned after the opponent's next move. Valentina Gunina and Olga Girya completed the job adding two wins as Black. Women's World Champion Hou Yifan scored a nice win over Olga Zimina after sacrificing two minor pieces for a strong attack against the uncastled Black king. Tan Zhongyi did also win her game as White against Daniela Movileanu to secure a 3\u20131 win for her team against Italy. Lithuania, who had arrived in Baku without their highest rated player Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117, faced the United States. Deimant\u0117 Daulyt\u0117 beat Irina Krush with the Black pieces on board one in a flourishing game with a rook sacrifice that helped her cut off the opponent's king and prepare her pieces for the winning attack (see diagram). Nevertheless, the American players scored two wins on the bottom boards, where Anna Zatonskih and Sabina- Francesca Foisor defeated Daiva Batyte and Laima Domarkait\u0117, respectively, and subsequently edged out Lithuania 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. Azeribaijan-1 scored an important victory of 3\u20131 against higher-rated Germany as a result of two wins scored on the lower boards, where Gulnar Mammadova beat Elena Levushkina and Aydan Hojjatova defeated Judit Fuchs. India were trailing to Vietnam but Padmini Rout equalised for 2\u20132 in one of the longest games of the day. === Round 6 === The match of the day was played between the only teams with perfect scores, Russia and Ukraine, on the first match board. The Ukrainian players gained advantage on the first three boards, where Anna Muzychuk was playing versus Alexandra Kosteniuk as White, Mariya Muzychuk versus Valentina Gunina as Black and Natalia Zhukova versus Aleksandra Goryachkina as White. Nonetheless, Gunina found a miraculous resource and tricked her opponent in a position being a rook and three pawns down to survive with a perpetual check (see diagram); Zhukova also did not exploit her advantage and lost her extra pawn to a tactical oversight on move 27 that transposed the game into a drawn endgame. Yet, Anna Muzychuk succeeded to convert her advantage to a full point but Olga Girya was victorious for Russia against Anna Ushenina on the lowest board for a 2\u20132 tie, despite the fact she committed herself to a blunder and gave up a crucial pawn on move 40. On the second match board, Romania surprisingly halted the top-seeded China to draw thanks to the win by Corina Peptan over Ju Wenjun with the White pieces on board one. For the Chinese team, who lacked World Women's Champion Hou Yifan, the only win came from Guo Qi who beat Irina Bulmaga on board four. On the next two match boards, Kazakhstan and Hungary drew in a winless match, while Azerbaijan-1 and Georgia exchanged one win each in another tie. Nana Dzagnidze scored a full point for Georgia Zeinab Mamedyarova as White on board one and Gulnar Mammadova beat Nino Batsiashvili as Black on board three. Thus, all four matches played on the top four match boards ended without winner. Poland were the team playing on the highest board who secured a match victory after beating Vietnam 3\u20131 in a match with four decisive games. Monika So\u0107ko, Karina Szczepkowska-Horowska and Klaudia Kulon scored full points for Poland against Ph\u1ea1m L\u00ea Th\u1ea3o Nguy\u00ean, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Mai H\u01b0ng and Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh An; Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3o Tr\u00e2m won against Jolanta Zawadzka to score the only point for Vietnam. Klaudia Kolun's win was sixth at the tournament, which put her in the lead with a perfect score. India minimally beat Latvia 2\u00bd-1\u00bd thanks to the wins by Harika Dronavalli against Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Soumya Swaminathan against Ing\u016bna Erneste. === Round 7 === The two leading teams after six rounds, Russia and Ukraine, faced Poland and China on the top two tables. The Polish team managed to halt the Russians to a 2\u20132 tie. Valentina Gunina scored once again for Russia by beating Jolanta Zawadzka with the Black pieces in a game in which her opponent was standing well but made several blunders from moves 31-35 and resigned after the move 36, because the Russian spotted a nice attacking combination with a thematic queen sacrifice that would have left her with a rook and a pawn up. On the other hand, Karina Szczepkowska-Horowska levelled the result by beating the Russian champion Aleksandra Goryachkina also with the Black pieces after Goryachkina forced exchange of queens that put her in a passive position and allowed Szczepkowska-Horowska take full control of the two central files with the rooks. The Polish win did even have a chance to clinch a match victory but Alexandra Kosteniuk defended the rook endgame with a pawn down against Monika So\u0107ko on board one. China minimally defeated Ukraine 2\u00bd-1\u00bd thanks to the only decisive game in the match, in which Tan Zhongyi beat Natalia Zhukova as White. The game reached a position out of the opening with strong White pawn on d5, which posed problems for Black throughout most of the game. On move 20, Zhukova mistakenly took on e5 with her d-pawn instead of her bishop on g7, allowing Tan's White d-pawn to roll ahead. The only way to get rid of the strong pawn was to sacrifice an exchange but it resulted in a winning endgame for the Chinese (see diagram). United States beat Romania 2\u00bd-1\u00bd with the only decisive game being played on the second board, where Nazi Paikidze beat Cristina Adela Foi\u0219or with the Black pieces after the Romanian played some imprecise moves that left her with weak pawns on b3 and e3 as well as passive set-up of her pieces, allowing Paikidze to launch a strong attack that could not be defended. After the game, Paikidze said that she had played the best game so far and realised that she had to win the game. Azerbaijan-1 surprised the fifth seeds India with a 2\u00bd-1\u00bd victory as a result of the two wins scored by Gunay Mammadzada on the second and Gulnar Mammadova on the third board. The Netherlands upset the fourth seeded Georgia with the same result in a match with one decisive game by Tea Bosboom-Lanchava who beat Bela Khotenashvili on board three to score her fifth win in six games. Germany and Uzbekistan drew with four decisive games, while Turkmenistan surprised Greece with a 3\u20131 win. === Round 8 === The eighth round saw Russia and the United States playing on the top table, which ended in favour of the American team who won 2\u00bd-1\u00bd. The quickest game to end was the one played on the fourth board, where Kate\u0159ina N\u011bmcov\u00e1 beat Olga Girya in a game that was opened with the French Defence and later reached a critical position in which Girya failed to implement the right plan. However, the Russians evened up the result in the match as Valentina Gunina scored a crushing win over Nazi Paikidze as Black on the second board. On the third board, Natalija Pogonina and Anna Zatonskih seemed to make little progress, despite the fact that Zatonskih had hanging pawns, and the game was drawn. The last game of the match was the one on the top board between Alexandra Kosteniuk and Irina Krush. Krush sacrificed a pawn on move 12, which she later said was not envisioned to be a pawn sacrifice but elimination of her bad pieces, and managed to get an equal compensation with her two knights. As the game reached the time control, Krush claimed a three-fold repetition, which Kosteniuk balked and the arbiters had to move the claim on a side table to confirm that the same position occurred two times and that the game could continue. Kosteniuk sacrificed an exchange in the continuation that left Krush with the winning chances she converted into a full point. China convincingly beat Azerbeian-1 3\u00bd-\u00bd with three wins on the first, second and fourth board scored by Hou Yifan, Ju Wenjun and Tan Zhongyi against Zeinab Mamedyarova, Gunay Mammadzada and Narmin Kazimova, respectively. Hou found nice tactics to win a pawn on move 19, which she later converted into a full point (see diagram). Ju Wenjun scored a win with the Black pieces thanks to a strong knight on c4 and a passed pawn on e4, where the knight dominated on the quenside. Ukraine and Hungary played a match that ended in a tie with wins by Szidonia Vajda over Mariya Muzychuk with the Black pieces on board two for Hungary and Inna Gaponenko against Ticia Gara on board four for Ukraine. Poland beat the Netherlands minimally, despite Monika So\u0107ko's loss to Anne Haast on the top board, as Klaudia Kulon and Mariola Wozniak were victorious on the lower boards. In the other games on the higher tables, Israel beat the 52nd seeds Turkmenistan 2\u00bd-1\u00bd, while Vietnam defeated Romania 3\u20131. === Round 9 === The top five seeds, China, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and India, all won their matches of the ninth round. China beat the United States 2\u00bd-1\u00bd with three draws and one decisive game. Irina Krush neither get anything with the White pieces nor suffered in her game against Hou Yifan on board one that ended in a draw. On the third board, Anna Zatonskih had an advantage against Tan Zhongyi that she did not manage to convert; on the last board, Kate\u0159ina N\u011bmcov\u00e1 and Guo Qi also split the point. The decisive game was played on the second board, where Naz\u00ed Paikidze could not solve the problems on the c-file combined with her early exchange of bishop for a knight and lost the endgame. The win ensured China to solely top the standings after the end of the round. Russia retained the chances for gold after edging out Vietnam 2\u00bd-1\u00bd thanks to the win by Valentina Gunina with the White pieces against Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3o Tr\u00e2m on the second board. Gunina took control over the game, despite falling into a trouble after 19 moves, and scored a full point. It was her seventh point in the eighth game with a rating performance of 2707. Ukraine routed Azerbaijan-1 3\u00bd-\u00bd with wins by the Muzychuk sisters on the first two boards and Inna Gaponenko on the last board. Poland snatched a high 3\u00bd-\u00bd victory on the second table against Israel to remain only a point behind the leader China after nine rounds. Monika So\u0107ko, Jolanta Zawadzka and Mariola Wozniak won for the Polish team, while Klaudia Kulon was the only one halted to a draw. India stopped the Netherlands with a 3\u20131 victory in a match resulting in four decisive games. Harika Dronavalli, Tania Sachdev and Soumya Swaminathan scored wins for India on the first, third and forth board, respectively, while Anne Haast won for the Netherlands on the second board. Georgia beat Turkmenistan 3\u20131, while Germany defeated Serbia with the same result. The game between Bulgaria and Hungary ended 2\u20132 with four draws. One of the most interesting games of the round was the one played on the first board in the match between Greece and Lithuania, in which Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117 played a terrific idea from move 16 with a queen sacrifice in order to achieve a mate on the board after four moves in the game against Stavroula Tsolakidou (see diagram). === Round 10 === The penultimate round featured six of the top seven teams in the standings after nine rounds playing each other. The match between the top two teams in the standings after nine rounds, China and Poland. The Chinese team won narrowly 2\u00bd-1\u00bd as Hou Yifan won with the Black pieces against Monika So\u0107ko on the top board and Tan Zhongyi against Klaudia Kulon on the last board; Jolanta Zawadzka scored the only full point for Poland with her victory with the Black pieces against Ju Wenjun in a game in which the Chinese was down an exchange for nebulous compensation, while Zhao Xue successfully defended a rook endgame that was completely winning for Karina Szczepkowska-Horowska. Russia defeated Georgia 2\u00bd-1\u00bd thanks to the efforts by Alexandra Kosteniuk and Valentina Gunina on the first two boards who beat Nana Dzagnidze and Lela Javakhishvili, respectively. Alexandra Goryachkina drew against Bela Khotenashvili on the third board in a position with no chances for significant progress on the both sides. On the lowest board, Nino Batsiashvili and Olga Girya went into a rook and bishop versus rook endgame that the Russian was not able to hold. Alexandra Goryachkina drew against Bela Khotenashvili in a position with no chances for significant progress on the both sides. Ukraine and India tied with one win per side. Anna Ushenina was victorious for Ukraine against Soumya Swaminathan on the fourth board; Tania Sachdev beat Natalia Zhukova on the third board, who lost her second game in a row that opened with the Benoni Defence. United States were also held to a draw by Mongolia with Nomin-Erdene Davaademberel beating Irina Krush on the first table as White for Mongolia and Kate\u0159ina N\u011bmcov\u00e1 beating Uurtsaikh Uuriintuya on board three as Black for the United States. Krush opted for a passive defence in a rook endgame when it was necessary to play more actively and eventually lost the game (see diagram). On the other high tables, Azerbaian beat Colombia 3\u20131, while Hungary and Bulgaria scored victories with the lowest margin against France and Germany, respectively. === Round 11 === The central attention in the final round received the direct clash for the gold medal between China and Russia on the first table. The reigning champions entered the final round with a two-point deficit, meaning that the Chinese needed only a draw to secure the gold. The match started successfully for Russia as Natalija Pogonina beat Guo Qi with the White pieces on the lowest board. The game on the first board between Hou Yifan and Alexandra Kosteniuk was drawn after 65 moves.
