The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL. \"\u00c0 force de prier\" came towards the start of Mouskouri's career when she was relatively unknown, and despite finishing only mid-table at Eurovision, is credited for providing her voice, style and trademark look with invaluable early exposure to the international audience which would make her one of the biggest stars in European music by the end of the 1960s. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Mouskouri performed last in the running order, following Monaco. Each national jury awarded 5-4-3-2-1 to their top five songs, and at the close \"\u00c0 force de prier\" had picked up 13 points (4 from France, 3 from Germany, 2 from Denmark and Switzerland, and 1 from Finland and Italy), placing Luxembourg 8th of the 16 entries.
