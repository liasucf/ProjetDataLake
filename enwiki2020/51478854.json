    "text": "Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer (Mariana Griswold) is a bronze sculpture by American artist Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It was designed in 1888 and cast in 1890. This artwork portrays the American author, art critic, and reformer Mariana Griswold Van Rensselaer (1851\u20131934), who \"championed Saint-Gaudens in articles on his public monuments and relief sculptures\". The inscription on the upper center of the sculpture, (\"the spirit, not the work\") is a reference to Mrs. Van Rensselaer's \"high-minded aesthetic ideals\". The work was given in 1917 by the sitter to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==References== == External links == * Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer on Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:19th-century sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in New York City Category:Sculptures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens Category:Sculptures of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Sculptures of women in New York City ",
