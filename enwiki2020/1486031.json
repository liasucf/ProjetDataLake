Since district magistrates are responsible for the collection of land revenue in the district, the post is also referred to as the District Collector in terms of the revenue department, and as the office-bearer works under the supervision of a Divisional Commissioner. The post is also known as Deputy Commissioner in several Indian states like Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh etc. In the revenue department, the Deputy Collectors (also called Deputy District Collector) is usually a tehsildars who report into the District Revenue Officer (DRO) who is also called the Additional District Collector and is the overall in-charge of revenue department for the district, DRO in turn reports into the District Collector (also called District Commissioner) who is in-charge of overall management of the district across all departments. Deputy Collectors are hired through State's Service Selection Commission, where as DRO and District Collector are usually Centre Civil Services employees appointed to the state cadre. == History == District administration in India is a legacy of the British Raj. District collectors were members of the Indian Civil Service and were charged with supervising general administration in the district. Warren Hastings introduced the office of the district collector in 1772. Sir George Campbell, lieutenant-governor of Bengal from 1871-1874, intended \"to render the heads of districts no longer the drudges of many departments and masters of none, but in fact the general controlling authority over all departments in each district.\" The office of a collector during the British Raj held multiple responsibilitiesas collector, he was the head of the revenue organization, charged with registration, alteration, and partition of holdings; the settlement of disputes; the management of indebted estates; loans to agriculturists, and famine relief. As district magistrate, he exercised general supervision over the inferior courts and in particular, directed the police work. The office was meant to achieve the \"peculiar purpose\" of collecting revenue and of keeping the peace. The superintendent of police (SP), inspector general of jails, the surgeon general, the divisional forest officer (DFO) and the chief engineer (CE) had to inform the collector of every activity in their departments. Until the later part of the nineteenth century, no native was eligible to become a district collector. But with the introduction of open competitive examinations for the Indian Civil Service, the office was opened to natives. Anandaram Baruah, an eminent scholar of Sanskrit and the sixth Indian and the first Assamese ICS officer, became the third Indian to be appointed a district magistrate, the first two being Romesh Chandra Dutt and Sripad Babaji Thakur respectively. The district continued to be the unit of administration after India gained independence in 1947. The role of the district collector remained largely unchanged, except for the separation of most judicial powers to judicial officers of the district. Later, with the promulgation of the National Extension Services and Community Development Programme by the Nehru government in 1952, the district collector was entrusted with the additional responsibility of implementing the Government of India's development programs in the district. == Posting == They are posted by the state government, from among the pool of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, who either are on Level 11, Level 12 or Level 13 of the Pay Matrix, in the state.
