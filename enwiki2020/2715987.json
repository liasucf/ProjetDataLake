    "text": "\u017dalvarinis (English: made from brass) is a folk rock band from Vilnius, Lithuania. They were formed in 2001 as a collaboration between the pagan metal group Ugn\u0117lakis and the pagan folk group K\u016blgrinda. This was reflected in the title of their debut album in 2002, Ugn\u0117lakis su K\u016blgrinda. == Style == The lyrics for band's songs are usually taken from the folklore of Lithuanian people and are sung in their original Lithuanian language. \u017dalvarinis' music frequently features singing technique of traditional Lithuanian sutartin\u0117 (a form of glee), usually sung by band's three female singers \u2013 examples of sutartin\u0117 can be heard in tracks Ailiom sus\u0117dom, Dij\u016bta or O\u017eys. Authentic pronunciation as well as ancient words and their forms in folk songs are also usually preserved by the band. As a legacy of K\u016blgrinda, the band also features few folk-songs of Old Prussians. \u017dalvarinis's sound, on the other hand, while still influenced by traditional Lithuanian folk music, is more modern \u2013 generally speaking, it's a mix of traditional heavy metal and progressive rock. The first album of the band was metal-influenced, however with later albums, the sound becomes more progressive. The song A\u0161 kanap\u012f s\u0117jau (I Sowed a Hemp), taken from the 2005 album \u017dalio vario was featured on Transformations in Lithuanian Song \u2013 a 2006 compilation CD that covered the development of Lithuanian folk music over many years, published by the Lithuanian-American journal Lituanus. == Members == === Current members === *Robertas Semeniukas \u2013 vocals, electric, acoustic & slide guitars, keyboards, music director *Just\u0117 Kraujelyt\u0117 - vocals *Sigita Jonynait\u0117-B\u016bdien\u0117 \u2013 vocals *Domas \u017dostautas - bass guitar *Jonas Lengvinas - drums === Former members === *Ineta Meduneckyt\u0117-Tamo\u0161i\u016bnien\u0117 \u2013 vocals *Laurita Peleni\u016bt\u0117 \u2013 vocals *Paulius Jask\u016bnas \u2013 bass guitar *Simonas Gudelis \u2013 drums *Aurimas Leme\u017eis \u2013 bass guitar *Marius B\u016bda \u2013 electric guitar *Ram\u016bnas Pocius \u2013 vocals, pipes *Egl\u0117 Pak\u0161yt\u0117 \u2013 vocals *Dariush Loznikoff \u2013 bass *Demonas \u2013 bass *Ar\u016bnas Luka\u0161evi\u010dius \u2013 bass *Ilja Molodcov \u2013 drums *Aidas Buivydas \u2013 guitar === Discography === *Ugn\u0117lakis su K\u016blgrinda (2002, Bomba records) *\u017dalio vario (2005, Prior music) translates as [Made] of Green Copper, green copper being an archaic name for brass) *Folk n' Rock (2008, Monako Productions) *Gyvas (2014, Robertas Semeniukas) *Teka (2016, Robertas Semeniukas) *Einam Tolyn (2018, Robertas Semeniukas) *The Best of \u017dalvarinis (2019, Robertas Semeniukas) == Further reading == * == External links == *Official homepage *https://www.facebook.com/ZalvarinisBand/ *https://www.youtube.com/user/zalvarinisofficial *https://www.instagram.com/zalvarinis_official/ *https://zalvarinis.bandcamp.com *https://soundcloud.com/zalvarinis_music *\u017dalvarinis on Myspace *Encyclopaedia Metallum Category:Lithuanian folk metal musical groups Category:Lithuanian heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Neopagan musical groups Category:Neopaganism in Lithuania Category:Baltic Neopaganism ",
