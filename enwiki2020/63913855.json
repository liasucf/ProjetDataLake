At the end of UNSCOP, Sir Abdur Rahman supported the Minority Plan for a Federal State in Palestine. He also included a Special Note that reflected his desire for either a Federal State or a Unitary state due to his belief in the sanctity of the spirit of the UN Charter. After UNSCOP, Rahman went home to Lahore, which had become a part of Pakistan due to the Partition of India on August 15, 1947. His family, which fled from Delhi after partition, soon joined him. He was later appointed to the Federal Court of Pakistan, a precursor to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. == Personal Life == One of Sir Abdur Rahman's grandchildren is the award-winning chemist and former Minister of Science and Technology of Pakistan, Atta-ur-Rahman from Pakistan.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atta-ur-Rahman_(chemist) == References == == Further reading == Category:University of the Punjab alumni Category:Pakistani judges Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of the Punjab Category:Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations Category:People of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict Category:1888 births Category:1962 deaths ",
