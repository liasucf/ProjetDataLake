It was distinguished as a result of a taxonomic split in the trident bat, A. tridens. The holotype had been collected in 2005 in the Al Mahrah Governorate of Yemen. Its species name \"arabica\" is derived from the Arabian Peninsula where it is found. ==Description== Its forearm length is approximately . The fur of its back is beige or a pale, brownish-gray. The fur may have a yellowish or faint rusty tint. Its belly fur is paler than its back fur. Its flight membranes are also a pale, brownish-gray. ==Range and habitat== It is found in the Middle East, with documented occurrence in southwestern Oman and southeastern Yemen. ==Conservation== As of 2017, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because it was only discovered relatively recently, and thus little is known about its biology and ecology. Additionally, there is no estimate of its population size. ==References== Category:Bats of the Arabian Peninsula Category:Mammals described in 2011 Category:Asellia ",
