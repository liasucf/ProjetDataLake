She was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Samoa (Fono) in the 2006 elections, and was one of four women MPs at the time. In 2009, she formally announced that she had joined the newly formed Tautua Samoa Party. In May 2009, she was consequently expelled from Parliament by the Speaker, due to a rule prohibiting post-electoral party membership changes. Party chairman Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi stated that he would seek an interim injunction against her expulsion, his own, and those of the party's seven other members.
