    "text": "For the Record is a two-disc, 44-track greatest hits package released by the American country music band Alabama. The album chronicles the biggest hits from Alabama released between 1980 and 1998. The lineup includes all 33 of their Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles & Tracks No. 1 singles, as well as other songs which reached number one on the former Radio & Records (now Mediabase) charts; each of the non-Billboard No. 1 hits made the top 5 on that chart. Three new tracks are also included. Of these, \"How Do You Fall in Love\" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in late 1998. The follow-up single, \"Keepin' Up\", reached the Top 20 in early 1999, while \"Five O'Clock 500\" was not released as a single. All of the greatest hits are presented in their single/radio edit forms; in some cases, the songs were nearly two minutes shorter than their original album versions. ==The Essential== For the Record was re-released and re-packaged in 2005 as The Essential. Both albums have an identical track lineup. In his review of The Essential, Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that the new album title eliminated \"the misleading subtitle that claimed all of the songs on the album hit No. 1.\" A disclaimer on the back of the album indicates that The Essential is the reissued For the Record. ==Sales== The original For the Record album was certified platinum for sales of 5 million units by the Recording Industry Association of America. ==Song listing== ;Disc 1 # \"Five O'Clock 500\" (Teddy Gentry, Randy Owen, Ronnie Rogers) \u2013 3:36A # \"Keepin' Up\" (Greg Fowler, Gentry, Owen, Rogers) \u2013 3:05A # \"How Do You Fall in Love\" (Fowler, Gentry, Owen) \u2013 3:00A # \"Tennessee River\" (Owen) \u2013 3:02 # \"Why Lady Why\" (Gentry, Rick Scott) \u2013 3:09 # \"Old Flame\" (Donny Lowery, Mac McAnally) \u2013 3:10 # \"Feels So Right\" (Owen) \u2013 3:35 # \"Love in the First Degree\" (Tim DuBois, Jim Hurt) \u2013 3:18 # \"Mountain Music\" (Owen) \u2013 3:38 # \"Take Me Down\" (Mark Gray, J.P.
