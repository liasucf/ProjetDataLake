Its possible use includes search, rescue, counter-terrorism, as well as scientific experiments and scientific exploration. Mechanical Gecko \"Freelander\" comprehensively utilizes the optical, electromagnetic sensing and new communication methods, and optical, mechanical and electronic integration technology. According to the introduction by Dr. Li, this gecko robot with the artificial intelligence can rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It is able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as the various types of metallic materials. It can also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically. Its flexibility and speed are comparable to the natural gecko. == References == ==Further reading== * Reports on Chinese Science and Technology Daily * Reports on SOHU website ===Other videos on the mechanical gecko=== * http://you.video.sina.com.cn/b/17435805-1569053923.html * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRzMeXtbJRo * http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/1BOD206KD8o/ Category:Climbing robots Category:Quadruped robots Category:Robotic animals Category:Robots of China Category:2008 robots Category:Geckos ",
