    "text": "Signs of the Flesh: An Essay on the Evolution of Hominid Sexuality is a 1985 book about human sexuality by Daniel Rancour-Laferriere, in which the author discusses topics including castration anxiety and the female orgasm. The work has been called a classic. Some reviewers gave it positive reviews, while others provided mixed assessments. ==Summary== Rancour-Laferriere provides an interdisciplinary discussion of human sexuality, drawing on psychoanalysis, sociobiology, and semiotics. He aims to make claims that are falsifiable and thus scientific in the sense understood by the philosopher Karl Popper. He provides evaluations of the work of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and the biologist E. O. Wilson, and considers topics such as the female orgasm, homosexuality, and castration anxiety. He argues, in opposition to the anthropologist Donald Symons in The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1979), that evidence suggests that the female orgasm is adaptive, rather than simply being a byproduct of selection for the male orgasm. He attempts to explain the ways the human penis has been personified and used as a sign, arguing that \"the entities which humans personify are those which are most likely to be involved in the maximization of inclusive fitness.\" ==Publication history== Signs of the Flesh was first published by Walter de Gruyter in 1985. It was republished by Indiana University Press in 1992. ==Reception== Signs of the Flesh received positive reviews from the anthropologist J. Patrick Gray in American Anthropologist, D. S. Apel in The Times Literary Supplement, and Christopher R. Badcock in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. In The Quarterly Review of Biology, the book received mixed reviews from the psychologist David Buss and Charles Crawford. Gray described the book as an \"exciting and important\" work that deserved a wide audience. He credited Rancour-Laferriere with providing a \"grand theory of human sexuality.\" He compared the book to Freud's Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921) and the classicist Norman O. Brown's Love's Body (1966), and wrote that it was \"one of the strongest\" books of its kind. He believed that Rancour-Laferriere's arguments were \"frequently controversial\" but interesting and stimulating. However, he criticized him for failing to present testable claims about human sexuality, maintaining that most of his arguments were \"unfalsifiable speculation\", and that Rancour-Laferriere's speculations ranged from \"very convincing to totally unconvincing.\" He also suggested that evolutionary biologists would question Rancour-Laferriere's claim that social approval is a form of altruism, and that it was sometimes unclear when his arguments were \"limited to the context of evolutionary adaptation and when he intends them to explain the behaviors of modern humans.\" He believed that most readers would not be convinced by Rancour-Laferriere's conclusions about \"the evolutionary origins of human female orgasm and of castration anxiety in males.\" Apel described the book as a \"captivating study\" and compared it to \"the window in a well-assorted sex shop, full of interesting and peculiar devices for the advancement of learning\". Badcock praised Rancour-Laferriere's broad interests and knowledge of many subjects, and the \"wit and humor\" of his work. He suggested that the republication of Signs of the Flesh, in unaltered form, seven years after its original publication showed that the book had become a classic, and described Rancour-Laferriere's bibliography as \"an immense resource\". He believed that the most important part of the work might be to give renewed attention to Freud's work and synthesize it with \"recent evolutionary insights\". However, he considered Rancour-Laferriere's treatment of semiotics the strongest part of the book. He noted that semiotics was less important to understanding human sexuality than psychoanalysis and evolutionary biology, and that it was difficult to reconcile with them, but believed that Rancour-Laferriere made a well-argued case for its relevance. Buss described Rancour-Laferriere's account of hominid sexuality as \"speculative\", and criticized his use of psychoanalysis and semiotics. He questioned Rancour-Laferriere's view that castration anxiety has been a major force in hominid evolution. Nevertheless, he believed that Rancour- Laferriere's attempt to integrate psychoanalysis, semiotics, and evolutionary biology, \"yielded an array of speculations that are among the most fascinating ones yet proffered about hominid sexuality.\" Though he believed that his speculations about the function of the female orgasm were potentially falsifiable, he added that in general he failed to describe the conditions under which his hypotheses could be falsified. Crawford predicted that critics of sociobiology would not like the book. He considered it entertaining and the product of wide reading, but described its approach as \"discursive\", adding, \"I did not get a feeling of depth as I read the book\" and that it \"read more like a well-organized collage than a treatise on human sexuality.\" Nevertheless, he concluded that it was valuable as, \"an introduction to how semiotics, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary biology can be used to help understand human sexuality\". The philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone criticized Rancour-Laferriere's arguments about the personification of the penis. She argued that the problem with explanations such as his is that they ignore the way that human males experience the penis as being out of control. ==References== ===Bibliography=== ;Books * * ;Journals * * * * * Category:1985 non-fiction books Category:Books about orgasm Category:English-language books Category:Indiana University Press books Category:Walter de Gruyter books ",
