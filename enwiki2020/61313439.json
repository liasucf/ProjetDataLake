Especially in the early years, it can be difficult to make a distinction between the two. \"[O]ne of ... [the] basic practices,\" writes David B. Williams, \"was to drive a double row of pilings out from the shoreline, lay timbers across the tops of the pilings to form piers and wharves, and build out atop the wood. They could then dump material under these structures, undertaking the land-making practice known as wharfing out.\"Williams 2015, p.48. It is not possible for a list like this to be complete. In the late 1880s and 1890s, a lack of legal clarity about ownership of lands between the low- and high-tide lines resulted in a massive number of structures on the tideflats, mostly poorly built and short-lived.For example, see image 35 between pages 19 and 20 of (On p. 28 of PDF.) It shows a large number of minor structures\u2014shanties and the like\u2014at the base of the bluff at the foot of Lenora Street. \"The craze for salt water,\" remarked Judge Thomas Burke, had \"broken out again with greater violence than before ... [with] lunatics of high and low degree ... like so many cawing crows on the mudflats.\"quoted in Klingle 2007, p. 54. Even today, there are numerous small, anonymous piers and ruins of piers. The geography of Elliott Bay has changed considerably in the period since people of European ancestry first settled in the Seattle area in the mid-19th century. In particular, virtually all of the Industrial District and Sodo, as well as all of Harbor Island are built on landfill; also, there have been a series of smaller adjustments to the terrain of the Downtown waterfront, including the construction of the Alaskan Way Seawall. In general, when listing variants of names we have not listed minor variants such as \"Yesler Wharf/Yesler's Wharf\". ==Before the Great Fire== Structures from before the Great Seattle Fire, June 6, 1889.

Farther south, the 1890 Anderson map (which, as indicated above, shows rail lines that were not yet completed), shows Railroad Avenue beginning on the West Seattle shore of the bay near the wheat elevators and warehouses, heading roughly east across the bay, then turning to run due north to King Street, a block west of Commercial Street (today's First Avenue South), along the line of today's Alaskan Way South, where it meets the abovementioned line opened in 1887. According to the 1890 Anderson map, this line carried the Portland & Puget Sound Railroad (which appears never to have been built), Northern Pacific Railway's Seattle Terminal Railway, and Seattle & Montana Railroad, an enterprise of James J. Hill'sKlingle 2007, p. 58 that began construction in May 1890 with construction north of Seattle, incorporated the S., L.S. & E. R.R., and began running north from Seattle October 12, 1891, providing a link to the Canadian Pacific Railroad. The east\u2013west line across the bay was completed by 1893. A map from that year shows two significant structures built adjoining the trestle in otherwise open water: * P.H. McMaster Shingle Mill, south of the Downtown waterfront, at the turn in the trestle. * American Lumber Co's Shingle Mill, west of that, a bit east of the middle of the bay. |- |4 |Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad trestle (after 1880 Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad trestle (1)) | |March 7, 1877Williams 2015, p. 71-76. |abandoned 1881 |railroad trestle |Trestle over tideflats |This trestle built by Joe Surber ran south from the King Street Coal Wharf, carrying trains through what has now been filled as part of Seattle's Industrial District; the lines continued to the coal mines at Renton, Washington.

Built by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company, when Harbor Island was completed in 1909 it was the largest artificial island in the world, at 350 acres (1.4 km\u00b2). It appears that no substantial businesses had opened on the island in 1911. Since 1912, the island has been used for commercial and industrial activities. Harbor Island was made from 24 million yd\u00b3 (18 million m\u00b3) of earth removed in the Jackson and Dearborn Street regrades and dredged from the bed of the Duwamish. This list goes clockwise around Harbor Island, starting from the south end. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Name (Alternative names in parentheses) ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image ! scope=\"col\" | Year completed ! scope=\"col\" | Year destroyed ! scope=\"col\" | Type ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- |1 |Port of Seattle Harbor Island Marina |120px Harbor Island Marina, 2007 more images |? |extant |marina for pleasure boats |Harbor Reach, south end of Harbor Island, especially West Waterway | |- |2 |Terminal 18 Park | |? |extant |public park |Harbor Island at Hanford Street, West Waterway |1.1 acre public park Near here in 1918 was the Mullins Saw Mill Co.

In 1903, it had two sheds, each with a pitched roof, and a box-like office/storefront along Railroad Avenue similar to Pier 6/ 57. In 1905 it included a ship's chandler and a fish shop; in 1906, Frank H. Folsom, based there, advertised himself as an electrical contractor also selling telegraph poles, piles, spars and lumber. In 1908, Colman extended the pier west to a length of , added a domed waiting room, and a clock tower on the water end of the pier. Much of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet docked there. In May 1912 the steamer Alameda crashed into Colman Dock, knocked over the clock tower, and plowed into the waiting room. Two piers north, the Flyer Dock was destroyed. A gangplank was set up at Colman Dock as a temporary loading area, but only weeks later it failed under the weight of a crowd of passengers; two people died and 58 more were injured.

An early major tenant was Willis Wilbur Robinson, who ran sternwheelers of hay from the Skagit River. A 1910 source, writing about 1907, says Robinson's hay and grain was \"mostly government supplies\" and that the dock was also used by the U.S. Quartermaster Department. It was also port of call in this era by the Northwestern Steamship Company. Beginning around 1911, signs on the pier show the major tenant as a steamship agent named Dodwell. Beginning in 1916, this was the home of Pacific Net and Twine, later (roughly mid-20th-century) Seattle Marine and Fishing Supply Co. / Pacific Marine Supply Co. In the 1920s and 1930s the fishing fleet gathered there in the spring before heading north. It is now part of the Seattle Aquarium, including the main entrance and the Omnidome. |- |40 |Reliable Oyster & Fish Co.

Grace and Company, Charles Nelson Company, the Matson Navigation Company, and Northwest Fisheries. These two piers were purchased by the Port of Seattle in the mid-1940s, although its use remained the same at that time.

Piers 62 and 63 adjoin directly to one another. Historically, they were used mainly to store newsprint shipped in from Canada. In its early years, the Gaffney Dock served Alaska Commercial Company steamships and the Holden or Virginia Street Dock was home to Northwest Fisheries salmon cannery. These docks were significantly reconfigured several times. From 1991 to 2005, the bare planks of the pier were the site of the \"Summer Nights at the Pier\" concerts, but Pier 62 became too deteriorated for mass gatherings. The piers have generally remained open for more passive uses. The city plans to rehabilitate them as waterfront open space, capable of holding events again. There was at one time a skybridge to these docks across Railroad Avenue from Virginia Street, but the docks are a bit south of Virginia. There appears to be some confusion on historical numbering of piers in this area. Daryl C. McClary, in listing the 1944 name changes, refers to the two Virginia Street Piers before the renaming as Piers 9 & 10, respectively, and gives no pre-1944 numbers to the Fish and Salt Docks. The 1918 Port of Seattle map makes no mention of the Salt Dock, refers to the Fish Dock as \"Pier 9, Whiz Fish Co.\" and groups, apparently at the location of the Virginia Street Piers, \"W.F. Jahn Co, [Pier] 11A, Pier 10, Virginia St. Wharf,\" with the next pier north being \"U.S.Q.M.

Dodwell used the pier as a terminal for the Northland Steamship Company and the Blue Funnel Line. The Washington State Liquor Control Board used the pier as a warehouse during World War II, and the U.S. Coast Guard used the pier as its Seattle base from 1946 to 1955. Its historic uses were superseded by containerization, and it was remodeled to house shops and restaurants. Triad Development bought the pier in 1995, remodeled it in the late 1990s as a headquarters for the ill-fated Go2Net. Immediately before that remodel, in 1998 The Real World: Seattle was filmed there.Pier 70: Home of the Real World Seattle, realworldhouses.com. Accessed online August 14, 2019. Although the pier shed retains its historic shape, it was remodeled after a fire in 1915, remodeled again in the 1970s, and so heavily altered in the late 1990s that it retains only traces of its historic character. |- |} ===Broad Street to Magnolia=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Name (Alternative names in parentheses) ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image ! scope=\"col\" | Year completed ! scope=\"col\" | Year destroyed ! scope=\"col\" | Type ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- |1 |Union Oil Co.
