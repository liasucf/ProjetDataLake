Louvre. Founded in 1218, the church was under Dominican control and used by the city's large Florentine community as their national church. In 1464 they won the right to bury their dead there and they provided most of the money for its improvement and expansion. In 1517 Bartolomeo Panciantichi was the first to add a chapel to the church. He commissioned an oil on panel altarpiece of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary for it in 1522 from Andrea del Sarto, but the artist chose a poor piece of wood and the work remained incomplete and never exhibited in Lyon. In 1526 Thomas I de Gadagne donated the cost of another chapel, where he and his wife were later buried. His nephew and heir Thomas II commissioned Francesco Salviati to paint a work for it showing The Incredulity of Saint Thomas. The banker Leonardo Spiza added a mausoleum to the church, as did another Florentine who commissioned Antonio Rossellino to design it. The church was demolished in 1816, though the entrance arch to one of its chapels can still be seen at 8-10 rue de Sully, where it was reused after the church's demolition. ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==Further reading== *Abb\u00e9 Adolphe Vachet, \u00c0 travers les rues de Lyon, Marseille, Laffitte Reprints, 1982 (1re \u00e9d. 1902), 500 p.
