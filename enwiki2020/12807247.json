The Golden Ambrosian Republic responded and dispatched a total of 3,700 troops under Colleoni to Alessandria. At Bosco Marengo, battle was joined and the French suffered a complete defeat with their general Renaud du Dresnay being captured and later ransomed for 14,000 couronnes. ==Sources== Category:Battles involving the Duchy of Milan Category:1447 in Europe Category:1440s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:15th century in Italy Category:Conflicts in 1447 Category:Battles involving France ",
