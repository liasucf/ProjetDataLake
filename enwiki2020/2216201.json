    "text": "Poi Dog Pondering is an American musical group, noted for its cross- pollination of diverse musical genres, including various forms of acoustic and electronic music. Founded in Hawaii in 1984 by Frank Orrall, initially as a solo project. In 1985 Orrall formed the first line-up of PDP to perform its first concert; at the Honolulu Academy of Arts. The band then embarked on a yearlong Street Performance Busking tour across North America, eventually settling in Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums. In 1992, the band relocated, this time to Chicago, Illinois, where they began to incorporate Orchestral arrangements & elements of Electronic, House Music and Soul music into their Acoustic Rock style. The membership of Poi Dog Pondering has evolved from album to album, with Frank Orrall being the constant since the inception. ==Hawaii / Street performing years; members== During the Hawaii years (1985\u20131986), the band had the following lineup: *Frank Orrall \u2013 Guitar, vocals, marimba, penny whistle *Abra Moore \u2013 Guitar, vocals, accordion *Sean Coffey \u2013 Drums *John \"el John\" Nelson \u2013 Percussion *Kalea Chapman \u2013 Guitar, vocals *Jean Francois Berneron \u2013 Photographer, cook, vocals, recorder *Cliff Kamida \u2013 Guitar, harmonica *Ted Cho \u2013 Mandolin, guitar *Joe Espinda \u2013 Guitar, recording engineer *Matt Miller - Bass, vocals ==Austin years; members== During the Austin years (1987\u20131992), the band had the following lineup: *Frank Orrall \u2013 guitar, tin flute, drums, vocals *Ted Cho \u2013 electric guitar, mandolin, bass *Dave Max Crawford \u2013 organ, trumpet, accordion *Darren Hess \u2013 drum kit (1991\u20131992) *Bruce Hughes \u2013 bass, vocals, guitar *John Nelson \u2013 congas, maracas, tom-toms, background vocals (1989\u20131992) *Dick Ross \u2013 drum kit (1987\u20131990) *Adam Sultan \u2013 electric guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals *Susan Voelz \u2013 violin, guitar, vocals Additionally, the records featured literally dozens of musicians credited as \"Satellite Poi Members\".

Beginning with that third album, 1992's Volo Volo, the band began to experiment with new musical styles, including fully incorporating DJ Cassanova into the line-up.
