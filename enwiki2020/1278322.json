    "text": "Eforie (; historical names (for Eforie Sud): B\u0103ile Movil\u0103, Carmen-Sylva, Vasile Roait\u0103) is a town and a holiday resort on the Black Sea shore, in Constan\u021ba County, Northern Dobruja, Romania. It is located about 14 kilometers south of Constan\u021ba. Techirghiol Lake lies nearby. == History == Eforie Sud, the southern part of the town, was founded by the aristocrat Ion Movil\u0103 in 1899, when he erected a hotel named B\u0103ile Movil\u0103 (Movil\u0103 Spa). In 1928, the spa was renamed Carmen-Sylva, after the pen name of Queen Elisabeth of Romania. In 1950, after the establishment of the Communist regime, the name of the city was changed again to Vasile Roait\u0103 to honor a railway worker shot dead during the Grivi\u021ba strike of 1933. In 1962, the city was renamed yet again to Eforie Sud. In 1966, the city of Eforie was created by merging Eforie Sud with the northern resort Eforie Nord. Formally, the city is composed of Eforie Sud, the administrative centre, and Eforie Nord, a dependent village. Many other hotels were built here over the years, most of them during the communist regime. == Education == \"Carmen Sylva\" High School is the city's only high school (located in Eforie Sud, which also has a general school, while another general school is located in Eforie Nord). == Sports == Besides many summer sports, as beach football, there is a football club named CS Eforie, playing in Liga III. ==Gallery== File:Eforie Nord, beach.jpg|Beach view ==References== Category:Towns in Romania Category:Populated places in Constan\u021ba County Category:Localities in Northern Dobruja Category:Populated coastal places in Romania Category:Spa towns in Romania Category:Seaside resorts in Romania ",
