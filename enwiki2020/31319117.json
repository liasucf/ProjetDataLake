Followers of Vaishnavism, as well as other schools of Hinduism, believe that a great Guru can teach disciples even after the guru is no longer in a physical body. Communication between the visible and invisible is taken for granted and is an essential factor in many types of Hinduism. Chaitanya is assumed to be in charge of his lineage even today. Swami Prakashanand Saraswati described: > Our tradition of raganuga bhakti is eternal. It comes from the Vedas. Around > 3,102 BC Krishna Himself descended on the earth planet in His Divine form > and Ved Vyas re-established the same knowledge through the Bhagwatam which > continues until today. Five hundred years ago, the descension of Radha in > the form of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu further revealed, rejuvenated and > established this form of devotion which became the guideline for the > devotees of today. This tradition is called achintya bhedabhed vad. Apart from a life oriented on either sense gratification or the practice of yogic and psychic disciplines (considered to be merely the exploration of the inner world of maya), Swami Prakashanand Saraswati taught the path of God's love and the development of an affinity toward, and personal feeling of love for Godhead Personality. This devotional approach is explained in the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and the Bhagavata Purana. It is centred upon the remembrance of Krishna and chanting his name while devotionally offering one's emotional feeling to Him. ==History== Swami Prakashanand Saraswati was born in a respectable brahmin family in 1929 in Ayodhya,Melton, J.G. 1993. Encyclopedia of American Religions. Gale Research India. His early life was fraught with intense religious feelings, and as a youth he became a reclusive mystic so that he might find God.

Maxwell Cade co-developed the \"Mind Mirror\", a portable EEG machine that could monitor the alpha, beta, delta and theta rhythms from each brain hemisphere simultaneously. In the 1970s, a number of eastern religious teachers expressed an interest in participating in Maxwell Cade's research, and agreed to have their brain rhythms measured. In 1976 when he was touring England, Swami Prakashanand Saraswati requested to participate in Dr. Maxwell Cade's research. Dr. Maxwell Cade and his team found patterns they had not seen before. Maxwell Cade concluded that the Swamis' spiritual training conferred unusual powers of healing and perception. Dr. Cade spent two weeks with Prakashanand Saraswati to measure his brainwaves, and he always seemed to be in this \"Awakened Mind\" pattern.Cade, M. 1977. The Awakened Mind, Biofeedback and the Development of Higher States of Awareness. Delacorte Press Furthermore, he measured brainwave patterns, only previously measured in a few rare individuals, that Maxwell Cade characterizes as the \"State beyond the Awakened Mind\". Cade commented: \". . . he has attained to that level of consciousness at which he is in the higher reaches of meditation and in everyday waking consciousness at the same time\".\"Chapter 7: The healing response \u2013 a new direction\" Retrieved 8 Nov On one occasion, Maxwell Cade says that Saraswati \"produced the most beautiful fifth-state pattern on the Mind Mirror for more than an hour while engaging in an intense debate with Professor John Hasted, a noted physicist\". Saraswati wanted to test out the effects of his new form of meditation called the \"Divine Love Meditation.\" He had Maxwell Cade test subjects while listening to a tape consisting of chanting and they measured the effects. According to Cade, both experienced and non-meditators were able to produce a form of \"Awakened Mind\" pattern while listening to these tapes. He writes, \"Those who have close contact with His Divinity know that he remains continually in his Divine-Love transcendence. This corresponds to what Carl Jung termed 'the Transcendent Function.'\" Further, Cade writes that he \"had not seen anyone who could equal Swamiji's feat of touching a number of subjects on the head and immediately raising their pattern of consciousness by two levels, from the ordinary waking state into the advanced fifth state. In at least one of these subjects, the higher state persisted for three days and was an unforgettable experience.\" Cade's wife reportedly had an \"unforgettable experience\" from meeting Swami Prakashanand Saraswati and participating in the study. Maxwell Cade characterised it as \"an experience of great impact\". It was, he wrote later: \". . . a perfect opportunity to study his remarkable EEG patterns under varying circumstances, to discuss the application of scientific methods to the study of meditation, and to learn about Divine Love Meditation at the feet of this great Master\". Cade published his research in his \"landmark book\",Goleman, D. 2008. Measuring the Immeasurable: The Scientific Case for Spirituality. Sounds True The Awakened Mind. Cade's research with Swami Prakashanand Saraswati has also been discussed in several other publications including by Hill (1979), Inglis & West (1983), Treece (1989)Treece, P. 1979. The sanctified body. Doubleday and Peake (2013). Cade showed evidence for temporary and in some cases long-term elevation of state even after twenty minutes of Divine Love Meditation. ==Trial, conviction and disappearance== In 2007, three former residents of Barsana Dham (Radha Madhav Dham), aged between 27 and 30 years old,Swamy convicted of molestation in US.

However, Saraswati didn't show up for his trial and his disciples and legal team said that they didn't know his whereabouts.

Hays County attempted to keep the amount secret but a Nov 2011 ruling from the state Attorney General's office made it clear that the amount is clearly public record.
