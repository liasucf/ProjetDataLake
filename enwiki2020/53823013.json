For the final round of selection, Davy had the ninth pick - he chose the Cookes, Anna had the tenth pick - she chose the McArdles, Derval had the eleventh pick - she chose the Mandiangus, which meant Donncha was left with the Prendergasts. The first round took place across two locations in Dublin. The three heats happened in Poolbeg while the eliminators took place at Kilternan ski-slope. The second round took place in Sligo Airport and Strandhill beach. The quarterfinals took place at Hell & Back, while the semi-finals came from Dublin Docklands.
