    "text": "\"People Give In\" is a song by the Manic Street Preachers. It was released as a single, the sixth, in July 2018 from their thirteenth album Resistance Is Futile. ==Background and reception== As for the lyrics of the song Wire stated that: \"One of the most open lyrics I\u2019ve ever written. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a rallying cry, it\u2019s more about the idea that at least 80% of life is just really mundane so why don\u2019t we all just lower our expectations and try to get to the other side as painlessly as possible. We\u2019re all looking for universal panaceas all the time \u2013 if we expected a little less, we\u2019d probably be happier The chorus is 'there is no theory of everything/no immaculate conception, no crime to forgive'. If you can\u2019t do any good, do no harm - that\u2019s my motto!\" The single was released after a period where the band completed their tour and were asked to perform in Meltdown by The Cure's Robert Smith. ===Reception=== The song was well received with The Quietus saying that it \"is an acceptable statement of intent\", while the NME said that the song is one where they \"mourn for man growing tired, old, forgotten and being sold. But rather than collapsing under the weight of the sorrow of how 'there is no theory of everything', the band gloriously rise from the ashes \u2013 driven by their hardened will just to exist and grow stronger.\" ==Personnel== Manic Street Preachers * James Dean Bradfield \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, keyboards * Nicky Wire \u2013 bass guitar * Sean Moore \u2013 drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Manic Street Preachers songs Category:Songs written by Sean Moore (musician) Category:Songs written by Nicky Wire Category:Songs written by James Dean Bradfield ",
