He left in 1956 for San Jose State College, where he was coached by Lloyd (Bud) Winter. He first achieved national fame by equalling the world record of 9.3 for 100 y as a college junior, in San Jose on April 12, 1958.Progression of IAAF World Records 2011 Edition, Editor Imre Matrahazi, IAAF Athletics, p 506.\"San Jose College Star Ties World 100-Yard Dash Mark\". Jet. May 1, 1958. The next year, 1959, was an outstanding one. He won three gold medals at the 1959 Pan American Games and he tied Leamon King's record at the 100 m at 10.1 s in San Jose on April 18.Mt. SAC Relays Athletes Hall of Fame Profile His achievements in 1959 were recognised by being voted Track and Field News's United States Men's Athlete of the Year \u2013 the inaugural award of this honour.U.S. Men's Athletes of the Year. Track and Field News's Pathe Highlights of Norton's 200 world record at the Penn Relays In 1960, Norton carried on his impressive form of the previous year by tying four world records: he equalled the 220 y record of 20.6 s in Berkeley on March 19; equalled again the 100 y record of 9.3 s in San Jose on April 2; equalled the 200 m record of 20.6 s in Philadelphia on April 30; and equalled the newly set record for the 200 m of 20.5 s in Stanford on July 2. He qualified for the 100 and 200 at the 1960 Olympics by coming first in both events at the United States Olympic Trials, equalling the world record in the process in the 200 m. However, his form at the Olympics itself deserted him, most probably because of nerves, and he finished a disappointing last in both the 100 and 200 m finals. Norton's failure on Thursday September 1 in the 100 m was one of such disasters that befell American favorites that day and the day was to become known as 'Black Thursday'. He tried to make amends for his failures in the individual events in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. The team of Frank Budd, Norton, Stone Johnson and Dave Sime finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. The West German team who finished second in 39.5 s received the gold medals and became the new world record holders.R Hymans (2008) The History of the United States Olympic Trials \u2013 Track & Field, USA Track & Field Norton came to the attention of the world's press at the Olympics for more than his athletic tribulations when he was seen courting his fellow American sprint star and public favorite Wilma Rudolph.David Maraniss (2008) Rome 1960 \u2013 Olympics That Changed The World, Simon & Schuster. 100 m final at the 1960 Olympics, Norton is 3rd from right Early in 1960, College and the social work degree he was working on.
