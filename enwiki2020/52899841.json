During World War I he served first on the battleships Roma and Conte di Cavour, then on the armored cruiser Pisa and finally, as the first fire control officer, on the battleship Dante Alighieri. At the end of the war, he was assigned to the Technical Office of Naval Weapons in Venice and stationed on the repair ship Quarnaro.Enrico Baroni on the Website of the Italian Navy He was then given command of the torpedo boat Cortellazzo and, after promotion to Lieutenant Commander, of the destroyer . In 1932 he was promoted to Commander and appointed executive officer of the heavy cruiser Fiume, and afterwards he held the post of Superior Commander in the Far East, with insignia on the minelayer Lepanto. After repatriation, he was promoted to Captain and appointed commander of the Cagliari Naval Command for a period, before being given command of the light cruiser Luigi Cadorna. In 1940 he was given command of 2nd Destroyer Squadron, with flag on Espero. On June 27, 1940, the Espero, along with sisterships Ostro and Zeffiro, sailed from Taranto for Tobruk in a fast transport mission of some batteries of anti-tank guns; on the following day, however, the three destroyers, sighted by British reconnaissance planes, were intercepted five British light cruisers under Vice Admiral John Tovey. Baroni decided to hold back the British cruisers with his ship as long as possible, so as to give Ostro and Zeffiro the time needed to escape; Espero's sacrifice in fact allowed the two sister ships to escape and reach Benghazi and then Tobruk. Espero, after a solitary two-hour battle against Tovey's ships, was finally hit by the cruiser's fire, left dead in the water, and finished off by HMAS Sydney. After giving orders for the scuttling and the abandonment of the ship, Baroni returned to the bridge and went down with his ship. He was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. == References== Category:1892 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Recipients of the Gold Medal of Military Valor Category:Regia Marina Category:People lost at sea Category:Italian military personnel killed in World War II Category:Captains who went down with the ship Category:People from Florence ",
