    "text": "Opisthocoelicaudiinae is a clade of titanosaurian dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous, ranked as a subfamily. It was named by John McIntosh in 1990. Opisthocoelicaudiines are known from China, Mongolia, and the United States. Three genera were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudiinae by Gonzalez et al. (2009): Alamosaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia (the type genus) and Pellegrinisaurus, although only Alamosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia were found within the group by D\u00edez D\u00edaz et al. (2018). The hands of opisthocoelicaudiines lacked wrist bones and phalanges. ==References== Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs Category:Saltasaurids de:Opisthocoelicaudiinae ",
