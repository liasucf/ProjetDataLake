Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 ==Reception== In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden notes \"This duo concert by pianist Kenny Barron and guitarist Ted Dunbar is excerpted from a 1975 concert at Rutgers University, where both of them were teaching at the time. Barron and Dunbar (who made a number of recordings, but very few as a leader or co-leader) mesh very well together ... The duo tracks are long but never run out of gas ... There are also solo features for each man\" == Track listing == # \"Summertime\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, DuBose Heyward) \u2013 14:55 # \"Here's That Rainy Day' (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) \u2013 10:07 # \"Aruba\" (Kenny Barron, Ted Dunbar) \u2013 18:10 # \"On the Trail\" (Ferde Grof\u00e9) \u2013 6:50 == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano (tracks 1\u20133) *Ted Dunbar \u2013 guitar (tracks 1, 3 & 4) == References == Category:Kenny Barron live albums Category:Ted Dunbar live albums Category:1980 live albums Category:Muse Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Michael Cuscuna ",
