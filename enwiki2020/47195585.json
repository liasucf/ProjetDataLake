One would hardly call the arrangement organic, but that fits the mood. The two spontaneous lovers promise they won\u2019t regret what\u2019s to come, even though both know it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s an inevitability that many will relate to.\" ==Commercial performance== The song debuted at number 33 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated of August 29, 2015, the week the album was released, selling 13,000 copies in its first week.
