It is the main foreign intelligence agency in Sweden and as such is responsible for providing intelligence to both the Government of Sweden and the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces. It is also manages the security for vital divisions and agencies of the Swedish Armed Forces. ==Departments== MUST consists of three known departments: ; Underr\u00e4ttelsekontoret (UNDK, Intelligence Office): Tasked with acquiring strategic intelligence for Central Command and Ministry of Defence decision-making, as well as aiding deployed Swedish military units. ; S\u00e4kerhetskontoret (S\u00c4KK, Security Office): Tasked with electronic and cyberwarfare, counterintelligence, cryptography, and personnel vetting. ;Kontoret f\u00f6r S\u00e4rskild Inh\u00e4mtning (KSI, Office for Special Assignment): Tasked with espionage, including human intelligence and interagency relations, as well as clandestine activities. Little is known about KSI, as it is only mentioned once in Swedish law. MUST also co-operates with other defence intelligence agencies, such as the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA), the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV). In contrast to common belief, FRA is not a part of MUST, but a civil agency. Current Director of MUST is Major General Lena Hallin. Even though MUST is technically a part of the military, a majority of the staff is civilian. ==Directors== * 1993\u20131999: Erik Rossander * 1999\u20132003: H\u00e5kan Syr\u00e9n * 2004\u20132007: H\u00e5kan Pettersson * 2007\u20132012: Stefan Kristiansson * 2012\u20132019: Gunnar Karlson * 2019\u2013present: Lena Hallin ==See also== *S\u00e4rskilda operationsgruppen ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Swedish intelligence agencies Category:Military of Sweden Category:Information sensitivity Category:National security institutions ",
