    "text": "Corona del Mar State Beach (Spanish for the Crown of the Sea) is a protected beach in the state park system of California, United States. It is located in Corona del Mar, Newport Beach, and operated by the city of Newport Beach. The park was established in 1947. ==History== The beach had been a surfing hotspot until the late 1930s, when the Newport Harbor jetty was extended, leading to the creation of The Wedge as a popular surf break, but shielding Corona from all but the most southerly swells. Surfing legend Duke Kahanamoku is credited with the first use of a surfboard for rescue purposes at Corona del Mar beach in 1925, when a charted fishing vessel capsized in heavy surf and Kahanamoku rescued people via surfboard. ==See also== *List of beaches in California *List of California state parks **List of California State Beaches ==References== ==External links== *Corona del Mar State Beach Category:Beaches of Southern California Category:California State Beaches Category:Newport Beach, California Category:Parks in Orange County, California Category:Protected areas established in 1947 Category:Surfing locations in California Category:1947 establishments in California Category:Beaches of Orange County, California ",
