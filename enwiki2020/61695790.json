Lambda Istanbul's human rights lawyer F\u0131rat S\u00f6yle, who had previously served as a consultant to Y\u0131ld\u0131z, said that three months before the murder, Y\u0131ld\u0131z filed a complaint with the district attorney's office after receiving death threats from his family, but the prosecutor's office refused to initiate an investigation or provide protection to Y\u0131ld\u0131z. Y\u0131ld\u0131z's murder event had wide repercussions in the local and foreign press. British newspaper The Independent also covered the issue and stated that cases of honor killing were not limited to Turkey.Independent: Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z ilk e\u015fcinsel namus cinayeti kurban\u0131 m\u0131?

Ms. \u00dcmm\u00fchan, who was injured in the incident, also helped us by opening the case. I thank her. It is surprising that the murderers of my darling Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z have not been caught. Together we went to the prosecutor's office and reported that his family had been making death threats. I think we're experiencing gay discrimination. That wouldn't be the case if my lover was a woman. But that's my choice, and it's nobody's business.\" The case is postponed to a later date for the collection of evidence.\u0130lk gay namus cinayetinin davas\u0131 ba\u015flad\u0131 Radikal. Retrieved 14 June 2010. After the 6th hearing, Can stated that he would start the ECtHR process, and stated: \"Murderers are not coming out. An international arrest warrant has not yet been issued. I want this warrant issued at the next hearing. The court should abandon its homophobic attitude. This has now become a political cause. The court does not show the will, determination and effort to arrest the [victim's] father. In a homophobic country, it will not be desirable for them to clarify this case.\" == Zenne Dancer == The film Zenne Dancer, based on a story inspired by the murder of Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z and directed by Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z's friends Caner Alper and Mehmet Binay, was released on 13 January 2011. ==See also== Honour killings of people of Turkish national origin * Fadime \u015eahindal (Sweden) * Hatun S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc (Germany) == References == == External links == * Website opened for Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131z to indicate the developments related to the case Category:1982 births Category:2008 deaths Category:2008 in Turkey Category:Deaths by person in Asia Category:Honor killing in Asia Category:Honor killing victims Category:LGBT people from Turkey Category:Male murder victims Category:Murder in 2008 Category:Turkish murder victims Category:Victims of anti-LGBT hate crimes Category:Violence against gay men Category:Violence against men in Asia ",
