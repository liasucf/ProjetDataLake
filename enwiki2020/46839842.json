They are usually filled with shrimp and pork belly, often being topped with fried shallots and served with sweet chili fish sauce. It is said to have originated from Hu\u1ebf, as the city was once the imperial capital of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty and known for having simple, yet sophisticated dishes. ==Etymology== The dish's name is believed to have come from its clear, dumpling-like appearance, as the term b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc loosely translates to \"clear flour cake.\" In Vietnamese, the word b\u00e1nh can mean \"cake\" or \"bread,\" but can also be used as a general term for foods that are made from any type of flour, the most common being rice or tapioca. B\u1ed9t literally means flour, although it does not specify the type, and l\u1ecdc means \"refine\" or \"clarify.\" ==Variation== B\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc can either be steamed or boiled and wrapped with or without banana leaf. With the banana leaf wrapping, it is called b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc l\u00e1, meaning \"clear flour cake with leaf.\" Without the banana leaf wrapping, it is called b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc tr\u1ea7n, meaning \"clear flour cake bare.\" The filling is traditionally a whole grilled shrimp with the shell on and a slice of pork belly, but variations have had the filling be shrimp without the shell, no pork belly, ground pork, mushrooms, and onions. In addition to tapioca flour, corn starch and rice flour have also been known to be added in the making the translucent wrapper. B\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc l\u00e1 contains shrimp and pork belly B\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc tr\u1ea7n containing shrimp, ground pork, and mushrooms ==Production== B\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc tr\u1ea7n is made by adding boiling water with tapioca starch, then mixing and kneading until a smooth, soft, and elastic dough is formed. The dough is then divided into small balls and flattened, where the filling is placed in the middle. The dough gets folded over the filling and the edges pinched together to seal the filling in and creating a dumpling shape. The dumplings are cooked in boiling water, then drained and rinsed with cold water. Making b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc l\u00e1 is similar to making b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc tr\u1ea7n. The dough is placed in blanched banana leaves, some filling is added in the center, and then some more dough is placed on top to cover the filling. The banana leaves are then wrapped tightly and tied together with small strands of banana leaf before being steamed. Regardless of the method, the dish can be frozen for later use. ==Health concerns== Tapioca starch is made from cassava root. If prepared incorrectly, cassava root can be highly toxic as it naturally contains linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside, which upon ingestion will release cyanide in the gut. Prolonged ingestion can result in acute cyanide poisoning, a goiter, spastic paraparesis, or ataxic neuropathy. ==See also== * List of steamed foods ==References== ==External links== * Video showing how b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc tr\u1ea7n is made * Video showing how b\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc l\u00e1 is made Category:Shrimp dishes Category:Pork dishes Category:Vietnamese cuisine Category:Dumplings Category:Steamed foods ",
