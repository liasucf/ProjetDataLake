Classic Adventure is a remake of the 1976 text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure. ==Gameplay== As a text based game it starts with the opening \"You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully\". From here it is up to the player to decide how to explore the caves in the game. There are obstacles that must be overcome and treasure to bring back to the house. ==References== Category:1982 video games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Commodore 16 and Plus/4 games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:MSX games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:ZX81 games Category:ZX Spectrum games ",
