    "text": "Arms and the Covenant is a 1938 non-fiction book written by Winston Churchill. It was later published in the United States as While England Slept; a Survey of World Affairs, 1932\u20131938. It highlighted the United Kingdom's lack of military preparation to face the threat of Nazi Germany's expansion and attacked the current policies of the British government, led by the Conservative Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The book galvanised many of his supporters and built up public opposition to the Munich Agreement. John F. Kennedy was inspired by the book's title when he published his thesis, which he wrote during his senior year at Harvard College and in which he examined the reasons for Britain's lack of preparation. Originally titled Appeasement in Munich, it was titled Why England Slept upon its 1940 publication. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1938 non-fiction books Category:1938 in England Category:Books about international relations Category:Books about the United Kingdom Category:Books about politics of the United Kingdom Category:Books by Winston Churchill Category:Non-fiction books about diplomacy Category:World War II books Category:Books about foreign relations of the United Kingdom ",
