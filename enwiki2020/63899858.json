    "text": "First of October is an American-Canadian indie rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 2018. It was formed between musicians and YouTubers Rob Scallon and Andrew Huang from an idea they had where they would go into a recording studio and write and record an entire 10-track album in one 10-12 hour recording session. The duo's name is derived from the day that they recorded their first album, \"Ten Hours\". The band recorded and released a second such album in 2019, with plans to repeat the project annually. == History == The duo first formed in late 2018 because of a YouTube video idea they had where they would go into Uptown recording studio and record an album in a single 10 hour session. The first album, \"Ten Hours\" was recorded on October 1, 2018, and released for free on October 15 the same year. The album was mixed and produced by Rob Ruccia of Uptown Recording. There was no tour to support the album, which was self-released online. Huang announced the breakup of the band in a video containing all the album's songs, \"The band name is the First of October. Because that was the day we recorded the album, and the band doesn't exist any other day of the year.\" Exactly one year after the recording of their first album, the band announced in a rerelease of the their song \"Don't Go\" (featuring Brandon Acker on theorbo) that they had reunited in the studio to record a second album to be released later that month. This time there were more instruments than the last time they recorded, now featuring a piano, synth, 12-string electric guitar, and a short scale electric guitar. For this session they gave themselves an extra 2 hours for lunch and a break. The album, called \"Gourmet Ravioli\" (In reference to a song on the album titled \"Ravioli\") was recorded in a single 12-hour session and was released for free on October 26, 2019. At the end of the behind the scenes video on Scallon's YouTube channel, he hinted at another album for 2020, saying, \"Thanks for being such a fan of our one day a year band. See you next year.\" These plans were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Scallon announced on Twitter. == Band members == Current lineup * Rob Scallon \u2013 lead and backing vocals, lead and rhythm guitars, bass guitar, drums, synthesizer * Andrew Huang \u2013 lead and backing vocals, rhythm and lead guitars, drums, bass guitar, piano, synthesizer == Discography == * Ten Hours (2018) * Gourmet Ravioli (2019) == References == Category:Indie rock musical groups from Illinois ",
