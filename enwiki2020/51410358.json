    "text": "Libya competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. The country has three sportspeople competing in two sports. ==Disability classifications== Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Athletics== Waleed Ashteebah is competing in the Men's Javelin Throw - F44 event, and is classified F42. ;Men's Field {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |-align=center !Athlete !Events !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Waleed Ashteebah |align=left|Shot Put F42 |colspan=2|Did not start |-align=center |align=left|Javelin F42-44 |30.45 |14 |} ==Powerlifting== Ghazalah AlaqouriSahar Elgnemi Ghazalah Alaqouri and Sahar Elgnemi are Libya's two powerlifting competitors. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Result !Rank |- align=center |align=left|Sahar Elgnemi |align=left|Women's \u221279 kg |85 |8 |- align=center |align=left|Ghazalah Alaqouri |align=left|Women's +86 kg |colspan=2|No Mark |} == See also == *Libya at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Paralympics ",
