Schooled in Jean-Zay, La Zup, Niort, his passion for squash was ignited through his father's legacy. Jean- Michel Masotti was himself a nationally ranked squash player before he, his wife Anne, and their newborns Marion and Baptiste settled in La Moucherie, Saint-Liguaire, Niort, in the late 1990s. At Olympique L\u00e9odgarien, Baptiste played along several soon-to-become notable players such as Alex Math\u00e9- Cathala, whose superior footballing abilities were evident even as a child. Beyond squash, Baptiste Masotti also boasts a passion for railways and, amongst all, consistently refers to the \"rails de Saint-Liguaire\" [sic] as a \"turning point in [his] life\". ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:French male squash players ",
