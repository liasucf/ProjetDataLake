    "text": "Los Capos (Spanish for \"The Bosses\") was a Lucha Libre stable consisting of Cien Caras, M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 (often written as \"Dos Mil\") and Universo 2000, and at one point also included Apolo Dant\u00e9s. Los Capos is also often referred to as Los Hermanos Dinamita (Spanish for \"The Dynamite Brothers\") when working without Apolo Dant\u00e9s as Cien Caras, M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 and Universo 2000 are brothers. They have worked primarily in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) but also worked in AAA and currently do guest spots for the International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) ==History== Los Hermanos Dinamita was formed in the late 1980s after Universo 2000 made his professional wrestling debut and began working with his older brothers Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000. It was not until the early 1990s that the group began to work together on a regular basis when all three brothers worked for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) that the trio began to get noticed. While they worked as a team their biggest success came in individual competition, especially the oldest brother Cien Caras who won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. When former CMLL booker Antonio Pe\u00f1a left the promotion to form Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n, later known simply as \"AAA\", jumped ship with him to continue with Konnan and became an integral part of the AAA's heavyweight division in its formative years. Cien Caras was a key factor in the events that led to the largest crown in Mexican wrestling history, 48,000 people, at Tripleman\u00eda I. While still working for CMLL Los Hermanas Dinamitas had won the Mexican National Trios Championship from Octag\u00f3n, Atlantis and M\u00e1scara Sagrada and when they left CMLL they took the championship with them to AAA. The team held on to the Trios Title until they were defeated on April 26, 1994 almost three years after winning it. By the mid-1990s the group broke up as the brothers left AAA one by one to work on the Mexican Independent wrestling circuit or returned to CMLL. M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 wearing his mask in November 2018 Universo 2000 was the first to return to CMLL and saw a lot of success as an individual wrestler, capturing the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on three separate occasions. after the turn of the millennia Universo 2000 was joined by his older brothers as well as CMLL veteran Apolo Dant\u00e9s, collectively known as \"Los Capos\", although the brothers were still referred to as \"Los Hermanos Dinamita\" when they appeared without Dant\u00e9s. The group was a fixture in the heavyweight division, often helping Universo 2000 retain his title through unfair means. Los Capos worked mainly trios matches, most often as Rudos (the Spanish term for a \"wrestling villain\"), although at time they were cheered when working against other Rudos such as Pierroth Jr. or \"Los Talibanes\" (Emilio Charles Jr., Scorpio Jr. and Bestia Salvaje). By 2004 Los Capos were winding down their in-ring activities with the retirement of Cien Caras in the works. The retirement storyline involved Los Capos feuding with Perro Aguayo Jr. and his father, Lucha Libre legend Perro Aguayo. This started out with Aguayo Jr. and El Terrible defeating Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match where Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 had put their hair on the line. After being shaved bald Los Capos attacked Perro Aguayo Jr. only to see Perro, Sr. run in to make the save. By the end of 2004 it was announced that Cien Caras would wrestle his last match on December 27, 2004 in a Luchas de Apuesta match teaming with M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 against Pierroth Jr. and Vampiro Canadiense. Los Capos won the match and Cien Caras had a retirement ceremony after the match. The retirement was short lived as Caras ran in during a show and attacked Perro Aguayo Jr. stating that he had unfinished business with the young Aguayo and his father. The storyline culminated in a match at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show where Perro Sr. came out of retirement to team with his son, defeating Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 in a hair vs. hair match that saw Los Capos shaved bald once again. After the storyline with the Aguayos ended Los Capos slowly faded from CMLL. Apolo Dant\u00e9s began working as a booker and trainer while Los Hermanos Dinamita worked a reduced scheduled before leaving CMLL completely. ==Los Capos Junior== In 2006 a group called Los Capos Junior or Los Dinamitas Junior began working for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), supposedly the sons of Los Hermanos Dinamita. While Cien Caras, M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 and Universo 2000 all made IWRG appearances, endorsing Los Junior Capos it was later confirmed that most of the Juniors are not actually related to Los Hermanos Dinamita. El Hijo de Cien Caras (Spanish for \"the son of Cien Caras\") previously worked as \"Suplex\" and is actually the brother of L.A. Park. Cien Caras, Jr. previously worked as \"Sheriff\", he is also not a blood relation of Cien Caras. M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000, Jr. has been confirmed as being the son of M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 and it is believed Hijo de M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 is as well, although that remains unconfirmed. ==Nueva Generaci\u00f3n Dinamita== Sans\u00f3n, El Cuatrero and Forastero outside the ring in November 2018 In late 2015 , Sans\u00f3n and El Cuatrero (sons of Cien Caras) teamed with Forastero (a nephew of the entire Los Capos group) to create \"Nueva Generaci\u00f3n Dinamita\" , the team later won the Occidente Trios Championship. all three participated in the La Copa Junior 2017. Cuatrero was placed in Block A and Sans\u00f3n and Forastero were placed in Block B. Cuatrero defeated The Panther and Drone before losing to eventual winner Soberano Jr.. Forastero defeated Stigma before being eliminated by Blue Panther Jr. and Sans\u00f3n defeated Star Jr. , Blue Panther Jr. and Esfinge qualifying for the finals where he was defeated by Soberano Jr.. all three participated in the Torneo Gran Alternativa where a young (novato) wrestler teams with an older, more experienced wrestler. for the tournament Sans\u00f3n teamed up with \u00daltimo Guerrero, Forastero with Mascara A\u00f1o 2000 and Cuatrero and Shocker. Sans\u00f3n and \u00daltimo Guerrero defeated Pegasso and Blue Panther and Atlantis and Esfinge before losing to Soberano Jr. and Car\u00edstico in the finals. Shocker and Cuatrero defeated Stigma and Tit\u00e1n before losing to Esfinge and Atlantis. Forastero and Mascara A\u00f1o 2000 lost to Atlantis and Esfinge, not making it through the first round. On July 22, 2017, Sans\u00f3n and Cuatrero defeated Black Terry and Negro Navarro to win the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. on July 25, the team defeated Mephisto , Luciferno and Ephesto to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. At the CMLL 84th Anniversary Show , they lost to Diamante Azul , Marco Corleone and Valiente. November 3, the team participated in a torneo cibernetico to crown the first CMLL Rey del Inframundo Champion also featuring Hechicero, M\u00edstico, Diamante Azul, Soberano Jr. and Valiente that saw Sans\u00f3n pin Soberano to win the match and the championship. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre **Mexican National Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 **Mexican National Trios Championship (1 time) - Cien Caras, M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 and Universo 2000 ;Cien Caras *Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre **CMLL World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ;Universo 2000 *Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre **CMLL World Heavyweight Championship (3 times) ==Luchas de Apuestas record== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100% style=\"text-align: center\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Winner (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Loser (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Location !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Event !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=15% scope=\"col\"|Date !class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=5% scope=\"col\"|Notes |- |Perro Aguayo, Jr. and El Terrible (hair) || Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || |- |Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 (hair) || Pierroth, Jr. and Vampiro Canadiense (hair) || Mexico City || Sin Piedad || || |- |Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo Jr. (hair) || Cien Caras and M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || |} ==References== Category:Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre teams and stables Category:Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide teams and stables ",
