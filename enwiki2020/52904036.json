The offices he served in included Secretary of State of Vermont. ==Biography== Townsend was born in Oyster Bay, New York on May 13, 1749. The son of Micajah Townsend and Elizabeth Platt, he graduated from Princeton University in 1766, and received a master's degree in 1769. Townsend studied law, was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in White Plains. He was appointed secretary of Westchester County's Committee of Safety, and in June 1776 he was commissioned as a captain and appointed to command a company in the New York militia. He served until November 1776, when his company was disbanded. After his militia service, Townsend relocated to Brattleboro, Vermont. Initially a supporter of New York's government in its ongoing dispute with local residents concerning jurisdiction over Vermont, Townsend later became a supporter of the Vermont government's claims. From 1781 to 1787 he was judge and register of probate for Windham County. From 1781 to 1788, Townsend served as Vermont's Secretary of State. After resigning his offices, Townsend continued to practice law in Brattleboro. In 1801, Townsend sold his Brattleboro home and land to Royall Tyler, and moved to Guilford. In 1802, he moved again, this time to Farnham, Quebec, Canada. He farmed and practiced law, and continued to reside in Farnham until 1816, when he moved to Clarenceville. In Clarenceville, Townsend resided with his son, the Reverend Micajah Townsend. Townsend died in Clarenceville on April 23, 1832. He was buried at Saint Georges Anglican Cemetery in Clarenceville. ==Family== In 1778, Townsend married Mary Wells (1760\u20131831). They were the parents of several children, including: Harriett Matilda Townsend (1779\u20131848); Epenetus Townsend (1783\u20131839); Rebecca Gale Townsend Hawley (1784\u20131830); and Micajah Townsend (1789\u20131871). ==References== ==Sources== ===Books=== * * Category:1749 births Category:1832 deaths Category:People from Oyster Bay (town), New York Category:Princeton University alumni Category:People from White Plains, New York Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:People of New York (state) in the American Revolution Category:People of pre-statehood Vermont Category:Vermont lawyers Category:People from Brattleboro, Vermont Category:Secretaries of State of Vermont Category:Vermont state court judges Category:Lawyers in Quebec Category:Burials in Quebec ",
