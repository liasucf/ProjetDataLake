The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. == Overview == Place-des-Arts station platform. Designed by David, Boulva, et Cleve, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two ticket halls joined by corridors that surround and overlook the platforms. The eastern mezzanine includes staircases with one-way exit-only turnstiles. The station is joined by underground city to Place des Arts and Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, and has additional four street-level exits. The station's walls are coved in light-blue bricks in a zig-zag layout. The station is equipped with the M\u00e9troVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time until the next train arrives. The station has 4 entrances: : 1555, rue Jeanne-Mance : 2020, rue de Bleury : 1990, rue de Bleury : 150, rue Ontario == Architecture and art == Stained glass mural entitled L'histoire de la musique \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (\"history of music in Montreal\"). The station features art by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Back: a massive stained glass mural entitled L'histoire de la musique \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (\"history of music in Montreal\"). The work is composed of thousands of layered pieces of glass backlit by 105 lighting tubes and supported by a tonne of steel. The glass surface is rippled, causing the brilliant colours to shimmer ethereally. The work was originally intended to be an homage to four important Quebec musical artists: the composers Calixa Lavall\u00e9e, Guillaume Couture, and Alexis Contant, and soprano Dame Emma Albani. Unveiled on December 20, 1967, this stained glass was the first work of art to be commissioned for the Metro system. In 2008 the lighting system was completely renovated by the lighting artist Axel Morgenthaler. The second work of art is a hand-glazed ceramic mosaic by the artist Saskia Siebrand, installed in 2005. It contains tiles of over 300 colours, all custom hand-glazed. This architectural composition made of perforated aluminum panels was added to conceal a telecommunications room that had been added over the station's western tunnel opening. Before this work was added, the Montr\u00e9al m\u00e9tro featured only one mosaic, the one by Gabriel Bastien and Andrea Vau at Sherbrooke station. ==Origin of the name== This station is named for the Place des Arts cultural complex. Opened in 1963, this complex includes five concert halls, including the largest multipurpose concert hall in Canada, and an art museum. ==Connecting bus routes== {| align=center class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background: #; font-size:100%; color:#FFFFFF;\"| |- !
