    "text": "The Casa de Cultura M\u00e1rio Quintana, in Porto Alegre downtown. M\u00e1rio de Miranda Quintana (July 30, 1906 \u2013 May 5, 1994) was a Brazilian writer and translator. He became known as the poet of \"simple things\", and his style is marked by irony, profundity and technical perfection. The main themes of his poetry include death, the lost childhood and time. Quintana also worked as a journalist and translated into Portuguese innumerable books, such as Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. ==Biography== The son of Celso de Oliveira Quintana de Miranda and Virginia, M\u00e1rio Quintana was born in Alegrete, where he received his early education. He moved to Porto Alegre in 1919 to study at the Military School, and there he published his first works. He started working for Editora Globo, while it was still a state-owned publishing house. Considered the \"poet of simple things\" with a style marked by irony, depth, and technical perfection, he worked as a journalist for most of his life. He translated over one hundred and thirty books of world literature, including in Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and Words and Blood, by Giovanni Papini.Susana Gon\u00e7alves, Markus A. Carpenter Diversity, Intercultural Encounters, and Education 2012 \u2013 Page 215 \"Obviously, poetry and art are the privileged territories for this game of reversibilities where the ambient opens up, as the Brazilian poet M\u00e1rio Quintana says, \"poetry is not a flight from reality, but a flight to reality.\" Only this flight \"to reality\" ... In 1940, he released his first book of poetry, The Windmills Street, beginning his career as a poet, writer and children's author. In 1953, Quintana worked at the newspaper Correio do Povo as a columnist of a subsection on culture, which was published every Saturday, and left the newspaper in 1977. In 1966, to commemorate his sixty years of age, he published \"Poetics Anthology\", with sixty poems, organized by Rubem Braga and Paulo Mendes Campos, and for this reason the poet was aclaimed by the Brazilian Academy of Letters by Meyer and Manuel Augusto Bandeira, who recited his own poem \"Quintanares\", in honor of his fellow gaucho. In the same year he won the Brazilian Union of Writer's Fernando Chinaglia Prize for best book of the year. In 1976, after turning seventy years old, Quintana was awarded from the state of Rio Grande do Sul government the Medal Negrinho do Pastoreio. In 1980, for his body of work, Quintana was awarded the Machado de Assis prize from the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Mario Quintana never married nor had children. Solitary, he lived most of his life in hotels: from 1968 to 1980 he resided at the Hotel Majestic, in the historic center of Porto Alegre, from where he was evicted when financial problems, due to the temporary closing of Correio do Povo, left him without pay. At the time, the sports commentator and former player of the Brazilian national soccer team Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o gave him a room at the Hotel Royal, of his property. To a friend who found the room too small, Quintana said, \"I live in myself. Never mind that the room is small. It's good, so I have fewer places to lose my stuff.\" The poet tried three times for a chair at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, but in none of the occasions he was elected, falling short of twenty votes required to qualify. Even with the promise of unanimimous approval, the poet refused to apply a fourth time. He died in Porto Alegre, aged 87. ==Works== * A Rua dos Cataventos, 1940 * Can\u00e7\u00f5es, 1946 * Sapato Florido, 1948 * O Aprendiz de Feiticeiro, 1950 * Espelho M\u00e1gico, 1951 * In\u00e9ditos e Esparsos, 1953 * Poesias, 1962 * Caderno H, 1973 * Apontamentos de Hist\u00f3ria Sobrenatural, 1976 * Quintanares, 1976 * A Vaca e o Hipogrifo, 1977 * Esconderijos do Tempo, 1980 * Ba\u00fa de Espantos, 1986 * Preparativos de Viagem, 1987 * Da Pregui\u00e7a como M\u00e9todo de Trabalho, 1987 * Porta Girat\u00f3ria, 1988 * A Cor do Invis\u00edvel, 1989 * Vel\u00f3rio Sem Defunto, 1990 * \u00c1gua, 2001 ==References== ==External links== * Mario Quintana \u2013 A Life in Poems < Eyes On Brazil > Category:1906 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Alegrete Category:Culture in Rio Grande do Sul Category:20th-century Brazilian poets Category:Brazilian male poets Category:Translators to Portuguese Category:20th-century translators Category:20th-century Brazilian male writers ",
