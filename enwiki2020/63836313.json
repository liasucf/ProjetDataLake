He worked in laboratories in Manaus, Brazil for two years, followed by thirteen years in Sierra Leone and then returned to England in 1937 and served as a professor until his retirement. Gordon developed methods for feeding vectors such as mosquitoes through a membrane; studied schistosomiasis, metazoan immunity, the use of screens for mosquitoes, feeding behaviour, filariasis, polymorphic trypanosomes, and a range of other subjects. He published more than a hundred research papers. He wrote a textbook on medical entomology along with M.M.Lavoipierre, which was posthumously published as Entomology for Students of Medicine (1962). He was awarded the Chalmers Medal in 1937, and an OBE in 1938.Edinburgh Gazette June 14, 1938:502. == References == Category:British pathologists Category:British parasitologists Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:1898 births Category:1961 deaths ",
