He specializes in research into domain engineering, requirements engineering and formal methods. He worked with Cliff Jones and others on the Vienna Development Method (VDM) at IBM Laboratory Vienna (and elsewhere). Later he was involved with producing the RAISE (Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering) formal method with tool support. Bj\u00f8rner was a professor at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) from 1965\u20131969 and 1976\u20132007, before he retired in March 2007. He was responsible for establishing the United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST), Macau, in 1992 and was its first director. His magnum opus on software engineering (three volumes) appeared in 2005/6.Bj\u00f8rner, Dines, Software Engineering, 3 volumes. Texts in Theoretical Computer Science, An EATCS Series, Springer-Verlag (2005\u20136). To support VDM, Bj\u00f8rner co-founded VDM-Europe, which subsequently became Formal Methods Europe, an organization that supports conferences and related activities. In 2003, he instigated the associated ForTIA Formal Techniques Industry Association. Bj\u00f8rner became a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1985. He received a Dr.h.c. from the Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic in 2004. He is a Fellow of the IEEE (2004) and ACM (2005). He has also been a member of the Academia Europaea since 1989. In 2007, a Symposium was held in Macau in honour of Dines Bj\u00f8rner and Zhou Chaochen.Cliff B.
