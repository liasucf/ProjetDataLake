This was passed by CIDCO on August 1, 2009. Despite getting environmental clearance from the Centre almost three years ago, the project was stuck due to protracted negotiations with farmers who wanted a compensation package of Rs 20 crore per hectare or 35 per cent of the land bank as a developed plot.

The new structure will encompass an area of 200 hectares factoring in the central park and golf course. The actual corporate hub will be on 125 hectares of land. Cidco has decided to have a layered structure with the outer fringe to be developed with 1-2 FSI while the core area will have 3 FSI. Around 50% of the area (120 hectares) has been set aside for the high rises with 3 FSI for the pyramid-shaped structure. Plots will be auctioned for corporates with the richer entities vying for the hub of the corporate park. Shops and commercial properties will also be developed so that there is night life unlike BKC. Proximity to the international airport and the metro project worth Rs 13,000 crore, will provide high class infra, Bhatia said. The entire Kharghar node along with nearby industrial Taloja will get connected to the new airport lending an opportunity for businesses to hop between work stations and the airport. ==Kharghar Hills Driving Range== In the vicinity of the Central Park there is Kharghar golf club. From the main road, a branch road is made around the 300 m periphery of the golf club and it terminates at the base of Kharghar hills. This small road is known as driving range. From here, there are pedestrian ways to climb on the hills around and enjoy the beauty of the landscapes. One can even go to the top most place in the hills around where there is a small village known as Chapewadi. The pedestrian path is not much easier there as one has to climb on steep slopes and requires help of a stick. It takes about 30-40 minutes time to reach up from where one can have a panoramic view of places around. Trekking is a popular activity here. Serious morning walkers come here for regular walks. During rainy season a lot of people from Kharghar and nearby areas visit here to enjoy the water falls and water in a river nearby. During summers these water falls and river dry up.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO5n0OdjiIYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfiLPJEtqgU ==References== * Category:Nodes of Navi Mumbai ",
