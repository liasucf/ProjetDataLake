Together with Stepas Butautas, Vytautas Kulakauskas, Justinas Lagunavi\u010dius and Kazys Petkevi\u010dius, he was considered as one of the finest Lithuanian basketball players during the first post-war decades. Sercevi\u010dius played for the center position and had the outstanding ability to shoot the hook shots with both hands, which earned him the nickname of \"The Second Lubinas\". However, his international career was impeded by his anti-Soviet political record. ==Biography== According to Antanas Kuzdys, Sercevi\u010dius was arrested because he refused to purposefully lose a basketball match to a team from Moscow in 1945. He was arrested and sent to mines in Vorkuta by the Soviets. Following his return to Lithuania, he was a candidate to the Soviet Union national basketball team for four straight years, including the team sent to EuroBasket 1947 where it won gold. His place was taken by another Lithuanian, Justinas Lagunavi\u010dius. He was not selected because was not allowed to leave the Soviet Bloc due to his arrest. As a student at Lithuanian National Institute of Physical Education (LVKKI), Sercevi\u010dius played for the institute's team. He was also a member of the Lithuania SSR men's national basketball team (1945\u201351), playing 11 matches and scoring 73 points. Upon graduation in 1951, he joined the legendary Lithuanian club \u017dalgiris. He coached \u017dalgiris in 1951 and 1953\u201355. During his career, Sercevi\u010dius won five Lithuanian and two Soviet championships. After retirement from active sport, he continued to teach at the Lithuanian National Institute of Physical Education until his retirement in 1984. In 1990s, during one of his interviews, he described his career by telling: \"My sporting period was beside Stalin and Brezhnev and we cannot consider that it went as it could went. <\u2026> Being young we had in mind that we represent Kaunas, the republic in the Soviet Union, we fought for our nation, ideas, we acquainted the people that there is such Pabaltijis, such cities. <\u2026> There was a stimulus that we fight for Lithuania and there were games when we reached victories during the crucial moments, however the satisfaction wasn\u2019t complete because we competed for the Lithuanian SSR. <\u2026> Personally, I haven't played till 1940. I was way too young and now I'm already too old\".Telecast \"M\u016bs\u0173 krep\u0161inis\" (Season: 1; Episode: 1; Quotation begins at 49:21) ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2003 deaths Category:BC \u017dalgiris players Category:Lithuanian basketball coaches Category:Lithuanian men's basketball players Category:Soviet basketball coaches Category:Soviet men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from K\u0117dainiai Category:People from K\u0117dainiai District Municipality Category:Gulag detainees Category:Centers (basketball) ",
