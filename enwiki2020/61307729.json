Tissa was appointed the viceroy (Oupahat) in 1826. In the next year, Anouvong revolted against Siamese. Tissa appointed as deputy commander-in- chief of Vientiane army. He led one of three Laotian armies to fight against Siamese. His army marched south to Kalasin, however, after some delay, he had to retreat because superior Siamese forces was coming. He was blamed for releasing a senior Siamese official, who later went to Bangkok and revealed the Laotian plan of campaign. On this basis he was falsely accused of treason. Tissa continued fighting against Siamese. He was captured by Siamese in Tha Sida on 19 July 1827. His three sons and a daughter accompanied Anouvong to Ngh\u1ec7 An in Vietnam. In the absence of Anouvong, Tissa was briefly appointed as ruler of Vientiane by Siamese on 28 July 1827. ==See also== *Lao rebellion (1826\u20131828) ==References== Category:Laotian royalty Category:Kingdom of Vientiane ",
