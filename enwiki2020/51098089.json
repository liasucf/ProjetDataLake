    "text": "Sonia Gomes (born 1948) is an Afro-Brazilian contemporary artist based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. She is known for her mixed media sculptures made of fabric, wires, and other objects that are either found or given to her. == Background == Sonia Gomes was born to a black mother and white father in Caetan\u00f3polis, a small town considered to be the birthplace of the textile industry in Brazil, in 1948. Gomes joined the art world relatively late, at around the age of 45, but claimed the creative process was a way to free her from her upbringing. == Work == Gomes uses fabric, threads, and objects that are either gifts or found to create multi-dimensional sculptures and structures. Much of her work has been described as autobiographical. Formative to her practice has been her childhood memories of her paternal family\u2019s Catholic customs and the rituals her maternal grandmother, a shaman, used to perform. Other influences include Brazilian dances and the history and culture of African diaspora in Brazil. Gomes often uses secondhand materials, purchased from thrift stores or donated by family; L\u00e1grima (Tear) (2014), for example, was made with a blue tablecloth that once belonged to her friend\u2019s family. ==Solo exhibitions== Pace Gallery, New York, 2020 Mendes Wood DM, Brussels, 2019 Lehmann Maupin Gallery, New York, NY, November 2014. ==Group exhibitions== *\"Art & Textiles: Fabric as Material and Concept in Modern Art from Klimt to the Present,\" at Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany, 2013 *\"Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947 \u2013 2016\", Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, Los Angeles, 2016 * \u201cHist\u00f3rias/Histories: Contemporary Art From Brazil\u201d, USF Contemporary Art Museum, Florida, USA, 2016 * \"No Man\u2019s Land: Women Artists From The Rubell Family Collection\u201d, Rubell Family Collection, Miami, EUA, 2015 * \u201cAll the World\u2019s Futures\u201d, 56 Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy, 2014 * \u201c19th Contemporary Art Festival Sesc_Video Brasil: Southern Panoramas\u201d, Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural Video Brasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2014 * \u201cThe Poetry in Between: South to South\u201d, Goodman Gallery, Cape Town, South Africa, 2014 ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian artists Category:Mixed-media artists ",
