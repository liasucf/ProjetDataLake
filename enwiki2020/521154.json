In preparation for her first deployment to the Mediterranean, the destroyer took part in amphibious exercises off Puerto Rico in July 1958, and arrived at Gibraltar on 10 August. She patrolled the eastern Mediterranean through the rest of the month, then sailed to join the 7th Fleet in its operations off Taiwan in support of the threatened islands of Quemoy and Matsu.

En route home in October, Forrest Sherman came to the aid of the Liberian freighter Allen Christensen who had a severely injured man on board.

When the company went bankrupt she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court. The ship was 'recovered' by the Navy and berthed in the Inactive Ship Facility at the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was eventually put on a list for donation for museum status. In 2006, Congress passed Pub.L. 109-163, the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, which authorized the transfer of Forrest Sherman to the USS Forrest Sherman DD-931 Foundation Inc, a group that planned on moving the ship to Indian River Inlet, Delaware to restore it as a museum.http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110131/NEWS/101310318/1006/Plan- would-bring-US-Navy-destroyer-to-Indian-River-Inlet These plans fell through and the ship was removed from donation hold in 2011. Volunteers from other museum ships were allowed to remove useful parts/equipment in June, 2011. The Forrest Sherman was finally sold for scrapping 15 December 2014, and was scrapped by the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services on 1 January 2016.http://www.dla.mil/News/tabid/12178/Article/639795/dla-disposition- services-scraps-decommissioned-ship.aspx ==Awards== *Navy Unit Citation *Navy Expeditionary Medal *National Defense Service Medal *Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with star == References == * * Category:Forrest Sherman- class destroyers Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States Category:1955 ships Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine ",
