At the Battle of Leuthen, he rallied his cavalry against the onslaught of the Prussian oblique maneuver. Luccesi had been promoted 25 March 1741 to Generalfeldwachtmeister (master general of field guards). This is an obsolete rank, above colonel, which was superseded by the rank of major general.Josef Wuk, Technisches polyglott- onomasticum: Oder W\u00f6rterbuch in sieben ... 1864. p. 150, entry: \"Generalfeldwachmeister, V.
