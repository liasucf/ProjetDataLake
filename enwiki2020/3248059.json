Among his best results are a European Championships bronze medal from 1938 and an Olympic Games bronze from 1948. V\u00e1rszegi won the Hungarian national championships a record 20 times between 1932 and 1952 and also broke the Hungarian national record six times during his career. ==Career== V\u00e1rszegi was born in Gy\u0151r and began to do athletics in local clubs Dun\u00e1nt\u00fali AC and Gy\u0151ri AC. An all-around athlete in his youth, he competed both in running and throwing events, achieving his best results in javelin throw. In 1930 he won the national high school championships with a competition record of 52.22 metres. Later he went to study on the University of Physical Education in Budapest. His first major results came at International University Games, winning the javelin throw event in 1933 and finishing second in 1937. In addition he earned a sixth place in 1935. He also won the unofficial, German- led 1939 International University Games. He participated at his first European Championships in 1934, coming fifth with a distance of 65.81 metres. Four years later he finished third in the same event thanks to throw of 72.78 metres, with that he set a new national record which was broken only 17 years later. In 1936 V\u00e1rszegi was present at the Olympic Games, where although he came through the qualifying round with the best result (69.7 meters), he did not manage to go anywhere near that distance in the final and eventually finished eighth. In the next decade due to the World War II there were no other major events held, however, the Hungarian Athletics Championships were not interrupted and took place in every year. V\u00e1rszegi, who was unbeatable since 1932, extended his run during this period and won a total of 20 national titles until 1952, making him the most successful javelin thrower in the competition history. V\u00e1rszegi did not participate at the 1946 European Championships, however, in the next year he competed at International University Games and won the gold medal for the second time after his success in 1933. The best achievement of V\u00e1rszegi's career came in 1948, when at the Olympic Games in London he won the bronze medal in the javelin throw. His last major event was the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki at the age of 41. V\u00e1rszegi failed to advance to the final round after he could not hit the qualifying limit of 64 metres and finished 23rd overall. After retirement from professional sport, V\u00e1rszegi became a coach and worked for Vasas SC and Budapest Honv\u00e9d SE. He died in Budapest in 1977. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Gy\u0151r Category:Hungarian male javelin throwers Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
