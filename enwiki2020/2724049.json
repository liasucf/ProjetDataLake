It co-stars Charles Grodin, Gilda Radner, Joseph Bologna, Judith Ivey and Kelly LeBrock. The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", written and performed by Stevie Wonder. ==Plot== San Francisco ad man Teddy Pierce is amused by, then obsessed with, a beautiful woman whose red dress goes billowing over her head by a gust of wind from crossing over a ventilation grate, and exposing her red satin string bikini panties. Teddy is happily married to Didi, but he cannot get this woman out of his mind. Encouraged by his friends Buddy, Joe, and Michael, he tries to ask her for a date but mistakenly phones Ms. Milner, a plain ad-agency employee who is flattered by his interest. Teddy ultimately does become acquainted with the woman in red, a British model named Charlotte, going horseback riding with her and even inviting her out on what is supposed to be a date but turns out to be a party with his relatives. He radically alters his wardrobe and begins using elaborate ruses to see Charlotte socially. Meanwhile, he incurs the wrath of Ms. Milner, whom he stood up before. Events come to a head in Charlotte's high-rise apartment, where she invites Teddy into her satin bed. He is thrilled until her airline pilot husband suddenly comes home. Trying to escape, Teddy ends up on a ledge, where passersby below believe he is about to commit suicide, all captured on live television. Didi, while watching this on live television, tears up as she believes Teddy is doing this because of her own cheating. He jumps off the window ledge and waits to be caught by the firemen. While falling, Teddy starts to become interested in a newswoman who smiles at him. ==Cast== * Gene Wilder as Theodore Pierce * Kelly LeBrock as Charlotte, the Woman in Red * Gilda Radner as Ms. Milner * Charles Grodin as Buddy * Joseph Bologna as Joe * Judith Ivey as Didi Pierce * Michael Zorek as Shelly * Michael Huddleston as Michael * Arthur Bailey as Jocko * Kyra Stempel as Missy Pierce * Robin Ignico as Becky Pierce * Viola Kates Stimpson as Mama Dell ==Production== ===Background=== The film is a remake of An Elephant Can Be Extremely Deceptive, also known as Pardon Mon Affaire, directed by Yves Robert and written by Jean-Loup Dabadie and Yves Robert. ===Filming=== The Woman in Red was shot in the fall of 1983. ===Music=== The Original motion picture soundtrack was composed by Stevie Wonder, except \"It's More Than You\" by Ben Bridges and features performances by Wonder and also Dionne Warwick.
