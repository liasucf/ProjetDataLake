    "text": "Hawthorn railway station is located on the Lilydale, Belgrave and Alamein lines in Victoria, Australia. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, opening on 13 April 1861.Hawthorn Vicsig ==History== Originally, Hawthorn was a terminus, with a single platform (the current day Platform 1). In 1882, an additional platform was constructed, after the line was extended to Camberwell. In 1890, an island platform was constructed, using a canopy from the original Flinders Street station, for the newly opened, and now closed, branch line to Kew. A third track was added between Hawthorn and Burnley in 1972, which allows the centre track to be used as a bi-directional track for express services during peak hour, and completed triplication of the line as far as Box Hill. Bulk briquette handling facilities were abolished at the station in 1973. By the mid 1980s, the station was in a dilapidated state, and had not been maintained for many years. In 1984, the State Government, with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (The Met), approved a $300,000 face- lift of the station. The face-lift included a repaint of the station, the re- panelling of the waiting room, re-cladding of the canopies and landscaping. The works were completed by May 1986. The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. ==Platforms and services== Hawthorn has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains' Lilydale, Belgrave and Alamein line services.
