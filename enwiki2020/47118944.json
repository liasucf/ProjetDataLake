    "text": "Franklin County Speedway is a three-eighths mile asphalt race track located in Callaway, Virginia. With 22 degrees of banking in the turns, FCS is marketed as the \"fastest 3/8ths of a mile paved oval in the world\" by the track's management. The track was built in 1969 by Callaway resident Wilton Agee, proprietor of a gas station and community store. \"We did everything with speed in mind,\" said Agee. \"We wanted the fastest track possible.\" Originally a dirt track, Agee decided to pave it when workers had trouble keeping turns one and two tightly packed during race events. A total of 103 teams showed up for the track's first event with a paved surface. After nearly eight seasons of \"making a little money one week and losing it the next,\" Agee sold the track to Roanoke VA resident Bill \"Squeek\" McGuire. McGuire's tenure as owner lasted just under two seasons before he sold it to Donald \"Whitey\" Taylor, a local racer. The track's 50th Anniversary Season in 2018 will be Taylor's 40th year as FCS owner. The track is a steeply banked 3/8ths of a mile asphalt oval with a permanent concrete seating concourse that has a capacity of 8,200. The corner embankments are 22 degrees and the straightaways are 50 feet wide, making the track conducive to exciting racing. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Franklin County, Virginia Category:Motorsport venues in Virginia Category:Tourist attractions in Franklin County, Virginia ",
