    "text": "A global union federation is an international federation of national trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups. Previously, a GUF was referred to as an international trade secretariat (ITS).. Many unions are members of one or more global union federations, relevant to the sectors where they have their members. Individual unions may also be affiliated to a national trade union center, which in turn can be affiliated to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) or the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). == Current federations == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Federation !Acronym !Headquarters !Present ! |- |Building and Wood Workers' International |BWI |Geneva |2005 |. |- |Education International |EI |Brussels |1992 |. |- |IndustriALL Global Union |IndustriAll |Geneva |2012 | |- |International Arts and Entertainment Alliance |IAEA |Brussels |1997 | |- |International Federation of Actors |FIA |Brussels |1952 | |- |International Federation of Journalists |IFJ |Brussels |1926 | |- |International Federation of Musicians |FIM |Paris |1948 | |- |International Transport Workers' Federation |ITF |London |1896 | |- |International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations |IUF |Geneva |1920 | |- |Public Services International |PSI |Ferney-Voltaire |1907 | |- |UNI Global Union |UNI |Nyon |2000 | |} == Former secretariats == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
