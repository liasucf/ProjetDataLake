    "text": "Emperor Huizong (1060\u20131086), born Li Bingchang \u674e\u79c9\u5e38, was the 3rd emperor of the Western Xia (reigned 1067\u20131086). After his father's sudden death, Huizong assumed the throne at the young age of six. His mother, Empress Dowager Liang (\u6881\u592a\u540e), became the regent for the rest of Huizong's reign. In 1076, Huizong turned sixteen, and was supposed to assume direct control of the throne, but was stopped by the enormous influence of the Dowager. The two sparred over the cultural policy of the empire: Emperor Huizong supported sinicization, while Empress Dowager Liang supported Tangutization (ironic, considering Huizong is of Tangut heritage, and Liang is of Han Chinese heritage). Empress Dowager Liang eventually had Huizong put under house arrest; as a result, Huizong requested Song for help. Song invaded Western Xia on the premise of freeing Huizong, but the invasion was repelled. Empress Dowager Liang then forced Huizong to marry her niece, who would also become a powerful empress dowager. Thus, Western Xia had two different Empress Dowager Liang. He was depressed by the control of his mother, and Huizong later died at the young age of 26. Huizong was succeeded by Emperor Chongzong of Western Xia. ==References== Category:1060 births Category:1086 deaths Category:Western Xia emperors Category:11th-century Chinese monarchs ",
