Having upright, waxy, terete leaves, the plant is only found on a few acres of the Colonet Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. This thin, stalky plant grows to about tall, and has bright pink and white flowers. Dudleya hendrixii is summer deciduous, dying in the summer only to re-sprout in the fall. The plant\u2019s name translates directly to \"Hendrix\u2019s liveforever,\" as Mark Dodero, the former graduate student from SDSU who is credited with discovering the plant, was listening to Hendrix\u2019s \"Voodoo Child\" at the moment he found the plant. Because of its small habitat, the plant under threat of extinction from grazing and development. ==References== hendrixii ",
