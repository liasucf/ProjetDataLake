They were disciplined by their union under its rules, prompted by Mr Scargill who chaired the disciplinary panel. They were found in breach and disqualified from office for two years. ==Judgment== Templeman J held that the disciplinaries were unlawful. He noted that \u2018all members of a domestic tribunal where the interests of their own organisation are at stake, have a general inclination to defend the union and its officers against attack from any source.\u2019 Scargill\u2019s role as chairman \u2018undoubtedly gave the impression that the dice were loaded against... the appearance of bias was inevitable.\u2019 The question is \u2018whether a reasonable man with no inside knowledge might well think that it might be biased.Hannam v Bradford Corporation [1970] 1 WLR 937, 979 Here it was obvious. ==See also== *UK labour law ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom labour case law ",
