    "text": "Shooting to wound refers to attempts to use a firearm to harm someone without killing them. It is controversial, since the unpredictable nature of firearm wounds could result in the wound failing to incapacitate, accidentally killing or missing the target, the latter of which presents a risk of unintended casualties. Limbs are one main area often targeted when shooting to wound. However, limbs are smaller and can be moved faster and more radically than the torso, so the option of shooting to wound is generally viewed with skepticism by law enforcement in the United States. ==See also== * Warning shot ==References== Category:Firearms ",
