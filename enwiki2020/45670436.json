This formation is found in the Amazonis quadrangle and near the equator.SAO/NASA ADS Astronomy Abstract Service: Yardangs on Mars, Journal of Geophysical Research Vol. 84, Issue B14, 30 December 1979. https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB14p08147 They are formed by the action of wind on sand sized particles; hence they often point in the prevailing direction that the winds were blowing when they were formed.Yardangs on Mars, ESA Mars Express, 23 Jul 2004 ESA High-resolution image, Yardangs on Mars near Olympus Mons on Mars, image taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board the ESA Mars Express spacecraft. Because they exhibit very few impact craters they are believed to be relatively young. THEMIS image of Medusae Fossae Formation, ASU, 2002-04-16 The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Yardangs are parts of rock that have been sand blasted into long, skinny ridges by bouncing sand particles blowing in the wind.Yardangs in Arsinoes Chaos University of Arizona HiRISE Operations, 04 January 2015http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039563_1730 Layers are seen in parts of the formation. A resistant caprock on the top of yardangs has been observed in Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and HiRISE photos. Images from spacecraft show that they have different degrees of hardness probably because of significant variations in the physical properties, composition, particle size, and/or cementation.
