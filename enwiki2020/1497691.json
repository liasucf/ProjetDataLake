Produced by Red Production Company for BBC Wales in association with Granada Television, the 3-episode series was first screened on digital television station BBC Three from 13 March, with a repeat on mainstream analogue network BBC One commencing 4 April. ==Synopsis== Telling the story of the life of 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova, based on his own twelve-volume memoirs, the one-hour episodes star Peter O'Toole as the older Casanova looking back on his life and David Tennant as the younger version. Rose Byrne, Rupert Penry-Jones, Matt Lucas, Shaun Parkes, Nina Sosanya and Laura Fraser are also featured. ==Cast== * David Tennant as Giacomo Casanova ** John Sandilands as 5-year-old Giacomo Casanova ** Zachary Fox as 11-year-old Giacomo Casanova * Peter O'Toole as Old Giacomo Casanova * Tom Burke as 20-year-old Giac Casanova ** James Holly as 6-year-old Giac Casanova ** Brock Everitt Elwick as 11-year-old Giac Casanova * Laura Fraser as Henriette * Rupert Penry-Jones as Grimani * Nina Sosanya as Bellino * Shaun Parkes as Rocco * Rose Byrne as Edith * Freddie Jones as Bragadin Comedians Matt Lucas, Mark Heap, Simon Day and Matthew Holness make cameo appearances. ==Episodes== ==Production== The series was originally commissioned from Davies by Executive Producer Julie Gardner when she was working at Granada-owned London Weekend Television. However, after Gardner moved on to become Head of Drama at BBC Wales in 2003, she commissioned Davies to write the drama for the BBC instead, as part of the deal that also saw him installed as the chief writer and Executive Producer of Doctor Who (in which Tennant later played the Doctor's tenth incarnation), also being overseen by Gardner and made at BBC Wales. It was Tennant's role as Giacomo that led to Davies casting him in Doctor Who as the Tenth Doctor. It was aired in the United States in two parts, 8 and 15 October 2006, with the full unedited British version released on DVD the following week, 17 October 2006. The programme also aired in Australia on the ABC, again edited into two parts. ==Home release== The serial was released on DVD in the UK in May 2005, and in the United States in October 2006. ==References== ==External links== *Casanova at the Red Production Company website. *Casanova at the Masterpiece Theatre website. * * * Category:2000s British drama television series Category:2005 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings Category:BBC television dramas Category:2000s British television miniseries Category:BBC Cymru Wales television shows Category:Cultural depictions of Giacomo Casanova Category:Television shows written by Russell T Davies Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series created by Russell T Davies Category:Nonlinear narrative television series ",
