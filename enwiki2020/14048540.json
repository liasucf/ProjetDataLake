    "text": "Kelvin Robin \"Kel\" Tremain (21 February 1938 \u2013 2 May 1992) was a New Zealand rugby union player and administrator. A flanker, he won 38 full caps for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, between 1959 and 1968, scoring nine tries. During the 1960s he had a status in New Zealand rugby comparable to that of his teammate, Colin Meads. ==Biography== Born in Auckland on 21 February 1938, Tremain was educated at Auckland Grammar School, where he played in the 1st XV rugby team in 1954 and 1955. After leaving school, he became an agricultural field cadet, which took him all over the country, including stints studying at Massey and Canterbury Agricultural Colleges. As a result, he played for five different provincial teams: , , , , and . It was with the latter team that he made the greatest contribution, appearing in 96 games between 1962 and 1970, and becoming team captain. Tremain made two appearances for the South Island and seven for the North Island in interisland matches, and was captain of the New Zealand Universities side that toured North America in 1961. He made his All Blacks debut in 1959, playing in three tests against the touring British and Irish Lions. After touring with the New Zealand team to Australia and South Africa in 1960, Tremain was generally regarded as an automatic selection for the team, and he gained a status alongside his contemporary, Colin Meads, as one of the greats of New Zealand rugby. He continued playing for New Zealand until 1968, captaining the side in three matches in his final year. He was controversially omitted from the team in 1969. In all, Tremain played 86 matches for the All Blacks\u201438 of them full internationals\u2014and scored 108 points (36 tries), including nine Test tries.
