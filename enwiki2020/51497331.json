    "text": "Dunnamona is a motte-and-bailey and National Monument in County Westmeath, Ireland. ==Location== Dunnamona motte is located next to a tributary of the Owenacharra River, east of Tubberclare. ==History and archaeology== Motte-and- bailey castles were a primitive type of castle built by the Norman invasion, a mound of earth topped by a wooden palisade. This region, known as Tethbae, was allotted to the Dillon family, descendants of Sir Henry de Leon (c. 1176 \u2013 1244). They built the motte at Dunnamona (\"hillfort of peat\") as well as another at Drumraney, later abandoning the mottes for permanent stone castles. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in County Westmeath Category:National Monuments in County Westmeath ",
