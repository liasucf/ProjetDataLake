    "text": "Josef Vacke (18 July 1907 \u2013 18 December 1987), born Josef Watzke, was a Czech artist and painter. Writer Vladimir Watzke and painter Josef Vacek were brothers. Both were the children of Karel Watzke and Anna Zyka (\"Zyka\" was a pseudonym that Vladimir used as his most common pseudonym). They had 3 children; Vladimir Watzke was born in 1900, Karel Watzke was born in 1902 and Josef Watzke (Vacke) was born in 1907. Vladimir Watzke was a very prolific writer of Czech fiction books, primarily fantasy and science fiction, who was highly popular in his time (thirties and forties). == Biography == Josef Vacke was born during the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a family that identified as Czech, but was of German extraction on the paternal side. His parents changed the spelling of the family name from the German orthography \"Watzke\" to the Czech orthography \"Vacke\" (identically pronounced), as an open expression of Czech patriotism. For several years, he taught painting at the Ebert school, where he led the painter Anton\u00edn Porket. Between 1923 and 1924 he studied at a private school at Ferdinand Engelm\u00fcler, and from 1925\u20131931 at the Academy of Fine Arts in the Landscape special show of Professor Otakar Nejedl\u00fd in Prague. His first study tour was undertaken in 1925 in Cagnes-sur- Mer, and then another trip to Cap d'Agnes (1926), Corsica (1928), and Ponte du Suve at Toulon (1930). To this can be added the Nejedly school stay, in J\u00edlov\u00e9 nad Sazavou to Mala Skala with Turnova on deep, at Rough Rock in Vlastislav in Central . In 1928 Vacke received a scholarship to travel to Paris, under the renowned professor Anton\u00edna Mat\u011bj\u00ed\u010dka . In 1931 and 1935 Vacke painted with Lucie Klimova in Yugoslavia. He also stayed in Zd\u011bchov, where his benefactor for his painting, was Ludv\u00edk Kl\u00edmek for whom he painted in 1943 in Zd\u011bchov four watercolors . During World War II, he often stayed on the S\u00e1zava and in the Highlands. After 1946, when gaining a cottage No. 91, Krizan , there are increasingly appearing in his works paintings of Podje\u0161t\u011bd\u00ed . Lucie Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 since 1946, moved to K\u0159i\u017eany, where she spent months in a cottage with Vacek. When Lucie Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 died in 1961, his partner was Bo\u017eenka \u0160kodov\u00e1. Josef Vacke often stayed and painted also at Velenicic\u00edch on Podebradska , whence came his mate Bo\u017eenka \u0160kodov\u00e1. From 1935 he was a member of the Club of Visual Artists \"Ale\u0161\" . He most often painted landscapes and flowers, including bouquets . Occasionally, one sees in his paintings, figurative motifs. == Selected works == * 1925: Nezabudice * 1926: Evening at the Cap d'Antibes * 1927: In Polabi ( Brandys nad Labem ); Harvest in Nezabudice * 1931: Korcula; Orebi\u0107; Pine forest at Rab (in Yugoslavia) * 1933: Summer Landscape ( Nezabudice ); Autumn in \u0160\u00e1rce * 1937: Window; Czech \u0160ternberk * 1938: Podesta ( Nezabudice ); Field near the village ( Nezabudice ); Still Life with Melon; Harvest in Nezabudice * 1939: The Virgin Mary at Nezabudice; Rusava; Stra\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1 peripherals * 1940: K\u0159i\u017eany * 1943: Zd\u011bchov (3 watercolors) * 1943: Corpus Christi in Zd\u011bchov * 1952: Parties in K\u0159i\u017eany * 1954: Harvest in Podje\u0161t\u011bd\u00ed * 1956: Journey kn\u00e1dra\u017ei ( K\u0159i\u017eany ); The cottages ( K\u0159i\u017eany ) * 1958: Lucie Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 at the cottage ( K\u0159i\u017eany ) == Exhibitions == === Overview exhibitions === * 1936: Prague gallery Blue Salon (together with Vaclav Trefil) * 1938: Prague gallery Topic Salon \u2013 Paintings of Nezabudice * 1941: Stone Ferry (together with Lucie Klimova) * 1942: Rakovn\u00edk K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t (retrospective exhibition of paintings and Nezabudice routes) * 1958: Prague, Purkyn\u011b gallery (paintings from the years 1931\u20131957) * 1967: Castle Ka\u010dina in Kutna Hora (together with Franz Proseck\u00fd) * 1968: Ohrada with Deep (collected exhibition Pictures from Podjestedi) * 1977, Prague, New Hall Gallery (paintings from the years 1928\u20131976) * 1978: Prerov, gallery Work * 1978: Kl\u00e1\u0161terec nad Ohri, Culture House Gallery (paintings from the years 1930\u20131977) * 1981: Kladno * 1983: Prague, Gallery U Recickych (selection of paintings from years 1925\u20131982) * 1985: Mut\u011bjovice, in cooperation with Rabasova gallery * 1987: Rakovn\u00edk, Rabasova gallery === Posthumous exhibition === * 2003: Prague gallery Peithner * 2011: Velenice , Pod\u011bbradsk\u00fdV\u00fdstava ve Velenic\u00edch * 2011: Rakovn\u00edk, Rabasova galleryKrajiny Vackeho jsou b\u00e1sn\u011bmi == Publications == * BARUCH, Joey; SOLAR, Josef : Fourteen new book marks of Jo\u017eko Baruch (= Collection Exlibris .
