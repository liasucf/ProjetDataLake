    "text": "Damayanthi Dharsha-Kobalavithanage (born 13 February 1975) is a retired Sri Lankan athlete who competed in the 200 and 400 metres race. Dharsha made an initial impact at just 16 years when she won the 100 metres gold medal at the Colombo SAF Games in 1991 with a new record. She broke into the limelight by winning the 100 metre gold at the Asian Junior Championships the same year. In 1994, she won the bronze in the 200 metres behind Chinese Taipei\u2019s Wang Huei- Chen and teammate Susanthika Jayasinghe at the Asian Games in Hiroshima. That was the beginning of a dominant period for Sri Lanka in women\u2019s sprinting with Jayasinghe and Darsha seriously challenging the Chinese. In July 2007, Dharsha announced her retirement from athletic competition. ==International competitions== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=2|1992 |rowspan=2|Olympic Games |rowspan=2|Barcelona, Spain |38th (h) |100 m |11.88 |- |29th (qf) |200 m |23.89 |- |1993 |Asian Championships |Manila, Philippines |bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd |200 m |23.29 |- |1994 |Asian Games |Hiroshima, Japan |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |200 m |23.61 |- |rowspan=2|1995 |rowspan=2|World Championships |rowspan=2|Edmonton, Canada |38th (h) |100 m |11.65 |- |28th (qf) |200 m |23.45 |- |1997 |World Championships |Athens, Greece |22nd (qf) |400 m |53.49 |- |rowspan=5|1998 |Asian Championships |Fukuoka, Japan |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |400 m |51.23 |- |Commonwealth Games |Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |4th |400 m |51.06 |- |rowspan=3|Asian Games |rowspan=3|Bangkok, Thailand |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |200 m |22.48 |- |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |400 m |51.57 |- |6th |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:40.05 |- |rowspan=2|1999 |rowspan=2|World Championships |rowspan=2|Seville, Spain |37th (h) |200 m |23.57 |- |31st (qf) |200 m |53.33 |- |rowspan=3|2000 |rowspan=2|Asian Championships |rowspan=2|Jakarta, Indonesia |bgcolor=gold|1st |200 m |22.84 |- |bgcolor=gold|1st |400 m |51.05 |- |Olympic Games |Sydney, Australia |23rd (qf) |400 m |52.35 |- |rowspan=5|2001 |rowspan=2|World Indoor Championships |rowspan=2|Lisbon, Portugal |12th (sf) |200 m |24.00 |- | \u2013 |400 m |DNF |- |rowspan=3|World Championships |rowspan=3|Edmonton, Canada |10th (sf) |200 m |22.88 |- |19th (sf) |400 m |51.83 |- |8th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |43.89 |- |rowspan=5|2002 |rowspan=3|Commonwealth Games |rowspan=3|Manchester, United Kingdom |14th (sf) |200 m |24.18 |- |22nd (sf) |400 m |53.91 |- |6th (f) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |44.25 |- |Asian Championships |Colombo, Sri Lanka |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:42.71 |- |Asian Games |Busan, South Korea |bgcolor=gold|1st |400 m |51.13 |- |rowspan=2|2003 |World Indoor Championships |Birmingham, United Kingdom |24th (h) |400 m |54.61 |- |Asian Championships |Manila, Philippines |3rd (h) |200 m |24.13Did not start in the final. |- |2004 |Olympic Games |Athens, Greece |38th (h) |400 m |54.58 |- |2005 |Asian Championships |Incheon, South Korea |bgcolor=gold|1st |200 m |23.21 |- |2006 |Commonwealth Games |Melbourne, Australia |16th (sf) |200 m |24.22 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Sri Lankan female sprinters Category:Olympic athletes of Sri Lanka Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games gold medalists for Sri Lanka Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Sri Lanka Category:Asian Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Sri Lanka Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Sri Lanka Category:Medalists at the 1994 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games ",
