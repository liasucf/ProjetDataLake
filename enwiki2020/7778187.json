    "text": "Regional development is a broad term but can be seen as a general effort to reduce regional disparities by supporting (employment and wealth-generating) economic activities in regions. In the past, regional development policy tended to try to achieve these objectives by means of large-scale infrastructure development and by attracting inward investment (OECD,2020). A large number of international organizations such as the OECD, UN, IMF and many more that provide assistance on economic, environmental and social issues to the less economically developed regions. Regional development can be national or international in nature. Therefore, the implications and scope of regional development may vary according to the definition of a region and how the region and its boundaries are perceived internally and externally. ==By country== ===Canada === * Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency * Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec * Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario * Western Economic Diversification Canada ===Malaysia=== * Central Terengganu Development Authority, or Lembaga Kemajuan Terengganu Tengah (KETENGAH) \u2013 official website * Kedah Regional Development Authority, or Lembaga Kemajuan Wilayah Kedah (KEDA) \u2013 official website * South East Johore Development Authority, or Lembaga Kemajuan Johor Tenggara (KEJORA) \u2013 official website * South Kelantan Development Authority, or Lembaga Kemajuan Kelantan Selatan (KESEDAR) \u2013 official website ===Nigeria=== * AREWA Center for Regional Development (ACRD) \u2013 official website ===United Kingdom=== * Regional development agency ===United States=== * Tennessee Valley Authority == Research Projects == * DEMOLOGOS * URSPIC == See also == * Aid * Development aid * International development * Regional science * Regional Studies Association * The Globalized City == Regional Development organizations == * OECD What is Regional Development? * ACRD Nigeria \u2013 AREWA Center for Regional Development * European Inforegio Commission's Regional Policy Information * IEDC Indiana Economic Development Corporation * OECD Regional Competitiveness and Governance Division * SWIEDC Southwest Indiana Economic Development Coalition * UNCRD United Nations Centre for Regional Development ==References== ==External links== * OECD What is Regional Development? * UNCRD United Nations Centre for Regional Development * Enfoques Te\u00f3ricos sobre el Desarrollo Regional * AREWA Center for Regional Development Category:Regional geography Development Z ",
