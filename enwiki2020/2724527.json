    "text": "Lance Reddick (born December 31, 1962) is an American actor and musician. He is best known for playing Cedric Daniels in The Wire and Phillip Broyles in Fringe. He is also known for portraying Detective Johnny Basil on Oz, Matthew Abaddon in Lost and Charon from the John Wick franchise. He has provided the voice and likeness for video game characters Martin Hatch in Quantum Break, Sylens in Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, and Commander Zavala in the Destiny franchise. He currently plays Chief Irvin Irving on Amazon Prime's Bosch. ==Early life== Reddick was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Dorothy Gee and Solomon Reddick. He attended Friends School of Baltimore. As a teenager, he studied music at the Peabody Preparatory Institute and a summer program teaching music theory and composition at the Walden School. After attending the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980s and enrolled in the Yale School of Drama in 1991. ==Career== Reddick was cast as Cedric Daniels in the HBO series The Wire, after having also auditioned for the roles of Bubbles and Bunk Moreland. He joined ABC's hit series Lost in 2008, where he played Matthew Abaddon, an employee of Charles Widmore, in multiple episodes. He was the third of five actors from the HBO hit series Oz to star in the drama. Producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse have said they were interested in Reddick for the part of Mr. Eko, but he was unavailable due to filming The Wire so they approached Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje instead. Reddick released his debut album Contemplations & Remembrances in 2007 and in early 2008, he was cast in a key role for the pilot of Fringe in which fellow Oz actor Kirk Acevedo also had a regular role. Reddick played Phillip Broyles, the head of an FBI department investigating paranormal activities. Reddick described the hard-driving character as \"a real hard-ass, but he's also one of the good guys.\" Like Lost, Fringe is co-created and produced by J. J. Abrams. There was some doubt about whether Reddick could appear in both Lost and Fringe in the 20082009 television season. However, Abrams stated that though Reddick was a series regular on Fringe, he would do episodes of Lost whenever required. Reddick appeared in the 2013 thriller White House Down. He stars in the YouTube web series DR0NE, of which he is a co-producer. In 2014, Reddick appeared as Charon in the action thriller film John Wick, a role he has reprised in its two sequels. He voiced the character Commander Zavala in the 2014 video game Destiny. Also in 2014, he started portraying the role of Chief Irvin Irving in the Amazon Prime series Bosch. Comparing his three large roles as police commanders, Reddick stated Daniels, his character from The Wire, was \"a cop at heart\". Broyles, his Fringe character, was \"a soldier\", while Irving \"is the quintessential politician\". In 2016, Reddick was cast in the post- apocalyptic horror film The Domestics. The film was released on June 28, 2018. He also voiced the character Sylens in the 2017 video game Horizon Zero Dawn. He is set to reprise his role in the upcoming sequel Horizon Forbidden West. In 2018, Reddick was cast in the upcoming film Godzilla vs. Kong. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |-law and order coronor ! Year !! Title !! Role !!
