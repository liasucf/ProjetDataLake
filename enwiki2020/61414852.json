He made them especially during his time in Krumau (today: \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov), where his mother Marie was born. The picturesque historic town (Altstadt) on both banks of the Moldau is now a UNESCO world heritage site. Schiele lived there with his partner and later wife in May to December 1910, and in May and June 1911. He had to leave because of his relationship to Wally, and due to reports about painting young nude models. He returned for short visits, then staying in guest houses.Renata Hrabalov\u00e1: Egon Schiele und Krumau, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice 2014 He completed, signed and dated D\u00e4mmernde Stadt in 1913.
