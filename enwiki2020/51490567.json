She served as a prominent role model for women. She dedicated her career to serving those in need. She is most known for her roles of leadership in her service work, highlighted by her role as a chairman of the Commission on the Status of Women in 1961. She used her career as an attorney and journalist to help solve issues with poverty and women's rights. == Early childhood and education == Margaret A. Hickey was born on March 14, 1902 in Kansas City, Missouri to Elizabeth Wynne and Charles Hickey. Charles Hickey, who lived in Paris, France at the time, served on the Foreign Service as a U.S. diplomat in Europe and the Ottoman Empire until World War I. The family bounced around several outposts in the Ottoman Empire prior to the war. Her family was forced to move back to the United States in 1914 due to World War I. After making that transition, Elizabeth Wynne worked in favor of the suffrage movement in Kansas City, which she included her children on as well. As a young girl, she made banners for suffragist parades. This exposure helped Margaret Hickey develop her interest in fighting for women's rights. When Margaret was in her late teens she actively worked for the peace movement in regards to World War I. In 1921, Hickey dropped out of college so she could work for the Kansas City Star as a reporter. She began working with influential business women involved in the National Federation of Business and Professional Women. Hickey, 20 years old at the time, was fascinated by these prominent women and this led her to enroll in the University of Kansas City Law School. There she pledged Kappa Beta Phi, a legal sorority for women. She received LLB degree from Kansas City University Law School (later University of Missouri) in 1928. == Career == After graduating from law school, Margaret Hickey declined offers from multiple firms in Kansas City and St. Louis to open up her own office as a private practice.

This committee dealt with issues involved in recruiting women into the wartime economy. In this position, she was given the opportunity to travel the country and speaking to audiences. She argued that women needed more college seats in order to progress. Her message to women was that in order for there to be meaningful change, women must leave the kitchen and enter the factory.
