Lal Bihari overcame the handicap of being dead, and managed to obtain a passport from the Indian government so that he could travel to Harvard to accept his Prize. However, the U.S. government refused to allow him into the country. His friend Madhu Kapoor therefore came to the Ig Nobel Ceremony and accepted the Prize on behalf of Lal Bihari. Several weeks later, the Prize was presented to Lal Bihari himself in a special ceremony in India. * Physics \u2013 Presented to Jack Harvey, John Culvenor, Warren Payne, Steve Cowle, Michael Lawrance, David Stuart, and Robyn Williams of Australia, for their irresistible report \"An analysis of the forces required to drag sheep over various surfaces\". * Psychology \u2013 Presented to Gian Vittorio Caprara and Claudio Barbaranelli of the University of Rome La Sapienza, and to Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University, for their discerning report \"Politicians' Uniquely Simple Personalities\". ==2004== The ceremony took place on 30 September 2004. * Biology \u2013 Presented to Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia, Lawrence Dill of Simon Fraser University, Canada, Robert Batty of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, Magnus Wahlberg of the University of Aarhus, Denmark, and H\u00e5kan Westerberg of Sweden's National Board of Fisheries, for showing that herrings apparently communicate by farting. :It has been suggested that the study of this phenomenon has had major political consequences. Following the sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large- scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite the Soviets consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The \"submarine hunts\", which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine \"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\" (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in SEK.Aired 16 April 2012. \"SVT Vetenskapens V\u00e4rld: \"Ig Nobel\" \" (in Swedish).
