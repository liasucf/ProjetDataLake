With the museum's director, Roy Chapman Andrews, she traveled to Central Asia in 1918 for the museum's First and Second Asiatic Zoological Expeditions. ==Early life== Yvette Huen Borup was born in Paris to American parents, Henry Dana Borup (1854-1916) and Mary Watson Brandreth Borup (1854-1897). Her father was an American military attach\u00e9 in Paris and Berlin before World War I. Her maternal grandfather, George A. Brandreth, and her great-grandfather, Congressman Aaron Ward, were both New York politicians. Her great-great- grandfather, Elkanah Watson, was a notable New York businessman. Her older brother, George Brandreth Borup (1885-1912), was assistant to Robert Peary on the North Pole Expedition, and wrote a book about his experiences in the Arctic. Yvette Borup was educated in France, Germany, Italy, and New York.Lydia Pyne, \"Yvette Borup Andrews: Photographing Central Asia\", The Public Domain Review (January 10, 2018).

She was the photographer assigned to the museum's First Asiatic Zoological Expedition (1916-1917), to China, Tibet, and Burma, and the Second Asiatic Zoological Expedition (1918), to Mongolia and North China, both expeditions led by her husband. She developed her still images and films in a portable \"rubber darkroom\" in the field. In the 1920s she was again in the field with Andrews, as photographer on the museum's Central Asiatic Expeditions. On that trip, she photographed the last Maidari Festival in Ulaanbaatar, creating a valuable historical document of the custom. Her photographs were published in Camps and Trails in China (1918), a book she co- authored with her husband.Roy Chapman Andrews and Yvette Borup Andrews, Camps and Trails in China: A Narrative of Exploration, Adventure and Sport in Little-Known China (New York & London, 1918). More photographs by Andrews appeared in Across Mongolian Plains (1921).Roy Chapman Andrews, Across Mongolian Plains: A Naturalist's Account of China's \"Great Northwest\"(D. Appleton and company 1921). Soon after their divorce, Roy Chapman Andrews told an audience that \"Physically and intellectually, women may be the equals of men for the work of exploration, but temperamentally they are not. They do not stand up under the little daily annoyances that loom large to them in the somewhat trying work involved on an expedition. The trivialities which men can ignore completely disturb them and prevent them from settling down to hard and conscientious work.\" The Society of Woman Geographers objected to his observations.\"Scientist Andrews Will Try Again to Mix Marriage and Exploration\" Laredo Times (June 16, 1935): 14. via NewspaperArchive.com In 1940, she was active with the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, volunteering as a \"Minute Woman\" at a phone bank to build support for the United States' entry into World War II.Mary E.
