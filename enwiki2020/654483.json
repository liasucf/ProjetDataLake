    "text": "Near the main plaza, 1941 Orocovis (from Taino language, Orocobix meaning remembrance of the first mountain) is a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Central Mountain Range, north of Villalba and Coamo; south of Morovis and Corozal; southeast of Ciales; east of Jayuya; and west of Barranquitas. Orocovis is spread over 17 barrios and Orocovis Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas- Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Since before the Spanish colonization in the 16th century, Ta\u00edno Indians were already established in the Orocovis region. They were led by the cacique Orocobix and his group of Taino was known as the Jatibonicu. After Spaniards settled in the island, the region was called Barros and designated as a barrio of Barranquitas. On May 25, 1825, the neighbors of the region granted Don Juan de Rivera Santiago the powers to request the Governor authorization to found a municipality in Barros, where they had bought almost 14 acres of land from Do\u00f1a Eulalia de Rivera, who donated an additional acre to establish several municipal works. However, due to the distance from bodies of water, the settlement was moved to another place. On November 10, 1825, Governor Miguel de la Torre granted permission to found the new municipality of Barros. In 1838, the parish of San Juan Bautista de Barros was created and was blessed and inaugurated on October 29 of the same year. However, on 1875, a fire destroyed the church, the King's House, the priest's house and several homes. In 1928, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a resolution to change the name of Barros to Orocovis, to honor the Ta\u00edno cacique of the same name, who lived in that region. ===Hurricane Maria=== Puerto Rico National Guard Soldiers distributed water and food to the community of Orocovis, on Sept. 29 Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Orocovis due to significant rainfall. Carmen Maldonado, the mayor of Morovis, a bordering municipality, spoke to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, requesting his help and Cuomo responded by contacting H.e.a.r.t. 9/11, a non-profit organization. In early 2019, Maldonado received and thanked volunteers from H.e.a.r.t. 9/11, mostly carpenters who came to Morovis to repair and rebuild homes damaged by the hurricane. In mid-June, 2019 the group of H.e.a.r.t. 9/11 volunteers, along with volunteers in Puerto Rico continued their work, including building the roofs of many homes in Orocovis. ==Symbols== ===Flag of Orocovis=== The Flag of Orocovis is formed by five vertical stripes: Two green stripes at the ends, representing the territories of Aibonito and Barranquitas; and a blue one in the center representing the regional domain of the cacique Orocobix prior to the Spanish colonization. These stripes are divided by two narrower white stripes, representing the territories granted by Barranquitas and Morovis to form the municipality in 1825. Over the blue portion there's an oval with a sun. The sun has seventeen rays that represent the different regions of the town. The sun, being the center of our solar system, represents Orocovis as the center of the island of Puerto Rico. ===Coat of arms=== The oval is symbol of the letter \"O\", initial of the name of the town. In each quadrant appear representative elements of the town. In the left superior quadrant a Ta\u00edno Indian bust, symbol of the great \"Chief Orocobix\" and the Indian heritage of the town, silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. The Indian bust faces tobarrios the star or sun that appears in the superior right quadrant, which is in gold on a blue background and represents the territorial municipality with its seventeen rays or demarcations. In the inferior right quadrant, a plantain plant is observed representing the agriculture, silhouetted in gold on a silver-plated background. A bridge also silhouetted in gold on a blue background, above the river appears in the left inferior quadrant. ===Nicknames=== Most of Orocovis nicknames stem from its location in the center of the island. Some of them are: \"Coraz\u00f3n de Puerto Rico\" (Heart of Puerto Rico) and \"Centro Geogr\u00e1fico de Puerto Rico\" (Geographical Center of Puerto Rico). The center of the island of Puerto Rico is in a ward called \"Pellejas\", on Road 566, Km 5.7. Former sayings about the center of the Island being in front of the Catholic church was determined to be false by engineers from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag\u00fcez Campus. ==Geography== Welcome to Orocovis sign at a lookout on PR-155 Orocovis is mountainous with many valleys.
