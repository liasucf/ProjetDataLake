    "text": "Rozpor is a Slovakian punk band from Bratislava, Slovakia, performing Oi! and hardcore punk. They are known for their strict anti-fascist stance. == History == The band began performing in May 1999. Members put down its formation to a dislike of the numerous sophists and pseudo-intellectuals flooding the Bratislava anarcho-punk and crustcore scenes of the time, and as a response to the absence of bands of a similar nature in the region. Rejecting lyrics about transnational corporations and the third world as issues distant from their lives, they planned songs on topics they knew and which impacted them directly. They also wanted to avoid tormented clich\u00e9s about police, neo-Nazis, and \"the system\". In 2000, Rozpor self-published their debut album/demo, Nezabudneme! (We Will Not Forget!). Their 2002 album, Ileg\u00e1lna spravodlivos\u0165 (Illegal Justice), brought the band not only participation in punk compilations and intensive touring in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and nearby, but also a creative decade of additional releases under \"\u017diadna zna\u010dka \u2013 No label\", by which the band highlights the DIY (Do It Yourself) ethic. Rozpor has gained notoriety for its passionate and original stage show, the frequent brawls accompanying its performances, many of its fans' rowdy nature, for playing shows in poverty-stricken Roma regions, and for their opposition to Slovak far right politician Marian Kotleba. The band drew minor controversy in 2008 following an appearance on \u010cesk\u00e1 televize, when the Czech Republic's Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting investigated a complaint about the display of an Antifa flag and the lead singer's \"Good Night White Pride\" T-shirt during the broadcast. ==Personnel== === Current members === * Fabko \u2013 lead vocals (2015 \u2013 present), drums (2011) * Zorro \u2013 drums (2013 \u2013 present) * Datra \u2013 lead guitar, vocals (1999 \u2013 present) * Bedla \u2013 bass, vocals (2015 \u2013 present) === Past members === * Filip \u2013 drums, vocals (1999 \u2013 2013) * Walter \u2013 lead vocals (1999 \u2013 2001) * Lupes \u2013 bass, vocals (1999 \u2013 2011) * Jazzy \u2013 bass, vocals (2011 \u2013 2015) * Rumun \u2013 lead vocals (2001 \u2013 2015, additional appearances in later videos and recordings) * \u017dlna \u2013 drums (2011, 2018) * Harley \u2013 drums (2011, 2016) == Discography == * 2000 - Nezabudneme!
