    "text": "Perameles papillon, the butterfly bandicoot, is an extinct species of bandicoot native to the Nullarbor Plain in Australia. It is named for the dark brown patch on its rump, which resembles a butterfly. It was described in 2018 based on existing skins and osteological material within museum collections in Australia. It is believed to have become extinct sometime during the mid- twentieth century due to predation by non-native foxes introduced during the time of European settlement. ==References== Category:Peramelemorphs Category:Marsupials of Australia ",
