However, General Chen Cheng opposed Guan's appointment as security commander of Manchuria because of the intense rivalry between the two of them, and Guan was appointed as garrison commander of Yunnan instead.

He formally resigned his position as commander-in-chief of the army in 1950. ==Retirement in Hong Kong== During his stay in Hong Kong, Guan declined any political activities and spent most of his time in calligraphy and Chinese opera.
