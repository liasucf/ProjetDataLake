    "text": "Bishop John Moore (born 27 June 1834 or 1835) served as the second Bishop of St. Augustine, Florida in 1877\u20131901. ==Biography== Moore was born in County Westmeath, Ireland and moved to Charleston, South Carolina at the age of 14. Bishop Moore was very influential in the expansion of Catholic schools in Florida and recruitment of numerous religious nuns and priests to meet the ministerial needs of the diocese which encompassed the entire state at that time. Most notably among the priests, the Benedictine monks arrived in San Antonio in 1886 initially to serve German immigrants, and the Jesuit fathers came to Tampa in 1889 after a yellow fever outbreak took the lives of one fourth of the state's diocesan priests.https://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=37548 Moore would charge the Benedictines with establishing and servicing a number of mission churches from Pasco County northward, while the Jesuits covered Hillsborough County southward, all the way to Key West. Bishop Moore High School, a Catholic secondary school in Orlando, is named for him. ==References== ==External links== *St. Augustine Bishops ==Episcopal succession== Category:1830s births Category:1901 deaths Category:People from County Westmeath Category:Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923) Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Saint Augustine Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Religious leaders from South Carolina ",
