It is endemic to north-east Queensland, where it inhabits streams in rainforest. Lestoidea brevicauda is a medium-sized to large damselfly, dark coloured with dull orange to greenish markings. ==Etymology== The species name brevicauda is derived from two Latin words: brevis meaning short; and cauda meaning tail. In 1996 Theischinger named this species with regard to the short appendages at the tip of the male abdomen. ==Gallery== Lestoidea brevicauda female wings (34442156730).jpg | Female wings Lestoidea brevicauda male wings (34442159930).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Lestoideidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by G\u00fcnther Theischinger Category:Insects described in 1996 Category:Damselflies ",
