After confronting him, he tells Robbo they were partners in crime, and urges him to come back. After he kidnaps and attempts to murder Kat, Robbo saves her and kills Novak, burying him in the bush. As the police uncover Novak's death, they close in on Robbo as the prime suspect. After Kat and Ash discover proof of his guilt, he tries to convince her to flee the Bay with him, but she refuses.

Robbo is finally able to recall that his real name is Ryan Shaw and that his family are dead. As he goes to hand himself in to the police, he is spotted by Ash, who chases him up to the headland. Robbo gives in and prepares for Ash to beat him, but the police arrive and arrest them both. However Robbo is later released on bail until his trial. At the near conclusion of Robbo's trial, with the jury having reached a verdict, and the Judge about to read it out, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) unexpectedly storm into the courtroom and hastily seize Robbo. An AFP officer tells Tori to forget Beckett Reid ever existed as Robbo is rushed into an unmarked police van. Robbo is taken to an unknown AFP base and is cuffed to a table in an interview room. During the interview, his memories start coming back as he sees dozen of pictures of him and his family. An AFP officer, Lance Salisbury (Angus McLaren), tells Robbo that he is an AFP officer. Lance confirms to Robbo that his real name is Ryan Shaw, and explains that Robbo was working undercover as Beckett Reid to track down the people that killed his family. His real identity was completely wiped off of the system like he never existed. A new fictional identity was created as part of the cover story to ensure the crimes that he had supposedly committed never actually happened, and that no one knew he is an AFP officer. Additionally, it is further revealed that Robbo was sent to Summer Bay to protect Kat as part of his undercover mission, but everything went wrong when he lost his memories. Robbo returns to the Bay, accompanied by Lance, for unfinished business. Lance returns all of his belongings, including his real passport, driver's licence, and credit cards. Additionally, Lance gives back Robbo's AFP ID badge and advises him to think about returning to AFP.

Robbo returns two months later for Tori's first ultrasound at the hospital. Jasmine sees him and leaves, refusing to talk to him. Robbo tries to talk to her, but Jasmine struggles with his presence and admits that his departure brought up memories of her father leaving her when she was young.
