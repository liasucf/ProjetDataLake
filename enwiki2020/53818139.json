    "text": "\"Loyalty\" (stylized as \"LOYALTY.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The song was later sent to urban and rhythmic radio June 20, 2017 as the second single from the album. The sixth track on the album (ninth on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song features Barbadian singer Rihanna on vocals and was written by Lamar, DJ Dahi, Sounwave, Rihanna, and Terrace Martin. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance. ==Critical reception== Complex calls it a \"standout track\" and one of Damns most \"radio-friendly cuts\". The Fader writer Jason Parham calls \"Loyalty\", \"anxious, berserk, and beautifully intransigent in [its] own right\" and \"equal parts pop, funk, and brooding rap hymnal\". Frank Guan of Vulture enjoyed the song, especially Rihanna's part, saying \"though only eight bars, Rihanna's sung rap is as fluent as it is brief, a swift and casual tour of her accomplishments.\" Rap-Up called the song a \"standout track that allows Kung Fu Kenny and Bad Gal RiRi to address allegiance from a variety of angles.\" ==Composition== The song contains samples of \"24K Magic\" produced by Shampoo Press & Curl and The Stereotypes, and performed by American singer Bruno Mars. ==Music video== The music video for the song was released to Lamar's Vevo channel on YouTube on July 28, 2017. It was directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies and includes an appearance from featured artist Rihanna. Jordan Darville of The Fader gave the music video a positive review, praising the visuals and called Lamar and Rihanna's adventure together \"carefully crafted [and] suitably amorous.\" ==Live performances== Lamar has performed \"Loyalty\" on the Damn tour. == Credits and personnel == Rihanna is a featured vocalist on \"Loyalty\". *Kendrick Duckworth \u2013 songwriter *Rihanna \u2013 vocals, songwriter *Dacoury Natche \u2013 songwriter, producer, additional vocals *Byron \"Mr. Talkbox\" Chambers \u2013 additional vocals *Mark Spears \u2013 songwriter, producer *Terrace Martin \u2013 songwriter, producer *Anthony \"Topdawg\" Tiffith \u2013 songwriter, producer *B\u0113kon \u2013 additional production and vocals *Kid Capri \u2013 additional vocals *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Jamal Owens - Master mixer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia Urban (ARIA) | 4 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 18 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 63 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100) | 47 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 66 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2017/hot-r-and-and-b-hip- hop-songs | 33 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rhythmic (Billboard)http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2017/rhythmic-songs | 21 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1654 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Label ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| United States | rowspan=\"2\" | June 20, 2017 | Rhythmic contemporary radio | rowspan=\"2\" | | |- | Urban contemporary radio | |} ==References== == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Rihanna songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by Terrace Martin Category:Music videos directed by Dave Meyers (director) Category:2017 singles Category:Songs written by DJ Dahi Category:Songs written by Sounwave Category:Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Category:Interscope Records singles ",
