    "text": "The Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC) is a Midwest-based non-profit environmental advocacy group, with offices in Chicago, Columbus (OH), Des Moines (IA), Duluth (MN), Jamestown (ND), Madison (WI), Sioux Falls (SD), and Washington, D.C. ELPC's mission is to advance environmental progress and economic development together throughout the Midwest through projects that advance clean energy, clean air, clean water and clean transportation. Founded in 1993, ELPC today has a staff of more than 40 public interest attorneys, public policy analysts, scientists, finance specialists, and media experts. ELPC's annual revenues of about $6 million are raised from more than 160 foundation and individual major donors, as well as many supportive members across the Midwest and nation. The organization has consistently received the highest rating from Charity Navigator, the independent non-profit rating agency. == About == ELPC was founded in 1993 by Howard A. Learner, a public- interest attorney, after a year-long strategic planning process sponsored by seven major foundations. The organization advocates for improved policies and policy implementation at the federal, state and local levels related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean air, clean water and smart transportation. Attorneys who work for the organization represent local grassroots organization in litigation related to the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and other major pieces of national environmental legislation before federal and state courts as well as state and local administrative bodies. The organization states that its attorneys and policy advocates work on multi- disciplinary teams alongside scientists, finance specialists, media experts and others. The organization's governing leadership includes a Board of Directors, Science Advisory Council, Next Generation Advisory Council and state-based advisory councils in Iowa, Michigan and South Dakota. Members of the Board and Advisory Councils include individuals from legal, civic, business and non-profit sectors. == Programs == ELPC runs a number of environmental advocacy programs: * Climate Change Solutions: ELPC aims to transform the Midwest region into a center for climate solutions that address the two most prominent sources of carbon pollution\u2014energy generation and transportation. This work spans the organization's other program areas related to Clean Air, Clean Energy, and Clean Transportation. * Clean Energy: ELPC works to create policies that drive markets for clean energy to succeed. This includes creating markets for wind and solar energy, designing energy efficiency programs and policies, promoting farm energy, and advancing transmission policies that support clean energy. * Clean Air: ELPC works to clean up or shut down old, dirty coal plants, often providing free legal assistance to local grassroots organizations. * Clean Water: ELPC works in Midwest states to make sure the Clean Water Act is implemented and enforced well, often providing free legal assistance to local grassroots organizations. * Clean Transportation: ELPC works to advance the Midwest High-Speed Rail Network, create a market for cleaner cars, and oppose wasteful highway spending. * Special Places: ELPC works with grassroots groups throughout the Midwest to protect the region's most precious natural treasures, including places like the Driftless Area, Great Lakes, Saugatuck Dunes, Mississippi River, and North Woods. == Political activity == Impacts made by the ELPC include: 2012 March 15: Indiana adopted anti-degradation standards, required by the Clean Water Act, to protect waterways.
