The temple was built around 300 years ago by Purohit (Pareek) brothers who came to Kurseong from Mokalpur (Mokala) a small town of Rajasthan. As the Brahmin family of Pareeks were devotees of Lord Krishna the male members of the family made statues of Lord Jagannath from the holy neem tree of the village and set out in different directions to make temples of Lord Jagganath. As per available records many temples of Lord Jagannath were established in different parts of India.
