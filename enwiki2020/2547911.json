    "text": "Peter Willey (born 6 December 1949) is a former English cricketer, who played as a right-handed batsman and right-arm offbreak bowler. In and out of the England team, he interrupted his international career for three years by taking part in the first of the England players' South African rebel tours in 1982. After his playing career ended, he became a Test umpire. ==Playing career== As his career developed, Willey became a leading exponent of the \"open stance\" style of batting, where the batsman looks squarely at the bowler, rather than the traditional \"side-on\" style, looking past his own shoulder at the bowler. Known for his intimidating and moody image, and his ability to score runs off fast bowlers, he was constantly picked against the formidable West Indian pace attack, only to be dropped again for games against more gentle opposition.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/feb/03/cricket-england- west-indies-2009-cricket He scored two hundreds against the West Indies, although his overall Test batting average ended at under 27. ==Umpiring career== Upon his retirement from playing cricket, Willey became an umpire, becoming responsible for international Test Matches in 1996. However, he declined an offer to join the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires in 2001 when it was established, citing family reasons.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/3019922/Willey- refuses-to-join-elite-umpire.html Willey continued to umpire Test matches in England until 2015, when he turned 65. ECB policy requires all umpires to retire when they reach this age, in order to allow younger umpires to gain employment.https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/umpire-peter-willey-challenges- dismissal-grounds-age-discrimination Willey and fellow Northamptonshire team- mate and umpire George Sharp challenged this decision at an employment tribunal, alleging age discrimination on the part of the ECB, but lost their case.http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2015/content/story/849331.html ==Personal life== Willey is married, and has two children, including David Willey who plays for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the England cricket team, and a grandson. ==Anecdotes== According to an urban myth, it was during a Test match between the West Indies and England, when Michael Holding was about to bowl to Willey, that the radio commentator Brian Johnston said: \"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\". While Wisden stated that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this,Wisden archive Johnston's co-commentator, Henry Blofeld, recalled the incident as having taken place at The Oval in 1976.Test Match Special The comment is also attributed to Richie Benaud in a Television commentary in 1980 The story is sometimes told the other way around, with Willey bowling to Holding: however, Willey did not bowl to Holding in that particular match. In 1979, Willey caught Dennis Lillee off the bowling of Graham Dilley, resulting in a scorecard entry of: \"Lillee, c. Willey, b. Dilley\".Cricket Archive \u2013 match scorecard.
