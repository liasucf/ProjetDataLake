Most of her works are depicted in black and white. Most of her art, which are photographs, depict the women in Puerto Rico and their treatment in such a \"patriarchal\" environment. Her work is not conservative in any way. It is the opposite and portraits women and the stereotypes, and social ideas and roles created and given to women in Puerto Rico == Education == Frieda Med\u00edn attended the University of Puerto Rico from 1986-198, and attended Film Video Arts in New York in 1988.
