    "text": "Trigonias is an extinct genus of rhinoceros from the late Eocene (Chadronian) some 35 million years ago of North America (Prothero, 2005). Trigonias was about 2.1 m (7 ft) long and, despite lacking horns, looked a lot like modern rhinos. Its front legs had five toes (as contrasted with three in modern rhinos), the fifth of which was vestigial. A specimen of T. osborni was estimated to have a weight of about 391.4 kg (862.9 lbs).http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=basicTaxonInfo&taxon;_no=52444 ==Notes== ==References== *Prothero, Donald R. 2005.
