    "text": "Satellite City is a Welsh sitcom which started out originally as a radio show on BBC Radio Wales in 1994 and then evolved into a TV version made by BBC Wales and was first broadcast in 1996. The setting was an imaginary small town in the South Wales Valleys. The plot centered on the arrival of Randy (Michael Neill), an American visitor, who was taken in by the Price family (but had to share a bed with pensioner Idris, played by Islwyn Morris). Randy soon formed a relationship with local girl Mandy (Shelley Miranda Barrett). The other main characters were Idris's son, Gwynne (played by Boyd Clack, who also co-wrote the series), Gwynne's wife Moira (Ri Richards), barman Dai (Rhodri Hugh), and Mandy's friend Bridget (Einir Sion), replaced in the final series by the character of Donna (Kirsten Clark). In the final episode Randy moved into his own house with Mandy. There are continual references to Idris's ferret Sylvester (his beloved pet), and he eventually discovers that it is, in fact, a girl ferret. The reason for the title is explained in the first episode: the district had been used for the initial testing of satellite dishes, but when the time came to return the dishes or pay for the service, no one returned them and no one paid. Satellite City thus suggests a run-down area. In 1999 the series won a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Light Entertainment. A pilot, eighteen 30-minute episodes and a one-hour special were made in all. The pilot was significantly different from the remainder of the series, portraying Idris as senile and deluded into believing that clothes pegs are talking to him. ==Cast== * Michael Neill as Randy * Islwyn Morris as Idris * Shelley Miranda Barrett as Mandy * Boyd Clack as Gwynne * Ri Richards as Moira * Rhodri Hugh as Dai * Einir Sion as Bridget * Kirsten Clark as Donna * Brian Hibbard As Spike ==Episodes== ===Pilot (1995)=== ===Series 1 (1996)=== === Series 2 (1997\u201398) === === Series 3 (1998\u201399) === ==References== == External links == * Satellite City BBC programme page * Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:BBC Cymru Wales television shows Category:Welsh television shows Category:1996 British television series debuts Category:Television shows set in Wales Category:1990s Welsh television series Category:1999 British television series endings Category:1990s British sitcoms ",
