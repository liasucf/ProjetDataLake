Retrieved 10 August 2015.Packed in promise. Hindustan Times. (5 January 2014). Retrieved 10 August 2015. == Career == He started his career in the music industry with the name \"Cool Equal\", but then changed his name to Badshah. In 2018 Badshah released his first album O.N.E. \u2013 Original Never End. His 2019 song \"Paagal\" reached 74.8 million views on YouTube within 24 hours, setting the record for the most- viewed video in 24 hours on YouTube. BTS fans claimed that the artist had bought the views to cross the global record due to his low number of likes in the first 24 hours, but YouTube did not confirm whether the views are real or fake. The song also did not appear in the 100-position Global Top Music Videos chart for the week. However, Badshah denied it was fake views, but admitted his record label Sony Music India bought paid ads. An explanation for YouTube not acknowledging the record was that Badshah's record label Sony Music India had purchased advertisements from Google and YouTube that embedded the video or directed fans to it in some way. However, it has emerged that this is a common practice in the global music industry, and that similar practices had previously been used by the record labels of previous record holders such as Ariana Grande and Blackpink. This has cast doubt on some of the 24-hour viewership records on YouTube. His song \"Genda Phool\" was released by Sony Music India in 2020. It had mixing with a Bengali folk song \"Boro Loker Biti Lo\". Ratan Kahar, a Bengali artist, claimed to be the original writer and composer of the folk song. Though Badshah later released a statement saying that it was a traditional Baul folk song which was not copyrighted, since folk music does not fall under copyright protections and is thus in the public domain. ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#cfc; text- align:center;\" |Year |Song |Language |Note(s) |Reference(s) |- |2012 |\"Saturday Saturday\" (Indeep Bakshi featuring Badshah) |Hindi | | |- |2013 |Proper Patola (Diljit Dosanjh featuring Badshah) | rowspan=\"6\" |Punjabi | | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2014 |\"Chull\" (Fazilpuria featuring Badshah) | | |- |\"Bandook\" (with Raxstar) | | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |2015 |\"Desi Hiphop\" (Manj Musik featuring Roach Killer, Raxstar, Humble the Poet, Big Dhillon, Badshah, Sarb Smooth, Raftaar) | | |- |DJ Waley Babu (featuring Aastha Gill) | Released as ONE (Original Never Ends) | |- |\"Wakhra Swag\" (Navv Inder featuring Badshah) | | |- |\"Baaki Baatein Peene Baad\" (Arjun Kanungo featuring Badshah) |Hindi | | |- |\"Vroom Vroom\" (Simranjeet Singh featuring Badshah) | rowspan=\"2\" |Punjabi | | |- | rowspan=\"6\" |2016 |\"Saturday Saturday (Khul Jaaye Masti)\" (featuring Arjun Kanungo and Aastha Gill) |Remix of \"Saturday Saturday\" | |- |\"Lover Boy\" (Shrey Singhal featuring Badshah) |Hindi | | |- |\"RayZR Mera Swag\" (featuring Aastha Gill) | rowspan=\"2\" |Punjabi | | |- |\"Garrari Pitbull Te\" (Gurinder Rai featuring Badshah) | | |- |\"Driving Slow\" | rowspan=\"21\" | Hindi | | |- |\"Move Your Body\" (with Sean Paul) |Music by DJ Shadow Dubai | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2017 |\"Pop the Bottle\" (with Vishal\u2013Shekhar and Akasa Singh) | | |- |\"Mercy\" (featuring Lauren Gottlieb) | Released as ONE (Original Never Ends) | |- | rowspan=\"7\" | 2018 | \"KareJa\" (featuring Aastha Gill) | | |- | \"Buzz\" (Aastha Gill featuring Badshah) | | |- | \"Heartless\" (featuring Aastha Gill) | Released as ONE (Original Never Ends) | |- | \"Nain\" (featuring Aastha Gill) | | |- | \"Aashiq Awaara\" (featuring Sunidhi Chauhan) | | |- | \"She Move It Like\" (featuring Warina Hussain) | | |- | \"How We Do It\" (Now United featuring Badshah) | | |- | rowspan=\"6\" | 2019 | \"Har Ghoont Mein Swag\" (featuring Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani) | | |- |\"Paagal\" | | |- |\"Kamaal\"(Uchana Amit) featuring Badshah) | | |- |\"Are you ready for the Big Bang\" (Flipkart) | | |- |\"Interstellar\" | | |- |\"Theraphy\" | | |- | rowspan=\"4\" | 2020 |\"Genda Phool\" (featuring Payal Dev) | | |- |\"Boht Tej\" (Fotty Seven featuring Badshah) | | |- |\"Toxic\" | | |- |Haryan roadways Fazilpuria featuring Badshah) | | |} == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"background:#ffc;\"| | Denotes films that have not yet been released |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#cfc; text-align:center;\" |Year |Movie |Song |Singer(s)/co-singer(s) |Composer(s) |Language |Label |Reference(s) |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2014 |Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania |\"Saturday Saturday\" |Akriti Kakkar, Indeep Bakshi |Sharib-Toshi | rowspan=\"8\" | Hindi |Sony Music India | |- |Fugly |Dhup Chik |Aastha Gill, Raftaar |Raftaar |rowspan=3|T-Series | |- |Khoobsurat |\"Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai\" |Aastha Gill |Badshah | |- |rowspan=\"6\"|2015 |Bajrangi Bhaijaan |\"Selfie Le Le Re\" |Vishal Dadlani, Nakash Aziz, Pritam |Pritam | |- |ABCD 2 |\"Vande Mataram\" |Daler Mehndi, Tanishka Sanghvi & Divya Kumar |Sachin-Jigar |rowspan=\"2\" | Zee Music Company | |- |Second Hand Husband |\"Bad Baby\" |Gippy Grewal | | |- |All Is Well |\"Chaar Shanivaar\" |Vishal Dadlani, Armaan Malik |Amaal Mallik |T-Series | |- |Jazbaa |\"Aaj Raat Ka Scene\" |Shraddha Pandit |Badshah |Zee Music Company | |- |Vedalam |\"Aaluma Doluma\" |Anirudh Ravichander | |Tamil |Sony Music India | |- | rowspan=\"8\" |2016 |Sanam Re |\"Akkad Bakkad\" |Neha Kakkar |Badshah | rowspan=\"20\" |Hindi |T-Series | |- | |\"Teri Yaad\" |colspan=\"2\"|Himesh Reshammiya |HR Musik Limited and T-Series | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Kapoor & Sons |\"Kar Gayi Chull\" |Fazilpuria, Sukriti Kakar, Neha Kakkar |Amaal Mallik, Badshah |rowspan=\"2\"|Sony Music India | |- |\"Let's Nacho\" |Benny Dayal |Nucleya, Benny Dayal | |- |Sultan |\"Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai\" |Vishal Dadlani, Shalmali Kholgade, Ishita, Neeti Mohan |Vishal-Shekhar |YRF Music | |- |Baar Baar Dekho |\"Kala Chashma\" |Amar Arshi, Neha Kakkar, Indeep Bakshi |Badahah, Prem-Hardeep |Zee Music Company | |- |Ae Dil Hai Mushkil |\"The Breakup Song\" |Arijit Singh, Jonita Gandhi and Nakash Aziz |Pritam |Sony Music India | |- |Shivaay |\"Bolo Har Har Har\" |Mithoon, Mohit Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh Megha Sriram Dalton, Anugrah and The Vamps |Mithoon |T-Series | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |2017 |OK Jaanu |\"The Humma Song\" | A.
