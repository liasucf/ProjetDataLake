Paul Getty Museum The Rue Mosnier with Flags is an 1878 oil on canvas painting by \u00c9douard Manet, showing the eponymous Parisian street, decorated with French flags for the first national holiday on 30 June 1878, the F\u00eate de la Paix (Celebration of Peace). The F\u00eate de la Paix was held during that year's Exposition Universelle, which together marked France's recovery after the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune. The holiday was moved to 14 July in 1880 to become Bastille Day. The painting is held by the J. Paul Getty Museum.http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/825 The Rue Mosnier with Flags], The J. Paul Getty MuseumThe Rue Mosnier with Flags, Google Arts & Culture The painting depicts a scene on the Rue Mosnier, now the , which is overlooked by Manet's studio at 4 . It was painted from an upstairs window, with tricolour flags hanging from the buildings along the road, above passing pedestrians and carriages. In the foreground is a man with a ladder, and a one-legged man on crutches, possibly a veteran wounded in the Franco-Prussian War. Behind a fence to the left is rubble from building works to extend the Gare Saint-Lazare. The painting measures and it is signed and dated in the lower left corner, \"Manet / 1878\". This work echoes the composition of another Manet painting of 1878, Road-menders in the Rue Mossnier. Another 1878 Manet painting of a similar scene of the Rue Monsier, decorated with flags, is held in a private collection. Similar paintings of flags on the Rue Montorgueil and Rue Saint-Denis in Paris in 1878 were made by Claude Monet, and these works were echoed by a 1917 painting of New York by Childe Hassam, The Avenue in the Rain. The painting passed through the hands of Jean-Baptiste Faure in the 1890s, and then Auguste Pellerin until 1910. It was owned by the Hungarians Marcell Nemes and then Baron M\u00f3r Lip\u00f3t Herzog, and it was sold before 1932 to German banker Jakob Goldschmidt. After his death in 1955, it was sold by his estate in London in 1958 to Paul Mellon, and then sold at Christie's in New York in 1989 to the J. Paul Getty Museum, in California. ==Monet== File:Edouard Manet Pflasterer in der Rue Mosnier.jpg| \u00c9douard Manet, Road- menders in the Rue Mossnier, 1878, private collection File:Edouard Manet Rue Mosnier Decorated with Flags 1878.jpg|\u00c9douard Manet, Rue Monsier with flags, 1878, private collection File:Claude Monet - The Rue Montorgueil in Paris.
