    "text": "Smile is the sixth studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released on August 28, 2020, by Capitol Records, three years after its predecessor Witness (2017). Perry worked with a multitude of producers on the album, including Josh Abraham, Carolina Liar, The Daylights, G Koop, Andrew Goldstein, Oligee, Oscar G\u00f6rres, Oscar Holter, Ilya, Ian Kirkpatrick, The Monsters & Strangerz, Charlie Puth, Stargate and Zedd. She described Smile as her \"journey towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love\". Musically a pop album, Smile is characterized by its themes of self-help and empowerment. Two singles preceded the album: \"Daisies\", the lead single, was released on May 15, 2020, and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100; its followup, \"Smile\", followed on July 10, 2020. Smile also contains Perry's 2019 standalone singles \"Never Really Over\" and \"Harleys in Hawaii\" in its standard tracklist. The Japanese and fan editions of the album further includes \"Small Talk\" and \"Never Worn White\". Upon release, Smile received mixed reviews from music critics, who were favorable towards Perry's maturing image, but criticized the production and lyricism. On the Billboard 200 chart, Smile debuted at number 5 with 50,000 units, marking Perry's fifth top-10 album in the United States. The album reached the top-five in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, the United Kingdom, top-10 in Austria, Ireland, and Italy, and the top-20 in Finland, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. ==Background and release== Smile was conceived following a period of Perry's depression, public criticism, breakup with then-boyfriend and current fianc\u00e9 Orlando Bloom, and her pregnancy. In March 2018, Ian Kirkpatrick announced he had worked with Perry on new music. In an interview with The Fader, he stated: \"We did a couple of days and she is amazing.\" He further stated that working with Perry was \"someone I've wanted to work with my whole life, and she was literally the most normal, no-ego person.\" In March 2020, Perry announced her intentions of releasing \"a lot\" of new music during the year's summer. In May, she announced \"Daisies\" as the album's lead single. The same month, Amazon Alexa announced the album's release date as August 14, 2020. In a June 2020 interview with Billboard, Perry discussed a new song, titled \"Teary Eyes\". She later confirmed the following month that \"Never Really Over\" will be on the album. The same month, the album's title was confirmed as Smile, after one of the songs on the album. The album will also be released as a bone white vinyl, alongside with a picture disc one, a cassette, and a limited deluxe edition CD, with a lenticular cover, and titled \"Fan edition\", being the latter available for preorder so far on Perry's and Universal Music Czech Republic's official webstores. On August 2, 2020, a flash sale went up on her online store for five days. This sale featured five limited-edition alternate covers of the standard edition of the album that could only be pre-ordered during this sale. On July 27, 2020, she announced that the album release date had been pushed back to August 28 due to \"unavoidable production delays\". ==Concept and artwork== Perry explained that Smile is about \"finding the light at the end of the tunnel\", and taking back your smile, and that the album comes from a place where she fell in after her career and relationship with Orlando Bloom hit a low point back in 2017. She discussed struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, and stated that gratitude is what saved her life. Perry also defined the album as her \"journey towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love\". The album's artwork features Perry as \"a glum clown with a red nose and a blue and white checkered suit above the title, Smile\". It was unveiled via a Twitter game that involved her fans/followers tweeting about the album to \"tweet to pop virtual balloons in order to uncover\" the album cover. In August, Perry unveiled a limited edition collection of vinyl picture discs and alternative CD packaging for the album. Five alternative covers/vinyl picture disc were available for pre-order for a period of five days.References for limited edition artwork: * Official store listings \u2013 * Twitter \u2013 ==Singles== \"Daisies\" was released on May 15, 2020 as the album's lead single. It debuted at number 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The title track was released as the second single on July 10, 2020, along with the album pre-order. Throughout 2019 and 2020, Perry released four solo songs, originally intended to be non- album singles. \"Never Really Over\", released on May 31, 2019, was announced to be on Smile by Perry in June 2020. \"Harleys in Hawaii\", released on October 16, 2019, was revealed to be on the standard track list upon the release of the album pre-order. \"Small Talk\", released August 9, 2019, and \"Never Worn White\", released March 5, 2020, did not make the standard track list, but ended up as bonus tracks on the \"Fan edition\" and \"Japan edition\" of the album. ===Promotional single=== Perry released \"What Makes a Woman\" as a promotional single ahead of the album on August 20, 2020. She also released an acoustic version exclusively on her Vevo page. In June 2020, she revealed \"What Makes a Woman\" is dedicated to her unborn daughter, stating: \"That is a hope I have for my future child, is that she doesn't have any limits on any of her dreams, or what she wants to be, or who she thinks she is.\" ==Critical reception== Upon release, Smile received a mixed reception from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the Smile received a weighted average score of 58, based on 18 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Album of the Year collected 21 reviews and calculated an average of 57 out of 100, while aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album 5.3 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Lindsay Zolandz of The New York Times thought that Smile tries to add brightness to the dark, with a lightness that was absent in its predecessor, Witness (2017). Mark Kennedy of Chicago Tribune deemed the album a course-correction that sets Perry back into pure pop, and labeled most of the album \"bit of a bummer\" due its apologetic tone. The i newspaper's Joe Muggs complimented the restrained production and Perry's maturation as a pop star, but dismissed the lyrical content as \"bit too much self-help book redemption\". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Kate Solomon noted that Smile feels very \"so earnest that it strays into cringe-worthy territory\", but displays the strongest traits of Perry's music: \"fizzy bops\" and huge hooks. USA Today writer Patrick Ryan opined that Smile exudes newfound joy, with some of the most carefree songs of the singer's career. However, he criticized the self-empowerment lyrics as clich\u00e9d, adding that Perry gives listeners a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu rather than seeking a new musical direction. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly described the album's sound as too familiar, unaltered from Perry's older discography. Craig Jenkins of Vulture found Smile to be lyrically weak, but overall an improvement over Witness, and named the singles as its best tracks. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine wrote that Perry avoids experimentation by opting to stay \"in her lane\". Kish Lal of The Sydney Morning Herald branded Smile as falling flat despite the honesty in subjects dealt. Louise Bruton of The Irish Times asserted that the album possesses perfect melodies, but cited the subpar lyrics as a drawback. In unfavorable reviews, Pitchfork writer Dani Blum dubbed Smile as clich\u00e9-ridden pop with confusing platitudes, that is also inapt for the COVID-19 pandemic. The A. V. Clubs Alex McLevy opined that Perry is \"struggling to be taken seriously\", as Smile holds back her ability to evolve, instead of the intended showcase of the singer's \"real\" side. Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote the record was dull and unadventurous, and did not believe the lyricism was memorable, while Helen Brown of The Independent called the album forgettable, and found the singer resorting to basics. Hannah Mylrea of NME wrote that the album comprises lackluster imitations and fillers, devoid of the catchy hooks and couplets of Perry's older records. Writing for Clash, Joe Rivers felt Smile lacked substance, and called the production outdated. ==Commercial performance== In the United States, Smile debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart, earning 50,000 album-equivalent units (including 35,000 sales), and marked Perry's fifth top-10 album; it was her first since One of the Boys (2008) to not reach the top spot. It accumulated a total of 19 million on-demand US streams from all its tracks in its opening week. In its second week on the Billboard 200, the album fell 49 spots to number 54. Smile opened at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart and UK Albums Chart, earning 8,579 units in the latter. In Ireland, the album entered at number nine on the Irish Albums Chart, marking Perry's fifth consecutive top-10 album in the country. Smile debuted at number two on Australia's ARIA Albums Chart, blocked from the top spot by Metallica's live album, S&M2.; In New Zealand, the album opened at number four on the NZ Top 40 Albums Chart, while on Japan's Oricon Albums chart, it arrived at number 39. In Germany, Smile debuted and peaked at number 14. ==Track listing== Notes and samples * \u2013 main and vocal production * \u2013 vocal production * \u2013 additional production * \u2013 production for the remixed version * \"Never Really Over\" contains interpolations from \"Love You Like That\", written by Dagny Sandvik, Jason Gill, Michelle Buzz. * \"Not the End of the World\" contains elements from \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\", written by Paul Leka, Gary DeCarlo, Dale Frashuer. * \"Smile\" contains samples from \"Jamboree\", written by Anthony Criss, Vincent Brown, Kier Gist. * Vinyl pressings of the album feature an alternative version of \"Smile\" featuring Diddy, with additional writers Sean Combs and Cordae Dunston. == Personnel == Adapted from the album liner notes. ===Musicians=== * Katy Perry \u2013 vocals (all tracks), background vocals (2) * Leah Haywood \u2013 background vocals (1) * Hayley Warner \u2013 background vocals (1) * Gino Barletta \u2013 background vocals (1) * Zedd \u2013 programming (1) * Daniel James \u2013 programming (1) * Leah Haywood \u2013 programming (1) * Sasha Sloan \u2013 background vocals (2) * Noonie Bao \u2013 background vocals (2) * Oscar Holter \u2013 drums, bass, keyboards, programming (2) * Rickard G\u00f6ransson \u2013 guitars (2) * Jacob Kasher Hindlin \u2013 background vocals (3) * Michael Pollack \u2013 background vocals (3, 6) * Madison Love \u2013 background vocals (3, 6) * Andrew Goldstein \u2013 guitars, drums, bass, percussion (3); background vocals, keyboards, programming (3, 6) * Oscar G\u00f6rres \u2013 drums, bass, percussion (3); keyboards, programming (3, 6) * Michael Pollack \u2013 synthesizers (3), guitars (4), piano (6) * Jon Bellion \u2013 background vocals (4) * Pierre Luc Rioux \u2013 guitars (4, 17) * Mikkel S.
