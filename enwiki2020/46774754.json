    "text": "is the 40th single by the Japanese idol girl group AKB48. It was released in Japan on May 20, 2015. == Background == Haruka Shimazaki serves as choreography center of this single's title song. It is also the last AKB48 single featuring member Rina Kawaei and SKE48 member Rena Matsui, who left the AKB48 group after the release of this single. == Release == The single was released in several versions: Type A (two editions: limited and regular), Type B (limited and regular), Type C (limited and regular), Type D (limited and regular), and a version called the \"Theater Edition\". All versions, except the Theater Edition, include a DVD with several music videos. The first presses of the single came with a ticket to vote in the AKB48 41st Single Senbatsu Election (to choose the members to be featured in the next AKB48's single, to be released in the summer.) == Music video == The music video for the title track was directed by Keishi \u014ctomo, best known as the director of the Ruroni Kenshin movie series. Unlike other Summer-themed AKB48 singles, this single's MV does not have a paradise scenery and girls in bathing suits. Instead, they focused more on action and most complex choreography that had been set aside in \"Kib\u014dteki Refrain\". == Reception == The single debuted at number one on Oricon's daily singles chart for the day of May 19, 2015, with sales of 1,472,375 copies. It also topped the weekly Oricon Singles Chart on the June 1 week, selling 1,673,211 copies.
