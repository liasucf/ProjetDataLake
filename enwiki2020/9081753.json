    "text": "Joana Tom\u00e1sia da C\u00e2mara (1730 - 1782), descendant of the Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara clan, was the second daughter of Jos\u00e9 da C\u00e2mara, heir to the title of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Miguel and the Countship of Riberia Grande, who was the 4th Countess of Ribeira Grande, without descendants. She married her uncle, D. Guido Augusto da C\u00e2mara e Ata\u00edde, born in Paris on 30 June 1718, who became the 14th and, ultimately, the last donatary-captain of the island of S\u00e3o Miguel and Count of Ribeira Grande. Guido Augusto began his role in 1757, but on 2 August 1766 the title of donatary-captain was extinguished, by decree of King Joseph I of Portugal. The couple never resided in the captaincy, and as a son of a member of the T\u00e1vora family, the count was jailed for his family's implication in the attempted regicide. The count died in the prison of Junqueira in 1770. Joana discovered that he died in 1777, when the prisoners were liberated. She had one son, Lu\u00eds Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Maria da C\u00e2mara, who was born in 1754 (and later died in 1802).
