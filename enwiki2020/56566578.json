    "text": "Around Brazil is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in 2005 and released by ACT Music. ==Recording and music== The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in September 2005. All of the tracks were recorded at the Rainbow Studio in Oslo, except for \"Partita de Mar\u00e7o\", which was recorded in Cologne. The album was produced by Siegfried Loch. Nabatov plays prepared piano on \"Depois que o Il\u00ea passar\". \"Valsa de P\u00f4rto Das Caixas\" is a delicate waltz by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim. On \"Partita de Mar\u00e7o\", the formal theme gradually emerges, \"almost like the sculptor finding the form that is already present in the uncut stone.\" It quotes Jobim's \"Waters of March\" and Bach. ==Release and reception== Around Brazil was released in Germany by ACT Music on 26 May 2006. It was the fifth in their Piano Works series. The Penguin Guide to Jazz described it as \"a quite extraordinary essay in modern pianism [...] he takes each piece out into areas of creative improvisation that no one else would have thought of\". They also highlighted the extreme separation of bass and treble in the recording. The MusicWeb reviewer wrote that, \"If you care about good jazz \u2013 or good music of any kind \u2013 you need to buy this CD.\" ==Track listing== #\"Desde que o samba \u00e9 samba\" (Caetano Veloso) #\"Estrada do Sol\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim) #\"Partita de Mar\u00e7o\" (Simon Nabatov) #\"Nen\u00ea\" (Ernesto Nazareth) #\"Eu vim da Bahia\" (Gilberto Gil) #\"Depois que o Il\u00ea passar\" (Miltao) #\"Na Baixa do Sapateiro\" (Ary Barroso) #\"My Sert\u00e3o\" (Nabatov) #\"Valsa de P\u00f4rto Das Caixas\" (Jobim) #\"Qualquer coisa\" (Veloso) #\"Voc\u00ea \u00e9 linda\"(Veloso) ==Personnel== *Simon Nabatov \u2013 piano ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:ACT Music albums Category:Solo piano jazz albums ",
