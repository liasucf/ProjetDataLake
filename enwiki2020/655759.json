An acronym for Communications And Reservations In National Airline. The name was from NAC prior to the 1978 merger with Air New Zealand. NAC (National Airways Corporation) was a separate domestic airline. Their system consisted of Message Switching, Reservations and FDDS - no DCS (I think checkin was still a manual process. The Air New Zealand system (international flights only) was called Terrier) and included DCS. Eventually both were replaced by a single system, which for largely internal politics reasons retained the name Carina. Carina DCS has remained the gold standard to this day. ==See also== *Cari\u00f1a * Carinae *Carine (disambiguation) *Karina (disambiguation) ",
