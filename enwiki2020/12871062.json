The village is about east of Glasgow and west of Edinburgh. The local Church of Scotland congregation is the Caldercruix and Longriggend Parish Church and the local Roman Catholic Church is Saint Mary's located on Glen Road. The village is home to an active community council. There is a combined primary school (Glengowan/St. Mary's Primary School) which serves the village and surrounding rural area. There are two Orange Lodges in Caldercruix. == History == Caldercruix developed in the 19th century as the papermaking and mining industries grew. The village was formerly home to a large paper mill, which closed in 1970. The village is situated by the North Calder Water and probably takes its name from the bends or crooks (cruiks) in the river. North Calder Water was dammed in the late 18th century to create Hillend Loch, which is used recreationally by angler and sailors. ==Railway== Caldercruix railway station was built in 1863, on the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway. The line closed to passengers in January 1956, and reopened in December 2010 as the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link, although the opening of Caldercruix station itself (alongside Drumgelloch and Armadale) was delayed until February 2011 due to bad weather conditions. Trains run east to and , and west to and (usually continuing to and ). ==References== ==External links== *Airdrie Museum *Caldercruix Community Centre *Caldercruix and Longriggend Parish Church *Monklands Online: The Story of Caldercruix Category:Villages in North Lanarkshire Category:Airdrie, North Lanarkshire ",
