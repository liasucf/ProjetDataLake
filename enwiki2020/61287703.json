She had a difficult personal life with an unhappy childhood and marriage. After her divorce, she lived in poverty in a forest with her two children. Her daughter died and her son escaped and did not return. She survived with the help of her friends. Throughout her life she corresponded with her friend Otokar B\u0159ezina who she met in Jino\u0161ov in 1887 and their letters resurfaced in 2008. Her autobiographical fragmentary novel 'Antieva' was published posthumously in 1997. == Bibliography == * Alfa.
