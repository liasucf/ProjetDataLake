    "text": "Eiwaz or Eihaz (reconstructed *\u012bhaz / *\u0113haz or *\u012bwaz / *\u0113waz) was a Proto- Germanic word for \"yew\" and is the reconstructed name of the rune . The rune survives in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc as \u0112oh \"yew\" (note that eoh \"horse\" has a short diphthong). \u0112oh could behave as both a vowel (perhaps /i\u02d0/), and as a consonant (in the range of /x ~ \u00e7/). As a vowel, \u0112oh shows up in j\u00efslheard (\u16e1\u16c7\u16cb\u16da\u16bb\u16e0\u16b1\u16de) on the Dover Stone. As a consonant, \u0112oh shows up in alme\u00efttig (\u16aa\u16da\u16d7\u16d6\u16c7\u16cf\u16cf\u16c1\u16b7) on the Ruthwell Cross. It is commonly transliterated as \u00ef. Although seemingly redundant in extant inscriptions, it is theorized that the rune may have originally stood for a long vowel somewhere around , continuing Proto-Indo-European language *. Another theory postulates the rune was originally a bindrune of \u16c1 and \u16c3, having the value of /ji/ and /ij/. Two variants of the word are reconstructed for Proto-Germanic, *\u012bhaz (*\u01132haz, PIE *), continued in Old English as \u0113oh (also \u012bh), and *\u012bwaz (*\u01132waz, Proto-Indo- European *), continued in Old English as \u012bw (whence yew). The latter is possibly an early loan from the Celtic, compare Gaulish ivos, Breton ivin, Welsh ywen, Old Irish \u0113o. The common spelling of the rune's name, \"Eihwaz\", combines the two variants; strictly based on the Old English evidence, a spelling \"Eihaz\" would be more proper. The Anglo-Saxon rune poem: : Eoh by\u00fe utan unsme\u00fee treo\u01bf, : heard hrusan f\u00e6st, hyrde fyres, : \u01bfyrtrumun under\u01bfre\u00feyd, \u01bfyn on e\u00fele. : The yew is a tree with rough bark, : hard and fast in the earth, supported by its roots, : a guardian of flame and a joy upon an estate. The rune is not to be confused with the Sowilo rune, which has a somewhat similar shape, or with Ehwaz, the rune expressing short e or \u01131. In the Younger Futhark, there is the terminal -R rune Yr \"yew\", but neither its shape nor its sound is related to the Eihwaz rune: it is, rather, a continuation of Algiz. ==See also== * Wolfsangel ==References== Category:Runes ",
