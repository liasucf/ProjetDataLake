    "text": "The 1949 Big Nine Conference football season was the 54th season of college football played by the member schools of the Big Nine Conference (also known as the Western Conference and the Big Ten Conference) and was a part of the 1949 college football season. Ohio State and Michigan tied for the 1949 Big Ten championship. Ohio State, under head coach Wes Fesler, compiled a 7\u20131\u20132 record and was ranked No. 6 in the final AP Poll. The Buckeyes defeated California in the 1950 Rose Bowl by a 17\u201314 score. Center Jack Lininger was selected as the team's most valuable player. Michigan, under head coach Bennie Oosterbaan, compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record and was ranked No. 7 in the final AP Poll. The Wolverines had a 25-game win streak broken with a loss to Army on October 8, 1949. Halfback Dick Kempthorn was selected as the team's most valuable player, and tackle Alvin Wistert was a consensus first-team All-American. Minnesota, under head coach Bernie Bierman, finished in third place, compiled a 7\u20132 record, led the conference in both scoring offense (25.7 points per game) and scoring defense (8.9 points allowed per game), and was ranked No. 8 in the final AP Poll. Bud Grant and John Lundin were selected as the team's most valuable players. Tackle Leo Nomellini and center Clayton Tonnemaker were both consensus first-team All-Americans. ==Preseason== After the University of Chicago formally withdrew from the Big Ten Conference in 1946, conference officials began considering other schools to fill the vacancy. In December 1948, conference officials voted unanimously to admit Michigan State College, selecting the Spartans over a competing bid from the University of Pittsburgh. The decision was certified in May 1949, with Spartans' participation slated to begin in the fall of 1950 with the exception of football where their participation was delayed until 1953. There was one coaching change between the 1948 and 1949 seasons. In December, 1948, Harry Stuhldreher resigned as Wisconsin's head football coach, though he retained his job as athletic director. In January, 1949, Wisconsin hired Ivy Williamson as its new head coach. Williamson had been a star football player at Michigan in the early 1930s and the head football coach at Lafayette from 1947 to 1948. ==Season overview== ===Results and team statistics=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !width=\"25\"|Conf.
