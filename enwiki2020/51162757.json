Its motto was \"Lest We Forget Continuing The Dream.\" Opening in 1938, the school closed in 1958. ==History== Lockland Wayne was located near the city limits of Cincinnati in Hamilton County. It is historically significant as having an all-black student class; all-black faculty, and all- black support staff. Alumni continue to hold reunions every two years. Before the school opened its doors, the students attended Lockland High School. Many of the students walked to school from Lockland and neighboring Lincoln Heights and Woodlawn; some children walked to school. The black residents wanted a high school for many reasons but most of all to ensure their children had the best opportunity to learn in an environment which fosters excellence in academia, sports, drama, music, and throughout all areas of the school's curriculum with teachers who looked like them. In the last summer of 1936 residents of Lockland voted to approve a $55,000 Bond Issue and received an additional $45,000 from a Federal Grant to build and extension to the old Wayne School building. Lockland Wayne High School 1938\u20131958 graduated the first class of students in 1941. The school building was an extension of the old Wayne elementary school with 12 classrooms with an auditorium which doubles as a gymnasium. ==Sports== ===First All-African American boys basketball state championship=== The 1952 Lockland-Wayne Panthers was the first all African-American boys basketball team to win a state championship.
