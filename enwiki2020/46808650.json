The CR emerged in May 2015 from a split from Forza Italia (FI), and is modelled on the British Conservative Party and David Cameron's brand of liberal conservatism, vision and leadership (in the run-up to the 2015 UK general election Fitto, Capezzone and other 28 MPs of their faction within FI had publicly endorsed Cameron in a letter to The Telegraph)Letters: Voters want politicians to stop hiding the facts about debt - Telegraph and named after the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), the group in the European Parliament in which the Conservatives and Fitto sit. The CR joined the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) on 13 November 2015. Since January 2017 the CR have been part of a new party named Direction Italy (DI), also led by Fitto. ==History== ===Forza Italia's Rebuilders=== In November 2013 The People of Freedom, the centre-right party led by Silvio Berlusconi, was transformed into Forza Italia (FI), a reference to a defunct party with the same name. Among the strongest supporters of the return to FI, the so-called \"hawks\" and self-proclaimed \"loyalists\", a leading role was played by Raffaele Fitto. At the 2014 European Parliament election Fitto was FI's most voted candidate and was elected to the European Parliament in the South. Fitto, the strongest backer of Berlusconi's leadership in late 2013, became his main internal challenger by mid 2014. After months of bickering with Berlusconi over the so- called \"Nazareno pact\" with Matteo Renzi, leader of the Democratic Party and Prime Minister, in February 2015 Fitto launched his own faction, named \"Rebuilders\". Fitto's allies included Capezzone, Maurizio Bianconi, Rocco Palese, Saverio Romano, Cinzia Bonfrisco, Augusto Minzolini and most Apulian MPs. ===Split from Forza Italia=== In the run-up of the 2015 regional elections Berlusconi and Fitto did not find an agreement on the composition of the slates in Apulia, where the party's two wings fielded two opposing candidates for president. At the 2015 Apulian regional election a list named after Fitto (\"Beyond with Fitto\") won 9.3% of the vote and its candidate for president, Francesco Schittulli (Schittulli Political Movement), won 18.3% of the president's vote (won by Michele Emiliano, a Democrat), compared to 10.8% for FI and 14.4% for FI's official candidate and former member of the Brothers of Italy (FdI), Adriana Poli Bortone.Puglia - Elezioni Regionali - 31 maggio 2015 - la Repubblica.it Two weeks before the regional elections, Fitto left the European People's Party Group in the European Parliament in order to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR).Archivio Corriere della Sera He also left FI altogether and launched the Conservatives and Reformists (CR). At its launch, the CR included nine deputies (eight sitting with FI and one with the FdI)Fi: gruppo Camera fa i conti, ipotesi scissione Fitto 'vale' 1 mln euro and twelve senators (ten from FI and two from Great Autonomies and Freedom, GAL), organised in an official group;senato.it - Composizione del Gruppo Conservatori e Riformisti nella XVII Legislatura two senators later defected to the Liberal Popular Alliance (ALA),Archivio Corriere della Sera but the remaining ten senators were enough to keep the senatorial group alive. In early July the CR were joined by an additional MEP, Remo Sernagiotto, who had defected from FI and the EPP to ECR.Remo Sernagiotto MEP joins the ECR Group : European Conservatives and Reformists Group The CR were established as a full-fledged political party on 16 July 2015.Conservatori, Fitto lancia il simbolo: \u00abSiamo nel centrodestra, ma no ad accordi poco chiari\u00bb - Il Sole 24 OREEcco il Leone Blu dei Conservatori e Riformisti.
