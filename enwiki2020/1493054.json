    "text": "Alejandro Selkirk Island (), previously known as M\u00e1s Afuera (Farther Out (to Sea)) and renamed after the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk, is the largest and most westerly island in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Archipelago of the Valpara\u00edso Region of Chile. It is situated west of Robinson Crusoe Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The Archipelago was home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk from 1704 to 1709, and is thought to have inspired novelist Daniel Defoe's fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel about the character (although the novel is explicitly set in the Caribbean, not in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands). This was just one of several survival stories from the period that Defoe would have been aware of. To reflect the literary lore associated with the island and attract tourists, the Chilean government renamed the place Alejandro Selkirk Island in 1966. == Geography == A view of Alejandro Selkirk Island The Masafuera rayadito is endemic to Alejandro Selkirk The extinct Alejandro Selkirk firecrown, Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi The island measures north\u2013south and east\u2013west, and has an area of . It is densely wooded and very mountainous and is marked by ridges and numerous deep ravines lead to a steep, rugged coast on the east side of the island off which are tremendous depths. The coastal cliffs are up to high. The south, west and north sides of the island have sandy strips of beach which extend offshore in places. The highest peak, Cerro de Los Inocentes, rises to in the southwest part of Alejandro Selkirk Island, where there is also a prominent rock with a hole through it. Landing is possible near the center of the east shore at Quebrada S\u00e1nchez (S\u00e1nchez Ravine), and at the foot of Quebrada Las Casas (La Casas Ravine) ), where there is a boat slip and buildings of the former penal colony. Anchorage can be taken about east-northeast of Quebrada S\u00e1nchez (), in depths of to . The ravine is recognized by a white patch on a hill near it. Anchorage can also be taken, in depths of to , with sand bottom, off Rada de la Colonia.Sailing Directions Enroute, Vol. 125, West Coast of South America Dating of rocks on the island show that it is the youngest of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands at an age of 1 \u2013 2 million years old. Due to its young age, the island shows little evidence of erosion. According to some early reports, now disputed, about southwest of the island is the submerged Sefton Reef (), almost reaching sea level, and to northwest, Yosemite Rock (). Podesta Island, once reported to lay farther to the west, is a phantom island. ==Climate== Alejandro Selkirk has a subtropical climate, moderated by the cold Humboldt Current and the southeast trade winds. Temperatures range from to , with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler. Average annual precipitation is , varying from to year to year. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above experience almost daily rainfall. == Flora and fauna == The Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal is known to have existed during the late 17th century on the island with the population of the seals on Alejandro Selkirk Island and Robinson Crusoe Island believed to be in excess of four million by the late 17th century. A census of 1797 estimated a population 2 \u2013 3 million fur seals. The species was hunted to near extinction by the 19th century and was thought to be extinct for 100 years until 200 were found on the island in 1965. Since then, the population has grown steadily at 15% to 20% every year. The Masafuera rayadito is endemic to Alejandro Selkirk and one of the rarest South American birds with only 140 individuals left.Gonzalez J. (2014).

The Alejandro Selkirk firecrown Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi an endemic subspecies of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez firecrown became extinct in 1908 by feral goats and other introduced animals. The flora on the island is in the Fernandezian Region Floristic Region, in the Antarctic Floristic Kingdom, but often also included within the Neotropical Kingdom. Endemic plant families include Lactoridaceae, with endemic plant genera also found. == History == Throughout much of its history, the island has been uninhabited. There was formerly a penal settlement along the middle of the east coast, at . About 20 buildings can be made out on detailed satellite images.Satellite image The settlement was operative from 1909. It initially housed 190 criminals, while there were as many as 160 political prisoners from 1927 to 1930. The penal colony was abandoned in 1930. Recently, the island has seen regular settlement, with 57 people living on the island as of the 2012 census. In 1966 the Chilean government renamed Isla M\u00e1s Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island, with Isla M\u00e1s a Tierra becoming Robinson Crusoe Island. Alexander Selkirk was a Scottish sailor who was marooned as a castaway on M\u00e1s a Tierra (then uninhabited) from 1704 to 1709. His story of survival likely inspired the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. ==In popular culture== The author Jonathan Franzen wrote an essay in The New Yorker about his brief stay on the island while mourning the suicide of his friend and fellow author David Foster Wallace, some of whose ashes Franzen scattered on the island. ==See also== *Flora of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands *Endemic flora of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands *Endemic fauna of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands ==References== ==External links== * Robinson Crusoe, Moai statues and the Rapa Nui: the stories of Chile\u2019s far-off islands *Geographical names on Alejandro Selkirk Island *Patagonia documentary about the island, Los Plastico Category:Islands of Valpara\u00edso Region Category:Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands ",
