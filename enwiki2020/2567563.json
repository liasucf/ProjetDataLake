    "text": "Ahmet Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek (May 26, 1904 - May 25, 1983) was a Turkish poet, novelist, playwright, and Islamist ideologue. He is also known simply by his initials NFK. He was noticed by the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who later became his teacher. ==Biography== Necip Faz\u0131l in 1916 In his own words, he was born in \"a huge mansion in \u00c7emberlita\u015f, on one of the streets descending towards Sultanahmet\" in 1904. His father was Abd\u00fclbaki Faz\u0131l Bey who held several posts including deputy judge in Bursa, public prosecutor in Gebze and finally, judge in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y. His mother was an emigree from Crete. He was raised at the \u00c7emberlita\u015f mansion of his paternal grandfather K\u0131sak\u00fcrekzade Mehmed Hilmi Efendi of Mara\u015f; he was named after his great- grandfather Ahmed Necib, as well as his father, Faz\u0131l. He studied in many schools during his primary education, including the French School in Gedikpa\u015fa, Robert College of Istanbul, as well as the Naval School. He received religious courses from Ahmed Hamdi of Akseki and science courses from Yahya Kemal at the Naval School but he was actually influenced by \u0130brahim A\u015fk\u00ee, whom he defined to have \"penetrated into deep and private areas in many inner and outer sciences from literature and philosophy to mathematics and physics\". \u0130brahim A\u015fk\u00ee provided his first contact with Sufism even at a \"plan of skin over skin\". \"After completing candidate and combat classes\" of Naval School, K\u0131sak\u00fcrek entered the Philosophy Department of Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn and graduated from there (1921\u20131924). One of his closest friends in philosophy was Hasan Ali Y\u00fccel. He studied in Paris for one year with the scholarship provided by the Ministry of National Education (1924\u20131925), until the scholarship was cancelled. After returning home in 1926, he worked at Holland, Osmanl\u0131 and \u0130\u015f Banks (1926\u20131939), and gave lectures at the Faculty of Linguistics and History and Geography and the State Conservatoire in Ankara and the Academy of Fine Arts in \u0130stanbul (1939\u20131942). Having established a relation with the press in his youth, K\u0131sak\u00fcrek quit civil service to earn his living from writing and magazines. Necip Faz\u0131l's life took a turn in 1934, when he met Abd\u00fclhakim Arvasi, a sheik of the Sufi Naqshbandi order. He became one of his most notable disciples, remaining a follower until the sheik's death in 1943. Appropriating his anti-semitic ideas from Europe, K\u0131sak\u00fcrek regarded Jews as the corrupting element within Western civilization, and described them as the originator of Marxism and capitalism. He held them responsible for the early conflicts between Muslims and the decline of the Ottoman Empire. K\u0131sak\u00fcrek's publications included the Turkish translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and praise for Henry Ford's The International Jew, as well as a political program in which he wrote: \u201cChief among these treacherous and insidious elements to be cleansed are the D\u00f6nmes and the Jews.\"Marc David Baer. \"An Enemy Old and New: The D\u00f6nme, Anti- Semitism, and Conspiracy Theories in the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic\". Jewish Quarterly Review 103.4 (2013): pp. 523\u2013555. Project MUSE. Web. 12 Aug. 2014. Necip Faz\u0131l was awarded the First Prize of C.H.P. Play Contest in 1947 with his play Sab\u0131r Ta\u015f\u0131 (Stone of Patience). K\u0131sak\u00fcrek was awarded the titles of \"Great Cultural Gift\" by the Ministry of Culture (25 May 1980) and \"Greatest Living Poet of Turkish\" by the Foundation of Turkish Literature upon the 75th anniversary of his birth. Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek died on 25 May 1983 in his house at Erenk\u00f6y after an illness that \"lasted long but did not impair his intellectual activity and writing\" and was buried in the graveyard at the Ey\u00fcp Cemetery on the ridge of Ey\u00fcp after an eventful funeral. ==Islamist nationalist ideology== K\u0131sak\u00fcrek sought to replace the Kemalist secular notion of nationalism by an Islamist one. Within Turkish Islamism, he represented the concept of \"Islamization from above\" through the capture of government. Since the late 1970s, K\u0131sak\u00fcrek has been an icon for Turkish Islamists. Many cadres of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) have been inspired by his rhetoric, including Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who met K\u0131sak\u00fcrek while still a student and attended his funeral at the start of his political career. ==Literary career== In his own words, having \"learned to read and to write from his grandfather in very young ages\", K\u0131sak\u00fcrek became \"crazy about limitless, trivia reading\" until the age of twelve starting from \"groups of sentences belonging to lower class writers of the French\" Having been involved in literature with such a reading passion, Necip Faz\u0131l states that his \"poetry started at the age of twelve\" and that his mother said \"how much I would like you to be a poet\" by showing the \"poetry notebook of a girl with tuberculosis\" lying on the bed next to his mother's bed when he went to visit her staying at the hospital, and adds: \"My mother's wish appeared to me as something that I fed inside but I was not aware of until twelve. The motive of existence itself. I decided inside with my eyes on the snow hurling on the window of the hospital room and the wind howling; I will be a poet! And I became\". The first published poem of Necip Faz\u0131l is \"Kitabe\", a poem that was later included in his book \u00d6r\u00fcmcek A\u011f\u0131 (Spider Web) with the title \"Bir Mezar Ta\u015f\u0131\"(A Gravestone); it was also published in the Yeni Mecmua (New Magazine) dated 1 July 1923. By 1939, his poems and articles were appearing in magazines such as Yeni Mecmua, Milli Mecmua, Anadolu, Hayat and Varl\u0131k, and Cumhuriyet newspaper. After returning home from Paris in 1925, Necip Faz\u0131l stayed in Ankara intermittently. On his third visit, he published a magazine called A\u011fa\u00e7 on 14 March 1936 by providing the support of some banks. A\u011fa\u00e7, the writers of which included Ahmet Hamdi Tanp\u0131nar, Ahmet Kutsi Tecer and Mustafa \u015eekip Tun\u00e7, decided to follow a spiritualist and idealist line on the contrary to the materialist and Marxian ideas supported by the writers such as Burhan Belge, Vedat Nedim T\u00f6r, \u015eevket S\u00fcreyya Aydemir and \u0130smail Husrev T\u00f6kin of closed Kadro magazine owned by Yakup Kadri and which influenced the intellectuals of the time greatly. K\u0131sak\u00fcrek later transferred to A\u011fa\u00e7 (Tree) magazine published during six volumes in Ankara to \u0130stanbul, however, unable to establish a viable reader base, the magazine was closed at the 17th volume. Necip Faz\u0131l next began to publish the magazine called B\u00fcy\u00fck Do\u011fu (Great East). Starting in 1943, the magazine was published intermittently as weekly, daily and monthly. In 1978, he was prosecuted because of his controversial articles and publications and the magazine was forced to close. Necip Faz\u0131l also published a political humor magazine called Borazan (Bugle), of which only three volumes were published. ==Bibliography== ===Poetry=== * \u00d6r\u00fcmcek A\u011f\u0131 (1925) (Spider Web) * Kald\u0131r\u0131mlar (1928) (Pavements) * Ben ve \u00d6tesi (1932) (Me and Beyond) * Sonsuzluk Kervan\u0131 (1955) (Caravan of Infinity) * \u00c7ile I (1962) (Anguish I) * \u015eiirlerim (My poems) (1969) * Essel\u00e2m (1973) (Welcome) * \u00c7ile II (1974) (Anguish II) * Bu Ya\u011fmur (This Rain) * Can\u0131m \u0130stanbul (My Dear Istanbul) ===Novels=== * Aynadaki Yalan (1980) (The Lie in the Mirror) * Kafa Ka\u011f\u0131d\u0131 (1984-Published as a series in Milliyet newspaper) ===Stories=== * Birka\u00e7 Hik\u00e2ye Birka\u00e7 Tahlil (1932) (Some Stories and Some Analyses) * Ruh Burkuntular\u0131ndan Hikayeler (1964) (Stories From Soul Shatters) * Hik\u00e2yelerim (1970) (My Stories) ===Memoirs=== * Cinnet Mustatili (1955) (Rectangle of the Possessed) * Hac (1973) (Hajj) * O ve Ben (1974) (He and I) * B\u00e2b\u0131\u00e2li (1975) (The Sublime Porte) ===Plays=== * Bir Adam Yaratmak (To Create A Man) * Tohum (Seed) * Reis Bey (Mr. Judge) * Para (Money) * Sab\u0131r Ta\u015f\u0131 (Stone of Patience) * Ah\u015fap Konak (Wooden Mansion) * Kanl\u0131 Sar\u0131k (Bloody Turban) * P\u00fcf Noktas\u0131 (The Thin Line) * \u0130brahim Ethem * Yunus Emre * Abd\u00fclhamin Han (Abdulhamid Khan) * Mukaddes Emanet (The Holy Escrow) * Siyah Pelerinli Adam (The Man With Black Cloak) * Parmaks\u0131z Salih (Fingerless Salih) ==See also== * List of contemporary Turkish poets ==References== * Biyografi.net - Biography of Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek * Antoloji.com - Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek : Selected poetry * Biyografi.info - Biography of Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek * Yrd.Do\u00e7.Dr.Adem \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan, \u201cNecip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek\u2019in \u2018\u00c7ile\u2019 Adl\u0131 \u015eiiri ve \u00c7\u00f6z\u00fcmlemesi / Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek's Poem \u2018\u00c7ile\u2019 (Anguish) and Its Analysis\", Uluslararas\u0131 Sosyal Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar Dergisi / The Journal of International Social Research, Volume: 9, Issue: 42, February 2016, pp. 68\u2013107. ==External links== * Necipfazil.com - A website dedicated to Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek * Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek's Life and Works * Necip Faz\u0131l K\u0131sak\u00fcrek * * Listen NFK Category:1904 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Turkish male poets Category:Turkish male writers Category:Turkish anti-communists Category:Turkish Islamists Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Burials at Ey\u00fcp Cemetery Category:20th-century Turkish poets Category:Antisemitism in Turkey Category:Islamic nationalism ",
