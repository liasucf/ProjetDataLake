In the late 1990s, the town government embarked on a campaign to make Tohma the number one \"sports town\" in Japan. While bubble-era funding eventually dried up, a number of first rate sports facilities and tourist attractions are still in operation today. Among these are a campground, large children's obstacle course, tennis courts, soccer, baseball and softball fields, park golf course, ski slope (beginner level with 1 rope lift only) and sports center. In addition, the town is also home to the Papillion Chateau insect museum, the T\u014dma Sh\u014dny\u016bd\u014d Limestone Cave (one of the few in Hokkaido), and Healthy Chateau, a medium-sized hot spring. ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ",
