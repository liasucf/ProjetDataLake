    "text": "Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1876 (with one state in 1877) for Representatives to the 45th Congress. These elections coincided with the (heavily contested) election of President Rutherford B. Hayes and the United States Centennial. Hayes' Republican Party was able to recover from the Democratic Party many of the seats it had lost two years before as the economy improved slightly. However, the Democrats retained a majority and were able to use the disinterest of the people in Republican Reconstruction-led projects to help keep crucial seats. Republican Congressional leadership had a difficult time distancing itself from the corruption of the Grant administration or the legislature's impact on the economy downturn. ==Election summaries== {| style=\"width:100%; text- align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white\" | style=\"background:; width:53.58%\" | 157 | style=\"background:; width:46.42%\" | 136 |- | Democratic | Republican |} {| class=wikitable |- valign=bottom !

This law did not affect election dates for Congress, which remained within the jurisdiction of State governments, but over time, the States moved their Congressional elections to this date as well. In 1876\u201377, there were still 8 states with earlier election dates, and 1 state with a later election date. * Early elections (1876): ** June 5 Oregon ** September 5 Vermont ** September 11 Maine ** October 4 #Georgia ** October 10 Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, West Virginia * Late election (1877): ** March 13, 1877 New Hampshire == Special elections == {| class=wikitable |- ! rowspan=2 | District ! colspan=3 | Incumbent ! colspan=2 | This race |- !
