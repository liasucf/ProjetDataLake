It's a refreshingly original sound, but there's an undeniable pop sensibility that still makes it palatable to radio programmers and, as it turns out, the general public.\" Chris from Indie Music Filters said: \"[Do You Remember] feels like a tastefully subdued cousin of AWOLNation's hit 'Sail', plucked strings and deliberate percussion building to an excellent chorus.\" This song was featured in Western Sydney University's (formally the University of Western Sydney) ads around the August\u2013September 2015 period to promote its rebranding. ==Track listing== One-track single # \"Do You Remember\" Digital remix single # \"Do You Remember\" (featuring Raury) Remix EP # \"Do You Remember\" (Noah Breakfast Remix) \u2013 3:41 # \"Do You Remember\" (Chet Porter Remix) \u2013 4:35 # \"Do You Remember\" (Smle Remix) \u2013 4:00 # \"Do You Remember\" (Mel\u00e9 Remix) \u2013 4:21 # \"Do You Remember\" (Strange Talk Remix) \u2013 5:07 Digital remix single # \"Do You Remember\" (featuring Grey Remix) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Independent Singles (AIR) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 22 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia Urban (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|5 |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
