The station is a National Public Radio affiliate and is located on Bradley's campus. WCBU first signed on in 1970. In 2007, WCBU became the first radio station in Central Illinois to offer a second channel of separate classical programming for listeners with HD Radio receivers. In April 2019, Illinois State University and Bradley University signed an agreement in which WGLT assumed operations of WCBU starting June 1, 2019. WCBU will continue to run broadcast operations on the Bradley campus and will keep the WCBU call letters and 89.9 FM frequency. ISU will manage WCBU\u2019s personnel operations. WGLT\u2019s translator signal at 103.5 FM in Peoria, which had simulcast WGLT\u2019s signal, will simulcast WCBU-HD2\u2019s classical music format.WGLT To Assume Operations At Peoria Public Radio Station WCBU ==Programming== WCBU, Peoria Public Radio offers a wide variety of news and music programs on both its main and HD channels.

Programs from that period included \"Why Did They Come?\" a historical review of the original settlers of the Peoria River Valley. \"Why Did They Come?\" blended original insight with the radio dramatization. Other locally produced programs included \"Pipes on the Prairie\" produced and hosted by Terry Solomonson, which featured recordings of historic pipe organs from throughout central and southern Illinois and \"The Duke Knight Radio Hour.\" \"The Duke Knight Radio Hour\" featured bluegrass and folk artists from around Central Illinois. It became a very popular program and attracted a large radio and live audience. Local musical favorites Applegate and Company, featuring brothers Bob and Dick Applegate, Rich Mitts and Bill Harlan were regulars on the program, which was broadcast live from the Dingeldine Auditorium on Saturday nights. The Non- Commercial Arts and Storage Company, composed of members of Bradley University's nationally recognized speech team, provided comedy sketches and satire. ===WCBU2=== In January 2007, WCBU created a second channel, WCBU2, to listeners with HD radios or access to internet streaming. The original programming concept of WCBU2 was to counter WCBU's main channel programming. If WCBU is airing a news or talk show, WCBU HD2 would be airing music and vice versa. Streaming of WCBU HD2 officially began on February 15, 2007. In March 2011, WCBU programming switched to all news, information, public affairs and entertainment on the main channel (WCBU HD1) and full-time classical music on WCBU HD2, now known as Classical WCBU HD2.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=18 HD Radio Guide for Peoria, Illinois As of 2019, the classical station also airs on 103.5 FM, the former translator signal of WGLT. ==WCBU News== The WCBU news department includes News Director Tim Shelley, reporters Joe Deacon and Kristin McHugh, and producer/anchor Daniel Musisi. Since 1999, WCBU News has won several national, regional and state awards for journalistic excellence. ==References== ==External links== *Official website ** WCBU main program schedule ** WCBU2 program schedule ** WCBU Facebook page **WCBU Twitter page * *Location of WCBU Studios on Wikimapia Category:Bradley University Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States CBU Category:NPR member stations CBU Category:Radio stations established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Illinois ",
