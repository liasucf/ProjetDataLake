    "text": "Ginger Baker's Air Force 2 was the second and final album by Ginger Baker's Air Force, released in 1970. In Germany, Australia and New Zealand it was released with a different track listing, including previously unreleased songs. This album was recorded in a studio, unlike the previous one, featuring a different lineup of the band, with Denny Laine, Harold McNair, Aliki Ashman, and Ric Grech as \"Additional personnel\". Graham Bond took lead vocal duties along with Ginger Baker, Diane Stewart and Catherine James. The album cover was designed left-handed; i.e. with the front cover printed on what traditionally would be considered the back and vice versa. ==Track listing== ===UK version=== # \"Let Me Ride\" (Roebuck Staples) \u2013 4:22 # \"Sweet Wine\" (Ginger Baker, Janet Godfrey) \u2013 3:34 # \"Do U No Hu Yor Phrenz R?\" (Baker) \u2013 5:40 # \"We Free Kings\" (Baker) \u2013 4:22 # \"I Don't Want to Go on Without You\" (Bert Berns, Jerry Wexler) \u2013 3:56 # \"Toady\" (Baker) \u2013 9:45 # \"12 Gates of the City\" (Graham Bond) \u2013 4:05 ===German, French, Australian and New Zealand version=== # \"We Free Kings\" \u2013 Alternate take (Baker) \u2013 4:57 # \"Caribbean Soup\" (Harold McNair) \u2013 3:10 # \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (Jack Bruce, Pete Brown, Eric Clapton) \u2013 5:49 # \"You Wouldn't Believe It\" (Denny Laine, Baker) \u2013 3:42 # \"You Look Like You Could Use a Rest\" (Rick Grech) \u2013 3:42 # \"Sweet Wine\" (Baker, Godfrey) \u2013 3:34 # \"I Don't Want to Go on Without You\" (Berns, Wexler) \u2013 3:56 # \"Let Me Ride\" (Roebuck Staples) \u2013 4:23 ==Personnel== *Ginger Baker \u2013 drums, timpani, tubular bells, African drums, vocals *Ken Craddock \u2013 guitars, Hammond organ, piano, vocals *Colin Gibson \u2013 bass guitar *Graham Bond \u2013 alto saxophone, Hammond organ, piano, vocals *Steve Gregory \u2013 tenor saxophone, flutes *Bud Beadle \u2013 baritone, alto & tenor saxophones *Diane Stewart \u2013 vocals *Catherine James \u2013 vocals *Neemoi \"Speedy\" Acquaye \u2013 drums, percussion, African drums Additional personnel *Denny Laine \u2013 guitars, piano, vocals *Rick Grech \u2013 bass guitar *Harold McNair \u2013 tenor & alto saxophones, flutes *Aliki Ashman \u2013 vocals *Rocky Dzidzornu \u2013 percussion, conga ==References== Category:1970 albums Category:Ginger Baker's Air Force albums Category:Polydor Records albums Category:Atco Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ginger Baker Category:Albums produced by Ric Grech Category:Albums produced by Danny Laine Category:Albums produced by Graham Bond Category:Albums recorded at Trident Studios Category:Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios ",
