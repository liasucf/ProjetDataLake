KTVN's studios are located on Energy Way in Reno, and its transmitter is located on Slide Mountain between SR 431 and I-580/US 395/US 395 ALT in unincorporated Washoe County (on a tower shared with NBC affiliate KRNV-DT, channel 4, and dual ABC/CW+ affiliate KOLO-TV, channel 8). On cable, KTVN is available on Charter Spectrum channel 2 and in high definition on digital channel 782. ==History== KTVN signed on the air on June 4, 1967 as an ABC affiliate owned by Washoe Empire. It took over the CBS affiliation on May 10, 1972, replacing previous affiliate KOLO-TV. During the 1970s, the station operated a satellite station, KEKO-TV (channel 10) in Elko. KEKO signed on April 18, 1973; it was off-the-air from January 24, 1974 to June 27, 1975. On December 23, 1975, Washoe Empire informed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that KEKO's transmitter and equipment had been destroyed in a fire; on April 14, 1976, the FCC granted special temporary authority (STA) to Washoe Empire to operate a KTVN translator on channel 10 (at the time, Washoe Empire had made no decision about returning KEKO to the air). On April 8, 1977, at the station's request, the FCC canceled the KEKO license effective March 18. Channel 10 in Elko is currently used by KENV-DT, which formerly operated as a satellite of KRNV-DT until its disaffiliation from NBC on January 1, 2018; it is now a Comet TV-operated station. Sarkes Tarzian bought KTVN from Washoe Empire for $12.5 million in 1980. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Channel !Video !Aspect !PSIP Short Name !Programming |- | 2.1 || 1080i || 16:9 || KTVN-DT || Main KTVN programming / CBS |- | 2.2 || rowspan=2|480i || 4:3 || KTVN-2 || Light TV |- | 2.3 || 16:9 || KTVN-3 || Ion Television |- |} ===Analog-to-digital conversion=== KTVN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2. ==Programming== In addition to the CBS network schedule, syndicated programming on KTVN includes The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Inside Edition, among others. ==News operation== KTVN is the only station in the Reno market to not have a midday newscast. KTVN airs the CBS Evening News at 6:00 p.m. and KOLO-TV also airs their national newscast at 6:00 p.m. while KRNV is the only station to air their national newscast at 5:30 p.m. Other newscasts include a two and a half hour long 2 News This Morning that runs from 4:30\u20137:00 a.m. and 2 News at 4:00, 4:30, 5:00, 5:30, 6:30, 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. KOLO-TV began competing with KTVN on the 4:30 a.m. newscast which debuted on October 13, 2014. ===Notable former on-air staff=== * Jodi Applegate * Mike Galanos * Tony Kovaleski * Richard Labunski * Kurtis Ming * Rene Syler * Elizabeth Vargas ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:CBS network affiliates Category:Light TV affiliates Category:Ion Television subchannel- only affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Nevada TVN ",
