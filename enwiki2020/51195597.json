    "text": "G\u00e9rard Du Doyer de Gastels (29 April 1732 \u2013 10 April 1798) was an 18th-century French poet and playwright. == Biography == The son of a councilor by the Accounting Chamber and brother of an adviser to Parlement, the Marquis Du Doyer served for fifteen years in the regiment of Aunis which he left to become an oratorian. He remained seven years at the Oratory and became a Jansenist and a zealous convulsionnaire then left the community with feelings that made him consider favorably by the Encyclop\u00e9distes. He devoted himself to the study of science and neglected none, since he had studied theology at the Oratory, to chemistry and mathematics. Frequent readings he made of Bayle completed his drive to skepticism and he eventually believed nothing without mathematical evidence. He was only twenty-two when Claude Joseph Dorat had the opportunity to introduce him to mademoiselle Deligny, young actress of the Theatre fran\u00e7ais. Du Doyer doted on her, and addressed her an epistle in verse, which was printed in the 1766 edition of the Almanach des Muses. Having married her, he composed some plays and lived to the age of 65, still in love with her and always happy, although other records indicate that they did not live in such close intimacy. Dudoyer had several plays presented at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise: * Laurette, two-act comedy in free verse, played 14 September 1768 ; * le Vindicatif, drama in 5 acts and in free verse, 1774, in-8\u00b0, which had several presentations ; *Ad\u00e9la\u00efde ou l\u2019Antipathie contre l\u2019amour, comedy in 2 acts and in ten syllables verse, 1780, in-8\u00b0;\"A triffle, said Laharpe, whose bottom, it is true, is very worn, but that is written with ease, sometimes with grace, and of with few details and the actors' performances made pretty much the merit.\" \u0152uvres de Jean Fran\u00e7ois de La Harpe, accompagn\u00e9es d'une notice sur sa vie et sur ses ouvrages (avec des estampes), vol.11, Paris, Verdi\u00e8re, 1820, 499 pages, (p. 289\u201390). * Several of his poems were inserted in the Almanach des Muses ; he left several manuscripts, among which a tragedy whose title and subject are unknown. == Notes == == Sources == * * * == External links == * G\u00e9rard Dudoyer de Gastels on data.bnf.fr Category:18th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century French poets Category:18th-century male writers Category:1732 births Category:1798 deaths ",
