    "text": "John Helm Grim (August 9, 1867 \u2013 July 28, 1961) was a 19th-century Major League Baseball player. Born in Lebanon, Kentucky, he played 11 seasons in the majors, mainly as a catcher. ==Career== Although he played in two games for the 1888 Philadelphia Quakers, Grim's career really started when he joined the Rochester Broncos of the American Association in 1890. He would play sparingly for the Broncos and the Milwaukee Brewers in 1891. It wasn't until he joined the Louisville Colonels in 1892, that he became the starting catcher. He played three seasons with Louisville, enjoying his best season in 1894 when he batted .298 with 7 home runs and 70 RBIs. Grim played his final five seasons with the Brooklyn Grooms/Bridegrooms/Superbas with moderate success. In 11 seasons, he batted .267, drove in 330 runs and hit 16 home runs. He pitched one game, and even umpired three games. ==Post career== Grim died in Indianapolis, Indiana at the age of 93, and was interred at Crown Hill Cemetery. ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Milwaukee Brewers (AA) players Category:Philadelphia Quakers players Category:Rochester Broncos players Category:Louisville Colonels players Category:Brooklyn Grooms players Category:Brooklyn Bridegrooms players Category:Brooklyn Superbas players Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Baseball players from Kentucky Category:People from Lebanon, Kentucky Category:Burials at Crown Hill Cemetery Category:Danville Browns players Category:Lima Lushers players Category:Toronto Canucks players Category:Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) players Category:St. Joseph Saints players Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players ",
