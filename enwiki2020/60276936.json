By the time she was six her parents had agreed that they planned to marry her to the boy who would be the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. This could have been a classic arranged marriage but the betrothed were in contact by age 14 and they were keen to become partners. Her mother was an enthusiastic manager of the plantations and hundreds of slaves that they owned in Jamaica. Her mother's first husband had been Roger Hope Elletson (1723-1775), Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica,, UCL Department of History 2020. who had left her mother the Hope Plantation. He owned the 600 acre Merrymans Hill plantation in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica and 93 enslaved people in 1753. They married in 1775 and he had died the same year leaving her as an absentee manager. Her husband, Richard Temple-Nugent- Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos proved to be a spendthrift and before she realised he had already disposed of some of her land despite this being in contravention of her marriage settlement. She rearranged their finances and she is credited with saving the family from bankruptcy. Although her husband failed to lose all their money, her son Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos took after his father and managed to bring the family to bankruptcy in 1847.
