    "text": "Riga State Gymnasium No.1 (), the oldest school in the Baltic states, offers secondary education (grades 7 to 12) in Riga, the capital of Latvia. The school traces its origins to school of Riga Cathedral, which was founded in 1211, a decade after the foundation of Riga itself. Its name and language of instruction have changed several times during its history. Latvian became the main language of instruction in 1919. Today, the gymnasium is known for its strong programs in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science. Students wishing to enroll at the school take an admissions test in mathematics. Its admissions rate, with as many as nine candidates competing for each position, is one of the lowest in the country. Since 1997 the school enrolls 30 to 40 people in its International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme each year, where instruction is offered in English. It was the first school in the Baltic states to offer the IBO Diploma Programme. Each year a number of 12th grade students finish the DSD (Das Deutsches Sprachdiplom) programme by taking an exam along with the regular school leaving exams. Passing the exam enables them to pursue their higher education in German speaking countries. Riga State Gymnasium No.1 is consistently ranked first among the schools in Latvia. Its students' average results on school leaving (state) exams are the highest in the country. Riga State Gymnasium No.1 is also the best school in Latvia based on its students' achievements at various domestic and international academic competitions. Many of the graduates continue their education at highly ranked universities abroad, particularly in the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Austria and the USA. The percentage of these students is very high among the ones who graduate from the IBO Diploma Programme. == Notable alumni == *Agnis And\u017e\u0101ns \u2013 Latvian mathematician *Ingus Bau\u0161\u0137enieks \u2013 Latvian musician *Gun\u0101rs Birkerts \u2013 Latvian American architect *Uldis C\u0113rps \u2013 Chairman of the Financial and Capital Market Commission in Latvia *Tomass Dukurs \u2013 Latvian skeleton racer *Indulis Emsis \u2013 Latvian politician, former Prime Minister of Latvia *Andrejs \u0112rglis \u2013 Latvian cardiologist *Ingvars Vitenburgs \u2013 First Latvian to win three medals in three years at International Physics Olympiad *M\u0101ris Gailis \u2013 Latvian businessman, former Prime Minister of Latvia *Ivars Godmanis \u2013 Latvian politician, former Prime Minister of Latvia *Garlieb Merkel \u2013 Baltic German writer and activist *Wilhelm Ostwald \u2013 Baltic German Nobel Prize winning chemist *Friedrich Parrot \u2013 Baltic German naturalist and traveler *Kristjan Jaak Peterson \u2013 Estonian poet, commonly regarded as the founder of modern Estonian poetry *M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 P\u013cavi\u0146\u0161 \u2013 Latvian beach volleyball player, 2012 Olympic medalist *Krista Puisite \u2013 First Latvian golfer to earn LPGA Tour Card *M\u0101ris Purgailis \u2013 Latvian politician, former Mayor of Riga *Rainis \u2013 Latvian poet and politician *Einars Rep\u0161e \u2013 Latvian politician, former Prime Minister of Latvia *P\u0113teris Stu\u010dka \u2013 Latvian politician, head of the Bolshevik government in Latvia during the Latvian War of Independence *Daina Taimi\u0146a \u2013 Latvian mathematician *Justs Sirmais \u2013 Latvian representative to the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. ==See also== * List of the oldest schools in the world == References == == External links == *Riga State Gymnasium No.1 \u2013 Official site * \u2013 Deutsches Sprachdiplom Category:Educational institutions established in the 13th century Category:1211 establishments in Europe Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Latvia Category:Schools in Latvia Category:Education in Riga ",
