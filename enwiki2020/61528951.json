    "text": "The Government formation of 2019\u201320 started one day after the federal elections, regional elections and European elections which were all held simultaneously on 26 May 2019. These formations are only the second under King Philippe. During the formation period, no less than six new governments needed to be formed. Both a new Federal Government as well as new regional governments: a Flemish, Walloon, French Community, German Community and Brussels Government. The elections had shown again the big difference in voting preference between Wallonia (left) and Flanders (right), making it clear that forming a new Federal Government would not be easy. While the Government of the German-speaking Community was formed only a few days after the elections and the Brussels Government was formed one month later, the other regional governments were only formed after the summer, in September and October 2019. At the federal level, the deadlock was never resolved, but nevertheless, a new government was formed in March 2020. Its mission is only to fight against the coronavirus, as several of the opposing parties agreed to support a new Wilm\u00e8s II Government identical to the current caretaker Wilm\u00e8s I Government to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, de facto ending the search for a new government. The new government was given special powers to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. The powers expired on 27 June 2020. Efforts to form a coalition have continued during this time. The Wilm\u00e8s II government continues in office in the meantime, but would have to seek a new vote of confidence on 17 September 2020 in case a new coalition was not formed before then, although this period was further extended to 1 October 2020. ==Overview== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Government ! colspan=\"2\" | Outgoing coalition ! colspan=\"2\" | Next coalition !

For instance: the cdH had announced in the beginning of the formation it preferred to remain in the opposition, while extremist parties on both sides (left: Workers' Party of Belgium, right: Vlaams Belang) are unlikely to be part of the government due to vetoes by other parties. === Prior to the formation period === The outgoing federal government is the Michel II Government. King Philippe accepted the resignation of the federal government Michel II on 21 December 2018, already a few months priot to the election date.Koning aanvaardt het ontslag van Michel II, regering gaat in lopende zaken, VRT NWS, 21 December 2018. Reason was the early fall of the Michel I Government over to the Global Compact for Migration. Goal is to form a new federal government possessing over at least 76 of the 150 available seats in the Chamber of Representatives. The governing parties during the previous legislature, were punished by the voters, together losing 22 seats. N-VA lost eight seats, CD&V; and MR six seats each and Open Vld lost two. As a result, a renewed Swedish coalition (Michel I government contained party colours yellow (N-VA) and blue (liberal, i.e. MR and Open Vld) and the cross (Christianity, i.e. CD&V;), which are combined on the Swedish flag, hence the name) was impossible even if it was expanded with cdH, the Francophone counterpart of the CD&V;, which had not joined the government in 2014. cdH and the socialist opposition parties PS and sp.a were also on the losing side: cdH and sp.a lost four seats each whereas PS lost three. The big winners of the elections were the extremist left PVDA-PTB, gaining ten seats, and the extremist right Vlaams Belang, gaining fifteen seats. The green parties also gained, Ecolo went up five, while Groen saw a modest gain of two seats. Analists saw two possible coalitions: a socalled purple-yellow government with Flemish-nationalists N-VA, socialists and liberals; and a purple-green government with socialists, liberals and greens, possibly also with CD&V.; Both options were however very difficult to realize: purple-yellow has a majority in both language groups, but sees parties form a coalition which have very large political differences, most notably between socialists and N-VA.Paars-groen of paars-geel: welke bonte kleurencombinaties kan de federale regering krijgen?, VRT Nieuws, 6 November 2019. Moreover, the PS had stated on numerous occasions its preference for a purple-green government, while the N-VA only wanted to be in a government with PS in case large community reforms would be made, something which all Francophone parties were against. Purple-green however was difficult for other reasons: with only 76 of 150 seats the majority was very slim, making this uncomfortable while also having a minority in the Flemsh language group. Both Open Vld and CD&V; were not in favor of a Flemish minority as this would mean the two largest Flemish parties (N-VA and Vlaams Belang) would end up in the opposition, and as such both parties insisted that PS and N-VA sat together to form a government. The day after the election, King Philippe invited for an audience in turn Prime Minister of Belgium Charles Michel (MR), Senate president Jacques Brotchi (MR), Chamber of Representatives president Siegfried Bracke (N-VA), and party presidents Bart De Wever (N-VA) and Elio Di Rupo (PS). One day later, on 28 May 2019, the King met with Zakia Khattabi and Jean-Marc Nollet (Ecolo), Meyrem Almaci (Groen), Wouter Beke (CD&V;), Olivier Maingain (D\u00e9FI), Gwendolyn Rutten (Open Vld) and John Crombez (sp.a). On 29 May 2019, Maxime Pr\u00e9vot (cdH), Charles Michel (now as MR president), Tom Van Grieken (Vlaams Belang) and Peter Mertens (PVDA/PTB) were also invited. This meant that for the first time since the foundation of the Vlaams Blok in 1978, the predecessor of Vlaams Belang, a Belgian King invited a representative of this party as part of government negotiations. In 1978 Karel Dillen was invited by Baudouin, but he declined. The party had not been invited to the royal palace since.Vlaams Belang voor eerste keer uitgenodigd op het paleis: Tom Van Grieken straks op gesprek, Gazet van Antwerpen, 29 May 2019.Vlaams Belang-voorzitter Tom Van Grieken gaat voor het eerst op gesprek bij koning Filip, VRT NWS, 29 May 2019.Tom Van Grieken wordt uitgenodigd op het paleis voor een eerste verkennend gesprek, VTM NIEUWS, 29 May 2019.

The pair was named informers by the King, assigned with the task to identify the challenges for the state of Belgium together with the possibilities and necessary conditions to start the Federal government formation. Reynders and Vande Lanotte were to report by 6 June 2019 for the first time and announced media silence until that date., Belgian Royal Palace, 30 May 2019. For Reynders this meant the third assignment as informer; as this had already happened during the 2007\u201308 and 2010\u201311 Belgian government formations. For Johan Vande Lanotte it was the first time, although he had already been appointed mediator during the 2010\u201311 Belgian government formation. with Reynders and Vande Lanotte, King Philippe had chosen for two experienced politicians which were at the end of their national political career and both part of parties which had not won the most recent elections. The duo also consisted of a left (Vande Lanotte) and right (Reynders) politician which were both chosen from a language area where the opposing political side was dominant.Het Journaal, 30 May 2019 On 6 June 2019, King Philippe extended the mandate of Vande Lanotte and Reynders on their request until 17 June 2019. After their audience with the King, the informers held pressconference at the Egmont Palace where they announced they had met during the past week with representatives of all political parties with elected members in the Chamber of Representatives, with the exception of the radical parties Vlaams Belang and PVDA/PTB. Moreover, they had held meetings with representatives of the Workers' Unions, employers' organisations, the National Bank of Belgium, the network against poverty, as well as several Federal service organisations. They also saw climate expert Jean-Pascal van Ypersele. In the coming days they would also meet with the Federal Planning Bureau and poverty organisations.Koning verlengt opdracht van informateurs Reynders en Vande Lanotte, Gazet van Antwerpen, 6 June 2019.Reynders en Vande Lanotte vragen snelle regeringsvorming: \u201cScenario van 2010 en 2011 niet meer herhalen\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 6 June 2019.Koning verlengt opdracht van informateurs Reynders en Vande Lanotte: \u201cNiet met Vlaams Belang en PVDA gepraat\u201d, Het Nieuwsblad, 6 June 2019Reynders en Vande Lanotte blijven informateur tot 17 juni: \"Lange formatie van 2010 overdoen, is niet mogelijk\", VRT NWS, 6 June 2019.Reynders en Vande Lanotte hun taak als informateur wordt verlengd, VTM NIEUWS, 6 June 2019.

On Sunday 28 July 2019, a round table discussion took place between the informers and the presidents of the socialists, liberals, CD&V;, N-VA and Groen at the Egmont Palace in Brussels.

After his visit, PS-president Paul Magnette strongly criticized the Flemish nationalist N-VA, stating that the party put very strong community reform demands on the table while being unwilling to listen to the social demands of the socialist parties. He also stressed that other options were possible besides a purple-yellow government.TIJDLIJN. 232 dagen na de verkiezingen: koning verlengt opdracht informateurs Coens en Bouchez, Het Laatste Nieuws, 13 January 2020.

On 11 November Magnette provided feedback. He stated that all parties agreed on five central topics: climate, fighting poverty, increasing the employment rate, justice, and safety & migration. He also informed that he would create a content-driven document in which he would use statistics to give an objective view on the state of the country and in which he would formulate the goals of the next government, as the manner in how those goals would need to be achieved. He also intended to meet with European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, managing the Economic and Financial Affairs portfolio, and his successor Paolo Gentiloni concerning the poor condition of Belgium.Informateur Paul Magnette (PS) geeft stand van zaken en vond al zeker \u00e9\u00e9n overeenkomst: gaan voor meer jobs, VRT Nieuws, 11 November 2019.

The attempt of Paul Magnette to start formation discussions with the socialist, liberal and green parties failed. Within Open Vld there was a lot of internal division on such a coalition and on 7 December new MR- president Georges-Louis Bouchez stated that a government containing the six purple-green parties would have a too narrow majority to be able to operate in a stable manner.MR-voorzitter Georges-Louis Bouchez: \"Met paars-groen alleen gaan we het niet redden\", VRT Nieuws, 7 December 2019.

In the morning of 10 December also presidents Joachim Coens (CD&V;), Bart De Wever (N-VA) and Meyrem Almaci (Groen) came to an audience, followed in the afternoon by Jean- Marc Nollet and Rajae Maouane (Ecolo), Maxime Pr\u00e9vot (cdH), Fran\u00e7ois De Smet (D\u00e9FI) and Conner Rousseau (sp.a).Formatievraag van de dag: moet Bart De Wever al dan niet aan zet komen?, VRT Nieuws, 10 December 2019. ==== Informers Joachim Coens and Georges-Louis Bouchez (10 December 2019 \u2013 31 January 2020) ==== Joachim Coens, elected a few days prior to CD&V-president;, informer between 10 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. Georges-Louis Bouchez, elected a few days prior to MR-president, informer between 10 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. Following the consultation round with the party presidents, King Philippe appointed Joachim Coens (CD&V;) and Georges-Louis Bouchez (MR) as informers in the evening of 10 December 2019. Both had only been appointed a few days before to president of their respective parties and were tasked to investivate all possible further paths. They were asked to report back on 20 December 2019.Koning stelt Coens (CD&V;) en Bouchez (MR) aan als informateurs: \"Meeste partijen wilden De Wever (N-VA) niet aan zet\", VRT Nieuws, 10 December 2019.

In the following pressconference they stated to have had discussions with all parties, both individually as in groups of two or more parties. Their conclusion was that the two investigated possible coalitions, purple-yellow and purple-green, were not viable yet and hence they would also explore other possible coalitions. Based around five themes \u2013 the budgetary deficit, social policy, employment and the job market, climate, and safety, justice and migration \u2013 they intended to check which similarities existed between the ten parties to come to a majority in a pragmatic manner. They also announced to continue meeting with the ten parties and have a short consultation round with the Civil society to work out the details for each of the five themes.Koning verlengt informatieopdracht Coens en Bouchez: \"Ook andere formules dan paars- groen en paars-geel bekijken\", VRT Nieuws, 20 December 2019.

They also had discussions with the social partners, the National Bank of Belgium, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance and the foreigners' office. In the week of 6 January they invited the ten parties eligible for the federal government to explain their memo orally.Informateurs spreken met tien partijen in aanloop naar eindverslag, Het Laatste Nieuws, 6 January 2020. On 13 January 2020 the informers reported back to the King. As they had made insufficient progress, their assignment was prolonged until 28 January 2020, to further clarifiy the various points of view and to see whether it would be possible to bring the N-VA and the socialist parties PS and sp.a closer together in opinion. The day before N-VA president Bart De Wever had mentioned during his New Year's speech at the N-VA New Year's reception that his party was in favor of increasing the lowest pensions, which was considered as an opening towards the socialist parties.Informateurs Bouchez (MR) en Coens (CD&V;) brengen straks verslag uit bij koning, na overleg PS-N-VA gisteren, VRT Nieuws, 19 January 2020.

In the following week, N-VA, PS and sp.a had negotiations with each other, both with and without the two informers. They also set up working groups around specific issues to tackle, including climate, migration, pensions and health care.N-VA en PS hebben elke dag onderhandeld, Het Laatste Nieuws, 27 January 2020.

One day later, the informers reported back to the King again. After an audience of nearly four hours, the King unexpectedly decided o prolong the assignment with another week. Initially they received until 4 February to find a government coalition which has a majority overall, but was not required to have a majority in both language groups.Na opvallend lang gesprek: informateurs krijgen dan toch nog een week extra na hun verslag bij de koning, VRT Nieuws, 28 January 2020. Ont he evening of 31 January 2020 however, both informers were prematurely relieved of their duty. That day, Coens and Bouchez were again invited at the palace where they submitted their final report.Verrassing: Koen Geens (CD&V;) wordt koninklijk opdrachthouder, taak van informateurs Coens en Bouchez is be\u00ebindigd, VRT Nieuws, 31 January 2020. ==== Royal assignment holder Koen Geens (31 January 2020 \u2013 14 February 2020) ==== Koen Geens, tasked with a royal assignment on 31 January 2020. On 14 February he handed back his assignment, as negotiations between PS and N-VA had not lead to anything. On the same day as Coens and Bouchez were relieved of their task, the King tasked CD&V-Deputy; Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Koen Geens with a new Royal assignment. Geens was not given a formal title for his task and hance was referred to in the press as \"Royal assignment holder\". The appointment of Geens was a personal initiative by the King, as it had not been discussed beforehand with the party presidents. It hence came as a surprise, as the general expectations was that now N-VA-president Bart De Wever would be given an assignment.Koning benoemt Koen Geens (CD&V;) tot koninklijke opdrachthouder \u201com een volwaardige regering mogelijk te maken\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 31 January 2020. Geens was asked to try and form a government starting from the report of the informers. In his opiniong, his assignment was \"open\", meaning he was planning to meet with all eligible parties. The Royal assignment holder tried - partly under pressure from his own party \\- to especially move PS and N-VA into forming a coalition together. On 10 February Geens reported to the King, after which his assignment was extended with a week.Koning Filip verlengt opdracht van Koen Geens (CD&V;) met een week: \"Geniet vertrouwen van alle partijen\", VRT Nieuws, 10 February 2020. Geens wwas working on a starting document which contained several socialeconomic elements to start discussion with all concerned parties. Goal was to continue this process until the evening of 16 February, to return to the palace the day after with a more detailed memo. After Paul Magnette had declared on 14 February 2020, via various media sources, that a government including PS and N-VA was in his eyes impossible and that he was unwilling to continue negotiating with N-VA, Koen Geens realized continuing his assignment would be a waste of effort, causing him to return his assignment to the King that same day.Koning Filip aanvaardt ontslag Koen Geens en vat maandag consultaties aan, Knack, 14 February 2020. King Philippe accepted Geens' resignation. As the government formation was now completely stuck, the cry for new early federal elections became louder, with media stating that parties were already preparing themselves for an election campaign.Wetstraatjournalist Ivan De Vadder: \"Niemand wil nieuwe verkiezingen, maar alle partijen bereiden zich erop voor\", VRT NWS, 14 February 2020. ==== Royal assignment holders Sabine Laruelle and Patrick Dewael (19 February 2020 \u2013 16 March 2020) ==== Senate president Sabine Laruelle was tasked on 19 February 2020 together with Chamber of Representatives president Patrick Dewael as Royal assignment holder. On 16 March their assignment ended. From Monday 17 February, King Philippe started consulations with the presidents of the ten parties still in contention for government participation to discuss on how to progress. On 17 February Maxime Pr\u00e9vot (cdH), Meyrem Almaci (Groen) and Bart De Wever (N-VA) received and audience and on 18 February Conner Rousseau (sp.a), Georges-Louis Bouchez (MR) and the duo Jean-Marc Nollet and Rajae Maouane (Ecolo), followed finally by Paul Magnette (PS), Fran\u00e7ois De Smet (D\u00e9FI), Joachim Coens (CD&V;) and Gwendolyn Rutten (Open Vld) on 19 February.Koning ontvangt morgen nog PS, D\u00e9fi, CD&V; en Open Vld, Metrotime, 18 February 2020. After consulting with the party presidents, King Philippe decided to now put two liberals into action: Patrick Dewael (Open Vld) and Sabine Laruelle (MR), respectively presidents of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. With that, Laruelle became the first female in Belgian history to receive a Royal assignment.Koning verrast opnieuw: Sabine Laruelle (MR) en Patrick Dewael (Open Vld) aan zet, Het Laatste Nieuws, 19 February 2020. Similarly as for Geens, no official title was bestowed upon them and hence they were referred to as Royal assignment holders. They were expected back on 9 March 2020. One day after receiving their assignment, Dewael and Laruelle sent out a press release in which they announced to be going to work in complete discretion, not communicating on their assignment, proceedings and possible progress, to let rest return in the formation process.Persmededeling van de koninklijke opdrachthouders dhr. Dewael en mevr. Laruelle, website Chamber of Representatives. According to unnamed sources from within the government, Dewael and Laruelle tried initially to form an emergency government, which would tackle the most urgent issues, more specifically the budget deficit, which was under threat of increasing further due to the economic impacts following the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium. This emergency government would consist of the parties of the outgoing Wilm\u00e8s I Government (MR, CD&V;, Open Vld), completed with the socialist and green parties, corresponding to the so- called Vivaldi-coalition. During the weekend of 7 and 8 March the assignment holders were planning to bring all parties around the table to discuss a so- called framework note, describing topics as budget, socio-economic reforms, ethical topics and an agenda for a state reform.Koninklijke opdrachthouders Dewael en Laruelle willen praten over brede inhoudelijke nota, VRT Nieuws, 6 March 2020. This was cancelled however, as not all parties needed for the Vivaldi-coalition were ready to step into such a coalition. On 7 March, CD&V; sent out an online inquiry to its members, asking to give their opinion on the course that CD&V; had been taken during the negotiations thus far, namely to stress the need for a majority on the Flemish side, which would only be possible by having N-VA part of the government.CD&V; bevraagt leden over regeringsvorming: \"Vasthouden aan Vlaamse meerderheid of toch niet?\", VRT Nieuws, 8 March 2020. On 9 March the results were announced: 63 percent of their members announced were in favor of a government having a Flemish majority. As a result, CD&V; remained pushing for a government including N-VA.CD&V; houdt het been stijf: \"N-VA moet kans krijgen volwaardig te participeren\", VRT Nieuws, 9 March 2020. That same day, assignment holders Laruelle and Dewael reported back to King Philippe. Their mission was extended until 16 March, to take the necessary initiatives to form a new government as quickly as possible, to tackle the urgent problems with highest priority.Koning verlengt opdracht twee opdrachthouders tot 16 maart, \"om snel regering te vormen\", VRT Nieuws, 9 March 2020. On 12 March cdH-president Maxime Pr\u00e9vot and D\u00e9FI-president Fran\u00e7ois De Smet sent out a press release in which they stated to be willing to help out a purple-green government in case CD&V; would remain fixed on having a Flemish mjaority. One of both parties would in that case join the government instead of CD&V;, with the other voting to abstain during the vote of confidence in parliament.Geen CD&V; in de regering? CDH en D\u00e9fi doen aanbod aan Dewael en Laruelle, Knack, 12 March 2020. In the meantime, stricter measures were being taken to curtail the Coronavirus and protect public health. The epidemic threatened to be causing an economic disaster: companies were struggling and stock markets plummeted. As there was still no full government formed to replace the caretaker Wilm\u00e8s I Government, it became very difficult to take concrete actions to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus.Moet er snel een echte regering komen om de coronacrisis te bezweren?, VRT Nieuws, 12 March 2020. As a result, the urgency for creating at least an emergency government increased. On 13 March the information leaked that N-VA and PS had met the prior evening to discuss forming an emergency government. The coming together of both parties was explained by the fact that Jan Jambon (N-VA) and Elio Di Rupo (PS), respectively Minister-President of Flanders and Minister-President of Wallonia, were sitting together frequently to discuss possible measures to fight the Coronavirus. One day later, party presidents Bart De Wever (N-VA) and Conner Rousseau (sp.a) jointly declared the need of quickly forming an emergency government. De Wever suggested to have this government exist only for a limited period of time with its main and most important goal to fight the negative consequences of the Coronavirus.De Wever roept op tot noodregering: \u201cEr moet onmiddellijk iets gebeuren op federaal niveau\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 14 March 2020.

On the evening of 14 March, N-VA, PS, sp.a, MR, Open Vld and CD&V;, lead by Royal assignment holders Laruelle and Dewael, came together to discuss concretely the planning in forming an emergency government. On 15 March, at 2:00 a.m., the negotiators split without coming to an agreement, but with the intention to continue later that day.Topoverleg noodregering gaat vandaag verder, Het Laatste Nieuws, 15 March 2020. Later that morning however, it became apparent that PS and MR were not in favor of an emergency government, stating that replacing the Ministers and changing the composition of the various cabinets at this point in time would take too much time, better spent to fight the Coronavirus directly.PS en MR trekken stekker uit noodregering: \u201cTijdverlies, onze enige prioriteit is coronacrisis\u201d, Het Nieuwsblad, 15 March 2020. On 15 March, in the afternoon, again negotiations were held between MR, CD&V;, Open Vld, N-VA, PS and sp.a. Later that day Groen, Ecolo, cdH and D\u00e9FI also joined the group. In the evening, the assignment holders were able to announce that the ten parties had come to an agreement. The Wilm\u00e8s I Government would ask the Chamber of Representatives for a vote of confidence, which would turn this government into a new temporary minority Wilm\u00e8s II Government, with support from the opposition. The Wilm\u00e8s II Government would govern only for a predefined limited amount of time and be in force only to fight the Coronacrisis. To be able to do this, the government received powers of attorney by the parliament, supported by all ten parties.Minderheidsregering-Wilm\u00e8s krijgt voor enkele maanden steun (en volmachten) van oppositie om coronacrisis aan te pakken, VRT Nieuws, 15 March 2020.Regering-Wilm\u00e8s maakt doorstart als minderheidsregering en krijgt van oppositiepartijen tijdelijke volmachten om coronacrisis aan te pakken, Het Laatste Nieuws, 15 March 2020. ==== Formateur Sophie Wilm\u00e8s (16 March 2020 \u2013 17 March 2020) ==== Outgoing Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s was named formateur on 16 March 2020 to replace the current caretaker government with a temporary minority government to combat the negative effects of the Coronacrisis. On Monday 16 March 2020 King Philippe appointed Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s (MR) to Royal Formateur. Following the political agreement of 15 March, she received the assignment to form a government composed of Open Vld, CD&V; and MR. That same day she invited the ten parties to make concrete agreements concerning the powers of attorney.Sophie Wilm\u00e8s moet nu nieuwe regering vormen en wil het met minder ministers doen, Het Nieuwsblad, 16 March 2020. Later that evening it became apparent that N-VA would not be giving the Wilm\u00e8s II Government a vote of confidence in the parliament, but would agree to give powers of attorney to such a government. On Tuesday 17 March Sophie Wilm\u00e8s again took the oath as Prime Minister, asking the confidence to the Chamber of Representatives, to form a government with the same Ministers as the Wilm\u00e8s I Government.Wilm\u00e8s kan aan de slag, Het Nieuwsblad, 17 March 2020. In her opening government statement, she asked the parliament to grant powers of attorney for six months, solely to combat the Coronacrisis. The debate in parliament was held on 19 March 2020 with the vote of confidence happening that same day.Premier Sophie Wilm\u00e8s (MR) vraagt morgen het vertrouwen in de Kamer, VRT Nieuws, 16 March 2020. As the Wilm\u00e8s II Government asked for a vote of confidence solely to take Coronameasures and for a period of six months only, concerning all other political issues the government would not have powers to make any other decisions. The parties in the government and those parties giving powers of attorney would be involved in a so-called superkern (supercore) in which all decisions to be taken were discussed beforehand. This supercore consisted of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers and the presidents of the ten political parties supporting the powers of attorney and would meet starting from 21 March 2020 Superkern eerste keer samen: onwennige show die weinig kan opleveren, Newsmonkey, 21 March 2020. on every Saturday, with exception of the last supercore meeting on 12 June 2020,Superkern bereikt akkoord over nieuw pakket relancemaatregelen: belastingsverminderingen en \u2018corona-werkloosheid\u2019, Het Nieuwsblad, 12 June 2020. which occureded on a Friday. N-VA instead decided to nominate Chamber of Representatives fraction leader Peter De Roover. In the meantime, the search for a government with full legislative powers and a full-fledged coalition agreement continued. On 26 March the Chamber of Representatives agreed to grant powers of attorney to the Wilm\u00e8s II Government, one day later the Senate did the same.De Senaat heeft beslist het ontwerp van volmachtenwet niet te amenderen, Senate, 27 March 2020.

In April 2020 more and more parties started to doubt the use of the powers of attorney, which resulted in the fact that there was no longer a majority for extending the term in June by a further three months.Wilm\u00e8s kan nieuwe volmachten vergeten, De Standaard, 27 April 2020. Nevertheless, the Wilm\u00e8s II Government would remain with full powers until September to keep combatting the consequences of the Coronacrisis. On 12 June, just before the start of the last supercore meeting, MR-president Georges-Louis Bouchez announced the government would not be asking for a prolonging of the powers of attorney, which meant these were ending on 26 June.Federale regering zal geen verlenging volmachten vragen, Het Laatste Nieuws, 12 June 2020. To avoid having the Wilm\u00e8s II Government drop back into the caretaker status, the socialist party presidents Paul Magnette (PS) and Conner Rousseau (sp.a), as the largest political family in the Chamber of Representatives, took the initiative to have exploratory talks, with the goal of forming a full-fledged new government with a parliamentary majority by September. From 13 May they met with all other party president colleagues, with the exception of those of PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang., newsmonkey, 17 May 2020. This initiative is not linked to decision by the Royal Palace, as legally the Wilm\u00e8s II Government was still operating under full power and hence King Philippe was not allowed to take any initiative to form a new government. Other presidents, such as the newly appointed Open Vld- president Egbert Lachaert, who was elected on 22 May to succeed Gwendolyn Rutten as Open Vld-president,Egbert Lachaert met 61 procent overtuigend verkozen tot nieuwe voorzitter Open Vld, Tommelein strandt op 30 procent, Het Laatste Nieuws, 22 May 2020. had proposed to have the parties in the minority government (MR, CD&V; and Open Vld), possibly togerther with sp.a, create a central memo to which other parties could join to negotiate a coalition agreement. On 24 May sp.a-president Conner Rousseau announced that the first round of the exploratory talks was complete.Sp.a-voorzitter Conner Rousseau ziet vooruitgang in \u2018snuffelronde\u2019 regeringsvorming: \u201cEr zijn openingen\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 24 May 2020. Rousseau and Magnette wrote a report based on their findings following the discussions, after which the organised a second round of talks to present these findings to the other party presidents. On 6 June it became known that the second round of talks was finished. Magnette and Rousseau composed a report of their activities, with the goal of now naming a formateur, who would be tasked with forming a government by September.\"Snuffelronde\" Rousseau en Magnette voorbij: \"Er zou formateur kunnen worden benoemd voor regering voor einde zomer\", VRT Nieuws, 6 June 2020. On Monday 15 June, the initiative takers handed their report to Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, after they had given an oral explanation to the ten parties with which they had met. The socialist party presidents concluded that Wilm\u00e8s was the most appropriate person to continue further discussions on forming a new government. As there were still too many stumbling stones to form a purple-yellow or Vivaldi coalition, Rousseau and Magnette proposed a classical tri-party coalition of socialists (PS and sp.a), liberals (MR and Open Vld) and Christian democrats (CD&V; and cdH). This coalition would however not have a majority, as the three political families together only held 71 of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives. In this case, extra political partners would need to be found for each specific topic. Premier Wilm\u00e8s however was not willing to take the formation discussion into her own hands, as the current progress had been insufficient and Magnette and Rousseau were not able to give sufficient guarantees that her assignment would be successful. She demanded the socialist presidents to further work out their report, but they stated that their report was final and they did not wish to continue their initiative.\"Snuffelronde\" van SP.A en PS afgelopen: ze willen premier Wilm\u00e8s nu aan zet in regeringsvorming, maar zij wijst af, VRT Nieuws, 15 June 2020. Various other parties, such as CD&V;, Open Vld, Groen, Ecolo and N-VA, were not enthusiastic about the proposition of the socialists and rather favored a stable government with full parliamentary majority.Socialisten willen regering met liberalen en christendemocraten, al heeft die geen meerderheid: \"Anders verkiezingen\", VRT Nieuws, 16 June 2020. ==== Initiative by Georges-Louis Bouchez, Egbert Lachaert and Joachim Coens (17 June 2020 \u2013 19 July 2020) ==== Flag of the state of Arizona. This refers to the Arizonacoalition, a government that initiative takers Georges-Louis Bouchez, Egbert Lachaert, and Joachim Coens tried to form. The bottom half of the flag, coloring blue, refers to the liberal parties MR and Open Vld, the red and yellow rays in the upper half symbolize respectively sp.a and N-VA, and the orange star represents Christian democrat parties CD&V; and cdH. On 17 June Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s met with Georges-Louis Bouchez (MR), Egbert Lachaert (Open Vld), and Joachim Coens (CD&V;), presidents of the three government parties, to discuss the proposition by Conner Rousseau and Paul Magnette. Afterward it became known that these three now took the lead of the formation discussions, starting from the government parties, as Egbert Lachaert had proposed earlier. The three presidents, commonly named 'Three Kings' by the press, declared that a classical triparty was not their preference and they intended foremost to form a stable majority government, which had to set up strong support- and repair policies to combat the consequences of the Coronacrisis. According to MR-president Bouchez a triparty government could only be considered if all other options had been eliminated. The three initiative takers hoped to have a better view on a possible majority coalition by the Belgian National Day of 21 July.Drie partijvoorzitters op zoek naar \"een meerderheid\": wat zijn de slaagkansen van deze laatste formatiepoging?, VRT Nieuws, 17 June 2020. In the meantime, the government would, in consultation with the communities, prepare a recovery plan to combat the economic consequences of the Coronacrisis.Persmededeling over regeringsvorming namens MR, Open Vld en CD&V;, Open Vld, 17 June 2020. According to several sources, the three initiative takers were working in the first place on a coalition without the PS, in which sp.a and cdH would join the Swedish coalition from the previous legislature (N-VA, CD&V;, Open Vld and MR). This coalition, named Arizonacoalition in the media (referring to the flag of the U.S. state of Arizona), would have a narrow majority of 76 of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, but would be a minority in the parliamentary commissions, which would be preparing the legislative tasks. Moreover, sp.a would need to drop its political family member PS, and MR and cdH would only represent 19 of 61 Francophone seats, all making this coalition difficult.Dan maar zonder PS? Drie regeringspartijen hebben scenario zonder Franstalige socialisten, Het Nieuwsblad, 22 June 2020. On 29 June the initiative takers announced they were working on a substantive note around a recovery plan which would ease the socioeconomic consequences of the Coronacrisis and which would focus on social security, health care, and durability. This note was initially aimed to convince the six parties which would be part of the Arizonacoalition to start negotiating about a new government, as these were also the remaining parties that had not called out a veto against each other. Nevertheless, it was not excluded that other parties could still possibly join the negotiations at a later point.Lachaert (Open VLD), Coens (CD&V;) en Bouchez (MR) willen deze week inhoudelijke nota klaar hebben, VRT Nieuws, 29 June 2020. Two days later, on 1 July, sp.a-president Rousseau declared willing to talk about an Arizonacoalition, on condition that the trio of initiative takers would take into account some important demands from his party in their starting note. To make clear what these demands were exactly, Rousseau handed a note to the trio, in which he demanded (amongst other) strong investments in health care and a fair contribution by wealthy individuals and large multinationals. Before that, N-VA and cdH had as well sent their priorities to the initiative takers.Conner Rousseau (SP.A) stuurt nota naar voorzitters regeringspartijen, Het Nieuwsblad, 1 July 2020. On Thursday 2 July 2020 the Chamber of Representatives had on the agenda a proposal to further decrease the penalization on abortion, a topic which was very sensitive with government party CD&V.; They, as well as cdH, N-VA, and Vlaams Belang were opposed to the proposition. Allegedly, CD&V;, MR, and Open Vld had an agreement to send the case back to the qualified commission, despite support for the case by the liberal parties. In the afternoon of 2 July, MR-president Bouchez announced however that he would allow the parliament members of his party to vote freely according to their beliefs. His CDxV colleague Joachim Coens was very displeased about this, stating a breach of trust. Eventually, the case was defined by demanding advice from the Council of State, avoiding a vote. Nevertheless, CD&V; held an internal meeting and decided to pause the government formation. According to Coens the confidence between MR and CD&V; needed to be regained before the formation could be continued.CD&V-voorzitter; Coens zet formatie op pauze door abortuskwestie: \u201cEerst vertrouwen herstellen\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 3 July 2020. One day later the initiative takers held a crisisdeliberation and the fight between Coens and Bouchez was resolved, after which the trio continued their formation discussions.Plooien gladgestreken tussen CD&V; en MR over abortuswet: federale regeringsonderhandelingen kunnen hervatten, VRT Nieuws, 3 July 2020.

Sp.a and cdH refused however to accept the invitation; as they felt more bilateral conversations were necessary, as they had not yet received sufficient guarantees. As a result, the meeting was cancelledFormatie: vergadering met zes Arizona-partijen geannuleerd, Knack, 6 July 2020. and bilateral meetings were held the following days; the same day the negotiators met with N-VA-president Bart De Wever, followed by a meeting on 7 July with cdH-president Maxime Pr\u00e9votDrie koningen\" geven formatiehoop nog niet op: gisteravond praatten ze met N-VA- voorzitter Bart De Wever, VRT Nieuws, 7 July 2020. and on 9 July with sp.a-president Conner Rousseau.Gesprek tussen SP.A-voorzitter Rousseau en drie regeringsvormers afgelopen: \"Het is niet gelukt, het is niet mislukt\", VRT Nieuws, 9 July 2020.

The three negotiators reacted cautiously optimistic to Magnette's statement, but declared they would not restart the negotiations from scratch. They intended to confer with the six parties in the Arizona-coalition to discuss their starting note, and if it led to something, possibly involve the PS as well in the government formation discussions.Lachaert (Open VLD) positief over opening PS, \"Maar nu niet weer van nul starten, basisnota heeft sociale accenten\", VRT Nieuws, 15 July 2020. On 16 July a meeting took place with the technicians or so-called sherpa's of MR, Open Vld, CD&V;, cdH, N-VA, and sp.a. This did not lead to much; both N-VA as sp.a had several remarks and were of the opinion the note of the three negotiators did not meet their needs sufficiently. Bouchez, Coens and Lachaert then asked those parties to write a text in which they proposed what should be changed in their starting note. On 17 July another meeting between the sherpa's would take place, but was cancelled at last instance as N-VA and sp.a had not proposed any concrete changes. In the meantime news leaked that those parties had also been having discrete discussions with the PS about the possible formation of a purple-yellow government.Toenadering N-VA en PS doorkruist voorlopig Arizona-coalitie, Knack, 18 July 2020. As a result of this, the three initiative takers decided on 19 July to stop their attempts, according to them it was of nu further use to talk about an Arizonacoalition until there was more clarity about the viability of a purple-yellow government.\u2018Drie koningen\u2019 zetten opdracht stil: het is eerst aan PS en N-VA, De Morgen, 19 July 2020. ==== Preformationists Bart De Wever and Paul Magnette (20 July 2020 \u2013 18 August 2020) ==== Following the probing conversations between N-VA and PS, and after a consultation by telephone of the Palace with all parties that had been involved in the discussions after the elections, party presidents Bart De Wever (N-VA) and Paul Magnette (PS) received an audience on 20 July 2020 by King Philippe. Both parties had indicated they were willing to sit together and hence De Wever and Magnette received the assignment by the Palace to take the necessary initiatives to form a majority government. As they had to prepare the formation of a government, thet were called \"preformationists\" by the media (while officially, with still a government in place, the Palace is not entitled to hand out this title). On 31 July Magnette and De Wever were expected to report back to the King.Koning laat De Wever en Magnette regering vormen aan vooravond van nationale feestdag, Knack, 20 July 2020. De Wever and Magnette tried to find consensus amongst the parties with which they were negotiating on three specific topics: institutional reforms, the socio-economic policy, and safety and migration.Komt er schot in de formatie? Paul Magnette (PS) en Bart De Wever (N-VA) straks naar de koning, VRT Nieuws, 31 July 2020. On 28 July De Wever and Magnette invited the presidents of the liberal (MR and Open Vld) and Christian democrat (CD&V; and cdH) parties to orally elaborate on their note and confer with these parties on their opinions.De Wever en Magnette praten met liberalen, CD&V; en cdH, De Morgen, 28 July 2020.

One day late, Magnette and De Wever again went to King Philippe, who extended their assignment until 8 August, with the request to bring the party presidents together as soon as possible to find a supporting plane for the creation of a majority government.Audi\u00ebntie Bart De Wever en Paul Magnette, monarchie.be, 31 July 2020. That same day it became clear that Magnette and De Wever intended to form a government with the N-VA and the socialist and Christian democrat parties, as well as one liberal party. For the liberal party, they were specifically looking towards Open Vld, as the attitude op MR-president Georges-Louis Bouchez aroused resentment, as according to several parties Bouchez' only intention was to make the negotiations fail such as to keep the Wilm\u00e8s II Government (containing seven MR ministers) in place. The next day Open Vld held an extensive party meeting, at which was unanimously decided that the socio-economic and institutional content of the starting note of the preformationists had to be adjusted before negotiations could start as well as the fact that the party wanted to remain together with its liberal Francophone colleagues from MR.Open VLD: \"Inhoud die N-VA en PS naar voren schuiven, moet worden bijgestuurd\", VRT Nieuws, 1 August 2020. On 4 August the preformationists set up a meeting with the green parties Ecolo and Groen, to discuss their starting note.Groen gaat in op uitnodiging van De Wever en Magnette voor ontmoeting, Het Laatste Nieuws, 3 August 2020. The green parties as well were of the opinion that serious changes needed to happen for the starting note to be acceptable for them.

Thereafter on 6 August a meeting was held between the performationists and sp.a, CD&V; and cdH, in which they analysed which options remained to them after the discussions with the liberals and the greens.N-VA, PS, SP.A, CD&V; en CDH zitten rond de tafel, Het Nieuwsblad, 6 August 2020. The day after a new meeting with the liberal parties was held, who now stated they were willing to talk about the staring note with the preformationists, on the condition that De Wever and Magnette gave more insights on the specific formula they had in mind. On 8 August the preformationists returned to the King, who again extended their assignment, now until 17 August. King Philippe specifically requested all involved parties to display a sense of responsibility to quickly obtain a coalition agreement.Koning verlengt opdracht De Wever en Magnette tot 17 augustus, Het Laatste Nieuws, 17 August 2020.

The day after, on 14 August, a short meeting took place with the liberal parties, but no progress was made, after which De Wever and Magentte decided to hand in their resignation as preformationists at their audience on 17 August and ask the King to hand over the lead of the formation discussions to the liberal and green parties.Over en uit voor duo Magnette-De Wever: preformateurs gooien de handdoek in de ring, Het Laatste Nieuws, 14 August 2020.

The possible Vivaldicoalition was named after him, with his work the four seasons referring to the four political tendencies present in the coalition. After his consultations, King Philippe handed Open Vld-president Egbert Lachaert the assignment of forming a government, simultaneously accepting the resignation of De Wever and Magnette.Na rijp beraad: koning aanvaardt ontslag van De Wever en Magnette en stuurt Lachaert het veld in, VRT Nieuws, 18 August 2020. Just as his predecessors, Lachaert was asked to look for a broad majority coalition in parliament and announced he would be carrying out his task with discretion. On 28 August he was expected back at the Palace to report on progress. On Wednesday 26 August, in a conversation with N-VA-president Bart De Wever, Lachaert made clear that he intended at first to investigate a Vivaldicoalition of liberals (MR and Open Vld), socialists (PS and sp.a), greens (Ecolo and Groen) and CD&V.; Two days prior to that, the Flemish Christian democrats, who had for a long time been insisting for a government with a majority on the Flemish side \u2014 only possible when N-VA is part of it \u2014 had decided at a party meeting that they were open to discuss such a coalition, on condition some demands of their party were taken into account. These included a thorough state reform shifting authorizations towards the communities and no implementation of any ethical agenda. On 26 and 27 August the assignment holder presented a substantial note to the socialist, green and Christian democrat parties.Egbert Lachaert (Open VLD) gaat officieel voor regering zonder N-VA: \u201cEr wordt met partijen van goede wil gesproken\u201d, Het Nieuwsblad, 27 August 2020. The day after, King Philippe extended the assignment of Lachaert to 4 September, as the socialists \u2014 whose demands regarding pensions, health care and taxation were difficult for the liberals \u2014 and CD&V; were not sufficiently convinced to move to a next phase.Koning verlengt opdracht van Egbert Lachaert tot 4 september: \"Binnen de week hopen op nieuws en volgende stap\", VRT Nieuws, 28 August 2020. On Sunday 30 August, Lachaert met with cdH-president Maxime Pr\u00e9vot to discuss his starting note, after which he brought together than evening Open Vld, MR, PS, sp.a, Ecolo, Groen, and CD&V; for an informative meeting.Vivaldi-partijen voor het eerst samen aan tafel: bij CD&V; \u201cheel wat bezorgdheden over inhoud\u201d, Het Laatste Nieuws, 31 August 2020. On the evening of 31 August the top CD&V; party members got together again to discuss the possible participation in a Vivaldi coalition. Still, the party was not fully convinced and requested further clarifications from the Royal assignment holder.CD&V-top; zat samen over federale formatie maar heeft veel vragen, Coens vraagt verduidelijkingen van Lachaert, VRT Nieuws, 31 August 2020. After CD&V-president; Joachim Coens had indicated he was willing to give the negotiations for a Vivaldicoalition a chance, a meeting was held in the afternoon of 3 September between eight partiesa: PS, sp.a, Open Vld, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V;, and cdH. No breakthrough was made as there were still some discussion points for which no agreement was found, including social security, abortion, taxation and phasing out of the nuclear power plants.Komt federale formatie in laatste rechte lijn? 8 partijen zaten samen, maar er zijn nog enkele hindernissen, VRT Nieuws, 3 September 2020. The morning of 4 September, the eight parties met again to discuss these remaining points and to possibly assign one or more formationists who would lead the negotiations further.Open VLD-voorzitter Lachaert brengt straks opnieuw verslag uit bij de koning: kan de formatie nu echt beginnen?, VRT Nieuws, 3 September 2020. ==== Preformationists Egbert Lachaert and Conner Rousseau (4 September 2020 \u2013 23 September 2020) ==== After the eight parties had found a solution for the remaining discussion points in the morning of 4 September, Lachaert returned his task as Royal assignment holder back to the King. Lachaert declared he would like to continue negotiating with the parties currently involved, with the exception of cdH, which was no longer invited from that point on. As there was no unanimity on who should lead the government, no formationist was appointed yet and instead Lachaert and Rousseau were named preformationists together. In a following press conference, Lachaert declared what would be the most important priorities for the new government: reforming the political system (both institutional reforms as the manner in which politics is being done), reinforcing social security and health care, making the economy and labor market more efficient, an ambitions climate policy, a simple transparent and just taxation, a strong safety policy, an efficient justice system and a credible budget plan. Ultimately by 11 September the preformationists are to report back to the Palace.Lachaert (Open VLD) en Rousseau (SP.A) worden preformateur: \"Na de stilstand moeten we eindelijk vooruit\", VRT Nieuws, 4 September 2020. On Tuesday 8 September preformationist Lachaert tested positive for the Coronavirus, resulting in all party presidents and technical negotiators involved in the negotiations being placed in quarantine for up to nine days. This meant that until 16 SeptemberPartijvoorzitters die onderhandelen over nieuwe regering hebben negatief getest op het coronavirus, VRT Nieuws, 16 September 2020. only digital formation discussions were possible. This made it very unlikely for the negotiators to be able to meet the deadline of 17 September, the date at which Sophie Wilm\u00e8s would again have to ask for a vote of confidence for her government, as she had promised during her government statement in the Chamber of Representatives on 17 March.Zes voorzitters Vivaldi-partijen en koning testen negatief, tot 18 september geen fysieke formatievergaderingen, VRT Nieuws, 9 September 2020. Moreover, several negotiating parties stated they would rather decide in a physical meeting who would become formationist. On 10 September the presidents of the negotiating parties agreed that Sophie Wilm\u00e8s would be allowed to only need to ask for confidence on 1 October,Regering van Sophie Wilm\u00e8s gaat door tot 1 oktober, Het Nieuwsblad, 10 September 2020. and the following day the assignment of the preformationists was extended via a telephone audience until 21 September.Opdracht van preformateurs wordt verlengd tot 21 september, Het Nieuwsblad, 11 September 2020. Upon resuming of the physical negotiations, working groups were created which were focusing on specific topics, such as climate, fiscal reforms, migration, and the preparation of a new state reform by the elections of 2024. On 20 September the negotiations between the seven parties were abruptly stopped, due to displeasure concerning the attitude of MR-president Georges-Louis Bouchez, who kept challenging agreements which had been made earlier in the working groups, demanded that his party member Sophie Wilm\u00e8s would remain Prime Minister and had lashed out heavily at PS-president Paul Magnette in an interview. To recover confidence, the preformationists held separate conversations with each of the parties involved, including Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s in the discussions. All parties separated ways without an agreement, however.Ergernis over MR-voorzitter Bouchez verstoort formatie, poging tot lijmen van preformateurs levert nog niets op, VRT Nieuws, 20 September 2020. The next morning, sp.a decided it no longer wanted to negotiate with MR, as according to them this party was not willing to come to a solution. Open Vld however was still not willing to be separated from MR and wanted to continue under the current constellation, or else Lachaert would return his assignment to the King. Nevertheless, sp.a again joined the meeting that afternoon together with MR, Open Vld, PS, Ecolo, Groen, and CD&V;, in an attempt to clear up the problems between the parties. No progress was made, after which the preformationists returned to the King to inform him no consensus had been found on how to continue, and to hand in their resignation. Kign Philippe however refused to accept their resignation and instead demanded them to continue, giving them until 23 September to restore confidence between the seven parties.LIVE.

King Philippe appointed two coformationists: Alexander De Croo (Open Vld) and Paul Magnette (PS), implicitly making the duo the two prime candidates to become the next Prime Minister. They were given until 28 September to write a first report, to allow a new government to be created by the due date of 1 October.
