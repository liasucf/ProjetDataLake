    "text": "Pyra Labs was the company that created the Blogger service in 1999. It was acquired by Google in 2003. ==History== Pyra was co-founded by Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan. The company's first product, also named \"Pyra\", was a web application which would combine a project manager, contact manager, and to-do list. In 1999, while still in beta, the rudiments of Pyra were repurposed into an in-house tool which became Blogger. The service was made available to the public in August 1999. Much of this coding was done by Paul Bausch and Matthew Haughey. Initially, Blogger was completely free of charge and there was no revenue model. In January 2001, Pyra asked Blogger users for donations to buy a new server. When the company's seed money dried up around the same time, the employees continued without pay for weeks or, in some cases, months; but this could not last, and eventually Williams faced a mass walk-out by everyone including co-founder Hourihan. Williams ran the company virtually alone until he was able to secure an investment by Trellix after its founder Dan Bricklin became aware of Pyra's situation. Eventually advertising-supported Blogspot and Blogger Pro emerged. In 2002, Blogger was completely re-written in order to license it to other companies, the first of which was Globo.com of Brazil. In 2003, Pyra was acquired by Google. ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Blogger's History Reimagined * How the Blogger Deal Happened Category:Defunct software companies of the United States Category:Google acquisitions Category:American companies established in 1999 Category:Software companies established in 1999 Category:Software companies disestablished in 2003 Category:2003 mergers and acquisitions Category:1999 establishments in California ",
