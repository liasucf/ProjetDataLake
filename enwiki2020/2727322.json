While an active player, Johnson stood tall, weighing . He batted and threw right-handed. Johnson later served as an MLB hitting coach for 12 seasons with the California Angels (\u2013; \u2013), New York Mets (), Phillies (\u2013), Seattle Mariners (\u2013), and White Sox (). He was still an active member of the California coaching staff when diagnosed with lung cancer, which claimed his life on April 23, 1992, at the age of 53. == Playing career == Deron Johnson first appeared in a major league game on September 20, 1960. The 22-year-old was called upon to pinch hit in the ninth inning of a 1-1 tie between New York and Washington, facing Senators southpaw Hal Woodeshick. Mickey Mantle flied out to right and Bill Skowron doubled. Johnson advanced Skowron to third with a flyout to center. The Yankees won 2-1 in the 11th. He got his first two career hits on October 2, 1960 in the Yankees' last game of the regular season, an 8-7 win over the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Johnson batted twice in the game\u2014the first resulted in a fifth-inning double off Red Sox pitcher Jerry Casale, and in the seventh he singled off Arnold Earley. Johnson's contract was purchased from Kansas City by the Cincinnati Reds on April 5, 1963. Playing for Triple-A San Diego, he topped the Pacific Coast League with 33 home runs, tied for fifth with 91 RBI, and was picked as first baseman on the PCL All-Star team. 1964 was his first full season in the major leagues with the Reds where he posted a .273 average with 21 home runs and 79 runs batted in. The 1965 season with the Cincinnati Reds was one of the best of Johnson's career, as he hit .287, hit 32 home runs, and drove in an MLB-leading 130 runs. Rose was quoted in 1983, \"I had never seen anyone hit the ball harder than Deron Johnson.\" While playing for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1971 Johnson clubbed 34 homers and drove in over 90 runs. Further proof of Johnson\u2019s long-ball skill was evident on July 10 and 11, 1971, as he belted four consecutive home runs against the Montreal Expos, three of them coming on the 11th.http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/438a5a83 Johnson hit .300 in the 1973 World Series while playing with the Oakland A's.

On September 7, Johnson was sold to the Boston Red Sox, who were in the middle of a pennant fight they ultimately lost. The following April he signed with the White Sox. In 148 games for the White Sox, Johnson hit 18 home runs, and drove in 72 RBI. On September 21, after Jim Rice had been injured earlier in the day, the Red Sox once again needed supplemental power and reacquired Johnson. Johnson's last home run of his career came on September 27, 1975 off of Indians pitcher Rick Waits at Fenway Park. In 1765 games over 16 seasons, Johnson posted a .244 batting average (1447-for-5941) with 706 runs, 247 doubles, 33 triples, 245 home runs, 923 RBI, 585 bases on balls, .311 on-base percentage and .420 slugging percentage.
