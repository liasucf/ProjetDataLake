    "text": "Alfred Cove is a southern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Melville. ==History== It is named after the adjacent sheltered cove in the Swan River, which is in turn named after Alfred Waylen (1833-1901), a pioneer settler in the area who was granted Swan Location 74, covering most of present-day Alfred Cove and Myaree. It contains Tompkins Park, and has a population of 2,048. == Wildlife == The suburb is home to a variety of migrant and native species of birds and animals as the hinterland offers a comfortable habitat including the mudflats, seagrass beds and intertidal vegetation. Some of the migratory wading birds come from as far as Siberia, Mongolia and Asia and many of these species are protected under international agreements. ==See also== * Electoral district of Alfred Cove ==References== Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Swan River (Western Australia) Category:Suburbs in the City of Melville ",
