Quantico is an American television series created by Joshua Safran and produced by ABC Studios. Priyanka Chopra stars as Alex Parrish, a bright FBI recruit, who after graduating from the FBI Academy, joins the agency and later becomes a prime suspect of a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. The main cast include Priyanka Chopra, Jake McLaughlin, Yasmine Al Massri, Johanna Braddy, Tate Ellington, Graham Rogers, Anabelle Acosta as her fellow recruits, and Josh Hopkins and Aunjanue Ellis as their trainers at the FBI academy, Quantico, Virginia. In the second season, Russell Tovey, Pearl Thusi, and Blair Underwood were added to the main cast following the CIA plot elements. In the third season, Marlee Matlin and Alan Powell were added to the main cast. ==Main characters== ===Alex Parrish=== Priyanka Chopra Alexandra \"Alex\" Parrish (portrayed by Priyanka Chopra), a former top recruit at Quantico as well as a promising FBI agent was considered a prime suspect in the Grand Central Terminal bombing. She was later pardoned after the real mastermind terrorist behind the Grand Central bombing and the Command Center bombing in New York was revealed. After the negative publicity to the FBI stemming from Liam O'Connor's treachery as well as Simon Asher's death at Quantico, Alex is fired by the organization. Two months after the presidential election ended, Alex is approached by CIA director Matthew Keyes, who provides an opportunity for her to join and work for the organization. After working as a CIA analyst for six months, she is given an undercover assignment by the FBI. She is tasked to pose as a CIA recruit at The Farm in order to expose the rogue faction within the agency called the AIC. Months after leaving The Farm, a hostage crisis at the G-20 summit in New York is declared by a terrorist group called the Citizens Liberation Front. Two weeks after the end of the crisis, former President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force, between the CIA and FBI. Alex was reinstated to work as an FBI agent. Shortly after the task force is formed, Clay Haas was assigned as the leader of the group. Alex and the team were tasked to expose a syndicate of eight collaborators that were secretly involved in orchestrating the hostage crisis. After a national scandal involving the resignation of President Claire Haas along with the disbandment of the task force, Alex resorted to a final strategy. She released U.S classified intelligence to the public at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, implicating newly inaugurated President Henry Roarke in a deadly conspiracy. As a result of her actions at the Convention, she is branded as a fugitive of the United States. After being issued a Red Notice for her arrest by Interpol, she leaves the country with Ryan Booth on a plane to Thailand in order to evade the authorities. ===Liam O'Connor=== Josh Hopkins Liam O'Connor (portrayed by Josh Hopkins; season 1), a seasoned FBI agent who had a fling with Miranda Shaw in the past. Years ago, he and Alex's father had graduated from the FBI academy together and one of their first undercover operations in Omaha was a blown sting killing over 200 people. Years later, he worked a sting operation against some militia groups in Chicago. Just before the case went south, ending in a shootout with three confirmed casualties including Drew's fianc\u00e9e and unborn child, he had told Ryan that he would take the blame and that Ryan would be his replacement. However, it was later revealed that Ryan took the blame for the incident, later losing his position within the Bureau. One year prior to the Grand Central bombing, it was revealed that Liam was demoted from his position within the Bureau. However, Miranda pulled strings to allow him to work as an instructor at the Academy. During his time at the Academy, he had a one-night stand with one of the recruits, Alex, on New Year's Eve. Although Miranda discovered the incident, she was shortly dismissed prior to pursuing the misconduct case with Liam. Sometime later Liam was promoted to the position of Assistant Director, replacing Miranda's former role at the Academy. Months after Alex's cohort graduated from Quantico, Liam was assigned to work in a field office based in Washington. After the Grand Central bombing occurred, Alex was considered a main suspect in the case. As a result, he pursued her until she managed to clear her name. Three months after the Command Center bombing occurred, it was revealed that he testified against Elias Harper in the congressional hearing case. Later Miranda discovered that he was the true terrorist behind the two bombings in New York, right before he shot her. It was subsequently revealed that he had used hidden cameras and tracking devices to plan the bombings, and had gathered intelligence to blackmail Elias and frame both Alex and Simon. His objective was to destroy the Bureau before the organization got an opportunity to destroy the country. Initially, he tried to frame Miranda, but Alex and the others discovered his plan to plant a bomb at the FBI Academy, the day the new cohort were graduating. He was unsuccessful; the bomb was later defused by Simon's actions. Prior to that, he was killed by Alex and Ryan. ===Ryan Booth=== Ryan Booth (portrayed by Jake McLaughlin) is a former Marine and FBI Special Agent. During his time at Quantico, Ryan was undercover as a recruit, tasked to surveil Alex by Liam, but fell in love with her instead. Liam later revealed to him that he was, in fact, in retraining. During this time, he has a relationship with Alex. Afterwards, he takes over Miranda's role as staff counselor. After the Grand Central Terminal bombing, Ryan is working in the New York Office and is in a relationship with Natalie Vasquez and, along with their friends, helps Alex clear her name. However, when Alex persists in investigating when everyone believes Elias Harper was the terrorist, he becomes suspicious of her and is determined to stop her. After his ex-wife, Hannah Wyland, is suspended from active duty after an incident with Senator Haas, Ryan takes over her position under Liam's orders. He finally realizes Alex is innocent and helps the team find the true terrorist, Liam, and he and Alex shoot him. He and Alex reconcile thereafter, but their travel plans are thwarted by Alex's CIA job offer. In the future timeline, he becomes a CIA case officer after completing his training at Camp Peary. At the end of the second season, he is branded as a criminal and leaves the United States in order to evade the authorities. In season 3 he marries Shelby Wyatt (even though he still has feelings for Alex Parrish), as it is revealed in the premiere of the season. In this same episode Ryan tries to save Shelby, who has been kidnapped by The Widow (who will free her if he gives her a code Alex has). ===Miranda Shaw=== Aunjanue Ellis Miranda Shaw (portrayed by Aunjanue Ellis; seasons 1 & 2), Assistant Director of the FBI Academy at Quantico, director of the training program at Quantico and Alex's mentor.

After the Grand Central Terminal bombing, Miranda is one of the people who believes in Alex's innocence and takes great risks to help her. At the end of the first season, Miranda is named Deputy Director of the FBI. In the future, she is shown to be a representative of the terrorist group, the Citizens Liberation Front. Sometime later, Miranda is incarcerated in a federal prison due to orchestrating what appears to be an attempted murder of Alex Parrish at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. ===Caleb Haas=== Caleb Haas (portrayed by Graham Rogers; season 1, main; 2, guest) was an FBI trainee who originally flunked out of the Academy as an agent, but was brought back to train as an analyst, and then reinstated as an agent-trainee again.

During his time at Quantico, he uses the name Mark Raymond in an undercover operation to infiltrate Sistemics, in an operation coordinated with his father to lure out Sistemics' leader and Kentucky bombing suspect Dan Berlin. Prior to the Grand Central Terminal Attack, Caleb was stationed as an analyst in San Diego, but requested a transfer to New York. During the Command Center bombing, his father saved his life before he died when the building fell over him. As a result, Caleb became a drug addict and his mother locked him up at her home so he would not affect her election chances. Caleb left with Alex and he went through withdrawal, with Alex and Shelby's help. He later helped track down the true terrorist, Liam. In the second-season premiere, Shelby mentioned that he resigned from the FBI and commenced study at a law school in UC Berkeley. After the 2018 Hostage crisis ended, it was revealed that Caleb vacated in Tulum, Mexico prior to visiting his mother and brother in Washington, D.C.

The aggressive and secular Nimah desperately wants to be a special agent but is not quite up to the physical and mental challenge, while the more religious Raina is better suited to the role, but only entered training because Nimah wanted it so much. Eventually, they are allowed to be revealed to the NATs. The main physical difference between the two is that Raina wears the hijab and is a devout Muslim and Nimah doesn't and isn't. In the future timeline, Nimah and Raina are working undercover in a terrorist cell. Three months after the second bombing hit, Nimah is working as an agent in the New York branch, and Raina has left the FBI because Nimah reported her for being too emotionally involved with Hamza, whose terrorist cell they were infiltrating prior to the Command Center bombing. Raina initially moved home to Dearborn, Michigan, but later became a high-level diplomatic translator, while Nimah stayed on at the FBI. In the future, Nimah joins the terrorist organization, the Citizens Liberation Front, while Raina becomes the conference interpreter at the 2018 G-20 summit in New York.

Shelby's parents were supposedly killed on 9/11, when she was 16, leading her to join the FBI to try to stop future terrorist attacks within the United States. Shelby thought she had a half-sister named Samar Hashmi, who she sent money regularly until Caleb found out she was a con artist. Also with Caleb's help, she later learned her parents faked their deaths after unknowingly selling weapons software to the Taliban. Her parents meet her in Canada, but Caleb discovered they were only interested in conning more money from her. Though Caleb tried to protect her from the truth, when she learned it, she contacted Deputy Director Haas to bring them to justice. She had a relationship with Caleb in the Academy, and later, she had an affair with Caleb's father, FBI Deputy Director Clayton Haas, before he was killed in the second bombing.
