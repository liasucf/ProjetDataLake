The mill had been bought by miller Auke Sietzes Penninga to replace the smock mill De Westenberg, which had burnt down on 13 April 1900. The new mill was named De Jonge Wester but was known locally as Penninga's Molen. It worked until 1936, or 1938. It is said to have been worked occasionally during the Second World War, but was otherwise used as stables. By the 1960s, the mill was derelict. The Stichting de Penninga's Molen () was established in 1966. It purchased Penninga's Molen in 1970 for \u01921. In 1970-71, the mill was restored by millwright Y Schakel of Exmorra.

The windshaft originally in Penninga's Molen is now fitted to Sint Annamolen, Nijmegen, Gelderland. The mill was officially opened on 10 May 1972 by Commissioner to the Queen H Rijpstra. The mill serves as a training mill for the Gild Fryske Mounders (.
