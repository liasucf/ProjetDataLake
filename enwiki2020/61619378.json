Established on 27 August 2019, the club replaced Pune City after they were disbanded and their franchise rights were sold to Telangana businessman Vijay Madduri and former Kerala Blasters FC CEO Varun Tripuraneni. Hyderabad began their first professional season in October 2019. Alongside Madduri and Tripuraneni, actor Rana Daggubati also serves as a co- owner of the club. On the 16 of June 2020, German club Borussia Dortmund struck a partnership deal with the club for grassroots development. Manuel Roca is the current Hyderabad head coach, taking over on 31 August 2020 replacing Albert Roca. Hyderabad play their home matches at the G.M.C Balayogi Athletic Stadium in the Hyderabad suburb of Gachibowli. The stadium has a capacity of 30,000 for matches. Hyderabad played their inaugural match on 25 October 2019, suffering a 5\u20130 defeat against ATK. The club completed their first season in the Indian Super League in 10th place, failing to qualify for the playoffs. ==History== ===Formation=== In February 2019, it was reported that Indian Super League side Pune City were struggling financially and that their owners were looking to sell the franchise. The club reportedly were behind on paying players and had also attempted to discuss merging with local rivals Mumbai City. After the 2018\u201319 season, Pune City released all their players and participated in the Super Cup using academy players. On 26 August 2019, it was reported by the Hindustan Times that Pune City had disbanded and that former Kerala Blasters CEO Varun Tripuraneni had bought a majority stake in the club. Neither then Pune City CEO Gaurav Modwel or Tripuraneni confirmed the reports. However, the next day, on 27 August 2019, it was announced that Hyderabad would replace Pune City for the 2019\u201320 season, with Tripuraneni and businessman Vijay Madduri buying the ownership rights to the franchise. The club's branding and first kits were then revealed prior to their first season on 29 September 2019. ===Inaugural season=== On 29 August 2019, it was announced that Phil Brown, the last head coach of Pune City, would be the first head coach for Hyderabad. In late September, just before the start of the 2019\u201320 season, it was revealed that Hyderabad had signed almost every player from Pune City's final squad. The club played their first ever match on 25 October 2019 against ATK at the Salt Lake Stadium. They were defeated 0\u20135 in a match which Brown described as \"not our usual standards\". Hyderabad then succumbed to defeat again in their second match against Jamshedpur. Marcelinho scored the first goal for the club's history but could not prevent his side's 1\u20133 defeat. The club finally earned their first victory in their third match on 2 November 2019 against the Kerala Blasters. This was also Hyderabad's first home match. Goals from Marko Stankovi\u0107 and Marcelinho helped Hyderabad to a 2\u20131 victory. On 11 January 2020, with the club in last place in the table, with just one victory and two draws from 12 matches, Brown and the club decided to part ways. Former India international Mehrajuddin Wadoo took over as caretaker for one match before assistant coach Xavier Gurri L\u00f3pez became interim coach for the rest of the season. The club finished their season with a 5\u20131 victory over NorthEast United on 20 February 2020. Overall, the club finished the season in last place and failed to qualify for the ISL playoffs. ==Crest and colours== The team colours and logo for Hyderabad were unveiled on 21 September 2019. The club colours are black and yellow. According to the club, the logo is titled \"Reliving Hyderabad's Football Legacy\" and is meant to represent Hyderabad and the city's heritage. The logo features the minarets from the Charminar mosque in the city and Koh-i-Noor diamonds. According to Hyderabad co-owner Vijay Madduri, the logo \"is inspired from the city\u2019s history, we now hope that HFC will be a great boost for the sport in the region\u2026 we can give a boost to the legacy that is already present in the city\u2019s history and roots.\" ==Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:center\" |- !Period !Kit manufacturer !Shirt sponsor |- | 2019\u20132020 | Reyaur Sports | None |- |2020\u2013present |T10 Sports | TBA |- |} ==Stadium== Balayogi Athletic Stadium in 2012 Hyderabad play their home matches at the G.M.C Balayogi Athletic Stadium, located in the Hyderabad suburb of Gachibowli. A multi-purpose stadium, the stadium is mainly used to host football matches and was built in 2002 prior to the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. The stadium used to host matches for Fateh Hyderabad in the I-League 2nd Division but the club relocated after saying that the \"pitch was not in good shape\". Prior to Hyderabad's first season, the grass was relaid and the stadium was renovated and cleaned in anticipation of the 2019\u201320 season. ==Ownership== The current co-owners of Hyderabad are Vijay Madduri, Varun Tripuraneni, and Rana Daggubati. Madduri, the chief executive officer of the Hyderabad-based company Incessant Technologies, said that he was looking forward to his \"significant role in developing football in the state, reviving its past glory\". Tripuraneni is the former CEO of the Kerala Blasters, another Indian Super League side. During the club's announcement, Tripuraneni said \"It is a proud moment for me, to be co-owner of Hyderabad FC. Hyderabad is a city with great football culture. I look forward to working with key stakeholders and building a strong foundation for the club, which will eventually contribute to society and do the city proud. Our immediate task is to prepare for the new season\". On 24 October 2019, it was announced that prominent Telugu actor Rana Daggubati would also join Madduri and Tripuraneni as a co-owner of the club. After acquiring ownership, Daggubati stated \"Hyderabad has a great legacy with the sport. This team, therefore, is a chance to rekindle that legacy.\" ==Players== ===First- team squad=== ===Former players=== ===Reserves=== ==Coaching & Technical staff== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
