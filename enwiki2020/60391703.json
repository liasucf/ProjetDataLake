    "text": "Padillothorax is a genus of southeastern Asian jumping spiders first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1901. it contains only two species. ==Taxonomy== First described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1901, Padillothorax was synonymized with Stagetillus by Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski in 1987. Stagetillus was placed in the tribe Baviini, part of the Salticoida clade of the subfamily Salticinae by Wayne Maddison in 2015, on the basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence, although only a single unidentified species of Stagetillus from Selangor was included in the analysis. In 2017, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski recognized the genus again, but did not include the type species, Padillothorax semiostrinus, so his action was not valid under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. He included this species in 2018, thus successfully reviving the genus. He also transferred a species included in Padillothorax by Reimoser in 1927 to a new genus Padillothorus, leaving two species in Padillothorax. ===Species=== , the World Spider Catalog accepted two extant species: *Padillothorax semiostrinus Simon, 1901 \u2014 Malaysia (peninsula) *Padillothorax taprobanicus Simon, 1902 \u2014 Sri Lanka ==References== Category:Salticidae genera Category:Salticidae ",
