The driver of the van tried to overtake a trailer truck but collided with a Partas provincial passenger bus along MacArthur Highway in Barangay San Julian, Moncada, Tarlac. He was declared dead on arrival at the Rayos-Valentin Hospital in Paniqui, Tarlac at 12:10 a.m. Initial reports said that the cause of his death was \"multiple head injuries\". The autopsy, however, revealed that his broken ribs pierced his heart and lungs thus causing his death. Perez's funeral was held at La Salle Green Hills chapel on April 17\u201318 before he was transferred in The Christ the King Parish along Greenmeadows Avenue in Quezon City on April 19\u201326, 2011.

His favorite blanket, a pair of rubber shoes, and a watch he gave his younger brother were reportedly placed inside the casket. ABS-CBN filed a case of reckless imprudence on the driver of the van that carried Perez and four others. The driver was an employee of Southbend Express Services, Inc., a service contractor of ABS-CBN. Perez's family wanted to donate his corneas to blind singer Fatima Soriano after his mother saw her interview with Boy Abunda in The Bottomline. However, Soriano's doctor explained this was not possible because Soriano's problem was her retinas, and only corneas can be transplanted. Perez's corneas were eventually donated to a 28-year-old man and an 8-year old-boy. In August 2011, the Eye Bank Foundation of the Philippines posthumously honored Perez as the foundation's poster boy. The event was attended by the Perez family and the recipients of the actor's corneas. == Filmography == === Television === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
