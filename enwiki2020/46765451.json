His colleague Dieter Hofrichter remembered him as being particularly interested in revivals of classic designs: \"His early typefaces were his own designs \u2014 in the 1950s he made several fonts in the style of the times, mostly calligraphic in character. At some point he stopped doing original designs and went on to produce only new editions of classic faces, or to revise \u2014 and usually improve \u2014 designs by others. In fact, Lange was not very interested in new designs. He simply wanted the fonts that were released to be very well made \u2014 in particular the \u201cclassics\u201d. That was his main ambition: any fonts that were submitted were improved under his scrutiny.\" == Typefaces == * Arena (1959) * Solemnis (1954) * Boulevard (1955) * Champion (1957) * El Greco (1964) * Concorde (1968) * Concorde Nova * Imago * Akzidenz Grotesk Buch, an updating incorporating ideas from Helvetica * Franklin-Antiqua * Garamond (re-cut) * Walbaum (re-cut) * Caslon (re-cut) * Berthold Script * Berthold Imago * Baskerville (re-cut) * Bodoni Old Face * Whittingham == References == Category:1921 births Category:2008 deaths Category:German typographers ",
