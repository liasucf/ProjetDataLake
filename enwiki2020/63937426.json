    "text": "The gens Statia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the early decades of the Republic, but the name does not appear again in history until the time of Cicero. The Statii remained relatively undistinguished until the reign of Trajan, when Lucius Statius Aquila was raised to the consulship.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 901 (\"Statia Gens\"). ==Origin== The nomen Statius is of Oscan origin, and most of the Statii appearing in history before the late Republic were from Samnium or Lucania. Statius is a patronymic surname, derived from the Oscan praenomen Statius, without any change in morphology.Chase, pp. 136\u2013138. ==Praenomina== The Statii used only the most common of praenomina: Lucius, Lucius, Marcus, Publius, Quintus, Titus, and Sextus, of which the first five were the most abundant at all periods of Roman history. Of these, the Statii used primarily Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus. ==Members== * Titus Statius, tribune of the plebs in 475 BC, along with his colleague, Lucius Caedicius, brought Spurius Servilius Structus to trial for his conduct of the battle against the Veientes at the Janiculum as consul the previous year. Servilius spoke vigorously in his defense, and with the support of his colleague, Aulus Verginius Tricostus, he was acquitted.Livy, ii. 52.Dionysius, ix. 28\u201333.PW, \"Statius\", No. 4.Broughton, vol. I, p. 28. * Statius, one of the Samnite generals during the Social War, was afterward given Roman citizenship and admitted to the Roman Senate. Because of his wealth, he was proscribed by the triumvirs in 43 BC, though he was then eighty; after opening his doors and dispersing his fortune to all takers, he set his house alight, and perished; the fire then spread to adjacent parts of Rome. Some scholars identify him with Gaius Papius Mutilus, but others reject this identification.Appian, Bellum Civile, iv. 25.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 901 (\"Statius\", No. 3).PW, \"Statius\", No. 1. * Statius, a freedman of Quintus Tullius Cicero, whom his brother Marcus felt too self-important, and too free with his opinions.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, ii. 18, 19, vi. 2, xii. 5, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem, i. 2, 3, Epistulae ad Familiares, xvi. 16.PW, \"Statius\", No. 2. * Sextus Statius, a merchant recommended by Pompeius for a prefecture by Cicero when the latter was Proconsul of Cilicia in 51 BC. Cicero declined to appoint Statius on principle, and anticipated Pompeius' dissatisfaction with his choice.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, vi. 1.PW, \"Statius\", No. 3. * Statius Sebosus, a geographer whose work was cited by Pliny the Elder. He might be the same Catulus mentioned by Cicero as a friend of Catulus.Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, vi. 29. s. 35, 31. s. 36, ix. 15. s. 17.Solinus, 52.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, ii. 14, 15.PW, \"Statius\", No. 28. * Statia Q. f.

He may be the same potter whose mark is found on the remains of some statuary from Pompeii.PW, \"Statius\", No. 31. * Lucius Statius Ursulus, a native of Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis, was a teacher of rhetoric in the time of Nero.Suetonius, De Claris Rhetoribus, p. 99 (ed. Reifferscheid).PIR, S. 644. * Statius Proxumus, a tribune in the Praetorian Guard during the reign of Nero, and one of those secretly plotting the emperor's murder in AD 65, was sent to arrest and slay Plautius Lateranus, the consul designate, whose role in the conspiracy had been discovered. To his credit, Lateranus went to his death without exposing his executioner's role in the affair. At some point, Statius' participation was discovered, but he was pardoned. Tacitus implies that he vainly put an end to his own life, or in some way met his end through his own foolishness.Tacitus, Annales, xv. 50, 60, 71.PW, \"Statius\", No. 20.PIR, S. 639. * Statius Domitius, or Domitius Statius, a tribune in the Praetorian Guard, who was removed from his position because he was suspected of being a participant in the Pisonian conspiracy.Tacitus, Annales, xv. 71.PW, \"Statius\", No. 8.PIR, S. 629. * Statius Murcus, or perhaps Staius Murcus, like Caesar's legate, was one of two soldiers sent by Otho in AD 69 to kill Nero's heir, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus.Tacitus, Historiae, i. 43.Plutarch, \"The Life of Galba\", 27.PW, \"Statius\", No. 15.PIR, S. 634. * Statius Sabinus, a friend of Pliny the Younger, and perhaps a relative, for both were among the heirs of a certain Sabina. Statius asked Pliny for advice concerning a slave named Modestus, whom Sabina apparently intended to order manumited in her will, but on consulting with experts Pliny found that Sabina's intention had no legal effect. He nonetheless advised, and trusted that Statius would agree, that if they were worthy of Sabina's trust, then they should carry out her intention by freeing Modestus.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, iv. 10.PW, \"Statius\", No. 27.PIR, S. 642. * Lucius Statius Aquila, consul in AD 116, during the reign of Trajan.Fasti Ostienses, . * Gaius Statius Capito Arrianus, one of the sons of senatorial families appointed to assist the Arval Brethren in AD 117. He was probably the same as Lucius Statius Capito, named in the same position for 118, and the brother of Gaius Statius Cerealis, who performed the same function in 120., .PW, \"Statius\", No. 6.PIR, S. 627. * Gaius Statius Cerealis, one of the sons of senatorial families appointed to assist the Arval Brethren in AD 120.

Priscus Licinius Italicus, governor of Dacia, then consul in AD 159. He was subsequently governor of several other provinces, including Moesia Superior, Britannia, and Cappadocia.
