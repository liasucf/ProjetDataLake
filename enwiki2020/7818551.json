Srirangam Sheshadri Chary (Brahmanandam), one of Shankar's employees, calls Narayana and tells him that Shankar is trying to kill Babloo. Narayana cames and tells the goons to let Babloo go. One of Shankar's henchmen, who is also his right hand (Brahmaji), cheats him. Shankar fires Babloo and tells him to never come back because he thinks that Babloo and Pooja fell in love with each other.

When Ballu and his henchmen are there, Brahmaji gives Shankar a gun to shoot him, and he does. However, the gun does not have bullets, and Shankar is shocked to see that Brahmaji has been working for Ballu all along. Ballu tricks Shankar, and according to his plan, he planned to handover Shankar & pooja. Shankar, in a fit of rage, kills almost all of Ballu's henchmen, including Brahmaji, but he is brutally injured, and Ballu finally kidnaps Pooja. Chary knows about this and tells Babloo that Shankar is injured and Pooja is abducted by Ballu.
