    "text": "National Geographic Video is an educational video series founded by the National Geographic Society. ==History== The oldest video footage from National Geographic was a failed attempt to reach the North Pole in 1903 known as the Ziegler Polar Expedition. The National Geographic Society expanded from just being primarily a print based organization to educating people about the world we live in by making videos. In 1996, Tim T. Kelly engineered the launch of the National Geographic Channel and has been recognized for leading the National Geographic Society into a global production of multimedia in television and other digital media. National Geographic Video consists of National Geographic Explorer, National Geographic Specials, National Geographic Television Special, National Geographic Kids Video, and more. The videos produced by National Geographic Video were originally viewed on television shows, Betamax, LaserDisc, VHS, DVD, and are now available to stream online. The National Geographic Society later went on to launch the National Geographic American TV channel, on January 12, 2001. National Geographic Wild, the European TV channel, was launched on August 21, 2006. National Geographic Explorer first aired on television on April 7, 1985 and changed its name later in 2005 to simply just Explorer. National Geographic Kids Video produced several video series like Really Wild Animals, Amazing Planet and Geo Kids which was aimed at educating kids in a fun and interactive way. National Geographic Special first aired on television on September 10, 1965 and showed Willi Unsoeld, Tom Hornbein, Barry Bishop, Jim Whittaker, and Lute Jerstad in \"Americans on Everest\". {|
