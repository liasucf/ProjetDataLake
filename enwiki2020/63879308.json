Wine rue (Ruta graveolens) Acridone alkaloids are natural products derived from acridone. == Occurrence == Acridone alkaloids are found in bark, wood, leaves and roots of rue plants, especially in roots and suspension cultures of rue. == Examples == This group is named after the acridone. Further members are acronycin, melicopicin and rutacridone, among others: > Acronycine Structural Formula V1.svg|Acronycin Melicopicine Structural > Formula V1.svg|Melicopicin Rutacridone Structural Formula V1.svg|Rutacridon == Properties == Many acridone alkaloids are methylated on the nitrogen atom and also have two oxygen functional groups, which can be free, alkylated or incorporated into rings. Acridone alkaloids show a blue-green fluorescence so that they can be detected with UV light. Some alkaloids of this group are effective against malaria pathogens. Furthermore, acronycin inhibits cell division. == References == Category:Alkaloids by chemical classification ",
