The ethnonym is related to that of the Goths (Gutans), and both names were originally Proto-Germanic *Gutaniz. Their language is called Gutnish (gutniska). Sn\u00f6bohm, Alfred Theodor Gotlands land och folk (1871) They are one of the progenitor groups of modern Swedes, along with historical Swedes and Geats. ==Name== The name of the Gutes in Old West Norse is Gotar, which is same as that used for the Goths. Old Norse sources such as the sagas do not distinguish between the Goths and the Gutes.\u00fe\u00e1ttr af Ragnars sonum, fornladarsagaS\u00f6gubrot af nokkurum fornkonungum \u00ed Dana- ok Sv\u00edaveldi, fornaldarsagaOl\u00e1fs saga helga, konungasagaEdda, Snorri Sturlusson, Skaldsk\u00e1parm\u00e1lEdda S\u00e6mundar, Grimnism\u00e1l In accordance, the Old East Norse term for both Goths and Gutes seems to have been Gutar.Vikingarnas Spr\u00e5k, Rune Palm p 30 Only the Goths and Gutes bear this name among all the Germanic tribes, even if Geat is closely related. The fact that the ethnonym is identical to Goth may be the reason why they are not mentioned as a special group until Jordanes' Getica, where they may be those who are called Vagoths (see Scandza). However Ptolemy mentions the Goutai as living in the south of the island of Skandia, who could be identical to the Gutes, since the \"ou\"-spelling in Ancient Greek corresponds to the Latin and Germanic \"u\". ==History== The oldest history of the Gutes is retold in the Gutasaga. According to legend they descended from a man named \u00dejelvar who was the first to discover Gotland. \u00dejelvar had a son named Haf\u00fei who wedded a fair maiden named Hvitastjerna. These two were the first to settle on Gotland. Haf\u00fei and Hvitastjerna later had three children, Guti, Graipr and Gunfjaun. After the death of their parents, the brothers divided Gotland into three parts and each took one, but Guti remained the highest chieftain and gave his name to the land and its people.Guta Lagh med Gutasagan, Tore Gannholm, p 98-99 right|250px|thumb| It is related that because of overpopulation one third of the Gutes had to emigrate and settle in southern Europe: :Over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn't support them all. Then they draw lots, and every third person was picked to leave, and they could keep everything they owned and take it with them, except for their land. ... they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks. ... they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.Guta Lagh med Gutasagan, Tore Gannholm, s 98-99 Some scholars, as for instance Wess\u00e9n, Wenskus, Hoffman etc., have argued that this tale might be a reminiscence of the migration of the Goths. Certain linguists, as for instance Elias Wess\u00e9n, point out that there are similarities between Gothic and Gutnish that are not found elsewhere in the Germanic languages. One example is the use of the word lamb for both young and adult sheep, which is only seen in Gutnish and Gothic.Fornv\u00e4nnen 1969, Elias Wess\u00e9n Stora Hammars I stone Before the 7th century, the Gutes made a trade and defence agreement with Swedish kings, according to the Gutasaga. This seems to have been due to Swedish military aggression. Although the Gutes were victorious in these battles, they eventually found it more beneficial (as a nation of traders) to try to negotiate a peace treaty with the Swedes. It gives Awair Strabain as the man who arranged the mutually beneficial agreement with the king of Sweden and the event would have taken place before the end of the ninth century, when Wulfstan of Hedeby reported that the island was subject to the Swedes. Because of Gotland's central position in the Baltic Sea, from early on the Gutes became a nation of traders and merchants. The amount of silver treasure that has been found in Gotlandic soil during the Viking Age surpasses that of all the other Swedish provinces counted together, which tells of a traders' nation of indisputable rank among the North Germanic tribes. p 9 The Gutes were the leading tradesmen in the Baltic sea until the rise of the Hanseatic League. The Gutes were both yeomen farmers and traveling merchants at the same time: so-called farmenn. This was an exceptionally dangerous occupation during the Middle Ages, since the Baltic Sea was full of pirates. The Gutnish farmenn always had to be ready for battle. The division and organisation of the early Gutnish society shows a nation constantly ready for war. The \"ram\" seems to have been an early symbol for the Gutes, and is still seen on the Gotlandic coat of arms. ==Gallery== File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg| Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland File:J\u00e4rn\u00e5ldern, Lerk\u00e4rl, Nordisk familjebok.jpg|Clay pot from Swedish Iron Age, found on Gotland File:Trojeborg, Nordisk familjebok.png|Trojeborg, a stone labyrinth from Visby on Gotland ==Sources== The history of Gotland can be read in the book Gutasaga. The Gutasaga is a saga treating the history of Gotland prior to Christianity. It was recorded in the 13th century and survives in only a single manuscript, the Codex Holm B. 64, dating to ca. 1350. It is kept in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm together with the Gutalagen, the legal code of Gotland. It was written in the Old Gutnish dialect of Old Norse. ==See also== *Old Gutnish *Gutnish *Gutasaga *Gotland *Goths *Gothic language *Gothic alphabet *Swedes (Germanic tribe) *Geats *Danes (Germanic tribe) *Proto-Norse language *Old Norse *Viking *Norsemen *Hanseatic League *Scandinavian prehistory *Scandza *Scandinavia *Swedes *Swedish language *Sweden proper *Sweden *Danes *Danish language *Denmark *Norwegians *Norwegian language *Norway *Proto-Germanic language *Germanic peoples ==References== == External links == * Gutasaga * Gotlanders * The Gotlanders - The people of Gotland Island * History of Gotland and the Gotlanders ==Other sources== *Ferguson, Robert The Vikings: a history (New York City: Penguin Group. 2009) *Nerman, Birger Det svenska rikets uppkomst (Stockholm: 1925) Category:Early Germanic peoples Category:Goths Category:Gotland Category:North Germanic tribes ",
