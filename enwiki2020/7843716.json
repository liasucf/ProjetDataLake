Although his father was not religious, his mother Susanna was a devout Episcopalian. She carried the boy 50 miles on horseback to be baptised at her childhood home in Albemarle County. His paternal grandfather Edmund Cobbs was likewise a planter. He had married Sarah Lewis of Albemarle County and raised a large family.

A year later, on May 23, 1825, Bishop Moore ordained Cobbs as priest at Monumental Church in Richmond. Rev. Cobbs re-established or became rector of two parishes in his home of Bedford County: Trinity Church and St. Stephen's, and several others in the region.Parker p. 128 In 1837, Rev.

The city had become a major gateway for travel on the Ohio River and settlement of both the Midwest (which did not allow slavery pursuant to the Northwest Ordinance and subsequent state constitutions, but which adopted various legalisms to allow visiting slaveholders to continue to own enslaved individuals) and the non-seaboard South (from Kentucky across the Ohio River and further south into Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana). Cobbs owned enslaved people, as did his relatives who stayed in Virginia. In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, Rev. Cobbs had owned five enslaved individuals: two males and two females of between 10 and 23 years old, and a woman of between 24 and 34 years old.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Bedford County, Virginia, pp. 115-116 of 148.
