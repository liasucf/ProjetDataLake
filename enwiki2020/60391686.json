    "text": "Iberattus is a genus of jumping spiders (family Salticidae) containing the single species, Iberattus semiglabratus. It was first described by Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski in 2018, and has only been found in Portugal, Spain, and France. Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski separated Iberattus from Euophrys. The justification for doing so has been questioned, since it was based on the examination of a mixed collection of specimens where it was not clear whether the males and females belonged to the same species. Nevertheless, the genus is accepted by the World Spider Catalog . Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski et al. noted that although the male palpal bulb might place the genus in Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski's informal group \"euophryines\", the structure of the female spermatheca was different, leaving its detailed placement uncertain. ==References== ==External links== Category:Monotypic Salticidae genera Category:Salticidae ",
