    "text": "Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities are botanical groupings in the British National Vegetation Classification system. The calcifugous grasslands and montane communities of the NVC were described in Volume 3 of British Plant Communities, first published in 1992, along with the mesotrophic grassland communities and the calcicolous grassland communities. In total, 21 calcifugous grasslands and montane communities have been identified. The calcifugous grasslands and montane communities consist of the following groupings: * five grass-dominated communities which group together as \"sub- montane calcifugous grasslands\"; two of these, U1 and U2 are found throughout Britain, two more U4 and U5 are found throughout upland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and western England, and one, U3, is localised in southwest England. * a sixth submontane community, U6, dominated by Heath Rush Juncus squarrosus * four communities categorised as \"calcifugous vegetation of low- and middle-alpine snow-fields\", all of which are confined or nearly confined to Scotland: U7, U8, U11 and U12 * two moss- and rush-heaths of low- and middle-alpine plateaus U10, which is confined to Scotland, and U9 which is also found in northern England and North Wales * five communities grouped together as \"mesotrophic montane swards and herb-rich banks and ledges\": U13, U14, U15, U16 and U17; some of these are confined to Scotland while others extend into northern England or North Wales * four calcifuge fern communities, one of which, U20, is widespread; the remaining three (U18, U19 and U21) are confined to upland areas of northern and western Britain ==List of calcifugous grasslands and montane communities== The following is a list of the communities that make up this category: * U1 Festuca ovina \u2013 Agrostris capillaris \u2013 Rumex acetosella grassland * U2 Deschampsia flexuosa grassland * U3 Agrostis curtisii grassland * U4 Festuca ovina \u2013 Agrostris capillaris \u2013 Galium saxatile grassland * U5 Nardus stricta \u2013 Galium saxatile grassland * U6 Juncus squarrosus \u2013 Festuca ovina grassland * U7 Nardus stricta \u2013 Carex bigelowii grass-heath * U8 Carex bigelowii \u2013 Polytrichum alpinum sedge-heath * U9 Juncus trifidus \u2013 Racomitrium lanuginosum rush-heath * U10 Carex bigelowii \u2013 Racomitrium lanuginosum moss-heath * U11 Polytrichum sexangulare \u2013 Kiaeria starkei snow-bed * U12 Salix herbacea \u2013 Racomitrium heterostichum snow-bed * U13 Deschampsia cespitosa \u2013 Galium saxatile grassland * U14 Alchemilla alpina \u2013 Sibbaldia procumbens dwarf-herb community * U15 Saxifraga aizoides \u2013 Alchemilla glabra banks * U16 Luzula sylvatica \u2013 Vaccinium myrtillus tall-herb community * U17 Luzula sylvatica \u2013 Geum rivale tall-herb community * U18 Cryptogramma crispa \u2013 Athyrium distentifolium snow-bed * U19 Thelypteris limbosperma \u2013 Blechnum spicant community * U20 Pteridium aquilinum \u2013 Galium saxatile community * U21 Cryptogramma crispa \u2013 Deschampsia flexuosa community ",
