    "text": "Lambda Ursae Minoris (\u03bb UMi, \u03bb Ursae Minoris) is a star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is an M-type red giant with an apparent magnitude of +6.38 and is approximately 880 light years from Earth. Lambda Ursae Minoris is an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, a star that has exhausted its core hydrogen and helium and is now fusing material in shells outside its core. AGB stars are often unstable and tend to pulsate, and Lambda Ursae Minoris is classified as a semiregular variable star and its brightness varies by about 0.1 magnitudes. Its variability was discovered from Hipparcos astrometry and it was entered into the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in 1999. == References == == External links == * * LAMBDA UMI (Lambda Ursae Minoris) \u2013 Jim Kaler Ursae Minoris, Lambda Category:Ursa Minor (constellation) Category:M-type giants Category:Semiregular variable stars 7394 183030 BD+88 0112 084535 ",
