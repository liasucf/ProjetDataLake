And the mysterious Johann, the owner of a photo studio, in the basement of which a certain photographic theater of the Marquise de Sade was created. Where are photographic postcards with the humbled nakedness of the human body, causing lust and gloating triumph of power. The look of a photographer who knows how to see angel curls and a sweet smile in a girl, and the same look that corrupts the body, the look of a pornographer. Over and over again, Johann destroys the well-being of families and turns ordinary people into freaks, seized with the scent of vice ... ==Premise== Filmed initially in black and white, then entirely in sepia tone, this film set in turn of the century Russia is centered on two families and their decline at the hands of one man, Johann, and his pornographic endeavours.
