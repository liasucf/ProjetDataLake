    "text": "The Zasavica (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0417\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430, ) is a river in the region of Ma\u010dva, western-central Serbia. The Zasavica is a 33.1 km-long right tributary to the Sava river which entirely flows through the region of Ma\u010dva. It originates from the several streams out of the swamps north of the village of Sala\u0161 Crnobarski, in the floodplain of the lower course of the Drina river. The river flows in the north-east direction, for 10 km parallel to the flow of the Sava and next to the villages of Glogovac, Sovljak, Crna Bara, Banovo Polje and Radenkovi\u0107, where the river crosses the administrative border of Central Serbia and the province of Vojvodina, where it flow near the settlements of Ravnje, Zasavica I, Zasavica II, No\u0107aj, and Ma\u010dvanska Mitrovica. At village Banovo Polje two major headstreams, Jova\u010da and Prekopac, meet and from that point the river is called Zasavica. Near the village of Zasavica, the river enters the marshy area of the Zasavica bog where the 50\u201360 metres wide stream spreads to almost 300 meters and gets 2 metres deep, and meanders through the middle of it until it flows into the Sava at Ma\u010dvanska Mitrovica, right across the town of Sremska Mitrovica on the Sava. The final section is channeled (Bogaz canal) and the river often floods the surrounding area. The name of the river could be translated as the \u201cbehind Sava\u201d. It actually flows through the typical elongated \"mrtvaja\" (oxbow), the old (fossil) bed of both the Sava and later, the Drina rivers. Because of the river\u2019s meandering course and the low terrain, a bog was created, while the river itself changes the course depending on how much atmospheric waters it gets during the year. ==References== Category:Rivers of Serbia Category:Geography of Vojvodina Category:Ma\u010dva ",
