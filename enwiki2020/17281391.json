    "text": "The Smith Hill Historic District is a historic district located in northwestern Providence, Rhode Island, just west of the Rhode Island State House and Interstate 95. It includes 57-65 Brownell Street, 73-114 Holden Street, 23-80 Jewett Street, 189-240 Smith Street and 10-18 W. Park Street. This area is a densely built residential section, an isolated remnant of what was once a larger residential area. Most of the 41 properties are residential units built between 1870 and 1930, and are typically 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 stories in height. They are set on lot sizes ranging generally from 3000 to 5000 square feet, and are set close to the sidewalk. The only major non-residential buildings are St. Patrick's School at 244 Smith Street and \"The Mohican\" at 185-189 Smith Street; the latter is an Art Deco brick and concrete commercial block two stories in height. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Historic districts in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Geography of Providence, Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Providence, Rhode Island Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island ",
