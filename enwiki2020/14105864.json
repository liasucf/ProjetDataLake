Lord Hawarden married Jane, daughter of Patrick Crawford Bruce, in 1811. She died in 1852. Hawarden survived her by four years and died in October 1856, aged 76. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only son Cornwallis, who was created Earl de Montalt in 1886. ==Notes== ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
