    "text": "The One More Light World Tour was the ninth headlining (eleventh overall) concert tour by American rock band Linkin Park. The tour supported their seventh studio album, One More Light (2017). Beginning in May 2017, the tour visited 21 cities in South America and Europe. The North American leg of the tour was cancelled by the band on July 21, 2017, following the death of lead vocalist and frontman Chester Bennington the previous day, while the final leg of the tour in Japan was cancelled on October 3, 2017. ==Background== Starting October 2016, the band announced several music festival appearances in Argentina, France and Germany. Throughout the remainder of the year, more shows were revealed. In March 2017, a promotional trailer was released on YouTube to promote standalone concerts in the U.K. This was followed by the band performing several promotional concerts and press interviews. The band announced the North American tour with a comical trailer which was released through Genius. The trailer showed Machine Gun Kelly being interviewed and Bennington and Shinoda intervening and asking him to tour with them, resulting him to leave the interview in amusement. Another comical video, for the promotion of Blink-182 co-headlining shows, known as \"Welcome to Blinkin Park\". The video included a couple on a tinder date taking Linkin Park and Blink-182 with them to decrease the awkwardness. Tickets for the North American leg are sold through Ticketmaster's new \"Verified Fan\" program, an initiative to help prevent ticket scalping. The band announced $1 from each ticket sale will be donated to \"Music for Relief\", a charity foundation to aid survivors of natural disasters and environmental protection. Each ticket will also include a physical or digital copy of the band's latest album. Commenting on the upcoming tour, guitarist Brad Delson stated: > \"Our fans know how much love we put into our live show. They know how much > we enjoy the connection when we play a fan favorite on stage. The emotional > and sonic content of this new batch of songs is going to bring a whole new > dimension to the show.\" On July 20, 2017, Chester Bennington died by suicide in his home in Los Angeles suburbs of Palos Verdes Estates, California. His final performance with the band was on July 6 at the Barclaycard Arena in Birmingham, England.\"Watch Linkin Park Perform With Chester Bennington for the Last Time\". Billboard.
