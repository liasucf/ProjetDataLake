He is a former WWE United Kingdom Champion and NXT Tag Team Champion. As well as being only one of three teenage champions, his win of the United Kingdom Championship at age 19 made him the youngest singles champion in WWE history, and its youngest inaugural champion. He and Trent Seven form the tag team \"Moustache Mountain\" and have collectively held the RPW Undisputed British Tag Team Championship in Revolution Pro Wrestling, the Progress Tag Team Championship in Progress Wrestling, the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas in Chikara, and the NXT Tag Team Championship. Bate, Seven, and Pete Dunne collectively form \"British Strong Style\". ==Professional wrestling career== ===Preston City Wrestling (2014\u20132015)=== Bate debuted in Preston City Wrestling as \"The Iron Master\" Tyler Bate at PCW Fright Night III, competing unsuccessfully in a 4-way match also featuring Charlie Garrett, Rich Swann and Zack Gibson.
