    "text": "Military anti-shock trousers, or pneumatic anti-shock garments (PASG), are medical devices used to treat severe blood loss. There is significant controversy over the use of MAST and most modern EMS and trauma programs have abandoned their use following data from a Cochrane review which indicated no mortality or survival benefit when MAST were applied to patients in shock. I. G. Roberts et al. sought to quantify the effect on mortality and morbidity of the use of MAST in patients following trauma, and published the data in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.Roberts IG, Blackhall K, Dickinson KJ. \"Medical anti-shock trousers (pneumatic anti-shock garments) for circulatory support in patients with trauma\".
