Rachel and older sister, Simone attended Alexandra College in Milltown, Dublin, which she attended from age three to 17. It was a three-month course at Ballymaloe that sparked her passion for food. It was while attending Ballymaloe Cookery School and learning from Myrtle Allen, Rachel started dating Myrtle's grandson, Isaac, when they were both aged 18. They married in 1998. The wedding took place at Cloyne Cathedral. The reception was at Ballymaloe House and they honeymooned in New York. After graduating from the school she cooked at the Ballymaloe House Hotel, eventually returning to teach at the school. It was when an RTE producer enrolled in a cookery course at the school asked Rachel if she would like to do a TV show. Allen lives at a seaside home in Shanagarry, County Cork with her husband Isaac, the son of television chef Darina Allen, and their three children, Joshua, Scarlett and racing driver Lucca Allen.
