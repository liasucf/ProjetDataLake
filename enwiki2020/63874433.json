Its exact age is not known, but it is said that when the construction of the railway line Skopje - Fush\u00eb Kosova - Mitrovica began, this oak was a small sapling near a freshwater spring. (It is known that the construction of this railway was completed in 1874). Near the oak, at the site of a former freshwater spring, there is now a well, which also gives the monument a hydrological character too. == See also == * Natural heritage * Natural monument == References == == External links == * Kosovo Environmental Protection Agency - Official Website Category:Individual oak trees Category:Trees of Kosovo ",
