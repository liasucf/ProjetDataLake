    "text": "Popping boba is a type of \"boba\" used in bubble tea. Unlike traditional boba, which is tapioca-based, popping boba is made using the spherification process that relies on the reaction of sodium alginate and either calcium chloride or calcium lactate. Popping boba has a thin, gel-like skin with juice inside that bursts when squeezed. The ingredients for popping boba generally consist of water, sugar, fruit juice or other flavors, and the ingredients required for spherification. Popping boba is a complementary food to bubble tea and frozen yogurt. It can serve as a topping for frozen yogurt and a substitute for traditional boba in bubble tea. == References == Category:Taiwanese drinks ",
