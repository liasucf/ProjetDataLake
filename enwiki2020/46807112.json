This was a tactic employed by Kurdish nationalist parties during the 2007 and 2011 election. In the latter, the Peace and Democracy Party candidates won 5.67% of the vote and 35 were elected since they contested the election as independents and rejoined the BDP shortly after taking their seats. The following parties have expressed intention of fielding independent candidates for the election. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"3\"|Party !! Leader |- | style=\"background:#000;\"| || HEPAR|| Rights and Equality Party || Osman Pamuko\u011flu |- | style=\"background:#093;\"| || H\u00dcDA-PAR || Free Cause Party || Zekeriya Yap\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu |} ==Electoral alliances== The following electoral alliances were made between parties in the run-up to the election. *The Labour Party (EMEP) announced support for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and did not contest the election. *The Great Union Party (BBP) and the Felicity Party (SP) announced that they would contest the election as a joint alliance under the name National Alliance (Mill\u00ee \u0130ttifak). The Nation and Justice Party (M\u0130LAD) planned to join the SP and BBP, but it did not actualise. The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates. *Two minor parties, namely the Revolutionary People's Party (DHP) and Socialist Workers' Party of Turkey (TS\u0130P) backed the Republican People's Party (CHP). *The Conservative Ascension Party (MYP) announced support for the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).http://www.mynet.com/haber/politika/myp-genel-baskani-oylarimiz- mhpye-1866103-1 The True Path Party (DYP) expressed its intention to form an alliance with six other parties in order to overcome the 10% election threshold. The party's leader \u00c7etin \u00d6za\u00e7\u0131kg\u00f6z met with the leaders of the Centre Party, Rights and Equality Party (HEPAR) and the Great Union Party (BBP). In the end, no alliance was formed. ==References== Category:June 2015 Turkish general election ",
