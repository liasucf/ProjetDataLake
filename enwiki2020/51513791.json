    "text": "Leontius (, ; 1801\u201323) was the Metropolitan of Belgrade between 1801 and 1813, during the Serbian Revolution. An ethnic Greek from Adrianople, Leontius was a disciple of Methodius, the Metropolitan of Belgrade between 1791 and 1801. Methodius was murdered, and some believe that Leontius was involved. Some also believe that he was involved in the murder of Vizier Had\u017ei Mustafa Pasha, which resulted in the Sanjak of Smederevo being ruled by the renegade Janissaries known as the Dahije. Leontius supported the Dahije, and had Serbian abbot Had\u017ei-Ruvim captured by them upon hearing that a rebellion was planned (see also Slaughter of the Knezes). After the Uprising against the Dahije broke out, Leontius worked to have the rebels give up and accept the Dahije. After having defeated the Dahije, the Serbian rebels turned on the Ottomans. In 1810 Leontius and Russian agent Konstantin Rodofinikin plotted against Kara\u0111or\u0111e. Leontius left Revolutionary Serbia in 1813. ==Annotations== Known as Leontije Lambrovi\u0107 (\u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u041b\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b) in Serbian. ==References== * * Category:19th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:Greek clergy Category:Greeks of the Ottoman Empire Category:Metropolitans of Belgrade Category:Bishops of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Category:People of the Serbian Revolution Category:People from Edirne Category:19th century in Belgrade ",
