Times of IndiaKaushik Ganguly seeks to explore dark abyss of human psyche | Business Standard News. Business-standard.com. 1 November 2014. == Story == Because of a taxi strike, a group of tourists, mostly unrelated to each other, get stuck in New Mal Junction. These people are honeymooners (Saheb and Mimi), family vacationers (Pallavi Chatterjee, Koushik Banerjee, Tridha Choudhury), an ailing mother and her son (Lily Chakraborty, Kaushik Ganguly), a priest (Ardhendu Banerjee), an actress and her abnormal brother (Gargi Roy Choudhury, Rajdeep Ghosh), one trekker (Kamaleshwar Mukherjee), a bus conductor (Rudranil), and a retired teacher (Maasud Akthar). One of the tourists, the priest manages to arrange a bus from the church for them to reach North Bengal. The other tourists also join him in the bus trip, but unfortunately the bus meets with a terrible accident. It falls off a cliff into an abyss, but the tourists survive with minor injuries. Injured and traumatized, they realize that they have become completely detached from any form of human contact. It was also not possible to climb 400\u2013500 ft so easily during the daylight hours that were remaining that day. So they decide to spend that night there and think they will try to find another way out the next day. While spending that night, they decide to play a game. The priest suggests a game which is to reveal everyone's secret or anything that the person wants to confess to the world but never gathered courage. This secret is to be left behind in the abyss and from the next day, they could begin afresh. Everyone agrees. Gradually, the situation starts to change while the game progresses. Everyone's darkest secrets are revealed one by one. This goes on until the wee hours of the night. At last, it is revealed that all the sixteen passengers of the bus actually died in that fatal accident. Their inner soul just does the thing by saying their guilt feelings in them to every one. == Cast == * Pallavi Chatterjee as Shiuli Jana, Meghna's mother * Ardhendu Banerjee as Church Father * Lily Chakravarty as Sabita, Khokan's mother * Rudranil Ghosh as Paltan * Gargi Roychowdhury as Aparna Banerjee * Kaushik Ganguly as Khokan * Bharat Kaul as Sidhartha, Doctor * Saheb Bhattacharya as Jeet, Punam's husband * Mimi Chakraborty as Punam * Tanushree Chakraborty as Moumita Paul * Tridha Choudhury as Meghna * Kamaleswar Mukherjee as Rajib, Trekker * Kaushik Banerjee as Mohan Jana, Shiuli's Husband * Rajdeep Ghosh as Avik, Aparna's Brother * Maasud Akthar as Tiwari Ji * Praytay Basu as Tito, Meghna's brother == References == == External links == * * Category:2010s Bengali-language films Category:2014 films Category:Indian films Category:Films about death Category:Bengali-language films Category:Films about the afterlife Category:Films set in West Bengal Category:Films directed by Kaushik Ganguly ",
