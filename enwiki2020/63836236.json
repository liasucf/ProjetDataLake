According to the list of maritime boundary treaties, this is the first agreement ever to be signed between the two countries, hence it introduces a new dynamic to the eastern region of the Mediterranean Sea. However, fears are expressed that the agreement may fuel an \"energy showdown\" in this region, because it is highly contentious. The legitimacy and the legal consequences of the accord have been disputed by a number of states in the region, as well as by the European Union. According to the European Union, the agreement \"infringes upon the sovereign rights of third States, does not comply with the Law of the Sea and cannot produce any legal consequences for third states\". Both Cyprus and Egypt have dismissed the deal as \"illegal\", while Greece regards it as \"void\" and \"geographically absurd\", because it ignores the presence of the islands of Crete, Kasos, Karpathos, Kastellorizo and Rhodes between the Turkish\u2013Libyan coasts. * * * In October 2020 UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres registered a Turkey-Libya deal on the delimitation of maritime jurisdiction areas in the Mediterranean. The agreement \"has been registered with the Secretariat, in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations,\" said the certificate of registration. Two months earlier (August 2020) Greece and Egypt had signed another maritime deal, demarcating an exclusive economic zone for oil and gas drilling rights, to counter the Turkey-Libya agreement. ==Turkish\u2013Libyan position== According to the Turkish Newspaper Daily Sabah, the new agreement consists of the establishment of 200 Nautical miles of EEZ, and an establishment of 18.6 nautical miles of Continental shelf. The Turkish position, according to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is that it is protecting its sovereign rights to the Blue economy and defending their legal claims to the disputed territory in the Mediterranean. Also, according to Anadolu Agency, EEZ boundaries' legality in the Mediterranean should be determined by continental shelves and mainland countries, rather than island based calculations. In Libya, the signing of the memorandum was met with varying responses: it was applauded by the supporters of the Government of National Accord, but rejected by supporters of both Khalifa Haftar and the House of Parliament based in Tobruk. Ahmad Al Mismari, the official spokesman of Haftar's forces, rejected the agreement and warned that \u201cmilitary force will be deployed to prevent any violation of Libyan sovereignty\u201d. Members of the Tobruk Parliament expressed similar sentiments, while its president, Aguila Saleh Issa, sent a letter to UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, describing the deal as \"null and void\". Saleh argued that the agreement should be ratified by the Tobruk Parliament, and that \"Libya and Turkey do not have common maritime boundaries\". ==EU and other opposing positions== European Commission Vice President Josep Borrell stated that the agreement signed by Turkey and Libya creates an infringement for third states, and does not comply with the Law of the sea. The president of The Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades aimed to create a diplomatic movement in order to nullify the Libyan-Turkish agreement. He has also stated that this movement would not include military options. Greece lodged objections to the UN and expelled the Libyan ambassador in response to the deal, infuriated at a pact which skirts the Greek island of Crete and infringes, its continental shelf.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-libya-turkey-un/greece-says-libya-turkish-deal-invalid-in-bad-faith-idUSKBN1YE15U The Israeli perspective offered by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs comments that the deal does not give sovereignty over the claimed waters to Turkey and Libya. Furthermore, it states that the third states were kept in the dark regarding the Libyan-Turkish agreement, hence leading to questions regarding its legitimacy. In a Joint Declaration issued on 11 May 2020, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt joined by France and the United Arab Emirates denounced the deal, arguing that it \"cannot produce any legal consequences for third States\", as it infringes upon the sovereign rights of Greece, and does not comply with the Law of the Sea. Turkey called the Joint Statement hypocritical by \"a group of countries who are seeking regional chaos and instability\". In August 2020, Egypt and Greece signed an agreement, designating an exclusive economic zone between the two countries. The announcement was made at a joint press conference with the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, stating inter allia that the deal established a partial demarcation of the sea boundaries between the two countries, and that the remaining demarcation would be achieved through consultations.* * * The parliaments of the two countries ratified the agreement swiftly, and in October 2020 Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed the deal, which was then published by the official gazette of the country. * Turkey dismissed the Greece - Egypt deal as \u201cnull and void\u201d, adding Greece and Egypt have no mutual sea border. ==Consequences== Following the agreement, Turkey and Libya's UN recognised government have seen an increase in co-operation. This cooperation ranges from Turkish off shore exploration efforts, to providing aid for the Government of National Accord, for the currently ongoing Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present). As the issues arising due to the dispute are still developing, the full consequences of this maritime dispute is yet to be seen. ==See also== * Aegean dispute * Exclusive economic zone of Greece * Cyprus\u2013Turkey maritime zones dispute * Mediterranean Basin ==Notes== ==References== Category:Libya\u2013Turkey relations Category:Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Category:2019 in Turkey Category:2019 in Libya Category:2019 in international relations Category:November 2019 events in Africa Category:November 2019 events in Asia Category:November 2019 events in Europe Category:Politics of Libya Category:Politics of Turkey Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of Libya Category:Treaties concluded in 2019 ",
