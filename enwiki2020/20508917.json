His nasab, 'Fanari', has been explained in different ways in the sources. It has variously been related to a town in Transoxiana, to a town near Bursa in Anatolia and to his father's profession as a lamp maker.Ayd\u0131n, \u0130.H. (2005).

He studied under Mevl\u00e2n\u00e2 Al\u00e2udd\u00een Esved, Cem\u00e2ledd\u00een Aksar\u00e2y\u00ee, Ham\u00eedudd\u00een-i Kayser\u00ee. He travelled to Egypt, which was then under the rule of the Mamluk Sultanate, to study Hanafi jurisprudence under Ekmeledd\u00een el- B\u00e2berti. Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I subsequently appointed Fanari judge (qadi) of Bursa in 1390. The death of Bayezid I precipitated a civil war, which caused Fanari to leave the country, after which he lectured in Egypt and in Hejaz (part of present-day Saudi Arabia). In 1421, Murad II ascended the throne as the sixth Ottoman Sultan and recalled Fanari to the court. Murad appointed him Sheikh ul-Islam in 1424, a position that he filled in addition to his other positions as professor and judge. He retained all three positions until the end of his life in Bursa in 1431. During his career, he specialized in logic and jurisprudence. His work on logic was reputed throughout the Islamic world. Some of his major writings are: * Sarh al-Isaguji or Al-Feva'id al-Fenariyye: Commentary on Ath\u012br al-D\u012bn al-Abhar\u012b's famous Is\u0101gh\u016bj\u012b fi al- Man\u1e6diq. * Mi\u1e63b\u0101\u1e25 al-Uns: Commentary on Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi's Mift\u0101\u1e25 al- Ghayb. * Fu\u1e63\u016bl al-Bad\u0101\u02bci\u02bb f\u012b u\u1e63\u016bl al-Shar\u0101\u02bci: A work in U\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh (Principles of Islamic jurisprudence).Ayd\u0131n, \u0130.H.
