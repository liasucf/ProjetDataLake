He was the son of Hachisuka Masatoshi. The Hachisuka clan were the kokujin of the Kait\u014d District of Owari Province (in present-day Ama District, Aichi Prefecture). They controlled water transport on the Kiso River. Their knowledge of local terrain made them useful to the Oda and Sait\u014d clans, although they remained independent of control of the powerful clans. Later, Masakatsu served Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and may have participated in the building of Sunomata Castle as well as the campaigns against the M\u014dri. In 1585, Hideyoshi awarded him Awa Province as a fief, but he declined in favor of his son, Iemasa, serving instead as a close adviser of Hideyoshi. ==Family== * Father: Hachisuka Masatoshi (d. 1553) * Mother: daughter of Yasui Shigeyuki * Wife: Matsu later Daishou'in (d. 1611) * Concubine: Hakun'in * Children: ** Hachisuka Iemasa by Matsu ** Narahime (d. 1606) married Kashima Nagamasa by Matsu ** Itohime (1571\u20131645) married Kuroda Nagamasa by Hakun'in == References == * Hachisuka Masakatsu (in Japanese) == Further reading == Category:1526 births Category:1586 deaths Category:Daimyo Category:Hachisuka clan Category:Toyotomi retainers ",
