Little Square) towards the junction with Westerplatte Street, where it continues as Kopernika Street. The Planty Park is located next to the junction. The street was outlined during when the settlement of Krak\u00f3w was granted city rights in 1257. Located east of the centre of Krak\u00f3w, the street served as a direct route towards to Ruthenia. The etymology of the street's name comes from the Church of St. Nicholas, located by the route. Locally, the street was named Rze\u017anicza Street (Ulica Rze\u017anicza) due to the numerous stalls selling meat. ==Features== {| |----- bgcolor=\"#FF 8C 00\" ! width=4% | Street No. ! width=26% | Short description ! width=10% | Picture |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 13-15 || align=\"center\"| Federal Print House (Drukarnia Zwi\u0105zkowa) - built between 1906 and 1907 under architect Rajmund Meus' designs.
