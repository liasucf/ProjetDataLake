    "text": "Frans Mostaert (1528-1560) was a Flemish Renaissance painter specializing in landscape paintings.Frans Mostaert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History ==Life== Landscape with the Good Samaritan Frans Mostaert was born in Hulst. The early biographer Karel van Mander states in his early 1605 Schilder-boeck that Frans Mostaert was the son of a common painter, the twin brother of the painter Gillis Mostaert and the grandson of the painter Jan Mostaert. Frans en Gillis Mostart in: Karel van Mander, Het Schilder-Boeck, Haarlem, 1604 While his brother Gillis studied landscape painting with Jan Mandijn, Frans became a pupil of the landscape painter Herri met de Bles. Van Mander states that both brothers joined the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1555. This may be one of the many errors of van Mander since Frans received a registered pupil in 1553.Van Mander also states that Frans Mostaert studied under Joachim Patinir but this statement is not accepted because Patinir is believed to have died before Mostaert was born, see: Max J. Friedl\u00e4nder, Landscape, portrait, still-life: their origin and development, Schocken Books, 1963, p. 56 It is therefore more likely that he became a master in the Guild earlier.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde van 1453-1615, edited and published by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1872-1876, p. 184 Frans Mostaert was the teacher of Jan Soens, Adriaen Rebbens and Bartholomeus Spranger. He died of the plague in Antwerp, after his new pupil Bartholomeus Spranger had been with him only for a few weeks. ==Work== A river landscape with a town, a palace and a church Frans Mostaert died young. Only very few of his works survive and only one is signed. This is the picture Landscape with the Good Samaritan in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp. A second work that has traditionally been attributed to Frans Mostaert is (was) in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. Christie's sold (14 November 2007 in Amsterdam, lot 60) the picture A river landscape with a town, a palace and a church, which it attributed to Frans Mostaert based on its similarities in style and technique with the compositions found in museums.Attributed to Frans Mostaert (Hulst 1528-after 1560 Antwerp) A river landscape with a town, a palace and a church at Christie\u2019s All of Frans Mostaert's known works are landscapes. Although he did not study under Patinir, he can be regarded as a follower of Patinir in that he combined realistic and topographical aspects of the landscape with a heroic aspect as shown in the mountain ranges.Paul Huys Janssen, Koenraad Brosens, 'Panorama op de wereld : het landschap van Bosch tot Rubens', Waanders, Zwolle, 2001 ==References== Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Hulst Category:1528 births Category:1560 deaths ",
