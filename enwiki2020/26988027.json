    "text": "Psilocarphus oregonus is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names Oregon woollyheads and Oregon woolly marbles. It is native to western North America from Washington and Idaho to Baja California, where it grows in seasonally wet habitat, such as vernal pools. ==Description== This is a small annual herb producing several stems just a few centimeters long which are coated in silvery or woolly fibers. The leaves are linear or lance-shaped and up to 2 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a small, spherical flower head only about half a centimeter wide. It is a cluster of several tiny woolly disc flowers surrounded by leaflike bracts but no phyllaries. Each tiny flower is covered in a scale which is densely woolly with long white fibers, making the developing head appear cottony. ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Flora of North America *Photo gallery Category:Gnaphalieae Category:Flora of the West Coast of the United States Category:Flora of British Columbia Category:Flora of Baja California Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Oregon Category:Flora of the Cascade Range Category:Flora of the Great Basin Category:Flora of the Klamath Mountains Category:Flora of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California) Category:Natural history of the Channel Islands of California Category:Natural history of the Peninsular Ranges Category:Natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Natural history of the Santa Monica Mountains Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges ",
