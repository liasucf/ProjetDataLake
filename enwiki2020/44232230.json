Recommended\".Yanow, S., Allmusic Review accessed October 28, 2014 Michael Toland wrote: \"Vibrations is practically a primer on sixties free jazz... Both horn blowers are in top form here, with Cherry blazing on the second version of 'Ghosts' like a man possessed and Ayler powering through the title track as in pursuit of the demons that did it. Vibrations is a fine introduction to the style for free jazz neophytes.\" Ethan Iverson wrote that Vibrations is \"well- recorded and has marvelous playing by all members of the quartet. Don Cherry's casual, unfettered melodies offset Ayler's fulminations perfectly; Gary Peacock's initial virtuosic salvo with Ayler remains one of the glories of his extensive discography.\" ==Track listing== All compositions by Albert Ayler. # \"Ghosts (short version)\" - 2:08 # \"Children\" - 6:53 # \"Holy Spirit\" - 8:30 # \"Ghosts (extended version)\" - 7:58 # \"Vibrations\" - 5:00 # \"Mothers\" - 7:06 ==Personnel== *Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone *Don Cherry - cornet *Gary Peacock - bass *Sonny Murray - drums ==References== Category:1966 albums Category:Albert Ayler albums Category:Freedom Records albums Category:Debut Records albums ",
