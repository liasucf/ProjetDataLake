Ra is a god of the Sun. Hotep means \"satisfied\". (Another meaning is 'Ra-peaceful', 'Ra-content'.) D21:D36-R4:X1*Q3 ==Biography== Rahotep\u2019s titles were inscribed on a magnificent statue of him which, with a statue of his wife, was excavated from his mastaba at Meidum in 1871 by Auguste Mariette.

Rahotep's older brother was Nefermaat I, and his younger brother was Ranefer. Rahotep died when he was young, and so his half-brother Khufu became pharaoh after Sneferu\u2019s death.Rahotep and Nofret Rahotep\u2019s wife was Nofret. Her parents are not known.
