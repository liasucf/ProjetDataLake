In 1998, he was called up to Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola's first team, who were then coached by Guillermo Y\u00e1var. The 1999 season marked the arrival of Juvenal Olmos as coach. He sent Miranda on loan to \u00d1ublense, then of the Chilean Third Division, in order for him to gain first team experience. He remained there for two years until being recalled by Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola in preparation for their 2001 season in Primera Division. He made his first team debut for Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola in the 2001 season against Colo-Colo, and became a regular starter for Union for the next years. In 2004, he was named co-captain prior to the team's Apertura campaign. During the 2005 Apertura, Miranda played a key role in guiding Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola to the 2005 Torneo Apertura. However, Miranda had already agreed a loan to Red Bull Salzburg of Austria for the rest of the 2005-2006 European season, preventing him in partaking in the 2005 Apertura play-offs, where Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola won their sixth national title in team history. Miranda made only 4 appearances for Salzburg before returning to Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola after the season's end. In 2006, he stayed with Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola throughout the 2006 Apertura before being sold to rivals Universidad Cat\u00f3lica at the start of the 2006 Clausura. ===Universidad Cat\u00f3lica=== After his transfer to UC, Miranda started in 11 games in defense during the Clausura, before injuring his ACL in his right knee, an injury that would keep him out for 9 months. He would go on to miss the 2006 Torneo Clasura where Universidad Cat\u00f3lica would bow out during the playoffs and all of the 2007 Apetura and its Torneo where Universidad Cat\u00f3lica lost to Colo-Colo in the final. He made his return during the 2007 Clausura where he made 11 appearances, 4 from the bench. Again, UC lost in the playoffs, after which, he left the club. ===Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola II=== In the off season, Miranda returned to Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola where he became a fixture in the back. After the retirement of Jos\u00e9 Luis Sierra before the 2009 Apertura he was named the new club captain. The team narrowly missed out on the title that season, losing to Universidad de Chile 3-2 on aggregate in the 2009 Torneo Apertura Finals. Because of their runners up finish, Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola qualified for the 2009 Copa Sudamericana, where they were eliminated by V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield in the Round of 16 by an aggregate score of 5-4. He continued to captain the side until the end of their 2010 Clausura. ===Columbus Crew=== On December 24, 2010 it was first reported by La Tercera on their website that Miranda had agreed to terms with American Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew. He made his Columbus debut on February 22, 2011 in leg 1 of the Crew's CONCACAF Champions League quarter-final series against Real Salt Lake.Crew, RSL finish scoreless in testy CCL opener His first league game with the Crew was on March 19, 2011 against DC United in the season opener.
