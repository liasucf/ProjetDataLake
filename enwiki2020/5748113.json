    "text": "Majora Carter (born October 27, 1966) is an American urban revitalization strategist and public radio host from the South Bronx area of New York City. Carter founded and led the non-profit environmental justice solutions corporation Sustainable South Bronx from 2001 onward, before entering the private sector in 2008. ==Early life== Carter was born in South Bronx, New York where she attended the Head Start Program and primary schools. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, she entered Wesleyan University in 1984 to study film and went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts. In 1997, she received a Master of Fine Arts from New York University (NYU). While at NYU, she returned to her family's home in Hunts Point, and later worked for The Point Community Development Corporation. While Associate Director of The POINT Community Development Corporation, Carter initiated the development of Hunts Point Riverside Park. Carter was \"pulled by her dog into a weedy vacant lot strewn with trash at the dead end of Lafayette Avenue. As the pair plowed through the site they ended up, much to Carter's surprise, on the banks of the Bronx River.\" From there, Carter secured a $10,000 grant from a USDA Forest Service program to provide seed money for river access restoration projects. Over a five-year period she worked with other community members and the Parks Department to help leverage that seed money into more than $3 million from the mayor's budget. The money was used to build the park into the Rudy Bruner award-winning iteration which re-opened in 2006. ==Career== ===Advocacy=== In August 2001, after exploring and then declining to engage in a campaign for NY City Council, Carter founded Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx), where she served as executive directorTheodore J.

During that time, SSBx advocated the development of the Hunt's Point Riverside Park which had been an illegal garbage dump. Carter was a co-founder of the Bronx River Alliance [bronxriveralliance.org], and SSBx continued to carry on Carter's involvement in Bronx River waterfront restoration projects. In 2003, Sustainable South Bronx started the Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training program,Sustainable South Bronx: Green Jobs, Not Jails Green for All.

Other SSBx projects have centered around fitness, food choices (including the creation of a community market), and air quality. Majora Carter in Hunts Point In 2007, Carter co-founded Green for All with Van Jones. A December 2008 New York Times profile called Carter \"The Green Power Broker\" and \"one of the city's best-known advocates for environmental justice\" but reported that some South Bronx activists (who would not go on record) stated that Carter has taken credit for accomplishments when others should share the credit as well as taking credit for uncompleted projects. Other Bronx activists (who did agree to be named) stated that her recognition was well deserved. Carter was a torch-bearer for a portion of the San Francisco leg of the torch relay of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Many portions of the torch relay, including the San Francisco leg, were met with protests concerning the policies of the Chinese government toward Tibet. Although Carter had signed a contract pledging not to use an Olympic venue for political or religious causes, when she and John Caldera were passed the torch during their part of the relay, she pulled out a small Tibetan flag that she had concealed in her shirt sleeve. Members of the Chinese torch security escort team pulled her out of the relay and San Francisco police officers pushed her into the crowd on the side of the street. Fellow torch-bearer, retired NYFD firefighter Richard Doran, who was making his own personal and political statement by wearing a helmet to refer to the firefighters who died in the September 11 attacks, called Carter's actions \"disgusting and appalling\" and said that he thought \"she dishonored herself and her family\". Another torch-bearer, retired NYPD police officer Jim Dolan, agreed with Doran. ===Media=== Majora Carter's TED talk was one of the first six publicly released talks to launch the TED.com website in 2006. Carter has made appearances in, and/or written, and produced television and radio programs, including HBO's The Black List volume 2, American Public Media's Market Place, and PRX's This I Believe series and has hosted several pieces on urban sustainability with Discovery Communications' Science Channel.

Accessed online June 17, 2007 The first season consisted of a series of 90 second op-eds shot in studio. The second season consisted of a series of short interview pieces with individuals taking uncommon approaches to environmental problems. In 2008, Carter and Marge Ostroushko co-produced the pilot episode of the public radio show, The Promised Land (radio), which won a 3-way competition for a Corporation for Public Broadcasting Talent Quest grant. The one-hour programs debuted on over 150 public radio stations across the US on January 19, 2009, was renewed for the 2010/2011 season, and earned a 2010 Peabody Award, but went unsupported by the public radio funding organizations after that period, and has since stopped production.

In the June 2010 issue of Fast Company magazine, Carter was listed as one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business. In 2014, B Corporation (certification) recognized MCG as one of the \"Best for the World\" according to its ranking among other B Corps of similar size. In 2012, Carter's consulting firm, Majora Carter Group LLC (MCG) accepted FreshDirect as a client to help the company and local organizations connect prior to its proposed relocation to the Harlem River Yards in the South Bronx.DNAinfo Activists opposed to the relocation, claimed New York City Government and FreshDirect failed to conduct sufficient environmental review and community outreach. A lawsuit and boycott campaign were initiated to stop the relocation. That lawsuit was dismissed, and a subsequent appeal was also dismissed; both were filed by New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. Sustainable South Bronx, an organization Carter founded, opposed FreshDirect's move to the Bronx. Subsequent votes by Bronx Community Board 1 and the NYC Industrial Development Agency both voted to approve the move to the Bronx. South Bronx youth development NGO leader Maryann Hedaa stated that Carter \"realizes that fighting poverty has to be a partnership between the public interests and the private interests.\"NY Daily News Regarding the negative attitude among Bronx activists towards Carter's position, Steve Ritz, founder of Green Bronx Machine, noted that \"It's much easier to run your mouth than run a business.\" The project broke ground Dec, 22, 2014 and was scheduled to be completed before the end of 2016. FreshDirect started hiring in the Bronx ahead of its move in anticipation. ===Tech-Economy Inclusion=== In 2007, while running Sustainable South Bronx, Majora Carter introduced MIT's first ever Mobile fab lab (digital fabrication laboratory) to the South Bronx, where it served as an early iteration of the \"maker spaces\" found elsewhere today.
