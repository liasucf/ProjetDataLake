    "text": "__NOTOC__ Grass Tree Conservation Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located in the state's Limestone Coast in the gazetted locality of Cadgee about north of the town centre in Naracoorte. The conservation park occupies land in section 451 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Hynam on the southern side of Boddingtons West Road. It was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 17 August 1972 for the purpose of protecting a stand of grass tree. While the crown land on which the conservation park was established had not been cleared for agricultural use, evidence of disturbance of the understorey in an open forest area and the associated presence of introduced grasses suggests that the land was \u201cpreviously grazed by domestic livestock.\u201d In 1992, the conservation park was described as follows. Firstly, the soils within the conservation park are reported as being located in the \u201cNaracoorte Environmental Association\u201d which is \u201ccharacterised by calcarenite dune ridges overlain by dunes or sheets of mobile sand.\u201d Specifically, the majority of the soils in the conservation park are \u201cdeep, acid, bleached sands with a yellow-grey B horizon\u201d while a minority consist of \u201cshallower alkaline sandy soils of a reddish colour.\u201d Secondly, land within the conservation park supported the following \u201cthree vegetation associations:\u201d # a \u201clow woodland \u201c of brown stringybark \u201cassociated with sandy soils of the stranded dune systems of the West Naracoorte Range,\u201d #an \u201copen forest - low open forest\u201d of pink gum associated with a stoney limestone rise in the central part\u201d of the conservation park and \u201can understorey generally consisting of introduced grasses and pasture weeds such as Cape weed (Arctotheca calendula);\u201d and #a \u201dsmall area\u201d of \u201copen forest\u201d of South Australian blue gum in the south-east in the conservation park's south-east with \u201can understorey of grass trees, Austral bracken (pteridium esculentum), and rice flower (Pimelea sp.).\u201d As of 1992, the conservation park had \u201cvery little visitor use.\u201d There were no facilities being provided for visitors apart from \u201cboundary access tracks\u201d of width to its west, south and east boundaries. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== ==External links== *Entry for Grass Tree Conservation Park on the Protected Planet website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast ",
