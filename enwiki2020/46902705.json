    "text": "Wang Fei (; born 22 March 1990) is a Chinese footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Chinese club Dalian Quanjian and the China national team. ==Club career== After spending years playing for several Chinese clubs, Wang Fei signed for Frauen-Bundesliga side Turbine Potsdam in December 2014. She became the first ever Chinese footballer to play in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Turbine's veteran manager Bernd Schr\u00f6der praised the impact made by Wang and compared her to respected German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer; however, Schr\u00f6der surprisingly selected departing goalkeeper Anna Felicitas Sarholz ahead of Wang for the 2015 DFB-Pokal final which ended in a 3\u20130 loss against VfL Wolfsburg. In September 2015, Wang transferred to Division 1 F\u00e9minine champions Olympique Lyon. In January 2016, she terminated her contract with the club; however, the club demanded for her return when M\u00e9line G\u00e9rard was injured. On 17 January 2016, Wang transferred to Chinese Women's Super League side Dalian Quanjian. In December 2017 Bayern Munich announced that Wang had agreed an 18-month contract with the Bavarian club, to commence 1 January 2018. ==International career== Wang played at the 2011 Summer Universiade and was the regular for China's gold medal-winning run. She made her debut for the Chinese women's national team on 24 November 2012 in a 2\u20131 win against Australia at the 2013 EAFF Women's East Asian Cup. Wang was also included in China's squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the tournament, Wang was described by FIFA as tall, agile and one of China's \"most impressive performers\" in the team's progress to the knockout stages. This was despite her playing through the pain of an injured shoulder which was sustained on 11 June 2015 in a 1\u20130 win against the Netherlands. In February 2016, Wang retired from China after getting into several confrontations with manager Bruno Bini and not being called up to the national team as a result. In February 2018, she was included in China's squad for the 2018 Algarve Cup. ==Honours== ===Club=== Dalian Quanjian *Chinese Women's Super League: 2016 ===International=== China PR national football team *Summer Universiade: 2011 *Four Nations Tournament: 2014, 2016 ==References== ==External links== * *Profile at 1.
