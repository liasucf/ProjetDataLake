Farrell, as well as Dalton Trumbo\u2019s novel \u2018\u2019Johnny Got His Gun\u2019\u2019. In college, his own radicalism\u2013and intellectual interests\u2013crystalized upon reading Daniel Aaron's Writers on the Left (1961). In the late 1960s, Wald became a \"devoted reader\" of New Left Review. In 1971, he ran for city council in Berkeley, California, for the Socialist Workers Party. In 1986, he co-founded the Marxist-Feminist- Antiracist \"Solidarity\" and continues to serve as an editor for its journal, Against the Current.

Throughout his nearly four-decade affiliation with the University of Michigan, his activism includes support for the: Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid, Latin American Solidarity Committee, Palestine Human Rights Campaign, and United Coalition Against Racism. On 16 March 1986, Wald was arrested for partaking in a \"sit-in\" at the office of Rep. Carl Pursell (R-Ann Arbor) to protest his support for President Ronald Reagan's plan to send $100 million to the counter-revolutionary Contras in Nicaragua. Wald was tried and convicted. As late as 1987, the \u2018\u2019New York Times\u2019\u2019 characterized Wald\u2019s political orientation as Trotskyist. His activism continues, demonstrated by his signature on a 2016 \"anti-intolerance statement.\" ==Personal== Wald identifies himself as having a \"secular Jewish identity.\" In 1975, he married Celia Stodola (1946\u20131992), who became a practicing nurse in the Obstetrical Unit of the Women's Hospital at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Sarah and Hannah are their two daughters. In 2001, he began a relationship with former student Angela D. Dillard, then a professor of African-American History at New York University.
