Active since the 1970s, Bresh has charted multiple singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. ==Biography== Bresh was born on February 23, 1948 in Hollywood, California as the son of country singer Merle Travis. As a child, Bresh began acting in films and recording his own music. He also worked as a movie stuntman at the Corriganville Movie Ranch. In 1963, he was a member of the rock and roll band The Crescents. It recorded an instrumental track \"Pink Dominos\" and issued it on a single with \"Breakout\" on the B-side. The single peaked at No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1964. He then released a 1970 solo single about D. B. Cooper which was withdrawn due to controversy over its subject matter. Starting in 1972, Bresh recorded for Kapp Records. His first charted single, \"Home Made Love\", made number six on the Hot Country Songs charts in 1976. This was included on an album of the same name for Farr Records. Due to the song's success, Bresh was nominated by the Academy of Country Music as Top New Male Vocalist that year. Bresh recorded two albums for ABC Records as well: Kicked Back in 1977 and Portrait a year later, both produced by Jimmy Bowen. Cash Box magazine reviewed Kicked Back favorably, saying that Bresh had \"[a] perfectly mellow voice and vital tracks with excellent material and interpretation\". Record World magazine published a positive review of Portrait, calling the album \"versatile\" and noting the variety of musical influences. Included on Portrait was a cover of \"Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)\" which featured Bresh performing thirteen different impersonations. Bresh hosted a weekly television variety show of his own creation, Nashville Swing, was a regular on the Merv Griffin Show and Dinah, and made a guest appearance on the TNN special A Salute to the Country Greats. As a producer, he has been employed by country legend Jerry Reed, classical guitarist Valerie DuChateau, and Merle Travis. As a videographer, Bresh has shot, produced, and edited projects for Hank Thompson, Lyle Lovett, Brooks & Dunn, George Jones, Tanya Tucker and Jerry Reed.Thom Bresh's official biography ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
