Smith also engages in formal public debates with prominent Muslim apologists and scholars including Omar Bakri Muhammad, Azzam Tamimi, Shabir Ally, Anjem Choudary, Abdur Raheem Green and Edip Y\u00fcksel. Smith believes that although both Islam and Christianity include radicals, moderates, and liberals, it is radical Muslims that commit violence as they take the Qur\u2019an seriously, while radical Christians who also take the Bible seriously serve others in love. He claims that radical Muslims model their lives on Muhammad, while radical Christians model their lives on Jesus Christ.Calvary Magazine: \"Confronting Radical Islam \u2013 Jay Smith was a featured speaker at the Calvary Chapel Missions Conference 2010\" Issue 43 Smith believes the growth in radical Islam in Britain is due to disaffected Muslims, often minimally religious, returning to their Islamic roots. He says that after reading the Islamic scriptures, (the Qur'an in conjunction with the hadith, tafsir, and sira), they come to the conclusion that the Salafi/Athari understanding is the true form of Islam. Smith also believes that although Western actions in the Islamic world can instigate Muslim discontent, it is the Islamic scriptures that encourage the violence. He also rues the fact that moderate Muslims are not able to challenge the radicals using scripture because he believes the radicals have the scriptural authority. Smith believes that ultimately Muslims and others will realize that the Muslim scriptures, coupled with the example of their prophet Muhammad, are irrelevant to modern times. Smith's polemical approach has been praised by the Salafi Omar Bakri Muhammad who states: ==References== *Pfander Films *Evangelium e Apoligia Ministries The Classical Debates \u2013 Jay Smith vs. Dr. Shabir Ally *Apologetics315 \"Apologist Interview: Jay Smith\" April 11, 2011 Category:Christian apologists Category:United Brethren in Christ clergy Category:Messiah University alumni Category:Fuller Theological Seminary alumni Category:Alumni of the London School of Theology Category:Living people Category:Christian critics of Islam Category:American critics of Islam Category:1954 births ",
