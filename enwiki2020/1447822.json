Its flagship program is the hour-long 6:00 pm state bulletin, produced by Nine's owned-and-operated stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. National bulletins also air on weekday mornings, weekend afternoons and most nights of the week after 10:30pm. In addition, a supplementary regional news program for the Gold Coast in Queensland and news bulletins for Darwin and Southern Cross Austereo-owned stations in regional Queensland, Victoria, Southern New South Wales and the ACT air each weeknight. Up until the mid-2000s, Nine News was generally the highest-rating news service in Australia, but in 2005 it was overtaken by the rival Seven News before it regained the lead on a national basis in 2013. The network's Director of News and Current Affairs is Darren Wick. ==National bulletins== ===Nine News: Early Edition=== Nine News: Early Edition is a half-hour bulletin airing at 5:00am on weekdays, presented from the network's Sydney studios by Alex Cullen, who also presenters Today show news. The bulletin was originally pre-recorded and was presented as the \"AM Edition\" of the Qantas Inflight News, a daily news bulletin for passengers of Qantas airways. Early morning bulletins were introduced in the early 1990s as Daybreak and, later, National Nine Early News until 2003 when Today was extended to begin at 6am. The Early News resumed for a brief time at 6am in 2005 and was presented by Sharyn Ghidella and Chris Smith before again being cancelled. Amber Sherlock and Alicia Loxley have previously presented the bulletin. In mid-2014, Julie Snook replaced Belinda Russell to present. After two years in the role, Julie Snook was promoted to the sports department and Lara Vella replaced her. In October 2014, a new era of the bulletin launched with its contract ending with Qantas. The bulletin was renamed Nine News: Early Edition with a dedicated 9news.com.au news feed on the right of screen, finance and weather flipper at the bottom, a look-ahead to Today and the presenter taking up less than three- quarters of the screen. There was a look at the newspaper front pages which showed the front pages of the two Sydney and Melbourne papers, The Australian, The Courier Mail and The Advertiser. There was even a live cross in which the bulletin prior to October was pre-recorded. ===Nine Morning News=== Nine Morning News airs at 11:30am on weekdays, presented from the network's Sydney studios by Mark Burrows (Monday) and Davina Smith (Tuesday - Friday).

Local editions were previously produced for the Perth and Queensland markets - in March 2014, a local Perth edition was launched, accompanying the launch of Today Perth, but it was axed later that year. Between 2014 and 2017, a local edition was provided for the Queensland market, replacing the national bulletin in full.

The bulletin was axed for a first time in 2008 due to budget cuts, before it was revived in 2009 and then axed again in 2010 due to declining ratings and commitments with televising live rugby league in the northern states, and Wimbledon in the southern states. ===Nine News Updates=== Short localised updates are presented during the afternoons by various state-based reporters or presenters.
