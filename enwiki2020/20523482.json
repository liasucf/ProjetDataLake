    "text": "The 2008 United States presidential election in Maine took place on November 4, 2008, and was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Maine is one of two states in the U.S. that instead of all of the state's 4 electors of the Electoral College to vote based upon the statewide results of the voters, two of the individual electors vote based on their congressional district because Maine has two congressional districts. The other two electors vote based upon the statewide results. See below in the section of Electors for more information. Maine once again displayed it status as a blue state, with Democrat Barack Obama taking the state with 57.71% of the vote and a difference of 126,650 votes. Maine has voted Democratic since 1992 and is the only state other than Nebraska to split its electoral votes, though it did not do so until 2016. It is also the only state in New England where a county voted for Republican John McCain, with Piscataquis County giving McCain roughly 50.7% of the vote. ==Caucuses== * 2008 Maine Democratic caucuses * 2008 Maine Republican caucuses ==Campaign== ===Polling=== Obama won every single pre-election poll. The final 3 polls averaged Obama leading 55% to 39%.Election 2008 Polls - Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections ===Fundraising=== John McCain raised a total of $465,676 in the state, while Barack Obama raised $2,205,059. ===Advertising and visits=== Obama spent $1,216,060 while McCain and the RNC spent $444,529. The Obama ticket didn't visit the state, but both McCain and Palin visited Maine once. ==Analysis== Maine is located in New England, an area that has become a hotbed for the Democratic Party. It was once a classic Yankee Republican state. It identified with the newly formed GOP in 1856 and stayed in the GOP fold for most of the next 132 years. The GOP carried the state in all but three elections (1912, 1964 and 1968) from 1856 to 1988. Additionally, Maine and Vermont were the only two states that voted against Franklin D. Roosevelt in all four of his campaigns. However, no Republican presidential nominee has carried Maine since George H. W. Bush in 1988, leading many analysts to reckon the state as part of the solid bloc of blue states in the Northeast. While George W. Bush seriously contested the state in 2000 and 2004, polls in 2008 never showed anything but a significant Obama lead. Ultimately, Obama won the state by a comfortable margin, taking 57.71% of the vote--the highest percentage by a Democrat in Maine since Lyndon B. Johnson carried it as part of his 44-state landslide in 1964, although Bill Clinton in 1996 won with a wider margin when third parties were a factor that year. As evidence of how Democratic Maine has become, George W. Bush at the time was the only Republican to win the White House without carrying Maine. At the same time, however, incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins defeated former Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Allen and won reelection to a third term with 61.33% of the vote. Maine was the only state carried by Obama to elect a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2008. The seat in Maine's 1st Congressional District that was vacated by Tom Allen in his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate was retained by Democrat Chellie Pingree. At the state level, Democrats made gains in the Maine Legislature, picking up six seats in the Maine House of Representatives and one seat in the Maine Senate. ==Results== ===Statewide=== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! colspan=\"7\" | 2008 United States presidential election in Maine |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! style=\"width: 17em\" |Running mate ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes |- ! style=\"background- color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic | Barack Obama | Joe Biden | align=\"right\" | 421,923 | align=\"right\" | 57.71% | align=\"right\" |4 |- ! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican | John McCain | Sarah Palin | align=\"right\" | 295,273 | align=\"right\" | 40.38% | align=\"right\" | 0 |- ! style=\"background- color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent | Ralph Nader | Matt Gonzalez | align=\"right\" | 10,636 | align=\"right\" | 1.45% | align=\"right\" | 0 |- ! style=\"background-color:#0BDA51; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Green | Cynthia McKinney | Rosa Clemente | align=\"right\" | 2,900 | align=\"right\" | 0.40% | align=\"right\" | 0 |- ! style=\"background-color:#FFCC00; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Libertarian | Bob Barr (write-in) | Wayne Allyn Root (write-in) | align=\"right\" | 251 | align=\"right\" | 0.03% | align=\"right\" | 0 |- ! style=\"background-color:#A356DE; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Constitution | Chuck Baldwin (write-in) | Darrell Castle (write-in) | align=\"right\" | 177 | align=\"right\" | 0.02% | align=\"right\" | 0 |- |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | colspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" | Totals | align=\"right\" | 731,163 | align=\"right\" | 100.00% | align=\"right\" | 4 |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | colspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" | Voter turnout | colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" | % | align=\"right\" | \u2014 |} ===Congressional District=== Barack Obama swept both of Maine\u2019s two congressional districts. {|class=wikitable !

Maine is allocated 4 electors because it has 2 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 4 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded just 2 of the electoral votes. The other 2 electoral votes are based upon the congressional district results. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. Since Obama won both congressional districts, all 4 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:Central Maine news, sports & weather & breaking news around Waterville | The Morning Sentinel, Waterville, ME * Robert O'Brien of Portland, ME.
