It adjoins Roque Nublo country park to the north, and Fataga protected area to the east. The park plays an important role in soil protection and the replenishment of an aquifer, along which there are several ravines running southward which are of geomorphological interest and landscape value. The pine forests on hilltops are a well-preserved habitat with abundant bird life. The park also harbours several varieties of cactus and spurge, and a number of aquatic habitats. The park takes its name from natural pools, formerly known locally as pilancones, which remain after the runoff of water. Throughout the area there are threatened animal and plant species, and features of scientific interest.Pilancones Nature Reserve, Turespa\u00f1a / Segittur \u00a9 2014Parque Natural de Pilancones (C-10) , Gobierno de Canarias ==Designations== The space was named as Parque Natural (Natural Park) de Ayagaures y Pilancones in 1987 Law 12/1987, 19 June 1987, Declaration of Natural Spaces of the Canaries and classified in 1994 as parque natural.
