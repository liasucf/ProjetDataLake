Realising that he enjoyed performing comedy, and that it might be profitable, he turned his attention from acting to stand-up. In 2006 and 2008, he participated in Project X Presents events. In 2013 he toured Ireland with his show In the Midst of Crackers.\"Reg D Hunter promises crackin\u2019 show\", Cork Independent, 4 April 2013. Hunter often uses variations of the term \"nigga\" in the titles of his shows; Reginald D Hunter: Pride & Prejudice... & Niggas attracted some controversy, and the poster was banned from the London Underground. His tour with Steve Hughes, called Trophy Nigga, played 55 venues around the UK, but not all the venues used the tour title. Hunter joked that this was because promoters didn't like the word \"trophy\". In April 2013, Hunter performed at an engagement for the Professional Footballers' Association. Following the event, PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle accused Hunter of racism, as he had used the word \"nigger\" during his set. Carlisle also said that some of those present had found Hunter's material \"highly offensive\". In response, Hunter posted to his Facebook page many photos of himself taken after his set with people attending the event, with most smiling. ==Awards== Hunter was nominated for the Perrier Award in the 2002, 2003 and 2004 Edinburgh Festivals.
