The game does not feature a detailed plot or background. Instead the focus is on task completion with the assistance of another un-named and incapacitated robot similar to Blitz. ==Gameplay== The player controls a robot who must navigate through six three part sectors to power up an orbital space cannon. Each sector has a multitude of enemies and a singular physics based puzzle per stage, as well as 'upgradium' pickups that can be used to expand Blitz' utilities, movement, and weaponry. Blitz can jump and interact with machines and elevators. It is able to grab objects likes barrels, carry them and use them to crush enemies as well as use weapons to shoot various enemies. Players can choose a more difficult game mode which when completed, gives access to bonus content. ==Development== RoboBlitz uses a middleware tool developed by Allegorithmic to store its textures procedurally.Procedural Textures: Gaming's Future This technique is used to make the game file size smaller, the actual game is less than 50 megabytes on Xbox Live. ==Reception== RoboBlitz was met with critical acclaim and has received several awards and honors.
