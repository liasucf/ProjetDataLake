The work to repair St John's Church is now completed and Peter Wheatley, Bishop of Edmonton came to rededicate the Church in July 2012. The east end of the nave and chancel, Lady Chapel, vestry and Sunday School room has been restored to their former glory, whilst the west end has been converted to provide new facilities for the Hanlon Centre. In July 2012 as well as the rededication of the church and the opening of St Matthew's School Annex, HRH Prince Andrew came to formally open the new Hanlon Centre and St Matthew's School.
