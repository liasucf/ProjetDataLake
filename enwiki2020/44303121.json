Here he is the ruler of Mag Mell. He is husband to L\u00ed Ban, who woos C\u00fa Chulainn for L\u00ed Ban's sister Fand.James MacKillop, A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), s.v. Labraid Luathl\u00e1m ar Claideb. According to his wife, Labraid was the best of all the warriors in the world.The Yellow Book of Slane \"The Sick-Bed of Cuchulain\" ==Labraid's Home== The following poem is recited by L\u00ed Ban in reference to Labraid's home in Mag Mell: > Labra's home's a pure lake, whither Troops of women come and go; Easy paths > shall lead thee thither, Where thou shalt swift Labra know. Hundreds his > skilled arm repelleth; Wise be they his deeds who speak: Look where rosy > beauty dwelleth; Like to that think Labra's cheek. Head of wolf, for gore > that thirsteth, Near his thin red falchion shakes; Shields that cloak the > chiefs he bursteth, Arms of foolish foes he breaks. Trust of friend he aye > requiteth, Scarred his skin, like bloodshot eye; First of fairy men he > fighteth; Thousands, by him smitten, die. Chiefs at Echaid Juil's name > tremble; Yet his land-strange tale-he sought, He whose locks gold threads > resemble, With whose breath wine-scents are brought. More than all strife- > seekers noted, Fiercely to far lands he rides; Steeds have trampled, skiffs > have floated Near the isle where he abides. Labra, swift Sword-Wielder, > gaineth Fame for actions over sea; Sleep for all his watch sustaineth! Sure > no coward hound is he. The chains on the necks of the coursers he rides, And > their bridles are ruddy with gold: He hath columns of crystal and silver > besides, The roof of his house to uphold.The Yellow Book of Slane \"The Sick- > Bed of Cuchulain\" ==References== Category:Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann Category:Ulster Cycle ",
