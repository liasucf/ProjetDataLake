In 2010, after four seasons in the NCAA, Camper signed with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL).

In February 2014, Camper was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets, and in July 2014, Camper joined the NHL Ottawa Senators organization as a free agent. In July 2015, he signed as a free agent with the Washington Capitals. ==Playing career== As a youth, Camper played in the 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Cleveland. ===College=== Camper played four seasons of Division I NCAA hockey with the Miami RedHawks in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. He finished as the active career scoring leader in the United States. In the 2010\u201311 season, he was third in the US in assists, third in points per game, and fourth in points. In 156 career college games, he had 69 goals and 114 assists for 183 points. He placed second on the school's all-time list for points and career assists, and tied for seventh in career goals. ===Professional=== On April 7, 2011, following his graduation, Camper was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Boston Bruins. He was then immediately assigned to the Bruins top AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, where he made his professional debut the following night in a 5\u20134 win over the Portland Pirates. On February 22, 2012, Camper made his NHL debut with the Bruins against the St. Louis Blues after being recalled from Providence on February 20, 2012. He logged a total of 6:21 time on ice. On February 25, 2012, Camper scored his first career NHL goal against Alex Auld of the Ottawa Senators. It was assisted by Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid. This was also his first NHL point. On February 27, 2012, Camper was sent back down to Providence along with two others as the result of two trades the Bruins made, acquiring three players. On February 7, 2014, Camper was traded by the Bruins to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Blake Parlett and he joined the Springfield Falcons. Camper left the Blue Jackets organization as a free agent on July 2, 2014 when he signed a one-year two-way contract with the Ottawa Senators. On July 1, 2015 he signed a two-year, two- way contract with the Washington Capitals. As a free agent for a second consecutive season, Camper signed a one-year, two-way deal with the New Jersey Devils on July 1, 2016. He spent the duration of the 2016\u201317 season with AHL affiliate, the Albany Devils, compiling 29 assists for 35 points in 47 games. Camper left the Devils as a free agent at the conclusion of his contract, signing a two-year AHL contract with hometown club, the Cleveland Monsters on July 21, 2017. In the 2017\u201318 season, Camper was leading the Monsters in scoring with 29 assists and 42 points in 53 games before he was traded to the Tucson Roadrunners, alongside an NHL transaction between parent affiliate's the Blue Jackets and the Arizona Coyotes on February 26, 2018. Camper found instant success with the Roadrunners, averaging at more than a point-per-game pace to play out the campaign. On June 25, 2018 the Roadrunners traded Camper to the Grand Rapids Griffins in exchange for future considerations. On July 2, 2019, Camper agreed to continue his journeyman AHL career in signing a one- year contract with the Utica Comets, affiliate to the Vancouver Canucks.
