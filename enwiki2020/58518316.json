    "text": "World Skate is the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognised organisational body for roller sports. The organisation is the result of the merger of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS) and the International Skateboarding Federation (ISF) in September 2017, after the ISF's involvement with the scheduled skateboarding events at the Japan 2020 Olympics was rejected. == Disciplines == World Skate serves as the international governing body over: * Skateboarding * Inline speed skating * Artistic skating and inline figure skating ** also governed and organized by the independent and unaffiliated World Inline Figure Skating Association (WIFSA) * Inline Alpine skating, also called inline racing * Inline downhill skating, in partnership with the International Inline Downhill Association (IIDA) * Inline freestyle skating, also called freestyle slalom skating * Inline hockey, also called roller in-line hockey * Rink hockey, also called roller hockey or quad hockey * Roller derby * Roller freestyle, also called aggressive inline skating, street skating, or rolling * Scootering, also called freestyle scootering * Skate cross, also written skatecross ==Competitions== ===World Roller Games=== Since 2017, World Skate has organized the bi-annual World Roller Games, comprising all the world roller sport disciplines as regulated by World Skate. The World Roller Games are a single, multi-sport event that serve as the World Championships of eleven disciplines: alpine, artistic, inline downhill, inline freestyle, inline hockey, rink hockey, roller derby, roller freestyle, scooter, skateboard, and speed. ===Olympic Games=== In 1992, roller hockey was played at the 1992 Summer Olympics as a demonstration sport. Skateboarding events have been introduced for the 2020 Summer Olympics, with two events: park and street. Much like BMX cycling, the park event will feature what resembles an empty swimming pool. Competitors will have three timed runs for tricks. On street, there will be ramps and rails for routines and tricks. There will be a total of 80 total spots, with 20 in each event. Each country can enter a maximum of three athletes in each event. ===World Games=== Roller sports have been represented at the World Games since the first games, held in 1981. Both artistic skating and inline speed skating track have been featured at every holding of the Games, and either roller hockey or inline hockey has been featured at all but the 1997 World Games. The International World Games Association (IWGA) announced on 16 April 2018 that four roller sports would be included in the 30 official sports competing for gold at the 2021 World Games, during 15\u201325 June in Birmingham, Alabama. Birmingham marks the 40th anniversary of the event which will feature 3,600 athletes from more than 100 countries. This the first time the World Games has returned to the United States since 1981. On the programme for the 2021 World Games are four roller sports disciplines; artistic skating, inline hockey, and two speed skating types, road and track. Roller sport is the only sport-type on the World Games programme to be represented in three separate clusters, with speed skating categorized with \"Trend Sports\", artistic skating with \"Artistic Sports,\" and inline hockey with \"Ball Sports\". ===Pan American Games=== In May 2019, the scheduled skateboarding event was removed from the Lima 2019 Pan American Games. Panam Sports announced that skateboarding was removed from the sports program because World Skate could not guarantee that the best possible athletes would be in attendance. World Skate had scheduled a World Tour event which had an overlapping time frame with the Pan American Games. World Skate would also not authorize the competition as an Olympic qualifier. ==Continental Areas== World Skate comprises five continental areas, each involved in organising their own continental competitions: * World Skate Africa * World Skate America * World Skate Asia * World Skate Europe * World Skate Oceania ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:IOC-recognised international federations Category:Roller skating organizations Category:Roller sports Category:Inline skating Category:Artistic roller skating Category:Inline hockey Category:Roller derby Category:Roller hockey Category:Scootering Category:Skateboarding ",
