It is an entertainment channel, primarily dedicated to talk shows, reality series involving lifestyles, and family life. It was originally launched on New Year's Day 2010. On 5 September 2016 at 05:00 CET, the old FEM3 was replaced by PRIME, and a new FEM3 started its test broadcasts on a new frequency. Both channels officially launched at 21:00 CET. Prior to the launch, since 2008, the channel was planned with several names. First, they wanted to bring FEM to Hungary, the name then changed to TV3, as a reincarnation of an entertainment channel which closed down on 21 February 2000. The name was finalized in December 2009. ==Programming== ===Talk Shows=== *FEM3 Caf\u00e9 *Micsoda N\u0151k (V\u00e1rkonyi Andre\u00e1val) *JOSHI, A legjobb bar\u00e1t (Joshi the best friend) ===Imports=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
