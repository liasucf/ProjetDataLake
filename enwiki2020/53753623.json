    "text": "The gens Palfuria was an obscure plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned during the first century of the Empire. The most illustrious of the family was Publius Palfurius, who held the consulship in AD 55.PIR, vol. III, p. 7. ==Origin== The nomen Palfurius Seems to belong to a class of gentilicia formed using various less-common suffixes, such as -urius, perhaps from an earlier form ending in -usius. Other nomina sharing a similar morphology include Furius and Veturius, originally Fusius and Vetusius. ==Branches and cognomina== The only distinct family of the Palfurii bore the cognomen Sura, originally designating someone with prominent calves.Chase, pp. 109, 110. ==Members== * Publius Palfurius, consul suffectus ex Kal.
