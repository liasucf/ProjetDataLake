    "text": "Alpha Comae Berenices (\u03b1 Comae Berenices, abbreviated Alpha Com, \u03b1 Com) is a binary star in the constellation of Coma Berenices (Berenice's Hair), away. It consists of two main sequence stars, each a little hotter and more luminous than the Sun. Alpha Comae Berenices is said to represent the crown worn by Queen Berenice. The two components are designated Alpha Comae Berenices A (officially named Diadem , the traditional name for the system) and B. == Nomenclature == \u03b1 Comae Berenices (Latinised to Alpha Comae Berenices) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Alpha Comae Berenices A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system bore the traditional names Diadem and Al Dafirah, the latter derived from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0641\u064a\u0631\u0629 a\u0111\u0327-\u0111\u0327af\u012brah \"the braid\". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Diadem for the component Alpha Comae Berenices A on 1 February 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Left Wall of Supreme Palace Enclosure, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Comae Berenices, Eta Virginis, Gamma Virginis, Delta Virginis and Epsilon Virginis. \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.

Allen and the meaning is \"a Higher General\".Richard Hinckley Allen: Star Names \u2014 Their Lore and Meaning: Coma Berenices ==Properties== Although Alpha Comae Berenices bears the title \"alpha\", at magnitude 4.32 it is actually fainter than Beta Comae Berenices. It is a binary star, with almost equal components of magnitudes 5.05 m and 5.08 m orbiting each other with a period of 25.87 years. The system, estimated to be 58 light-years distant, appears so nearly \"edge-on\" from the Earth that the two stars appear to move back-and-forth in a straight line with a maximum separation of only 0.7 arcsec. Eclipses are predicted to occur between the two components however they have not been successfully observed due to miscalculations of the time of eclipse. The mean separation between them is approximately 10 AU, about the distance between the Sun and Saturn. The binary star has a visual companion, CCDM J13100+1732C, of apparent magnitude 10.2, located 89 arcseconds away along a position angle of 345\u00b0.Entry 13100+1732, discoverer code STF1728, components AB-C, The Washington Double Star Catalog , United States Naval Observatory.

The apparent diameter of this triangle is a little more than one degree. The location of Alpha Comae Berenicis is westward (preceding) of both globular star clusters. ==References== == External links == Comae Berenices, Alpha Category:Binary stars Category:Coma Berenices (constellation) Category:F-type main-sequence stars Diadem Comae Berenices, 42 114378 064241 Category:Triple stars BD+18 2697 0501 4968 ",
