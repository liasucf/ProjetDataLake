    "text": "Olivia Hallisey is an American scientist at Stanford University. Previously, she attended Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Connecticut. While a junior in high school, she won first prize in the 2015 Google Science Fair for inventing a low-cost, rapid test for Ebola. The prize also came with $50,000. According to Hallisey, her test can be completed in as little as 30 minutes at a cost of $25, and, unlike existing ebola detection methods, does not require refrigeration. She became interested in fighting Ebola while watching the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak in which thousands of people died. ==References== * Heather Won Tesoriero, The Class: A Life-Changing Teacher, His World-Changing Kids, and the Most Inventive Classroom in America (2018) has several chapters on her high school career. excerpt Category:People from Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Living people Category:American women scientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Greenwich High School alumni Category:Stanford University alumni ",
