The papal breve of foundation was dated 5 March 1592, and the seminary was formally opened on 28 May that year, in the buildings of the former H\u00f4pital Saint-Mathieu. In 1605, the seminary opened a dependent college, Li\u00e8ge College, at the University of Leuven. In 1786, after the suppression of the Society of Jesus, the seminary moved into the vacated premises of the Jesuit college. Teaching was suspended during the French period but resumed in 1814, and since 1815 the seminary has been based in the buildings of the former Beaurepart Abbey. The buildings are listed as immovable heritage. While candidates for the priesthood from the diocese of Li\u00e8ge have since 2010 been trained at the Seminary of Namur, the S\u00e9minaire \u00e9piscopal continues to function as a diocesan centre for training and education. In 2014 the diocesan treasurer was charged with misappropriating funds from the seminary. In 2018 he was convicted of embezzling 689,000 euros. ==References== Category:1592 establishments in Europe Category:Buildings and structures in Li\u00e8ge Category:Education in Li\u00e8ge Category:History of Li\u00e8ge Li\u00e8ge Category:Educational institutions established in the 1590s ",
