Mercedes-Benz /8 in which Mohammed was assassinated; note bullet holes in the windshield. Displayed at the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos. Mohammed was assassinated in Lagos, along with his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Akintunde Akinsehinwa, when his car was ambushed in Ikoyi en route to the Dodan Barracks, by a group of soldiers led by Dimka. In a planned broadcast to the nation, Dimka had cited corruption, indecision, arrest and detention without trial, weakness on the part of Mohammed and maladministration in general as the reasons for overthrowing the government. The coup attempt was crushed several hours later by government troops. After a three-week manhunt, Dimka was arrested near Abakaliki in southeastern Nigeria on 6 March 1976. Following a court martial, Dimka and another 6 co-conspirators were executed by firing squad on 15 May 1976. General Mohammed was succeeded by Lieutenant General Olusegun Obasanjo as head of state. ==References== Category:History of Nigeria Category:Military coups in Nigeria Category:1976 in Nigeria Category:February 1976 events in Africa Category:1970s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts Category:Conflicts in 1976 Category:Attempted coups d'\u00e9tat ",
