    "text": "The Building at 1929-1931 Sherman Avenue is a historic apartment building at 1929-1931 Sherman Avenue in Evanston, Illinois. The three-story brick building was built in 1928. The building has an L-shaped layout with a half courtyard, a relatively common layout for Evanston's apartments. Architects Maher and McGrew, who designed several other buildings in Evanston, designed the building in the Tudor Revival style. The building's design features large sections of rough limestone on the basement level, limestone quoins, segmental arched windows, half-timbering, and a series of gables and dormers at the roof line. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 1984. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Apartment buildings in Illinois Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1928 ",
