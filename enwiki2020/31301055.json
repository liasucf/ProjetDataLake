    "text": "Miguel Louren\u00e7o (born 7 February 1920, date of death unknown) was a Portuguese footballer who played as an outside forward. ==Club career== Louren\u00e7o joined S.L. Benfica in 1939, going on to serve as back-up to both Alfredo Valadas and Guilherme Esp\u00edrito Santo during his spell. He made his debut on 22 October 1939 in a 6\u20131 trashing of Carcavelinhos FC for the Campeonato de Lisboa, scoring his team's fourth goal on the 63rd minute. He would only reappear on 4 February 1940, when he took the place of Esp\u00edrito Santo in a match against Leix\u00f5es S.C. for the Primeira Divis\u00e3o; despite failing to win the league, he helped the club conquer the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal and the Lisbon Championship, netting ten times in the process. For the following season, 20-year old Louren\u00e7o played the majority of its games in the Portuguese Cup, featuring in just 12 matches and scoring six goals as Benfica failed to win any silverware. In 1941\u201342, his playing time was further reduced as he amassed just three scoreless appearances in the Lisbon Championship. Louren\u00e7o left Benfica in 1942, signing for neighbouring club G.D. Estoril Praia two years later. He remained there until his retirement at the age of 33, eventually reaching the Portugal national team. ==Honours== ;Benfica *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1939\u201340 *Campeonato de Lisboa: 1939\u201340 ==References== General * Specific ==External links== * *Portugal stats at Eu-Football *Worldfootball profile Category:1920 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
