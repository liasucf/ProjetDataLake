He was also a member, and served on the board of governors, of the Tuxedo Park Club. ==Personal life== In 1940, Mortimer was married to Barbara \"Babe\" Cushing (1915\u20131978) at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Hampton, New York. Babe was the daughter of Dr. Harvey Cushing. Together, with her older sisters, she was part of the \"fabulous Cushing sisters.\" Her sister Minnie Cushing was the second wife of Vincent Astor, and another sister, Betsey Cushing married James Roosevelt (the son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and later John Hay Whitney. Before their divorce in 1946, Babe and Stanley were the parents of two children: * Stanley Grafton Mortimer III (b. 1942), a Harvard graduate who married Siri Aagot Larsen in 1971. * Amanda Jay Mortimer (b. 1944), who married Carter Burden Jr., a Vanderbilt descendant, in 1964. They divorced in 1972 and she married Steven Ross (1927\u20131992), the CEO of Time Warner, in 1979. In 1981, they also divorced. After their divorce, Babe married William S. Paley, the longtime leader of CBS. In 1947, Mortimer remarried to Kathleen Lanier Harriman (1917\u20132011), the daughter of W.
