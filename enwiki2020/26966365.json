    "text": "Archie Brain (born 1942) is a British anaesthetist best known as the inventor of the laryngeal mask. The LMA has been used over 300 million times worldwide in elective anaesthesia and emergency airway management. ==Biography== Brain returned to the UK in April 1980 and took up a post as a lecturer at the Royal London Hospital under Professor Jimmy Payne. He set out to determine the electromagnetic field strength required to block the action potential along a nerve. This involved encircling a frog nerve-muscle preparation with an electromagnetic coil.Wali FA, Brain AIJ. Inhibition of nerve conduction by electromagnetic induction of the frog sciatic nerve \u2013 gastrocnemius muscle preparation. Jap J Physiol 1989;39:303\u2013310. In 1982, he had his first publication: a letter to the editor suggesting that alcuronium should be used instead of succinylcholine for \"crash\" induction.Brain AI. The rapid induction tecnique for Caesarean section. Anaesthesia 1982;37:345. Brain submitted patent applications for 12 new devices, including one to assist venepuncture, one to prevent obstruction of anaesthetic trolleys by cables, one to apply a specific amount of cricoid pressure, and even a rotating bed for use in intensive care to prevent bed-sores. The laryngeal mask, LMA Classic was his 13th patent application and was granted in 1982.Joseph R. Brimacombe, Laryngeal Mask Airway: Principles and Practice, Second Edition (2005), pp. 10\u201311. The LMA Classic was sold by LMA International NV, a company sold to Teleflex Inc in 2012 for $276m. ==References== ==Further reading== *Joseph R.
