    "text": "The Kalgoorlie was a train service operated by the Western Australian Government Railways between November 1962 and November 1971. ==Railway== Following the opening of the Eastern Goldfields Railway to Kalgoorlie in December 1887, a service from Perth commenced. Although not officially named, it was often referred to as the Great Eastern Express, Kalgoorlie Express or Kalgoorlie Passenger. Following the opening of the Trans-Australian Railway in October 1917, its importance increased with the commencement of the Trans- Australian Express from Port Augusta in South Australia. By May 1921, a separate overnight express (later named The Westland) for interstate passengers and mail was introduced and it became the connecting train with the Trans-Australian Express. The existing service remained to service intrastate passengers and was named The Kalgoorlie on 3 December 1962. Following the conversion of the Eastern and Eastern Goldfields lines to standard gauge, The Kalgoorlie was scheduled to be replaced by The Prospector. However delays in delivery of new rolling stock saw the existing narrow gauge service continue. As it was the only narrow gauge train traversing the Northam to Merredin section of the Eastern line, it was diverted via Wyalkatchem in October 1970 to allow the old line to close. The Kalgoorlie last ran on 28 November 1971. ==References== ==External links== ==See also== *The Westland Category:Kalgoorlie-Boulder Category:Named passenger trains of Western Australia Category:Railway services introduced in 1962 Category:Railway services discontinued in 1971 Category:1962 establishments in Australia Category:1971 disestablishments in Australia Category:Discontinued railway services in Australia ",
