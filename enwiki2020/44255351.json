    "text": "Erik Nascimento Lima (born 18 July 1994), simply known as Erik, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Japanese club Yokohama F. Marinos, on loan from Palmeiras, as a forward. He began his career at Goi\u00e1s in 2013, scoring 36 goals in 103 matches across all competitions and winning the Best Newcomer Award in the 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A. In 2015, he transferred to Palmeiras for \u20ac3 million. ==Club career== ===Goi\u00e1s=== Born in Novo Repartimento, Par\u00e1, Erik joined Goi\u00e1s's youth setup in 2004, aged 10, after impressing on a trial when visiting family in Goi\u00e2nia. In February 2013, after impressing with the under-20s in Copa S\u00e3o Paulo de Futebol J\u00fanior, he was promoted to the main squad. On 7 March 2013 Erik renewed his link with the Esmeraldino, signing until December 2016. He made his senior debut on the 27th, coming on as a second-half substitute for David in a 2\u20130 home win against CRAC for the Campeonato Goiano championship; he appeared in only one further match in the competition, as his side finished second. On 7 July 2013 Erik made his S\u00e9rie A debut, starting in a 1\u20130 home win against Vit\u00f3ria. He only appeared rarely during the campaign, with his side finishing in an unexpected sixth position. Erik scored his first goal as a senior on 26 February 2014, netting the first in a 2\u20131 home win against An\u00e1polis. He subsequently overtook veteran Ara\u00fajo and Rychely during the year. Erik started the first league game of the campaign, a 1\u20130 away win against Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro on 4 May. He scored his first goal in the competition on the 23rd, netting the last in a 2\u20132 home draw against Santos, and subsequently was an ever-present figure for the club, scoring a hat-trick against Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense on 31 August, and also adding braces against Bahia and Chapecoense. After finishing the campaign with 12 goals, he was named Best Newcomer. After being strongly linked to a move, Erik remained with Goi\u00e1s for 2015. In the year's Goiano he scored two braces, against Atl\u00e9tico Goianiense and Gr\u00eamio An\u00e1polis, as his team won the state title. In the year's national tournament, Erik recorded 10 goals from 26 games, including two-goal hauls in 3\u20130 wins over S\u00e3o Paulo, Vasco da Gama and Joinville in the middle of the campaign; the latter two teams were relegated alongside Goi\u00e1s. ===Palmeiras=== Amid interest from Turkey's Fenerbah\u00e7e, Erik signed a five-year contract for Palmeiras on 23 December 2015; the Verd\u00e3o purchased 60% of his economic rights for a fee of \u20ac3 million. He made his debut on 19 January in the first match of the new Campeonato Paulista season, replacing Gabriel Jesus for the final 16 minutes of a 2\u20130 win at Botafogo (SP). Regularly a substitute, he did not score in his first campaign. His national league debut came on 29 May, again in place of Gabriel Jesus in a 1\u20130 loss at city rivals S\u00e3o Paulo. In his next game, a start on 4 July, he scored his first Palmeiras goal in his 14th game, opening a 3\u20131 win at Sport Recife. On 14 December 2017, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro announced the acquisition of Erik on a year-long loan deal for the 2018 season. However, after a string of poor performances, he was demoted to the reserve team. Subsequently, he left the side and joined Botafogo on loan on 17 August for the remainder of the season. On 26 July 2019 Erik moved abroad for the first time when he joined Yokohama F. Marinos of Japan's J1 League on an 18-month loan. ==International career== On 8 May 2013 Erik was called up to Brazil under-20 team, for the year's Toulon Tournament. A backup to Giovanni and Vin\u00edcius Ara\u00fajo, he only appeared against Nigeria on 4 June, scoring the first in a 1\u20131 draw; his side was eventually crowned champions shortly after. On 6 March 2015 Erik was called up to the under-23s, making his debut in a 4\u20131 home routing over Paraguay on 27 March. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|State League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Goi\u00e1s |2013 |rowspan=\"3\"|S\u00e9rie A |4||0||2||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||0 |- |2014 |34||12||8||2||1||0||4Appearance(s) in Copa Sudamericana||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||47||17 |- |2015 |26||10||16||6||5||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||48||19 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !64!!22!!26!!8!!8!!3!!5!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!103!!36 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Palmeiras |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A |16||3||10||0||2||0||2Appearance(s) in Copa Libertadores||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||3 |- |2017 |9||0||4||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !25!!3!!14!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!44!!3 |- |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro (loan) |2018 |S\u00e9rie A |5||0||12||0||6||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||2 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Botafogo (loan) |2018 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A |17||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||5 |- |2019 |3||1||10||1||4||3||2||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||8 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !20!!6!!10!!1!!4!!3!!2!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!36!!13 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !114!!31!!62!!9!!21!!8!!11!!6!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!208!!54 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Palmeiras * Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 2016 ;Yokohama F.
