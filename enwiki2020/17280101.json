    "text": "This list of Berenstain Bears books includes many in the picture book series (such as \"Beginner Books\" and \"First Time Books\") and the illustrated children's novels, such as those in the \"Big Chapter Books\" series. Since the first Berenstain Bears installment was published in 1962, the series has sold close to 260 million copies. In addition to writing children's literature, the authors Stan and Jan Berenstain also wrote two parenting books, What Your Parents Never Told You About Being a Mom or Dad (1995) and The Berenstain Bears and the Bear Essentials (2005), as well as their autobiography, Down a Sunny Dirt Road (2002). The Berenstain Bears appear in each of these books. ==Publication summary== Titles marked with an asterisk (*) were adapted into episodes of the 1985 cartoon series. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:0em;\" !
