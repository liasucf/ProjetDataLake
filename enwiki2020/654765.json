I hung out with John McCook the whole time and I kept watching all these people from other countries asking for his autograph. I'm thinking to myself, 'Who the hell is this guy?' So one night, we were drinking Coronas and I asked him why he had so many fans and he explained how B&B; was so popular around the world. I had no idea. The more he talked about it, the more I was thinking, 'I want to be on that show.'... The first time I drove into the parking lot, there was John, just pointing at me and laughing. He asked what I was doing here and I told him that I was Thorne. That's when he told me that he was going to be playing my dad. That was just too wild.\"Soap Opera Digest Insider, September 6, 2007 Before acting, Harmon was employed as a model with Ford Models.\"Winsor Harmon: A Model Life.\" Soap Opera Digest 8 Mar. 2007.
