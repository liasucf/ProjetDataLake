The 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship is a motor racing championship for Formula 2 cars that is sanctioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship is the fifty-fourth season of Formula 2 racing and the fourth season run under the FIA Formula 2 Championship moniker.

The category is scheduled to be run in support of selected rounds of the 2020 FIA Formula One World Championship. As the championship is a spec series, all teams and drivers competing in the championship will run the same car, the Dallara F2 2018. Nyck de Vries is the 2019 drivers' champion, having won the title at the penultimate round of the 2019 championship in Russia. DAMS are the reigning teams' champions, having secured their first Formula 2 title in Abu Dhabi. 2020 was due to be the final season of Dallara F2 2018 chassis package which debuted in 2018 season with a new chassis originally scheduled for 2021. This was delayed for another three seasons, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Entries== The following teams and drivers are under contract to compete in the 2020 championship. As the championship is a spec series, all competitors race with an identical Dallara F2 2018 chassis with a V6 turbo engine developed by Mecachrome. Teams compete with tyres supplied by Pirelli. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%\" ! Entrant ! ! Driver name !

As a result, Gelael will be forced to miss Spa and other three rounds, leaving his DAMS seat vacant. On 22 August 2020 it was announced that DAMS would hire Red Bull Junior driver J\u00fcri Vips as an interim driver. Matsushita left the MP Motorsport team after the Mugello round, and Alesi moved across from HWA to replace him with immediate effect.

It was replaced by a round at the Circuit Zandvoort, running in support of the revived Dutch Grand Prix. The Bahrain and Barcelona rounds were postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Zandvoort, Monaco and Baku rounds were cancelled alongside the Dutch, Monaco and Azerbaijan Grands Prix. A revised calendar was published in June 2020, featuring two rounds at the Red Bull Ring and two at the Silverstone Circuit. On 10 July 2020, Mugello was added as the ninth round of the season. It was the first time for this circuit to be featured in the schedule of the main Formula One feeder series since the 1997 International Formula 3000 Championship.https://www.fiaformula2.com/Latest/2k0dVVCDXZjSg5vIUVQee0/fia- formula-2-and-fia-formula-3-add-mugello-to-2020-season-calendar On 29 July 2020, Sochi was added to the calendar as the tenth round of the season.https://www.fiaformula2.com/Latest/7HysGz7vksoAN23hWOvG1p/sochi-added- to-the-fia-formula-2-2020-revised-calendar The championship is scheduled to use the Outer Circuit layout for the season finale at Bahrain. ==Regulation changes== ===Technical changes=== The series switched from conventional 13-inch wheel rims to larger 18-inch wheel rims to allow Formula One tyre supplier Pirelli to gather data on how the larger tyres would work ahead of Formula One's adoption of 18-inch wheels in 2022. In addition the Pirelli FIA Formula 2 Championship tyre sizes were also slightly altered with the front tyre width increased from while the rear tyre width remained same at . The overall tyre diameter (front and rear) sizes were increased from as a result of 18-inch wheel rim introduction. The conventional 13-inch wheel rims that had been used since 2005 were retired. ==Season report== Guanyu Zhou started the season opener at the Red Bull Ring from pole position but suffered technical issues whilst leading the race, allowing his UNI-Virtuosi Racing teammate Callum Ilott to take his first Formula 2 victory. The sprint race was won by MP Motorsport driver Felipe Drugovich on his debut Formula 2 weekend. Yuki Tsunoda took pole position for the second feature race in Austria, but made a late pit stop due to miscommunication with his Carlin team, losing track position. He recovered to second place but was unable to overtake Prema Racing's Robert Shwartzman, who took his first Formula 2 victory and the championship lead. Tsunoda and Shwartzman both retired from the sprint race, Tsunoda with a suspected clutch issue and Shwartzman after spinning on the opening lap. ART Grand Prix driver Christian Lundgaard overtook reverse-grid pole sitter Dan Ticktum to claim his first Formula 2 victory. Ilott scored pole position in the wet qualifying at the Hungaroring. But he was not able to convert pole to race win due to less effective tire strategy. Shwartzman, who passed five drivers on start, took the race victory, after the eleventh place on the grid. Ilott started the reverse-grid race from pole and finished second. This time Luca Ghiotto was the fastest driver to choose different strategy which lead him to the sixth win in Formula 2. Felipe Drugovich brought first F2 pole to MP Motorsport in the first round at Silverstone. But his decision to start on the harder compound of tires lead to his losing of the three positions during the first lap. Nikita Mazepin took his first win, while Hitech Grand Prix became the first team to win with both drivers. Ticktum led the whole sprint race which he started from the reverse-grid pole to achieve his first victory. Ilott returned to the pole position for the second Silverstone round feature race. Ilott reclaimed the championship lead from Shwartzman after he won the race. Tsunoda scored his first race win after collision between Mick Schumacher and Shwartzman, who was ahead of him, in the sprint race. Ilott continued to score poles, outpacing Shwartzman in the Barcelona Qualifying. Nobuharu Matsushita was the only driver who had a pit- stop during the safety car period after Sean Gelael and Giuliano Alesi tangled. It helped Matsushita to achieve win after start from the 18th on the grid, which as 2020 Barcelona Formula 2 round is the farthest starting position to take a race win in the history of FIA Formula 2 Championship. Tsunoda returned to the pole position of the feature race at Spa. Mazepin crossed the finish line first in the race but he was handed a five-seconds time penalty for forcing Tsunoda off the track multiple times. Shwartzman benefited from his good start and collision between Ticktum and Roy Nissany, reclaiming the championship lead from Ilott with the sprint race win. Ilott repeated his previous year success in Monza qualifying, grabbing another pole. But pit stop struggles left him without of chance of podium. The race was won by Schumacher, who was victorious in the feature race for the first time. He was accompanied by Ghiotto and Lundgaard on podium. In the feature race Ticktum crossed the finish line first, but he was disqualified due to a lack of fuel. Ilott inherited the win and retook the lead in the championship from Shwartzman. Lundgaard achieved his first pole position in the Mugello qualifying, but he was not successful in the race. For the first time since 2018 Sakhir Formula 2 round the team scored their one-two with Mazepin first and Ghiotto second. Both Ilott and Shwartzman have not scored points in the feature race, while Schumacher who finished fifth became a championship leader for the first time. The sprint race was won by Lundgaard ahead of Louis Del\u00e9traz, J\u00fcri Vips and Schumacher. This was Vips' first podium in formula two. Finishing ahead of his closest rivals, Ilott and Shwartzman, Schumacher extended his championship lead. In Sochi Tsunoda started the feature race from pole position. He held on to the lead from the start ahead of Schumacher and Jehan Daruvala. During the round of pitstops Daruvala lost third place to Ilott. A few laps later, just as the cars who started the race on the harder compound of tyres, Schumacher passed Tsunoda for the lead. Ilott later passed him as well but the Japanese recovered second place from him in the closing stages of the race, while Ilott only narrowly fended off Luca Ghiotto for third place. Meanwhile Schumacher won his second feature race of the season. In the sprint race Zhou started from pole position. He held on to the lead ahead of Jack Aitken. Aitken would be later passed by Mazepin and Schumacher. During lap 7 Aitken and Ghiotti made contact while battling for fourth place and crashed into the barriers heavily. The race was suspended because of the incident and ultimately could not be resumed due the barriers not being able to be repaired in time. This allowed Zhou to secure his first win, with Mazepin and Schumacher completing the podium. Because of the early suspension only half points were awarded. Schumacher extended his championship lead by virtue of his two podiums. ==Results and standings== ===Season summary=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" !colspan=2| Round !
