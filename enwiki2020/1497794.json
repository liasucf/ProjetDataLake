Retrieved 2010-11-04 By August 1977, RAS had started regional services from Sainte-Marie to Mayotte with a 32-seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop. RAS became Air R\u00e9union in December 1986. In October 1990, Sematra, a company 46% owned by the local councils of R\u00e9union with the remaining shares owned by banks and other private partners, purchased Air R\u00e9union. === 1990\u20132011: Development as Air Austral and growth in operations === In November 1990, Air R\u00e9union became Air Austral. Two months later, Air Austral bought its first Boeing 737-500. Another 737-300 was acquired in 1994, and in 1997, the airline purchased a 737-300QC, which enabled both passenger and cargo only traffic. In 2000, the airline took delivery of an ATR 72-500, a short-haul turboprop. By then, Air Austral operated from both Roland Garros Airport in Sainte-Marie and Pierrefonds Airport in Saint Pierre with scheduled services to Mayotte, South Africa (Johannesburg), Comoros, Mauritius, the Seychelles, and four destinations in Madagascar (Antananarivo, Tamatave, Nosy Be, Majunga). In 2003, Air Austral launched its first long-haul service between R\u00e9union and Paris, with two Boeing 777-200ERs. The two Boeing 777s were joined by a third Boeing 777-200ER in 2005. A second long-haul route from R\u00e9union to Marseille and Lyon was established. In 2007, a third long-haul service to Toulouse via Marseille started. In 2008, the airline introduced new uniforms for staff and crew members, designed by Balenciaga. The second ATR 72-500 was added to the fleet, followed by a third a few months later. In April 2009, Air Austral started a new service to Sydney and New Caledonia, thus opening up a new route between Paris and Sydney via R\u00e9union. The airline also acquired two Boeing 777-300ERs. In November, it placed a firm order for two all-economy class 840-seat Airbus A380s, for delivery in 2014. These are intended for Air Austral's R\u00e9union-Paris flights.\"Air Austral signs firm order for two single class A380s\" , Airbus press release 17 November 2009. Retrieved 2010-11-04 In June 2010, it was announced that Air Austral would start scheduled flights from R\u00e9union to Bordeaux and Nantes from February 2011. In August 2011, Air Austral received its first Boeing 777-200LR. === 2012\u2013present: Economic struggles and subsequent rebound === In April 2012, founder and chief executive G\u00e9rard Eth\u00e8ve was replaced by Marie-Joseph Mal\u00e9 following financial difficulties caused by risky business decisions made worse by high fuel prices.Eth\u00e8ve's management style and difficult relations with unions was also in question and played a role in the decision. Non-profitable routes to Noum\u00e9a, Sydney, Marseille, Bordeaux, Nantes, Toulouse, and Lyon were closed. Additionally, Air Austral was unable to pay for a new 777-200LR awaiting delivery and looked to sell the plane instead of taking delivery of it. Following this development, Air Austral announced in May 2012 that it would defer or cancel its order for 2 Airbus A380s, with a decision to be made by the end of June 2012.\"European woes force changes for the better at Indian Ocean carriers, with Air Austral the latest\", CAPA article, 24 May 2012. Retrieved 2012-05-29 In June 2013, Air Austral introduced direct flights to Chennai, India with its new Boeing 737-800s.Around 120,000 (1.2 lakh) persons of Tamil origin are reported to live in Reunion. Air Austral links to Chennai In February 2015, the company announced an order for two Boeing 787-8s, to be delivered in May and October 2016 respectively. In March 2015, it also announced the lease of 2 more B777-300ER from Air Lease Corporation (ALC). These aircraft, delivered in late 2016, replaced the oldest two models of the same type then operated by Air Austral. In November 2015, the company sold its single Boeing 777-200LR to Florida-based broker Atlas Aviation, which became the \"Crystal Skye\" ultraluxury air cruise aircraft. Air Austral simultaneously announced the lease, from November 2015 to May 2016 of a Boeing 737-300QC (QC for quick change) from ASL Airlines France (formerly Europe Airpost). The plane involved was F-ODZZ, a convertible version of the 737-300 (the cabin configuration can be changed from passengers to freight) that had actually already been in Air Austral service between 1997 and 2005. It was used until the first of the two Boeing 787-8s ordered by the company was delivered in May 2016. In October 2017, Air Austral signed a strategic partnership agreement with Air Madagascar to become the airline's minority shareholder, owning a 49% stake in the company, after the two companies established their relationship in 2016. The move was done in part to help Air Madagascar return to profitability and facilitate stronger connections within the regional market for the two airlines. In February 2018, Air Austral revealed its restructuring strategy for Air Madagascar through 2027, which included stabilising the company's finances, launching strategic routes, and expanding the company's fleet. In July 2018, Kenya Airways signed a memorandum of understanding to join the partnership in an effort to strengthen Nairobi's connections to R\u00e9union and Madagascar and to also open up the possibilities of codesharing between the three carriers. The agreement was later finalized by the three airlines in December 2018. However, in November 2019, reports revealed that the partnership between Air Austral and Air Madagascar was at risk of dissolution after Air Austral did not contribute its second payment of \u20ac25 million for its equity share in the airline. In August 2018, Air Austral began wet leasing an Airbus A380 from charter airline Hi Fly after it grounded one of its Boeing 787s due to inspections of the plane's Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. In October 2019, Air Austral announced it was developing its plans to renew its fleet. That month, the airline signed a purchase agreement for three Airbus A220-300 aircraft that would replace its two Boeing 737-800 and ATR 72-500 jets. The three Airbus A220s are scheduled to be delivered between November 2020 and 1Q 2021. The airline projects it may begin renewing its long-haul fleet beginning in 2023. ==Destinations== This is a list of destinations served by Air Austral as of May 2017: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |Country or territory ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |City ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |IATA ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |ICAO ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |Airport ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |Notes ! style=\"background:#ce2029; color:white;\" |Refs |- |||Moroni||align=center|HAH||align=center|FMCH||Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Dzaoudzi||align=center|DZA||align=center|FMCZ||Dzaoudzi Pamandzi International Airport||||align=center| |- |||Marseille||align=center|MRS||align=center|LFML||Marseille Provence Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Paris||align=center|CDG||align=center|LFPG||Charles de Gaulle Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Saint Denis||align=center|RUN||align=center|FMEE||Roland Garros Airport||||align=center| |- |||Saint- Pierre||align=center|ZSE||align=center|FMEP||Pierrefonds Airport||||align=center| |- |||Chennai||align=center|MAA||align=center|VOMM||Chennai International Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Antananarivo||align=center|TNR||align=center|FMMI||Ivato Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Nosy Be||align=center|NOS||align=center|FMNN||Fascene Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Toamasina||align=center|TMM||align=center|FMMT||Toamasina Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Port Louis||align=center|MRU||align=center|FIMP||Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Mah\u00e9||align=center|SEZ||align=center|FSIA||Seychelles International Airport||align=center| ||align=center| |- |||Johannesburg||align=center|JNB||align=center|FAOR||O.
