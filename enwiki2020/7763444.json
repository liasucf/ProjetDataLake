From 1977 until 1992 he served as the Director of the British Museum, where he had previously worked, from 1955 to 1964, as an assistant keeper. In his role as director he was implicated in the international controversy concerning looting related to the British Museum, indirectly playing a major role in the growing movement for the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles to Athens. ==Education== Wilson was born on 30 October 1931 in Dacre Banks, near Harrogate, England. He was the son of Joseph, a minister, and Nora, a lecturer. From 1941 to 1950, Wilson was educated at Kingswood School, a boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational) in Bath, followed by St John's College at the University of Cambridge, from where he obtained a Master of Arts. In 1955 he obtained a graduate degree from the Lund University in Sweden. ==Life and career== Danes depicted invading England From 1977 to 1992 Wilson served as the Director of the British Museum, where he was the seventeenth person to hold that distinction since its 1753 founding. He had previously worked there from 1955 to 1964 as an assistant keeper, after which he worked at the University of London. There he was Reader from 1964 to 1971, and a professor of medieval archaeology from 1971 to 1976; from 1973 he was also the joint head of the department of Scandinavian studies at University College London. During his time as Director, from 1985 to 1986 Wilson was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge. He was a member of the Ancient Monuments Board for England from 1976 to 1984, the Nottingham University Council from 1988 to 1984, and the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission from 1990 to 1998. From 1976 to 1981 he was a member of the board of governors for the Museum of London; he was also a trustee, of the National Museums of Scotland from 1985 to 1987, and of the National Museums of Merseyside from 1986 to 2001.

In 1960 he published The Anglo-Saxons,This book was first published by Thames & Hudson in their \"Ancient Peoples and Places\" series (Snippet view from Google Books).

This was widely seen as a public relations disaster for the British Museum. The Parthenon Marbles had been taken down from the Parthenon by agents of Lord Elgin in the early 19th century when Greece was under Ottoman rule. The television showdown was a defining moment for the campaign for restitution of the marbles to Athens, which now has wide international support from organisations such as UNESCO as well as support from the majority of the British public. ===Awards and honours=== Wilson has received many awards and honours throughout his professional life.
