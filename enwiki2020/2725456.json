    "text": "Into the Fire was the second single from Sarah McLachlan's album Solace. It was written by McLachlan and her producer Pierre Marchand. ==Music video== The music video was one of the rare instances to portray full nudity: the first half showed McLachlan lying in a wooded field, completely naked and covered from head to toe in mud, before walking underneath a waterfall, washing the mud off, and proceeding to sing by it dry and fully clothed in the second half. Interspersed throughout were shots of a young girl running through the woods in slow-motion. == Track listing == === 7\": Arista / 115 266 (Germany, UK) === # \"Into the Fire (Album version)\" # \"Into the Fire (John Fryer Mix)\" === CD: Nettwerk / W2-3063 (Canada) === # \"Into the Fire\" # \"Sad Clown (CBC version)\" # \"Black (CBC version)\" * Also released on cassette 4JW-3063 === CD: Arista / ASCD-2390 (US) === # \"Into the Fire (John Fryer Mix)\" (3:32) # \"Into the Fire (Album Version)\" (3:29) * US promo release === 12\": ADP-2402 (US) === # \"Into the Fire (extended remix)\" # \"Into the Fire (dub)\" # \"Into the Fire (John Fryer mix)\" * US promo release === CD: Arista / ASCD-2402 (US) === # \"Into the Fire (extended remix)\" # \"Into the Fire (dub)\" # \"Into the Fire (John Fryer mix)\" # \"Into the Fire (Album version)\" * US promo release ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1991\u201392) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1991 songs Category:1992 singles Category:Sarah McLachlan songs Category:Arista Records singles Category:Nettwerk Records singles Category:Songs written by Sarah McLachlan Category:Songs written by Pierre Marchand Category:Juno Award for Video of the Year videos ",
