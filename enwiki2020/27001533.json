Sherds: The latest novel of National Artist for Literature Francisco Sionil Jos\u00e9 , Fragments of Truth, Book Review, Life & Times, The Manila Times, January 9, 2009, archives.manilatimes.net and multi-awardedCommencement Speaker - Francisco Sionil Jose, Foundation Time Community Page, negroschronicle.com author F. Sionil Jos\u00e9. According to Elmer A. Ordo\u00f1ez, a writer from The Manila Times, in Sherds Jos\u00e9 achieved \u201clyrical effects\u201d, specially in the novel\u2019s final chapters, by putting into \u201cgood use\u201d Joseph Conrad\u2019s and Ford Madox Ford\u2019s so-called progression d\u2019effet (literally \"progression of the effect\"). Sherds is the latest and last novel by Jos\u00e9. According to The Atlantic National Correspondent James Fallows, the novel is dedicated to the author\u2019s wife Teresita Jos\u00e9.Fallows, James. Frankie Jos\u00e9, The Atlantic, March 5, 2009, theatlantic.com The novel, which can be read in one sitting, was described by Li-an de la Cruz-Busto, a reporter for Sun.Star Davao as \u201cvery light but candid and insightful\u201d,De la Cruz-Busto, Li-an.Busto: Instant fan, Choices, Sun.Star Davao, January 17, 2009, sunstar.com.ph a description that complements The Manila Times reporter Perry Gil S. Mallari\u2019s calling Jos\u00e9\u2019s Sherds as an \u201ceasy read and a guaranteed page-turner\u201d. A novel composed of twelve chapters with a \"tight and palpable\" narrative pacing, Sherds deals with topics related to \"personal conscience, greed and the position of art\" in social class struggle, thus serving as a cogitation on \"what is wrong\" with the Philippines as a nation. Jos\u00e9 wrote Sherds while he was in Japan. ==Description== Like Jos\u00e9\u2019s other novels and stories such as the Rosales Saga, Sherds is another presentation and \u201cmeditation\u201d by the author regarding \u201cclass conflict\u201d and \u201cmalaise in society\u201d in the Philippines through the use of \u201cnon-ideological terms\u201d and sharing of his personal knowledge of the \u201ctravails of the original tillers of the soil\u201d and the dispossession of the land-tillers through the workings of the oligarchs. Employing a story- telling technique that begins with the \u201cending of the story, in medias res\u201d, Jos\u00e9 narrates the tale of the discovery made by Peter Gregory Golangco (also known simply as PG Golangco), a pottery-and-ceramics artist, art professor, and aesthete, through the \u201cPygmalion-like nurturing\u201d of Guia Espiritu, Golangco\u2019s student who has an elemental idea of art that is \u201cgrounded in the clay of oppressed people\u201d of the Philippine countryside.Ordo\u00f1ez, Elmer A. The Education of an Aesthete, The Other View, Opinion, The Manila Times (2001) January 19, 2008, manilatimes.net As an \u201cart and society\u201d novel, the ninth chapter of Sherds showed Golangco as an aesthete questioned about his pose and position regarding social protest and his views about Pablo Picasso and Francisco Goya during an art exhibit. Golangco is a believer that \u201cart thrives on freedom\u201d. However, a guest during the exhibition countered Golangco\u2019s belief by saying that freedom is a \u201cpolitical condition\u201d and that Golangco is a free person because of influence and the financial means to buy freedom, which is contrary to the so-called unpampered and unfree \u201cartists of the people\u201d. Despite such \"questioning\", Golangco was applauded. Surprised, Golangco retreated to Caf\u00e9 Guernica, where he became \u201calmost inconsolable\u201d until Golangco was reassured by two female companions. According to Elmer A. Ordo\u00f1ez, this scene in Sherds, is where Golangco\u2019s \u201ceducation of the aesthete\u201d started. The novel is full of symbolism. The primary example of such usage of symbolism is the clay used by PG Golangco in making pots. The clay symbolizes the oppressed villagers in Espiritu's barrio. As a symbolic element of the narrative, the clay has a fundamental function at the finale of the novel. ==Principal characters== The major protagonists of the novel are Peter Gregory Golangco and Guia Espiritu. Golangco, a recognized art scholar abroad and a member of a hacienda-owning clan, was a student, artist, academic, and occasional \u201csybaritic delights\u201d indulger who decided to return to the Philippines. Golangco was oblivious to the fact that the Golangcos who stayed in the Philippines were the source of oppression, death, and poverty in the village in his hometown. The Golangco clan has a thriving business enterprise inside and outside the Philippines. The clan also participated in Philippine politics through elections and accepting appointments to positions at the \u201chigher echelons\u201d of the Philippine Government. PG Golangco had a \u201clong- standing affair\u201d with the dean of the university where he is teaching. The dean was a former student of Golangco. PG Golangco was unaware that the Golangcos were responsible for the demise of the parents of Guia Espiritu, Golangco's student. Guia Espiritu is Golangco\u2019s student-assistant and \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9 in grooming\u201d. Espiritu described the Philippines as a country and society that remained semi-feudal and semi-colonial. Despite being the art student, Espiritu became Golangco\u2019s \u201ceducator of the aesthete\u201d. Espiritu introduced and mentored Golangco about the clay and pottery practices of her parents and in her village. Such introduction and mentoring lead Golangco to the \u201caesthetics and pedagogy\u201d of the oppressed and the dispossessed, and eventually to Golangco\u2019s discovery of Espiritu\u2019s origins. Golangco became intrigued by of the \u201cstrange happenings in his own household and dealings\u201d with Espiritu. ==References== Category:Political novels Category:2007 novels Category:Novels by F.
