    "text": "Santana is an American rock band, formed in 1966 by the Mexican American guitarist Carlos Santana, which has performed for five decades. The group's first concert tours were North America, with performances in Europe, where they performed at small and medium-size venues and rock festivals. Following a lineup change in early 1972, they toured the world from 1972 to 1973. During this tour, the band performed at arenas and theaters, while doing several concerts in South America, one of the first tours of the continent by a major American rock act. After a North American tour in 1974, the last remaining members of the group from their famous lineup, Michael Shrieve and Jos\u00e9 Areas, quit the group, and the band underwent multiple lineup changes during the following years. In the 1970s to the 1980s, the band played at arenas, but mostly theaters and seldom music festivals. In the 1990s, the group lost their recording contract, but they continued to tour extensively throughout the decade, mostly playing at theaters and amphitheaters. However, the band ended the decade with the Supernatural Tour, a vehicle for their popular 1999 album Supernatural. The 177\u2013date tour was a success with audiences and critics, and the group continued to perform within the 2000s. In the third quarter of 2010, Carlos Santana proposed to drummer Cindy Blackman after her solo on the song \"Coraz\u00f3n Espinado\", and she became an official member of the band in 2016. The group continues to tour the world to this day. == 1967-68 performances (1967\u20131968) == Santana, then known as the Santana Blues Band, performed in 1967 and 1968 in many line-ups throughout the West Coast of the United States. === History === In January 1967, Carlos Santana was offered a slot by Bill Graham as an opener for an upcoming show at San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium after Graham was impressed with Santana's performance with Paul Butterfield at the same venue in late January. In February 1967, his group, the Santana Blues Band, was officially formed when guitarist Tom Fraser invited Carlos Santana to jam with his friend Gregg Rolie, after seeing Santana play with Butterfield at the Fillmore. The band's first performance was on March 1, 1967 at The Ark club located inside a converted ferry boat in Sausalito, California. At the second show on March 17 at the Winchester Cathedral in Redwood City, California, the band was paid $75 for their performance, and allegedly, future drummer Michael Shrieve was in the audience at that show. After a hiatus due to Santana being treated for tuberculosis, the group opened for the Who at the Fillmore on June 16 and 17, 1967, but the band was blacklisted from performing at the venue due to players Sergio \"Gus\" Rodriguez and Danny Haro showing up late for the gig on the 17th. In July, manager Stan Marcum made Santana remove Rodriguez and Haro from the band, and Haro was replaced by Bob Wehr for one performance at the Grant & Green jazz bar, where David Brown was asked to join after the performance. The band will later open for the Who in 1982. In November 1967, the band changed their name to Santana. === Live releases === Live material from these performances has appeared on the following: * Songs from the band's shows from December 19 to 22, 1968 were released on the 1998 live album Live at the Fillmore 1968. * A performance from 1968 was released as The Very Best of Santana \u2013 Live in 1968 in 2007. === Tour band === * Gregg Rolie \u2013 lead vocals, Hammond organ, piano * Carlos Santana \u2013 lead guitar, percussion, vocals * Tom Fraser \u2013 rhythm guitar (through August 1967) * Sergio \"Gus\" Rodriguez \u2013 bass guitar (through July 1967) * David Brown \u2013 bass guitar (beginning July 1967) * Danny Haro \u2013 drums (through July 1967) * Bob Wehr \u2013 drums (in July 1967) * Rod Harper \u2013 drums (from July to November 1967) * Bob \"Doc\" Livingston \u2013 drums (beginning November 1967) * Michael Carabello \u2013 congas, percussion (to July 1967) * Marcus Malone \u2013 congas, percussion (beginning July 1967) === Set list === The group's set list usually consisted of covers of Latin music and blues songs, such as Willie Bobo's \"Fried Neckbones and Some Homefries\" and Chico Hamilton's \"Conquistadore Rides Again.\" The set list of the live album Live at the Fillmore 1968 consists of the following: # \"Jingo\" (Babatunde Olatunji) # \"Persuasion\" (Gregg Rolie) # \"Treat\" (Carlos Santana, Rolie, David Brown) # \"Chunk a Funk\" (Santana, Rolie) # \"Fried Neckbones and Some Homefries\" (Willie Bobo, Melvin Lastie) # \"Conquistadore Rides Again\" (Chico Hamilton) # \"Soul Sacrifice\" (Santana, Rolie, Marcus Malone, Brown) # \"As the Years Go Passing By\" (Deadric Malone) # \"Freeway\" (Santana, Rolie) === Performance dates === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of tour dates with date, city, country, venue !

Schon joined the group in December 1970 after declining an invitation to be a part of Derek and the Dominos. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave their music a tougher sound. In January 1971, drugs were becoming a problem in the group, so Carlos Santana spoke to Michael Carabello about this problem, but it will be a long time before they fixed the problem. Around the same time, Jos\u00e9 Areas was stricken with a near-fatal brain hemorrhage, and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (Willie Bobo played with the group for the sole African concert), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate. In March 1971, Coke Escovedo joined the group, and these problems plagued the group into the start of the next tour. === Live releases === Live material from this tour has appeared on a number of different releases: * \"Toussaint L'Overture\" and \"Evil Ways\" from the concert on August 18, 1970 in Lenox, Massachusetts were released on the 1988 video Viva Santana! An Intimate Conversation With Carlos Santana. * \"Jungle Strut\", \"Waiting\", \"Black Magic Woman\", and \"Gypsy Queen\" from the show on March 6, 1971 in Ghana were released on the 1971 film Soul to Soul. === Reception === Billboard described one of the band's shows on August 10, 1970 at the Fillmore East in New York City as \"exciting.\" === Tour band === * Gregg Rolie \u2013 lead vocals, Hammond organ, piano, percussion * Carlos Santana \u2013 guitar, percussion, vocals * Neal Schon \u2013 guitar * David Brown \u2013 bass guitar * Michael Shrieve \u2013 drums * Michael Carabello \u2013 percussion, vocals * Jos\u00e9 \u201dChepito\u201d Areas \u2013 timbales, congas, percussion, trumpet (on all dates but March 6, 1971) * Willie Bobo \u2013 percussion (on March 6, 1971) * Coke Escovedo \u2013 timbales, percussion (beginning on March 20, 1971) === Typical set lists === This is a usual set list of the group's concerts in 1970 (actual set list taken from the August 18 Lenox show): All songs written by the members of Santana unless otherwise specified. # \"Batuka\" (Jos\u00e9 Areas, David Brown, Michael Carabello, Gregg Rolie, Michael Shrieve) # \"Se Acab\u00f3\" (Areas) # \"Black Magic Woman\" (Peter Green) # \"Gypsy Queen\" (G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3) # \"Oye Como Va\" (Tito Puente) # \"Incident at Neshabur\" (Alberto Gianquinto, Carlos Santana) # \"Toussaint L'Overture\" # \"Evil Ways\" (Clarence \"Sonny\" Henry) # \"Hope You're Feeling Better\" (Rolie) # \"Treat\" # \"Savor\" # \"Jin-go-lo-ba\" (Babatunde Olatunji # \"Soul Sacrifice\" (Santana, Rolie, Brown, Marcus Malone) # \"Gumbo\" (Santana, Rolie) # \"Persuasion\" This is an average set list of the group's performances in 1971 (actual set list taken from the March 23 Inglewood show): # \"Waiting\" # \"Ballin'\" (Carlos Santana, Gregg Rolie) # \"Black Magic Woman\" (Peter Green) # \"Gypsy Queen\" (G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3) # \"Oye Como Va\" (Tito Puente) # \"Samba Pa Ti\" (Santana) # \"Toussaint L'Overture\" # \"Evil Ways\" (Clarence \"Sonny\" Henry) # \"Incident at Neshabur\" (Gianquinto, Santana) # \"Jungle Strut\" (Gene Ammons) # \"Everybody's Everything\" (Santana, Milton Brown, Tyrone Moss) # \"Gumbo\" (Santana, Rolie) # \"Black Magic Woman (Reprise)\" (Green) # \"Oye Como Va (Reprise)\" (Puente) # \"Guajira\" (Jos\u00e9 Areas, David Brown, Rico Reyes) === Tour dates === ==== North American leg (August 4, 1970 \u2013 January 1, 1971) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of tour dates with date, city, country, venue !

Due to David Brown's severe heroin use, he was replaced by Tom Rutley in August. In late September, due to an argument, the group toured without Carlos Santana, which Santana dismissed the group minis him as a \"Santana tribute.\" In mid-October, Santana returned to the band, and Michael Carabello was taken out of the group. Santana returned because during a series of shows in New York City, the group was booed because Santana wasn't playing with them. An audience member from one of these shows, Mingo Lewis was chosen to play with the group in the meantime. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru in December. The group was supposed to perform on December 11 at the Estadio Universidad Nacional Mayor San Marcos in Lima, but they were deported back to the United States due to student protests against U.S. governmental policies. Even if around five million soles were sold in tickets, the concert was cancelled and its cancellation was announced on December 10 by the Minister of the Interior. === Live releases === Live material from this tour that has seen release all comes from the group's performance at the Fillmore West in San Francisco on July 4 and has appeared on the following: * \"Incident at Neshabur\" was released on the 1988 compilation album Viva Santana!. * \"Incident at Neshabur\" and \"In a Silent Way\" was released on the 1972 live album Fillmore: The Last Days and the 1972 film Fillmore. * \"In a Silent Way\" was released on the 1995 box set Dance of the Rainbow Serpent. * \"Toussaint L'Overture\" was released on the 1999 compilation album Rare Rock Tracks (11 Previously Unreleased Performances). * The group's entire set minis \"Soul Sacrifice\" was released on the 2006 Legacy Edition of Santana III. === Tour band === * Gregg Rolie \u2013 lead vocals, Hammond organ, piano, percussion * Carlos Santana \u2013 guitar, percussion, vocals (from June 10 to September 24, returning mid-October) * Neal Schon \u2013 guitar * Michael Shrieve \u2013 drums * David Brown \u2013 bass guitar (through July 18) * Tom Rutley \u2013 bass guitar (beginning September 16) * Jos\u00e9 \u201dChepito\u201d Areas \u2013 timbales, congas, percussion, trumpet * Michael Carabello \u2013 congas, percussion, vocals (through July 18) * Coke Escovedo \u2013 timbales, percussion (through October 12) * James \u201dMingo\u201d Lewis \u2013 congas, percussion (beginning mid-October) === Set list === This is a usual set list of this tour (actual set list taken from the September 28 Denver show): # \"Batuka\" (Jos\u00e9 Areas, David Brown, Michael Carabello, Gregg Rolie, Michael Shrieve) # \"No One to Depend On\" (Carabello, Coke Escovedo, Rolie, Willie Bobo, Melvin Lastie) # \"Taboo\" (Areas, Rolie) # \"Se Acab\u00f3\" (Areas) # \"Waiting\" (Carlos Santana) # \"Incident at Neshabur\" (Alberto Gianquinto, Santana) # \"Black Magic Woman\" (Peter Green) # \"Gypsy Queen\" (G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3) # \"Oye Como Va\" (Tito Puente) # \"In a Silent Way\" (Joe Zawinul) # \"Marbles\" (John McLaughlin) # \"Toussaint L'Overture\" (Areas, Brown, Carabello, Rolie, Santana, Shrieve) # \"Evil Ways\" (Clarence \"Sonny\" Henry) # \"Para los Rumberos\" (Puente) # \"Soul Sacrifice\" (Santana, Rolie, Brown, Marcus Malone) === Tour dates === ==== U.S. leg (June 10 \u2013 September 18) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of tour dates with date, city, country, venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em;\"|Date (1971) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:13em;\"|City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"|Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22em;\"|Venue |- |June 10 |Louisville | rowspan=\"9\" |United States |Kentucky Exposition Center |- |June 11 |Milwaukee |Milwaukee Auditorium |- |June 12 |Indianapolis |Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum |- |June 13 (2 shows) |Chicago |International Amphitheatre |- |July 4 |San Francisco |Fillmore West |- |July 18 |Stanford |Laurence Frost Amphitheater |- |September 16 |Spokane |Spokane Coliseum |- |September 17 | rowspan=\"2\" |Seattle | rowspan=\"2\" |Seattle Center Coliseum |- |September 18 |} ==== Brazilian show (September 24) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of tour dates with date, city, country, venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em;\"|Date (1971) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:13em;\"|City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"|Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22em;\"|Venue |- |September 24 |Rio de Janeiro |Brazil |Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro |} ==== North American leg (September 28 \u2013 December 6) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of tour dates with date, city, country, venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em;\"|Date (1971) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:13em;\"|City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"|Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22em;\"|Venue |- |September 28 | rowspan=\"3\" |Denver | rowspan=\"6\" |United States | rowspan=\"3\" |Denver Coliseum |- |September 29 |- |September 30 |- |October 1 |Cincinnati |Cincinnati Gardens |- |October 2 |Cleveland |Public Auditorium |- |October 4 |Detroit |Detroit Olympia |- |October 5 |Toronto |Canada |Massey Hall |- |October 7 |Buffalo | rowspan=\"15\" |United States |N/A |- |October 8 |Syracuse |Onondaga County War Memorial |- |October 11 |Boston |Boston Garden |- |October 12 |Washington, D.C. |D.C.

It started on September 4, 1972, at the Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival in Griffin, Indiana, and ended on October 21, 1973 at Ginasio Municipal Novo in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil. This tour could be considered to be the group's most eclectic tour at this point, as the band did concerts at every continent except Africa and Antarctica, including one of the first, if not the first, tours of Latin America by a major American rock act. The tour was the first and only tour to feature the group's second lineup, \"The New Santana Band\", consisting of guitarist Carlos Santana, percussionists Armando Peraza and Jos\u00e9 Areas, bassist Doug Rauch, drummer Michael Shrieve, and Tom Coster and Richard Kermode on keyboards. The group often performed material from Caravanserai along with other improvisations and covers. Some concerts were recorded and filmed and released as albums and films. The shows on July 3 and 4, 1973 at the Osaka K\u014dsei Nenkin Kaikan in Osaka, Japan were released as the triple vinyl LP Lotus (1974). Select concerts during the tour's Latin American portion were filmed and incorporated into the documentary, Santana en Colores (1973). == Welcome Tour (1973\u20131974) == The Welcome Tour was a concert tour by Santana promoting their album, Welcome. The tour began on November 13, 1973 at Colston Hall in Bristol, England and ended on October 29, 1974 at the William P. Cole, Jr. Student Activities Building in College Park, Maryland. == Borboletta Tour (1974\u20131975) == The Borboletta Tour was the sixth concert tour by American rock band Santana in 1974 and 1975 in support of their album Borboletta. === History === After a performance in Honolulu, Hawaii, Santana toured Japan in November\u2013December 1974. After the conclusion of the Japanese tour, the group performed extensively in North America from March to September 1975 with Eric Clapton and his band. Then, the band toured with Earth, Wind & Fire in Europe. The European tour is notable as the group played two shows in Yugoslavia on October 4 and 5, 1975, their first performances behind the Iron Curtain. The singer of the opening act for the show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on April 11, 1975, Alex Ligertwood of Tone, influenced Carlos Santana to enroll him into Santana in 1979 because he was enamored by his performance. === Tour band === * Leon Patillo \u2013 lead vocals, piano, organ (through November 15, 1975) * Greg Walker \u2013 lead vocals, percussion (beginning December 4, 1975) * Carlos Santana \u2013 guitar, percussion, vocals * Tom Coster \u2013 Yamaha organ, Hammond organ, Minimoog, electric piano, percussion, vocals * David Brown \u2013 bass guitar * Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler \u2013 drums * Armando Peraza \u2013 congas, percussion === Typical set lists === ==== November\u2013December 1974: Asian tour ==== After a show in Hawaii, the group embarked on 16-date tour of Japan, starting on November 23, 1974 at Kanazawa City Tourism Center in Kanazawa, and ending on December 14, 1974 in Fukuoka Kyuden Kinen Gymnasium in Fukuoka.
