The brand offers products in sizes ranging from petite to plus. The company was started by Morgan Hermand-Waiche in 2010 while he was an MBA student at Harvard Business School. ==History== Adore Me was founded by Morgan Hermand-Waiche. He first got the idea of lingerie company in 2010 during his second year at Harvard Business School\u2019s M.B.A program, when he couldn't find lingerie that was both high quality and affordable. Hermand-Waiche spent three years working at management consulting firm McKinsey & Company prior to Adore Me. where he met Romain Liot, who came on in the early days as COO. Gary Bravard Gary Bravard, the current Head of Business Development, and Forbes Retail 30 under 30, also joined early on. Initial investors in Adore Me include Hermand-Waiche\u2019s Harvard professors, and angel investors Fabrice Grinda and Jose Marin. The company officially launched its website in March 2012. In the same year, Adore Me raised $2.5 million in its second round of funding with investments from Redhills Ventures, Jaina Capital, Ventech Capital, and other US angel investors. Adore Me reportedly sold 100,000 items in their first year of business. In July 2013, Adore Me raised $8.5 million from investors in a Series B round of funding. Investors included Upfront Ventures, Redhills Ventures, and Mousse Partners. In 2014, Adore Me was listed as the second fastest-growing private retail company on the Inc. 5000 list based on their 2013 sales of $5.6 million. They went on to generate $16.2 million in sales in 2014. In 2016, Adore Me was ranked #9 on Crain\u2019s list of New York\u2019s 50 Fastest-Growing Companies. Revenue for 2016 was $83.9 million.

As of 2017, Adore Me had 121 full-time employees. ==Resilient Retail== The company has outlined the management philosophy that has guided it since inception in a post from Hermand-Waiche entitled, Resilient Retail: The Adore Me model for ecommerce. The company has been guided by three principles that work together to allow a business to be built to respond to challenges unique in a digital world: Flexibility - Being long- term focused and smart around utilizing leverage. Hermand-Waiche first indicated the importance of being strategic and avoiding over-raising capital in a 2015 Techcrunch op-ed. Agility - Building technological and logistical infrastructure that allows constant evolution of services and products. The company has been recognized by publications like the MIT Technology Review for building cutting-edge infrastructure that positions the company well to compete in an increasingly automated and competitive retail world. Adaptability - Building a culture around hiring adaptive people who thrive on change and uncertainty. The combination of these three principles has helped the company navigate the incredibly turbulent pandemic period and achieve a record April, seeing 66% YoY growth. == Service == The company uses a style quiz and associated algorithm to recommend products and sizes to customers. Adore Me currently offers three ways to shop on their website: # Adore Me VIP: a monthly subscription box with lingerie from the 40-60 new designs that are released every month. # Adore Me Elite Membership Program: a fast-growing, subscription-based service launched in 2017 that lets customers try on items before they purchase them. # Adore Me Pay As You Go (PAYG) service: allows customers to make a one-time purchase. With a mobile app (both iOS and Android), 80% of Adore Me\u2019s shopper traffic comes in from mobile. == Technology == Since its inception, Adore Me has striven to be as much a technology company as a retailer. CEO Hermand-Waiche has argued that the trend of \"Outsourced Brands\", or DTC brands that avoid building their own technology and logistics infrastructure, are unable to scale in ways to meet the evolving demands of customers. Adore Me was one of the first retailers to use Angular technology \u2013 the complete JavaScript-based, open-source, front-end web application framework supported by Google \u2013 on its mobile and desktop websites. Its Chief Technology Officer, Bogdan Lucaciu, has been a strong proponent of agile development frameworks and experimentation, leading the development of an entire suite of proprietary retail technology that allows the team to deliver strong results in everything from conversion rates, to the optimization of marketing spend, to reducing waste and cost-saving in procurement. == Sustainability == Adore Me launched the Embrace Life, Disrupt Fashion initiative in 2019 to operationalize sustainability efforts across the entire organization. As of April 2020, the company has launched two sustainable collections and will be launching 10 new sustainable collections through 2020. In addition to sustainable brands, Adore Me is adamant that change must occur across the entire supply chain, optimizing their procurement processes to minimize waste and committing to no air-shipping. They have additionally integrated water-conserving, digital-printing into swimwear, are transitioning to fully biodegradable packaging. == Adore Me Services (AMS) == Adore Me owns and operates its own 130,000 square foot distribution center in Secaucus, New Jersey: Adore Me Services (AMS). The brand officially opened the center in January 2019, with the expressed goal of leveraging a collection of cutting-edge technologies to help rapidly introduce new ways (including addressing the logistical complexities of Adore Me's new try-at-home service) to shop, a series of satellite brands and servicing a network of physical retail stores. The MIT Technology Review recognized the automation technologies built into the AMS systems, including a high-density robotic storage and order picking system (AutoStore), two automated putwalls (OPEX Sure Sort), as an example of how a mid-sized retailer can compete with e-commerce giants like Amazon: \"by being smaller, closer to home, and more flexible.\"The combination of automation, along with a commitment to worker safety, helped Adore Me manage to maintain consistent delivery throughout a major surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. == Expansion into retail == In April 2016, Adore Me opened their first retail store as a showroom at their New York City headquarters.

The hybrid-bot enables Adore Me customers to receive live support via several messaging platforms. In the company's early days, many customers had complained about its use of the controversial practice of negative option billing. Adore Me offered the customers the choice of buying a product at full price or of buying the same product at a substantial discount by joining a membership club. The club then billed customers a fixed amount each month unless the customer bought lingerie or opted out for the month. While the membership may be cancelled, the customers have found it difficult to cancel. Following an investigation filed by the Federal Trade Commission about Adore Me's deceptive billing practices, the company agreed to refund up to $1.38 million to customers that had previously forfeited their store credits and to clearly disclose how much customers would pay on its monthly subscription plan.
