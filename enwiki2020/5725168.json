One is on e-learninghttp://elearn.bprim.org and other on the use of free open source software in Mathematics education (FOOSME). In the e-learning project video broadcasting of online Maths lectures is being done. The topics are Ring Theory and Complex Analysis. These lectures are at Undergraduate levels. The FOSSME project is all about exploring FOSS for Maths Education. There were 3 national level workshops held on FOSS for Maths education, Scilab,scilab.org Advanced and LaTeXhttp://www.tug.org Advanced. ==References== == External links == * Home Page of Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana * Home Page of FOSSME project Category:Research institutes in Pune Category:Mathematics education Category:Indian mathematics Category:1976 establishments in India Category:Research institutes in Maharashtra ",
