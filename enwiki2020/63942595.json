    "text": "Walter Rudolf Schweidler (born 15 September 1957) is a German philosopher. == Life == Since 2009, Schweidler has occupied the chair for philosophy at the Catholic University of Eichst\u00e4tt; having previously taught philosophy at the Ruhr University Bochum, the University of Dortmund, and PH Weingarten. He is a student of Robert Spaemann, and was his assistant from 1985 to 1992 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he completed graduate and postgraduate studies in philosophy, Catholic theology, political science and law. His master\u2019s thesis on Wittgenstein\u2019s concept of philosophy was published in 1983 (since translated in Italian), his doctoral dissertation, Die \u00dcberwindung der Metaphysik (\u201cThe Overcoming of Metaphysics\u201d) in 1987 (since translated into Japanese and French), and his habilitation thesis Geistesmacht und Menschenrecht (\u201cIntellectual Power and Human Rights\u201d) in 1994. Schweidler has lectured extensively abroad in the English-speaking world, with visiting professorships and research stays at the University of Minnesota, Macquarie University, the University of California at Berkeley (Graduate Theological Union), Manoa University in Honolulu and Loyola Marymount University. == Work == In his dissertation supervised by Robert Spaemann, Die \u00dcberwindung der Metaphysik, Schweidler deals with the distinction between metaphysical and philosophical thinking. In four paradigmatic investigations of the metaphysical critiques of Rudolf Carnap, Oswald Spengler, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, he elaborates the characteristics of what he refers to as philosophical \u201cintellectual power\u201d. Issuing from his lecturing activity in the area of practical, particularly political philosophy, his book Der gute Staat (\u201cThe Good State\u201d) was published in 2002. A book similarly directed toward practical philosophical concerns, \u00dcber Menschenw\u00fcrde (\u201cOn Human Dignity\u201d), was published in 2012. A further common denominator in Schweidler\u2019s work is the topic of time, in respect to which a systematic collection of his individual works in this area, made over several decades, was published as Das Uneinholbare (\u201cThe Uncatchable\u201d) in 2008. Further subjects and areas of research on which Schweidler has published concern contemporary and modern approaches to ethics and political philosophy, the philosophy of law and the theory of human rights, phenomenology, the philosophy of Heidegger in the context of the main currents of the 20th century, metaphysics and the critique of metaphysics; intercultural philosophy and bioethics. The question of what philosophy and what philosophical thought is persists as a recurrent theme in many of his works. Besides a series on phenomenology, edited together with Jean-Luc Marion, Schweidler is the editor of a series devoted to the East/West exchange of philosophical ideas, West-\u00f6stliche Denkwege (\u201cWest-Eastern Mindsets\u201d). == Honors and Awards == In 2006, Schweidler received the German Schoolbook Prize for the work edited together with Robert Spaemann, Ethik: Lehr- und Lesebuch (\u201cEthics: A Primer\u201d). He is a council member of the International Society for the Study of Time, a corresponding member of the Pontifical Academy for Life and a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. == Contributions (in English) == * \"On the Ontological Status of Trust: Robert Spaemann's Philosophy of the Person as a Promise\", in Trust: A Philosophical Approach (= Studies in Applied Philosophy, Epistemology and Rational Ethics, vol. 54), ed. by Adriano Fabris (Cham: Springer Nature, 2020), 113-122. * \"Time\u2019s Redeeming Urgency\", in Time\u2019s Urgency, ed. by Carlos Montemayor and Robert Daniel (Leiden: Brill, 2019), 291-301. * \"Wittgenstein, Goethe, and the Metonymic Principle\", in Wittgenstein, Philosopher of Cultures, ed. by Carl Humphries and Walter Schweidler (Sankt Augustin: Academia, 2017), 103-114. * \"Heideggers 'Dao'\", in Transcending Boundaries, ed. by Walter Schweidler (Sankt Augustin: Academia, 2015), 13-63. * \"The Culture of Life and its Reasons\", in Per una Cultura dell'Amore, ed. by Marcello Pera, Marek Jedraszewski and Walter Schweidler (Sienna: Edizioni Cantagalli, 2015), 129-247. * \"The Self-Repeating Origin: Ontological Aspects of Ricoeur's Concept of Hermeneutics\", in Hermeneutics and The Philosophy of Religion: The Legacy of Paul Ricoeur, ed. by Ingo Dalferth and Marlene Block (Heidelberg: Mohr Siebeck, 2015), 81-95. * \"On the Social Origin of Time in Language\", in Origins and Futures: Time Inflected and Reflected, ed. by Raji C.
