The song was performed second on the night (following Austria's Marty Brem with \"Wenn du da bist\" and preceding Germany's Lena Valaitis with \"Johnny Blue\"). At the close of voting, it had received 9 points, placing 18th (equaling Portugal) in a field of 20. The song is a mixture between the traditional Turkish music and the pop music. The lyrics made a comparison between life and a ferris wheel with ups and downs, the better is the true friendship, because is eternal. It was succeeded as Turkish representative at the 1982 Contest by Neco with \"Hani?\". ==References== * ==External links== *Eurovision Song Contest 1981 Official Page Category:Eurovision songs of Turkey Category:Eurovision songs of 1981 Category:1981 songs Category:Turkish- language songs ",
