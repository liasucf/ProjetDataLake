He was a producer of The War Tapes and The Station Agent, an executive producer of Stevie and The Fog of War, and the director and a producer of Kids for Cash. The Fog of War won the Academy Award for Best Documentary. ==Kids for cash== In the Kids for cash scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Wal-mart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. May directed Kids for Cash, a 2013 documentary film about the \"kids for cash\" scandal which unfolded in 2008 over judicial kickbacks in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. May is a critic of the School-to-prison pipeline and zero tolerance law enforcement for juveniles.http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post- Magazine/2014/June-1-2014/Directors-Chair-Robert-May-Kids-for-Cash.aspx In the documentary, May interviews experts on adolescent behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.http://jjie.org/a-plot-with-a-scandal-a- close-look-at-the-kids-for-cash- documentary/http://www.cinemaparadiso.co.uk/blog/film-reviews/kids-for-cash- review/ Critical response for Kids for Cash has been positive.
