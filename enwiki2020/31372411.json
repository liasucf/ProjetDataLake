    "text": "The Bendix AN/FPS-30 was a long-range search radar deployed at Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) sites in Greenland. It was an advancement over the AN/FPS-19 radars deployed in Alaska and Canada, being optimized for use in severe Arctic conditions. It was planned as a replacement, however cost constraints led to it only being installed at the Greenland DYE sites. ==References== * USAF Air Defense Radar Equipment ==External links== Category:Ground radars ",
