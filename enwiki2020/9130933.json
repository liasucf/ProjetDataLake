    "text": "Anne C. Zeller is a physical anthropologist who specializes in the study of primates. She received her M.A.(1971) and Ph.D (1978) from the University of Toronto. During her graduate studies she worked on chromosome analysis, comparing chimpanzee and human chromosomes. Anne has undertaken primate field research in Morocco, Gibraltar, Texas, Borneo and Africa. These two types of research combine interests in the physical development of humans from their primate ancestors, and the behavioral patterns of primates which are similar to those found among humans. However, her approach to physical anthropology is very wide-ranging and she has presented papers on witchcraft, dietary influences on behaviour, the role of children in evolution, and child abuse in primates, as well as on her major focus of primate communication. She is also interested in the use of film in research and teaching, has prepared video tapes for use in her classes and is analyzing film taken during her field research. Her current research concerns the interactions of adults and infants in the socializing process of Macaca fascicularis, the crab-eating macaque of Indonesia. Anne began teaching full-time at the University of Waterloo in the Department of Anthropology in 1982, and spent several years as the Chair or Head of Anthropology after 1993. Anne also held a series of positions at the University of Alberta, the University of Victoria and the University of Toronto. She retired from teaching in 2009. ==Filmography== *Chimpanzees Today *Five Species *Hominid Evolution 1: The Early Stages *Hominid Evolution 2: The Genus Homo *Images From the Field: Baboons *Lemurs of Madagascar *New World Monkeys *Primate-Human Interaction *Primate Patterns II *Sifakas of Madagascar *What Do Primatologists Do? ==Select publications== ===Journal articles=== * * * * * * * * * ===Book chapters=== * * * * * * * * * ==Related filmmakers== *John Marshall *Robert Gardner *Tim Asch ==References== * *Biography at University of Waterloo (website) ==External links== * (biographical information and links for Anne Zeller) Category:American anthropologists Category:Women primatologists Category:Visual anthropologists Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:University of Waterloo faculty Category:University of Alberta faculty Category:University of Victoria faculty Category:Anthropology educators Category:1947 births Category:Living people ",
