    "text": "Roger A. Pielke Jr. (born November 2, 1968) is an American political scientist and professor, and was the director of the Sports Governance Center within the Department of Athletics at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. He previously served in the Environmental Studies Program and was a Fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) where he served as Director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2001 to 2007. Pielke was a visiting scholar at Oxford University's Sa\u00efd Business School in the 2007-2008 academic year. A prolific writer, his interests include understanding the politicization of science; decision making under uncertainty; policy education for scientists in areas such as climate change, disaster mitigation, and world trade; and research on the governance of sports organizations, including FIFA and the NCAA. == Education and background == Pielke earned a B.A. in mathematics (1990), an M.A. in public policy (1992), and a Ph.D. in political science, all from the University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to his positions at CU-Boulder, from 1993 to 2001 he was a staff scientist in the Environmental and Societal Impacts Group of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. From 2002 to 2004 Pielke was Director of Graduate Studies for the CU-Boulder Graduate Program in Environmental Studies and in 2001 students selected him for the Outstanding Graduate Advisor Award. Pielke serves on numerous editorial boards and advisory committees, retains many professional affiliations, and sat on the Board of Directors of WeatherData, Inc. from 2001 to 2006. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Link\u00f6ping University and the Public Service Award of the Geological Society of America. == Professional writing == Pielke's early work was on the Space Shuttle program. In 1993 he argued that the shuttle was expensive and risky \u2014 that it was \"probable\" that another orbiter would be lost within 20-35 flights. Shortly before the loss of Columbia he warned that loss of another shuttle was only a matter of time. He has also been critical of the space station program. Pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy. He has written that he accepts the IPCC view of the underlying science, stating, \"The IPCC has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate. And on this basis alone I am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\" He also states that, \"Any conceivable emissions reductions policies, even if successful, cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades\", and from this he concludes that, \"In coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive.\" On the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors (chiefly an increase in wealth density), rather than change in the frequency and intensity. A \"Guide to Climate Skeptics\" published by Foreign Policy notes that Pielke's published views have led to him being considered by some a \"denier\" of climate change and by others as an \"alarmist\". His views on the IPCC consensus on climate change have been widely criticized by scientists, including former US presidential science adviser John Holdren. In October 2016, in a hacked email disclosed by WikiLeaks, Judd Legum states that a ThinkProgress blog was instrumental in his firing from the FiveThirtyEight website.Legum wrote: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair say that, without Climate Progress, Pielke would still be writing on climate change for 538\u201d. The Guardian published an article by Dana Nuccitelli called \"FiveThirtyEight undermines its brand by misrepresenting climate research\".Nuccitelli, Dana. \"FiveThirtyEight undermines its brand by misrepresenting climate research\", The Guardian, March 25, 2014, accessed October 27, 2016 In April 2015, Pielke joined with a group issuing An Ecomodernist Manifesto. The other authors were: John Asafu-Adjaye, Linus Blomqvist, Stewart Brand, Barry Brook. Ruth DeFries, Erle Ellis, Christopher Foreman, David Keith, Martin Lewis, Mark Lynas, Ted Nordhaus, Rachel Pritzker, Joyashree Roy, Mark Sagoff, Michael Shellenberger, Robert Stone, and Peter Teague. Pielke was named in a letter sent by Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ) to institutions that employed scientists who had testified to Congress about climate change. The letter stated, \"My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research or testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships,\" and requested information including the sources and amounts of outside funding for those scientists who had testified. Regarding conflict of interest disclosures, Pielke said that \"if you look at our community, the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly endemic.\" Targeted by crusading Congressman, scientist speaks out on conflicts, climate, and controversy AAAS ScienceInsider, 4 March 2015 == Publications== *Editor, with Daniel Sarewitz and Radford Byerly Jr., Prediction: Science, Decision Making, and the Future of Nature, Island Press; New title edition (April 1, 2000), hardcover, 400 pages, *The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics, Cambridge University Press (May 14, 2007), hardcover, 198 pages, *The Climate Fix: What Scientists and Politicians Won't Tell You About Global Warming, Basic Books (September 28, 2010), hardcover, 288 pages *The Rightful Place of Science: Disasters and Climate Change, Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes (November 1, 2014), trade paperback, 124 pages *List of publications at sciencepolicy.colorado.edu == See also == * Roger A.
