While these landmark apologies had been relatively fleeting media moments when they were first delivered, We Are Sorry prolonged their public presence. In Melbourne, We Are Sorry took place outdoors as part of the Laneway Commissions and the following year it was presented in Eckhardt Hall at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in conjunction with the launch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2010). ==References== ==External links== *Cathy Busby *PARKING 2019 *MOMMY Interview *Hyperallergic review of About Face *domus review of About Face *Public Acts *Canadian Art Magazine Category:Canadian contemporary artists Category:Living people Category:1958 births Category:Canadian poster artists Category:Canadian women artists Category:Artists from Nova Scotia Category:NSCAD University alumni Category:Women graphic designers ",
