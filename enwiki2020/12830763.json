    "text": "Portrait of Maurice Level Maurice Level (29 August 1875 \u2013 15 April 1926) was a French writer of fiction and drama who specialized in short stories of the macabre which were printed regularly in the columns of Paris newspapers and sometimes staged by le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol, the repertory company in Paris's Pigalle district devoted to melodramatic productions which emphasized blood and gore. Many of Level's stories have been translated into American newspapers since 1903, notably his well-known tale \"The Debt-Collector\" (at least eight different translations). Between 1917 and 1919 the literary editor of the New York Tribune, William L. McPherson (1865-1930), translated seventeen war tales (three of them anonymously), seven of them being collected in Tales of Wartime France (1918). In 1920, English journalist, editor and publisher Alys Eyre Macklin (ca. 1875-1929) arranged a treaty with Level to be his official literary agent for all English-language countries .Jean-Luc Buard, \"Alys Eyre Macklin, Maurice Level's English Friend and Translator\", afterword to Crises, vol. 1, Tales of Mystery and Horror, Mad Sheep, 2017., and translated a selection of 26 tales as Crises, Tales of Mystery and Horror (1920). Nine of them have been first published by Hearst's Magazine in New York in 1919-1920. Some other tales appeared later in various newspapers or magazines in England or in the USA, such as Pan (London), or in the well-known pulp magazine Weird Tales.Stefan R. Dziemianowicz, \"Introduction\", to 100 Wild Little Weird Tales,edited by Robert Weinberg, Dziemianowicz and Martin H. Greenberg, Barnes and Noble, 1994 (pp. xvii-xix). . H. P. Lovecraft observed of Level's fiction in his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927): \"This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself \u2014 the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations and gruesome physical horrors\". Critic Philippe Gontier wrote: \"We can only admire, now almost one hundred years later, the great artistry with which Maurice Level fabricated his plots, with what care he fashioned all the details of their unfolding and how with a master's hand he managed the building of suspense\". Thanks to Lovecraft, Maurice Level has been recognized in the United State and also in Japan as a little master of the horrible, when he was forgotten in his own country, France during the major part of the XXth century. He was still in print in both these countries in the years 2000. Since 2017, various new editions of his works have been reissued in France, with new critical material. ==Selected works in French== *L'\u00e9pouvante: Roman (1908) novel, translated as Terror (newspaper serial, US, 1908-09) The Grip of Fear (UK, 1909; US, 1911) *Les Portes de l'Enfer (1910) short stories *Les Oiseaux de nuit (1913) short stories *Mado ou les mille joies du m\u00e9nage (1914) humorous sketches *Vivre pour la patrie (1917) novel *L'Alouette: Roman (1918) *Mado ou la Guerre \u00e0 Paris (1919) humorous sketches *Le Manteau d'arlequin: Roman (1919) *Barrabas: Roman (1920) *L'Ombre: Roman (1921) Novel translated as The Shadow (UK, 1923) Those who return (US, 1923) *Le Crime: Roman (1921) *Au pays du Tendre (1921) *Les morts \u00e9tranges (1921) short stories *L'\u00cele sans nom (1922) *L'Ame de minuit (serial, 1923 ; first book publication in 2017, Lulu.com, ) *La Cit\u00e9 des voleurs: Roman (1924) *Le Marchand de secrets (1928) *L'Egnime de Bellavista (1928) prequel to Le Marchand de secrets *Contes du Matin 1921-1924, sous la direction litt\u00e9raire de Colette, preface by Jean-Luc Buard, La Biblioth\u00e8que Maurice Level/The International Maurice Level Library, 2017 () *Contes de guerre 1914-1922, edited by Jean-Luc Buard, AARP/Centre Rocambole/Encrage, 2017 () *Un maniaque et autres contes de l'Auto, 1904-1910, preface by Jean-Luc Buard, \"La Biblioth\u00e8que Maurice Level\"/Lulu.com, 2018 () ==Selected works in English== *The Grip of Fear (1909) *Crises: Tales of Mystery and Horror (UK, 1920) 26 short stories translated by Alys Eyre Macklin **a.k.a.
