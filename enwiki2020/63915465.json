    "text": "H\u00e1r (also H\u00e1vi; Old Norse: 'High One') and H\u00e1rr (Old Norse: probably 'One- eyed') are among the many names of Odin. The Prose Edda depicts H\u00e1r in particular as one of the figures in the legendary trio that respond to the questions posed by Gangleri, along with Jafnh\u00e1rr ('Equally-High') and \u00deri\u00f0i ('Third'). == Name == The Old Norse name H\u00e1r means 'High' or 'High One', stemming from Proto-Norse *hauhaR. In the eddic poem H\u00e1vam\u00e1l (Songs of H\u00e1vi), Odin adopts the name H\u00e1vi as a variant form of H\u00e1r. According to the catalogue in the V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 (Prophecy of the V\u00f6lva), H\u00e1r is also the name of a dwarf. The origin of the name H\u00e1rr remains unclear.; A number of scholars, including Jan de Vries, E. O. G. Turville-Petre and Vladimir Orel, have proposed the meaning 'One-eyed'. The word may derive from a Proto-Norse form *Haiha-hariR ('the One-eyed Hero'), itself a derivative of the Proto-Germanic root *haihaz ('one- eyed'; compare with Gothic haihs 'one-eyed').; ; ; A Proto-Indo-European origin is also suggested by the Latin caecus ('blind') and the Old Irish caech ('one-eyed'). H\u00e1rr has also been interpreted as 'the hoary one', 'with grey hair and beard', or as an adjectival form of the lexeme H\u00e1r ('High One'). == Attestations == In Gylfaginning (The Beguiling of Gylfi), the king Gylfi, assuming the form of an old man named Gangleri, comes to visit the place of the gods \u00c1sgard. But the \u00c6sir (gods), who have foreseen his journey, prepare a visual delusion where Gilfy thinks he arrives at a great hall where he meets the chiefains H\u00e1r ('High'), Jafnh\u00e1rr ('Equally-high'), and \u00deri\u00f0i ('Third'). Then Gangleri asks the three men a series of questions about the identity of gods or the creation of the cosmos. The answers are usually given by H\u00e1r with occasional amplification by Jafnh\u00e1rr or \u00deri\u00f0i. Finally, Gangleri asks about Ragnar\u00f6k and its aftermath, then he hears a crash and the hall disappears. A variant of H\u00e1r, H\u00e1vi, appears in the poem H\u00e1vam\u00e1l (Words of H\u00e1vi [the High One]) as the name of Odin. == See also == * High, Just-as-High, and Third * List of names of Odin == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * * Category:Names of Odin ",
