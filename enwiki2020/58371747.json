After the transfer of the business office to Berlin in 1936, the German Central Cooperative Fund and most of the Central Commercial Funds participated in the company, which was meanwhile called Gesellschaft f\u00fcr zweitstelligen Grundkredit, Deutscher Bausparer Aktiengesellschaft. In 1941 the Volksbanks followed, since then it was called Bausparkasse der deutschen Volksbanken. The company headquarter was bombed out in 1943, 1944 the operation together with the rescued business documents was moved to Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. The decision to retain this city as a corporate seat was made in 1947. At that time the creation of new housing was important, which was promoted from 1952 with the housing subsidy by the state. Since the conversion into the common mortgage lending institute of the Volksbanks and the Raiffeisenverband in 1956, the enterprise bears the name Bausparkasse Schw\u00e4bisch Hall AG. 1970 the last name changes to Bausparkasse Schw\u00e4bisch Hall AG, Bausparkasse der Volksbanken und Raiffeisebanken took place. As a result of the fall of the Berlin wall, the company was able to extended its business to the new federal states in 1990. The legal change in the year 1991 caused that for the first-time own holding companies could be established abroad. Branches in Luxembourg and France and subsidiaries in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary and the China were founded. == Core business areas of the building society Schw\u00e4bisch Hall == * Mortgage lending * Construction Financing * Cross selling * Foreign countries == Subsidiary companies == * Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Kreditservice GmbH * Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Facility Management GmbH * Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Training GmbH == Key figures == {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"empty-cells:show; border- collapse:collapse;\" |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !
