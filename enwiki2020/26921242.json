The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTF. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Rachel performed 7th in the running order, following Austria and preceding the United Kingdom. \"Le chant de Mallory\" was a distinctive song with unusual lyrics and the sound of a traditional song handed down through generations. As with all the 1964 entries, only an audio recording of Rachel's performance is known to survive as the video master of the contest is believed to have been lost in a fire at the Danish TV archive during the 1970s. Each national jury awarded 5-3-1 to their top three songs, and at the close \"Le chant de Mallory\" had picked up 14 points (5 from Monaco, 3 from Austria and Portugal, and 1 from Luxembourg, Spain and Yugoslavia), placing France joint 4th (with Luxembourg) of the 16 entries. The French jury awarded its 5 points to Monaco.ESC History - France 1964 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1964 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1964 in France ",
