The game is named after Lucinda Green, a six-time Badminton Horse Trials winner, who also serves as in game mentor. == Reception == IGN felt it offered a more professional experience than contemporary horse-related games, an deemed it an \"off-beat, niche title\" from the developer. JeuxVideo wrote that it \" manages to strike a balance between its ambitions of pure simulation and its desire for accessibility to a wide audience\". Lapresse notes that many horse themes titles were released throughout 2007. Jeuxactu felt it would carry players over until the next major release in the genre. Heise wrote that it was \"quite unmistakably a computer game for girls\". Meanwhile, PSM3 Magazine UK said \"LGEC works, just, but there's really 'neigh' point in playing it\". == References == Category:2006 video games Category:Horse-related video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Windows games ",
