These flies have a broad-built and slightly hairy body. The thorax is black and has two gray, narrow longitudinal stripes and a gray lateral band. In the male the abdomen is orange-brown with black markings, The female has a black abdomen with gray margins. The wings are large and strongly patterned, with dark brown veins. The legs are slim and yellow-brown colored. At the head there are the short, thick proboscis as well as the green compound eyes. Females of this species are very similar to Ibisia marginata, but the latter has entirely black legs.Atherix ibis on Flickr The larvae of these flies are greenish-brown and reach a length of up to 20 millimeters. They have seven pairs of abdominal prolegs on the last segment. ==Biology== Adults can be found from May to July. Oviposition begins in early June. The females, after mating, aggregate in large clumps and lay egg masses on tree branches overhanging rivers or under bridges over flowing waters. After a female has started laying eggs, the others follow soon. In such a way the first stage larvae will fall into the water, where they will start their life cycle.Bent Lauge Madsen Biological studies on adult water snipe fly, Atherix ibis (Fabricius, 1798) (Diptera: Athericidae): Old myths and new facts After oviposition, the females die, causing lumps of thousands of dead flies and their eggs. The larvae are predators. In fact a few days after oviposition, the larvae hatch and at first feed on the dead parents. Later, they fall into the water and feed on carrion, detritus and small invertebrates such as stoneflies, mayflies and caddisflies. They usually kill their preys with a poisonous bite. The larvae occur mainly in clean, moderate to fast-flowing waters with stony or gravelly ground. Whether the adult flies are predators, feed on nectar or whether they are bloodsucking, it is not completely clear. ==Bibliography== * A.
