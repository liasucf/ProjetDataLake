He scored his first first-team goal for Walsall in a 2\u20131 pre- season friendly win against Chester in July 2017. Despite a promising pre- season, Candlin managed only four further first team appearances in the 2017\u201318 season. On the final day of the August transfer window in 2018, Candlin signed on loan with Blackburn Rovers with a view to making the move permanent on 1 January 2019. However, after failing to make a first-team appearance and only limited game time for the club's U23 side, Rovers opted not to complete the transfer and Candlin returned to Walsall in January 2019. In September 2019 he joined Nuneaton Borough on a short-term loan deal.https://www.bescotbanter.net/2019/09/mitchel-candlin-joins-nuneaton- borough.html He scored his first goal for Nuneaton in a 4\u20130 home win against Stourbridge on 17 September and went on to make 11 appearances and score 3 goals.
