The rector of the university currently is Prof. Luc de Schepper, the vice rectors are Prof. Karin Coninx and Prof. Jean-Michel Rigo. ==History== Hasselt University - Oude Gevangenis Hasselt University was officially established in 1971 as \u2018Limburgs Universitair Centrum\u2019 (LUC), but it was not until 1973 that the university \u2013 literally \u2013 opened its doors and welcomed its first students. Until 1991 the university was, in fact, an undergraduate level university institution with two faculties: the Faculty of Medicine-Dentistry and the Faculty of Sciences (with study programmes in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Biology). In 1991 the university expanded the reach of its curriculum by transforming the Limburg Business School (Economische Hogeschool Limburg), an independent university college which was located on the same campus in Diepenbeek, into the Faculty of Applied Economics. At the same time, Hasselt University became entitled to organize postgraduate programmes and award doctoral degrees in its three faculties. Briefly Hasselt University is a young university that has achieved enormous growth in the past four decades. 1973 The Limburg University Centre (LUC for short) \u2013 the predecessor of Hasselt University - officially opens to students in Diepenbeek, two years after the legal authorisation of the creation of an autonomous university institution in Limburg. LUC starts with six programmes: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, dentistry and medicine. 1991 Limburg Economic University College is integrated into LUC and becomes the Faculty of Economic Science (now the Faculty of Business Economics). 2002 LUC and Maastricht University jointly establish the Transnational University of Limburg (tUL) \u2013 an internationally unique partnership of two universities in two countries. The computer science, statistics and biomedical sciences programmes are organised under the tUL umbrella. 2003 LUC and the Limburg university colleges PHL and XIOS (which have since merged to form PXL University College) together form the Limburg University and Colleges Association (AUHL). 2004 The Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s programmes in transportation sciences \u2013 the only ones of their kind in Flanders \u2013 are added to the curriculum. 2005 The Limburg University Centre is renamed Hasselt University, or UHasselt for short. 2008/2011 Hasselt University launches its Bachelor of Law degree, a collaboration with Maastricht University and KU Leuven. Three years later, a Master\u2019s programme in law follows. 2012 Hasselt University opens a second campus: the \u2018urban campus\u2019 in the centre of Hasselt. Hasselt Campus includes the Rectorate Building, the Law Faculty building and \u2013 right at the centre \u2013 the Oude Gevangenis (Old Prison). This is the place where law students attend classes and where new students must register. 2013 Four new programmes are introduced in Hasselt University in the academic year 2013-2014: \u2022 architecture \u2022 interior architecture \u2022 engineering technology \u2022 rehabilitation sciences and physiotherapy At the same time, two new faculties are established: \u2022 Faculty of Architecture and Art \u2022 Faculty of Engineering Technology This increases the number of faculties from four (Business Economics, Medicine and Life Sciences, Law and Sciences) to six. 2014 Hasselt University establishes the School of Transportation Sciences and the Hasselt University School for Expert Education (UHasselt SEE). 2015 The Faculty of Business Economics launches the business administration programme.https://www.uhasselt.be/UH/Hasselt-University/About- UHasselt/About-us/History.html ===International collaborations=== In 2001 the Flemish and Dutch Ministers of Education signed an International Treaty by which the transnational University Limburg (tUL) was founded. Academic staff from Hasselt University and from nearby Maastricht University (in the Dutch Province of Limburg) since then jointly undertake research activities and offer degree programmes in Life Sciences and Computer Sciences. ===Limburg Association of Higher Education=== In 2002 Hasselt University, together with Hogeschool PXL established the Limburg Association of Higher Education (AUHL). The AUHL was founded to enhance cooperation between higher education institutions in the region. Cycling path towards campus Diepenbeek ===New city campus=== In the past decade Hasselt University has expanded its curriculum thoroughly. Since September 2004,the university offers a unique programme (bachelor and master) in Transportation Sciences. A bachelor programme in Law was established in September 2008, in cooperation with Maastricht University and KU Leuven. Three years later a master programme in Law was created. 2012 proved to be a new milestone in the university\u2019s young existence, with the inauguration of the \u2018city campus\u2019 in Hasselt. ===Higher education reform=== In September 2013 four new (bachelor and master) programmes were added to the university\u2019s curriculum: Architecture, Interior Design, Rehabilitation Sciences & Physiotherapy and Industrial Sciences. This expansion also entailed the creation of two new faculties: the Faculty of Architecture & Arts and the Faculty of Engineering Technology. That brings the total number of faculties to six, alongside the Faculty of Business Economics, Faculty of Medicine & Life Sciences, Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Law. In 2014, the School of Transportation Sciences was established. Hasselt University is home to about 6,000 students and 1,200 academic, administrative and technical staff members. ==Campuses== Universiteit Hasselt - Campus Diepenbeek ===Campus Hasselt=== The head office of Hasselt University is located at campus Hasselt. The complex consists of three buildings, located near each other: the Vice Chancellor\u2019s Office Building, the Faculty of Law and the \u2018Oude Gevangenis\u2019 (the renovated \u2018Old City Jail\u2019). The former city prison provides a new home to primarily law students, with several study rooms and two auditoriums. The Student Service Center, where enrollment of new students takes place, is also located in the \u2018Oude Gevangenis\u2019. ===Campus Diepenbeek=== Since 1973 Hasselt University is located on the Campus Diepenbeek, which occupies a 75-acre site. Moreover, several institutes for applied research, an incubator for starting small enterprises, and several small businesses interacting with the research activities of the university are located on campus Diepenbeek. Building D includes the agora, the student restaurant and the library. ==Programmes== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Faculty !! Bachelor's programmes !!
