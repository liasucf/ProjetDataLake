A juried festival, MAD was created in 1995 to present and celebrate the best of Georgia's diverse modern and contemporary dance scene. The MAD Festival is currently presented as two nights of performances. Also under the umbrella of the festival are events such as the 24-hour dance festival and the Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award. The 24-hour dance festival is a project in which choreographers and dancers are locked in studios for 24 hours to create work. At the end of the 24-hour period, all of these works are presented and then the top two pieces perform their newly created works to open the core show. The Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award commemorates an individual who has contributed to the regional dance community. Choreographer and modern dance pioneer Ruth Mitchell, former dancer for Jose Limon and Ruth Page and director of Ruth Mitchell Dance Company, was the inaugural recipient in 2015. In 2016, the award was presented to Mozell Spriggs, founder of the Spelman College Dance Program. In 2017, it honored Bobby and Virginia Barnett. Lee Harper is the recipient of the 2018 award. Over the past two decades, Full Radius Dance has presented more than 65 companies and independent choreographers, and paid over $30,000 in honorariums to MAD participants. Entering its 24th year, the upcoming festival will be held May 2018 at the Balzer Theatre at Herren's in downtown Atlanta. ==References== ==External links== * Full Radius Dance website * NCHPAD: Physically Integrated Dance and Full Radius Dance Company Category:Dance companies in the United States Category:Dance education in the United States Category:Modern dance companies Category:Contemporary dance companies Category:Physically integrated dance Category:Dance in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
