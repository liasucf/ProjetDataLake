    "text": "Erika Nay Girardi (n\u00e9e Chahoy; born July 10, 1971), known professionally as Erika Jayne, is an American singer, actress and television personality. Her debut single \"Roller Coaster\" topped the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in 2007. She has attained nine number-one songs on the Dance Club Songs chart . In 2016, Billboard ranked her number 42 on their list of greatest dance club artists of all time and number 3 on their list of the Next Big Sound. Girardi launched her film and television career as an actress in the early 1990s, playing small roles on Law & Order and High Incident. In 2015, Girardi became a full-time cast member on the sixth season of the reality television series The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, followed by her role on the competition series Dancing with the Stars in 2017. She has played a recurring role as real estate agent Farrah Dubose on the American television soap opera The Young and the Restless. She made her Broadway debut in Chicago as Roxie Hart on January 6, 2020. ==Life and career== === 1971\u20131998: Early life and career beginnings === Erika Girardi was born in Atlanta, Georgia on July 10, 1971, to a single mother, Renee Chahoy. Her mother, a fellow actress and a classically trained pianist, was only 18 when she gave birth to Girardi. Her parents broke up before her first birthday. Describing her childhood in her book Pretty Mess, Girardi states that her mother was \"short with me, hard on me, and irritable. She would snatch my ponytail, dig her nails into my arm, and step on my feet. And that was in public.\" Girardi was later adopted by her mother's new partner, and they were married and divorced twice. In the middle of the marriages, her stepfather legally adopted her, but cut off contact after the second divorce from her mother. Girardi met her biological father for the first time at the age of 25 and compared it to \"meeting a stranger\". Girardi has revealed that she has seen her biological father only twice after their first meeting, saying \"he had never, ever acknowledged my existence, to anyone, and obviously to himself, as well.\" Girardi has said that her tough upbringing made her grow up quickly and taught her to be self-reliant. She had a close relationship with her grandparents, Hollis and Ann Peek. Girardi's grandfather whom she called \"the only father I've ever known\", died in July 2010 at the age of 81. Her grandmother died of Alzheimer's disease in November 2014 at the age of 86. \"My grandmother and I used to speak on the phone for an hour every day about nothing. When those phone calls stopped, that was the hardest. Because I knew she could no longer communicate. I had always gotten such strength and such love from those phone calls and when they stopped, it was a real marker of, 'This is over, Erika. The woman that you know is no longer,'\" she said in an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Girardi graduated from North Atlanta High School. She enrolled in a magnet program for the performing arts in high school, saying, \"That\u2019s where you really learned to love the stage and really hone your early performing skills. I wouldn\u2019t trade that experience for anything in the world.\" She joined musical theater in high school, playing roles such as Val from A Chorus Line and Frastrada in Pippin. She toured the world in the school revue show where she performed \"9 to 5\" by Dolly Parton and \"Into The Groove\" by Madonna. Her first jobs in the entertainment industry included doing modelling and local commercials as a child. At 18, she moved to New York City. She performed as a member of several girl groups while living in New York, including recording songs with The Flirts and performing with I-Dolls. During this time she met Italian Thomas Zizzo, when he was working as a DJ at a club in Manhattan. The couple got married in December 1991 at St. Patrick's Cathedral. She described the wedding as \"big, obnoxious, and pink.\" Soon after she gave birth to a son, Thomas Zizzo, Jr. After the couple divorced a few years later, she relocated to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming a singer and performer. Early in her career, Girardi worked as a waitress to support herself between acting jobs. Girardi began her acting career in the early 1990s by appearing in small roles in several American television series and films. Her first on-screen appearance was a role as Suzanne Morton in the episode \"Prescription for Death\" of NBC's legal drama series Law & Order. She played the first-ever person to die on the show. In 1991, she made her second appearance on the show in the episode \"Violence of Summer\". She also had roles in independent films Alchemy (1995) and Lowball (1996). She appeared as Kitty in Alchemy, playing a woman who befriends her former partner's ex-wife after his death. She portrayed a struggling single mother, Kate in the action film Lowball alongside Erik Schrody and Luis Moro. In 1997, Girardi appeared as Cindy Butterworth in an episode of the police drama series High Incident. === 1999\u20132016: Debut album and television projects === In January 1999, she married attorney Thomas Girardi, a founding partner of Girardi & Keese in downtown Los Angeles. She has discussed spending her early 30s focusing on her life with her husband, saying: \"My husband is a lawyer, and I lived a lawyer's wife's life. I was with him all the time. And then, I finally said, 'You know what? I need to go back and perform and do what I love for me,' and that's how Erika Jayne was born.\" Girardi has called this period of her life \"great legal education\". \"I sat in so many meetings, dinners, and talks with the very best legal minds. I went to the U.S. Supreme Court to watch a session. We would go to the Senate to meet people and talk to them on an intimate level. This was not the kind of meet and greet where you shake a politician\u2019s hand and get a picture with him. No, we would have dinner with the mayor and his wife, and we\u2019d listen to what he thinks about the city\u2019s homeless problem. We would have drinks with a U.S. senator, and she\u2019d confide in us the problems the senators were having with the current administration. These were some great experiences,\" Girardi shared in her memoir, Pretty Mess. Staying true to her love of music, Jayne's first dance music single \"Roller Coaster\" was released on January 1, 2007. The song placed at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. Her second single \u201cStars\u201d also placed at number one the Billboard Dance Play chart and music video for the song spent 12 weeks (peaking at number 2) on Logo TV\u2019s The Click List: Top 10 Videos. In 2007, British newspaper The Guardian wrote that Erika Jayne \u201cis Madonna trapped in the moment when she recorded the Erotica album. She\u2019s Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge goes trance with a dash of debauchery, or Gwen Stefani goes burlesque.\u201d Jayne's debut full-length album Pretty Mess, was released in the United States on August 11, 2009. Sheila E. is found playing percussion on the song, \u201cTime to Realize\u201d and the album includes a cover of Apollonia 6\u2019s 1984 hit \u201cSex Shooter.\u201d Peter Rafelson and Eric Kupper served as producers and co-writers on Pretty Mess, while Canadian singer-songwriter Esthero, Jahi Lake and Ike Dirty contributed additional production.

She released three different music video versions of \"Give You Everything\". The music videos were directed by feature film director Marty Thomas. Remixes of \"Give You Everything\" placed at number 2 on the Music Week Upfront Club Chart as well as number 6 on the Music Week Commercial Pop Club Chart, marking her first time to land on the United Kingdom charts. Jayne supported the release of Pretty Mess with tour dates and appearances at festivals and clubs across the United States.

Her next releases, \"One Hot Pleasure\" and \"Party People (Ignite the World)\", also reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. \"Party People (Ignite the World)\" was written and produced by Swedish producers Andreas Carisson and Niclas Kings. The dance-driven music video for the single was directed and choreographed by Mikey Minden. \"Party People (Ignite the World)\" marked her sixth number-one single on US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.

Despite the song's popularity among fans, \"Cars\" still did not manage to make an impact on the charts.
