Due to internal problems, the band went into hiatus, but returned in 2008 to release the album Neblim, which included the tracks \"Miseric\u00f3rdia, Senhor\" and \"Ruah\". In 2009, the group won the first Louvemos ao Senhor Trophy in the Best Rock Album category. In 2010, the band released their first music video for the orchestrated version of their song \"Neblim\". In 2012, Iahweh's lead singer Andr\u00e9 Leite left the band to join the Rio De Janeiro-based group Hangar. On March 5, 2014, coinciding with the carnival on Ash Wednesday, Iahweh released a new clip with the participation of Father F\u00e1bio de Melo entitled \"Deserto,\" which was also the name of their third CD released later in the same month. == Members == * Andr\u00e9 Leite \u2013 Vocals * Toninho de Marco \u2013 Guitar * Alessandro Bittencourt \u2013 Bass * Tiago Mattos \u2013 Guitar * Eloy Casagrande \u2013 Drums === Past members === * Neli Sestari * J\u00falio C\u00e9sar == Discography == * 1996 \u2013 Alfa e \u00d4mega''' * 2008 \u2013 Neblim * 2014 \u2013 Deserto == Videography == === Videos === * 2010 \u2013 \"Neblim\" * 2014 \u2013 \"Deserto\" == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center; |- !Year !width=200|Album !Category !Result |- | 2009 | align=left|Neblim | I Louvemos o Senhor Trophy * Category 12: Best Rock Album | == See also == * Rosa de Saron * Ceremonya == References == Category:Brazilian Christian rock groups Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic musical groups Category:Musical groups from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2015 Category:Brazilian Christian metal musical groups Category:Musical quintets ",
