An ironist, satirist, volatile critic, and ground- breaking achiever in experimental auto-fiction, \u00de\u00f3rbergur arguably remains among Iceland's most beloved 20th century authors. \u00de\u00f3rbergur was an autodidact. As recounted in his largely autobiographical works, \u00cdslenzkur a\u00f0all (1938) and Ofvitinn (1940), \u00de\u00f3rbergur lived in poverty for much of his youth and early adulthood and could not afford secondary or higher education. == The 1934 trial for offending Nazis == In January 1934, \u00de\u00f3rbergur wrote a series of essays for the socialist daily Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ubla\u00f0i\u00f0, titled \"The Nazis' Sadistic Appetite\" (\"Kvala\u00feorsti nazista\"\u00de\u00f3rbergur \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, \u201eKvala\u00feorsti nazista.\u201c \u00ed Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ubla\u00f0inu, 6. jan. 1934, bls. 2.). Iceland's public prosecutor filed charges against \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson for supposedly offensive clauses in the article, one of which labelled Adolf Hitler \"a sadist\". The Supreme Court of Iceland agreed with the prosecutor and found the author guilty of \"derogating a foreign nation\". The court sentenced \u00de\u00f3rbergur to pay a fine of 200 kr\u00f3nur.\u201e\u00c6ra Hitlers metin \u00e1 200 kr\u00f3nur\u201c, grein \u00ed Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ubla\u00f0inu, 103. tbl, 1. \u00e1g\u00fast 1997, bls. 8. == English translations == The relatively little of \u00de\u00f3rbergur's work which has been translated into English consists mainly of fragments from his larger works. Portions of \u00cdslenzkur a\u00f0all (1938) were published as In Search of My Beloved in 1967. In recent years, Professor Julian Meldon D'arcy has translated a fragment from Br\u00e9f til L\u00e1ru (1924) as a short story, titled \"When I got pregnant\", as well as the first full book to appear in English translation: The Stones Speak (2012), \u00de\u00f3rbergur's childhood memoirs, originally published as Steinarnir tala in 1956. ==Bibliography== * 1915: H\u00e1lfir sk\u00f3s\u00f3lar * 1917: Spaks manns spjarir * 1922: Hv\u00edtir hrafnar (reprint of \"H\u00e1lfir sk\u00f3s\u00f3lar\" and \"Spaks manns spjarir\") * 1924: Br\u00e9f til L\u00e1ru * 1938: \u00cdslenzkur a\u00f0all (Portions published in English as In Search of My Beloved by Twayne Publishers, 1967) * 1940\u20131941: Ofvitinn * 1945\u20131950: \u00c6visaga \u00c1rna \u00de\u00f3rarinssonar pr\u00f3fasts, (memoirs of \u00c1rni \u00de\u00f3rarinsson) * 1954\u20131955: S\u00e1lmurinn um bl\u00f3mi\u00f0 * 1956: Steinarnir tala (Published in English as The Stones Speak by M\u00e1l og menning, Reykjav\u00edk 2012) * 1960: Ritger\u00f0ir 1924\u20131959 (essays) * 1975: \u00cd Su\u00f0ursveit * 2010: In the Footsteps of a Storyteller (excerpts accompanied by photographs, Forlagi\u00f0 2010) ==Museum== \u00de\u00f3rbergssetur museum and cultural centre in Hali, Su\u00f0ursveit On 30 June 2006, \u00de\u00f3rbergssetur, a museum and cultural center in Hali, Su\u00f0ursveit, Iceland devoted to \u00de\u00f3rbergur's work, was inaugurated. ==Notes== ==References== * \u00cdslenska Alfr\u00e6\u00f0ior\u00f0ab\u00f3kin P-\u00d6. 1990.
