    "text": "The 1980 Toronto municipal election was held on November 10, 1980 in Metropolitan Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Mayors, controllers, city councillors and school board trustees were elected in the municipalities of Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke and Scarborough. Art Eggleton narrowly defeated incumbent John Sewell to become Mayor of Toronto, and Mel Lastman was re-elected as Mayor of North York. ==Toronto== ===Mayoral race=== In the 1978 election reform candidate John Sewell had won against two more conservative candidates. In 1980 election the right united around Art Eggleton, and he narrowly defeated Sewell. Eggleton carried eight of the city's eleven wards, dominating in the west end, and prevailing in North Toronto and the east end by narrower margins. While Sewell increased his vote in every ward, he only carried three wards in the heart of the city: midtown's ward 5 (which included the city's Annex district), the downtown core (ward 6) and ward 7, which he had previously represented as an alderman.John Sewell, How We Changed Toronto: The Inside Story of Twelve Creative, Tumultuous Years in Civic Life Toronto: Lorimer, 2015 ;Results :Art Eggleton - 87,919 :John Sewell - 86,152 :Anne McBride - 3,429 :Bob Bush - 2,141 :Fred Dunn - 1,100 :Armand Siksna - 867 :Ronald Rodgers - 846 :Chris Faiers - 590 :Andrejs Murnieks - 571 ===City council=== Ward boundaries used in the 1980 election City council saw a handful of major upsets and was considered to have been moved to the right by the election as in addition to losing the mayoralty reformers lost their majority on council. The most notable upset was in the downtown Ward 6. Incumbent Allan Sparrow had stepped aside to allow George Hislop to run, in the belief that the large gay community in the ward deserved a representative on council. Hislop was one of the leading gay rights activists in the city, and his campaign was vigorously opposed by figures such as evangelist Ken Campbell. In a surprise upset Hislop lost to little known local dentist Gordon Chong. Elsewhere the left won important victories. Tom Wardle Jr., who had been involved in several controversies including an assault conviction, was defeated by former councillor Dorothy Thomas. After four failed attempts Joe Pantalone won a seat on council by capturing the one vacated by Eggleton. Top two from each ward elected to Toronto City Council. Top one from each ward also wins a seat on Metro Toronto council. ;Ward 1 (Swansea and Bloor West Village) :William Boytchuk (incumbent) - 9,415 :David White (incumbent) - 8,345 :Bill Roberts - 5,785 :Brynne Teal - 4,267 :Nick Gulycz - 1,143 :Yvette Tessier - 742 :Michael Horner - 636 ;Ward 2 (Parkdale and Brockton) :Tony Ruprecht (incumbent) - 9,447 :Ben Grys - 4,923 :Susan Atkinson - 4,907 :Elaine Ziemba - 4,137 :Elaine Taylor - 684 :John Lauter - 620 ;Ward 3 (Davenport and Corso Italia) :Joseph Piccininni (incumbent) - 7,509 :Richard Gilbert (incumbent) - 7,363 :Edward Gardner - 1,246 :Mark Llewellyn - 689 ;Ward 4 (Trinity-Bellwoods and Little Italy) :Tony O'Donohue (incumbent) - 5,005 :Joe Pantalone - 3,898 :Tony Ianno - 3,362 :Bill Moniz - 2,898 :Barbara Hurd - 2,279 :Nick Figliano - 704 :Anthony Russo - 206 ;Ward 5 (The Annex and Yorkville) ;Ward 6 (Financial District, Toronto - University of Toronto) :Gordon Chong - 9,522 :Dan Heap (incumbent) - 9,341 :George Hislop - 7,348 :Rose Smith - 2,959 :Fred Chappell - 1,339 :Darryl Randall - 659 :Gary Weagle - 505 ;Ward 7 (Regent Park and Riverdale) :Gordon Cressy (incumbent) - 12,579 :David Reville - 9,066 :Frank Dwyer - 3,748 :Thelma Forsyth - 2,632 ;Ward 8 (Riverdale) :Fred Beavis (incumbent) - 9,172 :Thomas Clifford (incumbent) - 7,941 :Jeanne McGuire - 1,433 :James McMillan - 1,264 :John Coutts - 550 ;Ward 9 (The Beaches) :Pat Sheppard (incumbent) - 10,236 :Dorothy Thomas - 7,886 :John Oliver - 6,102 :Bob Yaccato - 5,321 :Tom Wardle Jr. (incumbent) - 3,206 :Winona Gallop - 915 ;Ward 10 (Rosedale and North Toronto) :June Rowlands (incumbent) - 17,551 :Andrew Paton (incumbent) - 15,201 :Patricia Bolton - 2,678 :Craig Roberts - 2,367 ;Ward 11 (Forest Hill and North Toronto) :Anne Johnston (incumbent) - 15,168 :Michael Gee (incumbent) - 13,410 :Kay Gardner - 6,700 :Susan Diamond - 1,447 Results are taken from the November 11, 1980 Toronto Star and might not exactly match final tallies. ==By-elections== Ward 2 Alderman Tony Ruprecht resigned to contest the 1981 provincial election.
