    "text": "Charles Spedding (born 19 May 1952 in Bishop Auckland, County Durham) is a male English former long-distance runner. ==Athletics career== Spedding was fourth in the 10,000 metres representing England, at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. and was England\u2019s Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) 10,000 m champion in 1983 in a time of 28:08.12. His first marathon was the Houston Marathon in 1984, which he won by \"the thickness of a vest\". Spedding followed this by winning the London Marathon in 1984 and the bronze medal for Great Britain in the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, United States, finishing just 2 seconds behind silver medallist John Treacy. Although it was the first British Olympic marathon medal for 20 years, and the last won by Britain (male or female), the performance was one of 16 British medals in athletics that year, and it possibly did not get the recognition it deserved. In 1985 he set a PB and English Marathon record of 2:08.33 (which stood until 2014) when he finished second behind Steve Jones in the London Marathon. He is the third fastest British marathon runner after Jones and Mo Farah. He represented England in the marathon event, at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1987, he finished 8th in the London Marathon in 2:10.32. He also competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, finishing 6th. ==Post athletics== Spedding is a pharmacist by trade. In September 2009, he published an autobiography of his running career called From Last to First. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Sunderland in 2012.Nicola Weatherall, \"Sunderland University to honour Eddie Izzard, Charlie Spedding and Alastair Stewart\", The Journal, 5 July 2012 In November 2019 he published a book Stop Feeding Us Lies: How Health and Happiness Come to Those Who Seek the Truth which examines dietary recommendations and lifestyle approaches which he analyses as being causes of high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other illnesses. ==Achievements== {| |- !colspan=\"7\"|Representing |- |rowspan=3|1984 |Houston Marathon |Houston, United States |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |Marathon |2:11:54 |- |London Marathon |London, United Kingdom |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |Marathon |2:09:57 |- |Olympic Games |Los Angeles, United States |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |Marathon |2:09:58 |- |1985 |London Marathon |London, United Kingdom |bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd |Marathon |2:08:33 |- |1986 |Chicago Marathon |Chicago, United States |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |Marathon |2:10:13 |- |1987 |London Marathon |London, United Kingdom |8th |Marathon |2:10:32 |- |rowspan=2|1988 |London Marathon |London, United Kingdom |10th |Marathon |2:12:28 |- |Olympic Games |Seoul, South Korea |6th |Marathon |2:12:19 |} == References == ==External links== * Charlie Spedding: We're running out of time for legacy in the Independent * Article from 2003 in the Evening Chronicle * From Last to First * Power of 10 UK Men's Marathon Rankings * Power of 10 Profile: Charlie Spedding Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bishop Auckland Category:English male marathon runners Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for England Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1982 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1986 Commonwealth Games Category:London Marathon male winners Category:People educated at Durham School Category:Alumni of the University of Sunderland Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics ",
