    "text": "\"Shine\" was the first single to be released from Shannon Noll's second album, Lift. It was released in Australia on 26 September 2005, and debuted at number one on the Australian Singles Chart. \"Shine\" was the number one most added song to radio upon release, eventually going on to spend eleven consecutive weeks at number one on the Australian Airplay Chart - a record that still remains today. The track was seen as a real departure from the country-tinged rock and balladry of Noll's debut album. Written by Canadian songwriter Andy Stochansky, who also recorded the song for inclusion on one of his albums, \"Shine\" not only ruled radio airwaves in 2005, but also found itself in the Top 10 most played songs of the following year also. \"Shine\" was released as a single in the UK in April 2009, coinciding with Shannon's run in the stage version of Jeff Wayne's War Of The Worlds. ==Track listing== # \"Shine\" # \"What Love Is\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2005/06) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Trivia== *The song holds the record for most weeks at number one on the Australian Airplay Chart *\"Shine\" was the official theme tune for Cricket on Five from 2006 to 2010. *\"Shine\" was nominated for the Highest Selling Single award at the 2006 ARIA Awards, held October 2006 *The song was played when the Socceroos defeated Uruguay in the FIFA World Cup 2006 qualification playoff in Sydney when the team was celebrating on a stage in the middle of the park *It was also featured in the comedy National Lampoon's Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj *It was performed at the opening of the 2006 'School Spectacular' in Sydney, Australia. ==External links== * Category:2005 singles Category:Shannon Noll songs Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Songs written by Andy Stochansky Category:Songs written by Matthew Gerrard Category:2005 songs Category:Sony BMG singles ",
