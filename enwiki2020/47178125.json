    "text": "Lawrence Allen Zalcman (born 9 June 1943) is professor emeritus of Mathematics at Bar-Ilan University. His research concerns Complex analysis and potential theory, and their relations with approximation theory, harmonic analysis, integral geometry and partial differential equations.Prof. Lawrence Zalcman On top of his scientific achievements, Zalcman received numerous awards for mathematical exposition, including the Chauvenet Prize in 1976, the Lester R. Ford Award in 1975 and 1981, and the Paul R. Halmos \u2013 Lester R. Ford Award in 2017. Zalcman received his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968 under the supervision of Kenneth Myron Hoffman. In 1961, Zalcman graduated from Southwest High School in Kansas City, Missouri. In the theory of normal families, Zalcman's Lemma, which he used as part of his treatment of Bloch's principle, is named after him. Other eponymous honors are Zalcman domains, which play a role in the classification of Riemann surfaces, and Zalcman functions in complex dynamics. In the theory of partial differential equations, the Pizzetti-Zalcman formula is named after him. In 2012, Zalcman became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society ==Selected publications== * * with Peter Lax: Complex proofs of real theorems, American Mathematical Society 2012 ==References== Category:Israeli mathematicians Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Living people Category:Bar-Ilan University faculty Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:1943 births Category:Complex analysts ",
