    "text": "James Anthony Dorgan (26 November 1930 \u2013 30 January 2003) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the VFL during the 1950s. Dorgan played in the back pocket and had his best season in 1956 where he won South Melbourne's Best and Fairest award as well as finishing 3rd in the Brownlow Medal. For many years, Dorgan was officially credited with playing three games for Melbourne in 1949, but in 2018 these were correctly re- assigned to his brother Jack Dorgan. A third brother, Frank, was a premiership winning coach of the Williamstown Rovers. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1930 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Williamstown Football Club players Category:Bob Skilton Medal winners Category:2003 deaths ",
