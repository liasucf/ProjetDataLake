Be\u015fikta\u015f won their fifth national championship title by winning the Final Group in Bal\u0131kesir. The champions of the three major regional leagues (Istanbul, Ankara, and \u0130zmir) qualified directly for the Final Group. Adana Demirspor qualified by winning the qualification play-off, which was contested by the winners of the regional qualification groups. When Turkish football became officially professional in 24 September 1951, the competition continued under the name Turkish Amateur Football Championship, with only amateur teams participating. However, from that year on it was no longer the first tier football championship in Turkey. ==Qualification play-off== ===First Round=== ===Semi-finals=== ===Final=== ==Final group== ==References== ==External links== *RSSSF Category:Turkish Football Championship seasons Turkish Turkey ",
