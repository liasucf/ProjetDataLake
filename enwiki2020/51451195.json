Kingmaker is the first album without keyboard player Morten Sandager who left the band in February 2016 after joining Pretty Maids in 2006.Pretty Maids - PRETTY MAIDS ANNOUNCEMENT !! Instead Kim Olesen of Anubis Gate plays keyboards on the album.Pretty Maids In an interview with The Classic Metal Show, lead singer Ronnie Atkins said of the album: \"Basically we are big pop freaks as well. We like all kinds of music and to us a good song is a good song. Some of the stuff is actually written on an acoustic guitar. There are songs on the album that are basically pop songs. You could take songs like \"Heavens Little Devil\", basically just a pop song. The challenge is turning a pop song into a rock song.\"https://www.spreaker.com/user/cmsrocks/interview-with-pretty-maids- vocalist-ron The album debuted at number 35 on the German Albums Chart, becoming Pretty Maids' highest-charting album since Jump the Gun in 1990 (which also charted at number 35). However, the album failed to chart in their native Denmark. Danish music magazine Gaffa rated the album four out of five stars and wrote: \"Kingmaker is thus the third album in a row, where there is a vast majority of hits compared to misses.\"http://gaffa.dk/anmeldelse/114663 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Ronnie Atkins \u2013 vocals, writer *Ken Hammer \u2013 guitar, writer *Ren\u00e9 Shades \u2013 bass, bass and guitar solos engineering *Allan Tschicaja \u2013 drums *Kim Olesen \u2013 keyboards *Jacob Hansen \u2013 producer, engineer, mixer, mastering *Chris Laney \u2013 additional guitar solos engineering *Janne Stark \u2013 additional guitar solos engineering *Jonas Haagensen \u2013 assistant engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Pretty Maids albums Category:Frontiers Records albums ",
