It is now located in the municipality of Reimerswaal, about 10 km southwest of Bergen op Zoom. Bath has a population of about 90. According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, the former village of Bath was hit by floods several times in the 16th century: in 1530, 1532, 1536 and 1539. After these floods, only the church tower of the village was left, but it too had disappeared by the 19th century. In 1773, a part of the area was reclaimed from the sea again, and a fort, Fort Bath, was built to protect the ships who collected the toll for passing ships. A small hamlet was built inside the fort; this became the new village of Bath. Bath was a separate municipality until 1878 (called \"Fort Bath\" until 1816), when it became a part of the municipality of Rilland-Bath.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\", KNAW, 2006. ==Transportation== * Railway station: Rilland-Bath ==References== ==External links== * Map of the former municipality in 1868.
