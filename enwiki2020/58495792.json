The name \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 is not attested, but originates indirectly from minted coins dated to 4th century BCE bearing the legend \u00ab\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0395\u0391\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u00bb (considered a demonym). Several scholars have made a few suggestions about the community's location, or have connected it with other existing ancient towns of the area. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Thessalian city-states Category:Lost ancient cities and towns Category:Ancient Magnesia Category:Pelasgiotis ",
