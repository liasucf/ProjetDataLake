See: was the High Priest in the Second Temple in Jerusalem from 37 to 41 CE according to Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews.Josephus, Antiquities xix.vi.\u00a7 2 He was a member of one of the wealthiest and most influential Jewish families in Iudaea Province during the 1st century. A growing but still uncommon beliefThe earliest known person to suggest that most excellent Theophilus was none other than the High Priest was probably Theodore Hase who contributed a short article to Bibliotheca Bremensissome time prior to 1802 when this contribution is mentioned in the Introduction to the New Testament, tr. and augmented with notes by Johann David Michaelis and Herbert Marsh.

O'Toole, \"Theophilus,\" Anchor Bible Dictionary 6:511-512 Theophilus was the son of Ananus () and the brother of Eleazar, Jonathan, Matthias and Ananus, all of whom served as High Priests. He was also the brother-in-law of Joseph Caiaphas, the High Priest before whom Jesus of Nazareth appeared. In addition, his son Matthias served as the next to the last High Priest before the destruction of the Temple by the Romans. Archeological evidence confirming the existence of Theophilus, as an ossuary has been discovered bearing the inscription, \"Yeho\u1e25anah (Johanna) daughter of Yeho\u1e25anan (Jonathan) son of Thefilus (Theophilus) the High Priest\".D. Barag and D. Flusser, \"The Ossuary of Yehohanah Granddaughter of the High Priest Theophilus\", Israel Exploration Journal, 36 (1986), 39-44. The details of this ossuary have been published in the Israel Exploration Journal. Therefore, Theophilus had at least one other son named Jonathan, father to Johanna. The name Johanna appears twice in the New Testament in the Gospel of Luke. First as one of women healed by Jesus who travels with Jesus and the disciples to Jerusalem. Her second appearance also in the Gospel of Luke is on Easter Sunday when she and other women visits the empty tomb. It is uncertain, however, whether the Johanna in the Gospel of Luke is the same Johanna as the one mentioned on the ossuary. According to Richard Bauckham, Johanna was \"the fifth most popular woman's name in Jewish Palestine,\"Richard Bauckham, Gospel Women: Studies of the Named Women in the Gospels (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2002), 143 and the Johanna of the Gospel of Luke was likely from Galilee, not from Jerusalem.Richard Bauckham, Gospel Women: Studies of the Named Women in the Gospels (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2002), 144. ==See also== * Theophilus (biblical) ==Notes== ==References== * This article is a summary of an article appearing in Dossiers d'Archeologie as \"A la recherche de Theophile\", December 2 \u2013 January 3; A detailed description of the ossuary mentioned in this article is contained in an article by D.
