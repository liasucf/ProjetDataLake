The station leases virtually all of its programming to MCTV - My Christian Television, a Christian ministry programmer. It can also be viewed on WJYS subchannel 62-10. WEDE-CD's beginnings were as a translator station on channel 17 since its inception in 1989. It moved to channel 34 in 1998 and the call letters were rechristened as translator W34CK. The station received class A low power status with their new call letters as WEDE-CA in 2005. Channel 34 was once an affiliate of Family Net while also airing some religious programming and infomercials. Around 2008 its programming began to be additionally viewed on WJYS' subchannel 62-2. After the full-power digital transition in June 2009, WEDE-CA began to receive increased signal coverage from its transmitter at Willis Tower since as a low power station it was not affected by the digital switchover. In summer of 2014 WEDE-CA extinguished their analog signal on channel 34 and flash cut to digital as WEDE-CD. It currently reaches about 8 million people in the Chicago market and continues to serve its surrounding areas as MCTV - Chicago's 24-hour Christian station. ==External links== * Station's Official Website * Category:Television stations in Illinois Category:Television channels and stations established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Illinois Category:Digital low-power television stations ",
