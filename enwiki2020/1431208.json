    "text": "Daniel Edward Murtaugh (October 8, 1917 \u2013 December 2, 1976) was an American second baseman, manager, front-office executive, and coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). Murtaugh Is best known for his 29-year association with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he won two World Series as field manager (in and ). He also played 416 of his 767 career MLB games with the Pirates as their second baseman. ==Life and career== ===As player=== Murtaugh appeared in all or parts of nine big-league seasons, initially for the Philadelphia Phillies (1941\u201343, 1946) and Boston Braves (1947) before joining the Pirates (1948\u201351). He threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . Murtaugh's 1949 Bowman Gum baseball card A native of Chester, Pennsylvania, Murtaugh was working with his father at Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. after he graduated from Chester High School when he took a pay cut to start his professional baseball career at age 19 in 1937. After signing with the St. Louis Cardinals, he joined the Redbirds' extensive farm system, initially as a member of the Cambridge (Maryland) Cardinals of the Class D Eastern Shore League. In June 1941, in the midst of Murtaugh's second consecutive stellar season with the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League, the Phillies purchased his contract; he then made his MLB debut on July 3 as a defensive replacement for Hal Marnie against Boston at Braves Field.Retrosheet box score: 1941-07-03 The following day he started both ends of a July 4 doubleheader and essentially took over as the Phils' regular second baseman. As a rookie, Murtaugh led the National League in stolen bases with 18, even though he played only 85 games after his acquisition from Houston in late June. In 1942\u201343 he got into 257 games before joining the United States Army in August 1943 for World War II service. He declined the opportunity to play baseball in the United States and served in combat with the 97th Infantry in Germany. Returning to baseball in , he played in only six games for Philadelphia before he was sold back to the Cardinals' organization. At Triple-A Rochester, Murtaugh hit .322 and his 174 hits were tied for first in the International League. The Braves then selected him in the 1946 Rule 5 draft, but Murtaugh played in only three early-season games for them before he was again sent to Triple-A. At 29, he had another good offensive season, hitting .302 for Milwaukee. Although his performance did not earn Murtaugh a return to the Braves, it led to perhaps his biggest break when, on November 18, Boston included him in a five-player trade to the Pirates, where he spent the rest of his big-league career. His most productive season came in his first year with the Bucs, , when he hit .290 and posted career highs in hits (149), runs batted in (71), runs scored (56), doubles (21), triples (5) and games played (146). He started a career-high 145 games as the Pirates' second baseman. After a poor , Murtaugh rebounded by hitting a personal-best .294 in . Overall, Murtaugh was a .254 career lifetime batter with 661 hits, eight home runs and 219 RBI in 767 games. ===As manager=== After retiring as a player, Murtaugh managed the New Orleans Pelicans (1952\u201354), the Pirates' Double-A farm club, and the unaffiliated Triple-A Charleston Senators (April 19 through July 16, 1955). In 1956 he returned to the Pirates as a coach under Bobby Bragan. In his second year in the job, on August 4, 1957, he succeeded Bragan as skipper with the Bucs 36\u201367 and one game out of last place; under Murtaugh, they perked up to win 26 of their final 51 games. In his first full season, , Murtaugh led the Pirates to a surprise second-place finish in the National League. He went on to hold the Pittsburgh job for all or parts of 15 seasons over four different terms (1957\u201364, 1967, 1970\u201371, 1973\u201376). In his third full season as manager, Murtaugh guided the Bucs to the first of the two World Series championships they won under his command. After they won the National League pennant by seven full games over the Braves, they stunned the heavy-hitting New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series\u2014won in Pittsburgh's last at bat by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run in the ninth inning of Game 7. The Yankees outscored Pittsburgh 55\u201327, and administered three thrashings (16\u20133, 10\u20130 and 12\u20130), but the resilient Pirates took the other four contests by a run differential of only +7 (6\u20134, 3\u20132, 5\u20132 and 10\u20139). Murtaugh, circa 1964 From 1961\u201364, his Pirates had only one over-.500 season and, after the conclusion of the campaign, Murtaugh stepped down as manager just before his 47th birthday. He had been battling health problems, sometimes reported as a heart ailment. He moved up to the Pirate front office as a key assistant in charge of evaluating players for general manager Joe L. Brown. After the 1965 season, he turned down feelers from the Boston Red Sox to join their organization as vice president, player personnel. Then, in , when his immediate successor as the Pirates' manager, Harry Walker, was fired July 17, Murtaugh returned as interim pilot for the remainder of the 1967 season, after which he returned to the front office. Well aware of the abundance of talent in the Pittsburgh system, Murtaugh asked to reclaim the managing job after Larry Shepard was fired in the last week of the season. Once medically cleared, he became skipper of the Pirates once again. (Only hours after this re-hiring on October 9, Don Hoak, his third baseman on the 1960 World Series champion Pirates and a manager in the Pirates' farm system in 1969, died of a heart attack after believing he was a leading contender to manage the parent club.) His first two clubs won the 1970\u201371 National League East Division titles. Although the squad fell in that season's National League Championship Series to the Cincinnati Reds, Murtaugh's 1971 Pirates defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS and then captured the 1971 World Series with a memorable comeback from a two- games-to-none deficit against the favored Baltimore Orioles. That World Series was marked by the brilliant performance of future Baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, who batted .414 with 12 hits to lead his team to the championship. Citing renewed health concerns (he had been hospitalized for chest pain during the 1971 season), Murtaugh again resigned as manager after the world title. He moved back into the Pittsburgh front office, and his hand- picked successor, Bill Virdon (center fielder for his 1960 champions), took over for the 1972 campaign. When Brown fired Virdon on September 5 of , Murtaugh reluctantly returned to managing and stayed through the season, winning NL East titles in and but falling to the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Reds in the NLCS in successive years. After a second-place finish in , both Murtaugh and Brown announced their retirements during the final week of the season. Just two months after his retirement, Murtaugh died in Chester from a stroke at age 59. The number 40 he wore as the Bucs' manager was retired by the Pirates on April 7, 1977. As a manager, he compiled a 1,115\u2013950 record in 2,068 games (.540), second in Pirates history behind only Fred Clarke. In addition to his two National League pennants and world championships, he won four Eastern Division titles (1970\u201371, 1974\u201375). On September 1, 1971, Murtaugh was the first manager in major league history to field a starting lineup consisting of nine black players (African Americans and Afro-Latin Americans). The Pirates beat the Phillies 10\u20137 in that game. ==Managerial record== {| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Team ! rowspan=\"2\"| From ! rowspan=\"2\"| To ! colspan=\"3\"| Regular season record ! colspan=\"3\"| Post\u2013season record |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | rowspan=\"4\"| Pittsburgh Pirates | 1957 | 1964 | | |- | 1967 | 1967 | | |- | 1970 | 1971 | | |- | 1973 | 1976 | | |- ! colspan=\"3\"| Total ! ! |- ! colspan=\"9\"| Reference: |} == Highlights == * Led NL in stolen bases (1941) * Led NL second basemen in putouts, assists and double plays (1948) * Finished 9th in the NL MVP selection (1948) * Selected \"Man of the Year\" by Sport magazine (1960) * Twice received The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award (1960, 1970) * Three-time Dapper Dan Award-winner (1958, 1970, 1971) * One of only 36 managers in major league history to win 1,000 or more games == See also == * List of Major League Baseball retired numbers * List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders * List of Major League Baseball managers by wins * Tim Murtaugh == References == * \"Baseball Pays Its Respects to Murtaugh at Funeral\", The New York Times, Dec. 7, 1976. **\"A great manager, a great man\" Hroncich, Colleen, Columbia, (KofC, New Haven, CT, July 2016) == External links == *Danny Murtaugh at Baseball Almanac * Baseball Hall of Fame \u2013 2008 Veterans Committee candidate profile * *Danny Murtaugh photo tribute at Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (commemorating 50th anniversary of 1960 Bucs' World Series victory over the Yankees) * Andy Sturgill, Danny Murtaugh.
