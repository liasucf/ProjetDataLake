    "text": "The Battle of Labrytai () was a battle around 380 BC that occurred nearly directly after Oktamasades usurped the Sindian throne from his father Hekataios and attacked and took the city of Labrytai, presumably a city under Bosporan rule. Leukon, the ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom, had made war upon Oktamasades on behalf of Hekataios, who was a vassal of the Bosporans prior to his removal from the throne. ==Prelude== Hekataios had suffered a war against his former wife Tirgatao after marrying the wife of Satyros I and casting out Tirgatao to a tower. Tirgatao had escaped and rallied her tribe of Ixomatae and laid fire and sword to both the lands of Hekataios and those of Satyros. This made the two seek for peace, Tirgatao giving it to them after negotiations, with Metrodoros, a son of Satyros, being sent as a hostage. Satyros then back stabbed Tirgatao in an assassination attempt, but failed and lost his son Metrodoros in the process. Peace was made when Gorgippos, one Satyros's sons who became a co-king of Leukon, upon his ascension to the throne. Oktamasades may have been a son of Tirgitao, and therefore usurped the throne from his father presumably shortly after the war had ended with his mother and her tribe. His rebellion must've required some sort of backing from the at least a part of aristocracy in the Sindike Kingdom. ==Battle== Oktamasades had taken the city before the battle, prompting Leukon to involve himself due to an attack on a Bosporan city. Leukon likely saw this as an opportunity to add the Sindike Kingdom to his possessions, and waged war. Leukon, before the battle, had made a vow to erect a monument not to the Apollo the Labyreans worshipped, but Apollo, the god the Spartocids worshipped the most. Upon battling Oktamasades, Leukon quickly routed his army, and forced him to flee to Scythia, leaving behind the throne for his father to re- take. ==Aftermath== Leukon upon gaining victory, made good on his vow and erected a statue to Phoebus Apollo at Labrytai. It is unknown whether Hekataios renounced his power to Leukon, or died while Leukon fought Oktamasades. The Sindike Kingdom had been made a province of the Bosporan Kingdom shortly after the battle, suggesting that Leukon became ruler of the land shortly after gaining victory. ==References== Category:Wars of the Bosporan Kingdom Category:380 Conflicts ",
