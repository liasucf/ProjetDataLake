    "text": "Anna Tarr\u00e9s Camp\u00e0 (born 19 October 1967) is a synchronized swimming coach and former national synchronized swimmer from Spain. She competed in the women's duet at the 1984 Summer Olympics. After retiring from competition Tarr\u00e9s began coaching at her swimming club, CN Kallipolis, in 1987, where she coached Gemma Mengual to international success. In 1997 she was appointed as head coach of the Spanish national synchronised swimming team: during her time in charge the team enjoyed great success, taking four Olympic medals, 26 World Championship medals, and 25 European Championship medals, however in September 2012 the Royal Spanish Swimming Federation informed her that her contract would not be extended beyond the end of the year. Shortly afterwards 15 former members of the team issued a public letter criticising Tarr\u00e9s for using authoritarian and demeaning behaviour in her role as head coach, although Mengual and national team captain Andrea Fuentes both spoke in Tarr\u00e9s' defence, and Fuentes subsequently announced her retirement from elite competition in January 2013 due to demotivation as a result of the conflict between Tarr\u00e9s and the federation. After leaving the Spanish national team Tarr\u00e9s was appointed as one of the coaches of the Ukrainian national team in 2015. She was elected deputy in the Parliament of Catalonia in the 21 December 2017 Catalan regional elections. == References == Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish synchronized swimmers Category:Olympic synchronized swimmers of Spain Category:Synchronized swimmers at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Spanish swimming coaches Category:Spanish women in politics Category:Members of the 12th Parliament of Catalonia Category:21st-century Spanish women politicians Category:Members of the Parliament of Catalonia Category:Catalan politicians Category:Catalan women in politics Category:People from Barcelona Category:Synchronized swimming coaches ",
