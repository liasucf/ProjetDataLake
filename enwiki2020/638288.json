    "text": "The Renault Kangoo and the Renault Kangoo Express are a range of multi purpose vehicles manufactured and marketed by Renault across two generations since 1997 in commercial as well as passenger variants. , the electric variant, the Renault Kangoo Z.E., is Europe's top selling all-electric light commercial vehicle, with global sales of 48,821 units since its inception in 2011. The Kangoo is manufactured at the MCA plant in Maubeuge, France and Casablanca, Morocco. The version for the ASEAN markets was assembled by the Malaysian Tan Chong Euro Cars in its Segambut plant. The first generation model was marketed as a rebadged variant by Nissan in Europe as the Nissan Kubistar until the end of 2009, in other Spanish-parlant countries has retained his original designation, when it was replaced by the Nissan NV200. In September 2012, Mercedes-Benz began marketing a rebadged variant of the second generation Kangoo as the Mercedes-Benz Citan. __TOC__ == First generation (KC/KW; 1997) == The first generation Kangoo was introduced in October 1997, and was facelifted in March 2003, with new front end nose styling, especially the grille, standardised across the Renault range, with the Renault diamond mounted on a body colour panel in the centre of the grille and teardrop headlamps. The rear windows and seats of the Kangoo could be removed, producing the panel van Kangoo Express. The Kangoo became popular with mobility impaired and wheelchair users due to its height and accessibility, and because it could be adapted to include mounting points for wheelchairs. The rear of the vehicle is cut to allow a ramp to be fitted. A pair of front tie downs are fitted (retractable seat belts with a solonoid release to allow them to be extended, passed around the wheelchair frame, and then locked back when the solonoid is switched off and they retract); this stops the wheelchair from moving back. A pair of rear tie downs with the normal clamping buckles stop the wheelchair from moving forward. A normal, long seat belt is worn by the wheelchair user. Both the Kangoo and Kangoo Express were available in four-wheel drive versions and a lengthened version was available, with an increased cargo area. A pickup version was sold in the Swedish market. In some countries, such as Malaysia, the Kangoo was assembled by Nissan with third row seats. A badge-engineered version of the Kangoo panel van was sold as the Nissan Kubistar, sold by Nissan from 1997 to 2009. From July 2003, Wallace and Gromit starred in adverts in the United Kingdom for the Kangoo. ===Break'Up=== The Kangoo Break'Up was a four wheel drive concept car announced in August 2002 and previewed the facelift design due in 2003, together with a pick up- style rear. It was powered by 1.6 L engine producing . ===Four wheel drive=== Nissan Kubistar Post facelift Renault Kangoo that is able to carry a wheelchair Renault Kangoo Trekka The 4WD version of the Kangoo was introduced in 2002, and was marketed under the model name Trekka. It should not be confused with the Skoda powered New Zealand built utility vehicle named Trekka, which was marketed in the Antipodes for several years circa 1970. The Kangoo Trekka's all wheel drive system differed from the Renault Scenic RX4 in its inclusion of a Nissan sourced automatic torque coupling \"ATC\", a hydraulic coupling that would engage drive on all four wheels should the front wheels start to lose traction. This allowed the Kangoo Trekka to run in front wheel drive in most conditions, thus saving fuel. Working in combination with the ATC, the Kangoo Trekka featured an electronically controlled \"ASR\" traction control system which could brake the front wheels to arrest traction loss. The suspension on the front had longer front struts with revised coil springs, lower suspension arms were revised to a cast steel item. The rear suspension was completely revised from the standard Kangoo torsion bar suspension beam axle to a fully independent coil sprung system with wishbones. The rear differential was centrally mounted with two driveshafts transmitting power to the rear wheels. All this was carried on a subframe which increased the ground clearance and wheel travel. These changes gave the Kangoo Trekka a fording depth and 28 degree hill climbing capability. The Kangoo Trekka was marketed in the UK with a choice of two engines, the 1.6 L 16 valve petrol engine and the 1.9 L dCi common rail turbodiesel both with a five speed manual gearbox In 2005, these models were priced at \u00a312,600 and \u00a313,600 respectively. The diesel produced a peak torque of and achieved over on the combined (urban and extra urban) fuel consumption test. The petrol engine had a time of 14.3 seconds, and a combined fuel consumption of . The interior of the Kangoo Trekka was spartan. The rear bench seat could be folded forward to provide a loading area, with better access through the sliding side doors. ===Engines=== The Kangoo and Kangoo Express was/is available with a choice of multiple engines: * 1.0 L D Series petrol, (8v) / (16v) * 1.2 L D Series petrol, (8v) / (16v) * 1.4 L 8v Energy petrol, * 1.6 L 16v K Series petrol, * 1.5 L dCi turbodiesel, / / / / / / * 1.9 L F Series D diesel, / (normally aspirated, indirect injection) * 1.9 L F Series dTi turbodiesel, (direct injection) * 1.9 L F Series dCi turbodiesel, / * Electric Electri'cit\u00e9 (limited edition) * Plug In Hybrid Elect'road (limited edition) Some LPG and CNG variants of petrol engines have also been produced. ===Electric vehicles based on Kangoo I=== Cleanova II is a hybrid electric drive train system, used in a vehicle based on Renault Kangoo, with two electric versions: full electric vehicle (FEV) and plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV). == Second generation (FC/FW; 2007) == Kangoo Compact (Europe; pre facelift) The New Renault Kangoo and New Renault Kangoo Express are based on the Scenic and manufactured in Maubeuge.
