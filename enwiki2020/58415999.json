    "text": "Dmitry Leonidovich Gridin (born March 4, 1968 in Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast), known as \"The Lifter\", is a Soviet serial killer who killed three girls in 1989. == Biography == Little is known about Gridin's early life. It is known that he was born in a very respected in the city family. His father was the head of the workshop at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, and Gridin was a student at the Magnitogorsk State Technical University, was married, and had a six-month-old daughter. The first murder Gridin committed was on July 31, 1989, killing 16-year-old Zhana Terenchuk in the porch of her house. Then there were three unsuccessful attacks on girls, one of them giving a detailed description of the \"Lifter\". A month later he again committed two murders at once (Danzili Usmanova and Lyudmila Pozdnyakova). On the site of one of the murders he left a fingerprint. On November 25, 1989, Gridin tried to make another attack, but the girl gave him serious resistance, and he ran in fear, dropping his hat and glasses. It was because of these signs that he was soon detained, since it -20 \u00b0C on the street, and Gridin stood out too much from the crowd. In addition, at the time of his arrest a knife was taken away from him. The Gridin case caused a wide resonance in society. The people were furious and demanded the public execution of the murderer. The trial began in the fall of 1990 and was accompanied by popular unrest: people demanded that the criminal be sentenced to the most severe sentence. On October 3, 1990, the Chelyabinsk Regional Court sentenced Gridin to death; but in December 1993 the death penalty was replaced by life imprisonment, and he was imprisoned on Ognenny Ostrov in the Vologda Oblast. In 2000, Gridin appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which admitted that there were violations in his case. However, the Russian leadership refused to release him, citing the fact that after his arrest attacks on women ceased. In 2013, the crew of the TV program \"Investigation conducted...\" visited Dmitry Gridin in the colony in Vologda Oblast. In the interview, he announced his intention to apply for parole in 2014, 25 years after his arrest. In 2014, he tried to challenge the Presidential Decree on pardon, but the application was refused. Gridin challenged the refusal, but the Supreme Court of Russia left court ruling unchanged. In the same year, Gridin, after 25 years of imprisonment, filed a motion on the UDO, but the Belozersky District Court issued a decision to refuse parole. Three years later, in the summer of 2017, Gridin filed a motion for the second time, but the court again refused him, after which Gridin filed an appeal with the Vologoda Regional Court against the Belozersky Court's decision, but the appeal was rejected. Even after more than 28 years of imprisonment, Gridin has not admitted his guilt. ==See also== * List of Russian serial killers == References == == External links == * The last living maniac of the USSR.
