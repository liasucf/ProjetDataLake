    "text": "Phallus Dei () is the debut album by German band Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II. The album was the result of the Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl commune in Munich splitting. The album features layered guitars, abstract percussion, and chant-like vocals. It is often cited (alongside Can's Monster Movie) as the original Krautrock album. It was first issued on CD in 1988 by the Mantra label. All known copies list the songs in incorrect order on the cover, but present them correctly on the disc itself, except for the 1993 Repertoire Records re-issue. It was reissued in 2001, digitally remastered by Eroc, and contained two extra tracks: \"Freak Out Requiem (Parts I-IV)\" and \"Cymbals in the End\". The 2006 re-remastered reissue on the German label Revisited Records contains two bonus tracks: \"TouchMaPhal\" (10:17) and \"I Want the Sun to Shine\" (10:32). It does not contain the bonus material from the 2001 reissue. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II. ===Side one=== # \"Kanaan\" \u2013 4:02 # \"Dem Guten, Sch\u00f6nen, Wahren\" \u2013 6:12 # \"Luzifers Ghilom\" \u2013 8:34 # \"Henriette Kr\u00f6tenschwanz\" \u2013 2:03 ===Side two=== # \"Phallus Dei\" \u2013 20:48 ===Bonus tracks (2001)=== # \"Freak-Out Requiem I\" - 4:02 # \"Freak-Out Requiem II\" - 3:47 # \"Freak-Out Requiem III\" - 0:42 # \"Freak-Out Requiem IV\" - 7:49 # \"Cymbals in the End\" - 0:31 ===Bonus tracks (2006)=== # \"TouchMaPhal\" - 10:17 # \"I Want the Sun to Shine\" - 10:32 ==Personnel== * Shrat \u2013 bongos, vocals, violin * Peter Leopold \u2013 drums * Holger Tr\u00fclzsch \u2013 Turkish drums * Dieter Serfas \u2013 drums, electric cymbals * John Weinzierl \u2013 guitar, 12-string, bass * Falk Rogner \u2013 organ * Christian Borchard \u2013 vibraphone * Chris Karrer \u2013 violin, guitar, twelve-string guitar, soprano saxophone, vocals * Renate Knaup \u2013 vocals, tambourine * Dave Anderson \u2013 bass ===Credits=== * Gerd Stein \u2013 photography * Olaf K\u00fcbler \u2013 producer ==References== Category:1969 debut albums Category:Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II albums Category:German-language albums ",
