    "text": "William Moses Kunstler (July 7, 1919 \u2013 September 4, 1995) was an American lawyer and civil rights activist, known for defending the Chicago Seven. Kunstler was an active member of the National Lawyers Guild, a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the co-founder of the Law Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), the \"leading gathering place for radical lawyers in the country\". Kunstler's defense of the Chicago Seven from 1969 to 1970 led The New York Times to label him \"the country's most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer\". Kunstler is also well known for defending members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Catonsville Nine, Black Panther Party, Weather Underground Organization, the Attica Prison rioters, and the American Indian Movement. He also won a de facto segregation case regarding the District of Columbia's public schools and \"disinterred, singlehandedly\" the concept of federal criminal removal jurisdiction in the 1960s. Kunstler refused to defend right-wing groups such as the Minutemen, on the grounds that: \"I only defend those whose goals I share. I'm not a lawyer for hire. I only defend those I love.\" He was a polarizing figure; many on the right wished to see him disbarred, while many on the left admired him as a \"symbol of a certain kind of radical lawyer.\" Even some other civil rights lawyers regarded Kunstler as a \"publicity hound and a hit-and-run lawyer\" who \"brings cases on Page 1 and wins them on Page 68.\" Legal writer Sidney Zion quipped that Kunstler was \"one of the few lawyers in town who knows how to talk to the press. His stories always check out and he's not afraid to talk to you, and he's got credibility\u2014although you've got to ask sometimes, 'Bill, is it really true?'\" ==Early life== Kunstler was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Frances Mandelbaum and Monroe Bradford Kunstler, a physician. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School.Langum, David J. \"William M. Kunstler: the most hated lawyer in America\", p. 25. New York University Press, 1999. . \"Kunstler attended DeWitt Clinton High School at its annex on West End Avenue.\" He was educated at Yale College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1941, and Columbia University Law School from which he graduated in 1948. While in school, Kunstler was an avid poet and represented Yale in the Glascock Prize competition at Mount Holyoke College. Rejected twice by the US Navy, Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during World War II in the Pacific theater. He volunteered for cryptography and served in New Guinea.Langum, David J. William M. Kunstler: The Most Hated Lawyer in America, pp. 4\u20135, NYU Press, 2002 He rose to the rank of Major, and received the Bronze Star. While in the army, he was noted for his theatric portrayals in the Fort Monmouth Dramatic Association.Brooks Atkinson. 1941, December 21. \"Acting on the Camp Grounds\". The New York Times. p. X1. After his discharge from the Army he attended law school, was admitted to the bar in New York in 1948 and began practicing law. Kunstler went through R.H. Macy's executive training program in the late 1940s and practiced family and small business law in the 1950s, before entering civil rights litigation in the 1960s. He was an associate professor of law at New York Law School (1950\u20131951). Kunstler won honorable mention for the National Legal Aid Association's press award in 1957 for his series of radio broadcasts on WNEW, \"The Law on Trial\".Warren Weaver. 1957. \"Public Defender in State Opposed\". The New York Times. p. 53. At WNEW, Kunstler also conducted interviews on controversial topics, such as the Alger Hiss case, on a program called Counterpoint.Jack Gould.

Kunstler first made headlines in 1957 when he defended William Worthy, a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American, who was one of forty-two Americans who had their passports seized after violating the State Department's travel ban on Communist China (after attending a Communist youth conference in Moscow).Dana Adams Schmidt. 1957, September 19. \"U.S. Youths in China Will Lose Passports.\" The New York Times. p. 1.

Westin. 1961, October 14. \"Counsel for the Defense Was on Trial Too\". The New York Times. p. 283. At the time of the publication, Kunstler was already well known for his work with the Freedom Riders, his book on the Caryl Chessman case, and his radio coverage of trials.

The New York Times. p. 12.The New York Times. 1964, July 2. \"Writ Denied 3 Boys Indicted in Murder\". p. 26. Kunstler went to St. Augustine, Florida in 1964 during the demonstrations led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Robert B. Hayling which put added pressure on Congress to pass the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Kunstler brought the first federal case under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which allowed the removal of cases from county court to be appealed; the defendants were protestors at the 1964 New York World's Fair.Alfred E. Clark. 1964, August 27. \"U.S. Judge to Hear Rights Case Here\". The New York Times. p. 37. ===ACLU director (1964\u20131972)=== He was a director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) from 1964 to 1972, when he became a member of the ACLU National Council.

In 1965, Kunstler's firm Kunstler, Kunstler, and Kinoy was asked to defend Jack Ruby by his brother Earl, but dropped the case because they \"did not wish to be in a situation where we have to fight to get into the case\".Alfred E.

Another prosecution witness, photographer Louis Salzberg, admitted under Kunstler's cross-examination that he was still on the payroll of the FBI.John Kifner. 1969, October 24. \"F.B.I. Paid 'Friend' of the 'Chicago 8'\". New York Times. p. 28.

New York Times. p. 15. Kunstler also sparred with Judge Julius Hoffman, on one occasion remarking (with respect to the number of federal marshals): \"this courtroom has the appearance of an armed camp. I would note that the Supreme Court has ruled that the appearance of an armed camp is a reversible error\".Seth S. Kings. 1969, October 17. \"Chicago 8 Lawyer Sees A Conviction\".

New York Times. p. A1. Kunstler and co-defense attorneys Leonard Weinglass, Michael Kennedy, Gerald Lefcourt, Dennis Roberts and Michael Tigar were cited for contempt (the convictions were later overturned unanimously by the Seventh Circuit).

New York Times. p. E2. The progress of the trial\u2014which had many aspects of guerrilla theater\u2014was covered on the nightly news and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero.Victor S. Navasky. 1970, April 19. \"Right On! With Lawyer William Kunstler\". New York Times. p. 217. \"William Kunstler is without doubt the country's most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer period.\" available at https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/19/archives/right-on-with-lawyer- william-kunstler-without-doubt-comma-william.html. After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the conspiracy charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.John Kifner. 1970, December 4. \"Hoffman Recalls 2 Jury Messages\". New York Times. p. 35. The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972 due to Hoffman's refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on racial and cultural biases; the Justice Department did not retry the case. Shortly after the 1968 Democratic Convention, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Dave Dellinger and Robert Greenblatt received subpoenas to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Kunstler and co-counsel, Michael Kennedy, were among the group's six defense attorneys. On the opening day of the HUAC hearings, the subpoenaed men and their lawyers, including Kunstler and Kennedy, staged a \u201cstand-in\u201d to protest the investigations. \u201cThe Constitution is being raped and we as lawyers are being emasculated in an armed camp,\u201d Kennedy shouted at the hearing. ===American Indian Movement (1973\u20131976)=== Kunstler arrived in Pine Ridge, South Dakota on March 4, 1973 to draw up the demands of the American Indian Movement (AIM) members involved in the Wounded Knee incident.New York Times. 1973, March 5. \"Indians Get Offer on Ending Seizure\". p. 26.

The trial was moved to Minnesota.Martin Waldrons. 1974, January 27. \"Kunstler Works; Disbarment Effort Fails\". New York Times. p. 32. Two authors and three Sioux were called as defense witnesses, mostly focusing on the historical (and more recent) injustice against the Sioux on the part of the U.S. government, shocking the prosecution.Martin Waldrons. 1974, August 17. \"2 Indians Summon Only 5 Witnesses\". New York Times. p. 50.

New York Times. p. 41. Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of John Hill, Kunstler's client, and Charles Pernasilice (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained \"slight\" doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident.Mary Breasted. February 28, 1975. \"Attica Witness Has Some Doubts\". New York Times. p. 38. Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard.Michael T. Kaufman. April 6, 1975. \"Attica Jury Convicts One of Murder, 2d of Assault\". New York Times. p. 1.

New York Times. p. 66. Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one occasion Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member. The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault. When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges remanding them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them. New York Governor Hugh Carey granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill's name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending.Tom Goldstein. 1976, December 31. \"Governor Pardons 7 to 'Close the Book' on Attica Episode\". New York Times. p. 31.

In 1984 Shakur was granted asylum in Cuba by Fidel Castro , who called the charges \u201can infamous lie\". William Kunstler told reporters in 1979 that Shakur's health had declined in prison; he said: \u201cI was very happy that she escaped because I thought she was unfairly tried\".FBI places Assata Shakur on 'Most Wanted Terrorist' list ===Collaboration with Ron Kuby (1983\u20131995)=== At the time of Kunstler's death, he was defending Omar Abdel- Rahman (\"the Blind Sheik\") for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. From 1983 until Kunstler's death in 1995, Ron Kuby was his partner. The two took on controversial civil rights and criminal cases, including cases where they represented Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, head of the Egyptian-based terrorist group Gama'a al-Islamiyah, responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Colin Ferguson, the man responsible for the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, who would later reject Kuby & Kunstler's legal counsel and choose to represent himself at trial; Qubilah Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X, accused of plotting to murder Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam; Glenn Harris, a New York City public school teacher who absconded with a fifteen- year-old girl for two months; Nico Minardos, a flamboyant actor indicted by Rudy Giuliani for conspiracy to ship arms to Iran; Darrell Cabey, one of the persons shot by Bernard Goetz; and associates of the Gambino crime family.

B1. During the first Gulf War, they represented dozens of American soldiers who refused to fight and claimed conscientious objector status.

William M. Kunstler: the most hated lawyer in America, p. 275. New York University Press, 1999. . and \"I never made a nickel on an OC [organized crime] case.\"Hamill, Denis. 1988, July 27. \"A road map to the trial.\" Newsday. p. 7. The more notorious of Kunstler's mobster clients included Joe Bonanno, Raymond L.S. Patriarca, Nicholas L. Bianco, John Gotti, and Louis Ferrante, who claimed in his memoir, Unlocked: the Life and Crimes of a Mafia Insider, that \"he [Kunstler] took a hundred grand off me.\"Ferrante, Louis. \"Unlocked: the life and crimes of a mafia insider,\" p. 161. HarperCollins Publishers, 2009. . ==Other work== In 1979, Kunstler represented Marvin Barnes, an ABA and NBA basketball player, with past legal troubles and league discipline problems. In 1989\u20131990, Kunstler twice argued successfully in defense of flag burning, before the Supreme Court. In Texas v. Johnson and United States v. Eichman, the Court held the act to be protected speech under the First Amendment, striking down Texas state and Federal statutes on \"flag desecration\". Kunstler appeared as a lawyer in the movie The Doors in 1991, as a judge in the movie Malcolm X in 1992, and as himself in several television documentaries. In 1993 Kunstler represented Yusuf Saalam of the Central Park 5 during his appeal, a move which alienated several friends. After Kunstler's death Saalam would be proven innocent when Matias Reyes confessed and DNA proved that Reyes was the sole attacker. During the 1994\u201395 television season, Kunstler starred as himself in an episode of Law & Order titled \"White Rabbit\", defending a woman charged with complicity in the 1971 murder of a policeman during the robbery of an armored car; the plot was based on the real-life story of Katherine Ann Power, who turned herself in to authorities in 1993. ==Death and legacy== In late 1995, Kunstler died in New York City of heart failure at the age of 76. In his last major public appearance, at the commencement ceremonies for the University at Buffalo's School of Architecture and Planning, Kunstler lambasted the death penalty, saying, \"We have become the charnel house of the Western world with reference to executions; the next closest to us is the Republic of South Africa.\" William Kunstler was survived by his wife Margaret Ratner Kunstler (who was previously married to Kunstler's close friend Michael Ratner) and his four daughters Karin Kunstler Goldman, Jane Drazek, Sarah Kunstler and Emily Kunstler, and several grandchildren. Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler produced a documentary about their father entitled William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe, which had a screening as part of the Documentary Competition of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.
