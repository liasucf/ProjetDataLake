Exhibition from April 12 to June 1, 2013. The latest solo show by Mustafa Maluka entitled 'Structural Disbelief: an imposition', deals with the social and political structure of prejudice and the various ways, both subtle and overt, in which people are pre-judged and dismissed because of their appearance. The show tackles the structural disbelief faced by successful, high achieving people who appear as 'others' within particular societies. It also explores fragments of dialogical transaction to which the characters in the paintings are subjected to as individuals who appear as \u0091other\u0092 within the societies that they live in. ==References== ==External links== * Galerie Bertrand and Gruner * Gallery Mikael Andersen * Jack Tilton Gallery * De Ateliers * Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis * Artist's Personal Website Category:South African painters Category:South African male painters Category:Living people Category:1976 births ",
