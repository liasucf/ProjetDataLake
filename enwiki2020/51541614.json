    "text": "The 1967 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) during the 1967 NCAA University Division football season. In their fourth and final season under head coach Bert Clark, the Cougars compiled a 2\u20138 record (1\u20135 in AAWU, tied for last), and were outscored 266 to 141. The team's statistical leaders included Jerry Henderson with 836 passing yards, Mark Williams with 415 rushing yards, and Doug Flansburg with 461 receiving yards. The Cougars won their first Apple Cup in nine years, a 9\u20137 win over the Huskies in Seattle. It was the final game on natural grass in Husky Stadium, which switched to AstroTurf in 1968. The Cougars played six conference opponents and finally met USC and UCLA; both were last on the schedule in 1958, the final season of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). The only conference team missed by WSU in 1967 was California. Clark was fired in late November with a season remaining on his three-year contract. He was succeeded in early January 1968 by Jim Sweeney, the head coach at Montana State in Bozeman, who agreed to a one-year contract at $20,000, and led the Cougars for eight seasons. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL/AFL Draft== One Cougar was selected in the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft. {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center\" |- |Dave Middendorf |Guard |5 |172 |Cincinnati Bengals |} : * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== ==External links== *Game program: UCLA vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 September 30, 1967 *Game program: Arizona State vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 October 21, 1967 *Game program: Idaho at WSU \u2013 November 11, 1967 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Washington ",
