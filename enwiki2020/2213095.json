    "text": "David L. Frishberg (born March 23, 1933) is an American jazz pianist, vocalist, composer, and lyricist born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His songs have been performed by Blossom Dearie, Rosemary Clooney, Shirley Horn, Anita O'Day, Michael Feinstein, Irene Kral, Diana Krall, Stacey Kent, John Pizzarelli and Mel Torm\u00e9. Frishberg wrote the music and lyrics for \"I'm Just a Bill\", the song about the forlorn legislative writ in the ABC Schoolhouse Rock! series, which was later transformed into the popular revue Schoolhouse Rock Live. For Schoolhouse Rock! he also wrote and performed \"Walkin' on Wall Street\", a song that describes how the stock market works, and \"$7.50 Once a Week\", a song about saving money and balancing a budget. == Biography == Frishberg resisted learning classical piano as a boy, developing an interest in blues and boogie- woogie by listening to recordings by Pete Johnson and Jay McShann. As a teenager he played in the house band at the Flame in St. Paul where Art Tatum, Billie Holiday, and Johnny Hodges appeared. After graduating from the University of Minnesota as a journalism major in 1955, Frishberg spent two years in the Air Force. In 1957, Frishberg moved to New York City, where he played solo piano at the Duplex in Greenwich Village. He first became known for his work with Carmen McRae, Ben Webster, Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Eddie Condon, Al Cohn, and Zoot Sims. Later he was celebrated for writing and performing his own, frequently humorous, songs, including favorites \"I'm Hip\" (lyrics only, in collaboration with Bob Dorough),\"Dave Frishberg Song Catalogue\".

In 1971, Frishberg moved to Los Angeles where he worked as a studio musician, and where he also recorded his first albums. In 1986, he moved to Portland, Oregon.https://www.davefrishberg.net/long_bio.php retrieved 10/20/17 Frishberg cites songwriter Frank Loesser as an influence, and has said that Loesser's \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\", along with Willie Nelson's \"Crazy\", are songs he wished he had written. Like Loesser before him, Frishberg has also worked strictly as a lyricist, collaborating with composers Johnny Mandel, Alan Broadbent, Al Cohn, Blossom Dearie, David Shire, Julius Wechter, Dan Barrett, Bob Brookmeyer, Bob Dorough, Gerry Mulligan, and Johnny Hodges. He was the co- recipient of the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song in 1981, having written the lyric to \"Baby Talk\" from the Burt Reynolds comedy film Paternity. Frishberg is a longtime baseball fan, and has been a member of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) since 1984.SABR Digital Library: Van Lingle Mungo: The Man, The Song, The Players, accessed December 19, 2014 In addition to \"Van Lingle Mungo\", he also wrote \"Matty\", a tribute to an early 20th century pitching great, which was included along with \"Play Ball\" and several other songs with baseball references, on the 1994 CD Quality Time.AllMusic review, by Scott Yanow, accessed December 19, 2014 ==Discography== * Oklahoma Toad (CTI, 1970) * Getting Some Fun Out of Life (Concord Jazz, 1977) * You're a Lucky Guy (Concord Jazz, 1978) * The Dave Frishberg Songbook Volume No. 1 (Omni Sound, 1981) * The Dave Frishberg Songbook Volume No. 2 (Omni Sound, 1983) * Live at Vine Street (Fantasy, 1985) * Can't Take You Nowhere (Fantasy, 1987) * Let's Eat Home (Concord Jazz, 1990) * Where You At?
