Since 1997, the company has focused on racing games. They are known for their largely-panned video game, Ride to Hell: Retribution, work with the NASCAR The Game franchise, and as a developer on various other racing titles and games. == History == === Zeppelin Games (1987\u20131994) === The company founder, Brian Jobling, started creating games for the Atari 800, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 personal computers at home in the early 1980s as a 14-year-old. With the money that he made, he started the company, Zeppelin Games, in November 1987 when he was 17. Zeppelin Games produced a large number of games for various home computer systems including Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST and Amiga and by the early 90s were also making games for PC and consoles such as the Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES. Popular games included Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge, International Tennis, Universal Warrior and Sink or Swim. They also worked with publisher Codemasters to produce the first two Micro Machines games and Pete Sampras Tennis. The company, being primarily a budget publisher, operated several labels for different price ranges; among them were Cognito and Impulze for full-price releases, Zeppelin Premier and Zeppelin Platinum. === Merit Studios Europe (1994\u20131996) === The company was acquired by American company Merit Studios, Inc. in 1994 and became known as Merit Studios Europe. As well as developing their own games, the company was also responsible for the marketing and distribution of Merit's US games in Europe. === Eutechnyx (1996\u2013present) === The company became Eutechnyx in 1996. After gaining registered developer and publisher status for the Sony PlayStation, the directors bought back the company from Merit with help from French publishers Infogrames. This started a 3-year agreement with Eutechnyx developing exclusively for Infogrames on the PlayStation and PC platforms. The end of this agreement meant that as of 2000, the company became a fully independent developer and currently releases games across many formats for publishing companies such as Electronic Arts and Namco. Since 1996, the company has specialised in driving and racing games of many types, including licensed titles such as James Bond 007, Max Power, Cartoon Network and The Fast and the Furious. As of 2009, Eutechnyx had studios in Gateshead, England, Hong Kong, Chengdu, and the United States. It employed almost 200 people. After the failure Of Ride to Hell Retribution, the London studio was closed in June 2013. In June 2013, several employees were loaned to Ubisoft Reflections and in February 2014, a restructuring was announced, with the loss of 12 jobs, taking the headcount to 130. In 2012, sister company ZeroLight was formed at the Gateshead offices, to apply the realtime rendering technology developed for racing games to showroom and online configurators for car manufacturers. In October 2013, Darren Jobling replaced his brother Brian as CEO, to take on a more active role in development, with Brian becoming Executive Chairman. In July 2014, again after the failure of Warhammer 40k Storm of Vengeance, following another re-structuring an additional 19 members of staff were lost. In July 2015, following commercially disappointing results from ambitious multiplayer online racing game ACR, a further 8 redundancies were made, with some of the 22 people announced as being added to sister firm ZeroLight, being relocated from Eutechnyx. In September 2016, Zerolight moved across the river from Eutechnyx' Gateshead office to LiveWorks, on the Quayside at Newcastle upon Tyne. == Games developed == === as Zeppelin Games === * 1988 Zybex (C64, ZX, Atari 8 Bit) * 1988 Draconus (C64, ZX, Atari 8 Bit) * 1988 Las Vegas Casino (C64, ZX, CPC, Atari 8 Bit) * 1988 Speed Ace (Atari 8 Bit) * 1989 Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge (C64, ZX, CPC, Atari 8 bit, Amiga) * 1989 Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager (C64, ZX, CPC, Atari 8 Bit, Amiga, Atari ST) * 1989 Living Daylights (The) (Atari 8 Bit - re-release from Domark) * 1989 Mirax Force (Atari 8 Bit - re-release from Tynesoft) * 1989 Mountain Bike Racer (C64, ZX, Atari 8 bit, MSX) * 1989 Ninja Commando (C64, ZX, CPC, Atari 8 Bit) * 1989 Phantom (Atari 8 Bit - re-release from Tynesoft/Micro Value) * 1989 Sidewinder (Atari 8 Bit - re-release from Futureware) * 1990 Fantastic Soccer (C64, Atari 8 Bit) * 1990 Fantastic American Football (ZX) * 1990 Edd The Duck!
