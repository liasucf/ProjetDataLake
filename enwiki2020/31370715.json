    "text": "William Bernard Conway (1802\u20131839) was an American politician and newspaperman who was the first secretary and first acting governor of Iowa Territory. Conway was born in New Castle County, Delaware. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1830, he started publishing The American Manufacturer, a newspaper supportive of the Democratic Party. In 1833, he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and opened a law practice, which he relocated from Pittsburgh to Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1835. While in Johnstown he founded a newspaper called the Mountaineer in early 1836; later in the same year he moved its publication to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. In 1838, he was appointed Secretary of the Iowa Territory and served briefly as acting governor until the arrival of the Iowa Territorial Governor Robert Lucas. Conway had never before held a political office; his appointment as secretary was said to have been in reward for his journalistic support of presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. Conway died in Davenport, Iowa Territory while in office in 1839. He was the writer of a poem, \"Bribed Legislator\", and a novel, The Cottage on the Cliff: A Tale of the Revolution. ==References== Category:Editors of Pennsylvania newspapers Category:Governors of Iowa Territory Category:Pennsylvania Jacksonians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from New Castle County, Delaware Category:Politicians from Pittsburgh Category:Writers from Delaware Category:Writers from Iowa Category:Writers from Pittsburgh Category:1802 births Category:1839 deaths Category:19th-century American newspaper editors Category:American male journalists Category:19th-century American newspaper founders Category:Journalists from South Dakota Category:Journalists from North Dakota Category:Journalists from Pennsylvania Category:Lawyers from Pittsburgh ",
