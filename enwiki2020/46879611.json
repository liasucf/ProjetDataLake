He played 21 games during 1982, but injuries cost him his first grade position until 1985 when he played on the wing for St George in the 1985 Grand Final. He stayed at Saints for one final season in 1986, but in 1987 he moved to Western Suburbs to reignite his career, but the move was ultimately unsuccessful.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 () ==References== Category:St. George Dragons players Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Living people Category:Western Suburbs Magpies players Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
