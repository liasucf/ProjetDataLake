Returning to the United States in 1812, he was appointed a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Patterson remained at Penn until 1828 when he joined the faculty of the University of Virginia. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. Patterson returned to Philadelphia in 1835 to become director of the U.S. Mint. He was asked by a committee of the American Philosophical Society in 1836 to write a brief report on recommendations for astronomical and physics observations to be carried out by the United States Exploring Expedition, which sailed in 1838. Ill health forced him to resign from the Mint in 1851. Patterson died in Philadelphia on September 5, 1854. He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia in Section H, Plot 13, 20, 25 & 26\\.

One of Patterson's ciphers included in a December 19, 1801 dated letter to Jefferson was decoded in 2007 by Lawren Smithline. The cipher consists of 7 digit pairs and is decoded by decrypting 7 blocks at a time. The cipher was of the Declaration of Independence, of which Jefferson was the primary author. Patterson called it his \"perfect cipher\" and Jefferson considered adopting it for government use. ==American Philosophical Society== Patterson was the youngest person elected to the American Philosophical Society at 22 in 1809. Four years later he was elected a secretary, the a vice-president in 1825.
