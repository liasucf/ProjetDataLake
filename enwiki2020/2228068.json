Its history has been convoluted, with several changes in name and status. ===Early years=== Keflav\u00edk Youth Club (Ungmennaf\u00e9lag Keflav\u00edkur, UMFK) was founded on 29 September 1929 by 28 young people in the town of Keflav\u00edk. The club became a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation which had been established in 1907 as part of Iceland's drive for independence. The Keflav\u00edk Youth Club was a typical youth club of the era; forming teams in swimming and athletics, teaching physical education, putting on theatre productions and supporting various local causes. An important part of the Youth Federation was appreciation for the country and its people and the movement was especially active in rural areas and small towns. Helgi S. J\u00f3nsson: '20 \u00e1ra afm\u00e6lisfagna\u00f0ur U.M.F.K.', Faxi 1949 (9:9\u201310), pp. 2\u20135 On 12 July 1950 a second sports club was founded in Keflav\u00edk, the Keflav\u00edk Football Club (Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Keflav\u00edkur, KFK). Despite its name, the club formed teams in football, handball and swimming.

On March 18, 1956 a new club was formed, Keflav\u00edk Sports Federation (\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Keflav\u00edkur, \u00cdBK). Similar sports federations were formed in towns around Iceland. The idea behind them was that various groups and clubs could come together to represent the town in various sports, often against other towns. Another aim was to enable sportsmen from smaller towns to compete against the bigger clubs from Reykjav\u00edk, especially in football and other team sports. The town federations also represented the town's clubs within national associations. In Keflav\u00edk the existing clubs were not disbanded but their operations were limited. Keflav\u00edk Youth Club continued to work within the national youth movement, mainly on social and cultural issues. Sporting activities within the youth club and Keflav\u00edk Football Club were virtually non-existent, although the youth club participated in the semi- annual national youth festival. The two clubs also played against each other in team sports like football and handball on special occasions in the town, like Independence Day.

A new sports federation was formed for the new town, Reykjanesb\u00e6r Sports Federation (\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Reykjanesb\u00e6jar,\u00cdRB). With the Keflav\u00edk club no longer a sports federation it was decided to form a new club, Keflav\u00edk Sports and Youth Club (Keflav\u00edk, \u00ed\u00fer\u00f3tta- og ungmennaf\u00e9lag), which was to be commonly known as Keflav\u00edk. The youth in the title was to indicate that the club was a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation. The new club also became a member of The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3tta- og \u00d3lymp\u00edusamband \u00cdslands, \u00cdS\u00cd) and Reykjanesb\u00e6r Sports Federation. ==References== ==External links== *Keflav\u00edk \u2013 Official website *The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland *The Icelandic Youth Federation *Reykjanesb\u00e6r Sports Federation Category:Football clubs in Iceland Category:Multi-sport clubs in Iceland Category:Keflav\u00edk ",
