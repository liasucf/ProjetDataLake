    "text": "Tallapragada Prakasarayudu (April 1893 \u2013 Feb 1988) was an Indian social reformer, freedom fighter, educationist, and writer. He was a prominent Gandhian and a distinguished exponent of Brahmoism. India has produced a few great men who led exemplary lives and silently influenced the lives of other men. Shri Prakasarayadu exemplifies the values of supreme self-sacrifice, personal rectitude, quiet efficiency and a desire to avoid lime light. His services in the cause of education are inestimable. Dedicated wholly to the Gandhian principles, Shri Prakasarayadu lived an unostentatious life. He grew cotton and spun on Charkha since 1921, devotedly performing the 'Sutra Yagna' of Gandhiji in spirit and action. After the independence of India, he continued his freedom struggle to leave no stone unturned to attain real freedom which consists in social justice and economic equality. He discharged his duties to all constructive programmes connected with national integration, social reform, religious harmony, propagation of Khadi, prohibition, basic education, anti-dowry movement, removal of untouchability and eradication of casteism. ==References== ==Gallery== TPR Charkha.jpg|Prakasarayadu spinning cotton on his charkha TPR with Veeresalingam Pantulu 1911.jpg|Tallapragada Prakasarayadu (top right) with his teacher and mentor, Sri Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu (centre) (1911) TPR at Ananda Niketan Ashram.jpg|Tallapragada Prakasarayadu (seated on chair, second from left) at the Ananda Niketan Ashram he established in 1924 (picture from 1928) TPR and Gandhi.jpg|Tallapragada Prakasarayadu, aged 90, speaking to students about Gandhian thought at the Andhra Mahila Sabha (1983) Category:1893 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Gandhians Category:Indian social reformers Category:People from West Godavari district Category:Indian independence activists from Andhra Pradesh ",
