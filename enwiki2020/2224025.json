    "text": "Matthew Gilbert \"Marty\" Mart\u00ednez (February 14, 1929 \u2013 October 15, 2011) was a Congressional representative who was both a member of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party from California's 30th congressional district from 1982 to 1993 and California's 31st congressional district from 1993 to 2001. Mart\u00ednez switched parties to become a Republican after being defeated in a 2000 primary. ==Early life== Mart\u00ednez's family moved to Los Angeles, California, when he was young, and he attended public schools in Los Angeles. In 1949 he graduated from Roosevelt High School. From 1947 to 1950 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of private first class. In 1956 he received a certificate of competence from the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. For the next fifteen years he owned and operated a custom furniture upholstery company and worked as a building contractor. ==Political career== He began his political career in 1971 when he became a member of the Monterey Park Planning Commission, and served until 1974 when he was elected to the Monterey Park City Council. He served until 1980, including two terms as mayor in 1974 and 1980. In 1980, Mart\u00ednez defeated incumbent Jack R. Fenton in the Democratic primary election in California's 59th State Assembly district. He was elected to the California State Assembly with no major-party opponent. In 1982 George E. Danielson left the U.S. House of Representatives to take the bench. Mart\u00ednez won the special election to succeed him, and was reelected nine times by varying margins. In his first term in Congress he was assigned to the Education and Labor Committee. In the 99th Congress (1985\u201387) he chaired the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities. In 1991, he became the Chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee. In 1992, Mart\u00ednez was named to the Foreign Affairs Committee, and served on the Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations and Human Rights. In 2000, Mart\u00ednez was defeated in the Democratic primary by liberal State Senator Hilda Solis 62% to 29%. She charged that he was out of touch with his district when he voted to ban partial-birth abortion and opposed gun control. (He was both Roman Catholic and a member of the National Rifle Association.) While he had been a reliably Democratic vote on most issues throughout his congressional career, after his primary loss Mart\u00ednez began to vote overwhelmingly with Republicans. On July 27, 2000, Mart\u00ednez switched to the Republican Party, arguing that the Democrats had abandoned him. There was no Republican candidate on the ballot in the district for the 2000 election, and Mart\u00ednez declined to attempt a write-in candidacy, though he remained critical of Solis and promised to stay active in the Republican party. His term in Congress ended on January 3, 2001, at the end of the 106th Congress. ==Family== Mart\u00ednez was married to Elvira Yorba Martinez, with whom he had five children: Matthew Adrian, Michael Gilbert, Diane, Susan, and Carol Ann. His daughter, Diane Mart\u00ednez, served in the State Assembly from 1992 to 1998. ==Death== On October 15, 2011, Mart\u00ednez died at his home in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He had suffered from congestive heart failure. ==Memberships== *San Gabriel Valley YMCA board of directors *Hispanic American Democrats *National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials *Communications Workers of America *Veterans of Foreign Wars *American Legion *Latin Business Association *Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce *Navy League (director) *Rotary International\"Matthew Gilbert Martinez.\" Marquis Who's Who TM.
