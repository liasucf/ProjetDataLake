    "text": "WAKY (620 kHz AM) is a classic hits radio station in the Louisville, Kentucky metropolitan area. It is currently owned by William Walters, through licensee W & B Broadcasting Co., Inc. The station used to share a significant portion of Spanish programming with sister station WTUV-FM (105.7 FM) until WTUV-FM was sold to UB Louisville and became English-language sports radio station WHBE-FM. The original station call letters, under different owners, were WTMT (1958\u20132010). The station was assigned the WAKY call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on April 1, 2015. On May 3, 2015, the format was changed to a simulcast of WAKY-FM, rebroadcasting their classic hits format. The WAKY call letters are evocative of the famous WAKY (790 kHz), a nationally influential Top 40 music station in Louisville (under other ownership, including McLendon Radio, Multimedia and LIN Broadcasting) from 1958 to 1986. Currently, the WAKY-AM-FM studios are south of the Ft. Knox Army Reservation in Radcliff, Kentucky, about 27 miles south of Louisville. The WAKY transmitter and antenna are located in the Oak Park area of Jeffersonville, Indiana. They also broadcast UK Football and Basketball games. ==External links== * * * * *FCC History Cards for WAKY AKY Category:1958 establishments in Kentucky Category:Radio stations established in 1958 ",
