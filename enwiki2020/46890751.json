He designed several ch\u00e2teaux, and undertook work on cathedrals in the French provinces. ==Early years== Solvay Castle Jean Jacques Nicolas Arveuf-Fransquin was born in Paris in 1802. He was admitted to the \u00e9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1822. In 1830 he was assigned to work on the abbey church of Saint-Denis. In 1832 he won second prize in an open competition for an exhibition hall in Tours. That year he was asked to report on the cathedrals of Auvergne, including those of Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy-en-Velay and Saint-Flour, Cantal. He was also charged with maintenance of the Cathedrals of Reims, Chalons and Saint-Flour. ==Secular architecture== Arveuf-Fransquin and the Belgian architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Coppens (1799-1873) were given the task of building Solvay Castle in the forest of Soinges, Belgium. It was completed in 1842. Arveuf built the Ch\u00e2teau de Boursault in the Marne valley for Madame Clicquot Ponsardin, the \"Veuve Cliquot\" who founded the champagne brand. It was located on the wooded summit of a hill planted with vines, and dominates the surrounding countryside and the village of Boursault. Construction began in 1843 and was completed in 1850. Organ of Ch\u00e2lons Cathedral ==Church architecture== In 1843 Arveuf submitted a plan for restoration of Notre Dame de Paris in competition with Jean-Charles Danjoy and with the winning team of Jean-Baptiste Lassus and Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. Arveuf's design was criticized for slighting the historical in favor of the religious function. In 1844 Arveuf presented a project for a high altar for the cathedral of Clermont- Ferrand. Arveuf was made diocesan architect for the Cathedral of Rheims in 1848. Arveuf designed the neo-Flamboyant organ case of the Ch\u00e2lons Cathedral. The case was created by the cabinetmaker Etienne Gabriel Ventadour, and housed the instrument made by John Abbey, who delivered the instrument in 1849. In 1851 Arveuf built the churches of Eurville and Fayl-Billot in Haute-Marne. Viollet-le-Duc wrote of him in 1853 that he was known to be an excellent architect, and the works done under his leadership were well-planned and well- managed. However, he was working on outside projects and was not spending enough time at Reims. He was temporarily replaced by Viollet-le-Duc in 1860, and permanently replaced in 1862. He died in 1876. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:1802 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Architects from Paris Category:19th-century French architects ",
