    "text": "Methenmadinone caproate (MMC, also known as superlutin caproate) is a progestin medication which was developed in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and was studied for potential use in combined injectable contraceptives in the 1970s but was never marketed. It was studied as a combined injectable contraceptive in combination with estradiol valerate at doses of 60 mg and 10 mg, respectively, once a month by intramuscular injection (tentative brand name Lutofollin). MMC is the C17\u03b1 caproate (hexanoate) ester of methenmadinone and an analogue of methenmadinone acetate (MMA; superlutin). In addition to MMA, analogues of MMC include chlormadinone caproate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone caproate, and megestrol caproate. ==See also== * Estradiol valerate/methenmadinone caproate * List of progestogen esters \u00a7 Esters of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Caproate esters Category:Diketones Category:Pregnanes Category:Progestogen esters Category:Progestogens ",
