    "text": "Hyman Hurwitz (1770\u20131844) was a learned Jew who became first professor of Hebrew at University College, London. He was born in Pozna\u0144, Poland in 1770, came to England about 1797 and conducted a private academy for Jews at Highgate, where he established a close friendship with Samuel Taylor Coleridge and corresponded with him. Coleridge once described Hurwitz as \"the first Hebrew and Rabbinical Scholar in the Kingdom\". In 1828, on Coleridge's recommendation, he was elected professor of the Hebrew language and literature at University College, London. His inaugural lecture was published. He died on 18 July 1844. Hurwitz was buried in the Brady Street Cemetery near Whitechapel in London's East End. ==Works== * Vindiciae Hebraicae, being a Defence of the Hebrew Scriptures as a Vehicle of Revealed Religion, in Refutation of J.
