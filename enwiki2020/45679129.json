But he corrected me, saying, 'I am not stupid to invest resources without reason'.\" She also added, \"Experience-wise I am a beginner but I think it's a wonderful time to be in the industry. There is so much happening, so much changing. I feel proud that I am doing my first film with my father.\" This movie debut led her to win six awards.

After the release of Fan, Pilgaonkar was overwhelmed by the response.
