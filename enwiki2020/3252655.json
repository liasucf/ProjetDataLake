Built in 1995, it was one of the first outdoor rockwalls in a secondary school. Over the years, thousands of Springfielders have learnt the basics of sports climbing and many have excelled in the sport. The emphasis of the Sports climbing programme was not just about skills but also on safety and the proper use and maintaining the integrity of equipment. Sports climbing has indeed toughened up Springfielders. Sports climbing has developed mental strength and inculcated qualities such as integrity, resilience and perseverance. Springfield shares the use of her Rockwall and expertise with the community as well. Springfield have hosted various groups from the Tampines constituency sports club, handicapped organisations such as the visually handicapped, hospital help- groups and the deaf. Springfield rockwall has often been used by other schools, the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University, and uniformed group organisations such as the Boys\u2019 Brigade, Salvation Army and The Singapore Mountaineering Federation. The popularity and success of Springfield climbing have produced more than 7 National climbers among Springfielders over the last 10 years. These pupils travelled all over the world to represent Singapore in World, Regional and other international competitions. Springfield has won 4 National Championships in the SAFRA National Sports Climbing Championships over the past 9 years and successfully mounted a multi-peak expedition to the Nepal Himalaya in 2000 and recently in 2008. A notable Springfielder, Foo Xiu Guan, is doing Singapore proud in the South-East Asian Circuit as well as the World Youth Championships. The school has been successful in competitions in Sports Climbing through its participation in local Sports Climbing events as well as in School-organised events such as \"Let's Rock\". Springfield climbers have been consistently placed in all competitions we have participated in. Of special mention is the excellent achievement during the National Schools Sports Climbing Championship 2008 in which Springfield emerged Overall School Champion and the Asian Youth & National School Sport Climbing Championship from 23 to 25 November 2007.
