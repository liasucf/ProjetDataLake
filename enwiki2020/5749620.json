Passaglia was the placekicker/punter for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League for a record-breaking 25 years (1976\u20132000) and scored more points in that time than any professional gridiron football player in history.

In 2006, Passaglia was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#30) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. ==High school and college career== After playing quarterback at Notre Dame Regional Secondary School in East Vancouver, Passaglia, not straying far from home, accepted an athletic scholarship to local Simon Fraser University in suburban Burnaby, British Columbia. At Simon Fraser, Passaglia played wide receiver as well as kicker/punter. As a member of the Clan, Passaglia recorded 175 career points, won All NAIA District 1 honours twice, and was named an All-Northwest All-Star. Passaglia was the fifth-overall selection of the BC Lions in the 1976 CFL season Canadian College Draft, as a kicker and wide receiver. ==Canadian Football League career== Passaglia caught a 10-yard touchdown pass in his first CFL game on July 22, of the 1976 CFL season against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. His only other career touchdown came on a one-yard run in his final home game at BC Place Stadium, on November 4, of the 2000 season, again against the Roughriders. Between those two touchdown \"bookends,\" Passaglia arguably became one of the most consistent performers in Lions', CFL, and professional football history. Lui Passaglia and teammate Damon Allen with the Grey Cup in January 2001 Passaglia played the most CFL regular seasons at 25, the most CFL regular season games at 408, and scored the most points in regular season play with 3,991 points, all with one team: the BC Lions. Passaglia was the first player to score 200 points in a season (1987), with 214 points.

Passaglia is the second all-time CFL punt leader with 3,142 for 133,826 yards (behind Bob Cameron), with the second highest average in a season (1983 CFL season) of 50.2 yards (Jon Ryan had a higher average in the 2005 season). In CFL playoff games, Passaglia holds records for most points with 210, is tied for most field goals with 48, and has the longest recorded punt of 89 yards. As a Lion, Passaglia was named a CFL Western Division All-Star nine times, and was a CFL All-Star four times (1979, 1983, 1984, and 2000 seasons). Passaglia was a member of three of the Lions' Grey Cup seasons (1985, 1994, and 2000 seasons), winning the Dick Suderman Trophy as the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian twice (73rd Grey Cup and 82nd Grey Cup). Passaglia is the longest-playing Lion in team history, appearing in a total of 408 games, overtaking Leos' great Al Wilson's previous mark of 233 games. Passaglia retired from the CFL following the Lions' 28\u201326 88th Grey Cup victory over the Montreal Alouettes in the 2000 season, where he kicked the winning points in the game. In the 2003 season, Passaglia was voted a member of the BC Lions All-Time Dream Team, at the kicker and punter positions, as part of the club's 50 year anniversary celebration. In November 2006, Passaglia was voted #30 of the CFL's top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Passaglia's last-second field goal in 1994's 82nd Grey Cup game at BC Place, which clinched the championship for the Lions over the Baltimore Football Club, was named the greatest play in BC Lions history in 2007. By the time of his retirement, Passaglia had been a member of the Lions for over half of its then-47-season history. Consistently a fan favorite, home crowds consistently chanted his given name in a long drawn-out manner (such that it sounded like an extended \"Loo...\") whenever he came on the field, particularly when attempting crucial field goals. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Season !!
