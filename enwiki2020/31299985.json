    "text": "The succession of power in China takes place in the context of a single party system. Despite the guarantee of universal franchise in the constitution, the appointment of the Paramount Leader lies largely in the hands of his predecessor and the powerful factions that control the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The appointment of the leader occurs after two five year terms in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. But this was changed to three of four five year terms during the first plenary session of the 19th national Congress of the Communist Policy of China. ==Structure of Power== It is generally accepted that the Paramount leader of China holds these three official titles: * General Secretary of the Communist Party of China - Head of the Ruling party * President of the People's Republic of China - Nominal head of state * Chairman of the Central Military Commission - Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces (People's Liberation Army) In the past it was possible for the Paramount Leader to wield absolute power without holding any of the highest offices. This was the case with Deng Xiaoping who was the undisputed leader from 1978 to 1992 without holding any of the highest offices of party and state. Since his retirement, power has become more structured with the leader holding all three of the previously mentioned offices. ==History== The concept of Paramount Leader was instituted during the era of Mao Zedong. The position was further established under Deng Xiaoping, however the term Paramount Leader has not been officially attributed to any other leaders. Since the retirement of Deng Xiaoping in 1992, political power in China has been held collectively by the members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China. The General Secretary may be best described as primus inter pares, first among equals. Because the proceedings of this body are considered a state secret, the inner workings of Politburo are not made public. It is clear, however, that decision making has become consensus driven and that no single figure can any longer act unilaterally as in the days of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. ==Constitutional Mechanism== Constitutional power in the People's Republic of China is held by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCCPC). Although this group of approximately 300 members does not have power in the same way as a traditional legislative body, the most important and senior officials of the Chinese government are all members. Within the CCCPC is the Politburo of the Communist Party of China. This body is a group of 25 individuals (currently 24 men and one woman) who govern the Communist Party of China (CCP). Theoretically, the Politburo is elected by the CCCPC; however, in practice any new member of the Politburo is chosen by the current members. Politburo members hold positions in China's national government and regional positions of power simultaneously thereby consolidating the CCP\u2019s power. In the case of key policy decisions, topics are addressed in the Politburo which then determines actions to be taken by the national and local government. The policy direction for the entire country rests in the hands of these 25 individuals who meet together once a month. Admission into the Politburo is extremely difficult. Tight control over the body is exercised by current members who vet potential members carefully to maintain the balance of power. Good political relationships within the Politburo are essential for admittance into the group. All members of the Politburo are elected for five year terms. 19th Politburo In stroke order of surnames: Power within the Politburo is further concentrated in the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China. This group of seven members meets together weekly and is led by the General Secretary. 19th Politburo Standing Committee Ordered in political position ranking #Xi Jinping #Li Keqiang #Li Zhanshu #Wang Yang #Wang Huning #Zhao Leji #Han Zheng The election of executive leadership in the PRC is done through a process that can best be described as an indirect election. In this system, only one candidate stands for the election of any given position. Although other candidates are not allowed to formally run, write in candidates are permitted. In 2013, when the 12th National People's Congress elected Xi Jinping as president, 2952 members voted in favor and one against, with three abstentions. Similarly, in the 2008 election, Hu Jintao, then-General Secretary, President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, was re-elected by a landside. Of the 2985 members of the 11th National People's Congress, only 3 voted against Hu Jintao with another 5 abstaining. ==Practical Mechanism== In practical terms, the National Congress provides a rubber stamp on a decision that is made by the Politburo and the Standing Committee. The transition of leadership can take several months. For instance, when Hu Jintao took over power from Jiang Zemin, the transition of power stretched out almost 2 years. Listed below are the dates on which Hu was appointed to each office. *General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (November 2002) *President of the People's Republic of China (March 2003) *Chairman of the Central Military Commission (September 2004) Usually the office of Chairman of the Central Military Commission is the last office handed over by the previous leader, in order to secure political influence and ensure political continuity. ==Most Recent Transition== Appointments to key offices are the best predictor of who the next leader will be. The office of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) is seen by many as the last stop before becoming the leader of China. Appointment to this position is so crucial that when Xi Jinping, the current General Secretary failed to achieve this office at the 4th Plenum in 2009, many analysts suggested that he had fallen from favor and would not be the next leader of the PRC. His ultimate appointment to Vice Chairman of the CMC was seen as evidence that he had begun to consolidate his power and would ultimately succeed Hu Jintao when his term expired in 2012 at the 18th party congress. Absent a transparent electoral process, the appointment to key positions is the only way to predict future leadership in the PRC. Note in the table below, the path that Xi Jinping followed from a low level party official at the age of 30 to his current position of the leader of the largest country in the world.

In this context, the appointment of a candidate to key offices is still the best indicator of their future role. For example, the appointment of Xi Jinping as the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China signposted with a reasonable amount of confidence that he would be the next leader of the People's Republic of China. == See also == * General Secretary of the Communist Party of China * List of Chinese leaders * Paramount Leader * Orders of precedence in China * Premier of the People's Republic of China * President of the People's Republic of China == References == Category:Politics of China Category:Government of China Category:China-related lists ",
