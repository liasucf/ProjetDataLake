    "text": "Municipal and mayoral elections were held in Marseille in March 2008, at the same time as other French municipal elections. The incumbent Mayor of the city, Jean-Claude Gaudin (UMP) faced Socialist candidate and Senator Jean-No\u00ebl Gu\u00e9rini. While polls in January and February indicated that Gaudin was safe, later polls showed the race tied and the 3rd sector of the city, a marginal UMP area, was likely to decide the election. Elections in Marseille depend not on the number of votes polled but the number of sectors won (there are 8 sectors). The same system applies in Lyon and Paris. Gaudin was re-elected and will serve as mayor until 2014. ==Results== ===1st Sector=== ===2nd Sector=== ===3rd Sector=== ===4th Sector=== ===5th Sector=== ===6th Sector=== ===7th Sector=== ===8th Sector=== ==See also== *2008 French municipal elections *2008 Paris municipal election *2008 Lyon municipal election Category:2008 elections in France Category:Municipal elections in France ",
