    "text": "The is a five-axle C-B wheel arrangement diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotive type operated in Japan since 1968. A total of 116 locomotives were built between 1968 and 1979, and , 10 locomotives remain in service, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight). ==Variants== A total of 116 locomotives were built between 1968 and 1979, divided into the following sub-classes. * Class DE11-0: 65 locomotives built between 1968 and 1970 * Class DE11-1000: 46 locomotives built between 1970 and 1974 with uprated engines * Class DE11-1900: One locomotive built in 1975 with experimental noise-reduction features * Class DE11-2000: 4 locomotives built in 1979 with noise-reduction features ==Design== The Class DE11 was developed from the Class DE10 locomotive design, with the train- heating steam generator and multiple-working equipment removed and replaced with concrete ballast weight to increase the axle load from 13 t to 14 t to improve adhesion for use in shunting work. ==History== ===DE11-0=== JNR DE11 11 in August 1985 65 locomotives were built between 1968 and 1970. ===DE11-1000=== 46 locomotives were built between 1970 and 1974 with their engines uprated from to . Locomotives DE11 1030, 1032, 1035, and 1046 were fitted with \"SLC\" (Shunting Locomotive Control) equipment to allow remote control at Musashino Marshalling Yard in Saitama Prefecture.

Features included additional sound-insulating around the engine compartment and a noise reduction unit on the exhaust chimney. DE11 1901 was withdrawn in 2000. ===DE11-2000=== Four Class DE11-2000 locomotives, numbered DE11 2001 to 2004 were built in 1979, incorporating some of the noise-reduction features tried out on DE11 1901. These locomotives also feature skirting to reduce noise. The locomotive length was increased from to .
