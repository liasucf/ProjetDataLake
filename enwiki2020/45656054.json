They lie within the H\u00fctten Hills Nature Park. == Geography == === Location === The H\u00fctten Hills \u2212 part of the Schleswig- Holstein Uplands \u2212 lie roughly between Fleckeby to the north, Ascheffel to the east, Alt and Neu Duvenstedt to the south and Brekendorf to the west. Their neighbouring landscapes are the large Schleswig Geest to the west, Schwansen to the northeast and the Danish Wahld to the east. === H\u00fctten Hills Nature Park === The boundaries of the nature park (NSG No. 33392), which was established in 1971 and covers an area of about 219 km\u00b2, extends far beyond that of the H\u00fctten Hills to the west and almost reaches the Bay of Eckernf\u00f6rde in the east. To the north is the Schlei Nature Park and to the south \u2013 on the other side of the Kiel Canal \u2013 is the Westensee Nature Park. The nature park covers the following municipalities (most of which belong to the Amt of H\u00fcttener Berge): Ahlefeld, Alt Duvenstedt, Ascheffel, Bistensee, Borgstedt, Brekendorf, B\u00fcnsdorf, Damendorf, Gro\u00df Wittensee, Haby, Holtsee, Holzbunge, H\u00fctten, Klein Wittensee, Neu Duvenstedt, Osterby, Owschlag and Sehestedt. The lakes of the nature park are the: Bistensee, Fresensee, Heidteich, Owschlager See and Wittensee. Its rivers and streams include the: Alte Eider, H\u00fcttener Au, M\u00fchlenbach, Osterbek, Sorge und Schirnau. The Nature Park Way links five nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein. === Hills and landscape === The Aschberg The highest point of the H\u00fctten Hills is the Scheelsberg near Ascheffel. On the nearby Aschberg stands a Bismarck statue and on the dome of the Heidberg (Heideberg), which is popular with hikers, lies a glacial erratic. From the hills may be seen inter alia the Bay of Eckernf\u00f6rde and the Schlei. Amongst the hills in the H\u00fctten range are the following \u2013 with their heights in metres (m) above sea level (NHN): * Scheelsberg (105.8 m), west of Ascheffel * eine Erhebung (105.1 m), northwest of Ascheffel * Aschberg (97.7 m), south of Ascheffel * Heidberg (also called the Heideberg; 99.1 m), west-southwest of Ascheffel * Brekenberg (90.0 m), northeast of Brekendorf * Immenberg (82.0 m), east-southeast of Brekendorf * Arnsberg (80.1 m), east of Brekendorf * T\u00fctenberg (74.6 m), southwest of Hummelfeld-Fellhorst The H\u00fctten Hills are the northernmost hill range with elevations over 100 metres in Germany. They are, however, lower than the highest points of Holstein Switzerland (highest point: the Bungsberg, 167.4 m) between Kiel and L\u00fcbeck. == Climate == A feature of the H\u00fctten Hills is its very variable microclimate. Whilst the western side near Owschlag has averaged annual temperatures of 9.3 \u00b0C (1997\u20132005), the village of Ascheffel on the eastern side has an average temperature of 9.8 \u00b0C. This is due to the gently elevated and relatively sheltered location of this settlement. In addition on the western side of the hills the average annual precipitation is around 930 mm (l/m\u00b2) which is much higher than in the east, where it is only 660 mm. == See also == * List of nature parks in Germany == References == == External links == * Naturpark H\u00fcttener Berge, auf naturpark- huettenerberge.de * Amt H\u00fcttener Berge, auf amt-huettener-berge.de * Panorama \u00fcber die H\u00fcttener Berge vom Aschberg (mit zuschaltbarer Beschriftung von Sichtzielen), auf panorama-photo.net Category:Nature parks in Schleswig- Holstein Category:Regions of Schleswig-Holstein Category:Rendsburg-Eckernf\u00f6rde ",
