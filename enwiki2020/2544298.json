    "text": "The term Hebraic law refers to a set of ancient Hebrew Law as found in the Torah of the Hebrew Bible also known as Mosaic Law. However, the Talmud rather than the Hebraic law is considered the beginning of the Jewish law. The Hebraic law has a great similarity to the law as proclaimed by ancient monarchs of the Middle East, including Hammurabi of the 18th\u201317th century BC and his famous law code known as the Code of Hammurabi, and the law Code of Lipit Ishtar of the 20th century BC. Hebraic law, in a formal sense, may be construed to begin in the Book of Exodus, chapter 20, with the words :And the Lord said unto Moses, thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. There are legal scholars who cite that the Hebraic law has contributed to the Western legal development as seen in the latter's recognition that man-made law must give way to the God- given moral law in when these two are in conflict. Like the Islamic law, the Hebraic law also influenced ethics associated with the Anglo-American common law. ==References== Category:Jewish law ",
