    "text": "Acetal protection of a ketone with ethylene glycol during reduction of an ester, vs. reduction to a diol when unprotected. A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction. It plays an important role in multistep organic synthesis. In many preparations of delicate organic compounds, some specific parts of their molecules cannot survive the required reagents or chemical environments. Then, these parts, or groups, must be protected. For example, lithium aluminium hydride is a highly reactive but useful reagent capable of reducing esters to alcohols. It will always react with carbonyl groups, and this cannot be discouraged by any means. When a reduction of an ester is required in the presence of a carbonyl, the attack of the hydride on the carbonyl has to be prevented. For example, the carbonyl is converted into an acetal, which does not react with hydrides. The acetal is then called a protecting group for the carbonyl. After the step involving the hydride is complete, the acetal is removed (by reacting it with an aqueous acid), giving back the original carbonyl. This step is called deprotection. Protecting groups are more commonly used in small-scale laboratory work and initial development than in industrial production processes because their use adds additional steps and material costs to the process. However, the availability of a cheap chiral building block can overcome these additional costs (e.g. shikimic acid for oseltamivir). ==Common protecting groups== ===Alcohol protecting groups=== Protection of alcohols: :Protection of alcohol as tetrahydropyranyl ether followed by deprotection. Both steps require acid catalysts. * Acetyl (Ac) \u2013 Removed by acid or base (see Acetoxy group). * Benzoyl (Bz) \u2013 Removed by acid or base, more stable than Ac group. * Benzyl (Bn) \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis. Bn group is widely used in sugar and nucleoside chemistry. * \u03b2-Methoxyethoxymethyl ether (MEM) \u2013 Removed by acid. * Dimethoxytrityl, [bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)phenylmethyl] (DMT) \u2013 Removed by weak acid. DMT group is widely used for protection of 5'-hydroxy group in nucleosides, particularly in oligonucleotide synthesis. * Methoxymethyl ether (MOM) \u2013 Removed by acid. * Methoxytrityl [(4-methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethyl] (MMT) \u2013 Removed by acid and hydrogenolysis. * p-Methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) \u2013 Removed by acid, hydrogenolysis, or oxidation. * p-Methoxyphenyl ether (PMP) \u2013 Removed by oxidation. * Methylthiomethyl ether \u2013 Removed by acid. * Pivaloyl (Piv) \u2013 Removed by acid, base or reductant agents. It is substantially more stable than other acyl protecting groups. * Tetrahydropyranyl (THP) \u2013 Removed by acid. * Tetrahydrofuran (THF) \u2013 Removed by acid. * Trityl (triphenylmethyl, Tr) \u2013 Removed by acid and hydrogenolysis. * Silyl ether (most popular ones include trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), tri-iso- propylsilyloxymethyl (TOM), and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) ethers) \u2013 Removed by acid or fluoride ion. (such as NaF, TBAF (tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, HF- Py, or HF-NEt3)). TBDMS and TOM groups are used for protection of 2'-hydroxy function in nucleosides, particularly in oligonucleotide synthesis. * Methyl ethers \u2013 Cleavage is by TMSI in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or chloroform. An alternative method to cleave methyl ethers is BBr3 in DCM * Ethoxyethyl ethers (EE) \u2013 Cleavage more trivial than simple ethers e.g. 1N hydrochloric acid ===Amine protecting groups=== BOC glycine. The tert-butyloxycarbonyl group is marked blue. Protection of amines: * Carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis * p-Methoxybenzyl carbonyl (Moz or MeOZ) group \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than Cbz * tert-Butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) group (common in solid phase peptide synthesis) \u2013 Removed by concentrated strong acid (such as HCl or CF3COOH), or by heating to >80 \u00b0C. * 9-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group (Common in solid phase peptide synthesis) \u2013 Removed by base, such as piperidine * Acetyl (Ac) group is common in oligonucleotide synthesis for protection of N4 in cytosine and N6 in adenine nucleic bases and is removed by treatment with a base, most often, with aqueous or gaseous ammonia or methylamine. Ac is too stable to be readily removed from aliphatic amides. * Benzoyl (Bz) group is common in oligonucleotide synthesis for protection of N4 in cytosine and N6 in adenine nucleic bases and is removed by treatment with a base, most often with aqueous or gaseous ammonia or methylamine. Bz is too stable to be readily removed from aliphatic amides. * Benzyl (Bn) group \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis * Carbamate group \u2013 Removed by acid and mild heating. * p-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than benzyl * 3,4-Dimethoxybenzyl (DMPM) \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than p-methoxybenzyl * p-Methoxyphenyl (PMP) group \u2013 Removed by ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (CAN) * Tosyl (Ts) group \u2013 Removed by concentrated acid (HBr, H2SO4) & strong reducing agents (sodium in liquid ammonia or sodium naphthalenide) * Troc (trichloroethyl chloroformate ) group \u2013 Removed by Zn insertion in the presence of acetic acid * Other Sulfonamides (Nosyl & Nps) groups \u2013 Removed by samarium iodide, tributyltin hydride ===Carbonyl protecting groups=== Protection of carbonyl groups: * Acetals and Ketals \u2013 Removed by acid. Normally, the cleavage of acyclic acetals is easier than of cyclic acetals. * Acylals \u2013 Removed by Lewis acids. * Dithianes \u2013 Removed by metal salts or oxidizing agents. ===Carboxylic acid protecting groups=== Protection of carboxylic acids: * Methyl esters \u2013 Removed by acid or base. * Benzyl esters \u2013 Removed by hydrogenolysis. * tert-Butyl esters \u2013 Removed by acid, base and some reductants. * Esters of 2,6-disubstituted phenols (e.g. 2,6-dimethylphenol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) \u2013 Removed at room temperature by DBU-catalyzed methanolysis under high-pressure conditions. * Silyl esters \u2013 Removed by acid, base and organometallic reagents. * Orthoesters \u2013 Removed by mild aqueous acid to form ester, which is removed according to ester properties. * Oxazoline \u2013 Removed by strong hot acid (pH < 1, T > 100 \u00b0C) or alkali (pH > 12, T > 100 \u00b0C), but not e.g. LiAlH4, organolithium reagents or Grignard (organomagnesium) reagents ===Phosphate protecting groups=== * 2-cyanoethyl \u2013 removed by mild base. The group is widely used in oligonucleotide synthesis. * Methyl (Me) \u2013 removed by strong nucleophiles e.c. thiophenole/TEA. ===Terminal alkyne protecting groups=== * Propargyl alcohols in the Favorskii reaction, * Silyl groups, especially in protection of the acetylene itself. ===Other=== * Photolabile protecting groups ==Orthogonal protection== Orthogonal protection of L-Tyrosine (Protecting groups are marked in blue, the amino acid is shown in black). (1) Fmoc-protected amino group, (2) benzyl ester protected carboxyl group and (3) tert-butyl ether protected phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyrosine. Orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the specific deprotection of one protective group in a multiply-protected structure without affecting the others. For example, the amino acid tyrosine could be protected as a benzyl ester on the carboxyl group, a fluorenylmethylenoxy carbamate on the amine group, and a tert-butyl ether on the phenol group. The benzyl ester can be removed by hydrogenolysis, the fluorenylmethylenoxy group (Fmoc) by bases (such as piperidine), and the phenolic tert-butyl ether cleaved with acids (e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid). A common example for this application, the Fmoc-peptide synthesis, in which peptides are grown in solution and on solid phase is very important. The protecting groups in solid-phase synthesis with regard to the reaction conditions such as reaction time, temperature and reagents can be standardized so that they are carried out by a machine, while yields of well over 99% can be achieved. Otherwise, the separation of the resulting mixture of reaction products is virtually impossible.Weng C. Chan, Peter D. White: Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, S. 10\u201312. The technique was introduced in the field of peptide synthesis by Robert Bruce Merrifield in 1977. As a proof of concept orthogonal deprotection is demonstrated in a photochemical transesterification by trimethylsilyldiazomethane utilizing the kinetic isotope effect: :Orthogonal protection Application in Photochemistry Due to this effect the quantum yield for deprotection of the right-side ester group is reduced and it stays intact. Significantly by placing the deuterium atoms next to the left-side ester group or by changing the wavelength to 254 nm the other monoarene is obtained. ==Criticism== The use of protective groups is pervasive but not without criticism. In practical terms their use adds two steps (protection-deprotection sequence) to a synthesis, either or both of which can dramatically lower chemical yield. Crucially, added complexity impedes the use of synthetic total synthesis in drug discovery. In contrast biomimetic synthesis does not employ protective groups.
