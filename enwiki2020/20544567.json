International Hope School Bangladesh == History and campus == Founder Principal Kazim Eldes established ITHS in Dhaka in 1996. The President of Turkey, S\u00fcleyman Demirel, a strong supporter of Turkish schools, officially inaugurated the school while on a state visit in March 1997. The school started as one campus in rented premises serving a small number of very young students. It has since grown to eight campuses in three cities: two preschools, two junior sections (grades 15), and two senior sections (one boys, one girls) in the Gulshan and Uttara areas of Dhaka, a branch in Chittagong that spans from preschool through grade 10, and a preschool and junior section in Bogra. Combined enrollment has risen to 1,500 as of 2014. ITHS began construction of a purpose-built campus on two acres of land granted by the Bangladesh government, located in Uttara Sector 4, in June 2002. Construction was finished in September 2005. Facilities include an extensive playground, football field, basketball court, conference hall, library, and computer and science lab. There are boys and girls hostels for boarders. The school later changed its name to International Hope School Bangladesh.
