SC38NE SC39788811\" is the highest mountain and the only summit higher than on the Isle of Man, at above sea level. The summit is crowned by a railway station, cafe and several communications masts. ==Views== It is a well-known saying in the Isle of Man that on a clear day six kingdoms can be seen from the top: the Isle of Man, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Heaven.Isle of Man guide website Some versions add a seventh kingdom, that of Manann\u00e1n (or the sea).Manx Notebook website The plaque at the summit indicates the directions of five points from Snaefell as well as their distances: * to the Mull of Galloway (Scotland) * to Scafell (England) * to the Mountains of Mourne (Northern Ireland) * to Liverpool (England) * to Dublin (Republic of Ireland) Wales isnt mentioned, but can be seen from Man. ==Climbing Snaefell== The Snaefell Mountain Railway has a seasonal electric tram service, typically from April to October, which climbs the from Laxey to the summit. The A18 Snaefell Mountain Road passes over the slopes of Snaefell, and is the highest section of the Snaefell Mountain Course over which the Isle of Man TT Races are held. Walkers often use the car park on this road near the Bungalow railway station (last railway stop before the summit) from which there is a rough path to the peak. The trail has sections of gravel, slate stones, grass and rock. While the angle of ascent steepens significantly closer to the summit, special climbing equipment is not required. However, caution is required in steep areas as the grass, earth and rocks are often slippery. Average climb time on foot on a dry footpath is about 45 minutes. A geodetic marker embedded in the small, concrete obelisk indicates the true mountain summit. The rock cairn standing nearby has an information plaque on top. ==Weather== In 1970, the automated weather station at the Snaefell summit recorded a gust of 150 mph which was one of the highest wind speeds ever recorded in the British Isles.Birmingham Daily Post page 35 Wednesday 4 November 1970 During hurricane storm force winds, the 120 foot tall Civil Aviation Authority radio mast at the Snaefell summit was damaged and blown down on 2 December 1966.Birmingham Daily Post page 27 Saturday 3 December 1966 ==Gallery== Image:Snaefell Mountain Walking Trail - Isle of Man - kingsley - 24-JUN-09.jpg|Footpath entry near Bungalow railway station typically used to climb Snaefell Image:Snaefell with Snaefell Mountain Railway.jpg|The Snaefell Mountain Railway on the ascent of Snaefell Image:Summit Hotel - Snaefell Mountain - kingsley - 24-APR-09.jpg|Defunct hotel (now cafe) near the summit Image:Snaefell Mountain Summit - Isle of Man - kingsley - 24-APR-09.jpg|Top of Snaefell with geodetic marker and nearby cairn with plaque Image:Plaque atop Snaefell Mountain - Isle of Man - kingsley - 24-JUN-09.jpg|Plaque pointing out the directions of landmarks and their distances from the summit ==References== ==External links== * Computer generated summit panoramas North South Index * Snaefell Mountain Railway * Cold War RADAR Site * Snaefell Fell Race Category:Hardys of England Category:Marilyns of the Isle of Man Category:Mountains and hills of the Isle of Man ",
