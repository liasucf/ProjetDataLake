During this period, the Byzantine state reached its greatest extent since the Muslim conquests, and the Macedonian Renaissance in letters and arts began. The dynasty was named after its founder, Basil I the Macedonian who came from the Theme of Macedonia, which, at the time, was part of Thrace. ==Origins== Claims have been made for the dynasty's founder being of Armenian,Peter Charanis.Studies on the demography of the Byzantine empire: collected studies Variorum Reprints, 1972 p223(360):\"Thus, every emperor who sat on the Byzantine throne the accession of Basil I to the death of Basil II (867\u20141025) was of Armenian or partially Armenian origin. But besides the emperors there were many others among the military and political leaders of Byzantine during this period who were Armenians or of Armenian descent\" Slavic,. Tobias is referring to the writings of Hamza al-Isfahani, a 10th-century Persian scholar.. or indeed \"Armeno-Slavonic\" descent. Hence, the dynasty is also referred to as the Armenian Dynasty by some scholars, such as George Bournoutian and Mack Chahin.Chahin, Mack. The Kingdom of Armenia: A History. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2001, p. 232 Zachary Chitwood suggests the term Macedonian dynasty is \"something of a misnomer\" because of Basil I's Armenian origin. The author of the only dedicated biography of Basil I in English has concluded that it is impossible to be certain what the ethnic origins of the emperor were, though Basil was definitely reliant on the support of Armenians in prominent positions within the Byzantine Empire. == List of rulers == *Basil I the Macedonian (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391') (811\u2013886, ruled 867\u2013886) \u2013 married the Varangian Eudokia Ingerina, mistress of Michael III; died in hunting accident *Leo VI the Wise (\u039b\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03a4') (866\u2013912, ruled 886\u2013912) - son of Eudokia Ingerina, legal son and heir of Basil I; possibly the natural son of Michael III; created church crisis with his fourth marriage -- Zoe Karbonopsina, who took over as regent for their son, Constantine VII, in 914 and ruled the empire until 919 *Alexander III (\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) (870\u2013913, ruled 912\u2013913) - son of Basil I, regent for nephew *Constantine VII the Purple-born (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0396') (905\u2013959, ruled 913\u2013920 and 945-959) - son of Leo VI and Zoe Karbonopsina; married Helena, daughter of Romanos Lekapenos *Romanos I Lekapenos (ruled 920-945); Lekapenos staged a successful coup in 919 and became senior emperor in 920.Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome *Romanos II the Purple-born (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0392') (938\u2013963, ruled 959\u2013963) - son of Constantine VII *Nikephoros II Phokas (\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392' \u03a6\u03c9\u03ba\u1fb6\u03c2) (912\u2013969, ruled 963\u2013969) - successful general, married Romanos II's widow, regent for Basil; assassinated (Origin: Cappadocian) *John I Tzimiskes (\u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391')(925-976, ruled 969\u2013976) - successful general, brother-in-law of Romanos II, lover of Nikephoros's wife but banned from marriage, regent for Basil II and Constantine VIII *Basil II (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392') the Bulgar-slayer (958\u20131025, ruled 976\u20131025) - son of Romanos II *Constantine VIII (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0397') (960-1028, ruled 1025\u20131028) - son of Romanos II; silent co-emperor with Basil II, sole emperor after his brother's death *Zoe (\u0396\u03c9\u03ae) (c. 978\u20131050, ruled 1028\u20131050) - daughter of Constantine VIII *Romanos III Argyros (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0393')(968\u20131034, ruled 1028\u20131034) - eparch of Constantinople; Zoe's first husband, arranged by Constantine VIII; murdered *Michael IV the Paphlagonian (\u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb \u0394') (1010\u20131041, ruled 1034\u20131041) - Zoe's second husband *Michael V the Caulker (\u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb \u0395') (1015\u20131042, ruled 1041\u20131042) - Michael IV's nephew, Zoe's adopted son *Theodora (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1) (980\u20131056, ruled 1042) - daughter of Constantine VIII, co-empress with Zoe *Constantine IX Monomachos (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398') (1000\u20131055, ruled 1042\u20131055) - Zoe's third husband *Theodora (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1) (ruled 1055\u20131056) - restored ===Non-dynastic=== *Michael VI (\u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb \u03a3\u03a4') (ruled 1056\u20131057) - chosen by Theodora; deposed and entered monastery == Family tree == * Basil I the Macedonian (813\u2013886) ** from his marriage to Maria: *** Constantine (865\u2013878), co-emperor with his father *** Anastasia ** from his marriage to empress Eudokia Ingerina: *** Leo VI the Wise (866\u2013912) **** Eudokia (died 892) **** Anna betrothed and married to Louis the Blind **** Basil (died 900) **** Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (905\u2013959), married Helena Lekapene, daughter of Romanos I Lekapenos ***** Romanos II (938\u2013963) married to Bertha, daughter of Hugh of Italy king of Italy ****** childless by his marriage to Bertha of Italy ****** from his marriage to Theophano: ******* Basil II the Bulgar-Slayer (957\u20131025) ******* Constantine VIII (961\u20131028) married Helena, daughter of Alypius ******** Eudokia ******** Zoe (978\u20131050), married: ********# Romanos III Argyros (ca. 968\u20131034) ********# Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1015\u20131042) ********# Constantine IX Monomachos (ca. 1000\u20131055) ******** Theodora (980\u20131056) ******* Anna Porphyrogeneta (963\u20131011), married Vladimir I of Kiev ***** Agathe ***** Theodora, married John I Tzimiskes *** Stephen I (867\u2013893), Patriarch of Constantinople *** Alexander (870\u2013913) ==Genealogy== == See also == * Lekapenos * Phokas (Byzantine family) * Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * ",
