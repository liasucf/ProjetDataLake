Bart Millard, the band's frontman, revealed the meaning of the song in an interview with NewReleaseToday, \"My kids have memorized the album already. Nothing warms your heart more than to hear your kids sing this message. The thing with 'Greater' is that my middle son Charlie is a lot like me. In fact, I went through a lot of grief counseling these past few years. My grief counselor said if I ever want to know what I'm like when in a healthy family to watch Charlie. One day I was trying to tell my son, because he has a stuttering problem, we were talking, and I said, \"Buddy, people may make fun of you, but you have something inside of you that is telling you that you're something different, that you're stronger than that and that you're beautiful. We were at church one day and some kids made of him and he was kind of down. I told him, 'You know what I've told you. That's not them. The enemy may be using them, but these kids are good kids. They're not coming after you, it's just the enemy is taking shots at you. He's taking shots at you because you're something special and he's afraid of something you may do. I've always told him to set his mind on things above, and he started singing this song, 'You are holy, righteous and redeemed.' I just started bawling. From time to time I can hear him singing this song in the house and I've thought that's the reason to make a record.\" ==Composition== \"Greater\" is an Americana track with folk and country elements and some acoustic elements, which has a \"campfire sing-along\" vibe, and this takes a cue from Rend Collective's music. It is originally in the key of D major, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in common time, Millard's vocal range spans from D4 to B5 during the song. ==Commercial performance== \"Greater\" spent 16 weeks at No. 1 on the Christian Airplay chart, and peaked at No. 2 on both the Christian Digital Songs chart and the Christian Songs chart. It also appeared on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart at No. 14 and Heatseekers Songs chart at No. 21. ==Track listing== ;CD release # \"Greater\" # \"Greater (Vocal Demonstration)\" # \"Greater (High Key with Background Vocals)\" # \"Greater (High Key without Background Vocals)\" # \"Greater (Medium Key with Background Vocals)\" # \"Greater (Medium Key without Background Vocals)\" # \"Greater (Low Key with Background Vocals)\" # \"Greater (Low Key without Background Vocals)\" ==Music video== The lyric video of \"Greater\" was published on YouTube on July 11, 2014.
