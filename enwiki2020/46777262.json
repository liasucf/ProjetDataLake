UCT Upper Campus ==Crests & Colours== The club plays with the University of Cape Town Coat of Arms on the left breast of the playing jersey and the UCT Sport logo on the right. The UCT crest was designed in 1859 by Charles Davidson Bell, Surveyor-General of the Cape Colony at the time. Bell was an accomplished artist who also designed medals and the triangular Cape stamp. UCT FC uses the UCT Sport colour palette, with three primary colours: navy blue, sky blue and white. The home kit is traditionally navy blue, while the away strip is predominantly white with sky blue detailing. ==Nickname== The nickname \"Ikey Warriors\" was coined by 2014 Head Coach Rowan Hendricks and Ikey Tigers coach Kevin Musikanth during the 2014 Varsity Football season, due to the team's tenacious warrior-like spirit, tough tackling and never-say-die attitude. It was a nickname used only within the squad, but the media caught onto the name during the tournament, with Soccer Laduma among others writing about UCT's \"Ikey Warriors\". The name became popular among the club and its fans and has since grown into the club's official nickname. For the first time, in 2015, the Ikey Warriors emblem was placed on the back of the playing jersey below the collar. Ikey Warriors Logo ==Stadium== UCT's home ground is the Kopano Astroturf, located on UCT's Lower Campus in Rosebank, Cape Town. The stadium can hold up to 500 spectators at capacity. The astroturf is FIFA approved, and was put on standby as a training facility during the 2010 FIFA World Cup due to its ability to withstand wet weather conditions. The astroturf was resurfed in July 2018. The University of Cape Town were host to the 2018 Western Cape Intervarsity Tournament. https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2018-09-27-inter-varsity-sporting-clash Kopano Astroturf was used for the football fixtures held on Saturday, 28 September, UCT competing with The University of the Western Cape and Stellenbosch University (Maties). Clubs such as Hellenic and ASD Cape Town have used the Kopano Astroturf as their home ground in the ABC Motsepe League in the past. During the 2013 and 2014 Varsity Football tournaments, UCT played their home games on the Groote Schuur Rugby Field, due to its ability to hold a larger number of spectators. ==Honours & Tournament History== ===Varsity Football record=== ;Men *2014 Varsity Football \u2013 8th *2013 Varsity Football \u2013 8th ;Women *2017 Varsity Football \u2013 Semi-finalists 4th http://varsitysportssa.com/uj-way-final-thrashing-uct-4-0// *2016 Varsity Football \u2013 Semi-finalists 4th http://varsitysportssa.com/uwc-one-step-closer- title-big-semi-final-win-cape-derby/ ===USSA Football National Club Championships record=== ;Men *2018 \u2013 Finished 3rd in group stages *2017 \u2013 12th *2016 \u2013 13th *2015 \u2013 Tournament cancelled due to #FeesMustFall protests *2014 \u2013 Did Not Qualify *2013 \u2013 6th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2013results.pdf *2012 \u2013 9th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2012results.pdf *2011 \u2013 Did Not Qualify *2010 \u2013 Did Not Qualify *2009 \u2013 Did Not Qualify ;Women *2018 \u2013 Section B Winners *2017 \u2013 Relegated from Section A *2016 \u2013 8th *2015 \u2013 Tournament cancelled due to #FeesMustFall protests *2014 \u2013 13th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2014results.pdf *2013 \u2013 16th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2013results.pdf *2012 \u2013 15th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2012results.pdf *2011 \u2013 12th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2011results.pdf *2010 \u2013 Did Not Qualify *2009 \u2013 8th http://www.ussa.org.za/doc/Football/football2009results.pdf ==USSA First Team squad 2018== ===Women's Squad=== ===Men's Squad=== ==Club officials== ===Coaching Staff=== ;Men's Technical Team *Head Coach: Jaydon Terblanche *Assistant Coach & 2nd Team Coach: Angelo Julius *Goalkeeper Coach: Mark Kapman *Men's 3rd Team Coach: Storm Johnson *Men's 4th Team Coach: Lindokuhle Skosana and Keenen Christon ;Women's Technical Team *Head Coach: Kamaal Sait *Assistant Coach & 2nd Team Coach: Ahmed Parker *Goalkeeper Coach: Mark Kapman ===Committee=== *Chairperson: Storm Johnson *Vice-Chairperson: Lwazi Ncanana *Secretary General: *Treasurer: *League Coordinator: Nadeem August *Kit & Equipment Manager: Nhlamuselo Ngoveni *Marketing Managers: Lindokuhle Skosana and Kawthar Gierdien *Events Manager: Vincent Mofokeng *Transformation and Outreach: Kateko Boitumelo Pule ==Kit manufacturer== *Kit manufacturer: Laurus ==Former Coaches & Chairpersons== ===Former Head Coaches=== * Cayl Coetsee \u2013 2016 (interim) * Vorgen Less \u2013 2015-2016 * Rowan Hendricks \u2013 2014 * Monwabisi Ralarala \u2013 2012-2013 * Liam Shirley \u2013 2012 ===Former Chairpersons=== * Kateko Boitumelo Pule;\u2013 2017 * Ammar Canani;\u2013 2017 * Warren Black;\u2013 2016 * Daniel Perling \u2013 2014-2016 * Fairouz West \u2013 2013 * Dustin Holohan \u2013 2011-2013 ==References== ==External links== * * Varsity Sports Football * University Sports South Africa Football * South African Football Association Category:Soccer clubs in South Africa Category:University of Cape Town Category:University and college association football clubs Category:Soccer clubs in Cape Town ",
