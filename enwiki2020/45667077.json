The Central Region Army Group, (GERC), was a military formation of the Spanish Republican Army during the last phase of the Spanish Civil War. It gathered the most powerful section of the republican military and would endure until the 1939 surrender. The GERC was under the command of general Jos\u00e9 Miaja Menant, the Defence of Madrid hero. == History == The Central Region Army Group was established on 16 April 1938 by means of an order of the general Staff of the Popular Republican Army. It sought to reorganize the Republican forces following the disastrous campaigns of the Aragon Offensive and the splitting of the Spanish Republican territory in two by the rebel faction. It was initially named \"Group of Armies of the Central-Southern Zone\" (Agrupaci\u00f3n de Ej\u00e9rcitos de la Zona Centro-Sur) before being renamed as Central Region Army Group.Octavio Ruiz Manj\u00f3n-Cabeza (1990); La Segunda Rep\u00fablica y la guerra, p\u00e1g. 588 At the time of its establishment it was composed by four armies, the Andalusian Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Andaluc\u00eda), the Extremaduran Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Extremadura), Central Army (Ej\u00e9rcito del Centro) and Levantine Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Levante), as well as 16 Army corps, 49 divisions and 138 mixed brigades.Octavio Ruiz Manj\u00f3n-Cabeza (1990); La Segunda Rep\u00fablica y la guerra, p\u00e1g. 598 It also included a Coastal Defence brigade and the two anti- aircraft artillery brigades of the Defensa Contra Aeronaves (DCA).J. V. de Leito Aparici (2000); Defensa antia\u00e9rea republicana, 1936-1939: artiller\u00eda y refugios, p\u00e1g. 89 In June the same year, the Eastern Region Army Group Grupo de Ej\u00e9rcitos de la Regi\u00f3n Oriental (GERO) would be established as well. In December 1938 the GERC was scheduled to take part in General Vicente Rojo Lluch's \"Plan P\", an ambitious project of an offensive campaign in Extremadura that would have taken place at the same time as a disembarkment within the enemy lines in Motril, along with diversionary attacks in other places of Andalusia and the Madrid Front. However, in the face of the opposition of General Miaja and other Republican commanders to the implementation of the whole plan, it was not carried out to its full extent and the only action taken was the Battle of Valsequillo which resulted in failure shortly before having been initiated.Hugh Thomas (1976); La Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola, pp. 932-935 Following the fall of Catalonia in February, on 2 March 1939 President Juan Negr\u00edn arranged for a reorganization of the Republican Armed Forces in the Central Zone, decreeing the disbandment of the GERC, as well as a reorganization of the command structure.\u00c1ngel Bahamonde Magro et al (2000); As\u00ed termin\u00f3 la Guerra de Espa\u00f1a, p\u00e1g. 341 However, Segismundo Casado's coup that took place a few days later would hinder the implementation of these eleventh-hour measures. ==Structure== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Army Corps || DivisionsCarlos Engel, p.253 || Sectors |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color:#999;\" align=\"center\" | Central Army |-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #999;\" |- | I Army Corps || 1st, 2nd & 69th || Guadarrama - Somosierra |- | II Army Corps || 4th, 7th & 65th || Las Rozas - Usera - Carabanchel |- | III Army Corps || 9th, 15th & 18th || Jarama-Aranjuez |- | IV Army Corps || 12th, 17th & 33rd || Guadalajara - Montes Universales |- | VI Army Corps || 5th, 10th & 8th || Tajo - Jarama |- | Fourteenth Guerrilla Army CorpsMichael Alpert, p. 391 || - || Rear guard |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#999;\" align=\"center\" | Extremaduran Army |-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #999;\" |- | VII Army Corps || 36th & 37th || Algodor - Z\u00fajar |- | VIII Army Corps || 38th, 63rd & 51st || Z\u00fajar - Guadalmellato |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color:#999;\" align=\"center\" | Andalusian Army |-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #999;\" |- | IX Army Corps || 20th, 21st & 54th || C\u00f3rdoba - Ja\u00e9n |- | XXIII Army Corps || 23rd & 71st || Granada - Almer\u00eda |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#999;\" align=\"center\" | Levantine Army |-style=\"border-top:solid 3px #999;\" |- | XIII Army Corps || 28th & 65th || Montes Universales - Albarrac\u00edn |- | XVI Army Corps || 39th & 48th || Levante |- | XVII Army CorpsAntony Beevor, p.486 || 19th, 40th & 25th || Levante |- | XIX Army Corps || 64th & 66th || Levante |- | XX Army Corps || 49th & 53rd & C || Levante |- | XXI Army Corps || 68th, 52nd & 6th || Espad\u00e1n |- | XXII Army Corps || 47th, 70th & 41st || Levante |} ==See also== *Spanish Civil War, 1938\u201339 *Final offensive of the Spanish Civil War *Eastern Region Army Group Grupo de Ej\u00e9rcitos de la Regi\u00f3n Oriental (GERO) == References == == Bibliography == * Alpert, Michael (1989); El Ej\u00e9rcito Republicano en la Guerra Civil, Siglo XXI de Espa\u00f1a, Madrid. * Engel Masoliver, Carlos (1999); Historia de las Brigadas mixtas del Ej\u00e9rcito popular de la Rep\u00fablica, 1936-1939, Editorial Almena, Madrid, 1999 . * * Salas Larraz\u00e1bal, Ram\u00f3n (2006); Historia del Ej\u00e9rcito Popular de la Rep\u00fablica.
