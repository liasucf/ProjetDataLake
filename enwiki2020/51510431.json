Since the church was built in the honor of Maria Tutta Santa, Panaghia would be best translated as \"All Saint\". == Description == The church was built in the 11th century; it has got just one nave and an apse with a mullioned window. Inside the church, there are two frescoes: one picturing Basil of Caesarea and the other (14th century) John Chrysostom. == History == In October 2017, the Panaghia church exhibited images from the Connected Open Heritage, a project led by Wikimedia Italia in collaboration with Wikimedia Sweden and UNESCO. ==References== Category:11th-century establishments in Italy Panaghia ",
