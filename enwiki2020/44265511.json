    "text": "Parmelia saxatilis, commonly known as the salted shield lichen or crottle, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. ==Description== It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus with the name Lichen saxatilis. Erik Acharius transferred it to Parmelia in 1803. The lichen has a greenish-gray to bluish-gray thallus that can turn brown in exposed locations. It typically grows on rock, although it is sometimes found on bark or wood. Parmelia saxatilis is used to make dyes with deep red-brown and rusty-orange colors. Known as \"crotal\" in Scotland, it was used to dye traditional cloths including Harris tweed.Fraser, Jean: Traditional Scottish Dyes, Canongate, 1983J.C.T.
