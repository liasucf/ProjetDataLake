The fans virtually travelled to what the organisers have christened Volleyplanet as more than 1,600 people took part in the Opening Ceremony of EuroVolley 2017. Two bands, one popular duo, and as many as 180 dancers, 120 adults and 60 children, performed live to deliver something truly unprecedented in European Volleyball history. It was a tribute to Poland, but especially to Volleyball as more than 65,000 people all dressed in their white-and-red outfits celebrated the sport, thus confirming the status of Poland as Volleyland. ==Pool standing procedure== # Number of matches won # Match points # Sets ratio # Points ratio # Result of the last match between the tied teams Match won 3\u20130 or 3\u20131: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser Match won 3\u20132: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser ==Preliminary round== All times are local Central European Summer Time (UTC+2). ===Pool A=== |} ===Pool B=== |} ===Pool C=== |} ===Pool D=== |} ==Championship round== ===Bracket=== ===Playoffs=== |} ===Quarterfinals=== |} ===Semifinals=== |} ===Third place game=== |} ===Final=== |} ==Final standing== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=40|Rank !width=180|Team |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- | |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |4 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |5 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |6 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |7 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |8 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |9 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |10 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |11 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |12 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |13 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |15 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |16 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |} {| style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:2em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\" |- |14\u2013man Roster |- |Ilia Vlasov, Artem Volvich, Sergey Grankin (c), Dmitry Volkov, Yury Berezhko, Andrey Ashchev, Aleksandr Butko, Egor Feoktistov, Maksim Zhigalov, Maxim Mikhaylov, Egor Kliuka, Ilyas Kurkaev, Valentin Golubev, Roman Martynyuk |- |Head Coach |- |Sergey Shlyapnikov |} ==Awards== *Most Valuable Player : Maxim Mikhaylov *Best Setter : Sergey Grankin *Best Outside Spikers : Denys Kaliberda : Dmitry Volkov *Best Middle Blockers : Sre\u0107ko Lisinac : Marcus B\u00f6hme *Best Opposite Spiker : Gy\u00f6rgy Grozer *Best Libero : Lowie Steuer ==See also== *2017 Women's European Volleyball Championship ==References== ==External links== *Official website 2017 2017 Men's European Volleyball Championship Men's European Volleyball Championship European Volleyball Championship Category:Sports competitions in Gda\u0144sk Category:Sport in Sopot Category:Sport in Szczecin Category:Sports competitions in Katowice Category:Sports competitions in Krak\u00f3w Category:August 2017 sports events in Europe Category:September 2017 sports events in Europe Category:21st century in Krak\u00f3w Category:21st century in Katowice Category:2010s in Warsaw Category:Sports competitions in Warsaw Category:21st century in Gda\u0144sk ",
