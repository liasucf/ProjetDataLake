It is run over a distance of 1 mile, 3 furlongs and 75 yards () at Chester in May. ==History== The event was established in 1950, and it was originally contested over 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 53 yards. The inaugural running was won by Requete. The Cheshire Oaks was extended by several yards in 1970. It held Group 3 status from 1971 to 1985. It was relegated to Listed level in 1986. The race was scheduled to be run over 1 mile, 4 furlongs and 65 yards in 1988, but it was abandoned due to waterlogging. It was cut by about a furlong in 1989. The current trophy is named in memory of Robert Sangster (1936\u20132004), a successful owner-breeder of racehorses. The Robert Sangster Memorial Cup was first presented in 2005. The Cheshire Oaks can serve as a trial for the Epsom Oaks. The last horse to win both races was Enable in 2017. The last participant to win the Oaks was Forever Together, the 2018 runner-up. ==Records== Leading jockey since 1960 (6 wins): * Pat Eddery \u2013 One Over Parr (1975), African Dancer (1976), Braiswick (1989), Peplum (1991), Bolas (1994), Valentine Girl (1999) Leading trainer since 1960 (7 wins): * Barry Hills \u2013 Dibidale (1974), Chaudennay (1987), Aquamarine (1992), Bolas (1994), High and Low (1998), Valentine Girl (1999), Alumni (2005) ==Winners since 1980== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" !
