    "text": "\"Somebody's Been Sleeping\" is a 1969 song recorded by American funk and soul group 100 Proof (Aged In Soul). ==Background== Songwriting-production team Holland-Dozier-Holland had left Motown Records in 1967 over a dispute about royalties, and set up their own label, Hot Wax/Invictus, shortly after. They put together 100 Proof as a funk and soul act for their new label. Joe Stubbs, formerly of Motown groups The Contours and The Originals, was made co-lead singer, along with Steve Mancha (who provides lead vocals on this track). ==Details== Written by General Johnson (lead singer of Chairmen Of The Board), Angelo Bond, and Greg Perry (who also acted as producer), the song depicts a cheated lover discovering evidence of his woman's infidelity, quoting liberally from the folk tale \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". Released as 100 Proof's second single, it became a Top Ten hit on the US pop chart, reaching #8 in 1970, and performed even better on the R&B; chart, making it to #6. Although the group would continue to score R&B; hits up until their break-up in 1973, none of their singles reached the same level of success. \"Somebody's Been Sleeping\" also sold over a million copies and was certified gold by the RIAA.
