In return, the British agreed to pension off their prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Raghunath Rao, and acknowledge Madhavrao II as peshwa of the Maratha Empire. The British also recognised the territorial claims of the Mahadji Shinde west of the Jumna River and all the territories occupied by the British after the Treaty of Purndar were given back to the Othas.
