    "text": "Neelipleona is a name given to some hexapods of the subclass Collembola (springtails). While their taxonomic rank remains broadly settled as family Neelidae, Neelipleona has been described at order or suborder rank. ==Taxonomic rank== Many authors consider the \"Neelipleona\" Symphypleona of the superfamily Sminthuroidea, family Neelidae.See references in Haaramo (2008) However, in other accounts, Neelipleona are either a distinct order from the three less controversial Springtail orders (Entomobryomorpha, Poduromorpha and Symphypleona) or a distinct suborder of Symphypleona, or placed in the Entomobryomorpha. ==References== ==Footnotes== Category:Collembola ",
