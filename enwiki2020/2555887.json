The Battle of Ma\u0142ogoszcz. one of the biggest battles of the 1863 January Uprising, took place there. Ma\u0142ogoszcz belongs to Lesser Poland; the name of the town comes from ancient Polish given name Ma\u0142ogost. Ma\u0142ogoszcz was founded in the early days of the Polish statehood as a settlement located at the intersection of medieval merchant routes. First mention of the village, which at that time was home to a castellan, comes from a papal bull of 1136. In the 12th century Ma\u0142ogoszcz was a local trade and administrative center. Ma\u0142ogost, as it was called, was frequently visited by Polish princes and kings. In 1140, Duchess of Poland Salomea of Berg came here, and in 1273 - Princess Kinga of Poland. In 1259, the gord was destroyed in a Mongol raid. In the 14th century, King Kazimierz Wielki built defensive fortifications here. In 1408 Ma\u0142ogoszcz was incorporated as a town, upon order of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o. In June 1582, King Stefan Batory spent a night here on his way to Warsaw for his crowning. Ma\u0142ogoszcz prospered in the 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1591-1595 a Baroque church was built, and the town emerged as a center of cloth making. Before catastrophic Swedish invasion (the Deluge, 1655 - 1660), the town had 180 houses and the population of 1,200. By 1660, the population was reduced to 700. Until 1795 (see Partition of Poland), Ma\u0142ogoszcz remained part of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship. In June 1794, during the Kosciuszko Uprising, Tadeusz Kosciuszko rested here after the Battle of Szczekociny. On February 24, 1863, one of the biggest battles of the January Uprising, the Battle of Ma\u0142ogoszcz, took place there. The headquarters of General Marian Langiewicz was located in a local parish church complex, and the \u0141oso\u015bna river' name was later changed into Wierna Rzeka (Faithful River). As a punishment, in 1869 the Russians demoted Ma\u0142ogoszcz to the status of a village. In 1904 a great fire destroyed large parts of it, and the village was completely destroyed in 1914 - 1915, when the Russian - Austro/German frontline remained here for several months. Ma\u0142ogoszcz recovered its town rights in 1996. Among points of interest there is the parish church (1591-1595), Renaissance parish complex, a cemetery chapel (1595), and a monument of Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko (1917). ==Sport== * Wierna Ma\u0142ogoszcz - football club ==External links== * Official website Category:Cities and towns in \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship Category:J\u0119drzej\u00f3w County Category:Sandomierz Voivodeship Category:Kielce Governorate Category:Kielce Voivodeship (1919\u20131939) ",
