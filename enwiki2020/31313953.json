The word Ara\u00e7oiaba in the Tupi language means \"place where the sun goes down\" or \"hiding from the sun,\" since the word Ipanema means \"bad water\".

It is surrounded by the municipalities of Sorocaba, Iper\u00f3, Ara\u00e7oiaba da Serra, and Capela do Alto that are situated an average elevation of 600 m. It is noteworthy, therefore, focus on local and regional geology shows that it is an intrusion of igneous rocks of ultrabasic-alkaline nature of the Mesozoic era (123 million years), who crossed the sedimentary rocks of the Paran\u00e1 Basin in an area with typical geomorphology of the Peripheral Depression, Zone of the Middle Tiet\u00ea river. Today rocks present there are remnants of an ancient volcano, so in the past, Ipanema Hill was a legitimate volcano. The intrusion event half rose Itarar\u00e9 Subgroup sandstones and crystalline basement rocks also. The geomorphological feature of the hill is also called \"Horst D\u00f4mico de Ara\u00e7oiaba da Serra.\" There fenitization process by alkaline rocks of the intrusion and a significant radial dyke system surrounding the intrusion, with a few tens of kilometers long. There is a rich history linked to the Ipanema Hill. The site was the scene of the construction of the first iron foundry in Brazil, Royal St. John of Ipanema Iron Foundry, currently marking its 200th anniversary.http://www.sorocaba.com.br/enciclopediasorocabana/index.php/index.php?local=titulos&tipo;=verbetes&ler;=1093319370 Real Iron Factory St. John St. John of Ipanema - Encyclopedia Sorocabana There are also mystical stories, like the monk from Ipanema.http://www.sorocaba.com.br/enciclopediasorocabana/index.php/index.php?local=titulos&tipo;=verbetes&ler;=1093319370 The monk from Ipanema The area is part of the National Forest of Ipanema - \"Flona\", an environmental conservation unit established in 1992 and administered by the IBAMA.

In the Piedmont region is the location of Varnhagen ville, with the architectural and Ipanema Iron Foundry, Ipanema Farm, where she ran CENEA, National Center for Agricultural Engineering, carrying out agricultural research and agricultural aviation school. The old railroad Sorocabana - EFS intersects the portion of the east and north of the hill and has a train station in hagen, whose current building was built in 1928.http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/v/varnhagen.htm Varnhagem Station - Railway Sorocabana - EFS In high Ipanema Hill there is a monument to Varnhagen, visited by Royal Family on November 11, 1884. Another monument is called a Cross Holy Cross Stone.
