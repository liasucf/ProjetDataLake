WAAAM is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization committed to the preservation of, and education about aviation, automobile, and other historic transportation- related relics. WAAAM is open to the public every day 9:00-5:00 except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. WAAAM has special activities the second Saturday of every month. The museum features flying demonstrations, auto demonstrations, and restoration demonstrations, though events vary month to month. The museum's biggest event is the annual Hood River Fly-In held the first weekend after Labor Day every year, and features antique aircraft and automobiles from throughout North America. WAAAM Fly-In morning ==History== The museum was formed as a 501(c) organization in 2006, by collector Terry Brandt and opened in 2007, in a building. The museum was started with 42 airplanes donated by Brandt and 20 automobiles. As of September 2010, the museum totaled 75 airplanes and in excess of 100 automobiles. About 55 of the airplanes were still able to fly at that time. In 2009, a second hangar was added to display the collection, and a third was built in 2013. A fourth addition was added November 2016. The collection in 2016 totals over 315 vehicles. ==Collections== ===Antique airplanes=== WAAAM boasts a large flying collection of OX-5-powered airplanes, and the largest collection of three- cylinder, radial-powered airplanes.
