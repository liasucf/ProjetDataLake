He is primarily known as a sculptor, but also produced paintings and lithographs.Zadkine Research Center ==Early years and education== Zadkine was born on 28 January 1888 as Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin () in the city of Vitsebsk, part of the Russian Empire (now Belarus). Archival materials reported in this article state that Iosel-Shmuila Aronovich Tsadkin, was of Jewish faith and studied in the Vitebsk City Technical School between 1900 and 1904, including two years in one class with would-be artists Marc Chagall (then Movsha Shagal) and Victor Mekler (then Avigdor Mekler). Thus, contrary to what Zadkine himself was saying, his father did not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion and his mother was not of a Scottish extraction. He was born to a Jewish father and a mother named Zippa-Dvoyra, who he claimed to be of Scottish origin. Ossip had 5 siblings: sisters Mira, Roza and Fania and brothers Mark and Moses. At the age of fifteen, Zadkine was sent by his father to Sunderland to learn English and \u2018good manners\u2019. He then moved to London and attended lessons at the Regent Street Polytechnic where he considered the teachers to be too conservative. Zadkine settled in Paris in 1910. He studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for six months. In 1911 he lived and worked in La Ruche. While in Paris he joined the Cubist movement, working in a Cubist idiom from 1914 to 1925. He later developed his own style, one that was strongly influenced by African and Greek art. == Career == In 1921 he obtained French citizenship.Ossip Joselyn Zadkine Facts, YourDictionary Zadkine served as a stretcher-bearer in the French Army during World War I, and was wounded in action. He spent World War II in the US. His best-known work is probably the sculpture The Destroyed City (1951-1953), representing a man without a heart, a memorial to the destruction of the center of the Dutch city of Rotterdam in 1940 by the Nazi-German Luftwaffe. He taught sculpture classes at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re until 1958, students of his included artists Geula Dagan (1925\u20132008) and Genevieve Pezet. == Death and legacy == Zadkine died in Paris in 1967 at the age of 79 after undergoing abdominal surgery and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. === Museums === His former home and studio in Montparnasse is now the Mus\u00e9e Zadkine. When his former wife Prax died, she donated the house and art studio to the City of Paris for the formation of Mus\u00e9e Zadkine. There is also a Mus\u00e9e Zadkine in the village of Les Arques in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region of France. Zadkine lived in Les Arques for a number of years, and while there, carved an enormous Christ on the Cross and Pieta that are featured in the 12th-century church which stands opposite the museum. ==Personal life== In August 1920, Zadkine married Valentine Prax (1897\u20131981), an Algerian-born painter of Sicilian and French-Catalan descent. Prax and Zadkine had no children. Zadkine was a neighbor in Montparnasse and a friend of Henry Miller and he was represented by the character \"Borowski\" in Miller's novel, Tropic of Cancer (1934).Frederick Turner: Renegade: Henry Miller and the Making of \"Tropic of Cancer\", Yale University Press, 2012. His other neighbors there included; Chaim Soutine, and Tsuguharu Foujita. While living in exile during wartime in Manhattan from 1942 to 1945, Zadkine had a relationship with American artist Carol Janeway and he created several portraits of her. The artist's only child, Nicolas Hasle (born 1960), was the result of his affair with a Danish woman, Annelise Hasle. Since 2009, Hasle, a psychiatrist, who had been acknowledged by the artist and had his parentage legally established in France in the 1980s, has been party to a lawsuit with the City of Paris to establish his claim to his father's estate. ==Awards== *1950 Venice Biennale sculpture prize *1961 Grand Prix National des Arts ==Legacy== * A school in Rotterdam was named after ZadkineZadkine college, as part of their training they even have Zadkine airlines.Zadkine Airlines Rotterdam ==Gallery== File:Ossip Zadkine, 1913, Maternit\u00e9, painted elmwood, 81 cm, exhibited Salon des Independants, Paris, 1914 Published in Montjolie, 1914.jpg|Maternit\u00e9, 1913,painted elmwood, 81 cm, exhibited at the 1914 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, Paris, Published in Montjoie, 1914 File:Ossip Zadkine, 1918, Femme au violon (Woman with a Violin).jpg|Femme au violon (Woman with a Violin), 1918 photograph by Pierre Choumoff File:Ossip Zadkine, 1920, Venus.jpg|Venus, 1920, published in Action: Cahiers individualistes de philosophie et d'art, Volume 1, Number 4, July 1920 File:Beeldentuin Museum de Fundatie Heino (7285997756).jpg|Sundial, 1929, bronze sculpture, Museum de Fundatie, castle Heino, Netherlands File:Mus\u00e9e Zadkine - Entr\u00e9e de l'atelier.jpg|Prometheus, c. 1930\u20131940, wooden sculpture File:Ossip Zadkine Skulptur - Die Gefangenen (2).jpg|The prisoners (Die Gefangenen), 1943, bronze sculpture File:Rotterdam zadkine monument.jpg|The Destroyed City (De Verwoeste Stad), 1951\u201353, bronze sculpture in Rotterdam, which is now a registered monument.Rijksmonumenten File:Ossip Zadkine-Grosser Orpheus.jpg|Orpheus, 1956, bronze sculpture File:'Lotophage', bronze sculpture by Ossip Zadkine, 1961-1962, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|Lotophage, 1961\u201362, bronze sculpture, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv File:P1040677Beeld Vincent en Theo van Gogh.JPG|Vincent and Theo van Gogh, 1963\u201364, bronze sculpture, in Zundert, The Netherlands File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Maison Blomme - 07.jpg|Bas-relief of the Blomme House in Brussels representing the architect's instruments. ==Public collections== Among the public collections holding works by Ossip Zadkine are: * Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands * Museum de Fundatie, Zwolle, Netherlands * Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel * Mus\u00e9e Zadkine ==See also== * Mus\u00e9e Zadkine * Rue Zadkine ==References== * Czwiklitzer, Christophe, Ossip Zadkine, le sculpteur-graveure de 1919 \u00e0 1967, Paris, Chez l'auteur, 1967. * Yamanashi Kenritsu Bijutsukan, Ossip Zadkine, Tokyo, Yomiuri Shinbunsha, 1989. * Andreas Weiland, \"(Re-)Discovering Zadkine\", in: Art in Society, issue # 10 ==External links== * Zadkine Research Center * * Zadkine Museum in Paris * Zadkine Museum in Les Arques * Category:1888 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Belarusian sculptors Category:20th-century Russian sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:Russian male sculptors Category:Modern sculptors Category:Jewish sculptors Category:Russian Jews Category:French people of Belarusian-Jewish descent Category:Russian people of Scottish descent Category:Belarusian people of British descent Category:French people of Scottish descent Category:Alumni of Chelsea College of Arts Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery Category:School of Paris Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to France Category:20th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors ",
