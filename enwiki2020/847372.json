    "text": "Mynachdy () is a district of the city of Cardiff, Wales. Mynachdy is situated between Gabalfa, Birchgrove and Cathays. Mynachdy is often paired with neighbouring Gabalfa, and shares its councillors. It is close to a few universities such as Cardiff University and the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, as well as student accommodation. == Name == The word \"mynachdy\" comes from the Welsh words \"mynach\" (monk) and \"t\u0177\" (house). This probably refers to Llys Talybont, a manor building in the modern area of Mynachdy that was owned by the monks of Llantarnam Abbey. == Mynachdy Institute == The Mynachdy Institute is a community centre in Mynachdy. There have been many threats of closure, with plans to replace it with student flats. However, after its initial closure, a successful community movement regained control of the Institute from Cardiff Council. == Transport == The A470 North Road runs along Mynachdy's northeast side. Mynachdy is bordered on its southwest side by a local railway line. There are plans under consideration to build the Gabalfa railway station on this line to serve Mynachdy and neighbouring Gabalfa. == References == Category:Districts of Cardiff ",
