    "text": "Jefferson Fernandes Luiz (November 12, 1978 \u2013 April 19, 2019), better known by his stage name MC Sap\u00e3o or simply as Sap\u00e3o, was a Brazilian singer-songwriter who reached fame in the mid-2000s with the hits \"Diretoria\" and \"Eu T\u00f4 Tranquil\u00e3o\". ==Biography== Sap\u00e3o performing in 2010 Jefferson Fernandes Luiz was born on November 12, 1978 at the Alem\u00e3o favela complex in Rio de Janeiro. His nickname, \"Sap\u00e3o\" (roughly translated to English as \"big frog\"), which he had since he was young, came from his portly figure and bulging eyes, which gave him the appearance of a frog. He worked at a tire shop, as a doorman for a daycare and as a delivery boy for a flower shop \u2013 and later for a restaurant \u2013 prior to his musical career. In 1998 he was arrested by the police due to alleged drug trafficking, being released after eight months due to lack of evidence; while in prison he wrote his first song, \"Eu Sei Cantar\", which he dedicated to his mother, promising her he would \"use his talents for good\" after being released. (In 2006, however, another controversy between Sap\u00e3o and the police ensued after he allegedly took part in a proibid\u00e3o funk by MC Colibri, also arrested under suspicions of drug trafficking and crime apology.) Sap\u00e3o then continued to write songs but only began his career officially in 2005, recording the song \"Diretoria\", which catapulted him into fame after extensive airplay in radio stations of Rio de Janeiro. The following year he released his greatest hit, \"Eu T\u00f4 Tranquil\u00e3o\", and he subsequently began to appear in DJ Marlboro-produced compilations and performing in shows nationwide. By the 2010s, collaborations with DJ Tom and sertanejo universit\u00e1rio duo Jo\u00e3o Neto & Frederico also ensued. In 2012 he released the song \"Rei do Baile\", which was re-recorded in 2015 featuring guest appearances by Mr. Catra and MC Guim\u00ea. A music video was made for the song, with a budget of R$200,000.00. In 2013 his song \"Classe A\" was included in the soundtrack of the 21st season of long-running soap opera Malha\u00e7\u00e3o. Sap\u00e3o was also notable for performing at wedding parties, with his most remarkable one being at the marriage of actors Bruno Gagliasso and Giovanna Ewbank in 2010. ===Health issues and death=== Sap\u00e3o always had health issues owing to his obesity (as an adult he weighed 160 kilos, or 352 pounds); diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, in 2013 he was forced to lose 50 kilos (110 pounds), claiming he would \"die\" if he did not do so. On April 10, 2019, he was hospitalized due to a severe case of pneumonia, dying nine days later, on April 19, at the age of 40. He was buried one day later at the Caju Cemetery in Rio, and was survived by his wife Alessandra and four children. His scheduled performance at Rock in Rio 8 was subsequently cancelled. ==Influences== Sap\u00e3o stated in a 2015 interview that his musical style was mostly influenced by American funk, soul and pop artists such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles and Lionel Richie. ==Discography== ===Compilations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
