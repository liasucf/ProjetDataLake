Safiqoli Khan also served for some time as Divan-beigi (chancellor, chief justice). Safiqoli had a son named Rostam, another high-ranking Saakadze figure, and a namesake to Safiqoli's father. ==Sources== * * * * * Category:1679 deaths Category:Safavid governors of Erivan Category:Safavid governors of Mashhad Category:Iranian people of Georgian descent Category:Shia Muslims from Georgia (country) Category:Safavid generals Category:Ghilman Category:17th-century people of the Safavid Empire Category:Divan-beigi ",
