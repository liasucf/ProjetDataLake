    "text": "Borpatragohain was the third of the three great Gohains (counsellors) in the Ahom kingdom. This position was created by Suhungmung Dihingia Raja in the year 1527 when Koncheng was made the first Borpatrogohain. \"Thaomung-mungteu Klangseng was made Chao-sheng-lung(Borpatrogohain) in Lakni Rungrao 1527.\"] The designation was probably borrowed from Habungadhipati Vrihat-patra, a Chutia chief dependent on the Chutiya king, \"It appears that the novel designation of Barpatragohain was borrowed from the civil list of Habung where the local ruler, a dependent of the Chutiya king, had the title of Vrhat- Patra.\" \"Chutiyar bora-borukor lekha : Toktoru 1, Kaitara 1, Chuluki Chetia 1, Borpatra 1(The chiefs of the Chutias were Toktoru, Koitara, Chuluki Chetia and Borpatra).\"As per the section Chutiyar Daman, Ahom Buranji(SK) p.25, during the rule of Suklenmung, a Brahmin chief and a Chutia Borpatra rebelled against the Ahom king. The Borpatra was killed and the Brahmin fled to Behar(probably Koch-Bihar) in the west. as Klangseng (previously posted as Bhatialia Gohain in the year 1526) \"In Lakni Khutsan(1526), the heavenly king created Klangseng of Dhanudharia(Chao-seng-kung-riun) family, Bhatialia Gohain(Thao-mung Mung-teu) and stationed him at Habung\". was stationed at Habung. \"Thao-mung mungteu(Bhatialia Gohain) was made Chao-sheng-lung in Lakni Rungrao 1527.\" The other two ministers, the Burhagohain and the Borgohain, strongly opposed the creation of this office, but the king successfully instituted this by claiming that three ministers are now required to stabilize the kingdom. Suhungmung claimed that Klangseng, a formidable warrior but of doubtful pedigree, was his half-brother who grew up in a Naga chieftain's house. \"The third counsellor so appointed, being of dubious pedigree, was publicly claimed by the king to be his own half-brother, posthumously born to a banished queen in a Naga chief's house.\" In later times, people from non- Ahoms families, like those of Garhgayan Patar and Maran Patar were also made Borpatragohain in later times. and administered the region from the Dafala hills to the Brahmaputra, and between the Gerelua and Pichalua rivers. ==List of Borpatragohains== * Klang-seng * Klan-Jang * Ban Jangi * Laku Borpatragohain * Banchangia Borpatragohain * Lai Borpatragohain * Chereli Borpatragohain * Bhaga Borpatragohain * Achuk Borpatragohain * Kenduguria Sengkong Borpatragohain * Paramananda Borpatragohain * Harinath Borpatragohain * Redeshwar Borpatragohain * Maran Borpatragohain * Kenduguria Rudresvar Borpatragohain ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Gait, Edward (1905) History of Assam, Calcutta * Barua, S L (1993) Last Days of Ahom Monarchy, New Delhi * * * Category: Assamese-language surnames ",
