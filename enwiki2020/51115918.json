Schlossberg has two younger siblings, Tatiana and Jack. Schlossberg's mother is a Catholic of Irish, French, Scottish, and English descent, while her father comes from an Orthodox Jewish family of Ukrainian descent. She was raised in her mother's religion, but also observes Jewish traditions, holidays and holy days. During her early childhood, Schlossberg attended Brearley School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Heymann, 2007, p. 359. In first grade, she went on a school field trip to the American Museum of Natural History accompanied by her grandmother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. \"She was the only grandparent in the group,\" said a father whose daughter was in the same class as Schlossberg. In 1999, Schlossberg's uncle John F. Kennedy Jr., with whom she was close, died in a plane crash. === Education === In 2006, Schlossberg enrolled at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts where she earned a bachelor's degree in English studies, attended film courses, and became interested in fashion.

The series follows two twentysomething young women, Bee (portrayed by Schlossberg) and Lara (portrayed by Nelson-Greenberg), as they give women comic tips to surviving the apocalypse. \"It came up as a response to seeing the way that New York City responded to Hurricane Sandy, and how people were grossly underprepared \u2013 specifically, girls in damsel in distress mode,\" Schlossberg told Mashable. \"I thought it would be interesting to create this world where girls have to be survivalists without compromising their cute factor.\" == Politics == During the 2008 United States presidential election, Schlossberg donated to Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and volunteered for Democrat Alan Khazei's campaign for the United States Senate in the 2010 special election in Massachusetts. == References == == External links == *End Time Girls Club web television series official website, in which Schlossberg portrays main character Bee.
