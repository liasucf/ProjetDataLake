It is located in the province of J\u00e4mtland in modern J\u00e4mtland County. From Storsj\u00f6n runs the river Indals\u00e4lven and the lake contains the major island Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n. The city of \u00d6stersund is located on the east shore of the lake, opposite Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n. Storsj\u00f6n is said to be the home of Storsj\u00f6odjuret, a cryptid lake monster not unlike the Loch Ness Monster, and every now and then there are new reports of people having spotted it. Descriptions of the creature have varied over the years. Some have described it as being serpentine in appearance, with multiple humps, a feline or canine- like head and grayish skin. Others have claimed that the creature is short in stature and morbidly obese, with a roundish skull. The ferry company V\u00e4gverket F\u00e4rjerederiethttp://farjerederiet.se/ (run by the Swedish Road Authority) provides two ferry lines crossing the lake, one from Norder\u00f6n to H\u00e5kansta and one from Is\u00f6n to Norder\u00f6n. They are replaced by ice roads during the winter, usually January\u2013April.http://www.turist.ostersund.se/parser.php?did=55:1002 == See also == * Storsj\u00f6odjuret * Lakes of Sweden ==References== ==External links== * * Map of Storsj\u00f6n Category:Lakes of J\u00e4mtland County ",
