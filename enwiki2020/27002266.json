    "text": "Bragod is a duo giving historically informed performances of mediaeval Welsh music.North Atlantic Fiddle Convention page about Bragod The members are Robert Evans and Mary-Anne Roberts. Their music ranges over a very wide timescale, from verses from the early medieval poem Y Gododdin to 19th century songs. Robert Evans plays the crwth and the six-stringed lyre, while Mary-Anne Roberts sings with a distinctive rather buzzing style. They use Pythagorean tuning. Their interpretation of the older music is based on Evans's research on the Robert ap Huw Manuscript in the British Library. The pair released a self-published album, Kaingk, on 30 November 2005. Various tracks from the album have received airplay by BBC Radio 3 during their Late Junction programme. ==References== ==External links== *Website of Bragod * Robert Evans and Mary-Anne Roberts discuss the performance of Welsh bardic music * * Photograph of Bragod Category:Welsh musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Wales ",
