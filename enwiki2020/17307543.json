Aror once served as the capital of Sindh. == History == As Roruka, capital of the Sauvira Kingdom, it is mentioned as an important trading center in early Buddhist literature.Derryl N. MacLean (1989), Religion and Society in Arab Sind, p.63 Little is known about the city's history prior to the Arab invasion in the 8th century CE. Aror was the capital of the Ror Dynasty, which was followed by Rai Dynasty and then the Brahman Dynasty that once ruled northern Sindh. Aror is the ancestral town of the Arora Community. In 711, Aror was captured by the army of Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim. Arab historians recorded the city's name as Al-rur, Al-ruhr and Al Ror.\"Alor or Aror of the Muslims is really Al Ror which is the same as Roruka or Roruva, the name of the ancient Sauvira capital\", Page 45, History of the Punjab, Volume 1 by Fauja Singh, Published by the Department of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University, 1977 In 962 it was hit by a massive earthquake that changed the course of the Indus River and ruined the town's mud brick building, thereby setting into play the city's decline, and eventual re- settlement at Rohri, along the modern-day shores of the Indus. ==Ruins== Most of Aror's ruins have been lost, though some arches of a mosque built shortly after the 8th century Arab invasion remain standing. The Kalka Cave Temple, Hindu temple dedicated to Kalkaan Devi still exists near the ruins, and are still used. The Chattan Shah ji Takri shrine is built atop a high rock outside the city, and is traditionally believed to be a companion of Ali, cousin of the Prophet Muhammad. ==See also== * Aror University of Art, Architecture, Design and Heritages * Rohri * Muhammad bin Qasim ath-Thaqaf\u012b ==References== Category:Sukkur District Category:History of Pakistan Category:History of Sindh Category:Chach Nama ",
