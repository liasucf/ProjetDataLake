    "text": "Kevin Sundher (born January 18, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who currently plays for the Allen Americans of the ECHL. He previously played in the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Czech Extraliga. Sundher was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== On December 15, 2011, Sundher was signed to a three- year entry-level contract with the Buffalo Sabres. He was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans for the duration of his contract. As a free agent and with little NHL interest, Sundher opted to sign a one-year contract in the ECHL with the Reading Royals on September 22, 2015. His season was ultimately shortened by a leg injury he suffered while playing for the AHL's Lehigh Valley Phantoms on a professional tryout. He signed an AHL contract with the Phantoms on August 16, 2016, but spent most of the season in Reading before being released from his contract so he could sign for the remainder of the season with HC Olomouc of the Czech Extraliga. Sundher signed an extension to remain with HC Olomouc for the 2017\u201318 season. He again made a midseason team change, being released by HC Olomouc and signing with the Sparta Warriors of the Norwegian GET-ligaen on January 15, 2018. In the off- season he opted to return to North America by signing a contract with the ECHL's Allen Americans for the 2018\u201319 season. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"96\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"96\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
