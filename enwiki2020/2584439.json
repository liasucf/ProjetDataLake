    "text": "The National Assembly, formerly known as the Chamber of Deputies, is the unicameral legislative branch of the government of Djibouti. ==Overview== It consists of 65 members \u2013 30 Somali (21 Issa) and 30 Afar \u2013 elected to serve five-year terms in multi-seat (4 to 37 each) constituencies. The first free multi-party parliamentary election since independence (1977) was held in 2003, with the ruling coalition, led by the People's Rally for Progress (RPP), receiving 62.7% of the vote. Idriss Arnaoud Ali was President of the National Assembly from 2003 until his death in 2015. He was succeeded by Mohamed Ali Houmed. For its entire existence, the National Assembly has been dominated by the Popular Rally for Progress, which is presently the senior partner in the Union for a Presidential Majority coalition. From 1981 to 1992, the RPP was the sole legal party. Even after opposition parties were legalized in 1992, the RPP won every seat in the legislature. From 1997 onward, it fought elections as part of a coalition, known since 2003 as the UMP, which continued to sweep every seat. Opposition parties did not manage to enter the legislature until 2013. The Djiboutian political system concentrates most power in the president's hands, and there is little opposition to executive decisions. ==Presidents== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Name ! Took office !
