    "text": "Norway was represented by Kirsti Sparboe, with the song '\"Oj, oj, oj, s\u00e5 glad jeg skal bli\", at the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 29 March in Madrid. \"Oj, oj, oj, s\u00e5 glad jeg skal bli\" was chosen as the Norwegian entry at the Melodi Grand Prix on 1 March. This was the last of three Eurovision appearances in five years for Sparboe. The lyrics of \"Oj, oj, oj, so glad jeg skal bli\" - in which the singer appears to tolerate her partner's philandering ways by trying to convince herself that one day he will give them up and devote himself to her - caused a considerable degree of adverse comment from some sections of Norwegian society and became the subject of a good deal of debate. ==Final== The MGP was held at the studios of broadcaster NRK in Oslo, hosted by Janka Polyani. Ten songs took part in the final, with the winner chosen by ten regional juries who each had 5 points to divide between the songs. Other performers included the previous year's Norwegian singer Odd B\u00f8rre and Lill-Babs, who had sung for Sweden in 1961.ESC National Finals database 1969 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | MGP - 1 March 1969 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Janka Polanyi, who was acting as spokesperson for the Norwegian Jury took over as Commentator, before NRK decided to connect with the contest via Sveriges TV. Just before the voting began, NRK were able to regain the connection with Christophersen who continued the broadcast. ==See also== *Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1969 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969 Category:Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1969 in Norwegian music Category:1969 in Norwegian television ",
