    "text": "Samuel Holroyd \"Tim\" Burton (30 November 1919 - 6 December 2005) was a British school teacher, college lecturer and prolific author of English language textbooks and books about the west of England. He also produced fiction, assembled anthologies and wrote a biography of William Shakespeare. He was a lifelong socialist, supporter of the Labour Party, and an anti-nuclear campaigner who set up a branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was chairman of the Exmoor Society and campaigned for the preservation of its open spaces. ==Early life and family== Samuel Burton, known as Tim, was born on 30 November 1919 at Caverswall, Staffordshire, England. His father had various occupations and his mother was a village schoolteacher. He received a scholarship that enabled him to attend Longton High School and then Queen's College, University of Cambridge. He joined the British Army in 1939 but was discharged in 1941 due to injury. He met his future wife Phyl while he was in a military hospital. ==Career== Blundell's School, Tiverton Burton first taught at King Edward VI school in Stafford before becoming head of English at Blundell's School in Devon from 1945 to 1964. He subsequently worked at St Luke's College of Education in Exeter and as a lecturer for the British Council and the Workers' Educational Association.SH (Tim) Burton. John Burton, The Guardian, 14 December 2005. Retrieved 30 July 2019. When not teaching he produced a large number of English language textbooks, as well as anthologies, biography, fiction, edited editions of classic works and books on Devon and Cornwall. He compiled anthologies of science fiction that he used for teaching purposes and thought effective because so many pupils already read the genre. His first published book was The Criticism of Poetry (1950) which remained in print for nearly four decades. By working evenings, weekends and holidays, and only in longhand because he could not stand typewriters, Burton managed to produce nearly 50 books of various kinds, saying in 1984 that, \"at present I have 14 royalty-earning books in print [that] bring me in a gross income of about \u00a33,000 a year ... to live, I have to write three books a year, and that's a cracking pace.\" Exmoor landscape He was a Shakespeare scholar and edited an edition of Henry V that was published in Longman's Heritage of Literature series in 1975. The less serious Shakespeare Detective and Other Short Stories contained four mystery stories authored by Burton and set in modern Stratford upon Avon but drawing on the town's connections with William Shakespeare. It was published in Longman's Structural Readers series in 1986 where the text is designed to suit particular levels of English language proficiency. Shakespeare's Life and Stage (1989), the fruit of a lifetime's study, was a major work that included an extended discussion of the bard's education,\"Shakespeare's Education, or the Circular Argument\" by Christopher Dams in but the poor sales were a great disappointment to the author. He wrote extensively on Devon and Cornwall including three books on Exmoor. His 1952 book of that title was described by his son John as the standard work on the area. His 1953 book on The North Devon Coast. A guide to its scenery & architecture, history & antiquities, was followed by its partner on the south Devon coast in 1954. In Devon Villages (1972), Burton described the problems unseen by tourists, such as young people leaving to find work, clergymen spread between multiple parishes, and the difficulty of forming a cricket team.\"By train to the West\", Ion Trewin, The Times, 12 April 1973, p. 15. Also in 1972, he produced The West Country in Robert Hale's The Regions of Britain series.Jenner, Michael. (1996) Traveller's Companion to the West Country. Godfrey Cave Associates. p. 11. ==Other activities== Burton was a socialist, a supporter of the Labour Party, and an anti-nuclear campaigner who in the 1960s set up a branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Tiverton. He became chairman of the Exmoor Society and was quoted in the pages of The Times arguing for the preservation of the moor from ploughing and enclosure.\"Exmoor National Park\", S. H.
