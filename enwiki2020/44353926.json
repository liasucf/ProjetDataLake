    "text": "The Robespierre Monument () was one of the first monuments erected in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (later part of the Soviet Union), raised in Moscow on 3 November 1918 \u2013 just ahead of the first anniversary of the October Revolution, which had brought the Bolsheviks to power. It depicted Maximilien de Robespierre, a prominent figure of the French Revolution. Located in Alexander Garden, it had been designed by the sculptor Beatrice Yuryevna Sandomierz (). Created as part of the \"monumental propaganda\" plan, the monument was commissioned by Vladimir Lenin, who in an edict referred to Robespierre as a \"Bolshevik avant la lettre\". It was only one of several planned statues depicting French revolutionaries \u2013 others were to be made of Georges Danton, Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf and Jean-Paul Marat, although only the one of Danton was ever completed. Another, also featuring Robespierre, was raised in Petrograd. Created in the context of the ongoing Russian Civil War and with the country in a state of war communism, there were few materials available to make the statue. Lacking bronze or marble, the monument was instead constructed using concrete, with hollow pipes running through it. This design proved frail, lasting only a few days. On the morning of 7 November only a pile of rubble remained. Over the following days different newspapers supplied varying versions as to why it collapsed, with Znamya Trudovoi Kommuny and others saying it was the work of \"criminal\" (counter-revolutionary) hands, and Izvestia stating the statue's demise was caused by improper construction. ==See also== * History of Moscow * Reign of Terror * Soviet art ==References== Category:1918 sculptures Category:Concrete sculptures in Russia Category:Destroyed landmarks in Russia Category:Cultural depictions of Maximilien Robespierre Category:Monuments and memorials built in the Soviet Union Category:Monuments and memorials in Moscow Category:Sculptures in the Soviet Union Category:Statues in Russia Category:Sculptures of men ",
