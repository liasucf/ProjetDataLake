    "text": "{| |} The Cessna Model 404 Titan is an American twin-engined, propeller-driven light aircraft built by Cessna Aircraft. It was that company's largest twin piston-engined aircraft at the time of its development in the 1970s. Its US military designation is C-28, and Swedish Air Force designation Tp 87. ==History== The aft doors on the left side The Cessna 404 was a development of the Cessna 402 with an enlarged vertical tail and other changes. The prototype first flew on 26 February 1975. It is powered by two 375 hp/280 kW turbocharged Continental Motors GTSIO-520 piston engines. Two versions were offered originally; the Titan Ambassador passenger aircraft for ten passengers, and the Titan Courier utility aircraft for passengers or cargo. By early 1982 seven different variants were available, including a pure cargo version, the Titan Freighter. The Freighter was fitted with a strengthened floor, cargo doors, and its interior walls and ceiling were made from impact- resistant polycarbonate materials to minimize damage in the event of cargo breaking free in-flight. ==Variants== * Titan Ambassador \u2013 Basic 10-seat passenger aircraft. * Titan Ambassador II \u2013 Ambassador with factory fitted avionics. * Titan Ambassador III \u2013 Ambassador with factory fitted avionics. * Titan Courier \u2013 Convertible passenger/cargo version. * Titan Courier II \u2013 Courier with factory fitted avionics. * Titan Freighter \u2013 Cargo version. * Titan Freighter II \u2013 Freighter with factory fitted avionics. * C-28A Titan \u2013 Designation given to two aircraft purchased by the United States Navy. ==Operators== ===Military operators=== ; *Royal Bahamas Defence Force ; *Bolivian Air Force ; *Colombian Air Force - 2 used by SATENA. ; *Dominican Republic Air Force ; *Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force \u2013 1 acquired 1979. ; *Mexican Navy ; *Swedish Air Force ; *Tanzania People's Defence Force ; *United States Navy (as the C-28A) ; * Puerto Rico Police Department Two C404 ==Specifications (Ambassador I)== ==See also== a Cessna 404 Titan (left) with square windows besides a pressurized Cessna 421 (right) with round windows ==References== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official Cessna Website * Incomplete Cessna 404 Titan Production List 404 Category:1970s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1975 Category:Twin piston-engined tractor aircraft ",
