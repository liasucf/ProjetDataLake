    "text": "Pierre Froidebise (15 May 1914 \u2013 28 October 1962) was a Belgian organist, composer, and musicologist. ==Life== Froidebise was born in the rural Condroz village of Ohey, province of Namur, the son of a well-off retail pharmacist. After completing his secondary education, he began studying the organ, first at the Namur Conservatory with and then with Paul de Maleingreau at the Brussels Conservatory, where he also studied composition with Raymond Moulaert and fugue with L\u00e9on Jongen. He took the first prize for organ in 1939, and in 1941 won the Agniez Prize for composition (; ). He subsequently studied composition with Paul Gilson and Jean Absil, before moving to Paris to further his organ studies with Charles Tournemire . In 1942 he became organist at the church of Saint-Jacques in Li\u00e8ge, where later he performed and was choirmaster at the Grand S\u00e9minaire and taught harmony at the Conservatory, where he was appointed professor in 1947 . In the meantime, he won the Belgian second Prix de Rome in 1943 for his cantata La navigation d\u2019Ulysse . As a teacher, his notable students include and Henri Pousseur. Froidebise died in Li\u00e8ge on 28 October 1962 . ==Compositional style== Froidebise's earliest organ compositions show the influence of C\u00e9sar Franck, but his enthusiasm soon turned to Igor Stravinsky for his model. His Trois po\u00e8mes japonais for voice and orchestra, Op. 1, No. 1 (1942), while exhibiting traits of his teacher Absil, in its overall feeling recalls Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics, and the Russian master's presence is even clearer in the Cinq comptines for voice and eleven instruments, Op. 1, No. 2 (1947), which was performed at the 1950 ISCM Festival . His discovery of the music of Anton Webern led to a decisive turn to serialism beginning in 1948, with the cantata Amerc\u0153ur\u2014a rather severe work setting Li\u00e8ge place names in an economical twelve-tone technique . From this point onward, Froidebise was a confirmed dodecaphonist and maintained regular contact with Olivier Messiaen, Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, and Pierre Boulez in Paris . His finest work, St\u00e8le pour Sei Shonagon (1958), for soprano and four instrumental groups, added aleatory elements to a warmer use of twelve-tone technique than that found in Amerc\u0153ur, combined with a supple rhythmic treatment . ==Compositions== ===Dramatic=== *Radio operas: **La berg\u00e8re et le ramoneur (1954) **La lune am\u00e8re (1956) *Ballets: **Le bal chez le voisin, orchestra (1954) **L\u2019aube *Incidental music: **Antigone (Sophocles, 1936) **Oedipe roi (Sophocles, ?1946) **Ce vieil Oedipe (A.
