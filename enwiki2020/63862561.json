At some point the system closed the Holy Family, Sacred Heart, and St. Ann campuses. The system was renamed Northwest Catholic Regional School in 1977 after four parishes joined the school system. In 1993 Fr. Holland Elementary School became a part of the system. The Holland building closed in 2008.

Military families from Fort Adams requested a Catholic school; Cluny opened in September 1957 as a kindergarten and added grades until 1965, when the first eighth grade graduation was held. Since the period, the overall population of Newport declined and the concentration of the middle class declined; much of the housing became too expensive for families with young children, and there were relatively few houses being sold in Newport to new residents. In addition many families previously going to Cluny instead sent their children to the Portsmouth School Department. From circa 2014 to 2017 the enrollment decreased by one fourth; the school administration stated that this decline and the general competition among private schools in the Newport area caused the operation of the school to be no longer viable. It closed in 2017. Betsy Sherman Walker of Newport This Week described the closure as a \"curveball\" unexpected by the community. ==References== Providence, Roman Catholic Diocese of Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence Schools Category:Defunct Catholic schools in the United States ",
