Etching by the Sieur de Rogissart, 1706. The Cave of Dogs (in Italian Grotta del Cane, literally \"Cave of the Dog\") is a small cave on the eastern side of the Phlegraean Fields near Pozzuoli, Naples. Inside the cave is a fumarole that releases carbon dioxide of volcanic origin. It was a famous, if gruesome, tourist attraction for travellers on the Grand Tour. The carbon dioxide gas, being denser than air, tends to accumulate in the deeper parts of the cave. Local guides, for a fee, would suspend small animals (usually dogs) inside it until they became unconscious. Because humans inhaled air from a higher level they were not affected. The dogs might be revived by submerging them in the cold waters of the nearby Lake Agnano. Tourists who came to see this attraction included Goethe, John Evelyn, Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re, and Mark Twain. The lake became polluted and it was drained in 1870; the spectacle fell into disuse and the cave was closed. However the area is now being restored by volunteers.Taylor, Alfred Swaine, An Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid, The London Medical and Physical Journal, 1832, 278-285.Fleming & Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective, Pittsburgh, 255-256.Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41-45.Jeff Matthews, Naples: Life, Death & Miracles: Agnano & the Grotto of the Dog. , visited 26.3.2015. \"The area degraded terribly after WWII and became an eyesore from shoddy overbuilding and illegal waste dumping. I drove by the baths hundreds of times over the years and never knew about the lake, never knew that I was 100 yards from the Grotto of the Dog ...\".Grotta del Cane visited 26.3.2015. The principle of the Cave of Dogs sketched by Alfred Swaine Taylor, 1832 The cave was often described in nineteenth century science textbooks to illustrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide,The above image is from L'air et le monde a\u00e8rien, an 1865 textbook by Arthur Mangin, p.162 and its reputation has given rise to a popular scientific demonstration of the same name. Stepped candles are successively extinguished by tipping carbon dioxide into a transparent container. The cave was recently investigated by Italian speleologists, including Rosario Varriale, who interpreted it as a man-made cavity constructed in antiquity, possibly as a sudatorium. The carbon dioxide level was measured at 9.9%.Napoli Underground, Grotta del Cane Nuove Ricerche. visited 26.3.2015. According to the Australian speleologist Garry K. Smith, a concentration of 5-10% produces in humans \u201cViolent panting and fatigue to the point of exhaustion merely from respiration & severe headache. Prolonged exposure at 5% could result in irreversible effects to health. Prolonged exposure at > 6% could result in unconsciousness and death.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Video of Cave of Dogs scientific demonstratiion Category:Caves of Italy Category:Carbon dioxide Category:Campanian volcanic arc Category:Cruelty to animals Category:Science demonstrations Category:Speleology Category:Toxicology Category:Tourism in Italy Category:Tourist attractions in Campania Category:Volcanism of Italy Category:Geotourism ",
