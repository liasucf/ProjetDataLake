    "text": "Venetian arsenal. Gouvia is a village and resort situated around Gouvino Bay in Corfu, Greece. It is situated around 8km (5 miles) North of Corfu town. Gouvias position in a natural harbour made it an ideal location for a shipyard, this was exploited during the Venetian occupation, when they built their arsenal in the village. The remains of it today are notable in the area. The village has a Greek Orthodox church, names All Saints'. There are many bars, restaurants and taverns along the main street serving mostly tourists from Northern Europe. There are a number of large hotels and self-catering apartments in the village. ==Venetian shipyard== Located near the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, Corfu was a very strategic location for Venice and the Venetians built extensive fortifications to defend the island against incursions. The island was also at the centre of their naval operations in the Levant. As part of their defence plans the Venetians stationed two squadrons in Corfu, one of twenty five galleys, the other of twelve heavy sailing ships. Two Venetian Vice Admirals oversaw the naval operations in Corfu, one for each squadron. In the aftermath of the second great siege of Corfu by the Ottomans in 1716, the Venetians, as part of their reinforcement of the fortifications of Corfu, built the arsenal to service their ships and also stationed their galleys at Govino Bay. The arsenal was also used as storage for the Venetian ships. The shipyard at Gouvia was part of a network of Venetian arsenals and naval stations in Greece, including shipyards in the Aegean Sea, Epirus, the Peloponnese, the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete) and even Venice itself. Aside from Corfu, such locations in Greece included Methoni, Koroni, Chalkis, Preveza, Chania and Heraklion. The Gouvia arsenal is in a strategic location well-suited to ship repairs as it was near a forested area and high quality wood was plentiful and easily available for ship maintenance. The practice of the Venetian captains, who participated in the construction of the arsenal, to inscribe the buildings with their initials and coats of arms, had been documented in the late-18th-century writings of French consul to Corfu Saint- Sauveur. The arsenal at Gouvia was supposed to be used for ship repairs during the winter after each fleet had returned from their yearly campaign during peacetime. However, the Venetian Senate became alarmed at the prospect of an arsenal in proximity to Venice which could potentially compete with the central arsenal and in order to protect the operations of their local naval facilities, the Senate opted to limit the kind of repair activities undertaken at the Corfu shipyard. Consequently, the shipyard operations at Gouvia were restricted to basic maintenance such as cleaning and caulking; many captains, instead of repairing their damaged ships at the arsenal, chose to sink them. As time went on, the number of ships being serviced at the location declined, and any further use was officially discontinued with the Treaty of Campo Formio, which was signed on 18 October 1798, marking the end of the Venetian Republic and with it the end of the Venetian period of Corfu, which had lasted for over 400 years. The surviving arches of the structure have been described as \"beautifully boned\", \"strong\" and \"impressive\", \"almost surreal\", and \"a striking collection of skeletal arches\". ==External links== *Gouvia ==References== Category:Populated places in Corfu (regional unit) ",
