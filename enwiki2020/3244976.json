This is as true now, as has been in the past, except between 1988 and 2004. In 1988, the NDP swept the island in a wave of popular support that saw the party win the most seats in its history. This was wiped out in 1993 however, when many NDP voters switched to the Reform Party which won every seat except Victoria, which was picked up by the Liberals for the first time since 1968. This arrangement continued until the resurgence of the NDP in 2004, which led to it picking up Nanaimo\u2014Cowichan, while the Liberals benefited by the seat switching of Keith Martin in Esquimalt\u2014Juan de Fuca, whose personal popularity allowed him to be re-elected as a Liberal. Since winning their first seat in the region in seventeen years in 2004, the NDP won two more seats here in 2006 picking up Victoria from the Liberals and Vancouver Island North from the Tories. The Tories won Vancouver Island North back in 2008. In 2011, the NDP picked up Esquimalt\u2014Juan de Fuca from the Liberals while Green Party leader Elizabeth May defeated Tory cabinet member Gary Lunn in Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands to win her party's first elected parliamentary seat in history. The Liberals failed to cross the 15 percent mark in any Vancouver Island-based riding. The island swung hard to the NDP in 2015; May was the only non-NDP MP elected here. In 2019, the Greens were able to pick up Nanaimo-Ladysmith, as well as win over 25% of the vote in Victoria and Esquimalt-Saanich Sooke. The Island is now a 3 way race between the NDP, the Conservatives, and the Greens. ==2019 - 43nd General Election== |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Courtenay\u2014Alberni | |Jonah Baden Gowans 8,620 11.93% | |Byron Horner 23,936 33.12% || |Gord Johns 29,790 41.21% | |Sean Wood 9,762 13.51% | | | |Barbara Biley (M-L) 172 0.24% || |Gord Johns |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Cowichan\u2014Malahat\u2014Langford | |Blair Herbert 10,301 15.79% | |Alana DeLong 16,959 26.00% || |Alistair MacGregor 23,519 36.06% | |Lydia Hwitsum 13,181 20.21% | |Rhonda Chen 1,066 1.63% | |Robin Morton Stanbridge (CHP) 202 0.31% || |Alistair MacGregor |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Esquimalt\u2014Saanich\u2014Sooke | |Jamie Hammond 12,554 17.90% | |Randall Pewarchuk 13,409 19.12% || |Randall Garrison 23,887 34.06% | |David Merner 18,506 26.39% | |Jeremy Gustafson 1,089 1.55% | |Fidelia Godron (Ind.) 99 0.14% Louis Lesosky (Ind.) 100 0.14% Philip Ney (Ind.) 83 0.12% Josh Steffler (Libert.) 287 0.41% Tyson Strandlund (Comm.) 111 0.16% || |Randall Garrison |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Nanaimo\u2014Ladysmith | |Michelle Corfield 9,735 13.55% | |John Hirst 18,634 25.93% | |Bob Chamberlin 16,985 23.63% || |Paul Manly 24,844 34.57% | |Jennifer Clarke 1,049 1.46% | |James Chumsa (Comm.) 104 0.14% Brian Marlatt (PC) 207 0.29% Geoff Stoneman (Ind.) 235 0.33% Echo White (Ind.) 71 0.10% || |Paul Manly |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |North Island\u2014Powell River | |Peter Schwarzhoff 8,251 13.11% | |Shelley Downey 20,502 32.59% || |Rachel Blaney 23,834 37.88% | |Mark de Bruijn 8,891 14.13% | |Brian Rundle 1,102 1.75% | |Carla Neal (M-L) 48 0.08% Glen Staples (Ind.) 287 0.46% || |Rachel Blaney |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Saanich\u2014Gulf Islands | |Ryan Windsor 11,326 16.62% | |David Busch 13,784 20.23% | |Sabina Singh 8,657 12.70% || |Elizabeth May 33,454 49.09% | |Ron Broda 929 1.36% | | || |Elizabeth May |- | style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |Victoria | |Nikki Macdonald 15,952 22.30% | |Richard Caron 9,038 12.63% || |Laurel Collins 23,765 33.21% | |Racelle Kooy 21,383 29.89% | |Alyson Culbert 920 1.29% | |Robert Duncan (Comm.) 113 0.16% Jordan Reichert (Animal) 221 0.31% Keith Rosenberg (VCP) 46 0.06% David Shebib (Ind.) 111 0.16% || |Murray Rankin\u2020 |} ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== {| |- |Key map | #Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca #Nanaimo-Alberni #Nanaimo-Cowichan #Saanich-Gulf Islands #Vancouver Island North #Victoria |- |Conservative Party of Canada |Green Party of Canada |- |Liberal Party of Canada |New Democratic Party |} ==Notes== ==References== Vancouver Island Category:Political history of British Columbia Category:Vancouver Island ",
