The song is sung by lead vocalist Linn Engstr\u00f6m, who also wrote the lyrics. ==Critical reception== Music & Media wrote about the song: \"The trio has already proved itself quite capable of climbing the charts; this one should have no trouble either. The US radio version is a little too bland, but EHR will love the mid-tempo reggae pop mix and its happy melodies.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 39 |- |} ==References== Category:1995 singles Category:1995 songs Category:Sonic Dream Collective songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:English-language Swedish songs ",
