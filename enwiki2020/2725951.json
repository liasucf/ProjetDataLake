    "text": "This article encompasses the 1840\u20131849 Atlantic hurricane seasons. While data is not available for every storm that occurred, some parts of the coastline were populated enough to give data of hurricane occurrences. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation occurs between June 1 and November 30. ==1840== ===Tropical Storm One=== June 19\u201323.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #331 In the middle of June, a tropical storm passed west of Lake Charles, Louisiana accompanied by several days of heavy rain.

September 25-October 4.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #336 The hurricane was first reported near Barbados and later became an intense hurricane that remained offshore of the Carolinas in early October. It moved northeastward, entraining cold air into its circulation. It became an extratropical storm, and hit New England on October 3. It led to a storm of snow and sleet in Connecticut, bringing drifts of up to of snow in some areas. The storm wrecked the Georges Bank fishing fleet which drowned 81 fishermen and knocked down trees, tore roofs off houses and forced boats to go up on shore. The storm also destroyed a saltworks factory along Cape Cod, sending the economy to a slump. In 1842, a monument was erected to remember the sailors and fishermen lost at sea to the \"October Gale\" of 1841. ===Hurricane Five=== The Key West Hurricane of 1841. October 18\u201321.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #337 In October, a hurricane hit Cuba, crossing near Havana. After crossing the island, it passed by the Florida Keys on October 18 and 19. The hurricane eroded part of Key West, destroyed the keeper's house at Sand Key Light, and damaged the seawall and later headed towards Bermuda. Wrecked many ships in Lower Keys. http://www.keyshistory.org/hurricanelist.html ==1842== The 1842 Atlantic hurricane season featured several maritime catastrophes in the Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. East Coast, and produced one of the only known tropical cyclones to directly affect the Iberian Peninsula. As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database, records of most storms in 1842 are scarce, and only approximate tracks are known. ===Hurricane One=== The First North Carolina Hurricane of 1842.

The cyclone moved across the Florida Keys on September 4. Damaged Sand Key lighthouse. It continued westward across the Gulf of Mexico, landing between Matamoros and Tampico, Mexico. Its unusual westward movement, also seen by a hurricane in 1932 and Hurricane Anita in 1977, was due to a strong high pressure system to its north. ===Hurricane Five=== The Galveston Hurricane of 1842. September 9\u201330.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #341 A strong tropical storm started near Tobago and traveled into the Gulf of Mexico and hit Galveston, Texas on September 17.

The Florida Panhandle experienced the effects of a tropical storm, marked by gale-force winds at Pensacola on September 22 and 23. No appreciable damage was reported. Ludlum considered that this may have been a continuation of the Galveston storm, but judged it to be a separate system. ===Hurricane Seven=== The Gulf to Bermuda Hurricane of 1842. September 30-October 9.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #342 A hurricane passed by Galveston on October 5, causing flooding and the sinking of one ship.

It moved northeastward, bringing rain and strong winds to the United States coastline but remaining offshore. The schooner revenue cutter Vigilant, USRC Vigilant, was lost off Key West during this hurricane on the 4th and 5th. Many of the structures built by the Navy on Indian Key and all wharves were washed away.Maritime Business Strategies, LLC. William H. Webb.

September 5\u201311.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #353 A slow-moving hurricane remained offshore of Cape Hatteras on September 6. It pushed water into the Pamlico Sound. When the hurricane moved far enough north, the northerly winds pushed the water back out, creating two major inlets on the Outer Banks, the Hatteras Inlet and the Oregon Inlet. The latter bearing the name of the first large ship that passed through it. ===Hurricane Two=== September 10\u201324.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #354 Hurricane originated near the Leeward Islands.

October 5\u201315.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #356 In October, a major hurricane, likely of Category 5 intensity, moved through the Caribbean Sea. This Great Havana Hurricane struck western Cuba on October 10. Atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916 mbar. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category 5-strength winds. In Cuba, the storm caused hundreds of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. It hit the Florida Keys on October 11, destroying the old Key West Lighthouse, the Sand Key Light, and Fort Zachary Taylor. In Key West, widespread destruction was noted, with 40 deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with all but eight of the 600 houses in Key West damaged or destroyed. Water rose to about 8 feet in lower streets. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. The hurricane was so destructive that years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s. The hurricane then headed northward, and on October 13 and hit Tampa Bay as a major hurricane. As it approached, it sucked the water out of the bay, causing the Manatee River to be so low that people walked horses across it. The hurricane moved across Florida, and remained inland over Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina. It moved up the Chesapeake Bay, causing extensive damage through Virginia, Maryland, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania. Some disputed reports say that at least 600 were killed; however, the official death report from Cuba says 163 deaths and damage throughout the areas it affected. ==1847== ===Hurricane One=== October 10\u201313.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #357 A hurricane hit Tobago on October 11, resulting in 27 casualties. ===Tropical Storm Two=== A severe tropical cyclone visited Galveston, Texas.http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1915.pdf This may represent a continuation of the previous storm. ==1848== Track of Hurricane II of 1848 ===Tropical Storm One=== On August 18, a tropical storm hit south central Louisiana, causing damage to cotton crops. ===Hurricane Two=== August 18-September 2.Reassessment of Historical Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclone Activity 1700-1855 (2006), M Chenoweth, Final Storm #358 A hurricane tracked northeast of the Caribbean Sea through the Bahamas and recurved through the North Atlantic shipping lanes towards Europe between August 19 and September 2.Michael Chenoweth.

It reshaped parts of the coast and destroyed much of what few human works and habitation were then in the Tampa Bay Area. Although available records of its wind speed are unavailable, its barometric pressure and storm surge were consistent with at least a Category 4 hurricane. It was the most severe hurricane to affect Tampa Bay in the U.S. state of Florida and is one of only two major hurricanes to make landfall in the area, the other having occurred in 1921. Tides rose and the barometric pressure dipped to . It crossed to the east coast where it damaged houses, caused flooding and interfered with shipping.Brian H. Bossak.
