    "text": "Gar\u00e7on \u00e0 la Pipe (Boy with a Pipe) is a painting by Pablo Picasso. It was painted in 1905 when Picasso was 24 years old, during his Rose Period, soon after he settled in the Montmartre section of Paris, France. The oil on canvas painting depicts a Parisian boy holding a pipe in his left hand and wearing a garland or wreath of flowers. The painting was famously sold at a 2004 auction for $104 million, a price many art critics consider incongruous with the painting's actual artistic merit. \"[...] it's unlikely there's a single art historian who would rate this Rose Period picture [...] as among the 100 most important Western art works ever made. You'd have a hard time finding someone who would put it in the top 1,000. Top 10,000, anyone?\" == The painting == === Preparation === Early preparations of this work involved positioning the boy in all types of poses that involved standing, sitting or leaning against the wall. After much repositioning of the model, Picasso decided to go with the boy sitting down. Next was how to position the arm, where much time was also spent on the height and angle. Early works do not show any objects other than a pipe being used. Although Picasso started to paint this picture, he gave it a rest period for about a month. During this time, Picasso decided to finish it off by placing a garland of flowers on the boy's head. === The boy === Picasso lived at the Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre when he painted the picture. Some of the local people made a living in the entertainment industry, such as being clowns or acrobats. Picasso used many local people in his pictures, but little is known about the boy in the picture. What appears to be fact from comments made from a variety of sources is that the boy was a model in his teen years who hung around Picasso's studio and volunteered to pose for the oil work. Picasso's own comments about the boy were that he was one of the: From this comment, suppositions can be made. The first is that Picasso did not want people to know who the boy is, and the second is Picasso did not really know the boy. However, many reports have been made that say the boy is \u201cp\u2019tit Louis\u201d, or \"Little Louis\". ==Provenance== The painting was first bought by John Hay Whitney in 1950 for US$30,000. On May 5, 2004 the painting was sold for US$104,168,000 at Sotheby's auction in New York City. Sotheby\u2019s did not name the buyer though sources say that it was Guido Barilla, co-owner of the Barilla Group.Claire Foy-Smith, Who buys paintings for $104m?, BBC News Online, 6 May 2004 At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting (when inflation is ignored). The amount, US$104 million, includes the auction price of US$93 million plus the auction house\u2019s commission of about US$11 million. The painting was given a pre-sale estimate of US$70 million by the auction house. Many art critics have stated that the painting's high sale price has much more to do with the artist's name than with the merit or historical importance of the painting.
