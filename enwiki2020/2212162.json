    "text": "Earth Moving is the 12th record album by British musician Mike Oldfield, released in 1989. Unlike Oldfield's albums released prior to Earth Moving, the album contains no instrumental tracks. == Album analysis == Oldfield used several vocalists on the album, including his then girlfriend, Anita Hegerland. The album's music was performed mainly with synthesizers. It was the first time Oldfield recorded an album without an instrumental piece; each track being vocal-based pop and rock songs. Oldfield's only other album free of instrumentals to date is 2014's Man on the Rocks. The final track, despite appearing to be a lengthier piece, consists of two short, apparently unconnected songs, combined into one track, with a noticeable pause in between. According to Oldfield, the album was made in full compliance with his recording company, Virgin Records, which demanded he create more commercially oriented material than his previous albums. After recording Earth Moving Oldfield wanted to move away from 'computerised music' and return to real musicians and instruments; this is evident in his next album, Amarok. == Promotion == According to an interview Mike Oldfield and Anita Hegerland gave on the television programme Good Morning Britain, the song \"Innocent\" was inspired by their young daughter Greta, who appears in the song's music video. In the programme, Oldfield and Hegerland performed an acoustic version of the song, Hegerland singing and Oldfield playing the guitar. \"Earth Moving\", \"Innocent\" and \"(One Glance Is) Holy\" were released as singles. == Equipment == Earth Moving is the first album on which Oldfield used PRS guitars, having previously used Gibson guitars. Synthesizers on the album include a Fairlight Series III and various instruments made by Roland and Korg (including an M1). The album was recorded using an Atari 1040ST with C-Lab Notator software, a Harrison Series X console, a Studer A8800 tape deck with Dolby SR noise reduction, an Ampex Grand Master tape and ATC SCM200 monitors. == Track listing == All tracks written by Mike Oldfield. === Side one === # \"Holy\" \u2013 4:37 # \"Hostage\" \u2013 4:09 # \"Far Country\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Innocent\" \u2013 3:30 # \"Runaway Son\" \u2013 4:05 === Side two === # \"See the Light\" \u2013 3:59 # \"Earth Moving\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Blue Night\" \u2013 3:47 # \"Nothing But\" / \"Bridge to Paradise\" \u2013 8:40 == Personnel == * Mike Oldfield \u2013 guitars and keyboards * Max Bacon \u2013 vocals (\"Hostage\", \"Bridge to Paradise\") * Adrian Belew \u2013 vocals (\"Holy\"), left channel guitar solo (\"Far Country\") * Nikki \"B\" Bentley \u2013 vocals (\"Earth Moving\") * Anita Hegerland \u2013 vocals (\"Innocent\") * Carol Kenyon \u2013 vocals (\"Nothing But\") * Raphael Ravenscroft \u2013 saxophone * Maggie Reilly \u2013 vocals (\"Blue Night\") * Phil Spalding \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (\"Bridge to Paradise\", \"See the Light\", \"Holy\") * Chris Thompson \u2013 vocals (\"Runaway Son\", \"See the Light\") * Carl Wayne \u2013 backing vocals (\"Earth Moving\") * Mark Williamson \u2013 vocals (\"Far Country\") ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Mike Oldfield Discography - Earth Moving at Tubular.net * Earth Moving lyrics at Tubular.net Category:Mike Oldfield albums Category:1989 albums Category:Virgin Records albums ",
