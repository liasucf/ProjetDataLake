    "text": "Joshua William Wright (born 6 November 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays for Leyton Orient. A midfielder. Wright played for Gillingham between 2015\u201317, Millwall from 2011\u201315 and Scunthorpe United between 2009\u201311. He began his career at Charlton Athletic at the age of 17 in 2007, but spent the majority of his two years there on loan at Barnet, Brentford and Gillingham. ==Club career== ===Charlton Athletic=== Born in Bethnal Green, London, Wright started his football career at Charlton Athletic, with whom he signed a two-year professional contract in April 2007 at the age of 17 alongside close friend Harry Arter. Before joining Charlton's academy full-time at the age of 16, he attended Chigwell School in Chigwell, and Roding Valley High School in Loughton, Essex. Fellow professionals Lee Sawyer and Billy Lumley also attended Roding Valley High School, while Jordan Spence was in the same year group as Wright at Chigwell. He plays in midfield as a playmaker. In August of that year, Wright moved to Barnet on loan for what eventually amounted to three months. After a successful spell, which saw him score his first ever goal against Stockport County and be named Barnet's player of the month for November, he returned to Charlton. A month later, he was re-signed on loan by Barnet for the remainder of the 2007\u201308 season. On 19 September 2008, Wright was signed by League Two side Brentford on a month's loan. The loan was extended but soon after Alan Pardew decided to call Wright back due to an injury crisis at the club, where he made an impressive display for Brentford under the management of Andy Scott. Following his return from a loan spell at Brentford, he made his debut for Charlton in a 1\u20131 draw against Burnley on 25 October 2008, where he was started for the match. He then joined Gillingham on loan in March 2009 until the end of the season. He made his debut for Gillingham on 4 April 2009 in the 2\u20130 home defeat to Barnet. His four appearances at Gillingham impressed Mark Stimson that he extended Wright's loan spell with Gillingham, which allowed him to play in the play- offs. Wright was responsible for the corner kick that allowed striker Simeon Jackson to score in the 2009 Football League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, sending Gillingham to Football League One for the 2009\u201310 campaign. Despite making his best efforts for Gillingham, Charlton weren't convinced of Wright and instead released him upon his contract expiring. ===Scunthorpe United=== He signed for Scunthorpe United in July 2009 on a two-year contract. Upon joining Scunthorpe United, Wright revealed he turned down a move to big clubs in order to join Scunthorpe United and was motivated to join the Iron for first team football. Wright made his debut for the club, where he came on as a substitute for Gary Hooper in the 49th minute, in a 4\u20130 loss against Cardiff City in the opening game of the season. Since his debut, Wright quickly made an impact for the club and established himself in the starting eleven \"as the holding player in United's four-man midfield.\" In his first season, Wright made thirty-five appearance for the club. In his second season at Scunthorpe United, Wright started his season when he scored his first goal for the club in a Football League Cup game against Manchester United on 22 September 2010. After the match, Wright said he is more than pleased to score his first goal which he cited as a \"long time coming\". Wright started well for the club until his playing time minutes significantly decreased later in the season. In the January transfer window, Wright requested a transfer, during which he was offered a new contract and prepared for his exit from Scunthorpe United. This came after Reading were keen to sign him and he was keen to move down to the south. However, his father stated that Wright would be unlikely to move to the club in the January transfer window, but would leave in the summer. After the failed transfer move in the January transfer window, Wright expected to be back in the first team and earn playing time, as well as withdrawing his transfer request. Unfortunately, his loss of form and a foot injury that kept him out for the rest of 2010\u201311 season cost him his first team place. Despite the loss of form costing him his first team place, Wright, nevertheless, made thirty-six appearance for the club. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Wright was one of seven players released by Scunthorpe in May 2011. At the time, Wright was once linked again to a number of Championship clubs, having held discussions. ===Millwall=== After leaving Scunthorpe, Wright suffered a foot injury ahead of the 2011\u201312 season, which prevented him from joining a new club. In November 2011, he joined Championship side Millwall on a free transfer following a successful trial period. The club signed Wright on a \"short-term deal running until the January 2012 transfer window\". On 3 January 2012, Wright made his debut for Millwall against Bristol City and made his first start before coming off for Jimmy Abdou in the 67th minute of a 1\u20130 loss. Millwall subsequently extended his contract until the end of the season. On 25 February 2012, Wright scored his first goal with a 30-yard volley in a 3\u20131 win over Burnley.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17082934 His 30-yard volley against Burnley earned him awards. His performance at Millwall led the club to offer him a new contract on a long-term deal. At the end of the season, Wright went on to sign a new three-year deal, keeping him until 2015. During the 2012\u201313 season, Wright switched his shirt number from forty-four to number four. However, his second season did not go so well for him, as he was overlooked and mostly featured on the substitute bench. On 19 November 2013, Wright signed on loan for Leyton Orient. After making two appearances, Wright was recalled by Millwall due to an injury crisis at the club. ===Leyton Orient=== During a second loan spell with Leyton Orient, Wright's contract with Millwall was cancelled on 5 January 2015 to enable him to negotiate a permanent move to another club. He re-signed for Leyton Orient the following day. ===Gillingham=== Wright rejoined Gillingham in August 2015 on a short- term contract. The following month he signed a new deal to extend his time with the club until the end of the season. On 29 June 2016 he signed a new two-year deal with the club. At the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, Wright was named captain by then-manager Justin Edinburgh. However, after Edinburgh was sacked and Adrian Pennock became manager, defender Max Ehmer was named captain. On 11 March 2017 in a League One fixture Wright scored a 9-minute hat trick of penalties against his former side Scunthorpe United. In doing so he became the first player to score a hat trick of penalties in an English (top four tiers) league game since Alan Slough for Peterborough United in a 4\u20133 loss at Chester on 29 April 1978. On 22 April 2017 he was named the club's player of the season, players' player of the season and the away supporters' player of the season. ===Southend United=== In August 2017, Wright's contract with Gillingham was terminated and he subsequently signed for Southend United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2-0 EFL Trophy win against Colchester United on 7 November 2017. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season he was released by the club. ===Bradford City=== In May 2018 it was announced that Wright would sign for Bradford City on 1 July 2018. He was appointed club captain on 1 August 2018. He was later stripped of the captaincy, and dropped from the first-team, not making a start for five months until 13 March 2019, after which his attitude was praised by new manager Gary Bowyer. ===Leyton Orient=== In June 2019 Wright re-joined Leyton Orient. He was the final player to be signed by manager Justin Edinburgh, who died on 8 June. ==International career== Wright made his debut for his country at U16 level against Japan in March 2005. Since then, he has represented England at the U17, U18 and, most recently, U19 levels. He was captain of the U17 side on several occasions, having previously captained the U16 team. ==Awards== *2011\u201312 Goal of the Season, Millwall *2013\u201314 Community Ambassador of the Year, Millwall *2015\u201316 Runner-up, Player of the Season, Gillingham *2016\u201317 Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season, Away Supporters' Player of the Season, Gillingham ==Personal life== Wright is the brother of The Only Way Is Essex stars Mark and Jess Wright.
