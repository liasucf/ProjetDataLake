    "text": "Piran Gushnasp, also known by his baptized name of Grigor, was an Iranian commander from the House of Mihran. In the early 6th century, he was appointed as the new governor (marzban) of Iberia. Between 540-542 he converted to Christianity, assuming the Christian name of Grigor. However, this made his family boycott all contact with him, and he was soon executed in 542 at Peroz- Shapur due to apostasy. A companion of Piran, Yazd-panah, was also executed. == Sources == * * * * * Category:House of Mihran Category:Converts to Christianity from Zoroastrianism Category:542 deaths Category:Sasanian governors of Iberia Category:People executed by the Sasanian Empire Category:Christians in the Sasanian Empire Category:6th-century Christian martyrs Category:6th-century Iranian people ",
