These included: Energy and Technology; Agriculture; Education; Senior Health, Security and Retirement and Appropriations. During his time in the Michigan House, Proos was able to boast several accomplishments. As a member of the minority party, Proos introduced legislation that became law and was eventually known as Michigan's \"cottage food\" law. The law allows homemade goods to be sold at small operations such as farmer's markets as long as a visible label exists to inform consumers that the food was prepared in a cottage kitchen that had not been inspected by the Michigan Department of Agriculture. Since its passage, the cottage food law has been credited for bolstering many home-based businesses and has come to personify Proos' political philosophy of \"More Jobs, Less Government\" Proos' time in the Michigan House was also defined by his chairmanship of the Michigan House Republican Task Force on Jobs.http://www.harborcountry- news.com/articles/2010/11/11/news/doc4cd1b8b50fc6c831859830.txt ==External links== *GOP House Page *Official Site *Campaign Site ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Members of the Michigan House of Representatives Category:Living people Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Michigan state senators Category:21st-century American politicians ",
