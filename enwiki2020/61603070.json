    "text": "L'Art Moderne was a weekly review of the arts and literature published in Brussels from March 1881 until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. It was established by a number of lawyers based in Brussels who felt the need for a regular overview of the cultural life of the capital. The leading figures in the founding group were Edmond Picard and Octave Maus.Jane Block, \"Les XX and La Libre Esth\u00e9tique\", in Impressionism to Symbolism: The Belgian Avant-Garde, 1880-1900, edited by MaryAnne Stevens with Robert Hoozee (Royal Academy of Arts, London, in association with Ludion Press, Ghent, 1994), p. 41. The poet and art critic \u00c9mile Verhaeren (also a lawyer) soon became a frequent contributor. Each issue was eight pages long, and reviews were unsigned. Initially the review's editorial line opposed \"Art for art's sake\" (promoted by the rival La Jeune Belgique) under the alternative slogan l'art social (\"social art\"), insisting that art should serve progressive social and political purposes. This stance was later softened. Despite the differences in editorial emphasis, several contributors wrote for both reviews. L'Art Moderne was closely involved in promoting two fin de si\u00e8cle Belgian art movements, Les XX and La Libre Esth\u00e9tique. ==References== ==External links== * Digitised issues (Digith\u00e8que de l'Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles) Category:1881 establishments in Belgium Category:1914 disestablishments in Belgium Category:Magazines published in Belgium Category:Visual arts magazines Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Europe Category:Defunct magazines published in Belgium Category:French-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1881 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1914 Category:Magazines published in Brussels Category:Weekly magazines published in Belgium ",
