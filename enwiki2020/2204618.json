He then worked in Paris as a sound engineer at studio +XXX (\"plus thirty\") where he met Philippe Zdar of Cassius, with whom he worked as Motorbass for the album Pansoul, a preview of what would be his first solo album, Super Discount, released in 1996, with Air, Alex Gopher and other French artists on Solid. \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy has been involved in various music projects where he worked as a producer. ==Releases== Super Discount was \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy's first release, including the well known singles \"Tout doit dispara\u00eetre\" (Everything must go) and \"Prix Choc\" (Shock Price). Super Discount is considered by many as the first album of what is called the French touch. Super Discount received very favourable reviews and sold over 200,000 copies. Four years after Super Discount, \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy released Tempovision. Unlike Super Discount, which was perfectly adapted for the radio, Tempovision is a mature album, a deep reflection on the electronic music of this time. In \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy's opinion it was a blues album, differing from some of his earlier and more recent work. The Tempovision track \"Am I Wrong\" used a sample of Millie Jackson's voice singing \"Am I wrong to hunger...\", from the song \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\". \"Am I Wrong\" peaked at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in January 2001. The three 3D animated videos to accompany singles from the Tempovision album were directed by \u00c9tienne's brother, Geoffroy de Cr\u00e9cy. Eight years after the first Super Discount album, came Super Discount 2 with the original team, and the addition of Cassius. For this album, he used only old analog instruments, for example a TB303, and produced twelve electro-house-pop-new wave songs designed for clubs, in the continuity of the first Super Discount. Pursuing the 'discount' concept of the first album, all the tracks are named after peer-to- peer clients: \"Overnet\", \"Napster\", and so on. \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy, talking about the concept for the third album, said: \u201cyou have to be autistic in working in the music industry not to realize that something happens through the MP3 exchanges. It\u2019s not discount anymore! It\u2019s free!\u201d and added \u201cwhat the music industry doesn\u2019t understand, is that young people will not build their own music culture if they don\u2019t have free access to the music.\u201d \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy's more recent tracks have focused more on an electronic sound. They have also begun to be released on the Pixadelic label. ==Selected discography== The discography of \u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy consists of four studio albums, one live album, three compilation albums, eighteen extended plays and fifteen singles. === Studio albums === * Super Discount (1996, Different) * Tempovision (2000, Solid) FR No. 57 * Super Discount 2 (2004, Solid) FR No. 72, BE (FL) No. 70 * Super Discount 3 (2015, Pixadelic/A+LSO/Sony Music) FR No. 40, BE (FL) No. 56, BE (WA) No. 103, SWI No. 99 * B.E.D (2018, PIAS, collaboration with Baxter Dury and Delilah Holliday) ===Live albums=== * Live on Neptune (2007, Pixadelic) (digital only) ===Compilation albums=== * Tempovision Remixes (2002, Solid) * Beats'n'Cubes Vol.1 (2011, Dim Mak) * My Contribution to the Global Warming (2012, Pixadelic) ===Extended plays and singles=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=2| Year !rowspan=2| Title !colspan=4| Chart positions !rowspan=2| Album |-style=\"font-size:smaller;\" !width=30| FR !width=30| BE !width=30| NL !width=30| UK |- |rowspan=4| 1996 | Super Discount -
