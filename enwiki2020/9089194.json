    "text": "Sickla kanalbro Sickla kanalbro (Swedish: \"Sickla Canal Bridge\") is a bridge in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching over Sickla kanal (\"Canal of Sickla\"), it connects S\u00f6dra Hammarbyhamnen to Nacka. The name Sickla is believed to be derived from a 15th-century provincial word, sik, meaning \"minor marsh\". A product of post-WW2 traffic loads, the bridge was built 1954-1955 as a continuous steel girder bridge resting on four supports and carrying a concrete roadway. 60 metres long and 10,3 metres wide, the bridge passes over three spans with a maximum span of 23 metres and an average horizontal clearance over the canal of 4,6 metres. The supports are built on a foundation of concrete poles, while the abutments are resting directly on the bedrock. The bridge was originally built with a future widening in mind, something which had to wait until 1979 when a 2,6 metres wide cantilevering pathway was added on the south side of the roadway. == References == == See also == * List of bridges in Stockholm * Danviksbron * Sicklauddsbron * Sickla sluss Category:Bridges in Stockholm Category:Bridges completed in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in Sweden ",
