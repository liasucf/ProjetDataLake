In 2004, Jaud was the narrator of the Emmy Award-winning series \"Adoption Stories\" (Discovery Health) and traveled to New York for the event. But it was her voiceover work on the animated series Ed, Edd n Eddy that had the greatest impact. Jaud met children from the Make-A-Wish Foundation who faced life- threatening diseases. After this experience, she created \u2018The Magic of Think\u2019 and began writing books, music, nursery rhymes, and videos to help children develop strength and courage. In 2008, Jaud released her first album in the Christmas music genre. She wrote songs with tongue-in-cheek humour. Many of these jazz songs have been chosen to be in movies such as Blond and Blonder, American Mary, Debbie Macomber\u2019s Dashing Through the Snow, and Making Mr. Right.
