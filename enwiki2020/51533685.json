In January 2016, the company announced that the studio will be co-headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk. In 2016, the company partnered with Netflix to exclusively air its first television program, an animated series based on Activision's video game series Skylanders, called Skylanders Academy. Also in 2016, Activision Blizzard Studios entered into a content licensing agreement with a third-party production studio, Legendary Pictures, to produce sequels to the Warcraft feature film, based on their video game franchise World of Warcraft. By April 2017, work on a film based on Activision's video game series Call of Duty had generated several scripts, with the hope that filming would begin in 2018. The company also hopes to create films based on Overwatch and others. == Productions == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Year ! Title ! class=\"unsortable\"| Co-production with !
