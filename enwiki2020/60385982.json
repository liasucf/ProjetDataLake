Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=762190 on 2019-04-01 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 13 mm, its diameter 5\u00bd mm. The small, whitish golden yellow shell has an ovate-fusiform shape. It contains 6\u2153 whorls. The convex whorls are slightly excavated near the suture. The first 1\u00bd whorls are smooth. The upper ones only are longitudinally ribbed (about 10). And the minute striation forms a very fine reticulation over the entire surface. These are the chief characteristics of this very distinct species. The body whorl is tumid and contracted at the base. The aperture is slightly longer than the spire. The columella stands almost straight. The siphonal canal is short and slightly recurved. The outer lip is markedly sinuated at the suture and incrassate outwards.Smith E.A. (1882). Diagnoses of new species of Pleurotomidae in the British Museum. Annals and Magazine of Natural History. ser. 5, 10: 296-306 ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off Japan. ==References== * Stahlschmidt P., Poppe G.T. & Chino M.
