    "text": "A nunt is a pastry originating from Jewish cuisine and vaguely resembles nougat. The pastry is predominantly served at the Jewish celebration of Purim, where self-made sweets are customarily given to neighbours and friends. Nunt is traditionally made from dark forest honey, which is cooked along with sugar and then mixed with coarsely cut walnuts. The result is placed on a smooth, wet board or an oiled marble plate, left to cool, and then cut into small rhombic-shaped pieces. Variants of nunt exist where poppy seed is added along with the walnuts, or the honey is enriched with ginger or sesame. ==References== Category:Jewish cuisine Category:Pastries with poppy seeds Category:Purim foods ",
