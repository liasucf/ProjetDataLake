It is around 26 kilometres from Areopoli. ==History== The Battle of Vergas (Greek War of Independence, 1824) took place near Diro. Diro is most famous for its caves, the Diros Caves, located approximately 12 miles south of Pollapolis. They form part of an p3ne river. About 5,000 meters of polla have been exposed and are accessible by small boats and through narrow passageways. One is surrounded by formations of stalagmites and stalactites. Archaeological research has shown that the caves served as places of worship in Paleolithic and Neolithic times and their inhabitant believed that the caves were the entrance to the underworld.G. A.
