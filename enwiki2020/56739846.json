She exhibited an oil, A Dreamer, at the World's Congress of Representative Women of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893; and was also an exhibitor at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904. ==Early years and education== Frances Miller was born in Newark, New York, July 11, 1860. She was a descendant of an old Lutheran family from Saxony. Her childhood was passed in the Genesee Valley. When a mere child, her artistic faculty attracted the attention of her teachers. She was educated in the public schools, but without instruction in her special line, in which she continued to show development. ==Career== In 1879, she married John E. Mumaugh, of Omaha, Nebraska, where they afterward resided. She was soon identified with western art and artists. Broad in her ideas, she was not a follower of any particular school, and sought for herself nature's inspirations. Thrown on her own resources in 1885, with a two-year- old daughter to care for, worked diligently to be a recognized western artists. With the exception of a course of study in water-color under Jules Gu\u00e9rin, of Chicago, a summer course in oil with Dwight Frederick Boyden, of Paris, as well as a course with William Merritt Chase, her progress was due almost entirely to her own efforts. She delighted in landscapes, in which line she was always successful. She also designed holiday cards and gift tags for large firms, finding a big demand for them. Mumaugh kept a studio in Omaha's Paxton block. As a teacher, her classes were always full. She conducted the art department in Long Pine Chautauqua for four years, and one season in Fremont, Nebraska. She served on the board of directors of the Western Art Association since its organization, in 1888. Mumaugh died in 1933. ==Gallery== ;Mumaugh's Christmas card designs (1920) Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 1.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 2.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 3.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 4.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 5.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 6.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 7.png Design for Christmas cards by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 8.png ;Mumaugh's Christmas gift tag designs (1920) Design for gift tag for Christmas presents by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 1.png Design for gift tag for Christmas presents by Frances Mumaugh (1920) 2.png ==Notes== ==References== ===Attribution=== * * * ===Bibliography=== * * * Category:1860 births Category:1933 deaths Category:People from Newark, New York Category:American still life painters Category:American graphic designers Category:19th-century American painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:American women painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:19th-century American women artists Category:Women graphic designers Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ",
