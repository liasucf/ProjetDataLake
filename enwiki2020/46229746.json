    "text": "\"How Little We Know\" is a song written by written by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer for the 1944 film To Have and Have Not, where it is performed by the character \"Slim\" played by Lauren Bacall. A young Andy Williams recorded the song for the film as a possible alternative track to dub Bacall's low voice. Bacall said they used her singing. After the film's release it was a hit recording sung by Judy Johnson. It has been covered periodically, most recently in 1999 by Michael Feinstein with the Maynard Ferguson Big Band for the album Big City Rhythms. This song should not be confused with the Carolyn Leigh/Phillip Springer composition \"(How Little It Matters) How Little We Know\", which was first recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1956. ==References== Category:1944 songs Category:Songs written for films Category:Songs with music by Hoagy Carmichael Category:Songs with lyrics by Johnny Mercer ",
