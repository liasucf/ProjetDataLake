His most recent project, an EP entitled Possessed, was released in September 2018. ==Early life== Noah Gale was born in Queens, New York and grew up in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. He wrote his first rap in sixth grade and began releasing music at age 15 in 2008 using the stage name Nero. He released an early mixtape at that time. In 2010, he was featured on the track \"30,000\" on the Casey Veggies album Sleeping in Class. ==Career== In 2011, Gale began using the stage name Ro Ransom. He had also considered \"Young Coyote\" as his pseudonym. That year, he released the track \"Even The Devil May Cry\" and appeared on the Ricky Hil song \"Varieties\". In 2012, he released a remix of the Purity Ring song \"Odebear\". He followed that with his first mixtape using the Ro Ransom moniker, Ransomnia. That collection featured the single \"Deadman Wonderland\" and guest appearances from Trae tha Truth, Casey Veggies, 10ille, and Ricky Hil.
