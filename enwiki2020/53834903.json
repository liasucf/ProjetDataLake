    "text": "Focused deterrence (also known as pulling-levers policing) is a crime prevention strategy which aims to deter crime by increasing the swiftness, severity and certainty of punishment for crimes by implementing a mix of law enforcement, social services, and community mobilization. This approach also aims to identify underlying causes of gun injury-related problems and tailors specific solutions to each of them.
