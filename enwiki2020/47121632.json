It is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. The painting was created and sent from Rome, and it was so successful that many copies of the original were eventually made. The painting is a remarkable example of the Spanish historical painting genre. It obtained the medal of honor in the National Exposition of Fine Arts (Spanish: Exposici\u00f3n Nacional de Bellas Artes) of 1878, as well as having success in the Universal Expositions of Paris in 1878, as well as that of Berlin. In the painting, Pradilla represents Joanna of Castile watching over the casket of her dead husband, Philip I of Castile. She stands upright with an expression of emptiness on her lean face and hands clenched at her side. Around her, the courtiers gather with varied expressions. Philip I of Castile died suddenly of typhoid fever, and it was said she carried his casket around with her everywhere, believing one day he would wake from slumber. This depicts a common ritual for her, and the courtiers faces all have looks of boredom and fatigue. The effects of lighting have been described as reminiscent of Rembrandt. Perhaps most admirable about the painting and what impresses professionals most however, is the skill of the composition in portraying the harmoniously arranged surrounding figures and the resulting mood that is created. ==References== Category:1877 paintings Category:Paintings of the Museo del Prado by Spanish artists Category:Paintings about death Category:Cultural depictions of Joanna of Castile Category:Cultural depictions of Spanish kings ",
