The university held 30,000 students and academicians during the 2nd century. This provided the Han dynasty with well-educated bureaucrats to fill civil service posts in the imperial government. The first nationwide government school system in China was established in 3 CE under Emperor Ping of Han, with the Taixue located in the capital of Chang'an and local schools established in the prefectures and in the main cities of the smaller counties.Yuan, 193-194. The Sui dynasty instituted major reforms, giving the imperial academy a greater administrative role and renaming it the Guozijian (\u570b\u5b50\u76e3).http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/english/panels/ed/papers/711e01.pdf A Consultant Report to The University Grants Committee of Hong Kong As the Guozijian, the institution was maintained by successive dynasties until it was finally abolished in 1905 near the end of the Qing dynasty. Taixue taught Confucianism and Chinese literature among other things for high level civil service posts, although a civil service system based upon competitive examination rather than recommendation was not introduced until the Sui and did not become a mature system until the Song dynasty (960-1279).http://www.education.monash.edu.au/centres/mcrie/docs/conferencekeynotes/yang- china-higher-ed-massification-mexico.pdf Higher Education in the People\u2019s Republic of China: Historical Traditions, Recent Developments and Major IssuesEbrey, CIHC, 145-146. ==See also== *Academies (Shuyuan) *Ancient higher- learning institutions *Shang Xiang *Guozijian ==References== ===Notes=== ===General references=== *Ebrey, Patricia Buckley (1999).
