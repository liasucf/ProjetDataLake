    "text": "Abdul Hamid Karami (23 October 1890 - 23 November 1950) () was a Lebanese political and religious leader, who had nationalistic Arab inclinations. ==Background and career== Karami descended from one of the most prominent Sunni Muslim families in Lebanon. Members of his family traditionally held the position of mufti of Tripoli. Abdul Hamid Karami became mufti of Tripoli, but was removed by the French authorities. He was a leader of the movement to have Lebanon become an independent country, a goal which was achieved by 1943. In 1944, Karami survived an assassination attempt, which was due to local rivalry in Tripoli. Karami served as prime minister and finance minister of Lebanon for a brief period from 10 January 1945 to 20 August 1945. His sons, Rashid Karami and Omar Karami were also important Lebanese politicians who served as prime ministers and leadind politicians of Lebanon. Karami died in 1950. ===Controversy=== In June 1935, Karami killed Abdul Majid Muqaddam, another prominent Tripoli native, since Muqaddam had beaten him with a stick and knocked off his turban. However, Karami was acquitted due to his claim of self-defense. Karami's lawyer was future president Bishara Khoury. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of Lebanon Category:Lebanese Sunni Muslims Category:Members of the Parliament of Lebanon Category:Government ministers of Lebanon Category:People from Tripoli, Lebanon Category:Finance ministers of Lebanon ",
