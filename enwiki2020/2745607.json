    "text": "There are many instances in popular culture in which fictional underground stations appear. In many cases for film or television, actual stations are used for the purpose of filming. ==Fictional London Underground stations== Aldwych in London * Belgravia \u2013 1960 film Piccadilly Third Stop. * Blackwall \u2013 featured in the TV drama series London's Burning. * Bloomsbury \u2013 1934 film Bulldog Jack. *:The film features a chase/fight scene in a disused Bloomsbury station on the Central line, connected to the British Museum by a secret tunnel. A map is seen on the wall of the train in the climax scene, involving a race through the tunnels on a runway tube train. The map lists the stations between Ealing Broadway and Liverpool Street from top to bottom, and includes \"Bloomsbury\", between the now-closed British Museum and Chancery Lane, in place of Holborn, as well as a fictional High Holborn station located in- between Chancery Lane and Post Office (now St Paul's). In an absence of continuity, the map later changes to another, where the order is reversed, with Liverpool Street at the top and, \"Western Avenue\" is at the bottom. This different map includes a number of fictional stations in place of the real station names. It now reads: Liverpool Street, Bank, Post Office (now St Paul's), Holborn, Bloomsbury, New Oxford Street, Langham (presumably a reference to Langham Place near Oxford Circus), Cavendish Street, Cumberland (presumably a reference to the Cumberland Gate of Hyde Park), Gloucester Gate, Campden Hill, Kensington Park, Holland Road, White City (which was yet to be built in 1935), North Perivale, East Perivale, and Western Avenue, where the chase terminates. The station names at the end of this fictional version of the Central line reflect the locations of some of the stations that would later form the extension of the Central line towards West Ruislip. Bloomsbury was the initial name considered for British Museum station but was dropped before the station opened. * Camden Road \u2013 Appeared in the film The Gentle Gunman; footage later reused in the 1969 ITV television programme Strange Report. * Charnham \u2013 TV soap Family Affairs. * Crouch End \u2013 2004 film Shaun of the Dead featured a deleted scene (included on the DVD). *:The title character (played by Simon Pegg) attempted to catch a tube to work from the station only to find it closed. A special 'Crouch End' tube station sign was made for the film scene and, according to Pegg's DVD commentary, is now mounted in his own bedroom. Under an abandoned part of the Underground's 1930s Northern Heights plan the real life Crouch End main line station would have transferred to the Northern line. The station closed in 1954 without the transfer taking place (see also: List of former and unopened London Underground stations). * Duchess Street \u2013 featured in the 1932 Jack Hulbert film Love on Wheels. * Ginners Park - station used as a shelter in an air raid in the 1942 film Unpublished Story starring Richard Greene and Valerie Hobson. * Haggerston \u2013 Appeared as an abandoned, sub-surface station in The New Statesman episode, \"Waste Not Want Not\". *:It should not be confused with the real Haggerston railway station in East London. This station is on an elevated section of the London Overground; it re-opened in 2010, but was disused when the programme was made. * Hanover Street \u2013 1979 film Hanover Street, starring Harrison Ford. Walt Disney Studios, Disneyland Resort Paris * Hayne Street \u2013 Mock-up found in the Disneyland Paris Disney Studios \"Studio Tram Tour\" inspired by the film Reign of Fire (2002); the film did not include a completed/named station. * Hickory Road \u2013 in Hickory Dickory Dock, Agatha Christie novel. *:Hickory Dickory Dock, one of Agatha Christie's detective stories featuring Hercule Poirot, is set in Hickory Road in London. A version of the story was made by Carnival Films for London Weekend Television's \"Poirot\" series. First broadcast in February 1995, the start of the programme sees the main characters alighting from an Underground train and exiting from Hickory Road station. The climax of the programme also involves a chase around the fictional station. * High Street - 1954 film The Good Die Young with Laurence Harvey. Locations in Barbican/Farringdon area. * Hobbs End \u2013 1958\u201359 BBC serial Quatermass and the Pit and the 1967 film version. *:Featured a tube station called Hobbs End. The station is located at the end of the non-existent 'Hobbs Lane'. One shot shows a new street nameplate reading \"Hobbs Lane\", and indicating it as being in the W10 postal district. Next to it a much older nameplate reading \"Hob's Lane\". Hob is an old name for the Devil. The name Hobbs End has more recently been used by London Underground as one of the stations on The Model Railway training simulator at the West Ashfield Underground station training facility.IanVisits: London Underground\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d tube station \"Oh, and I slightly squealed when I noticed one of the stations is called Hobbs End. Sci- Fi film geeks may get the reference.\" *Lewisham, Ladywell, Edge of the World and Catford \u2013 An episode of LWT comedy series End of Part One *:The main characters watch a film called \"The Life of Christopher Columbus\". In the film, Columbus goes to a tube station and asks for a train to America but is told he can go only as far as Catford. Part of a modified tube map is shown which shows the fictitious tube stations Lewisham, Ladywell, Edge of the World and Catford on the East London Section of the Metropolitan line south from New Cross station. There is an actual part of the mainline Mid-Kent Railway that interchanges with New Cross station, and the stations are, southwards in order: St. John's, Lewisham, Ladywell and Catford Bridge (Catford on a different line interchanges with the latter). * Marble Hill \u2013 seen at the beginning of the 1991 Poirot: Wasps' Nest, adapted from the novel by Agatha Christie. In reality, Arnos Grove Underground station was used as the location. * Museum \u2013 1972 film Death Line and computer game Beneath a Steel Sky. (See also: the real British Museum station) * North Atwood \u2013 2011 video game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. * Park Street \u2013 1948 film The Passionate Friends. * Queen's Arcade \u2013 Doctor Who episode Rose. * Rumbaloo Line \u2013 Tube line in Joan Aiken's children's book, Arabel's Raven. * Scratch Row \u2013 an abandoned tube station in Wireless Theatre's Victorian-set fantasy-adventure audio series, The Springheel Saga. * Sumatra Road \u2013 featured in \"The Empty Hearse,\" the first episode of the third series of the British TV crime drama Sherlock. *:The station's name is an allusion to \"The Giant Rat of Sumatra\", mentioned in the original Sherlock Holmes stories. It is fictionally located between Westminster and St. James's Park, underneath the Houses of Parliament. In the story, the station was partially constructed but never opened, being similar to North End. The scenes were shot at Aldwych Underground station. * Sun Hill \u2013 Long-running ITV police drama, The Bill. Station roundel prop of Union Street, in situ at Holborn tramway station * Union Street \u2013 featured in the 2008 film The Escapist and filmed on location in Holborn tramway station. Altered versions of Harry Beck's 1941 map were produced for the film, showing the station located between Borough and Elephant & Castle, close to the position of London's real Union Street. Vauxhall Cross, the fictional Tube station featured in James Bond films * Vauxhall Cross \u2013 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day. *:A supposed closed station on a disused branch of the Piccadilly line (similar to Aldwych) that runs south of the river to Vauxhall Cross, in the vicinity of the MI6 building. In fact, the Piccadilly line does not cross the river at all, although Vauxhall on the Victoria line is within about 100 metres. * Walford East \u2013 BBC TV soap Eastenders. *:The BBC soap opera EastEnders created Walford East Underground station, which replaces Bromley-by-Bow on the EastEnders tube map, to allow the locals to escape \"up West\" for a night out. Neither Walford nor the tube station exists \u2013 except on the EastEnders set. Most of the platform and train shots are filmed at East Finchley. A station at Walford West has also been referenced by characters in the show. * Wells Lane \u2013 BBC Spooks Series 5 Episode 7 *:An episode of the BBC series Spooks (broadcast 23 October 2006) featured a fictional disused Underground station called Wells Lane. * West Ashfield \u2013 see West Ashfield Underground station. * Westbourne Oak \u2013 the 2014 film Paddington.

(undetermined location but evidently within the city limits, unlike the real Main L station which is located in Evanston, Illinois). ==Fictional Manchester Metrolink stations== * Weatherfield North tram stop \u2013 introduced into the Granada Television soap opera Coronation Street in 2018. ==Fictional New York City Subway stations== *Lafayette Street \u2013 In Knowing, a major collision occurs between a 6 and a 4 train at Lafayette Street station. The front entrance sign says that Lafayette is served by the 4, 5, 6, J/Z, and M trains, making the real station either Canal Street or Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 City Hall (M trains still run on Nassau Street Line at this time).\"Knowing\u2019 crew lets you in on the secrets of that subway crash,\" by Patrick Kevin Day (Los Angeles Times; March 26, 2009) *Morningside \u2013 an upper Manhattan subway stop from the pilot episode of CBS's NYC 22. *Roscoe Street \u2013 a stop from the opening levels of Max Payne. Served by the 2, 4, and 5 trains, it may be inspired by the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station. *Kings Plaza \u2013 a subway stop in Brooklyn at the end of the V train ==Fictional Washington, D.C. Metro stations== *Cathedral Heights \u2013 The second season premiere of Netflix's House of Cards features a scene inside the Cathedral Heights station of the Washington Metro.

The scene was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina. *Georgetown \u2013 In No Way Out, a chase scene is depicted as passing through a Georgetown station in the Washington Metro. There is no Georgetown station; the nearest Metro station to Georgetown is Foggy Bottom. The interior of the station depicted in the movie was in the Baltimore Metro Subway and not Washington's. ==References== ===Sources=== * ==See also== *List of fictional railway stations ==External links== * Going Underground's \u2013 London Underground in Film and TV * Nick Cooper's \u2013 London Underground in Film and TV \\+ Rapid transit stations Category:Rapid transit stations Fictional stations ",
