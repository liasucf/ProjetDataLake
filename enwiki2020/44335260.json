Astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt landed north of it in 1972, on the Apollo 17 mission, but did not visit it. The astronauts referred to it simply as Hess during the mission. Hess is adjacent to the similarly-sized crater Mackin. To the north is Camelot, to the northwest are Shorty and Lara, and to the west is Nansen. To the northeast is Emory. The crater was named by the astronauts after geologist Harry Hammond Hess.The Valley of Taurus-Littrow, Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal, Corrected Transcript and Commentary Copyright 1995 by Eric M.
