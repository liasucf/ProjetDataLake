He represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 along with Debrah Scarlett with his song \"A Monster Like Me\". ==Career== M\u00f8rland fronted the band Absent Elk from its 2008 inception, releasing the album Caught in the Headlights in the spring of 2009. The band supported The Script, The Hoosiers and Girls Aloud on UK tours before going on to tour the UK themselves in June 2009. In 2015 M\u00f8rland wrote \"A Monster Like Me\", and performed it at Melodi Grand Prix as a duet with Debrah Scarlett. They won the competition with 88,869 votes and represented in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Vienna. The duo performed in the second semi-final and qualified to the final on 23 May 2015, in which they placed 8th. In January 2018, he was credited as the writer and producer of Melodi Grand Prix 2018 entry \"Who We Are\" performed by 19 year old singer Rebecca. The song competed at the Oslo Spektrum on 10 March 2018, and finished in 2nd place behind the eventual winner Alexander Rybak. M\u00f8rland returned to Melodi Grand Prix as an artist in 2019, with the self-written song \"En livredd mann\". The song competed in the final in Oslo Spektrum on 2 March 2019, but did not advance from the first round. In the same contest, he was also credited as a writer of Adrian J\u00f8rgensen song \"Bubble\", alongside Jonas McDonnell and Aleksander Walmann. The song placed second behind Keiino song \"Spirit in the Sky\". In February 2020, he was credited as a writer and composer of the song \"Attention\" by Ulrikke Brandstorp, alongside Brandstorp herself and Christian Ingebrigtsen. The song competed in the grand final of Melodi Grand Prix 2020 at Trondheim Spektrum on 15 February 2020, winning with 200,345 votes, and was therefore selected to represent in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam. However, on 18 March 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Make a Sail | * Released: May 27, 2016 * Label: Morland Music * Format: digital download |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| M\u00f8rland | * Released: April 8, 2013 * Format: digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NOR ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| AUT ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWI |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Keep Me Dancing\" | 2013 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | rowspan=\"5\"| Make a Sail |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"A Monster Like Me\" (with Debrah Scarlett) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2015 | 23 || 17 || 92 || 45 | * IFPI NOR: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"No Firewall\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Skin\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2016 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Make a Sail\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Leo\" | 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | rowspan=\"3\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"If Music Could Save You\"If Music Could Save You - Single by M\u00f8rland on iTunes Music (US) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"En livredd mann\"En livredd mann - Single by M\u00f8rland on iTunes Music (US) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |} ==See also== * Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 ==References== ==External links== Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2015 Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Norway Category:1980 births Category:Norwegian male singers Category:Norwegian pop singers Category:People from Grimstad Category:Living people Category:Melodi Grand Prix contestants Category:Melodi Grand Prix winners Category:Melodi Grand Prix composers Category:Norwegian expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:21st-century Norwegian singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
