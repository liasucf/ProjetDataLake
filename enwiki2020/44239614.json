Since 2002, Rimoin has been working in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where she founded the UCLA-DRC Health Research and Training program to train U.S. and Congolese epidemiologists to conduct high-impact infectious disease research in low-resource, logistically-complex settings. Her research there has yielded several important discoveries including the emergence of monkeypox since the cessation of smallpox vaccination, and novel strains of Simian Foamy Virus in humans. Her work led to fundamental understandings of the long-term consequence of Ebolavirus infection in the oldest known cohorts of Ebolavirus. == Early life and education == Rimoin's parents are Maryann Rimoin and David Rimoin, a highly regarded Canadian-American physician noted for his contributions to research in the genetics of dwarfism and inheritable diseases.Dr. David Rimoin, pioneering geneticist, dies at 75 Rimoin went on to receive her Bachelor of Arts degree in African History at Middlebury College, her Masters in Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Fielding School of Public Health, and her PhD at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
