It also has a score of 8.9/10 on Douban, becoming one of the highest rated dramas. Television producer and critic Xie Xiaohu credits the success of \u201cYu Zui\u201d to the unique character of its protagonist, who differs from the usual straight-laced, incorruptible police officers; and the show's attention-grabbing and lewd content. The background of the original writer Chang Shuxin, who was jailed decades ago and thus has a good understanding of police officers, also contributed to the success of the show. Despite the show's success, the series was later taken off the internet. Numerous sources have pointed to China\u2019s media regulation body, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television (SAPPRFT), who banned the show for its explicit content. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
