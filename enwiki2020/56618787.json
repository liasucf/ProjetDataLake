    "text": "I Can See Your Voice (abbreviated as ICSYV, and also stylized as I Can See Your Voice \u2014 Mystery music game show) () is an international television mystery music game show franchise. It is based on the South Korean program of the same name. ==Gameplay== Presented with a group of \"mystery singers\", a guest artist must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group without ever hearing them sing, assisted by clues and \"celebrity panelists\" over the course of each round. The guest artist must eliminate one to two mystery singers at the end of each round and then proceeding to perform on the \"stage of truth\". At the end, the winning mystery singer is revealed as good or bad \u2014 by means of a duet with one of the guest artists. The guest artist wins the game if a good singer remains at the end of the show. The remaining mystery singer receives a special prize. In other franchises, a noncelebrity plays the game. The contestant gets a prize money for every bad singer eliminated. At the penultimate round, he/she may choose to walk away with the money if he/she thinks that the last mystery singer is a bad singer, or risk the money for a chance to take home the jackpot prize, otherwise. ==Rounds== The original format of this game consists of three rounds with varying mechanics. ===Singer's visual=== *The guest artist is given some time to observe and examine each mystery singer based on their appearance. After this, a muted video of each mystery singer that reveals only 0.3 seconds of their singing voice is played as an additional hint. *Each mystery singer is given two identities \u2013 as a good singer and as a bad singer. Only one of them is their real identity. ===Singer's lip-sync=== *Every mystery singer lip-syncs to a song. Good singers lip-sync to their own voice, while bad singers lip-sync to other's voices. *A mystery singer and a substitute lip-sync to a song together. Only one of them is the owner of the voice. *The mystery singer lip- syncs to the good singer's voice, then a bad singer's voice comes in the middle of the performance. ===Singer's evidence=== In this round, each mystery singer shows an evidential piece with different methods. Good singers have their own evidences while bad singers had their evidences fabricated. *A proof of each mystery singer's singing ability (i.e. photo, video, certificates, etc.) is shown on the screen. *Three randomly selected panelists must hear the mystery singer's singing voice using a headphone for a limited time. Afterwards, he or she must defend the mystery singer and convince the guest artist to choose him/her as the final mystery singer. *The hosts of the show have randomly assigned clues about the mystery singer. The guest artist must choose a clue for each mystery singer. *Each mystery singer has a video package to convince the guest artist, but with voices being distorted. == Reception == === Legacy === I Can See Your Voice served as a launchpad for mystery singers with successful careers, such as South Korean acts Hwang Chi- yeul, Lee Sun-bin, and Kim Min-kyu; and also foreign acts Sephy Francisco, Ninety One, and . === Controversies === In August 2015, CJ ENM accused two Chinese programs, God of Songs by SZTV and X-Singer by Beijing TV of plagiarism, which imitates its gameplay similar to ICSYV, therefore they were both unlicensed Chinese counterparts. Despite this, God of Songs became successful due to high ratings and even trending on social media.

Despite this, it was later adapted in China and France. ===Accolades=== I Can See Your Voice was nominated for Best Non-Scripted Entertainment Program category at the 44th International Emmy Awards alongside Gogglebox, Adotada, and eventual winner Allt f\u00f6r Sverige. ==International versions== Location of I Can See Your Voice versions: Due to its popularity in South Korea, it went on to become a television game show franchise, which was distributed worldwide by CJ ENM and several syndicated television productions.
