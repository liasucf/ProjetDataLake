    "text": "Peter-Paul Pigmans (January 31, 1961 - August 27, 2003) was a Dutch gabber music producer, best known for his production under the pseudonym 3 Steps Ahead. Born in Berkel and based out of Rotterdam, Pigmans' music is widely considered one of the most innovative specimens of the gabber genre;http://partyflock.nl/images/upload/914_original.jpg while many gabber producers favor raw force and little virtuosity when creating a song, Pigmans' music always had a strong technical side, and his songs often featured atmospherical elements, an unusual thing in the genre at the time. He was also known for his extremely wild live shows. Pigmans was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1999. On July 18, 2003 in Zaandam at the Hemkade stadium, fellow Dutch producers organized a fundraising event for him called \"3 Steps Ahead 4 Life\" where the cream of the Dutch gabber scene performed (for free - all income was spent on his treatment in hope of curing him) and paid respect to him.partyflock agenda: 3 Steps Ahead For Life \u00b7 18 juli 2003 A couple of weeks later, he died. Two months later the annual Thunderdome started with a one- minute silence in his memory.
