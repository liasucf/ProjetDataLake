    "text": "In geometry, a myriagon or 10000-gon is a polygon with 10,000 sides. Several philosophers have used the regular myriagon to illustrate issues regarding thought.Meditation VI by Descartes (English translation).Hippolyte Taine, On Intelligence: pp. 9\u201310Jacques Maritain, An Introduction to Philosophy: p. 108Alan Nelson (ed.), A Companion to Rationalism: p. 285Paolo Fabiani, The philosophy of the imagination in Vico and Malebranche: p. 222 == Regular myriagon== A regular myriagon is represented by Schl\u00e4fli symbol {10,000} and can be constructed as a truncated 5000-gon, t{5000}, or a twice-truncated 2500-gon, tt{2500}, or a thrice-truncated 1250-gon, ttt{1250), or a four-fold- truncated 625-gon, tttt{625}. The measure of each internal angle in a regular myriagon is 179.964\u00b0. The area of a regular myriagon with sides of length a is given by :A = 2500a^2 \\cot \\frac{\\pi}{10000} The result differs from the area of its circumscribed circle by up to 40 parts per billion. Because 10,000 = 24 \u00d7 54, the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular myriagon is not a constructible polygon. Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of neusis or an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes, nor a product of powers of two and three. == Symmetry== The symmetries of a regular myriagon. Light blue lines show subgroups of index 2. The 5 boxed subgraphs are positionally related by index 5 subgroups. The regular myriagon has Dih10000 dihedral symmetry, order 20000, represented by 10000 lines of reflection. Dih100 has 24 dihedral subgroups: (Dih5000, Dih2500, Dih1250, Dih625), (Dih2000, Dih1000, Dih500, Dih250, Dih125), (Dih400, Dih200, Dih100, Dih50, Dih25), (Dih80, Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), and (Dih16, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1). It also has 25 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z10000, Z5000, Z2500, Z1250, Z625), (Z2000, Z1000, Z500, Z250, Z125), (Z400, Z200, Z100, Z50, Z25), (Z80, Z40, Z20, Z10), and (Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, Z1), with Zn representing \u03c0/n radian rotational symmetry. John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.The Symmetries of Things, Chapter 20 r20000 represents full symmetry, and a1 labels no symmetry. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedom in defining irregular myriagons. Only the g10000 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges. ==Myriagram== A myriagram is a 10,000-sided star polygon. There are 1999 regular forms5000 cases - 1 (convex) - 1,000 (multiples of 5) - 2,500 (multiples of 2)+ 500 (multiples of 2 and 5) given by Schl\u00e4fli symbols of the form {10000/n}, where n is an integer between 2 and 5,000 that is coprime to 10,000. There are also 3000 regular star figures in the remaining cases. ==In popular culture== In the novella Flatland, the Chief Circle is assumed to have ten thousand sides, making him a myriagon. ==See also== * Chiliagon * Megagon ==References== Category:Polygons ",
