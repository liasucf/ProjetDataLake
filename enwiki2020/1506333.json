The museum, whose full name is McCord Museum of Canadian History, is located next to McGill University, in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\"McCord Museum\". The Canadian Encyclopedia. ==History== Totem urbain / histoire en dentelle, a Pierre Granche sculpture, museum exterior. On October 13, 1921, the McCord National Museum, as it was then called, moved to the former McGill Union building, designed by Percy Erskine Nobbs in the Arts and Crafts tradition. The collection was based on the McCord family collection. Since 1878, David Ross McCord had been adding to the already considerable collection assembled by his family since their arrival in Canada. Over the years, he developed the plan of founding a national history museum in Montreal, at that time Canada's metropolis. The building that now houses the museum was administered by McGill University for over sixty years, when it was the seat of the student government. After riots targeted at SSMU led to the building's storming and several executives being taken hostage, McGill University set out to build a more secure building, University Centre, the current seat of SSMU. Leading members of the community lent their support to the museum over the years. Today, the McCord Museum is supported by the governments of Canada, Quebec and Montreal, and by a large network of members, donors and sponsors. ==Collection== The museum was founded in 1921 by David Ross McCord, based on his own family collection of objects. Since then, the museum's holdings have increased substantially. ===Ethnology and Archaeology=== This collection of 15,800 objects documents many aspects of the ways of life, arts, cultures and traditions of the Aboriginal Canadians.
