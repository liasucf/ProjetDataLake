It offers bachelor's degrees, associate degrees, and continuing and professional education and certificates. == History == Dean College was founded by Dr. Oliver Dean as a co-educational academy in 1865. Dr. Dean was an enthusiastic benefactor of the academy and donated approximately nine acres of land for the site of the school and donated $125,000 towards its construction. After the groundbreaking ceremony held earlier in the year, the first class at Dean Academy began on October 1, 1866, with 44 students attending. The students held class in the local Universalist Church. Dean Hall, the main building of Dean Academy, was not finished until 1868. During the summer of 1872, Dean Hall was completely destroyed by fire, but reconstruction efforts began immediately. On June 7, 1874, the newly rebuilt Dean Hall was rededicated. The school mascot is a bulldog named Boomer. Notable alumni include Richard Belzer (John Munch on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) who was kicked out of Dean College when it was known as Dean Junior College. The founders of CVS Pharmacy, Sid Goldstein and Stanley Goldstein, and the founder of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Austin Barclay Fletcher, also attended Dean.
