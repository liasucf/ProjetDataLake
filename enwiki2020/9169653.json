It is run on the New Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 3 miles and 1\u00bd furlongs (3 miles 1 furlong and 156 yards, or 5,172 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year in January. The race was first run in 1980 as the Tote Double Chase, later the Timeform Hall of Fame Chase. The event serves as a trial for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which takes place at the same venue in March. It is held during Festival Trials Day, which features several other trials for races at the Cheltenham Festival. The event is registered as the Cotswold Chase, but it has usually been known by a sponsored title. The wine merchant Bibendum supported the race from 2010 to 2014, and its 2014 title promoted Argento, an Argentinian wine brand. From 2015 to 2019 the race was sponsored by the BetBright bookmaking firm. and since 2020 it has been sponsored by Paddy Power. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"36px\" | Year ! width=\"160px\" | Winner ! width=\"40px\" | Age ! width=\"180px\" | Jockey ! width=\"180px\" | Trainer |- |1980||Raffi Nelson||7||Steve Smith Eccles||Nicky Henderson |- |1981||Little Owl||7||Jim Wilson||Peter Easterby |- |1982||Lesley Ann||8||Colin Brown||David Elsworth |- |1983||Combs Ditch||7||Colin Brown||David Elsworth |- |1984||Everett||9||Stuart Shilston||Fulke Walwyn |- |1985||West Tip||8||Richard Dunwoody||Michael Oliver |- |1986||Misty Spirit||7||Steve Smith Eccles||D Lee |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1987Abandoned because of frost |- | 1988 | Twin Oaks | 8 | Paul Croucher | David Murray Smith |- | 1989 | Deep Moment | 7 | Dermot Browne | Mercy Rimell |- | 1990 | Toby Tobias | 8 | Mark Pitman | Jenny Pitman |- | 1991 | Celtic Shot | 9 | Peter Scudamore | Charlie Brooks |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1992| Abandoned because of frost |- | 1993 | Sibton Abbey | 8 | Steve Smith Eccles | Ferdy Murphy |- | 1994 | Dubacilla | 8 | Dean Gallagher | Henry Cole |- | 1995 | Master Oats | 9 | Norman Williamson | Kim Bailey |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1996| Abandoned because of frost |- | 1997 | One Man | 9 | Richard Dunwoody | Gordon W.
