    "text": "Man's Myth is the fourth album by Twiztid. Released on June 28, 2005, it is the first half of the Man's Myth/Mutant double album, released one month before its companion album, Mutant. In his review of the album, Allmusic's David Jeffries wrote that \"while the album doesn't have E-40 or Bushwick Bill guest shots like 2003's Green Book did, it reaches farther outside the suburban trash world of Psychopathic Records than anything the label has released previously. Twiztid keeps growing lyrically too and the album is edited tightly with little filler.\" Bonus Flavor is a cover of Luniz's \"I Got 5 On It (Remix).\" == Track listing == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\" width=\"30\"|# !align=\"center\" width=\"150\"|Title !align=\"center\" width=\"20\"|Time !align=\"center\" width=\"100\"|Producer(s) !align=\"center\" width=\"135\"|Performer(s) |- |1 |\"Introduction\" |2:23 | |- |2 |\"Karma\" |3:54 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |3 |\"Story of Our Lives\" |4:57 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky The R.O.C. |Twiztid |- |4 |\"Won't Die\" |3:27 |Lavel |Twiztid |- |5 |\"Get it Right\" |3:46 |Lavel |Twiztid |- |6 |\"So High\" |5:20 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky The R.O.C. |Twiztid Violent J Blaze Ya Dead Homie |- |7 |\"Off the Chain\" |2:41 |Lavel |Twiztid |- |8 |\"Controversy\" |3:40 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky The R.O.C. |Twiztid |- |9 |\"Get Ready\" |3:22 |Lavel |Twiztid Violent J |- |10 |\"Fuck U, Part 1\" |0:58 |Lavel |Twiztid |- |11 |\"Feel This\" |2:48 |Lavel |Twiztid |- |12 |\"Entity\" |4:06 |Lavel |Twiztid Shaggy 2 Dope |- |13 |\"The Argument\" |3:18 |Esham |Twiztid |- |14 |\"Bonus Flavor\" |4:15 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid Soopa Villainz Drive-By |} ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2005) !align=\"center\"|Peak Position |- |Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|62 |- |Top Independent Albums |align=\"center\"|4 |- |Top Rap Albums |align=\"center\"|14 |} == References == General * Specific Category:2005 albums Category:Twiztid albums Category:Albums produced by Esham Category:Psychopathic Records albums Category:Horrorcore albums ",
