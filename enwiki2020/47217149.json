The son would help design the gardens around the villa. The tall central structure has a porticoed courtyard with two recessed wings. The stables have columns (1755) decorated with Olympian gods or flower vases. The villa was frescoed by many artists, including Pietro Scalvini, Giancarlo Galli Bibiena, the quadraturist Battaglioli, Francesco Zuccarelli, and Carlo Carloni. The villa chapel was decorated by Francesco Savanni. The main altarpiece was completed by Giovanni Battista Pittoni. Among the sculptors working in the palace were Alessandro and Antonio Callegari, Lorenzo Muttoni, and Rodolfo Vantini.
