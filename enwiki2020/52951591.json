    "text": "Kevin Stefanski (born May 8, 1982) is an American football coach who is the head coach for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He previously spent over a decade serving in various capacities as an assistant coach for the Minnesota Vikings before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2019, and then taking the Browns job early in 2020. ==Early life and playing career== Stefanski graduated from St. Joseph's Preparatory School in 2000 and the University of Pennsylvania in 2004. Stefanski played football at the University of Pennsylvania. He won the Penn Freshman of the Year award in 2000. He was part of the only undefeated Penn team of the decade and was twice an All-Ivy League selection. ==Coaching career== ===Minnesota Vikings assistant=== Stefanski joined the Minnesota Vikings in 2006 as an assistant to former head coach Brad Childress. In 2017, after the termination of Scott Turner, Stefanski was promoted to coach the Vikings quarterbacks, where he helped transform the Vikings into the NFL's 10th-highest scoring offense. Quarterback Case Keenum had his best season under Stefanski, throwing 22 touchdown passes and only seven interceptions. He previously worked with the running backs in 2016 and the tight ends in 2014 and 2015. After the 2017 season, the New York Giants requested to interview and hire Stefanski as their new offensive coordinator, but Vikings denied the request. After offensive coordinator John DeFilippo was fired following a 21\u20137 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Stefanski was named interim offensive coordinator. On January 9, 2019, Stefanski was promoted to full-time offensive coordinator. ===Cleveland Browns=== On January 13, 2020, Stefanski signed a 5-year contract to become the 18th head coach of the Cleveland Browns, two days after the Minnesota Vikings lost in the NFC playoffs. On September 13, 2020, Stefanski lost his head coaching debut to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 38\u20136. The loss marked the 16th consecutive week one without a win for the Browns, whose week one record since 2004 is 0\u201315\u20131. On September 17, 2020, Stefanski received his first career win as a head coach in the 35\u201330 win against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday Night Football. ==Head coaching record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !
