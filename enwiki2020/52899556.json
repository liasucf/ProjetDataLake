Butchart presented the BBC Four's A Stitch in Time, a six part documentary series which \"explored the lives of historical figures through the clothes they wore\". She also presented a segment in the BBC Documentary series Civilisations Stories entitled The First Refugees regarding the silk-weaving Huguenot community of Spitalfields. She is an associate lecturer at the London College of Fashion, and was formerly head buyer for vintage clothing company Beyond Retro. She has an MA in History and Culture of Fashion from the London College of Fashion, now part of the University of the Arts London. Butchart also acts as a consultant forensic garment analyst to British police forces and crime scene investigators. Butchart is a regular guest on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour. In January 2017 she appeared on Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity where her hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was \"the colour mauve\". She has also produced a two-part documentary for Radio 4 about the history of the vintage fashion industry entitled From Rags to Riches. Since 2018, Butchart has presented English Heritage's series of historic make-up tutorials on its YouTube channel. The series was part of the charity's efforts to expand its audience, and the campaign led to English Heritage winning the 'Grand Prix' and 'Best UK Breakthrough Advertiser' prizes at the 2019 YouTube Works Awards. She regularly hosts fashion events, including Puttin\u2019 on the Glitz: Fashion & Film in the Jazz Age at the British Library in 2014.
