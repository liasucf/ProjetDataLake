Roberts studied foreign language education while attending the University of Georgia, where he graduated from in 1999. ===Real World=== Prior to beginning the show, he had recently begun a relationship with Paul Dill, a US Army captain stationed in Vicenza, Italy. Because of the U.S. Military \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy toward homosexuals, Paul's face was obscured on TV and much national attention was brought to the issue. In early 2004, MTV aired a special where Paul (then out of the military) revealed his face for the first time and the policy and its effects were discussed. In November 2006, Roberts announced in The Advocate magazine that he and Dill had split up. ===Post Real World=== Roberts made a few post-Real World appearances on television such as Dawson's Creek, Netflix's DTLA, and hosted the DVD collection of gay-themed short films, Boy's Briefs. Roberts spoke at schools across the country on diversity in sexuality, coming out, public policy, and the military's \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" policy for several years after his first TV appearance in addition to other LGBTQ advocacy work.Top 15 Gay REality Stars After Elton, April 5, 2009 After spending 10 years in New York and Seattle, Roberts returned to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked in human resource recruiting for an email software company called MailChimp, where he worked from 2014 until 2017.
