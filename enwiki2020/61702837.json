    "text": "Haplogroup D or D-CTS3946 is a Y-chromosome haplogroup. Both D-CTS3946 and E lineages also exhibit the single-nucleotide polymorphism M168 which is present in all Y-chromosome haplogroups except A and B, as well as the YAP+ unique- event polymorphism, which is unique to Haplogroup DE. Subclades of haplogroup D-CTS3946 are found primarily in East Asia, though they are also found regularly with low frequency in Central Asia and Southeast Asia, and have also been found sporadically in Western Africa and Western Asia. ==Overview== Proposed migration of haplogroup D according to Haber et al. Haplogroup D was formerly the name of the D lineage D-M174. However, a study (Haber et al. 2019) identified a haplogroup, termed \"D0\", in three Nigerian samples. The \"D0\" haplogroup is outside M174, but shares 7 SNPs with it that E lacks. The authors consider several possibilities, but in part because of the likely deep-rooting of haplogroup \"D0\", as well as recently calculated early divergence times for it and its parent haplogroup, DE, the authors conclude in favor of an African origin for D0 DE, as well as for the common ancestor (now known as D-CTS3946 or \"D\") of D0 and D-M174. According to Haber et al., D0 is a branch of the DE lineage near the DE split but on the D branch, diverging around 71,000 years ago. The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later, at around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups. Thus D-CTS3946 is proposed to have spread both within and outside of Africa: with one branch diverging into D0 in Africa, and another branch outside Africa eventually diverging into D-M174 (i.e. with the M174 mutation later arising from the D-CTS3946 that had spread to Asia). \"D0\" has also been named \"D2\", and former D (D-M174) has now also been termed \"D1\" due to this discovery. Three other samples of D2 were also found in West Asia (also in 2019): two in Saudi Arabia and another one in Syria. The sample found in Syria is to date the most basal sample of D2. The recent evidence (as also proposed by Haber et al.) suggests that D2 is a highly divergent haplogroup close to the DE split but on the D branch and lacking the M174 mutation possessed by the other known D lineages (belonging to its sibling D-M174). ==Phylogeny of the subclades== ISOGG (version: 14.151).Y-DNA Haplogroup D and its Subclades - 2019 *DE (YAP) **D (CTS3946) ***D1 (M174/Page30, IMS-JST021355) ****D1a (CTS11577) *****D1a1 (F6251/Z27276) ******D1a1a (M15) TibetHammer MF, Karafet TM, Park H et al.
