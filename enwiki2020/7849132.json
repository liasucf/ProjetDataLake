    "text": "The Australian five-dollar note was first issued on 29 May 1967, fifteen months after the currency was changed from the Australian pound to the Australian dollar on 14 February 1966. It was a new denomination with mauve colouration - the pound system had no \u00a32\u00bd note. ==Series == * The first issue was a paper note which had a gradient of mauve, with a distinct black overprint. It was designed by Gordon Andrews, with Russell Drysdale as the Reserve Bank of Australia's artistic advisor. It featured portraits of Sir Joseph Banks and Caroline Chisholm, as well as elevations of Sydney streets from Joseph Fowles' \"Sydney in 1848\", the cover of the Shipping Gazette, a watercolour of the Waverley, and a handbill of a meeting of the Family Colonization Loan Society. All of these images were sourced from the State Library of New South Wales. * The first Polym anknote issue, which can be recognised for its dmauve colouration and numeral font, was first issued in pale mauve in 1992. A number of people found it difficult to distinguish it from the $10 banknote, especially in poor lighting conditions. * In 1995, a second polymer issue was issued, distinguishable by its deeper shade of mauve and a different font for the numeral. * A federation commemorative was issued in 2001 for that year only. Notes featured Sir Henry Parkes on the obverse and Catherine Helen Spence on the reverse. * On 1 September 201e Next Generation Banknote (NGB) $5 was issued. The NGB series banknotes contain more security features than the previous series, including a clear top-to-bottom ==Statistics== According to Reserve Bank statistics, at the end of June 2017 there were 211 million $5 banknotes in circulation, 14% of the total banknotes in circulation; worth $1,055 million, or 1% of the total value for all denominations.[DISTRIBUTION-CIRCULATION AND PRODUCTION STATISTICS, AS AT END JUNE 2017\". banknotes.rba.gov.au.
