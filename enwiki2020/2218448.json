Towards the end of its heyday, the club witnessed the birth of a very different type of motorcycle club\u2014American-style outlaw motorcycle clubs, the rise of these groups, which tended to cater to an older, tougher crowd, was a contrast to the 59 way of life marking the end of the 1960s British Rocker sub-culture. This was followed by a period when Japanese motorcycles outnumber the old British irons, The subculture would not see a resurgence for almost a decade, but the legend of the 59 Club carried on with original members who were determined to keep the spirit of the 1950s alive with the ageing Ton- Up/Rocker scene. The Club relied on a new breed of modern Rockers on their newer bikes through the '80s and was very popular at its headquarters in Hackney Yorkton St. It has always carried its Rocker roots, with rock and roll still on the Jukebox as it is today. By the late 1980s, a Rockers revival was underway and a number of enthusiasts started a 'Classic Section' within the club, a sub-group of members dedicated to upholding the 1960s rockers subculture (the style, music, and motorcycles), this again died away until recently, but the 59 has never stopped attracting a mixed motorcycling membership many of whom are Rockers. ===Past leaders=== Reverend Graham Hullet, a leader of the 59 Club, with an original 59 Club member being interviewed by Dilly Barlow of BBC Radio 4 Home Truths Rev Bill Shergold, remembered as being like \"a father figure that many of the boys never had\", was the president until he died aged 89 in Wells, Somerset in May 2009.
