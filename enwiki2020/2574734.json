    "text": "St Ebbe's is a Church of England parish church in central Oxford. The church is within the conservative evangelical tradition and participates in the Anglican Reform movement. It has members from many nations, many of whom are students at Oxford University. The rector is Vaughan Roberts who is also an author and conference speaker. ==History== Norman period west door The church stands on the site of one dedicated to St \u00c6bbe before 1005. Most sources suggest that this was the Northumbrian St \u00c6bbe of Coldingham, but it has been suggested that \u00c6bbe of Oxford was a different saint. The name was first recorded in about 1005 when the church was granted to Eynsham Abbey by Ealdorman \u00c6thelm\u00e6r the Stout, when it was already recorded as the \"ancient St Ebbe's\".Victoria County History of Oxfordshire: Medieval Oxford. The present church was built in 1814\u201316. It was enlarged and improved in 1866 and 1904. A Norman doorway of the 12th century has been restored and placed at the west end.Alden's Oxford Guide. Oxford; Alden; 1958; p. 125. The church is the parish church for the parish of St Ebbes, a portion of which was demolished to make way for the nearby Westgate Shopping Centre in the 1970s. The church has a ministry among the remaining part of the parish, although most of its members live outside the parish. The church is a partner church of St Ebbe\u2019s Primary School, a school within the parish. ==Present day== St Ebbe's continues to be highly active, with three meetings each Sunday at 9:45, 4:30 and 6:30, with the additional of a fourth 11:45 service during term-time. There are also a range of mid-week groups. St Ebbe's is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership. == Ministers == === Rectors === * 15??-1550: Thomas Dobson * 1550-1553: Ralph Rudde; Principal of St Edmund Hall * 1553-1576: Vacant * 1576-1585: John Paule * 1589-1593: William Singleton * 1593-1604: John Hilliard * 1604-1631: Jacob Yate * 1631-1641: Edward Wyrley * 1643-1648: Hugh Boham; Chaplain of All Souls College * 1664-1666: Richard Tapping * 1690-1691: Thomas Shewring * 1695-1696: Josias Dockwray * 1696-1697: Henry Hellier * 1697-1707: William Baker; later the Bishop of Norwich * 1707-1714: John Knott * 1714-1719: Matthew Panting; Master of Pembroke College * 1719-1727: Bernard Peisley * 1727-1734: Thomas Hillman * 1736-1742: Nathaniel Bliss; later the fourth Astronomer Royal * 1742-1753: Thomas Camplin; Vice-Principal of St Edmund Hall and later the Archdeacon of Taunton * 1753-1771: Robert Ewings * 1771-1809: Henry Richards * 1808-1868: William Hambury; later Chaplain to George IV * 1868-1874: E.P.
