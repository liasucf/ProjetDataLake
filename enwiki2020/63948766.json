    "text": "Philippines's 9th senatorial district, officially the Ninth Senatorial District of the Philippine Islands (), was one of the twelve senatorial districts of the Philippines in existence between 1916 and 1935. It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the eastern Visayas provinces of Leyte and Samar. The district was represented by a total of six senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large. It was last represented by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Veloso and Jos\u00e9 Avelino of the Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico. ==List of senators== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=7 | Seat A | rowspan=99 | ! rowspan=3 | Legislature | rowspan=99 | ! colspan=7 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history |- !Start!!End !Start!!End |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Esteban Singson | rowspan=\"2\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1916. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4th | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 1 | style=\"background:;\" | | Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Veloso | October 16, 1916 | June 3, 1919 | Nacionalista | Elected in 1916. |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 5th | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Francisco Enage | rowspan=\"2\" | June 3, 1919 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1925 | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1919. |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background- color:#191970 | | rowspan=\"2\" | Tom\u00e1s G\u00f3mez | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | July 28, 1926 | Nacionalista Colectivista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1922.
