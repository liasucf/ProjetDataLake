    "text": "Khem Karan is a town and a nagar panchayat in Tarn Taran district of Patti tehsil of the Majha region of Indian state of Punjab. It was the site of a major tank battle in 1965. The Battle of Asal Uttar was the largest tank battle of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. The battle led to the creation of Patton Nagar (or Patton City/Graveyard) at the site of the battle viz, Khem Karan. ==History== Khem Karan is an old town. Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621\u20131675) visited it. It used to be in Lahore district before partition of British India in 1947. It became a part of Amritsar district after the partition. Now it is in Tarn Taran district. Many of the town's residents migrated from nearby villages in modern Pakistan between 1947 and 1965, such as Nathuwala, Qadiwind, Rohiwal, and Sehjra. The towns Muslim residents migrated primarily to the city of Kasur, 8 km away in Pakistan. The town used to be easily accessible to the city of Kasur, Pakistan only 8 km away, and to Ferozepur 35 km away, but since India and Pakistan enacted border controls in 1953, and further restricted travel in 1965, the residents of the Khem Karan have been essentially cut off from both towns - Kasur lies in Pakistan, while the road to Ferozepur cuts through Pakistan, resulting in a detour of an extra 70 kilometre's drive. The townpeople, and those from surrounding villages, must now travel a long distance to Patti, Amritsar or Tarn Taran to procure any major goods, causing great inconvenience, and economic stagnation. ==India- Pakistan war of 1965== The tank battles of 1965 form part of military history as the most intense armored battles between the end of World War II and the 1991 Gulf War. Close to a four hundred tanks, on both sides, took part in the pitched battles and offensives. At the start of the war, Indian strength was limited to one armored division and one independent armoured brigade, along with six armoured regiments supporting infantry divisions. Pakistan had two armored divisions, with the then very modern M-48 Patton tanks. India had an equivalent tank in the Centurion, but their strength was limited to only four armored regiments. ==Demographics== India census, Khem Karan had a population of 13,446. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Khem Karan has an average literacy rate of 61.55%, lower than the state average of 75.84%: male literacy is 67%, and female literacy is 54.85%. In Khem Karan, 12.14% of the population is under 6 years of age. ==Places of interest== In this village is the mausoleum (mazaar) of a Sufi saint known as Pir Baba Sheikh Brahm. Twice in a year a mela is held here. === Agriculture === Khemkaran is mostly an agricultural village. ==References== Category:Battles of Indo-Pakistani wars Category:Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 Category:Cities and towns in Tarn Taran district ",
