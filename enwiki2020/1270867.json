The brief to the writers was clear \u2013 a situation comedy makes people laugh.... Under Sue Woodford the mission to complain was subverted. There were two clear strategic objectives which emerged from Channel 4. More people from the ethnic communities should be making programmes, serving an apprenticeship if necessary. There were, inevitably headcounts of the number of ethnic faces appeared on-screen as newsreaders, reporters, presenters or actors. A fair volume of programming of diverse sorts would ensure or at least begin the assimilation of the new communities into the nation's primary instrument or mirror of self-awareness.\"Farrukh Dhondy, \"Is the BBC still 'hideously white'?\", New Statesman, 18 March 2014. ===Consultancy and voluntary work=== She has been involved throughout her life with many campaigns for human rights and diversity.
