The coat of arms was established by the Lublin City Council on 8 July 2004.Uchwa\u0142a Nr 465/XXI/2004 Rady Miasta Lublin z dnia 8 lipca 2004 r. w sprawie ustanowienia herbu, flagi Miasta Lublin, flagi urz\u0119dowej Miasta Lublin i hejna\u0142u Miasta Lublin (Dz. Urz. Woj. Lubelskiego z 2004 r. Nr 149, poz. 2107) The coat of arms depicts a silver goat with golden corrugated horns and golden hooves, placed in a red field facing to the right, climbing from green grass to a green wine bush. ==Symbols== The goat and the vine were attributes of the goddess Venus (which means the fertility of nature), from whom Julia (according to a legend quoted by Wincenty Kadlubek), the founder of the city, originated. The goat is also a symbol of love and Christ. The red background symbolizes strength and power. ==History== The oldest image of the Lublin coat of arms comes from a document dated 1401 with the seal of the Lublin City Council. The document itself probably dates back to the 14th century. == References == Lublin Category:Lublin Lublin ",
