Greg Valentine had also held the WWF Tag Team Championship with Brutus Beefcake as one half of The Dream Team. ===Team=== In 1988, The Hart Foundation turned face and started a feud with former manager Jimmy Hart for picking The Fabulous Rougeaus over them. Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine teamed up (under the team name of \u201cDouble Trouble,\u201c though the announcers rarely used this name) to defend Jimmy Hart through the early parts of 1989 with the two teams facing off at WrestleMania V with the Hart Foundation winning the match. After the loss Honky Tonk Man and Valentine focused on singles feuds with \"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka and \u201dRugged\u201d Ronnie Garvin respectively. After the Fabulous Rougeaus left the WWF, Jimmy Hart reunited the Hammer and the Honky Tonk Man, gave them the team name \u201cRhythm and Blues,\u201d and made changes to Greg Valentine\u2019s appearance. Valentine had always been a blonde, ungimmicked wrestler who favored the traditional wrestling robe, but when teamed with the Honky Tonk Man, Valentine\u2019s hair got dyed jet black, he was given Elvis style shades, a white jacket and a guitar he quite obviously did not know how to play. Commentator Gorilla Monsoon nicknamed Greg Valentine \u201cBoxcar\u201d when he saw his changed appearance (most likely after Blues singer \u201cBoxcar Willie\u201d). As a commentator, Roddy Piper once opined \"Elvis would be turnin' over in his grave if he was dead.\" In an interview for World Wrestling Insanity, the Honky Tonk Man states the team name was a suggestion made by Rick Rude. Perhaps their most memorable moment came at WrestleMania VI when they were driven to the ring in a pink Cadillac driven by the then unknown Diamond Dallas Page. In the ring, they debuted their new song, \"Hunka Hunka Honky Love\"; the song was interrupted by The Bushwhackers who attacked them and broke their guitars much to the delight of the fans. The two teams had a lengthy feud over the summer of 1990 before Rhythm and Blues challenged the tag team champions the Hart Foundation for the titles during the fall. The team had several shots at the gold but came up short every time. At the 1990 Survivor Series, Rhythm and Blues partnered with Ted DiBiase on his \"Million Dollar Team\" along with the debuting Undertaker, taking on Dusty Rhodes' \"Dream Team\" of the Hart Foundation and Koko B. Ware. DiBiase would go on to be the only survivor for his team. ===Break up=== Near the end of 1990 the Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine started arguing when Greg Valentine got tired of Jimmy Hart\u2019s interference in their matches. This was supposed to lead to a feud between Greg Valentine and the Honky Tonk Man but the Honky Tonk Man left the federation in January 1991 thus nullifying the feud. At some point after both men left the WWF the team reunited in the Northern States Wrestling Alliance where they won the tag team titles once. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Northern States Wrestling Alliance **NSWA Tag Team Championship ==See also== *The Blond Bombers ==References== ==External links== *The official website of Greg Valentine *WWE Hall of Fame Profile: Greg Valentine *Honky Tonk Man interview on WWE.com Category:WWE teams and stables ",
