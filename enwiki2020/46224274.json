EmmaSofia was founded in 2015 by researchers P\u00e5l-\u00d8rjan Johansen and his wife, Teri Krebs. Teri Krebs is a former research fellow at the Department of Neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. P\u00e5l-\u00d8rjan Johansen is a clinical psychologist who has spoken out about having self-medicated with psilocybin and MDMA to treat his PTSD and alcoholism. Both researchers are known for their studies on the use of LSD to treat alcoholism,http://www.ntnu.edu/news/2012-news/lsd as well as a meta-analysis of 130,000 randomly chosen people, including 22,000 people who had used LSD, peyote or psilocybin mushrooms at least once. The latter study led them to conclude that there was no link between these psychedelics and mental health problems and that in fact, they found some significant associations between the use of psychedelic drugs and fewer mental health problems.http://www.ntnu.edu/news/2013-news/lsd-survey According to Johansen, the ban on psychedelics goes against human rights because the substances are less harmful than other common activities and because psychedelics play an important role in belief, spiritual practice, personality development and leisure. == References == ==Further reading== * * * * * * == External links == * http://www.emmasofia.org/ Category:Drug culture Category:Organisations based in Oslo Category:Psychedelic drug advocates ",
