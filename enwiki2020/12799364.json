The eleven- year-old likewise was accepted as an apprentice and later went on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he attended painting lessons with Heinrich F\u00fcger. He returned to work at the factory as one of the leading painters. From 1809 he worked only on portraits, specializing in miniature painting on ivory, and small gouaches on paper. In 1812 was employed as a portraitist by the Austrian Foreign Minister Klemens von Metternich and became curator of the extensive portrait collection of Metternich's third wife Princess Melanie. In 1819 he painted a portrait of Metternich's daughter, Klementine, posed as the goddess Hebe. He was influenced by Jean-Baptiste Isabey and even more strongly by the English portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, who visited Vienna in 1819. In his late years he concentrated on the painting of flowers. Daffinger died in 1849 during a cholera epidemic in Vienna and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery. In 1912 his mortal remains were transferred to a grave of honor () in the Vienna Zentralfriedhof. Daffinger left more than a thousand portraits, many of which were owned by the Austrian imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine. His portrait graced the obverse of the Austrian 20-schilling banknote that circulated until the introduction of the euro in 1999. ==Gallery== File:Moritz Daffinger - Kekropsove h\u010derke najdejo Erihtonija.jpg|Detail from a Vienna porcelain tray painted by Daffinger, after 1808, Cecrops' Daughters Discover Erichtonius File:Moritz Michael Daffinger 001.JPG |Portrait of Countess Ferdinandine Karolyi, ==External links== * * ==References== Category:1790 births Category:1849 deaths Category:Austrian painters Category:Austrian male painters Category:Austrian sculptors Category:Austrian male sculptors Category:Artists from Vienna ",
