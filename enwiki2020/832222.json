    "text": "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate is a 1996 American black comedy-romance film directed and co-written by Martin Lawrence, who also stars in the film. Lawrence co-wrote the screenplay alongside Kenny Buford and Bentley Kyle Evans, who has also written for Lawrence's hit television sitcom, Martin, and Kim Bass. In addition to Lawrence, the film's cast includes Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown, and Della Reese. The film tells the story of Darnell Wright, a ladies' man who finds himself targeted by one of his obsessed lovers. The film was released on April 1996 and went on to gross over $30 million at the box office against a budget of $8 million. The film was shot on location entirely in the city of Los Angeles, California, from June 5 until August 11, 1995. The title for the film is taken from the 1971 song \"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\" by The Persuaders. R&B; trio H-Town recorded a cover version of this song that was included on the film soundtrack. The movie is comparable to Fatal Attraction. ==Plot== Nightclub manager Darnell Wright (Martin Lawrence) is a perpetual playboy and hopeless male chauvinist. He works for a nightclub called Chocolate City and aspires to be its owner. He trades VIP privileges at the club for favors from women. Though he is an expert at conning women, he sometimes worries about what his childhood sweetheart Mia (Regina King) thinks of his adventures. When the classy and elegant Brandi Webb (Lynn Whitfield) steps out of a limousine to enter the club, Darnell feels that he's met his ultimate prize. She rejects his come- ons, which only fuels his appetite. He pursues her, showing up with flowers at her real estate . He finally wins over Brandi, only to find out that he's really in love with Mia. One morning, Darnell wakes up to find Brandi in the kitchen making bacon and pancakes. She wants him to hold her but he pushes her off aggressively. But Brandi doesn't take kindly to rejection. She becomes an obsessed femme fatale stalking him, even taking all four wheels off his SUV to ground him from his rounds, shattering his windshield and setting his nightclub on fire. In one scene, she hits herself with a fruit hidden in a sock to cause bruises without fingerprints. When Darnell goes to see her at the hospital, he is arrested for a false domestic violence charge. She also threatens Mia's life. Ending his relationship with Mia is not enough to satisfy Brandi who finally administers Darnell's punishment for his misogyny. Darnell quickly learns the hard way that when you \"play\", you have to \"pay.\" The film ends much like the last verse of the song \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\", with an injured Darnell in the hospital with all his friends and family as well as Mia standing over him. He ponders over what happened to him and deciding to change, and a mugshot of Brandi and Darnell's voice saying \"Damn I'm truly sorry about what happened to Brandi. I hope baby lands on her feet, but they better make damn sure they fix that dent in her heart before they let her out\". ==Cast== * Martin Lawrence as Darnell Wright/Narrator * Lynn Whitfield as Brandi Webb * Regina King as Mia Williams * Bobby Brown as Tee * Della Reese as Mama Wright * Malinda Williams as Erica Wright * Daryl Mitchell as Earl * Roger E.
