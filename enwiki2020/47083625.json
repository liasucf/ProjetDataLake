Kuwait's Emir arrived at the location of the incident after a short period of time.H.H The Emir arrives the incident's location \u2013 Arabic Kuwaiti al-Watan newspaper \u2013 26 June 2015 Twenty-seven people were killed and 227 people were wounded. Twenty-nine suspects were taken to court and after approximately ten sessions, most of them public, 15 were found guilty, with 7 to receive capital punishment (5 in absentia). Those include Adel Eidan, who drove the bomber to the mosque and admitted his intention to bomb the mosque and claimed that he wanted the mosque itself to be bombed, but \"not the people\", and Mohammed and Majid az-Zahrani (in absentia), who delivered the explosives to the terrorists in Kuwait and were arrested by Saudi authorities. Three other Islamist attacks took place on the same day in France, Tunisia, and Somalia. The attacks followed an audio message released three days earlier by ISIS senior leader, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, encouraging militants everywhere to attack the stated enemies of ISIS during the month of Ramadan. No definitive link between the attacks has yet been established. One attack, at a French factory, resulted in the beheading of one person; another, at a Tunisian beach resort, killed 38, most of them British tourists; and the other, an attack on an African Union base undertaken by Al-Shabaab, killed at least 70. == Background == The only prior bombing attacks in Kuwait took place in 1983 and 1985, which caused at least five fatalities - the perpetrators themselves. Sectarian tensions have been generally low in Kuwait. The Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Kuwait, located in the Sawabir district in Sharq area, which is a part of the Capital Governorate. The mosque is attended mainly by Shia Muslim worshippers. This attack was a part of the strategic terrorism of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which considers Shia Islam to be heresy. In late May 2015, after the Qatif and Dammam mosque bombings, ISIL released a voice message calling on Muslims to clear the Arabian Peninsula of its Shia population. == Bomb explosion == A suicide bomber attacked the mosque during Friday prayers in Muslim holy month of Ramadan, factors that made the mosque more crowded than usual. At least eight people were immediately killed in the blast, which heavily damaged parts of the building. A witness said that the bomber entered the last row between the worshipers and detonated his device. Another witness, Parliament member Khalil al-Salih, who was in the mosque during the attack, said the same. He added \"The explosion was really hard. The ceiling and wall got destroyed\". He added that more than 2,000 people were praying there at that time. === Victims === Twenty-seven people were killed, consisting of 18 Kuwaitis, three Iranians, two Indians, one Saudi, one Pakistani and one Bedoon. Another 227 people were wounded in the attack, of whom 40 were still hospitalized on 28 June. Eight of the deceased victims were sent to Peace Valley cemetery, in the Shia holy city of Najaf, Iraq, by an official state plane. === Responsibility and investigation === The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant identified the bomber as Abu Suleiman al- Muwahhid, and said in a statement posted on social media that he had targeted a \"temple of the rejectionists\" \u2013 a derogative term used towards Shias. By the following day, Kuwaiti authorities had arrested several people in connection with the attacks, including the driver of the car that took the bomber to the mosque, and the owner of the house he stayed in, which initial investigations showed that he is a supporter of \"extremist and deviant ideology\". The Ministry of Interior released a statement on its website two days after, identifying the perpetrator as Fahd Suleiman al-Qabba (born 1992), a Saudi citizen. The statement added that the terrorist arrived in the country on a commercial flight on the day of the attack. In his Instagram account, the arrested owner of the car, posted pictures of him giving lessons to kids in a mosque in the Sulaibiya area. His account was suspended in accordance with Instagram terms. According to local newspapers, the perpetrators were told 20 days before to commit an operation that will \"Shake Kuwait up\", and let them choose the time and location. After picking the location, they contacted ISIL leaders about their plans via WhatsApp and e-mail, and checked the mosque for a two-week period. The source says that the explosives arrived at terrorist's house by partners from Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, the driver stopped at the parking lot of the mosque, along with suicide bomber at 11:00 am. Both of them waited until the mosque got crowded with worshipers. The suspected suicide bomber then went out holding a device, and when he opened his hand the bomb exploded. CCTV clip indicates that the suicide bomber walked into the mosque with his left hand crossed at his stomach. After the crime, the perpetrators were planning to escape Kuwait, but the rapid response of the Ministry of the Interior left them with no time to do so. The day of the attacks has been dubbed \"Bloody Friday\" by international media. Two weeks later, Saudi authorities said that they had arrested three brothers suspected to be involved in the attack. On 14 July, the public prosecutor charged twenty-nine people involved in the attack - including the two Saudi brothers \\- and one still at large. The public prosecutor demanded the death penalty for eleven suspects. === Trial === ==== Criminal Court ==== Most sessions were public. Eleven suspects were released after the 6 August session, and the trial was deferred to the 10 August to assign new lawyers to those suspects without legal representatives. After the trial, the lawyer of the 9th and 11th suspects stepped down from defending the ninth suspect, as his testimony contradicted that of the eleventh. The lawyer of the 26th suspect also stepped down for \"private reasons\". The first suspect's lawyer also stepped down claiming the same reason. The first suspect's, Adel Eidan, the man who drove the bomber to the mosque and brought the explosives from the Saudi brothers near the Kuwaiti-Saudi border and gave shelter to the bomber after he arrived from Saudi Arabia, made the claim that he wanted to bomb the mosque without killing anyone. On the 15 August session, a lawyer was fined 100 KWD (~$330) for not showing up without an excuse, and another attorney was assigned for his clients. On the same session, one of the suspect's claim that he was tortured was refuted by the Forensic Medicine doctors. All session were public except the fourth session, and the suspects were able to see and contact their lawyers. Some females suspects were charged with hiding and destroying important evidence. For example, the twentieth suspect destroyed Fahd al- Qabba's (the bomber's) mobile phone. On 14 September 2015, the court ruled that 15 out of the 29 suspects had been found guilty, with seven receiving death sentences (five in absentia). === Appeals and Cassation Court === The Appeals court reduced the sentence of ISIS leader in Kuwait Fahad Muharib to 15 years in prison, and upheld Eidan's sentence. With this, Eidan is the only defendant in Kuwait to receive the death penalty. The cases of the five other defendants sentenced in absentia were not brought before the higher courts as their charges can only be challenged when they appear. The Cassation Court upheld all of the Appeals Court's sentences. == Aftermath == The Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Sabah was on the scene minutes after the attack, as was the speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament, who called for an urgent meeting.\u0648\u0642\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642 \u0628\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u064a\u062a \u2013 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u064a \u2013 26 \u064a\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0648 2015 The cabinet convened an emergency session later in the afternoon. Several pictures were posted in social media and local newspapers showing men smeared with blood outside the mosque, a row of victims wrapped in white body bags, and the damage the mosque received. Calls for blood donations have been made. After receiving sufficient blood, the rest of the donors were told to come back after iftar \u2013 the meal eaten after sunset that marks the end of fasting. According to a Blood Bank supervisor, the bank received 1300 donors by the end of first day. The wounded were sent to more than five hospitals across the country.Imam as-Sadiq explosions \u2013 Alaan Online Newspaper Several private hospitals announced that they will treat any victim of the incident for free.Private Hospitals open their doors for free to receive the wounded in the terrorist incident \u2013 Al-Watan Daily Kuwaiti Arabic online newspaper \u2013 26 June 2015 Stuttgart Hospital in Germany announced that they will treat the victims for free.
