There is a rather inwardly oblique narrow streak of dark fuscous suffusion from the tornus reaching more than halfway across the wing, and a spot of dark fuscous suffusion on the costa beyond this. A slender dark fuscous streak runs along the termen. The hindwings are grey, thinly scaled and subhyaline (almost glass like) anteriorly, with the veins, apical area and termen suffused with dark fuscous.Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. 22 (1): 163. ==References== Category:Hypatima Category:Moths described in 1913 ",
