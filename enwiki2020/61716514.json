    "text": "Numberphile is an educational YouTube channel featuring videos that explore topics from a variety of fields of mathematics. In the early days of the channel, each video focused on a specific number, but the channel has since expanded its scope, featuring videos on more advanced mathematical concepts such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Riemann hypothesis. The videos are produced by Brady Haran, a former BBC video journalist and creator of Periodic Videos, Sixty Symbols, and several other YouTube channels. Videos on the channel feature several university professors, math communicators, and famous mathematicians. In 2018, Haran released a spin-off audio podcast titled The Numberphile Podcast. ==YouTube channel== The Numberphile YouTube channel was started on September 15, 2011. Most videos consist of Haran interviewing an expert on a number, mathematical theorem, or other mathematical concept. The expert usually draws out their explanation on a large piece of brown paper and attempts to make the concepts understandable to the average, non-mathematician viewer. It is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) and Math for America.Numberphile sponsors Mathematical Sciences Research InstituteNumberphile Nominated in Education 8th Annual Shorty Awards Haran also runs the \"Numberphile2\" channel, which includes extra footage and further detail than the main channel. The channel was nominated for a Shorty Award in Education in 2016.The 8th Annual Shorty Award Alexis Joy, January 19, 2016 The New York Times has said, \"At Numberphile, mathematicians discourse, enthusiastically and winningly, on numbers\".Genres Stretch, for Better and Worse, as YouTube Takes On TV By Mike Hale, New York Times, April 24, 2012 ===Contributors=== The channel has featured a wide array of mathematicians, computer scientists, scientists, and science writers, including:Guest speakers on Numberphile MSRI * Federico Ardila * Alex Bellos * Elwyn Berlekamp * Andrew Booker * Timothy Browning * Brian Butterworth * John Conway * Ed Copeland * Tom Crawford * Zsuzsanna Dancso * Persi Diaconis * Rob Eastaway * Laurence Eaves * David Eisenbud * Edward Frenkel * Hannah Fry * Lisa Goldberg * James Grime * Ron Graham * Edmund Harriss *Gordon Hamilton * Tim Harford * Don Knuth * Holly Krieger * James Maynard * Barry Mazur * Steve Mould * Colm Mulcahy * Tony Padilla * Simon Pampena * Matt Parker * Roger Penrose * Ken Ribet * Tom Scott * Henry Segerman * Carlo H.
