    "text": "The Connecticut College Black Womanhood Conference was a three-day conference to celebrate the roles of black women in numerous professional spheres, including education, medicine, fine arts, and politics. It is thought to be the first conference of its kind to occur on an American college campus. == History == The Class of 1931 had the first black student to enroll and graduate from Connecticut College, followed by another student in the Class of 1949 who did not graduate. During the 1950s, six black students were present at the College, but the classes of 1959 to 1967 were made up of only white students. However, in 1968, ten black students enrolled in the College. This change prompted administrative efforts to further recruit underrepresented groups into the college. In the same year, the first Afro-American Society at Connecticut College was founded, simultaneous to the admission of men into the previously all-women's college. After a year of planning, the Black Womanhood Conference was set to take place on April 18\u201320, 1969 with the aid of Sue Johnson, executive coordinator, and Dr. Mabel Smythe, Advisory Board and Board of Trustees member. Student leader Beverly Phillips described the purpose of the conference in the following statement: \"Being Black, we feel that the Black contribution to America has been slighted. Being Black women, we have tried to bring distinguished Black women of many fields to this campus, to talk about what it is to be Black in this society and to discuss the Black experience as it relates to their individual professions.\" Students of Connecticut College gather in the student center, Crozier-Williams, for the first Black Womanhood Conference. == Conference == === Keynote address === Vinie Burrows, star of the one-woman, Off-Broadway production Walk Together, Children, performed a speech that integrated excerpts from Black American literature in order to convey the experiences of black women, asserting that \"black womanhood is singularly featured in the works of black poets and writers.\" === Seminars === Seminars led by prominent black woman figures representing a wide range of professional interests took place in the dormitory common rooms. Guest speakers included Jewel Plummer Cobb, a professor of biology at Sarah Lawrence College, cancer researcher, and upcoming Dean of the College at Connecticut College;\"Guest Speakers at Black Womanhood Conference.\" Conference on Black Womanhood, Folder 1.

Inspired by the work of Gwendolyn Brooks, Norton explored how the nuanced experiences of black women and their families distinguish them from white women and families; this difference can enable the establishment of egalitarian ideals within black family structures and the professional world.Norton's Closing Address.

This was a significant accomplishment given the conference's historical proximity to the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the majority of white women on Connecticut College's campus.Thomson, Margaret L. \"Black Womanhood Conference at Connecticut College April 18, 19, and 20, 1969.\" Letter to Editors and News Directors. 20 Mar. 1969.
