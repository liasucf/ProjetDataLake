    "text": "Pomponius Porphyrion (or Porphyrio) was a Latin grammarian and commentator on Horace. ==Biography== He was possibly a native of Africa, and flourished during the 2nd century A.D. (according to some, much later). ==Works== His scholia on Horace, which are still extant, mainly consist of rhetorical and grammatical explanations. We probably do not possess the original work, which must have suffered from alterations and interpolations at the hands of the copyists of the Middle Ages, but on the whole the scholia form a valuable aid to the student of Horace. ==Editions== *Acronis et Porphyrionis commentarii in Q.
