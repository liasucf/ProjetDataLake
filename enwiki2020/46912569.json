Based in Port Huron, Michigan, the Prowlers play their home games at the McMorran Arena. ==History== The Federal Hockey League (FHL) held a regular season game at McMorran Arena on January 31, 2015 between the Danbury Whalers and the Danville Dashers. 1,709 fans saw the Dashers defeat the Whalers by a score of 4-1, leading the FHL to strongly consider Port Huron as a market and seek out ownership for a franchise there. Two months later, on April 2, it was announced that the FHL's newest franchise would be based in Port Huron, making it the tenth hockey team to call Port Huron and the McMorran Arena home and the FHL's first Michigan team. Barry Soskin of Arlington Heights, Illinois, who also owned the Danville Dashers and Dayton Demonz FHL teams, serves as the team's owner. A name-the-team contest was held, with the Prowlers name, logo and colors being announced on June 5. On July 16, the Prowlers announced that the protected player list from the Dayton Demonz had been transferred to their team when Soskin folded his Dayton team. The Prowlers won their first FHL championship in their 2015\u201316 inaugural season, sweeping the Danbury Titans 3-0 in a best-of-five series concluding on April 22, 2016 at McMorran Arena. On January 7, 2017, the Prowlers surprisingly fired inaugural head coach Trevor Karasiewicz after leading the team a 8\u201310\u20131\u20135 record in 2016\u201317 and to the championship the previous season. He was replaced by Joe Pace, Sr. as the interim head coach. Pace Sr. stayed on as head coach the for the 2017\u201318 season. He led the team to a regular season title and a berth in the Commissioner's Cup Finals where they lost to the Watertown Wolves. The following 2018\u201319 season, Pace Sr. was hired as the head coach of the Mentor Ice Breakers FHL expansion team. He was replaced as head coach and general manager of the Prowlers by his son, Joe Pace, Jr. who had previously been a Prowlers' player, assistant coach, and assistant general manager. In 2018, the FHL began calling itself the Federal Prospects Hockey League (FPHL) and fully rebranded before the 2019\u201320 season. ==Season-by-season records== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
