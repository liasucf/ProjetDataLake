    "text": "San Benedetto da Norcia, painted by Scilla. Agostino Scilla (10 August 1629 \u2013 31 May 1700) was an Italian Baroque painter, paleontologist, geologist, numismatist, and a pioneer in the study of fossils and in scientific illustration. He is known for his paintings and also in the history of paleontology for the book La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (\"Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense\", 1670) which was introduced to English audiences by William Wotton of the Royal Society in 1696. He was among the first to promote a scientific understanding of fossils in contrast to fantastic Biblical and divine interpretations. ==Life== The son of a notary in Messina, Sicily, Scilla studied under Antonio Barbalunga in Messina and Andrea Sacchi in Rome and became a painter. His frescos in Messina were painted for the church of San Domenico, and in the Nunziata de' Teatini, and many paintings including one of San Ilarione dying painted for the church of S. Ursula. His frescos in the Cathedral of Syracuse date from 1657. After participating in an unsuccessful revolt against Spanish rule, in 1678 he was exiled from Sicily. Scilla worked as a painter in Turin and then Rome for the rest of his life. He was a censor in the Academy of Design in Rome in 1695.Il centesimo dell'anno 1695 celebrato in Roma dall'Accademia del Disegno, by Giuseppe Ghezzi, page 5. One of his pupils was the painter Antonio Madiona. ==Works== 223x223px Scilla began to study fossils found in the hills of Sicily, sometimes accompanied by botanist Paolo Boccone. His only written scientific work is La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (\"Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense\", 1670).Agostino Scilla, La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso, ed. by Marco Segala, Florence: Giunti, 1996. Original edition available on archive.org. The book was dedicated to the Sicilian nobleman Don Carlo di Gregorio, who founded the Accademia della Fucina (1639\u20131678) in Messina. In this work Scilla argues for a scientific explanation for fossils, as opposed to them being of fantastic origin or a test of faith from God. He also correctly identified the supposedly magical objects that were called glossopetrae, or \"tongue stones\", as the teeth of sharks. He was however not the first to do this. Nicolas Steno had made a similar claim about three years earlier but it is not known if Scilla had seen that work. Fabio Colonna in Dissertatio de glossopetris (1616) had burnt these fossils to show that they were made of lime, organic matter, rather than minerals. The book included 29 drawings of fossils drawn from specimens by him and engraved using copper-plate by Pietro Santi Bartoli. The book was rediscovered by William Wotton of the Royal Society in 1696 and an English summary became widely available. Scilla was apologetic about being but an untrained artist and the style of writing was commented on by Wotton as lacking art. Scilla argued that his training gave him a painter\u2019s eye with the ability to probe into nature and interpret things better, and depict nature without mediation. Shark teeth and glossopetrae drawn by Scilla Scilla argued that fossils were not lusus naturae, whimsical simulacra of animals and plants created by God or divine Nature. He termed fossils as \"jokes of time, not of nature.\" Athanasius Kircher had claimed that inanimate nature could produce pictures and sculptures that resembled living things. Girolamo Cardano claimed in his On the Subtlety of Things (1550) that he owned a piece agate that had the face of the Roman emperor Galba in it. Scilla dismissed Cardano's claim. Scilla may have seen fossil collections in Rome belonging to Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679) and his secretary Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588\u20131657). Scilla had also been influenced by Giovan Pietro Bellori (1613\u20131696) who had lectured on the role of the artist in inquiry. Bellori besought artists to go deep into a subject just as they examined the squaring of the circle and explored anatomy below the skin of the nudes they depicted, as depicted in Carlo Maratta's Tanto che basti (1682). Maratta had been a student of Sacchi alongside Scilla. Scilla gained reputation as a scientific illustrator and worked for Marcello Malpighi. Scilla is considered to have been the first to use dotted lines to indicate reconstructions in paleontological illustration. John Ray made use of some of Scilla's fossil illustrations. Scilla's fossil collection was acquired by John Woodward (1665-1728), an English physician, in 1717. These went into the University of Cambridge and became the nucleus of the collections of the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Dorsum Scilla on the Moon is named after him.Romano, Marco, Historical Biology (2013): \u2018The vain speculation disillusioned by the sense\u2019: the Italian painter Agostino Scilla (1629\u20131700) called \u2018The Discoloured\u2019, and the correct interpretation of fossils as \u2018lithified organisms\u2019 that once lived in the sea, Historical Biology: An International Journal of Paleobiology, DOI: 10.1080/08912963.2013.825257 == See also == List of Italian painters ==References== ==External links== *La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (1670) - digital facsimile from the Linda Hall Library * Scan from the Biodiversity Heritage Library on the Internet Archive Category:1629 births Category:1700 deaths Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Sicilian painters ",
