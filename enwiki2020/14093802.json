At the 2011 Census the population of the parish was 2,327. ==2007 Local Election== Brinsley elected Sadie Graham, a British National Party candidate in the 2007 Broxtowe council elections.. However, she sat as an independent until she was dismissed for failing to attend meetings. ==Brinsley Headstocks== Brinsley used to be a major mining village. The only remainder of this heritage are the headstocks. They are not only of significance for the area but are also the only headstocks left of this kind. After the final closure of Brinsley Pit they had been moved to a museum but have recently been restored and brought back to near their original place. The Friends of Brinsley Headstocks have worked on turning the area into a nature reserve. There are several farms in the area that have gone organic. The countryside is often explored by leisure walkers with walks organised by D.H. Lawrence Heritage. ==Brinsley Carnival== Originated in the early 1900s as a hospital parade, where local farmers and growers would dress their carts, and sell produce to raise money to send the sick and injured in Brinsley to hospital. The Carnival evolved into a family day out, fete or gala over many years, with enforced gaps over the two world wars. It was restarted in 1960 by George Mills of Broad Lane in Brinsley, the local postmaster, and has continued to this day. Brinsley Carnival is traditionally held on Fathers day, at the recreation ground in Brinsley. It is organised by a group of volunteers who raise money at the carnival and throughout the year to finance the following years carnival and give away money to local good causes. For over 50 years Brinsley Carnivalhttp://www.brinsleycarnival.com has offered a day's entertainment for families from the village and surrounding areas. But it has also given thousands of pounds to local causes. It is an event organised by the community, for the community. For some local organisations it provides their annual opportunity to raise awareness about their activities and to provide a welcome boost to their funds. The recipients of donations from Carnival proceeds are all either Brinsley based, or offer their services and membership to Brinsley residents. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Nottinghamshire Category:Places in the Borough of Broxtowe Category:Civil parishes in Nottinghamshire ",
