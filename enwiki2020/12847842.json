    "text": "Timothy Judge (born July 8, 1964 in Miami, Florida U.S.) is a former American \"Old School\" professional Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1979-1985. When he was a young racer his given name was used in the diminutive \"Timmy\". His nickname was \"Da Judge\" a play on an on the 1970s catch phrase \"Here come da judge\" first popularized on the 1968-1973 comedy Variety show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. The show was off the air for about six years when Tim Judge first came to national BMX attention, but due to the show's popularity and his name lending itself to be associated the pharase \"Here comes Da Judge\" was quickly associated with him. He was greatly renowned for his pioneering jumping ability and his innovative jumps including reputedly being the first to do a \"One Footer.\" It is jump in which you launch your bicycle to a high altitude then take on foot off a pedal; the further off the better with three feet or so being the most spectacular. Then before landing quickly place your foot back on the pedal. That jump in turn lead to the one foot \"Table Top\" a jump in which while in the air you lay the frame of your parallel with the ground like a standard \"Table Top\" but in addition you remove the foot closes to the ground from the pedal while doing so. You then quickly bring your bicycle back up right and your foot placed back on the pedal before landing.
