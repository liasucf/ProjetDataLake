    "text": ":See also: World fish production, Fishing industry by country, and Types of seafood Global total wild fish capture and aquaculture production in million tonnes, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization This is a list of aquatic animals that are harvested commercially in the greatest amounts, listed in order of tonnage per year (2012) by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Species listed here have an annual tonnage in excess of 1,600,000 tonnes. This table includes mainly fish, but also listed are crabs, shrimp, squid, bivalves, and a soft shell turtle. Note that Oreochromis niloticus and Penaeus monodon appear twice, because substantial amounts are harvested from the wild as well as being extensively raised through aquaculture. ==Summary== The 70 wild species shown in this table total 41,925,250 tonnes. Other wild species total 49,410,980 for a world total of 91,336,230 tonnes of wild, captured animals. The 31 cultivated species shown in this table total 45,252,999 tonnes. Other cultivated species total 21,380,254 tonnes for a world total of 66,633,253 tonnes of animals cultivated through aquaculture. ==Harvested aquatic animals by weight== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Common name(s) !Binomial name !Image !Wild/ cultivated !Harvest in tonnes !Notes |- | Grass carp | Ctenopharyngodon idella | 120px | Cultivated | 5,028,661 | China is the major producer of the grass carp. One reason this species is preferred in aquaculture is that it grows quickly and requires fairly little dietary protein. Low-cost feed such as grain processing and vegetable oil extraction by-products, terrestrial grass, and aquatic weeds, allows the grass carp to be produced cheaply. This fish is mainly sold fresh, either in pieces or whole. |- | Peruvian anchoveta | Engraulis ringens | 120px | Wild | 4,692,855 | |- | Silver carp | Hypophthalmichthys molitrix | 120px | Cultivated | 4,189,578 | A variety of Asian carp, widely cultivated with other aquaculture carp, but under pressure in its home range (China and eastern Siberia). Also called \"flying fish\", it is an invasive species in many countries. |- | Common carp | Cyprinus carpio | 120px | Cultivated | 3,791,913 | |- | Asari, Japanese littleneck, Manila clam, Filipino Venus, Japanese cockle, Japanese carpet shell | Venerupis philippinarum | 120px | Cultivated | 3,785,311 | |- | Alaska pollock | Theragra chalcogramma | 120px | Wild | 3,271,426 | 120pxThis species is often the main ingredient in crab sticks. |- | Nile tilapia | Oreochromis niloticus | 120px | Cultivated | 3,197,330 | |- | Whiteleg shrimp | Penaeus vannamei | 120px | Cultivated | 3,178,721 | |- | Bighead carp | Hypophthalmichthys nobilis | 120px | Cultivated | 2,898,816 | |- | Skipjack tuna | Katsuwonus pelamis | 120px | Wild | 2,795,339 | |- | Catla | Catla catla | 120px | Cultivated | 2,761,022 | |- | Crucian carp | Carassius carassius | 120px | Cultivated | 2,451,845 | |- | Atlantic salmon | Salmo salar | 120px | Cultivated | 2,066,561 | The wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially dead; after extensive habitat damage and overfishing, wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are farmed, predominantly from aquaculture in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia. |- | Atlantic herring | Clupea harengus | 120px | Wild | 1,849,969 | 120px |- | Chub mackerel | Scomber japonicus | 120px | Wild | 1,581,314 | 120px |- | Rohu | Labeo rohita | 120px | Cultivated | 1,555,546 | |- | Yellowfin tuna | Thunnus albacares | 120px | Wild | 1,352,204 | |- | Japanese anchovy | Engraulis japonicus | 120px | Wild | 1,296,383 | |- | Largehead hairtail | Trichiurus lepturus | 120px | Wild | 1,235,373 | |- | Atlantic cod | Gadus morhua | 120px | Wild | 1,114,382 | |- | European pilchard | Sardina pilchardus | 120px | Wild | 1,019,392 | |- | Capelin | Mallotus villosus | 120px | Wild | 1,006,533 | |- | Jumbo flying squid | Dosidicus gigas | 120px | Wild | 950,630 | |- | Milkfish | Chanos chanos | 120px | Cultivated | 943,259 | |- | Atlantic mackerel | Scomber scombrus | 120px | Wild | 910,697 | 120px |- | Rainbow trout | Oncorhynchus mykiss | 120px | Cultivated | 855,982 | |- | Giant tiger prawn Asian tiger shrimp | Penaeus monodon | 120px | Cultivated | 855,055 | |- | Araucanian herring | Clupea bentincki | | Wild | 848,466 | 120px |- | Chinese razor clam Agemaki clam | Sinonovacula constricta | | Cultivated | 720,466 | |- | Chinese mitten crab | Eriocheir sinensis | 120px | Cultivated | 714,392 | |- | Wuchang bream | Megalobrama amblycephala | | Cultivated | 705,821 | |- | Pacific oyster Japanese oyster Miyagi oyster | Crassostrea gigas | 120px | Cultivated | 608,688 | |- | Louisiana crawfish Red swamp crawfish | Procambarus clarkii | 120px | Cultivated | 598,289 | |- | Akiami paste shrimp | Acetes japonicus | | Wild | 588,761 | One of 14 species in the genus Acetes, this small, krill-like prawn is used to produce shrimp paste in South East Asia. |- | Gulf menhaden | Brevoortia patronus | 120px | Wild | 578,693 | 120px |- | Indian oil sardine | Sardinella longiceps | 120px | Wild | 560,145 | |- | Black carp | Mylopharyngodon piceus | 120px | Cultivated | 495,074 | |- | European anchovy | Engraulis encrasicolus | 120px | Wild | 489,297 | |- | Northern snakehead | Channa argus | 120px | Cultivated | 480,854 | |- | Pacific cod | Gadus macrocephalus | 120px | Wild | 474,047 | |- | Pacific saury | Cololabis saira | 120px | Wild | 460,961 | |- | Pacific herring | Clupea pallasii | 120px | Wild | 451,457 | 120px |- | Bigeye tuna | Thunnus obesus | 120px | Wild | 450,546 | |- | Chilean jack mackerel | Trachurus murphyi | 120px | Wild | 447,060 | 120px |- | Yellow croaker | Larimichthys polyactis | 120px | Wild | 437,613 | |- | Haddock | Melanogrammus aeglefinus | 120px | Wild | 430,917 | |- | Gazami crab | Portunus trituberculatus | 120px | Wild | 429,959 | |- | Amur catfish Japanese common catfish | Silurus asotus | 120px | Cultivated | 413,350 | |- | European sprat | Sprattus sprattus | 120px | Wild | 408,509 | 120px |- | Pink salmon | Oncorhynchus gorbuscha | 120px | Wild | 406,131 | |- | Mrigal carp | Cirrhinus mrigala | | Cultivated | 396,476 | |- | Channel catfish | Ictalurus punctatus | 120px | Cultivated | 394,179 | See also: Aquaculture of catfish |- | Blood cockle | Anadara granosa | 120px | Cultivated | 391,574 | |- | Blue whiting | Micromesistius poutassou | 120px | Wild | 378,794 | |- | Hilsa shad | Tenualosa ilisha | 120px | Wild | 376,734 | |- | Daggertooth pike conger | Muraenesox cinereus | 120px | Wild | 372,704 | |- | California pilchard | Sardinops caeruleus | 120px | Wild | 364,386 | |- | Cape horse mackerel | Trachurus capensis | 120px | Wild | 356,795 | |- | Pacific anchoveta | Cetengraulis mysticetus | | Wild | 352,945 | |- | Japanese flying squid | Todarodes pacificus | 120px | Wild | 351,229 | |- | Argentine shortfin squid | Illex argentinus | | Wild | 340,622 | |- | Pollock | Pollachius virens | 120px | Wild | 336,838 | 120px |- | Chinese softshell turtle | Pelodiscus sinensis | 120px | Cultivated | 335,535 | This species is a significant part of China's aquaculture.
