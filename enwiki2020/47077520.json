From 1927 onwards, he was dogmatics professor at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. (achev\u00e9 d'impr., 1932)-1938 quoted in the BNF catalogue quoted in the BNF catalogue As a specialist in Jean Calvin, he authored several books and articles on Reformed dogmatics. thumb == Early life == Auguste Lecerf was born in London on September 18, 1872, to communards anti- clerical and agnostic parents who had sought refuge in England at the end of the Paris Commune in 1871.Calvin and His Influence, 1509-2009, Philip Benedict Pg, 242 At the age of 12, He was religiously awakened in an Evangelical Sunday School in London. Later he converted to Protestantism at age 17 after reading Romans and Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. He was then baptized at 17.The History and Character of Calvinism By J.T. McNeill Page 430 ==Influence== One of the first traces of reformational scholarship [in France] can be found in the writings of Auguste Lecerf. The third chapter of his famous Introduction \u00e0 la dogmatique r\u00e9form\u00e9e (Lecerf, 1938) deals with \"Calvinism and philosophy\". There the reader may be surprised to discover that long before Dooyeweerd lectured in France, Lecerf (1938: 41) mentions \"les philosophes r\u00e9form\u00e9s Dooyeweerd et Vollenhoven\" and shows familiarity with their ideas. Even more surprising is the fact that he discussed the two reformational philosophers before 1938, in a series of scattered articles which were published posthumous with the title Calvinist studies (Lecerf, 1949). Those studies were the object of intense dialogue with the famous French philosopher \u00c9tienne Gilson (1884-1978) who argued with Lecerf from a Roman Catholic point of view, in his Christianity and philosophy (Gilson, 1936). With this, reformational thinking was brought to the attention of the \"top level\" philosophers of France.Renato Coletto, Traces of neo-Calvinism in France and Italy. Koers, 75(1):149-172: He was a major influence on two other key French Reformed theologians Pierre-Charles Marcel and Pierre Courthial. It was Lecerf who encouraged Pierre Marcel to study Herman Dooyeweerd.Thomas Reid (2002) 'The heritage of Auguste Lecerf' Evangelical Times (March) In France and French-speaking Switzerland, Auguste Lecerf's teaching and writing succeed in creating a whole new Calvinist movement within Protestantism. With his friend pastor Jacques Pannier, Auguste Lecerf launched the Calvinistic Society of France and he was the first editor of its Bulletin.Bernard Reymond, Le protestantisme et Calvin: que faire d'un a\u00efeul si encombrant ? Publisher: Labor et Fides, 2008, 134 pages, , p. 107 He studied at the Faculty of Protestant Theology in Paris. His thesis was on determinism and responsibility in Calvin's system. He was involved in pastoral ministry for almost twenty years in Normandy and for four years was a military chaplain. In 1932 he returned to Paris to become a professor in the Protestant Faculty of Theology, University of Paris. He remained there until his death in 1943. Lecerf was strongly influenced by Jonathan Edwards.Auguste Lecerf, Le determinisme de la responsabilite dans le systeme de Calvin (Paris: Imprmerie Jouve, 1894. The introduction to this work indicates his debt to Edwards He studied under Auguste Sabatier but turned away from that teacher's vague spirituality to write a thesis of his own on entitled: Determinism and Responsibility in Calvin's System, (1895). His subsequent theological work is much influenced by Herman Bavinck and Dutch Neo-Calvinism.Kevin Davis, A Guide to Reformed Systematic Theology Texts (blog) Among his most influential followers are: * French pastor Pierre-Charles Marcel (1910\u20131992) who launched in 1950 La Revue R\u00e9form\u00e9e * French pastor Pierre Courthial (1914\u20132009), leader of the evangelical wing of the Reformed churches in France, from the evangelical theology seminar of Aix-en-Provence * Andr\u00e9 Schlemmer (1890-1973), a French medical doctor with a strong Reformed church involvement, author of several books among which a collection of Auguste Lecerf's writingsAuguste Lecerf, Etudes calvinistes, recueillies et annot\u00e9es par Andr\u00e9 Schlemmer, Delachaux et Niestl\u00e9, Neuch\u00e2tel et Paris, 1949, 148 pages, recension par Emile G.
