The 1908 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All- Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1908 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season. ==Consensus eleven== The eleven selected by a majority of selectors included: *Vaughn Blake, end for Vanderbilt. One of the prominent Vanderbilt Blake family, he was later an FBI agent involved in the capture of Alvin Karpis. *C. C. Countess, center for Alabama. The school's first All-Southern player. *J. R. Davis, tackle for Georgia Tech; Davis was known as \"Twenty percent\" because he was considered twenty percent of the team's worth. Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin wrote, \"He has one glaring fault--a tendency to tackle around the eyebrows. Otherwise he is a splendid foot ball man. He weighs two hundred pounds, is never hurt, never fumbles, bucks a line hard and furnishes excellent interference. He was the strength and stay of Tech.\" *Frank Faulkinberry, tackle for Sewanee, later a coach at Middle Tennessee State. *Lewie Hardage, halfback for Auburn, had his breakout season in his first year. Fuzzy Woodruff labeled him the South's \"fastest back of the 1910-1920 decade\". *James L. Harris, guard for Sewanee. also played tackle and running back. *Louis Hasslock, tackle for Vanderbilt. Before Vanderbilt played Michigan, Hasslock had been on duty at Reelfoot Lake with a militia who were to guard against night riders. When he learned he could be granted a leave of absence if he were to join his football team, he walked a distance of twenty miles through a country infested with night riders, and caught a train at Union City. *Walker Leach, halfback for Tennessee. McGugin noted \"All things considered, Leach was perhaps the best football player of the year in Dixie.\" *Lawrence Markley, fullback and captain for Sewanee. McGugin wrote of Markley, \"He has always been a very stubborn man on the defense, effective on a short plunge, and his cool head has helped to steady his team through many a crisis.\" *Ray Morrison, quarterback for Vanderbilt, was the best player on a team of sophomores. *Walker Reynolds, end for Auburn, was the first cousin of Walker Reynolds Tichenor. ==All-Southerns of 1908== ===Ends=== *Vaughn Blake\u2020, Vanderbilt (C, H-1, DM, NB, EW, VA) *Walker Reynolds, Auburn (C, GR-2) *Silas Williams, Sewanee (H-1, DM) *Del Pratt, Alabama (EW) *Carlton Elliott, Virginia (VA) *Stricker Coles, Clemson (H-2) *Chip Robert, Georgia Tech (H-2) *C.
