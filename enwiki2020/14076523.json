    "text": "After the 1960 census, Maryland was apportioned an eighth representative, an increase of one over its 1950-1960 apportionment. From 1963 to 1967, the state kept the seven districts it had used since 1953 and used an at-large representative. After 1967, however, eight districts were drawn and the at- large district was eliminated. Democrat Carlton R. Sickles was the sole at- large representative. == List of member representing the district == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"height:3em\" ! Member ! Party ! Years !
