    "text": "Advertisement, 1916. Mary Pickford (1892\u20131979) was a Canadian-American motion picture actress, producer, and writer. During the silent film era she became one of the first great celebrities of the cinema and a popular icon known to the public as \"America's Sweetheart\".Sources: * \"Calling Mary 'America's Sweetheart' was not exactly a stroke of genius. I was simply putting down in two words what everyone in America seemed to be thinking about her.\" \u2014 B.P. Schulberg, publicist for Famous Players and scenario writer for In the Bishop's Carriage (1913) and Tess of the Storm Country (1914) * (Cover of Scott Eyman's biography) Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting on stage in 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, she moved to the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, followed by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract that made her a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956. Pickford won two Academy Awards in her lifetime. The first was in 1929 when she won the award for Best Actress for her performance in Coquette. The second was in 1975 when she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award \"in recognition of her unique contributions to the film industry and the development of film as an artistic medium\". As of 2009 two of Pickford's films have been added to the National Film Registry: Tess of the Storm Country (1914) and The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917).Sources: * * For her work in motion pictures Pickford received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6280 Hollywood Boulevard. Unless otherwise referenced, the information presented here is derived from the web site of the American Film Institute, the filmography prepared by Library of Congress historian Christel Schmidt, and the books Mary Pickford Rediscovered by Kevin Brownlow, Mary Pickford: From Here to Hollywood by Scott Eyman, and Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood by Eileen Whitfield. == Short films == === Biograph (1909) === Mary Pickford began working for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in April 1909 and remained with the company until the end of 1910. During this period Pickford made 43 films released in 1909, plus a 44th film that was not released. Most of these films are one-reelers while the remaining films are split-reelers (i.e. one of two films released on the same reel). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\" ! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Release date ! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Credited as ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Director ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes |- ! width=\"6%\" | Writer ! width=\"6%\" | Producer ! width=\"6%\" | Actress ! width=\"15%\" | Role |- | May 24, 1909 | scope=\"row\"| Two Memories | | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Marion's sister | D.W.

After Secrets, her final film as an actress, she continued working as a producer, including two films in collaboration with Jesse L. Lasky. In 1945, she and her third husband, Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, co-founded Comet Productions to produce \"B\" pictures for United Artists. Her role as producer in these later films was generally uncredited. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\" ! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Release date ! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Credited as ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Director ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes |- ! width=\"6%\" | Writer ! width=\"6%\" | Producer ! width=\"6%\" |Actress ! width=\"15%\" | Role |- | March 30, 1929 | scope=\"row\"| Coquette | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Norma Besant | Sam Taylor | A Mary Pickford Production Released by United Artists Academy Award for Best Actress |- | October 26, 1929 | scope=\"row\"| The Taming of the Shrew | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Katherine | Sam Taylor | A Mary Pickford and Elton Corporation Production Released by United Artists |- | Not released (filmed in 1930) | scope=\"row\"| Forever Yours | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Mary Carlton / Mary Marlow | Marshall Neilan | A Mary Pickford Production Not completed; 3\u00bd minutes survive |- | March 14, 1931 | scope=\"row\"| Kiki | | align=center bgcolor=| | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Kiki | Sam Taylor | An Art Cinema Production Released by United Artists |- | March 16, 1933 | scope=\"row\"| Secrets | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | Mary Carlton / Mary Marlow | Frank Borzage | A Mary Pickford Production Released by United Artists |- | May 13, 1936 | scope=\"row\"| One Rainy Afternoon | | align=center bgcolor=#90ff90| Yes | | | Rowland V.

Pickford historian Christel Schmidt has confirmed that the actress does not appear in these films. The Internet Movie Database lists Pickford as appearing in the Biograph shorts entitled Mrs. Jones Entertains (January 9, 1909), The Fascinating Mrs. Francis (January 21, 1909) and The Deception (March 22, 1909). However, Pickford did not begin with Biograph until the end of April 1909. Mary Pickford is credited with appearing in the movie Pictureland in 1911 but a recently discovered copy shows that she is not in the film. The stars are Isabel Rae and King Baggot and the film was likely directed by Thomas Ince. ==See also== Timeline of Mary Pickford == Footnotes == == References == ; Main sources * * (Originally titled Mary Pickford \u2013 America's Sweetheart) * * * Petersen, Anne Helen (2014).
