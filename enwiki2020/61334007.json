On the topic of the leak, Del Rey told NME magazine how discouraging it was, adding how \"even songs I\u2019ve never emailed to myself [were accessed]. There are hundreds of them...\" and in response to them being from her early career, she added that \"some of them were, but some of them, like \u2018Black Beauty\u2019, weren't...\". ;Unreleased/leaked * \"Fine China\" \u2014 Leaked on Christmas Day 2016. * \"Yes to Heaven\" \u2014 Leaked on Christmas Day 2016. * \"Angels Forever, Forever Angels\" \u2014 Leaked in 2013, the track was posted online alongside other Rick Nowels collaborations including \"JFK\", \"Hollywood\", and \"Black Beauty\". The track's similarities to \"Black Beauty\" have caused speculators to assume it to have been originally intended for Ultraviolence, further theories claiming the song was excluded after Dan Auerbach reworked the record's sounds and cut some of the contributions from the Nowels sessions. * \"Your Girl\" \u2014 Snippets leaked in August 2016 while a rough, full-length version of the song leaked in 2017. ;Released/repurposed * \"Wait For Life\" \u2014 Originally recorded for Del Rey's second studio album, the track was eventually used on producer Emile Haynie's debut album, We Fall (2015). * \"I Can Fly\" \u2014 Possibly meant to be originally for Ultraviolence, this track was eventually used in the film Big Eyes (2014), as producers found Del Rey's theme-of-the-same-name for the film to be too sad to end the film as the song in the credits. * \"Black Beauty\" \u2014 It was leaked in 2013, but Del Rey evidently decided to still include it as a bonus track on her album, Ultraviolence (2014). ===Lust for Life (2015-17)=== * \"Serene Queen\" \u2014 The track was written by Del Rey and produced by Rick Nowels and was the first song recorded for \"Lust For Life\" but was ultimately scrapped. * \"The Next Best American Record\" \u2014 Recorded in early 2016, a demo leaked in early 2017 under the name \"Architecture\". The song is sometimes alternatively referred to as \"Best American Record\". Del Rey said that the track and fellow Lust for Life outtake \"Yosemite\", were like \"Yin-Yang\" to one another. She later mentioned during a promotional tour for the record that she would like to release the two songs as standalone folk singles at some point. The song was later used on Del Rey's follow-up record, Norman Fucking Rockwell, in 2019. * \"Yosemite\" \u2014 In anticipation for her fifth studio album, Del Rey teased the track \"Yosemite\" in interviews as well as on her social media. * \"Something Real\" \u2014 The track was written by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, being later reworked into what would become the song \"13 Beaches\". * \"Roses Bloom For You\" \u2014 It was recorded in early 2017 and produced by Rick Nowels. On June 3, 2017, Del Rey shared a video on her Instagram profile of herself recording the song in the studio with Nowels. * \"Wild One\" \u2014 The song was co-written by Del Rey and Justin Parker. === Norman Fucking Rockwell (2018-19)=== * \"Hey Blue Baby\" \u2014 An outtake from Del Rey's 2019 record, the track was debuted by Del Rey and the record's producer, Jack Antonoff, at his Ally Coalition event in New York. * \"I Must Be Stupid for Feeling So Happy\" \u2014 An outtake from Del Rey's 2019 record, the track was debuted by Del Rey and the record's producer, Jack Antonoff, at his Ally Coalition event in New York. ==References== Unreleased songs Lana Del Rey ",
