She married on 20 November 1509 in Wolfenb\u00fcttel Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg (1470\u20131543). Her father summoned the Parliament in 1509 to collect a lady tax, because he found himself unable to pay the dowry alone. Only after long negotiations, did the Parliament grant three rounds of real estate tax, to generate for money for a dowry and jewels for the princess. Catherine was a strict Catholic with close ties to her relative in Brunswick kin. This induced Gustav I of Sweden, to marry her daughter, in an attempt to the Catholic German princes from supporting of King Christian II of Denmark.Ivo Asmus, Heiko Droste, Jens E.
