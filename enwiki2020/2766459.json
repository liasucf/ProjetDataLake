    "text": "Bukit Brown MRT station is a future underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the Circle line (CCL), located in Novena planning area, Singapore. The station is situated in the former Bukit Brown Cemetery and got its name from the cemetery, named after George Henry Brown, the first owner of the land, and was used as a Chinese burial ground between 1922 and 1973. Announced along with the 17 stations of CCL Stages 4 and 5 in November 2005, it was designated as a future station to be opened in the future. This station is currently non-operational due to the lack of development and demand in the area, although there are structural provisions set for the station future construction. Jalan Mashhor serves the station facilities on the ground level. ==History== When the Circle Line Stages 4 & 5 were announced in November 2005, Bukit Brown was one of the three 'shell' stations of the line set to be constructed in the future when there are sufficient demands in the area. Structural provisions were made during the construction of the CCL to facilitate the easier construction of the future station. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== * Category:Toa Payoh Category:Proposed railway stations in Singapore Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations ",
