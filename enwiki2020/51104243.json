Akanksha's long hair was cut as a short pixie cut. She wept after being forced to having the haircut. Also, Pranati's long black hair was cut as a auburn lob with bangs. After makeover, the models have a cover shoot for a Livon Serum product and they also have to decide which one out of three photos should be used for the packaging. And that will be the photo the judges assess at deliberation. At judging, Lisa Haydon tells them disappointingly that they have chosen photos that accentuate their own strengths, instead of sell the product for the client. But with Neelam, this smart and ambitious girl puts a smile on Lisa\u2019s face by scoring best photo two weeks in a row and even the client calls her picture \"fabulous\". Priya has once again ended up in bottom two with Minash, whose mature look and average photo only manage to yield a lukewarm response from the judges. Faced with a tough decision, Lisa eventually gives Priya one more chance to translate her passion for modelling into her photoshoots. *Challenge winner/Immune: Pranati Prakash *First call-out: Neelam Virwani *Bottom two: Ashmita Jaggi and Priya Banerjee *Eliminated: Ashmita Jaggi *Guest judge: Manish Malhotra ===Episode 4=== Original airdate: *Wildcard Entry: Ritija Malvankar *First call-out: Neelam Virwani *Bottom two: Minash Ravuthar and Priya Banerjee *Eliminated: Minash Ravuthar *Guest judge: Hardee Shah ===Episode 5=== Original airdate: *Challenge winner: Rajashree Singha and Poulomi Das *First call-out: Rajashree Singha *Bottom two: Pranati Prakash and Ritija Malvankar *Eliminated: Ritija Malvankar *Special guest: Ricky Singh *Featured photographer: Nuno Oliveira and Ashish Chawla *Guest judge: Upen Patel ===Episode 6=== Original airdate: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
