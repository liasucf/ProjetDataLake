    "text": "Super Turrican is the fifth video game in the Turrican series for the SNES released in 1993. Super Turrican was also released on the Virtual Console in Europe and Australia on February 29, 2008, and in North America on March 3, 2008. ==Description== Super Turrican was developed by Factor 5 and published by Seika. It plays similarly to Mega Turrican (also developed by Factor 5) and shares a similar visual style. The game has a different set of levels, however, and features a freeze beam in place of the original lightning whip. The game only features 4 worlds and ends with the H. R. Giger-inspired alien boss, despite a representation of 'The Machine', similar to that featured in Mega Turrican, appearing in the prologue. ==Super Turrican: Director's Cut== A previously unreleased uncut version of the game, titled Super Turrican: Director's Cut, was included with the Analogue Super Nt console. Previously, this uncut version was considered for release on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, but was rejected by Nintendo due to not being previously released on consoles. ==See also== *Super Turrican (NES) *Super Turrican 2 ==References== ==External links== * Super Turrican at MobyGames Category:1993 video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Virtual Console games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Seika Corporation games Category:Run and gun games Category:Turrican Category:Video games scored by Chris Huelsbeck Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Side- scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games set in the 31st century ",
