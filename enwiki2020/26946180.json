    "text": "Norfolk County in the Canadian province of Ontario consists of a long list of communities. Its four designated population centres are Simcoe, Port Dover, Delhi, and Waterford. Map of Norfolk County from 1877, showing historical townships. The population of the County at the time of the 2016 Census was 64,044. Of that number, 13,922 live in the community of Simcoe. In the late 1900s, the county was merged with Haldimand County but the merged entity was dissolved in 2000 and this area became The Town of the County of Norfolk. ==Communities== ===A\u2013M=== ====Andy's Corners==== Andy's Corners () is a small community that is between Wyecombe and Carholme in Norfolk County. Agriculture is the dominant industry and commerce consists of a variety store and a place to buy Volvo automobiles to the east of the hamlet. Most of the clients who buy automobiles from the local Volvo dealership are tobacco farmers and their families. Only Pepsi soft drinks are served at the general store and the population is less than 30 people. The nearest town with a shopping mall is Tillsonburg about 15\u201330 minutes to the northwest. Delhi is to the northeast. High school children here go to Valley Heights Secondary School while elementary school students go to Langton Public School. The town's only intersection offers a facilitated way to get to Lynedoch, Silver Hill, Pinegrove, and Delhi. ====Atherton==== Atherton () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Gilbertville and Simcoe. The population of Atherton is less than 100 people and there are no sidewalks in the hamlet. The tiny community can be found by exploring on Highway 3 as well as Lynedoch Road which is the other major road that goes into Atherton. The manufacturing plant is located north of Walsh, northeast of Pine Grove, and southeast of Delhi. The hamlet is a farming community with little or no commerce in the area. ====Bill's Corners==== Bill's Corners () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is between Green's Corners and Hillcrest. Further to the east is the town of Simcoe, which is the closest town to Bill's Corners. The sole industry in the hamlet is agriculture; abortive attempts were made to have a garage for automobile repair during the 1990s and early 2000s. The hamlet has a population of fewer than 200 people. Walsh Public School provides education for grades JK-8, and Simcoe Composite School provides secondary education. Bill's Corners was one of the last communities in Norfolk County to receive broadband access. A group of local citizens tried to fight this service but failed when Norfolk County council allowed the infrastructure to be installed in Bill's Corners anyway. As of 2014, nobody has petitioned Norfolk County council to remove broadband Internet service from Bill's Corners. One famous previous resident was Dwayne Roloson, who played for six different teams before retiring from the National Hockey League. Roloson currently serves as a goaltending consultant within the Anaheim Ducks organization for the Norfolk Admirals (Norfolk, Virginia). ====Blayney==== Blayney is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Pine Grove and Green's Corners. Established prior to 1920, it is considered to be one of Norfolk County's lost hamlets. It once hosted its own post office and general store before they were burnt down sometime after 1920. There is no commerce and the cultivation of tobacco is the main industry. The hamlet is formed on the crossroads of Yuell Road and Regional Road 1 (known locally as McDowell Road). On Yuell Road South, there is a house that is almost completely underground. To the northwest is Delhi and to the southeast is Walsh. The nearest gas station is in Pine Grove. Groceries, toiletries, and clothing are purchased from either Simcoe, Delhi, or Tillsonburg. Stores located near Blayney are Wal-Mart, Giant Tiger, Food Basics, Real Canadian Superstore and Sobeys. Rick Danko, a musician and founding member of The Band, has a historical plaque dedicated to him near his childhood home. He performed on a 4-string tenor banjo shortly after entering grade 1. As a child, Danko was hyperactive, but was diagnosed in an era before Ritalin became mainstream. Antidepressants were given to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from the late 1940s to the late 1950s because psychostimulant drug weren't handed out to hyperactive children until the early 1960s. ====Bloomsburg==== Bloomsburg () is a hamlet in Norfolk County which can be found on the old Ontario provincial Highway 24 that turns off from the \"new\" Ontario Provincial Highway 24 just 1.5 miles (CONVERT) north of Simcoe. Bloomsburg is the home of Bloomsburg Public School which is exclusively for primary and junior students (kindergarten through sixth grade). There is no commerce in this hamlet and the only industry is agriculture. ====Booth's Harbour==== Booth's Harbour is a community in Norfolk County. There is a historic harbor present which is named after a man named Booth who was one of the earliest settlers in the area. The village was founded in the 19th century.

The town has many small businesses including a convenience store, a mechanics shop, a hairdressing parlour, a cut-your-own Christmas tree lot, and a cabinetry shop. ====Clear Creek==== Clear Creek () is a hamlet in southwestern Norfolk County. Although people live there and own real estate, the hamlet is legally described as agriculture land, not residential land to reduce property taxes. Approximately 70 people live in this town amongst the 140 houses. About 9 of the houses have been abandoned due to safety issues from the wind turbines.Consequences of building the wind turbines at Wind Turbine Syndrome.com People have lived in this community as far back as 1901 with some Canadian soldiers from the First World War having been raised in this community.Community information at ePodunk There are no sidewalks for safer pedestrian walking and wind turbines are seen very frequently within the vicinity of Clear Creek; being installed in November 2008.Clear Creek Wind Farm at Canadian Wind Energy Association Norfolk County has banned the placement of new wind turbines after becoming a \"willing host\" for them back in 2003. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming \"industrialized\" and \"unnatural.\" Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the county as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century. The nearest high school is Valley Heights Secondary School which is to the northeast. Students from here grab the same high school bus as the students from Houghton. ====Courtland==== Former St George Greek Catholic Church Courtland () is a village located in Norfolk County on Highway 3 between Delhi and Tillsonburg. This community was once known as Middleton; named after the more well-known community of Middleton in Nova Scotia. The first settler was Lot Tisdale who arrived in 1823. 917 people live here as of 2009.History information at Rural Routes A 30-hectare certified organic herb farm owned by Garry Proven operates in the area.Comfort Food at ProQuest By the year 2020, Courtland will experience cable television and Internet speeds that are roughly comparable to Delhi's Internet speeds thanks to an underground cable system that will hook up communities like Langton, Port Rowan, and St. Williams into the world of reliable broadband Internet.High- speed Internet coming to Courtland at Simcoe Reformer To the west of the town is a motorcycle shop and a gas station that was once owned by UPI Energy. North Street is the oldest street in the village which runs parallel with the railroad tracks. There are five churches in the village, the oldest being the Lutheran Church. Main Street is the street that has the most commerce and Highway Crescent offers a passageway from the highway for the local residents. In the eastern part of the village, a cul-de-sac community called Talbot Court is being constructed. Sidewalks only exist on the main streets. Otherwise, the walk through Courtland is simple provided that pedestrians pay extra caution to the traffic on the street. Flat terrain exists throughout the entire village; and the village spans approximately 5 kilometres. Recommended activities are hiking, running, and walking. The usage of ATVs, motorcycles, and bicycles are not recommended due to safety concerns. Unlike most communities in Norfolk County, Courtland is entirely accessible for wheelchair users.Courtland Urban Trail informatiion at Ontario Trails The full extent of the service industry in Courtland includes a variety store, an antique store, a \"bread and pastries\" type of bakery which has been operating in the community since 1939,Courtland Bakery celebrates 75 years at Simcoe Reformer a family restaurant and a flower shop. Courtland Vinyl Windows and Gopher Dunes are a couple of well-known businesses in the area. A golf course was once located here; it closed on October 16, 2003, due to factors caused by the early 2000s recession. Official tax policy changes made after the 2003 Ontario provincial election worsened the local poverty rate and made people less likely to enjoy golf as a recreational sport. There are also two schools in Courtland; one being a public school and other being a part of the Catholic school system. ====Delhi==== Delhi (pronounced DEL-High) is located off of the junction of Hwy 59 and 3 and is known as the Heart of Tobacco Country. The settlement was founded by Frederick Sovereign (or Sovereign) who built a cabin here in about 1812. At the time, the area was heavily treed and would become important in the lumber industry. The village was named Sovereign's Corners (or Sovereign's Corners) and later Fredericksburg until the post office opened as Delhi in 1856. Sovereign was a tavern keeper for over 30 years. He also manufactured plug tobacco, growing his own leaves, curing them, and pressing them. He donated the land for the Baptist church and served as deacon for \"many, many years\". The population in 1869 was 300 and the village had some manufacturing as well as a lumber mill thanks to the abundant water power. The post office was receiving mail daily. The railway arrived in the 1870s a definite benefit to locals who opened business such as the Delhi Canning Company, established in 1878; the company shipped canned local produce across Canada.http://delhimuseum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Walking-Tour-Early- Settlement.pdf The village initially had a log schoolhouse but a new school was built in 1892. By around 1900, the village had an opera house, two tanneries, a railroad station, an Orange Hall and a Mechanics' Institute as well as a flour mill, the Quance Mills or Sovereign-Quance Mills.http://www.ruralroutes.com/5765.html At the time, the primary crops in the area were still fruit and vegetables. Until 2001, Delhi was located within the Township of Delhi, a municipal government within the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk. Prior to the amalgamation of Norfolk County, the population of the former Township of Delhi was 16,365 in the Canada 2001 Census Part of the agricultural heritage of Delhi included tobacco cultivation. The town has a tobacco museum to commemorate this part of its history. Local farms rely in part upon Jamaican and Mexican workers, who usually arrive around mid-to-late April and return to their homelands around early-to-mid November. North Creek was once the most important spawning point for the local fish species until it was dammed in 1965. Local fishermen in addition to avid enthusiasts from the region historically fished near the now highly regulated tributaries during the 1940s and 1950s. Today, Big Creek is the main attraction for fishers of all ages. As of 2016, the majority of Delhi's residents speak English as a first language and were born in Canada. Females outnumber males, and working-age people outnumber children and elderly people. Delhi will experience a surge in old age pensioners by the year 2026. Seventy people were born in the United States of America, while 250 were born in Europe. Ten residents were born in Africa, while 20 residents were born in Asia.Further information about the population structure (2016) at City Population Delhi's population is expected to grow to approximately 5,215 residents by 2056, although future wars and pandemics may affect this population growth. People are less likely to have children or emigrate to Canada if there are any major political/medical events happening in the world. ====Dog's Nest==== Dog's Nest is a community northeast of Port Dover along Highway 6. Have had the sign stolen 3 times and municipality at the time decided not to put the sign back up. There is now a committee not for profit \"DogsNest 1851\" formed April 2019 to bring back the sign. They sell t-shirts, hats and merch to raise funds. 100% volunteer driven and 100% proceeds go towards the sign and surrounding area needs. ====Fishers Glen==== Fishers Glen is a fishing community that is south of Simcoe and southwest of Port Ryerse. It is considered to be a part of Norfolk County. Fishers Glen is famous among locals for being one of the best fishing spots in Lake Erie during the summer months. ====Frogmore==== Frogmore () is a hamlet that is situated on the junction of Norfolk County Roads 45 and 28. It is located northwest of Valley Heights Secondary School. Agriculture is the predominant industry while commercial business ventures are non-existent. It is one of the westernmost communities in Norfolk County. This community has a sizeable population of German Mennonites and Mexican Mennonites. Only six wind turbines, carrying approximately 9 MW of electricity have been placed in the vicinity.Frogmore Wind Project at Canadian Wind Energy Association No more can be built in this area due to a county-wide ban on wind turbines passed in 2013. Even without the threat of wind turbines, this community is completely shielded from urban development threats due to its isolation from major communities like Simcoe, Delhi, and Tillsonburg. The popular tourist destination of Port Burwell is just a 30 minutes' drive to the southwest of this community. Another historic community, Sparta, along with the St. Thomas Raceway Park lies 45 minutes to the southwest from Frogmore. ====Gilbertville==== Gilbertville () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is located between Pine Grove and Delhi. The local economy is founded on agriculture, which produces potatoes, onions, and asparagus, among other vegetables. Commerce in Gilbertville includes a tractor shop and an auto repair shop. There is a conservation park to the west of the hamlet. For administrative purposes and municipal elections, Gilbertville is considered to be the southernmost community in the third ward of Norfolk County. The founding fathers of Gilbertville all had the last name Gilbert. The hamlet was founded in the 19th century as a hitching stop between Simcoe and Delhi, along with nearby Atherton to the east. During the early 20th century, a military base in Gilbertville was used to house soldiers from the Royal Canadian Army during the First and Second World Wars. It is assumed to be used for civilian purposes since the defunct military base is considered to be private property. Prior to the 21st century, sulphur water was present in Gilbertville, causing a swamp-like stench. The problem eventually disappeared around 2002 due to advances in irrigation technology becoming more affordable to the region. A small creek is found in this hamlet; providing photo opportunities for photographers who are interested in nature scenery. There are no plans for expansion of any kind in Gilbertville. The population has remained relatively the same for more than 50 years. Property taxes are low. Any children who reside in Gilbertville attend Delhi Public School for their elementary education. Secondary education is provided by Delhi District Secondary School for students in the secular system while Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe provides the secondary school education for students in the Roman Catholic education system. ====Glenshee==== Glenshee () is a hamlet that is located west of Pinegrove in Norfolk County. The hamlet is mostly agricultural and residential. In addition to farms, there is also a machine shop that serves the local residents. The population is under 20 people and the nearest commerce is in Tillsonburg and Delhi. Glenshee also has an abandoned cemetery that is also known as the Bigcraft Family Cemetery; because it originally held the tombstones for the relatives of the Bigcraft family in addition to close family friends and their in-laws. At least 7 individuals are known to be buried there.Bigcraft Family Cemetery at Find a Grave School children here attend [Delhi District Secondary School or Valley Heights Secondary School] for their high school needs and either Delhi Public School or Walsh Public School for their elementary/junior high school needs. To the southwest is the village of Silver Hill where the nearest car mechanic is based. Terrestrial television and satellite television (either through Bell Satellite TV or Shaw Direct) are the only ways to acquire television service because there is no cable television service in Glenshee. ====Green's Corners==== Green's Corners is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is located west of Simcoe, north of Walsh, southeast of Delhi, and east of Pine Grove. The population of Green's Corners is less than 50 people. In addition to residential property, there is also agriculture and some commerce. There is a bakery, a bed and breakfast, an automobile garage, and a Christmas tree store. This hamlet was also the hometown of the late musician, Rick Danko of The Band, who enjoyed a remarkable career on and off the stage. A serious crime was committed in this hamlet at approximately 2 am on March 15, 2007. Jack Cousins was beaten up and his wife Carolyn Cousins (n\u00e9e Wooley) was raped by a gang of masked thugs. Police were summoned on the scene complete with sniffer dogs. Talk around the local bakery blamed their son's criminal career with illegal drugs as the reason for this attack. They are a lower middle class couple with no money or valuables in the house. On March 20, 2007, the suspects were captured. They were from Brantford and all three suspects were young males. ====Halfway House Corners==== Halfway House Corners is a hamlet in Norfolk County. It is considered to be south of Simcoe and northwest of Port Dover. The Halfway House was an inn that sat on the southwest corner of the intersection. The name was given because it was located exactly half the distance between Port Dover and Simcoe. Ontario Highway 24 is the main road and commerce in this community includes a bait shop and a recording studio. ====Hillcrest==== Hillcrest () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Bill's Corners and the town of Simcoe. There is also a soccer field; which received a $15,000 stimulus package from the Simcoe Lions Club on April 7, 2013.Simcoe and District Youth Soccer Club Get a Financial Boost at Simcoe Reformer Adult amateur leagues typically do not use this field; with the exception of the Western Ontario Soccer League.Simcoe Thunder Soccer Schedule at Western Ontario Soccer League During the winter months (late November through early April), Hillcrest becomes a haven for snowmobile users. Religious needs for this community are provided either by the Simcoe United Church or the nearby Kingdom Hall for Jehovah's Witnesses (although non- members are welcome as pupils for weekly service). The hamlet and all land that is within to the south are considered to be prime land by local developers; they believe that land should be earmarked for the further expansion of Simcoe. Hillcrest may cease to exist as a separate community and become a \"neighborhood\" of Simcoe by the middle of the 21st century. With the recent growth in new housing activity, the area may need to overhaul its water and sewer systems to meet the needs of a rising and aging population of the next several decades. Lands not being used by tobacco farmers either get converted into prime commercial land, prime residential land or get their tobacco crops replaced with other products. A grand total of 991 new low- density houses will have to be built to accommodate the new people. The new buildings could be \"layered\" over top of the old buildings; turning houses into makeshift apartment buildings and small stores into multi-floor shopping plazas. Alternate plans may include absorbing Renton, Port Dover and/or Waterford. Municipal planners will have to take into consideration the needs of the Oakwood Cemetery to expand as the current aging population begins to die in massive numbers. ====Houghton==== Houghton is a former township in Norfolk County. Its township seat was Fairground, a small village today. It is located in the southwest of Norfolk, bordering on the former Norfolk townships of Middleton to the northeast, and North and South Walsingham to the east. Fairground is a small community in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada where the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show took place in the early 19th century. Until that event was moved to Simcoe, this was the spot where fairgoers attended the attractions and farmers displayed their best produce. The community of Fairground borders on the municipality of Bayham in Elgin County to the west, and its southern border is the Lake Erie shoreline, with no natural harbours. Rising gas prices and pervasive poverty amongst residents prevent many young Houghton residents from going to the Norfolk County Fair near downtown Simcoe; creating a need for a more local fair that lasted since 1853.Small rural fair lives on at The Simcoe Reformer The township was part of Norfolk Township in Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk from 1974 to 2000. Agriculture dominates as the main industry and there is an elementary school called Houghton Public School in Fairground that serves children from kindergarten through eighth grade. Many families in the region had made Houghton their home since the late 1840s. ====Jacksonburg==== Jacksonburg () ====Langton==== Sacred Heart Church Langton () is a small town located in Norfolk County; formerly known as Boughner's Corner. The town can be accessed by travelling to the intersection just slightly to the west of Courtland and turning south on Ontario provincial Highway 59 if coming from Delhi, south if coming from Tillsonburg or if travelling eastbound on Ontario Provincial Highway 3, and straight ahead if travelling southbound using Ontario provincial Highway 59. Langton once had two banks but the CIBC bank closed in May 2016 due to increased online banking activity and the changing Canadian economy; placing the future of offline banking in this community in definite jeopardy.Langton loses bank \u2013 and a piece of history at Simcoe Reformer Despite its small population, Langton was considered to be a banking hub for the tobacco farmers during the 20th century.BMO to close in Delhi, Langton at Tillsonburg News The Langton Baptist Churchyard is the local cemetery in the area. Having a significant amount of history to it, there are at least 600 individuals who are buried in the cemetery; including people with the last name Boughner because of its closeness to the community of Walsh. The oldest female buried at this cemetery is Rebecca Boughner (who died in 1863) while the oldest male buried in this cemetery is James N. Martin (who died in 1865).Langton Baptist Churchyard at Find a Grave There are at least 5 members of the Millennials generation (born between 1980 and 2005) who are buried at this cemetery.Millennials in Langton Baptist Cemetery Sidewalks exist only on the main street, otherwise, walking in this town is very simple. The entire town spans 5 kilometers in length. Langton enjoys scenery that is very rural and flat. Streets can be busy sometimes; especially during the weekdays. Possible activities include hiking, walking, running, and cycling.Langton Urban Trail at Ontario Trails They have been able to receive cable television service since approximately 2011. Since children of elementary school age who live in Andy's Corners attend Langton Public School or Sacred Heart School, Andy's Corners is considered to be a subdivision of Langton. Langton was home to the Langton Thunderbirds, a junior hockey team that played in the Southern Ontario Junior Hockey League. Langton has two schools: Langton Public School and Sacred Heart Catholic School. ====La Salette==== La Salette Historic Church La Salette is a hamlet that is north of Delhi in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada. La Salette is southwest of Brantford in nearby Brant County and northwest of Simcoe. Agriculture is the main industry and commerce is extremely limited. Most of the houses in La Salette are over 100 years old and the population of La Salette is less than 100 people. ====Long Point==== Long Point is a sand spit and medium-sized hamlet on the north shore of Lake Erie, part of Norfolk County. It is about long and is about a kilometre across at its widest point. Lake Erie lies to the south of Long Point, and the waters to the north side comprise Long Point Bay. The bay is subdivided into the Inner Bay and Outer Bay by a line that runs between Turkey Point to the north and Pottahawk Point to the south. Some of the towns along the bay's north shore include Port Rowan, Turkey Point and Port Dover. Long Point is north and across the lake from Erie, Pennsylvania. Settlers from Europe began arriving in this area in 1790. After the American Revolution, many Loyalists began to settle here but after 1796, land was given to anyone who was capable of developing it. The first lighthouse was built in 1830. The recently renovated Old Cut Lighthouse. In the 19th century, a powerful storm cut an opening through the middle of Long Point. A lighthouse was built alongside the channel, which was the first of several on the point. The opening became known as \"The Old Cut\". The cut has since closed along the lakeshore, but boaters continue to use the northern portion to access the bay, homes and cottages. During the mid-19th century, some of the local residents saw an opportunity to make easy money by \"blackbirding.\" Blackbirders erected fake lighthouses during times of low visibility. Ships trying to enter the old cut would run aground. When the crew abandoned ship the blackbirders would loot the ship of cargo and other valuables. With law enforcement based in London, Ontario, these blackbirders would store their loot on the many hiding spots that Long Point offered. Abigail Becker on several occasions in the 19th century waded into stormy waters to save crew members of boats that had run aground. Long Point has caused many shipwrecks, with many of wrecks are right off the tip of the point. More than 400 ships have sunk in an area called \"The Lake Erie Quadrangle\". Sport hunting was important after the Long Point Company purchased the Point in 1866 to facilitate this pursuit. Long Point Provincial Park was created in May 1921; by 1929, it was connected to the mainland by a new causeway. ====Lynedoch==== Lynedoch () is a hamlet in Norfolk County which was named after Baron Lynedoch who served under Wellington during the Napoleonic Wars. During the 19th century, this hamlet had a post office, a school, a tailor, blacksmith, taverns, hotels, and churches.Tales from Lynedoch at Simcoe Reformer A church has been restored in the area and is being used for outdoor weddings and private receptions.Cranberry Creek Gardens at Paul's Halls Dennis' Horseradish is produced a short distance east of the settlement.Ryder Farms Inc. information at Wholesome PickinsDennis Horseradish Inc at Norfolk Farms By 2021, Lynedoch will gain access to high-speed Internet.Internet connectivity to roll through rural Norfolk at Norfolk News The village consists of elderly people on old age pensions in addition to a marginal amount of young married couples who wish to become homeowners. There is also a community group which is non-profit and consists mostly of people who live in the Lynedoch area. It is located northwest of Pine Grove, southwest of Delhi, and west of Simcoe. ===N\u2013Z=== ====Nixon==== Nixon is a hamlet in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada that is almost exclusively residential. There is an airfield, some farms, and a single office building that is dedicated to an agriculture-related business in the hamlet where Nixon Public School used to be. Nixon is east of the town of Delhi, northwest of the town of Simcoe, and northeast of the hamlet of Pinegrove. Plans are currently underway for a microbrewery to open in the community; beers and wines that emulate those found in Belgium and the Netherlands will be manufactured here. Producing very little noise or steam pollution, the microbrewery will bolster the economy of Norfolk County. Trappist beers will be brewed on site for the purpose of getting the higher-class members of Norfolk County to spend money more locally.Microbrewery Coming to Nixon at The Simcoe Reformer The municipal government approved the rezoning of the surrounding land to \"light industrial\" for Norfolk County's third microbrewery to be possible according to the local by-laws.Third microbrewery coming to Norfolk County at Norfolk Farms This community is the westernmost community to receive water from the Lynn River; which flows directly into Lake Erie. Beers and wines produced in the Nixon microbrewery will use the Lynn River as a source of their water. ====Normandale==== Normandale () is a quaint fishing town in southwestern Norfolk County that is famous for its perch and black bass. This settlement was part of Charlotteville where Fort Norfolk was built in 1813 with accommodation for 300 troops. A large iron foundry, the Normandale Furnace and Ironworks was built here in 1817 and was expanded in 1822; it made farm implements, the well-known Van Norman stoves as well as kettles, pots, and pans but closed down in 1847 or 1850. Commerce is extremely limited now and agriculture plays a smaller role than in other parts of Norfolk County. Normandale has a historical cemetery located on Spooky Hollow Road which has at least 288 individuals buried there.Normandale Cemetery at Find a Grave ====Pinegrove==== Prior to the late 1970s, much of Pine Grove was agricultural land owned by the Adcock family. After the family patriarch died circa 1978, the land was distributed amongst his sons and the first housing boom in Pine Grove occurred. Three-quarters of present day Pine Grove were completed by the mid 1980s. In the 1980s, children needing special education attended Nixon Public School and North Public School. Both of these schools are defunct and are no longer operating as of 2007. Starting in 1991, they could attend Walsh Public School under their special education program. Sidewalks were never built in order to attract people to this hamlet with low property taxes. No further construction was done in Pine Grove until circa 2002. While the weak Canadian dollar and low interest rates brought in 3 new single-family homes to the recently formed cul-de-sac of Woodland Drive, expansion has been slowed down by the rising interest rates and a strengthening Canadian dollar - construction of a fourth single-family home only started circa October 2007. A defunct Baptist church and cemetery can be found in Pine Grove. Although the original grave markers remain and can be publicly viewed, the former church building is now a private residence. Entering the residence without an invitation will result in criminal trespassing charges and prosecution. The defunct cemetery is located in between the gas station and the car repair shop. The grave markers are remarkably old and date back to the 19th century. Shortly after Norfolk County became a single tier municipality, the location of the cemetery was given the distinctive green Norfolk County sign for historical sites and parks. The gas station was once owned by a local couple and has serviced the area for decades. They briefly brought in a miniature video arcade to the convenience store part prior to 1982. However, it was removed when the locals found it to be too noisy. After the husband died in the mid 1990s, his widow operated the store until her death sometime prior to the year 2004. The gas station was eventually sold to a couple from Toronto who eventually sold it to someone else years later. In addition to gasoline and food, the convenience store also provides lottery tickets and offers a large selection of products within a small space. On June 4, 2007, a series of blackouts affected Pine Grove that was caused by a transformer that was on fire. The first one was from approximately 11:00 A.M. to 11:30 A.M which forced the Norfolk County Fire Department to arrive to the scene without having to close Regional Road 1. Even though the fire was extinguished and the transformer was patched, the patch was only temporary as the fire eventually resumed almost 7 hours later at approximately 7:00 P.M. This caused another blackout that lasted until approximately 11:00 P.M.. This blackout however did not affect Green's Corners, Hillcrest, or Simcoe. Ontario Hydro crews worked on replacing the transformer without the Ontario Provincial Police having to close down Regional Road 1. The total blackout period for the day was approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes (270 minutes). ====Port Dover==== In 1670, French missionaries Fran\u00e7ois Dollier de Casson and Ren\u00e9 Br\u00e9hant de Galin\u00e9e became the first Europeans to winter at what is now Port Dover. Earthen remains and a plaque marks the spot near the fork of the Lynn River (Patterson's Creek to many of the older Port Doverites) and Black Creek where they and seven Frenchmen (the first Europeans known to have ascended the Great Lakes to Sault Ste. Marie) built a hut and chapel. Just outside the community, a cross with the arms of France had been erected on 23 March 1670, claiming the area for King Louis XIV over the Lake Erie region. By 1794 the first settlers, a group of United Empire Loyalists, had established a hamlet known as Dover Mills (named for the English port of Dover) which was razed to the ground by the Americans in the War of 1812. During the war, in August 1812, Major General Isaac Brock gathered a force of about regulars and militia here. Using boats on the lake, they reached Amherstburg (also in Upper Canada) and then attacked and captured the American Hull's Army at Detroit. Subsequent reconstruction took place closer to the mouth of the Lynn River, where a harbour had been in use since the early 19th century. In 1835, merchant Israel Wood Powell registered a village plan for Port Dover. By 1842, the village was growing and had a population of almost 400. The harbor, lighthouse, and bridge across the river had been completed as had the road to Hamilton; there was a grammar school, a grist mill, a sawmill and a Presbyterian church in the course of construction.
