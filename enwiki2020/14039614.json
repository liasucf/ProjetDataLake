    "text": "Tatakoto is an atoll in the Tuamotu group in French Polynesia. Tatakoto is one of the more isolated atolls of the Tuamotus. It is situated in the east of the archipelago, from Tahiti. This atoll is long and wide. It has one large island and 65 islets separated by numerous channels on the reef surrounding the lagoon. The islands are mostly located on its windward side (south). All the islands are flat, not much higher than the ocean level. Its land area is about 7.3 km2, and the lagoon area is about 20 km2. The main settlement is Tumukuru, and the total population was 259 in the 2017 census.R\u00e9partition de la population en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise en 2017, Institut de la statistique de la Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise ==History== Tatakoto Atoll was sighted the same day by two Spaniards. In the second expedition of the \u00c1guila, the two captains, Domingo de Bonechea and Jos\u00e9 And\u00eda y Varela, separated when leaving Peru and did not see each other until reaching Tahiti. On 29 October 1774 (the day of Saint Narcissus) the two disembarked on Tatakoto without meeting. They named the island \"San Narciso\".Corney, Bolton Granvill The quest and occupation of Tahiti by emissaries of Spain during the years 1772-1776, London, 1913, Vol I, p.XLIII, XLVII Historically the island was also known as \"d'Augier\". Chronicler Jos\u00e9 And\u00eda described the atoll as \"extremely agreeable to the eyes by being very populated by shrubs.\" At the beginning of the twentieth century France established a colony and replanted the island with coconut palms, which still cover the island. Tatakoto Airport was inaugurated in 1979. ==Administration== Administratively Tatakoto Atoll has its own commune, which belongs to the \u00celes Tuamotu-Gambier administrative subdivision of French Polynesia.D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2005-1611 du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2005 pris pour l'application du statut d'autonomie de la Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise, L\u00e9gifrance == Transport == The atoll is served by the Tatakoto Airport . ==References== * *Tatakoto Airport (TKV) ==External links== *Presidency of French Polynesia site *Atoll list (in French) *Maps Category:Communes of French Polynesia Category:Atolls of the Tuamotus ",
