He became well-known because of his sculpture The Fallen Angel (El \u00c1ngel Ca\u00eddo, 1877), a work inspired by a passage from John Milton's Paradise Lost,Cat\u00e1logo de la Exposici\u00f3n Nacional de Bellas Artes (\"Catalogue of the National Fine Arts Exhibition\"), Madrid, 1878, p. 86-87. Mentioned by Carlos Reyero in book Escultura, museo y estado en la Espa\u00f1a del siglo XIX: historia, significado y cat\u00e1logo de la colecci\u00f3n nacional de escultura moderna, 1856-1906, Alicante, 2002, and which represents Lucifer falling from Heaven. The sculpture (see picture), of great dramatism and originality, obtained the First Medal at the Spanish National Fine Arts Exhibition in 1878, and the same year was cast in bronze for the third Paris World's Fair. Later on, the Prado Museum donated it to the City of Madrid, and in 1885 it was installed in a square with the same name in the Retiro Park (the largest one in Madrid). For that purpose, architect Francisco Jare\u00f1o (1818\u20131892) designed a pedestal of granite, bronze and stone. The success of this work made Bellver been accepted as academician. He was director of the Arts and Works School in Madrid. Other works of Bellver are in Saint Francis the Great Basilica, Saint Joseph Church, Pontifitial Church of Saint Michael, and Ministry of Public Works building in Madrid.
