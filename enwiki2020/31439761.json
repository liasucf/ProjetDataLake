    "text": "Lies and Lullabies is a Rod Hardy-directed 1993 ABC television movie about a pregnant cocaine addict, played by Susan Dey. The film was released on DVD as Sad Inheritance in 2005 and is also sometimes known as Love, Lies and Lullabies. ==Plot== Christina (Susan Dey) is the adult daughter of an alcoholic (Piper Laurie) and a habitual cocaine-user, who continues to abuse the drug after she becomes pregnant by her boyfriend (D.W. Moffett). In spite of disapproval from a well-meaning co-worker (Allyce Beasley), when the baby is born addicted, she is kept away from Christina based on the recommendation of a social worker (Lorraine Toussaint), who deems her an unfit mother. Distraught over being denied custody of her daughter, Christina begins the hard, uphill battle to find sobriety and regain her maternal rights. ==History== The script for Lies and Lullabies initially cast Dey as the sister of a closet-cocaine addict who dies during child birth. Dey's character was then charged with raising the baby, ignorant to the developmental delays that would follow. However, after visiting a treatment facility and meeting mothers who were in the process of seeking treatment to regain custody of their children, Dey (who also acted as the producer of the film), asked that the script be rewritten. \"(In the early stages) we all had very little compassion for these women. (But upon meeting them we learned) \"the reality is that these women can be helped and if given a chance for treatment and a choice between drugs and their children, many choose their children.\" ==Cast== * Susan Dey ...
