Clapham Rovers won 1\u20130, the only goal being scored by Clopton Lloyd-Jones.1880 FA Cup Final on Sporting Chronicle (archived, 14 Mar 2008) ==Overview== ===Weather=== At the start of the match, a strong and cold north-easterly wind blew into the faces of the Oxford team and the wind neutralised many of their kicks but it eased considerably after half- time.Final 1880 on FA-Cup Finals (archived, 11 Mar 2007) ===Scoring=== In the first half, Clopton Lloyd-Jones attempted to score twice, with a shot from the left which glanced off a goalpost, and a centre kick downfield which was saved by the Oxford goalkeeper Percival Parr. The ball hit the Oxford crossbar with a shot from Edward Ram and Harold Brougham shot just over the same bar. In the second half, six minutes before the close of time, the deadlock was broken when Francis Sparks conducted the ball to within \"about six yards of the University goal\". Although Oxford's Charles King attempted to stop the ball with a weak mis-kick, Lloyd-Jones, \"who had followed well up shot it between the posts. This feat quite 'brought down the house.'\" According to The Field magazine's report, there was \"vociferous cheering, throwing up of hats, and other demonstrations of delight from their supporters.\" At the game's end, Lloyd-Jones, and his team captain Robert Ogilvie, were specially cheered by the crowd. At 21 years and 150 days Lloyd-Jones was the 'baby' of his team and the youngest Cup Final scorer in the event's then history.Lloyd-Jones surpassed Charles Clerke (Old Etonians), who was 21 years 173 days at the 1879 Cup Final, and then surpassed in turn by Teddy Wynyard (Old Carthusians), who was aged 20 years 8 days at the 1881 Cup Final. ==Match details== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK || || Reginald Birkett |- |DF || ||Robert Ogilvie |- |DF || ||Edgar Field |- |MF || || Vincent Weston |- |MF || ||Norman Bailey |- |MF || ||Arthur J.

Wilde was known for a disdain of 'manly sports' (apart from occasional boxing at university). ==References== 1880 Category:1879\u201380 in English football Category:1880 in London Category:Oxford University A.F.C. matches Category:April 1880 sports events ",
