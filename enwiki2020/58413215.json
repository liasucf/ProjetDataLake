    "text": "Cavalry FC v FC Edmonton, referred to as the Al Classico or Battle of Alberta, is an inter-city soccer rivalry between Alberta-based clubs Cavalry FC and FC Edmonton. It is one of several sporting rivalries between the two large cities of the province. The Wildrose Cup is awarded annually to the team that wins the most points from the series in league play. ==History== The first edition of the Al Classico took place in 2018, when FC Edmonton's Academy played provincial rivals Calgary Foothills FC in two friendly games to help them prepare for their upcoming season. The fixtures were also used to gauge Edmonton's interest into a potential return to join the Canadian Premier League. In May and June respectively, it was announced that Cavalry FC, based in Calgary, and FC Edmonton would be joining the Canadian Premier League, where the rivalry would continue. In preparation for their inaugural Canadian Premier League seasons, Cavalry FC announced they would host a match between a Cavalry FC Prospects and FC Edmonton Prospects side on September 29, to be followed by a rematch on October 20 at Clarke Stadium in Edmonton. On September 11, 2019, Cavalry FC clinched the first-ever Wildrose Cup with a 1\u20130 win over FC Edmonton. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%\" |- !
