The rainforest covers about 220 hectares, between 1,450 and 1,640 meters elevation. The dominant canopy tree is Aningeria sp., with a smaller area (30ha) of tall Newtonia buchananii rainforest on the southeastern slope. Strangler figs (Ficus spp.) are abundant. Montane grasslands and shrublands are also found at higher elevations. Miombo woodland predominates on the lower slopes.
