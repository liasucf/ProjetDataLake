    "text": "thumb Pin Art or Pinscreen is an executive toy patented in 1987 by Ward Fleming.United States Patent 4,654,989 It consists of a boxed surface made of a crowded array of pins that are free to slide in and out independently in a screen to create a three-dimensional relief. Other similar product names are \"PinPressions\" and \"Pinhead\". Pinscreens were previously applied as animation in films. Pinscreen toys were once made of metal pins. Because the original metal pins were heavier and bent easily, newer Pinscreen toys are generally made of plastic pins.
