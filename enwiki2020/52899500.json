Her parents, Marion and James Williams, met in 1968 while using Project TACT, one of the first dating services established in the United States.

Within three years, she obtained a professional booking agent and began a performance career. An early performance was being an extra and singing on the soundtrack for the movie The Wiz, where she sang backup for Lena Horne. Moving to Los Angeles in 1992, she appeared in several independent films, including Skin and Bone. Notably, she co-starred in the independent cult classic America's Deadliest Home Video, which has a script upon which she collaborated with Jack Perez. The movie also stars Danny Bonaduce and Melora Walters, and is widely considered the grandfather of \"found footage\" movies, predating Man Bites Dog and The Blair Witch Project. Her performance in it has been described as \"brilliant.\" == Involvement with fetishism and kink == It was during her years in Los Angeles that Williams began her explorations of BDSM, subscribing to the newsletter published by the Society of Janus and exploring kink and fetish via the newly burgeoning world of online chat forums. She has been involved with the leather subculture and BDSM since 1996. She was named Ms. San Francisco Leather in 2009 and International Ms. Leather in 2010.
