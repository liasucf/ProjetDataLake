During the American Civil War (1861-1865) the group expanded its mission to caring for the sick. In 1868, they received a charter and organized a state grand lodge.Wright, George C. Life Behind a Veil: Blacks in Louisville, Kentucky, 1865--1930. LSU Press, 2004. p133 Taylor also became active in education and Freedmen's schools. Taylor In 1866, Taylor moved to Breckinridge County, Kentucky where he taught schools against the opposition by local whites. In 1868, Taylor was elected president of an educational convention in Owensboro, Kentucky. ===Religious career=== Taylor was involved in the Methodist Episcopal church, and that year he also was licensed to preach by Rev. Hanson Tolbert. In 1869, he was working as a teacher in Hardinsburg, Kentucky. The church then sent him to Arkansas as a missionary teacher. He preached in Texas, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) and Missouri before returning to Kentucky in 1871. In 1872 he was ordained by Bishop Levi Scott in Maysville, Kentucky and took charge of Coke Chapel in Louisville. In Louisville he created the paper, the Kentucky Methodist.

Press of Mississippi, 2002. ==Legacy of Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies== Taylor's Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies has been widely studied. In 1928, Newman Ivey White argued that the book was problematic because it did not distinguish black plantation hymns and white revival hymns. Later, George Pullen Jackson, who was an advocate of a later discredited theory that Negro spirituals have white origins, criticized the book for a lack of musicality in 1943, but used some of the scores from Taylor's collection as evidence for his theory. In 1979, Irene V. Jackson attempted to restore the significance of the collection in the eyes of historians with her work, and in 1988 Robin Hough added to collection, \"is as interesting for its political and religious agenda as it is for its musical content.\" The collection was widely influential at the time; noted revivalists Sol Tibbs and Fanny Tibbs sang from the collection and in 1901, Sol Tibbs republished a versions of Mama, Mama Make Cinda 'Haive Herself', which he took from the book. ==Personal life== In 1869, Taylor married Kate Heston, a teacher from Hardinsburg, Kentucky, where he lived at the time. Taylor died September 11, 1887 in Louisville Kentucky of a tumor on his throat.Smith, Gerald L., Karen Cotton McDaniel, and John A. Hardin, eds. The Kentucky African American Encyclopedia. University Press of Kentucky, 2015. p249 He had left his home in Indianapolis the day before and died at the home of his brother, George Taylor.
