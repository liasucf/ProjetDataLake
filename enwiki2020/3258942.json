    "text": "Qasar (also spelled Hasar or Khasar, and also known as Jo'chi Qasar; Mongolian: \u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440) was one of Genghis Khan's three full brothers. According to the Jami' al-Tawarikh, his given name was Jo'chi and he got the nickname Khasar after his distinguished bravery. He was also called Habutu Hasar (\u0425\u0430\u0432\u0442 \u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440, Hasar the Skillful (archer)) because he was skilled with a bow. ==Early life== Hasar, as a child, was thrown out of the Borjigin tribe along with the rest of the family by the Taichud warlord Targhutai Hiriltug. Food was scarce and Behter, his older half-brother, and the eldest of all the sons of the late Yesugei, stole or kept food from his mother and siblings. Hasar and his brother Tem\u00fcjin killed their half-brother Behter as he returned from a fresh hunt. After the defeat of Tem\u00fcjin at Khalakhaljid Sands (1203), Hasar was lost and hid himself, along with his sons and followers, in the forest. Tem\u00fcjin then gathered new adherents among the Mongols, tricked his rival Ong Khan with a fake message of surrender from his missing brother Hasar, and crushed the Keraites in late 1203. ==Military career== Granted territories by the khan, Genghis Khan's full brothers Qasar, Khajiun, and Temuge formed the Left Wing of the Mongol Empire in the eastern edge of Inner Mongolia, while Genghis Khan's three sons, Jochi, Chaghatai, and \u00d6gedei, made up the Right Wing in the western edge. The Right Wing saw a significant expansion to the west but the Left Wing did not have so much land to be conquered. Qasar did conquer what would later be known as Manchuria, Korea and territories that are presently controlled by Russia (north of Korea). Hasar's mother, Hoelun defended him against accusations of disloyalty stemming from Teb Tengri, a shaman. Stiffened by his mother Hoelun and wife B\u00f6rte, who saw Teb Tengri as threat to the dynastic succession, Genghis allowed Khasar and Tem\u00fcge to kill Teb Tengri in a wrestling match. Unlike the Right Wing where properties were equally divided, Tem\u00fcge was favored over Khasar and Khachiun in the Left Wing. Hasar's ulus (people and secondarily, territory) was significantly smaller than Tem\u00fcge's. His original territory was located to the west of the Khingan Mountains and was surrounded by the Ergune and Hailar rivers, and the K\u00fcl\u00fcn Mountain. After the conquest of China, Hasarid princes had at least two additional territories in Shandong and Jiangxi, respectively. == Ancestry == ==Descendants== The princely houses of Hasar, Hachiun, and Tem\u00fcge tended to coordinate with the five powerful clans: the Jalayir, Khunggirad, Ikires, Uruud, and Mangghud. They were usually led by princes from Tem\u00fcge's house. At Arigh Bukha's rebellion, the three princely houses supported Khubilai (Genghis Khan's grandson) under leadership of Tem\u00fcge's grandson, Ta'achar. Among Hasarid princes, the third family head Yes\u00fcngge is probably the most famous. He was a son of Hasar and succeeded his brother Yeg\u00fc. He is the hero of the Yes\u00fcngge Inscription (formerly known as the Genghis Stone). The princely house was succeeded by Yes\u00fcngge's son, Esen Em\u00fcgen, and then Em\u00fcgen's son, Shigd\u00fcr. Although Shigd\u00fcr joined the rebellion against Khubilai led by Tem\u00fcge's great- great-grandson Nayan, the princely house survived without confusion. The sixth head, Babusha, was given the title of Qi Wang by Khayishan K\u00fcl\u00fcg Khan in 1307. Sources show that Qasarid princes continued to hold the title even after the empire retreated from China. Hasar's descendants were effective in other parts of Mongol Empire. It is also claimed that one Qasarid prince was killed in order to protect the last Great Khan Toghogan-Temur from Ming troops. Togha Tem\u00fcr, a descendant of Hasar, was the last powerful claimant to the throne of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century. The family was known as the Hasar(Qasar) clan. With the death of Togha_Tem\u00fcr at the hands of the Sarbadars of northern Khurasan in the mid-1300s, it is possible that the surviving members of the Hasar(Qasar) clan escaped into the mountains of what is today Afghanistan, where their descendants maintained their clan name of Hasar, which evolved over time into Hasara or Hazaras. As the Hazara people do not have a written history of their own, nothing can be proven, but this theory is more likely versus the theory that the name Hazara comes from the Persian word for \"one thousand,\" which is actually, \"hezar( ).\" As these Il Khanate Mongols had converted to Shia Islam and married Farsi speaking Persian women, their children had been raised as Shia Muslims with a mixed Mongol-Persian characteristic. This explains the current culture of Hazaras people very well. It is not clear what happened to Hasarid princes from the late Yuan Dynasty to the middle 15th century because of the confusion caused by the Mongols' withdrawal from China. Mongolian chronicles compiled from the 17th century to the early 18th century contain some records on Hasar's descendants but they are considered mostly unhistorical by historians. In particular, Altan Tobchi by Mergen Gegeen (not to be confused with Lubsandanjin's Altan Tobchi) exaggerated the influence of Hasarid princes as the author himself descended from Khasar. The Oirat ruler Esen Tayisi deported a body of the Horchin to Western Mongolia in 1446 and they became the Khoshuds.C.P.Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.310 It is widely accepted that Hasar's descendant Bolunai was a historical figure since his existence is confirmed in contemporary Chinese sources of 1463, 1467, and 1470. Mongolian chronicles say that Bolunai's brother Unubold killed Muulihai of the Ongliud, a descendant of Genghis Khan's half brother Belg\u00fctei. Another famous story about Unubold tells that he proposed to Mandukhai Khatun, a widow of Manduulun Khan, but that she chose the Genghisid infant Batu M\u00f6ngke (Dayan Khan) over him. Bolunai led the Horchin Mongols. His descendants ruled the Horchin, Jalayid, Do'rbed, and Gorlos of the Jirim League, the Aru Khorchin of the Juu Uda League, and the D\u00f6rben He\u00fched, Muu Mingghan, and Urad of the Ulaanchab League in the Manchu Qing Dynasty's administration. Among them, Horchin princes established matrimonial relationship with the imperial family of Aisin Gioro at the early stage of the Manchu rise to power, and held top-ranking princely titles (ho\u0161oi cin wang) throughout the Qing Dynasty. The Dorbeds in Heilongjiang province submitted to the Qing in 1624, and they were organized into a banner in Jirim league ruled by descendants of Hasar. The Gorlos banners were also ruled by descendants of Hasar. == See also == *Mughal (tribe) == References == *Sugiyama Masaaki \u6749\u5c71\u6b63\u660e: Mongoru teikoku no genz\u014d \u30e2\u30f3\u30b4\u30eb\u5e1d\u56fd\u306e\u539f\u50cf, Mongoru teikoku to Daigen urusu \u30e2\u30f3\u30b4\u30eb\u5e1d\u56fd\u3068\u5927\u5143\u30a6\u30eb\u30b9 (The Mongol Empire and Dai-\u00f6n Ulus), pp. 28\u201361, 2004. *Sugiyama Masaaki \u6749\u5c71\u6b63\u660e: Babusha no reiji yori \u516b\u4e0d\u6c99\u306e\u4ee4\u65e8\u3088\u308a, Mongoru teikoku to Daigen urusu \u30e2\u30f3\u30b4\u30eb\u5e1d\u56fd\u3068\u5927\u5143\u30a6\u30eb\u30b9 (The Mongol Empire and Dai-\u00f6n Ulus), pp. 187\u2013240, 2004. *Okada, Hidehiro \u5ca1\u7530\u82f1\u5f18: The Descendants of J\u00f6chi Khasar in Altan Tobchi of Mergen Gegen \u58a8\u723e\u6839\u683c\u6839\u6240\u64b0\u300e\u9ec4\u91d1\u53f2\u7db1\u300f\u4e2d\u4e4b\u62d9\u8d64\u5408\u6492\u5152\u4e16\u7cfb, Ya-chou tsu-p'u hs\u00fceh-shu yen-t'ao-hui hui-i chi-lu \u4e9e\u6d32\u65cf\u8b5c\u5b78\u8853\u7814\u8a0e\u6703\u6703\u8b70\u8a18\u9304, No.6, pp. 45\u201357, 1993. *\u0427\u0443\u043b\u0443\u0443\u043d\u044b \u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439 - \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0442\u04af\u04af\u0445 1260 - 1388. \u0425\u0443\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0441 142.
