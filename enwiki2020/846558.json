    "text": "International Data Group, Inc. (IDG) is a Massachusetts registered and headquartered media, events and research company focused on the tech landscape. Founded in 1964 , it is made up of International Data Corporation (IDC) and IDG Communications; the latter includes CIO magazine, Computerworld,and spinoff Network World PCWorld, Macworld, InfoWorld, and JavaWorld. IDG was bought by China Oceanwide in 2017 while maintaining U.S. based leadership. ==History== International Data Corporation was founded in 1964 by Patrick Joseph McGovern, who sold his car to fund its startup. Based in Massachusetts, the company produced a computer installation data base (based on a customer list purloined from IBM), and published a newsletter, \"EDP Industry and Market Report\" (modeled on \"ADP Newsletter\", which was published by The Diebold Group). Companies such as RCA, Univac, Xerox, and Burroughs paid IDC for use of the data base. During this time, Mcgovern continued to work as a writer for \"Computers and Automation\" magazine, the first computer magazine, published by Edmund Berkeley. By its third year, the company had an income of $154,996. A modest net profit of $2,961. McGovern was considering liquidating the company when he hit on the idea of launching Computerworld in 1967, which was a continuation of the monthly newsletter, published weekly instead of monthly, in a different format, with advertising, which became a cornerstone of IDG's subsequent publishing arm. McGovern subsequently founded PC World. IDG Books, which was a public company spun off from the privately held IDG, published the popular self-help \"...For Dummies\" books. The \"...For Dummies\" range was originally limited to computer related fields, but later expanded to include a much wider variety of topics. The series is now published by John Wiley & Sons. IDG Books/Hungry Minds \u2014 as IDG Books was briefly renamed before being sold to Wiley in 2001, it no longer exists as a separate company. In 2010, IDG introduced the \"Nanosite\", an advertising tool designed as an alternative to a microsite. Following McGovern's death in March 2014, ownership of the corporation passed to the McGovern Foundation, with several layoffs occurring as a result. In January 2017, following IDG's announcement that it was searching for a buyer, it was acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group. Later that year a second round of layoffs occurred, including up to ninety editors and writers from IDG's consumer and enterprise publications. In August 2019, Mohamad Ali was named as Global CEO of IDG. Prior to joining IDG, Ali held the positions of President and CEO of Carbonite and Chief Strategy Officer of Hewlett- Packard.https://www.techfunnel.com/hr-tech/mohamad-ali-ceo-international-data- group/ ===Digital News as an example=== Digital News is no longer one of their hundreds of periodicals published worldwide. It was focused on computers produced by Digital Equipment Corporation when DEC was #2 to IBM. In 1988 IDG's Digital News acquired 1980-founded Hardcopy magazine. (stylized HARDCOPY) Back then, IDG competitor Ziff Davis published \"a third DEC-users journal, Boston-based Digital Review.\" The DEC Professional was the fourth player. In 1997, The New York Times referred to IDG as \"the No. 2 producer of technology publications, after Ziff-Davis Publishing.\" As of 2020, DEC is long gone, as are these DEC-focused publications. ==Businesses== IDG has \"approximately#280 in 1997 300 technology publications worldwide\" and its own international news agency, IDG News Service, headquartered in Boston.with bureaus in cities such as New York, Beijing, Amsterdam and Brussels. {cite web |title=Bureaus - IDG.com |url=http://www.idg.com/www/home.nsf/docs/bureaus#Amsterdam%20Bureau |work=IDG.com |publisher=IDG |accessdate=12 November 2012 |archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004023411/http://idg.com/www/home.nsf/docs/bureaus#Amsterdam%20Bureau#Amsterdam%20Bureau |archive-date=2012-10-04 |url-status=live}} IDG Connect produces, publishes and distributes local IT and business information.
