In this last sermon, the Buddha urged his disciples to strive for enlightenment through thorough monastic discipline. According to Cleary, \"the Buddha teaches here from the perspective of cause and effect: pure discipline is a basic necessity because it allows good qualities to develop.\"Cleary, J.C. (2005). The Bequeathed Teaching Sutra. In: Arai, K.; Bando, S.; Cleary, J.C.; Gregory, P.N.; Shih, H.; Apocryphal Scriptures , Berkeley, Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, , p.3 The Buddha warns against seeking material wealth, influence, and discourages monks from earning a living through fortune telling or the performance of healing. The Buddha concludes by declaring the sutra his last teaching. The sutra \"is used as a liturgical text in both Taiwan and Japan, where it seems to be particularly associated with the Soto Zen sect.\" It was frequently cited or the subject of commentary during the Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties. It was a perennial source of reference and instruction for Chinese Chan communities. ==See also== * Buddhist apocrypha * Chinese Buddhist canon * Buddhist texts ==References== ==External links== * Chinese text from the Taisho Tripitaka, Volume 12, No. 389, CBETA Category:Mahayana sutras Category:Mahayana texts ",
