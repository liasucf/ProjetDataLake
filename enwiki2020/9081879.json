    "text": "Manuel S\u00e1nchez Delgado (born 17 January 1965), known as Manolo, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker. Over nine seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 292 matches and 96 goals, mainly with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid with whom he won two major titles. He also competed at that level with Murcia. Manolo represented Spain at the 1990 World Cup. ==Club career== Born in C\u00e1ceres, Extremadura, Manolo grew up in the ranks of local CP Cacere\u00f1o, making his senior debut with the club at the age of 17. After two years with CE Sabadell FC, the last in the second division, he moved to Real Murcia in the same level, helping it promote to La Liga in his first season then scoring 11 goals in 36 appearances in the following campaign, with the team retaining their top flight status. In summer 1988, Manolo signed with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he knew his most successful years, forming a formidable attacking partnership with Paulo Futre. With countless assists from the Portuguese, he was crowned top scorer in 1991\u201392 with 27 goals, adding that season's \u2013 and the previous \u2013 Copa del Rey trophies. Manolo retired from the game in 1997, after two seasons with CP M\u00e9rida (one in the second tier) where he failed to appear in any matches due to a serious tibia injury, as he was just four goals shy of 100 in the Spanish top flight. He started coaching in 2007, first with Gal\u00e1ctico Pegaso, going on to spend several years in the lower leagues. ==International career== Manolo made his debut for Spain immediately after having been bought by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, appearing and scoring against Republic of Ireland on 16 November 1988 for the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification stages. He went on to total 28 caps and nine goals, representing the nation in the finals in Italy where he only appeared in the first group stage game against Uruguay (0\u20130). ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" |+ ! # !!
