The 222nd Mixed Brigade (), was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the summer of 1937 with battalions of the Carabineros corps. Its only commander was the Carabineros Lieutenant Tiburcio D\u00edaz Carrasco.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep\u00fablica, 1999; p. 221 ==History== The 222nd Mixed Brigade was established in the summer 1937 in Lorca, V\u00e9lez-Rubio, Alhama and Totana. It was organized with the following Carabineros battalions: *18th, which became the 885 Battalion of the mixed brigade. *19th, which became the 886 Battalion. *24th, which became the 887 Battalion. *38th, which became the 888 Battalion. Two of these battalions were from the 86th Mixed Brigade. ===First phase=== The brigade was first engaged in Coastal Defence under the Group of Central Region Armies (GERC) and its members were garrisoned in Cartagena, guarding the town's military facilities. In December 1937 the 222nd Mixed Brigade became part of the reserve of the Andalusian Army, relieving the 87th Mixed Brigade of its duties in the coast of Almer\u00eda. In late February 1938 the unit was placed under the 40th Division of the XIX Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Levante) and moved to the Teruel Front. However it arrived to the Teruel area when the combats were over. ===Levante Offensive and end of the unit=== The brigade took part in the effort to fight back the rebel Levante Offensive where it recaptured the Cota 1.196 and the V\u00e9rtice Marr\u00f3n positions from the enemy. For these actions the 40th Division, to which the brigade belonged, was awarded the Medal of Bravery. In July 1938 the 40th Division was placed under the XVII Army Corps led by Lieutenant Colonel Garc\u00eda Vallejo. When the Francoist offensive in the Levant ended, the brigade remained in the same sector as strategic reserve until the end of the Civil War. The final fate of some of the brigade's members is unknown. ==See also== *Mixed Brigades *Carabineros ==References== ==External links== *Condecorados con la Medalla del Valor - Combatientes *Jumillanos desaparecidos y fallecidos en el a\u00f1o 1938 Category:Military units and formations established in 1937 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 Category:Mixed Brigades (Spain) Category:Carabineros ",
