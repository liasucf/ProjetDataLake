While attending the University of Akron, he worked full-time as production worker, then as supervisor, for B.F. Goodrich and Company. It took him nine years to earn his B.A. degree. Upon his graduation in 1939, he was employed by the University of Akron as Assistant Adviser of Men and later as the Assistant to the Director of Adult Education. He left Akron in 1942 to pursue graduate studies at the University of Chicago, but his studies were interrupted because of his service as executive officer of a minesweeper in the U.S. Navy during World War II in the Pacific. He enrolled in Cornell University's newly established program of industrial and labor relations (ILR) in 1945 and was awarded its first Ph.D. degree in 1948. Upon receiving his doctorate he joined the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations faculty. In 1949, he was named director of the School's Office of Resident Instruction, graduate field representative, and professor. He served as dean of faculty from 1957 to 1961. In 1961, he was named as president of Gettysburg College. He served in that capacity until 1977 due to a series of health problems. He died in 1983. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations alumni Category:University of Akron alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Cornell University faculty Category:Gettysburg College faculty Category:Presidents of Gettysburg College ",
