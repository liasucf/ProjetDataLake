    "text": "Eastern Washington is the region of the U.S. state of Washington located east of the Cascade Range. It contains the city of Spokane (the second largest city in the state), the Tri-Cities, the Columbia River and the Grand Coulee Dam, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the fertile farmlands of the Yakima Valley and the Palouse. Unlike in Western Washington, the climate is dry, including some desert environments. ==Climate== K\u00f6ppen climate types in eastern Washington A significant difference between Eastern Washington and the western half of the state is its climate. While the west half of the state is located in a rainy oceanic climate, the eastern half receives little rainfall due to the rainshadow created by the Cascade Mountains. Also, due to being farther from the sea, the east side has both hotter summers and colder winters than the west. Most communities in Eastern Washington, for example, have significant yearly snowfall, while in the west snowfall is minimal and not seen every year. The east and west do still have some climatic traits in common, though: more rainfall in winter than summer, a lack of severe storms, and milder temperature ranges than more inland locations. There is some variation in both rainfall throughout Eastern Washington. Generally, lower elevations are both hotter and drier than higher elevations. This is easily seen in the comparison between low-elevation Richland with higher elevation Spokane. ==Geography== ===Nomenclature=== Other terms used for Eastern Washington or large parts of it include: *Columbia Basin *Eastside or east side of the state *Inland Empire/Inland Northwest (also includes the Idaho Panhandle) ===Cities=== Spokane is the largest city in eastern Washington and the metropolitan center of the Inland Empire region The following cities and towns in Eastern Washington have over 10,000 inhabitants.Population figures are the most recent figures contained in the respective Wikipedia articles, or in the List of cities in Washington. *Spokane (pop. 217,300) *Spokane Valley (pop. 94,919) *Yakima (pop. 93,701) *Kennewick (pop. 80,280) *Pasco (pop. 71,680) *Richland (pop. 54,150) *Wenatchee (pop. 34,070) *Walla Walla (pop. 33,840) *Pullman (pop. 33,280) *Moses Lake (pop. 22,720) *Ellensburg (pop. 19,550) *Sunnyside (pop. 16,640) *West Richland (pop. 14,660) *East Wenatchee (pop. 13,600) *Cheney (pop. 11,880) *Grandview (pop. 11,170) ===National Parks and other protected areas=== The summit of Goat Peak in the Okanogan National Forest *Hanford Reach National Monument *Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area *Juniper Dunes Wilderness *Salmo-Priest Wilderness *Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness (partial) ====Limited protection areas==== *Colville National Forest *Idaho Panhandle National Forest (partial) *Kaniksu National Forest (partial) *Okanogan National Forest *Umatilla National Forest (partial) *Wenatchee National Forest *Columbia National Wildlife Refuge *Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge *Little Pend Oreille National Wildlife Refuge *McNary National Wildlife Refuge *Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge *Toppenish National Wildlife Refuge *Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge *Umatilla National Wildlife Refuge (partial) ===Counties=== Eastern Washington is composed of Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima counties.

Bills in the Washington State Legislature which would have requested the United States Congress to take up the question were proposed in 1996, 1999, 2005, and 2017. Proposed names for the new state have included Lincoln, Columbia, Liberty, or simply Eastern Washington. Many of these proposals would include the Idaho Panhandle as part of the proposed state of Lincoln. Eastern Washington tends to vote Republican, whereas Western Washington usually supports the Democrats. ==Images== File:Palouse Hills from Steptoe Butte.jpg|The Palouse Hills of southeastern Washington File:Dry Falls.jpg|Dry Falls in the semi-desert Channeled Scablands that dominate much of eastern Washington.
