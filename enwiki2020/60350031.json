The Eagles played their home games at Paulson Stadium in Statesboro, Georgia and competed in the East Division of the Sun Belt Conference. They were led by second year head coach Chad Lunsford. ==Previous season== The Eagles finished the 2018 season 10\u20133, 6\u20132 in Sun Belt play to finish in third place in the East division. The Eagles received an invitation to the Camellia Bowl where they defeated Eastern Michigan. ==Preseason== On August 2, 2019, it was announced that QB Shai Werts and DE Quan Griffin had been indefinitely suspended following their arrests, which were not related. The charges against Werts were subsequently dropped, after what was believed to be cocaine on his car was tested to be bird feces, and he has since been cleared to play. ==Schedule== Source: ==Game summaries== ===at LSU=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |colspan=3|First meeting |} ===Maine=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20130 | Dec. 10, 2011 | W, 35\u201323 |} ===at Minnesota=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |colspan=3|First meeting |} ===Louisiana=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1\u20131 | Nov. 25, 2017 | W, 34\u201324 |} ===at South Alabama=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 5\u20130 | Oct. 6, 2018 | W, 48\u201313 |} ===Coastal Carolina=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20131 | Nov. 17, 2018 | W, 41\u201317 |} ===New Mexico State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20131 | Oct. 20, 2018 | W, 48\u201331 |} ===at Appalachian State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 14\u201319\u20131 | Oct. 25, 2018 | W, 34\u201314 |} ===at Troy=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 6\u201312 | Nov. 10, 2018 | L, 21\u201335 |} ===Louisiana\u2013Monroe=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 5\u20133 | Nov. 3, 2018 | L, 25\u201344 |} ===at Arkansas State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u20132 | Sep. 29, 2018 | W, 28\u201321 |} ===Georgia State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u20133 | Nov. 24, 2018 | W, 35\u201314 |} ===vs. Liberty (Cure Bowl)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | colspan=3| First meeting |} ==Players drafted into the NFL== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"text-align:center; \" | Round || Pick || Player || Position || NFL Club |- | 5 || 163 || Kindle Vildor || CB || Chicago Bears |- | 6 || 188 || Tyler Bass || K || Buffalo Bills |} ==References== Georgia Southern Category:Georgia Southern Eagles football seasons Georgia Southern Eagles football ",
