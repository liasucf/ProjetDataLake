    "text": "Powers Park is an unincorporated community located east-southeast of Marietta in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. Powers Park consists of the 'Powers Ferry 01' voting precinct (see map). The community is defined by Interstate 75 to the southwest, Fern Street / Smithstone Road to the southeast, Lower Roswell Road to the northeast and South Marietta Parkway to the northwest. Powers Creek, Little Road and Powers Ferry Road run through the heart of the area. Powers Park consists mostly of single family residential homes and small neighborhoods built between 1950 and 1980. The community united in 2005 to fight a proposed widening of Interstate 75 that would have negatively impacted home values. The area is popular with young homeowners, attracted by spacious, wooded lots and the community's proximity to Interstate 75, Interstate 285, the bustling Cumberland / Galleria business district, Truist Park - home of the Atlanta Braves - and its connected entertainment district, The Battery.
