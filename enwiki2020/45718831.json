It is located on one of the most famous streets in France, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. The current British Ambassador to France is Edward Llewellyn, Baron Llewellyn of Steep. The embassy also represents the British Overseas Territories in France. There are British consulates in Bordeaux and Marseille. ==Ambassador's Residence== H\u00f4tel de Charost, the official residence of the British Ambassador The official residence of the British ambassador to France since 1814 has been the H\u00f4tel de Charost, located at 39 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, just a few doors down from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. It was built in 1720 and bought by the Duke of Wellington in 1814. Napoleon's sister, Princess Borghese, joined her brother in exile to Elba, an island between Corsica and Italy. Penury forced the sale of this jewel looking house on rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 to the British government for use as their embassy. It had been the home of the Duke of Wellington for 5 months because he had been appointed Britain's ambassador to the court of Louis XVIII. ==See also== *France-United Kingdom relations *List of diplomatic missions in France *List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France ==References== Paris United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in the 8th arrondissement of Paris Category:France\u2013United Kingdom relations ",
