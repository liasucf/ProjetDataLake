The district was formed as Afan on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reorganisation of local government in England and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district was named after the River Afan and was granted a charter bestowing the status of a borough. The Borough of Afan was created by the amalgamation of the areas of the municipal borough of Port Talbot and the urban district of Glyncorrwg, both previously part of the administrative county of Glamorgan.Schedule 4: Local government areas in Wales, Local Government Act 1972 (c.70) Following a resolution passed by the borough council, the borough was renamed as Port Talbot on 1 January 1986.
