    "text": "Ayala Bridge is a steel truss bridge over the Pasig River in Manila, Philippines. It connects the districts of Ermita and San Miguel, passing over the western tip of Isla de Convalecencia. It carries Circumferential Road 1 (C-1) and National Route 180 (N180), linking Ayala Boulevard in Ermita to P. Casal Street in San Miguel. ==History== 2015 rehabilitation of the bridge. Ayala Bridge was originally two separate timber-built bridges (divided into the \"San Miguel\" & \"Concepcion\" sections after each side's point of origin, converging into Isla de la ConvalescenciaThe bridge was also sometimes called Puente de Convalescencia) when it was first built in 1872 by Don Jacobo Z\u00f3bel y Zangroniz of Casa R\u00f3xas (the present-day Ayala Corporation). Scarcely 10 years after it was opened to traffic, the bridge's condition had degenerated considerably that in 1899, the \"San Miguel\" portion collapsed, with \"Concepcion\" following suit months later. Steel became the main material in 1908, and Ayala Bridge became the first steel bridge in the Philippines. Its current form is attributed to a 1930s reconstruction, when it was decided to unify the bridge in a singular route. Ayala Bridge was closed to the public in early 2015 to undergo rehabilitation and structural repairs to ensure structural integrity. It was raised by , enabling it to withstand a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. The bridge fully reopened to the motorists in November 2015. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Pasig River ==References== Category:Bridges in Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Ermita Category:Buildings and structures in San Miguel, Manila Category:Spanish colonial infrastructure in the Philippines Category:Bridges completed in 2015 Category:Bridges completed in 1908 Category:Bridges completed in 1872 Category:1872 establishments in the Philippines ",
