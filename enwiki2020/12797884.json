He most lately played for Veikkausliiga club SJK. ==Club career== ===Kuressaare=== Aksalu joined the youth system of his hometown club Kuressaare and played for their reserve team Muhumaa (renamed S\u00f6rve in 2002). He made his debut in the Meistriliiga in his single appearance for Kuressaare on 23 September 2000, in a 4\u20131 away win over Valga. ===Flora=== In December 2002, Aksalu was included in Flora's first team squad for pre-season training.

His first trophy with Flora came in the 2007\u201308 Estonian Cup. ===Sheffield United=== On 29 January 2010, following a successful trial, Aksalu signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Championship club Sheffield United for a transfer fee of \u00a3180,000. Kevin Blackwell, Sheffield United's manager at the time, claimed Aksalu was the best goalkeeping triallist he had seen in a long time and had the potential to become Estonia's number one. However, Aksalu failed to impress new manager Gary Speed and was unable to break into the first team. On 6 October 2010, Aksalu joined Conference National club Mansfield Town on a two-month loan. He remained sidelined through most of his spell due to an abdominal muscle problem, making only three appearances before returning to Bramall Lane in December.

In October 2013, Aksalu signed a new two-year contract with the club. On 24 August 2015, his contract was extended to 2017. Aksalu won the Veikkausliiga title in the 2015 season.
