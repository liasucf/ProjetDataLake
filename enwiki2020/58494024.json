She was wrecked in June 1796. Hercules appeared in the 1795 volume of Lloyd's Register with B[enjamin] Stout, master, Ed. Jones, owner, and trade London\u2013Madeira.Lloyd's Register (1795) \"M\" Supple. pages, Seq.\u2116M515. The EIC hired Hercules in Bengal to carry rice to England. She was carrying the rice on behalf of the British government, which was importing grain to address high prices for wheat in Britain following a poor harvest. Hercules sailed from Calcutta on 17 March 1796. On 16 June she wrecked at Kaffraria, on the East Coast of Africa, north of the Cape of Good Hope. Thirteen of her crew drowned and the survivors reached the Cape.Lloyd's List Captain Stout later wrote an account of his adventures, though much of his account of the region through which he travelled came in for criticism as being a fabrication.London Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, Etc. (27 November 1819), #149, pp.755-6. The EIC charged the loss of the cargo to \"His Majesty's Government\". ==Citations and references== Citations References * *Reports from the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the present state of the affairs of the East India Company, together with the minutes of evidence, an appendix of documents, and a general index, (1830), Vol. 2, p.977. * Category:1792 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of the United States Category:Ships of the British East India Company Category:Maritime incidents in 1796 ",
