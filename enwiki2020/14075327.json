The diocese comprises the d\u00e9partement of Charente-Maritime and the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. The bishop is a suffragan of the Archbishop of Bordeaux. The episcopal seat is in La Rochelle Cathedral. Saintes Cathedral is a co-cathedral. ==History== The Diocese of La Rochelle was erected on 4 May 1648.Jean, p. 147. David M. Cheney, Catholic- Hierarchy: Diocese of La Rochelle (-Saintes). Retrieved: 2016-08-13 The Diocese of Maillezais was transferred on 7 May 1648, to La Rochelle. This diocese before the French Revolution, aside from Maillezais, included the present arrondissements of Marennes, Rochefort, La Rochelle, and a part of Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly. During the French Revolution, the Diocese of Saintes and the Diocese of La Rochelle were combined into the Diocese of Charente- Inferieure, under the direction of a Constitutional Bishop, salaried by and responsible to the French Republic. There was a schism with Rome and the Pope. On 15 July 1801, Pope Pius VII signed a new Concordat with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, who had overthrown the Directorate in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799);Andr\u00e9 Latreille, Napol\u00e9on et le Saint-Si\u00e8ge, 1801\u20131808: l'ambassade du Cardinal Fesch \u00e0 Rome (Paris, 1935), pp. 1\u201321. Fesch was Napoleon's uncle. the terms included the suppression of the Dioceses of Saintes and Lu\u00e7on, which was carried out on 29 November 1801. The entire territory of the former Diocese of Saintes, except for the part in Charente belonging to the Diocese of Angoul\u00eame, and the entire Diocese of Lu\u00e7on, were added to the Diocese of La Rochelle. In 1821 a see was again established at Lu\u00e7on, and had under its jurisdiction, aside from the former Diocese of Lu\u00e7on, almost the entire former Diocese of Maillezais; so that Maillezais, once transferred to La Rochelle, no longer belongs to the diocese, now known as La Rochelle et Saintes. Saintes Cathedral is the Co-Cathedral of the diocese St. Louis of France is the titular saint of the cathedral of La Rochelle and the patron of the city. St. Eutropius, first Bishop of Saintes, is the principal patron of the present diocese of La Rochelle. In this diocese are especially honoured: St. Gemme, martyr (century unknown); St. Seronius, martyr (third century); St. Martin, Abbot of the Saintes monastery (fifth century); St. Vaise, martyr about 500; St. Maclovius (Malo), first Bishop of Aleth, Brittany, who died in Saintonge about 570; Saint Amand, Bishop of Maastricht (seventh century). From 1534 La Rochelle and the Province of Aunis were a centre of Calvinism. In 1573 the city successfully resisted the Duke of Anjou, brother of Charles IX of France, and remained the chief fortress of the Huguenots in France. But in 1627 the alliance of La Rochelle with the English proved to Louis XIII and to Richelieu that the political independence of the Protestants would be a menace to France; the famous siege of La Rochelle (5 August 1627 \u2013 28 October 1628), in the course of which the population was reduced from 18,000 inhabitants to 5000, terminated with a capitulation which put an end to the political claims of the Calvinistic minority. The Chapter of the Cathedral of Saint-Louis was composed of eight dignitaries and twenty Canons. The dignitaries were the Dean (elected by the Chapter), the Treasurer, the Almoner, the Grand Archdeacon, the Archdeacon of Fontenay, the Cantor, the Subcantor and the Archdeacon of Bressuire\u2014all appointed by the bishop. A seminary was established by royal order, with an income of 3000 livres, derived from an assessment on all of the benefices in the diocese. The seminary was entrusted to the Jesuits in 1694 by Bishop de la Frezeli\u00e8re, two of whose brothers were Jesuits. During the French Revolution, when the Civil Constitution of the Clergy instituted a national church, and the nation was redivided into dioceses which matched as far as possible the civil departments into which the administration of the state was divided, the diocese of Saintes and the diocese of La Rochelle were combined into the Diocese of Charente- Inferieure. Both Bishop de La Rochefoucauld and Bishop de Coucy refused to take the oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution, as required by law. They were therefore deposed. The electors of Charente-Infeurieure assembled on 27 February 1791 and elected Fr. Isaac-\u00c9tienne Robinet, the cur\u00e9 of Saint- Savinien-du-Port as their Constitutional Bishop. He made his formal entry into Saintes on 31 March, and took formal possession of the cathedral on 10 April. He roused up the anti-clerical feelings of the populace against the non- jurors, but, once roused, they turned against all the clergy, including Robinet. Bishop Robinet resigned on 6 December 1793, and took up residence with his brother at Torx\u00e9, where he died on 8 September 1797. On 1 March 2018, the Apostolic Vicariate of Iles Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, which had existed since 1763, was suppressed and the French overseas collectivity Saint-Pierre and Miquelon added to this Diocese. ==Bishops== * 1648\u20131661 Jacques Raoul de la Guibourg\u00e8reGauchat, p. 298 (wrongly named Joannes). * 1661\u20131693 Henri de Laval de Boisdauphin * 1693\u20131702 Charles-Madeleine Fr\u00e9zeau de Fr\u00e9zeli\u00e8reCharles-Madeleine was the son of Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9zeau de Fr\u00e9zeli\u00e8re, Lieutenant-General of Artillery and Governor of Salines.
