    "text": "Data Moving tool (DMT) is a Windows based ETL that extracts, transforms and loads data to and from any data source. DMT was created by S.E.R. Software Solutions, a small California software company. DMT is designed to handle small to medium data volumes. == Overview / architecture == DMT is a Windows application composed of the DMT client and the DMT service. The DMT client allows users to create, manage and run extracts and loads from a windows user interface. Extracts and loads can be run on demand from the client. The DMT service contains the DMT scheduler that automatically runs extracts and loads at specific times, dates or intervals. The DMT service is a windows service that runs in the background without any user interaction (typically on a server). DMT uses the Microsoft .NET framework (2.0 and above) and communicates with databases through ODBC. == Functionalities == ===Data extraction (exports)=== Data can be extracted from any ODBC data source. Users enter their own SQL statement to extract the data. Extracted data can be saved into data files in many formats (CSV, Tab delimited, HTML, delimited text, etc.) or reused by a load. ===Data load (imports)=== Data can be loaded data into any ODBC data source. It can be loaded into one or several destination tables (in the same or different databases). The data to load can come from any ODBC data source or data files in many formats (created by DMT or another program). ===Data transformation=== Data can be transformed before it is loaded into a destination table (e.g. Data combination, filtering, calculations, etc.). DMT can perform its own transformation with predefined functions and operators or let the target database perform the transformations with the target database set of functions and operators. ===Scheduling=== Extracts and loads can be scheduled to run automatically at specific times, dates or intervals. DMT's scheduler handles 4 configurable scheduling frequencies: Regular Interval, Daily, Weekly and Monthly (e.g. 1st Monday of each month, last day of each month, every 10th of the month, etc.). ===Pre and post processes=== DMT can execute external processes before and after the run of extracts and loads. * Run SQL statements or stored procedures * Execute external programs (i.e. run a command line) * Upload or download files via FTP * Send emails (with attachment containing exported or loaded data) ===Run pre- conditions=== Run pre-conditions allow extracts and loads to be triggered only if specified conditions are met. * Check the result of an SQL statement * Check the presence or content of a file ==Supported databases== DMT supports any ODBC compliant database, e.g. Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase, IBM DB2 / Informix, MySQL, MS Access and many more including old ones (Visual FoxPro, DBase, etc.) ==Version releases== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" !
