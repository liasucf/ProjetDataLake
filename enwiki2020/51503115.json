The name comes from prohibition-era slang meaning \"the best.\" ==History== The Bee's Knees was invented by Frank Meier, an Austrian-born, part Jewish bartender who was the first head bartender at the Ritz in Paris in 1921, when its Cafe Parisian opened its doors.https://www.thedailybeast.com/frank-meier-the-paris-ritzs-mysterious- bartender-spy ==Variations== A Bee's Knees cocktail made with gin, 1:1 honey syrup, and lemon juice * Barr Hill Gin is sometimes recommended for its honey infusion, though other gins may be used (including Barr Hill's Tom Cat gin). * The honey may be diluted 1:1 with warm water to thin the consistency. * The honey may be diluted 1:1 with simple syrup instead of water. * A sprig of basil may be used for garnish instead of lemon peel. * Some variations contain orange juice * Add 2 dashes of Absinthe and 2 dashes of orange bitters to make a variation called \"Oldest Living Confederate Widow\" ==References== Category:Cocktails with gin Category:Citrus cocktails Category:Three- ingredient cocktails ",
