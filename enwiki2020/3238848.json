Since 1765 it has been owned by the crown, first used as naval academy and since 1828 as residence of various part of the royal family, among those King Frederick VIII. Therefore, the palace is also known as Frederick VIII's Palace. It is one of the two palaces facing the Amaliehaven waterfront, the other being the residence of the Queen and Prince Consort. From 1947 until 1972 it was the official residence of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid. The Crown Prince moved into the Palace 1934, and it was in use by the late Queen until her death 2000.
