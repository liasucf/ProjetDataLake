But like the rest of the cast, she hardly gets a chance to prove her mettle\" and concluded, \"the film has a lyrical title and that too a chaste Tamil one. But start viewing the film and you'll realise soon enough that the film is a far cry from the impression its title conveys\". ==References== Category:2005 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian thriller films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Tamil film scores by Ilaiyaraaja Category:2005 thriller films ",
