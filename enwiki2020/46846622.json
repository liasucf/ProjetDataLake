He was baptised the same day, at the Parish Church of G\u0127arb. His godparents were \u0120u\u017ceppi and Carmela Grima, the latter one is said to have heard the voice of Our Lady in the small chapel of Ta\u2019 Pinu, the same church \u0120u\u017ceppi helped build and became rector later on in life. \u0120u\u017ceppi had 8 other siblings, 3 sisters and 5 brothers. Four of his brothers, Pio, Grazio, Salv and Karm, became priests while the other brother, Mikiel married. The sisters, Tere\u017cina, \u0120u\u017ceppa and Rosalina, never married. ==Priesthood== \u0120u\u017cepp studied in the Gozo Major Seminary under the Jesuits. He was admired for his brilliant mind and for his prudence and profound spirituality. He was ordained by the Bishop of Gozo Giovanni Maria Camilleri in the Gozo Cathedral on 21 December 1907. As a young priest, Reverend Portelli exercised his pastoral ministry in the village of San Lawrenz, where his eldest brother, Monsignor Salv Portelli, served as parish priest. When the Jesuits left the Gozo Seminary with a view to open a similar college in Malta, Reverend Portelli, who had become a lecturer at the Seminary, was called by Bishop Camilleri to become one of the new superiors of the Seminary and was made Vice Rector. Other superiors were Reverend Alfons Hili, who was the Rector, and Reverend Joseph Farrugia, who was the Prefect of Studies. Reverend Portelli was also made a Monsignor of the cathedral chapter. Monsignor Portelli was also a renowned preacher who was often invited to deliver sermons and spiritual exercises in several churches in Malta and Gozo. Once, during Lent, was asked to preach to the Maltese Community of Tripoli. Monsignor Portelli was also confessor of the Franciscan and Dominican Sisters of Victoria. Every Saturday evening, Monsignor Portelli used to go to Ta 'Pinu to celebrate mass. During this time his brother, Monsignor Karm Portelli was Archpriest of the Collegiate church of Gharb. Monsignor Portelli served as administrator of Ghasri, Nadur, Qala and Ta 'Sannat when the post of parish priest became vacant. In 1933, several centres of Catholic Action started to emerge in Gozo and Monsignor Portelli became the Spiritual Director of the branch of G\u0127arb. Here he used to give religious lessons and organized retreats for its members.\"Ta' Pinu National Shrine - Gozo, Malta\", Malta, 07 March 2015. Retrieved on 30 May 2015.
