    "text": "A vodka and cola is a cocktail that, in its simplest form, is made by pouring vodka into a glass and adding cola. Taylor Swift, a brand ambassador for Diet Coke, said her favorite cocktail is a vodka and Diet Coke. ==Variants== The southern style vodka and coke is made by pouring a reduction of Coca-Cola into a glass and adding vodka and orange flower water. Other variants involve adding citrus fruit juice (e.g. lemon and lime); using flavored vodka (e.g. cherry or black cherry vodka); using flavored Coke; using flavored syrups or vanilla extract; adding fresh herbs; muddling fresh fruit; or adding ice cream to make an ice cream float. A Coke float cocktail, made of whipped cream vodka, vanilla extract, heavy whipping cream, and Coca-Cola, foams up like an ice cream float, although it does not contain any ice cream. The Long Black Russian cocktail adds cola to Kahlua and vodka, to add bubbles and create the taste of a mocha-flavored cola. ==References== Category:Cocktails with vodka Category:Cocktails with cola ",
