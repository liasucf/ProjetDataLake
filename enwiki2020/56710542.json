Some of her most controversial subjects include the experiences of sex workers, a trade outlawed in Zimbabwe. These writings were published in two anthologies by the Zimbabwe Women Writers in Shona, Masimba and a version in isiNdebele. 7 Her most popular published works include: Destiny (Corals Services, 2006). A book on Destiny that deals with a subject that is viewed as taboo in Zimbabwe - Hermaphrodites (LGBTI community) and their everyday reality. Highway Queen (Corals Services, 2010). A book that touches on the daily global challenges of unemployment, poverty, crime, health, education, and economics from a woman's perspective. Desperate (2002) (Xavier F Carelse, 2002 and 2013). A collection of stories about the circumstances that lead women to commercial sex workers, and their lived experiences. The book was inspired by a real life experience as a guerrilla during the Rhodesian Bush War, when she sought refuge with sex workers when she found her life was at risk owing to her activism. Phiri's writings have been used for academic university purposes in Zimbabwe and the world over for research as well for Doctorates. In 2006, Desperate was discussed by students from Prof. Ruby Magosvongwe's English class before examinations. That gave Virginia Phiri an opportunity to interact with students and discuss Desperate at length.University of Zimbabwe Department of English in its courses. In 2012 at the Cape Town Book Fair Phiri had an opportunity to speak to students from the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch in relation to her book Destiny, which addresses LGBTIQ issues. The South African students were led by Professor Meg Samuelson. Also present were Zimbabwean academics Professor Kizito Muchemwa and Professor Faith Mkwesha, who were at that time based in South Africa. Destiny (2006) is one of the few books that has addressed LGBTIQ issues. In 2014, German publisher Peter Hammer Veerlag commissioned her to contribute to the book Visionare Afrikas on the first black African woman Nobel Peace Prize winner, Professor Wangari Maathai. Her contribution was translated into German. Phiri went into self-publishing following encouragement by the late University of Zimbabwe lecturer Dr Xavier Carelse, who noted that she had struggled to have her book Desperate published due to the taboo issue of sex work. He later partnered her in publishing it. ==Family== Virginia Phiri is married to Werner Fibeck.
