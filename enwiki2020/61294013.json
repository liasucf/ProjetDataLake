His tertiary education was undertaken at Reading University in the United Kingdom, and Grootfontein Agricultural College back in South Africa. For the next 17 years after completing his tertiary education, Skead farmed in the Grahamstown district. It was during his farming career that he started observing birds in the vicinity which led to his first publication appearing in the journal Ostrich (journal) in 1943. In 1949, Skead took up the position of Director at the Kaffrarian Museum (now the Amathole Museum). He also served as a research officer for the Percy FitzPatrick Institute, a research institute associated with the University of Cape Town from 1961 to 1966, after which he returned to the museum where he remained until his retirement in 1972. ==Legacy== Skead contributed to the scholarly knowledge through producing more than 100 journal articles and books, including Sunbirds of South Africa, Canaries, seedeaters and buntings, and Historical Incidence of the Larger Mammals. ==Honours== * 1966 Gill Memorial Medal from the Southern African Ornithological Society * 1977 Gold Medal from the Zoological Society of Southern Africa * 1982 Honorary Doctorate from Rhodes University * 2002 Gold Medal from the Grassland Society * 2004 Honorary Doctorate from the University of Port Elizabeth * 2005 Special Award from the Eastern Cape Government ==References== ==External links== * C.
