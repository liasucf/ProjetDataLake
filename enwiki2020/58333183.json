Ten amateur bakers competed over eight weeks of challenges throughout the competition for the title. Canadian actor and television personality Dan Levy and British actress Julia Chan returned as hosts, with French chef Bruno Feldeisen and Canadian-Australian pastry chef Rochelle Adonis also returning as judges. For the second season, producer Marike Emery stated that the audition process prioritized \"skill over personality\" and that the tasks would be more challenging than the first season. After eight weeks of competition, Andrei Godoroja was crowned the winner with Sachin Seth and Megan Stasiewich as runners-up. This was also the last season for hosts Dan Levy and Julia Chan, as well as judge Rochelle Adonis. == Bakers == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Baker ! Age ! Profession !

The Technical Challenge gave them two hours and 15 minutes to create two dozen palmiers, 12 sweet and 12 savoury, using rough puff pastry. For the Showstopper Challenge, bakers had four and a half hours to produce a basket of 18 breakfast pastries\u2014six croissants, six Danish, and six sweet buns. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !

The tart itself could be any shape or flavour as long as chocolate was the \"star\" ingredient. The uniquely time-sensitive nature of the Technical Challenge, one hour and 45 minutes to bake a chocolate souffl\u00e9, required that the bakers' starting times be staggered and the judges taste each souffl\u00e9 fresh from the oven. Finally, the Showstopper Challenge required the bakers to create a modern re-imagining of the Black Forest cake. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! Baker !

For the Technical Challenge, they had two hours, 15 minutes to make 12 miniature jocondes, a cake of layered and filled almond sponge and mousse. The Showstopper gave them four hours to produce 36 savoury canap\u00e9s: 12 with puff pastry, 12 tartlets, and 12 finger sandwiches. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! Baker !

The Technical Challenge was to produce a Swedish Princess cake in two hours and 15 minutes. For the final showstopper, the bakers had to prepare a Choux pastry tower with at least three layers, and a minimum of two shapes of choux and three flavours of fillings, in four and a half hours; it was the hottest day of filming, handicapping the bakers in assembling their chocolate and cream towers. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !
