    "text": "Cesare Orlandi (Citt\u00e0 della Pieve, 26 luglio 1734 \u2013 Perugia, 20 dicembre 1779) was an Italian writer and historian. He was a nobleman of Fermo, Atri and Citt\u00e0 della Pieve,It is written at the bottom of the drawing on first page of volume I of his book Delle citt\u00e0 d'Italia and he's known only for his work Delle citt\u00e0 d'Italia e sue isole adjacenti [sic] compendiose notizievolume I (1770-1778), which contains comprehensive details and high-quality landscape views of many Italian cities (a landscape view is attached at the beginning of each section and for each city). It was published in volumes over almost a decade (1770-1778). He is likely to be the \"Abatte Cesare Orlandi\" who edited and published an edition of Cesare Ripa's \"Iconology\" in 1764, which contains a portrait. His work remained unfinished due to the author's death, occurred in 1779, and the Italian cities covered in his work span from letter A (Volume IC. Orlandi - Volume I) to letter C (Volume VC. Orlandi - Volume V). The work is often a valuable source of information about the structure, architecture, history and social organization of many Italian cities up to the XVIII century.
