The term text neck was first coined by Dr. Dean L. Fishman, a US chiropractor. Much bending forward has always caused the problems of a hunched upper back and neck pain, for example in dentists, surgeons, and hairdressers. What has changed in the last decade is the amount, especially in a younger generation who have grown up bending over laptops, tablets and smartphones \u2013 hence the term 'iHunch'. Because the problem arises specifically from much bending forward, logical treatment will counter each component of this. The iHunch: (1) Overworked muscles down the back of the neck strengthen, strain, scar and shorten; (2) middle and lower back support muscles weaken; (3) hunching upper back joints eventually freeze like that; (4) muscles at the front of the neck work less and weaken, so chin pokes out. Results: Upper back pain, neck pain, headache; often referred pain down arms. ==Overview == Indications are that the prevalence of upper back and neck pain has increased dramatically in the decade leading up to 2016.Hoy DG, Protani M, De R, Buchbinder R. epidemiology of neck pain., Best Practice & Research: Clinical rheumatology., 2010 Dec;24(6):783-92Amy Cuddy, Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges, Little, Brown and Company, December 2015: 226\u20138. This increase has been attributed to the corresponding widespread adoption of laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other small portable digital devices. Because their screens do not separate from their keyboards these small devices cannot be set up ergonomically correctly (unless an extra screen or extra keyboard is added). They are unlike personal desk top computers (PCs) in this respect. Most commonly, the user hunches to operate them, often for many hours a day.generation facing a lifetime of back pain., Simply Health., 2 October 2013, Retrieved 13 March 2017 Hunching increases the effective load on the neck up to several times more than does erect posture, due to increasing moment arm.KK Hansraj, of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head.\",Surgery Technology International., Nov 25, 2014:277\u20139 Local pain, cervicogenic headache and referred pain extending down the arms can arise from the sustained muscle strain, cervical facet joint (or apophyseal, or zygapophyseal joint) compression and diminution of the cervical foraminal nerve exits. A hunched posture also sends out a body language message of submission and lower self- confidence, with some research indicating it can actually promote these in the person holding it. A comprehensive view of the research and concepts is found in Amy Cuddy's book Presence (2015). Treatment may include analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilisation, posture instruction and spinal fulcrums. Biomechanical analysis suggests a combination of approaches is best and gives more lasting results. == Signs and symptoms == In a neck with perfect posture (as seen for instance in young children) the head is balanced above the shoulders. In this position the load on each vertebra of the cervical spine is spread evenly between the two facet (apophyseal) joints at the back and the intervertebral disc and vertebral body at the front. The iHunch is characterised by a posture with vagi at the head sitting somewhat forward of the shoulders (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the point of the shoulder (acromion process)). This can be very marked, with the back of the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward. When the patient is asked to look up at the ceiling, the hunched-forward upper thoracic curve does not change as viewed from the side. Rather, the lower cervical spine 'hinges' backward at C5/6/7, a movement pattern known as 'swan- necking'.\"Swan Neck Deformity of the Cervical Spine\",eOrthopod, Retrieved 24 January 2017 This indicates that the upper back vertebrae have frozen in their habitual flexed positions, with the surrounding collagen of the ligaments, joint capsules and fascia shortening to reinforce this hypomobility. (This is the dowager's hump of the elderly of earlier generations, now observable in modern (2016) late teenagers.) Symptoms include overuse muscle pain and fatigue along the back of the neck and reaching down to the mid-back, often starting with the upper trapezius muscle bellies between the shoulders and neck. Cervicogenic headache from the joints and muscle attachments at the top of the neck is common.Bogduk N, Govind J.\"Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.\",Lancet Neurol., 2009Phil Page \"Cervicogenic Headaches: An Evidence-led Approach to Clinical Management\",International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy., Volume 6(3); Sept 2011:254\u2013266 The compressive load on the cervical facet joints predisposes to acute joint locking episodes, with pain and movement loss.Jonas Vangindertael ed. \"Facet Joint Syndrome\",Physiopedia, June 2012 In older patients with already diminished cervical foramina spaces and/or osteophytes, nerve root irritation and impingement can trigger referred pain down the arm(s).Ruth Jackson Classic: The Cervical Syndrome\", Clinical Orthopeadics and Related Research, v.468(7); 2010 Jul: 1739\u20131745 == Causes == The human spine is well suited to erect upright posture, with the increased heart rate from movement shunting a good blood supply to the muscles. This is clearly not the case for vast numbers of sedentary humans spending many hours daily bent over laptops, tablets, smartphones and similar. A biomechanical assessment of thoracic hunching shows the abnormal spinal loading and other effects which plausibly account for the recent steep rise in thoracic and cervical pain in step with the ubiquitous adoption of the small IT devices. The gravity of stress on the spine dramatically increases with thoracic hunching, roughly 10 pounds of weight are added to the cervical spine in weight for every inch of forward head posture by looking down at a small IT device. As a consequence there is growing medical concern specifically with children as their head size is larger in relation to their body and thus pose an increased risk group for being affected by musculoskeletal and neurological issues in the neck caused by thoracic hunching. Hunching has always caused problems, for instance in occupational groups like dentists,\"Trapezius myalgia: making dentistry a pain in the neck \u2014 or head, \"Dental Economics, vol 98, issue 8; 2008 surgeons,Soueid A1, Oudit D, Thiagarajah S, Laitung G. \"The pain of surgery: pain experienced by surgeons while operating.\", International Journal of Surgery, 2009.11.08: ):118\u201320 hairdressers,Mussi G1, Gouveia N \"Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in Brazilian hairdressers.\",Occupational medicine, 2008 Aug;58(5):367-9 nurses,J Smedley, H Inskip, F Trevelyan, P Buckle, C Cooper, D Coggon.factors for incident neck and shoulder pain in hospital nurses\",Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2003;60:864\u2013869 chefs,Haukka, E., Leino-Arjas, P., Solovieva, S. et al. of musculoskeletal pain among female kitchen workers\",International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, November 2006, Volume 80:141\u2013148 teachers,Patience N Erick and Derek R Smith 10.1186/1471-2474-12-260/, \u201cA systematic review of musculoskeletal disorders among school teachers\",BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 17 November 2011 computer workers and students.Niemi SM, Levoska S, Rekola KE, Kein\u00e4nen-Kiukaanniemi SM. and shoulder symptoms of high school students and associated psychosocial factors.\",The Journal of adolescent health, 1997 Mar;20(3):238-42. Some rheumatoid conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease, and connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome cause characteristic excessive thoracic kyphosis. What has changed is the amount of hunching in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young. == Epidemiology == The first laptop was produced in 1981 but it took more than a decade of development for the designs to approach current (2016) levels of portability and capacity, and hence uptake. Apple produced the first smartphone (the iPhone) in 2007 and the first tablet (the iPad) in 2010. In 2015 there were 4.43 billion mobile phone (cellphone) users in the world, of which 2.6 billion had smartphones.Pawel Piejko mobile market statistics you should know in 2016\",Device Atlas, 12 April 2016 In the US, 45% owned a tablet computer in 2014 and 92% owned a mobile phone; for younger adults aged 18\u201329, only 2% didn't own a mobile phone and 50% had tablets.Monica Anderson Device Ownership: 2015\",Pew Research Centre: Internet, Science and Tech., 29 October 2015 A large Finnish cross- sectional study on school-age adolescents published in 2012 concluded that more than two hours a day spent on computers was associated with a moderate/severe increase in musculoskeletal pain.Paula T Hakala, Lea A Saarni, Raija-Leena Punam\u00e4ki, Marjut A Wallenius, Clas-H\u00e5kan Nyg\u00e5rd and Arja H Rimpel\u00e4 symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents \u2013 pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study, BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 22 March 2012: In the following year, the average UK 18\u201324 year- old spent 8.83 hours a day in front of a PC, laptop or tablet. Neck pain per se has been a large problem for a long time, and surveyed repeatedly. A composite review of studies with good methodology by Fejer et al published in 2006 found that point prevalence (in pain right now) of neck pain in the adult (15\u201375 years) population ranged from 5.9% to 22.2%, with one study of the elderly (65+ years) finding 38.7% were in pain when surveyed.Fejer R1, Kyvik KO, Hartvigsen J prevalence of neck pain in the world population: a systematic critical review of the literature.\",European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, 2006 Jun;15(6)):834-48 Generally, more urban populations had more neck pain, e.g. 22.2% of a large 1998 Canadian study had neck pain when surveyed.C\u00f4t\u00e9 P, Cassidy JD, Carroll L. prevalence of neck pain and related disability in Saskatchewan adults\",Spine,1998 Aug 1;23(15):1689\u201398 Based on these surveys of neck pain prevalence, and adding to them the prevalence of thoracic pain and cervicogenic headache, it is reasonable to estimate that around one adult in six (15%) probably has pain in any, some or all of those areas right now.\u201cEvidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain\u201d ,Healing Arts Continuing Education, 2010 However the published epidemiological papers draw on raw data from surveys done at least 10 years ago, and there are indications that the numbers have been rising dramatically since then \u2013 as rapidly as the adoption of laptops, tablets and smartphones. This is reflected in the recent rise in the number of popular articles, news items and media discussions about the problem.addiction creating generation of teenage hunchbacks\u201d,New Zealand Herald, Sunday Oct 18, 2015Alyssa Navarro Your iPhone For Ruining Your Posture And Your Mood\u201d,TECHTIMES, 15 December 2015Stephen August August: the iHunch\u201d,Saturday Morning: Radio New Zealand, 16 November 2013 == Pathogenesis == The iHunch is a multi-factorial problem.\u201cThe iHunch analysed\u201d, Retrieved 24 January 2017 * Thoracic hunching requires flexing of the thoracic facet joints. After sufficient time and load, they can freeze and lock in this position. The collagen of the surrounding ligaments, fascia and joint capsules will shorten down around the immobile joints, reinforcing the hunched hypomobile section of spine. * The middle back support muscles (erector spinae, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak. * The cantilevered (poked forward) head position loads the spine up to several times more than erect posture, because of the increased moment arm.Hansraj KK. of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head\u201d,Surgical Technology International, 2014 Nov;25::277-9 So the posterior neck muscles (especially the upper fibres of trapezius) holding the head in its forward position, often sustained for many hours, can strain, producing individual myofibril and cell damage. Repair of this microtrauma involves the laying down of adhesive fibrosis, as a normal part of the inflammatory response. Adhesive fibrosis is relatively non-elastic, so after sufficient repeated microtrauma from muscle strain, the posterior neck muscles become strained, shortened and less elastic. * In this same cantilevered head position, the longus colli muscles and other deep neck flexors around the front of the neck are hardly being used, so they become weak, allowing the chin to poke out. * The combined effect of all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At the top of the cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with pain referring over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the nuchal line of the occiput.Bogduk N, Govind J.headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.\u201d, The Lancet. Neurology, 2009 Oct;8(10):959-68 In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the intervertebral foramina are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, referring pain some distance down the arm(s). == Treatment == Neck pain generally has been treated with a profusion of approaches and modalities, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; pain relief medications (analgesics) such as acetaminophen; low dose tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline for chronic problems; physical therapy (a.k.a. physiotherapy in British-derived cultures) which utilises a wide range of techniques and modalities; spinal manipulation from osteopaths, manipulating physiotherapists and doctors; massage; muscle strengthening programmes including gyms and Pilates; postural approaches such as the Alexander Technique; stretching approaches such as yoga; ergonomic approaches including setting up desktop computers correctly and frequent breaks; and surgery for severe structural problems such as osteophytic impingement on the cervical nerve roots and cervical disc herniation. A biomechanical analysis of the iHunch indicates its standard, logical development from much flexed activity and its multi-factorial character. (See Pathogenesis above.) A composite approach which covers each component of the problem is therefore likely to be most successful and lasting. Most of the general treatment approaches to neck pain cover only one aspect. A logical response should include as a minimum: * Strengthening, especially of (1) the middle and lower back support muscles and scapula retractors, and (2) the longus colli and the deep neck flexor muscles.\"Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain\" , Healing Arts Continuing Education, 2010 * Stretching muscles that cause neck protrusion, especially of the upper fibres of the trapezius muscle.\"Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain', Healing Arts Continuing Education, 2010 **Lower cervical flexors: sternocleidomastoid, anterior and middle scalene muscles. **Upper cervical (capital) extensors: semispinalis capitis, longissimus capitis, splenius capitis, suboccipital muscles Strengthening muscles that cause neck retraction: **Lower cervical extensors: splenius cervicis, semispinalis cervicis, longissimus cervicis **Upper cervical (capital) flexors: longus capitis, Rectus capitis anterior, Suprahyoid muscles * Massage, to loosen adhesive fibrotic tethering of the posterior neck and upper trapezius muscles. * Unlocking of the hypomobile (frozen) facet joints of the thoracic spine and stretching of the shortened collagen reinforcing the excessive kyphosis (hunch). A sufficiently tight patch of thoracic spine cannot be freed up solely by patient exercises, stretches or movements. This is due to leverage \u2013 with any general exercise, the segments of the spine that are moving well will tend to move more, reducing the leverage on the hypomobile segments. A sufficiently localised external force is then necessary, such as specific hands-on spinal mobilisation or manipulation. A randomized clinical trial by Cleland et al showed manipulation of the thoracic spine reduced neck pain immediately.Cleland JA, Childs JD, McRae M, Palmer JA, Stowell T. effects of thoracic manipulation in patients with neck pain: a randomized clinical trial.\u201d, Manual Therapy, 2005 May;10(2):127-35 * However unless the surrounding shortened collagen also receives sufficient stretching, collagen rebound will tend to freeze up the facet joint again rapidly. Collagen is stronger by weight than steel wire and is best stretched by a sufficiently long, strong, localised, passive stretch.Matthew A Fisher Explained Collagen\u201d, Chemistry Encyclopedia, Retrieved 24 January 2017 In practical terms this may be achieved by the hunched patient lying back on a spinal fulcrum device, which uses the upper body weight to provide the external force, localised over the fulcrum. == References == == External links == * * The iHunch analysed.
