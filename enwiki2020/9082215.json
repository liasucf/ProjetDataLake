    "text": "In mathematics, the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, proved by Boris Tsirelson and Vladimir Sudakov, and later independently by Christer Borell, states that among all sets of given Gaussian measure in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, half-spaces have the minimal Gaussian boundary measure. == Mathematical formulation == Let \\scriptstyle A be a measurable subset of \\scriptstyle\\mathbf{R}^n endowed with the standard Gaussian measure \\gamma^n with the density {\\exp(-\\|x\\|^2/2)}/(2\\pi)^{n/2}. Denote by : A_\\varepsilon = \\left\\\\{ x \\in \\mathbf{R}^n \\, | \\, \\text{dist}(x, A) \\leq \\varepsilon \\right\\\\} the \u03b5-extension of A. Then the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality states that : \\liminf_{\\varepsilon \\to +0} \\varepsilon^{-1} \\left\\\\{ \\gamma^n (A_\\varepsilon) - \\gamma^n(A) \\right\\\\} \\geq \\varphi(\\Phi^{-1}(\\gamma^n(A))), where : \\varphi(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-t^2/2)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\quad{\\rm and}\\quad\\Phi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\varphi(s)\\, ds. == Proofs and generalizations == The original proofs by Sudakov, Tsirelson and Borell were based on Paul L\u00e9vy's spherical isoperimetric inequality. Sergey Bobkov proved a functional generalization of the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, from a certain \"two point analytic inequality\". Bakry and Ledoux gave another proof of Bobkov's functional inequality based on the semigroup techniques which works in a much more abstract setting. Later Barthe and Maurey gave yet another proof using the Brownian motion. The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality also follows from Ehrhard's inequality. == See also == * Concentration of measure * Borell\u2013TIS inequality == References == Category:Probabilistic inequalities ",
