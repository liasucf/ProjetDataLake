Lord Taner campaigned against Russia during World War I and ensured that Russian troops did not access strategic ammunition and weapons stockpiles and maintained Turkish trenches to stop Russian troops from advancing into Turkish territory. Taner was among the first set of representatives who joined the parliament for its first session on April 23, 1920, the day when the Turkish Republic was formed. Lord Taner represented Malatya in Parliament and removed his royal titles once democracy was established. He transferred his position as Lord to the elected Mayor of Hekimhan and distributed his lands to the villagers working the land. He temporarily left the parliament in order to suppress the rebellion in Yozgat which wanted to re-form an Ottoman style government in Turkey. After the rebellion was suppressed and his military duties were over on 27 September 1920 he returned to his home in Hekimhan and was excused from parliamentary duties until February 1921. He spent the following years as a member of parliament, but did not actively participate in parliamentary sessions or take political roles in any commissions. When he left parliament, he returned home to Hekimhan. On July 27, 1925 he passed away.
