Fotbal Club Universitatea Cluj (), commonly known as Universitatea Cluj or simply as U Cluj, is a Romanian professional football club based in the city of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj County. Founded in 1919 by Iuliu Ha\u021bieganu, the team currently plays in the Liga II, the second tier of the Romanian football league system. Universitatea Cluj spent most of their history in the first division, but never became national champions. They played five Romanian Cup finals under four different names, and won the trophy in the 1964\u201365 season. They were considered to be the important in the region of Transylvania, however this status has been threatened in the 21st century by the success of their city rivals CFR Cluj. Universitatea players and fans are nicknamed \u0218epcile ro\u0219ii (\"The Red Caps\"), after the red berets worn by students of the Cluj University of Medicine. The club traditionally plays in white and black kits, although variations of red, maroon and gold have been used in the past. Their home ground is Cluj Arena, which was opened in 2011. ==History== The Universitatea sports club of Cluj was founded in September 1919 by the \"Sports Society of University Students\" (abbreviated to \"U\"). Its first chairman was Professor Iuliu Ha\u021bieganu, a physician and politician. In the early years of its existence \"U\" Cluj played in local competitions; at the time there was no national football championship in Romania. The team played against Chinezul Timi\u0219oara in the 1923 final of the Mara Cup, losing 0\u20132. \"U\" played in the Romanian national football championship Divizia A from 1932. In their first season \"U\" finished first in its group and played the championship final against Ripensia Timi\u0219oara (0\u20130 and 3\u20135). A statue of \"U\" Cluj's 1940s and 1950s captain Mircea Luca is in front of the Cluj Arena stadium. In the first season of the Romanian Cup, in 1933\u201334, \"U\" reached the final, losing against Ripensia Timi\u0219oara (0\u20135). In 1940, \"U\" moved from Cluj to Sibiu as a result of the Second Vienna Award, when the northern part of Transylvania was ceded to Hungary. In 1942, \"U\" played in the final of the Romanian Cup for a second time and lost against Rapid Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20137). In 1945, after the end of the Second World War and the return of the northern part of Transylvania to Romania, \"U\" returned to its home in Cluj. In 1946, the name of the club was changed to \u0218tiin\u021ba Cluj (). In 1949, the team reached the final of the Romanian Cup for the third time, but it was beaten by CSCA Bucure\u0219tinow called Steaua Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20132). At the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, the manager of \u0218tiin\u021ba Cluj was \u0218tefan Kov\u00e1csa famous Romanian coach who later became the manager of Ajax Amsterdam. In 1964\u201365, \u0218tiin\u021ba Cluj won the Romanian Cup; this remained the greatest performance of the club for many years. In 1966, the name of the team was changed back to \"Universitatea\". At the end of the 1971\u20131972 season, \"U\" was in the best position in the Romanian Championship Divizia A after the Second World War; it finished third in the league table, with the same number of points as the second placed team UTA Arad. In 1998, \"U\" reached the final of Cupa Ligii but lost to FCM Bac\u0103u. In 1999, \"U\" was relegated into the second Romanian division, Divizia B and in 2000 it was relegated for the first time in its history into the third division, Divizia C. It played one season in the third division, and in 2001 it was promoted back to Divizia B. The manager of the team at the time was the ex-Romanian international, Ioan Ovidiu Sab\u0103uwho started playing football in the 1980s at \"U\" Cluj. In the 2005\u201306 Divizia B season, the new objective became promotion to the first league. Under coach Leo Grozavu, who often played highly defensive football, the team made many nil draws and the team lost second place (promotion play-off) by a point, though in the last match days they won 4\u20130 with the first place and the third, and 3\u20132 (after leading 3\u20130) with the 2nd place. In the beginning of the 2006\u201307 Liga II season (Divizia B was renamed to Liga II in this season), a new manager, Adrian Falubwho had never coached before but had played over 220 matches for \"U\" Cluj in the first leaguewas hired. Under his lead, the team had a poor early season and only reached 8th position. Yet, the moment passed and the team reached 1st position, often separated by over 6 points from the next position. On 19 May 2007, virtual promotion was achieved after a 0\u20130 draw against second place contender Dacia Mioveni. Three weeks before the final match day, \"U\" ended its 8-year spell in the lower divisions, returning to the first league for the 52nd season in its history. \"U\" Cluj players celebrating the promotion in the Liga I in 2007. 2007\u201308 Liga I season, first season of Liga I in last 8 years for \"U\" Cluj was a tough one, the club didn't manage very well the promotion and at the end of a tumultuous season the club finished on 18th place, the last one, with only 17 points, returning to Liga II.http://www.libertatea.ro/sport/scapa-cine-poate-3-251120 2008\u201309 Liga II season was a transition one and \"U\" saved from relegation to Liga III in the last round, after a 3\u20130 victory against Arie\u0219ul Turda while the main contra- candidate ACU Arad ended only 1\u20131 at home against Bihor Oradea, a match which was followed by a major scandal. Bihor Oradea accused ACU Arad of trying to fix the match, a victory being enough for the team from Arad to save from relegation.http://www.crisana.ro/stiri/sport-7/acu-i-acu-sorin-cigan-si- presedintele-acu-arad-saltati-de-dna-63904.html In the summer of 2009 \"U\" Cluj was taken over by Florian Walter, owner of Romprest Service which is one of the leaders of the facility management sector in Romania.http://ziuadecj.realitatea.net/sport/walter-noul-presedinte-executiv- al-u-cluj--20023.html After only one season under the ownership of Walter, \"U\" Cluj promoted to Liga I finishing 2nd in the 2009\u201310 Liga II season. In the new season, \"U\" Cluj demonstrated that was much better prepared from an administrative and sports point of view and managed to finish 2010\u201311 Liga I season on the 8th place, far away from the relegation area. 2011\u201312 Liga I season brought \"U\" to another area of its existence, well known and valuable players like Mircea Bornescu, George Galamaz, Gabriel Bo\u0219tin\u0103, Marian Cristescu, Ovidiu Hoban, Gheorghe Grozav, Lauren\u021biu Marinescu or Tony were bought by the club and the objective was qualification in the UEFA Europa League. \u0218epcile Ro\u0219ii finished only on 7th place and failed to achieve the objective, but they got the best ranking of the club in the last 26 years. In the summer of 2012, Florian Walter left \"U\" Cluj and becoming the owner of Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti. Together with his departure, most valuable players left also the club and signed with the team from Ploie\u0219ti.http://sptfm.ro/2012/06/03/florian-walter-a-plecat-la-petrolul-dar- inca-mai-ia-jucatori-pentru-clubul-pe-care-nu-l-a-vandut/ Left without the main financier Alb-Negrii attempted to form a squad of competitive players with little money.

In the spring of 2013 Florian Walter announced that he will return at \"U\" Cluj.http://www.digisport.ro/Sport/FOTBAL/Competitii/Liga+1/Florian+Walter+se+intoarce+la+conducerea+lui+U+Cluj At the end of the 2012\u201313 season a new problem shaken the already disturbed environment of \"U\" Cluj.

With all the problems Studen\u021bii managed again to save from relegation, finishing 11th. 2014\u201315 Liga I season was a reorganization one, 6 teams relegated instead of 4, in attempt to reduce Liga I teams from 18 to 14. \"U\" Cluj struggled with its few resources until the very end, but at the end of the season the club was placed on 15th position and relegated to Liga II after its 5-year spell in Liga I. The relegation in the Liga II was a real disaster for \"U\"'s already shaky financial situation. The club made a squad full of young players from the academy hoping that through the ambition of the young players and a miracle the team will promote back in Liga I after only one season of Liga II.http://liga2.prosport.ro/seria-2/pregatiri-amicale/u-cluj- ultima-echipa-din-liga-2-care-a-dat-start-pregatirii-marius-popescu-si-zsolt- szilagyi-sunt-noii-antrenori-cel-mai-in-varsta-jucator-din-lot-are-22-de- ani-14648099 That was the only solution for saving the club, which was at that moment in insolvency for 2 years and a half and with an owner, Florian Walter, present only as a name in the papers, without investing in the club anyway and also being in international tracking for tax evasion and money laundering.http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/justitie/update-comunicat- oficial-politia-romana-florian-walter-este-arestat-in-emiratele-arabe-unite- florian-walter-a-primit-rezidenta-in-dubai-si-nu-mai-poate-fi-extradat-415898 2015\u201316 Liga II season was a season of extremes for \"U\" Cluj.

But after the winter break the financial situation become worse and the team started to have bad results which ended with a qualification in the play-out tournament, without any chances of promotion. This moment was a crucial one, without any motivation the team ended the championship on 10th place and relegated to Liga III.http://www.sport.ro/fotbal-intern/adio-u-universitatea-cluj-a-retrogradat- in-liga-a-treia-dar-are-sanse-mici-sa-joace-acolo-in-sezonul-urmator.html Summer of 2016 it meant a new beginning for \"U\". With a sporting society in insolvency, with big chances of bankruptcy and an owner arrested for tax evasion and money laundering, there was no other solution than the formation of a new club. Cluj-Napoca Municipality which is the owner of \"U\" Cluj logo and record terminated the lease agreement with the company of Florian Walter. Than Cluj-Napoca Municipality together with Babe\u0219-Bolyai University and \"U\" Cluj Supporters Association started a new project entitled ACSF Alb-Negru al Studen\u021bilor Clujeni (ACSF White-Black of the Students from Cluj) a name that was given to the new team, because the society administered by Florian Walter was not yet bankrupt and the name of FC Universitatea Cluj could not belong to two companies. After the foundation of the new team Cluj-Napoca Municipality rented \"U\" logo and record to the new society.http://liga2.prosport.ro/special/oficial-u-cluj-a-iesit-de-sub-aripa- walter-dupa-7-ani-astazi-se-va-naste-noul-club-sustinut-de-primarie-si- universitati-15557672 The team was enrolled in Liga IV-Cluj County, Ioan Ovidiu Sab\u0103u has been named team manager and Marius Popescu the new coach. \u0218epcile Ro\u0219ii also signed with a lot of valuable players like Octavian Abrudan, Alexandru P\u0103curar, Dorin Goga or Gabriel Giurgiu.

On 11 May 2017 was announced officially that from the 2017\u201318 season the team will return to the old name, FC Universitatea Cluj and also the basketball team will evolve under the same brand.http://radiocluj.ro/2017/05/11/fc-universitatea-cluj-1919-o-singura- iubire-pentru-clujeni/http://www.ovidiublag.ro/2017/05/fc-universitatea- cluj-1919-numele-generic-pentru-fotbal-si-baschet/ ==Stadium== The club's home ground is the Cluj Arena, to which it moved in 2011. Ion Moina Stadium, the first football and athletics stadium in Cluj-Napoca, was built between 1908 and 1911 and had a capacity of 1,500. The official inauguration in 1911 was a game between a Cluj team and Galatasaray Istanbul. It was the first game in Europe for Galatasaray; the Cluj team won 8\u20131. In 1961, new U-shaped stands were built and the capacity of the stadium became 28,000. In 2000, most of the stands were declared structurally unsafe for hosting supporters and were closed, leaving the stadium with a capacity of 12\u201313,000.

One of the reasons for the team's popularity is that Cluj- Napoca has some of Romania's most important universitiesincluding the Babes- Bolyai University, the largest in the country with more than 45,000 students. The history of U's fanatic supporters began in the 1970s, when fan-groups started to appear on the stadium. First, in 1972 appeared Amicii U, one of the first supporters groups in Romania. The group started to compose songs along with Music Academy's students and wear accessories like the well-known red hats or pins with the club's crest. Those years, Slav\u0103 \u021bie studen\u021bie was composed, being nowadays club's anthem.https://theplaymaker.ro/suporteri- universitatea-cluj-anii-1970/1150/ After the fall of communist regime, the Ultras idea arrived in Romania. First ultras group founded was Vecchia Guardia in 1996, followed by Ultra Curva Groapa in 1997 and Ultras 19 in 2004. Some of the present-day ultras groups of \"U\" Cluj are: VG (Vecchia Guardia), BOYS, MADS, UCG (Ultra Curva Groapa), FPU (The Few The Proud The Ultras), Fanatics, PPS (Prezenti pentru simbol), Black Devils, Zebras M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur, SAN, F.O.R.T., M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur Clan or Battalogne Gheorgheni. . The fanaticism sometimes led to violence, some violent episode being in 1979 when Sportul Studen\u021besc won the match with \"U\" due to poor referee decisions. After the match, supporters began to shout thieves in front of the stadium and the police started to fight the angry fans. Other episode happened in 2008, when CFR fans went to one of the main squares of the city to celebrate a Dinamo victory over Steaua, that advantage their team to win the league that year. Some Universitatea fans went to the square and had a fight with the rivals before police intervention. ===Rivalries & Friendships=== \"U\" Cluj supporters during a Second Division game against CFR Cluj in 2003. Universitatea have a rivalry with local city team CFR Cluj. The animosity between the teams is one of the oldest in Romanian football. The first incidents between fans of the two sides occurred in the 1920s. A particularly violent episode took place during a derby played in 1924, when the stadium had to be evacuated because of a large-scale fight between supporters. Universitatea won the match 2\u20131. Other episodes of this rivalry are: in 2005, upset by the fact that Universitatea lost a match against UTA Arad, \"U\" fans injured CFR players at the Sport Hotel in Cluj- Napoca; in 2008, following a derby, CFR won and obtained its first league title and Universitatea relegated in Liga II, but this match was preceded by a corruption scandal, because Steaua Bucure\u0219ti's owner, Gigi Becali, offered \"U\" staff one million euros for defeating CFR. Another rivalries are Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, Rapid Bucure\u0219ti and UTA Arad. Universitatea's fans have a good friendship with Dinamo's fans, the main rivals of FCSB and Rapid.
