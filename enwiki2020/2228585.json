It is in the northern part of the Stockholm archipelago in \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Municipality, Stockholm County. It is approximately 65 kilometers north of central Stockholm. With an area of 62.05 km\u00b2, it is the 17th largest island in the country. The island is accessed from the mainland by regular ferries from \u00d6stan\u00e5 as well as by boat from central Stockholm. It has approximately 1,500 permanent residents and 25,000-30,000 residents during the summer season due to the large number of summer houses. ==Administrative history== Ljuster\u00f6 was originally its own municipality until 1967, when it became part of \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Municipality. In 1974, all of \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Municipality became part of Vaxholm Municipality, but since 1983, Ljuster\u00f6 has been part of the new \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Municipality. == Ljuster\u00f6 windfarm project == The present wind turbine on the island Ljuster\u00f6 in 2014 Ljuster\u00f6 is the site of a proposed project to install a large number of wind turbines to generate renewable energy. The project proposes 23 turbines, each with two megawatts electrical power output. Two wind turbines, one 0.8 MW was built in 2006 and one additional with 2 MW has been approved and was installed during 2009, but the other turbines have not yet been approved by the \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Municipality. The project has been heavily criticised by a large number of summer residents as well as permanent residents for affecting the archipelago's environment and views too much, making the island \"look like an industrial power plant\". Several other negative effects has been stated, such as generation of low frequency noise, drop of real estate values etc. ==Photo gallery== File:Ljuster\u00f6_Kyrka_2008.jpg|Ljuster\u00f6 Church.
