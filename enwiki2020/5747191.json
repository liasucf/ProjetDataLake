D\u017euki\u0107, V. D\u017euki\u0107, Brovina, Hatibi, Radovi\u0107, Prekazi and Pindovi\u0107, for Yugoslavia this match it was a pre-preparation before the UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying match against Albania. After the match against Yugoslavia, Kosovo in 1975 participated in the Brotherhood and Unity Tournament, which was held in Pristina and Prizren, where won in all four matches of this tournament against Montenegro (2\u20130), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2\u20131), Slovenia (2\u20130) and Macedonia (1\u20130) and also took first place. =====As part of Yugoslavia national team===== Yugoslav squads at international competitions often included players from Kosovo, such as Fadil Vokrri and Stevan Stojanovi\u0107. Three other footballers from Kosovo, Fahrudin Jusufi, Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107 and Vladimir Durkovi\u0107, were part of the Yugoslav team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics and silver medal at the 1960 European Nations' Cup. ====After breakup of Yugoslavia==== On 20 January 1993, The Football Federation of Kosovo signed a cooperation protocol with the Albanian Football Association and in the framework of this protocol it was decided to play on 14 February a friendly match between Albania and Kosovo, which was the first match of Kosovo following the breakup of Yugoslavia, and this match ended with a 1\u20133 defeat and the starting line-up of that match was Ahmet Beselica, Ardian Kozniku, Bardhec Seferi, Fadil Berisha, Gani Llapashtica, Genc Hoxha, Isa Sadriu, Kushtrim Munishi, Muharrem Sahiti, Sadullah Ajeti and Selajdin Jerliu. ====After Kosovo War==== On 7 September 2002, Kosovo for first time after the Kosovo War played a friendly match against Albania and the match ended with a 0\u20131 home minimal defeat and the starting line-up of that match was Ahmet Beselica, Ardian Kozniku, Arsim Abazi, Besnik Kollari, Fadil Ademi, Faruk Statovci, Ismet Munishi, Mehmet Dragusha, Sunaj Keqi, Xhevdet Llumnica and Zenun Selimi.

It was the first time that Kosovo played against a team that has taken part in the FIFA World Cup and the winning goal was scored by Kristian Nushi from the penalty kick on the 84th minute. On 22 April 2006, Kosovo achieved their biggest win, defeating Monaco 7\u20131. If one included matches played before Kosovo became a FIFA member, this scoreline is their best result yet. ===After independence=== ====First match==== On 17 February 2010, for the first time since the declaration of independence Kosovo played a friendly match against Albania and the match ended with a 2\u20133 home defeat. The starting line-up of that match was Anel Rashkaj, Dukagjin Gashi, Enis Zab\u00ebrgja, Fisnik Papu\u00e7i, Ilir Nallbani, Kushtrim Mushica, Liridon Kukaj, Robert Gjeraj, Shp\u00ebtim Hasani and Yll Hoxha. This match had a charity character as the profits gathered from this meeting went to those affected by floods in Shkod\u00ebr. ====Efforts for internationalization==== On 6 May 2008, after the declaration of independence from Serbia, Kosovo applied for FIFA membership. On 24 October 2008, Kosovo's application was discussed at the FIFA Congress in Z\u00fcrich, when Kosovo was rejected membership in FIFA and could not play friendly matches as it was deemed it did not comply with article 10 of the FIFA statutes, that only \"an independent state recognised by the international community\" may be admitted into FIFA. On 22 May 2012. FIFA reversed that decision stating that Kosovo may play other countries in international friendlies according to Article 79 of the FIFA Statutes. In September 2012, Albania international Lorik Cana, along with Swiss internationals Granit Xhaka, Valon Behrami and Xherdan Shaqiri, all of them with Kosovo Albanian origin, wrote a declaration to FIFA President Sepp Blatter, asking him to allow the Kosovo national team to be allowed to play friendly matches. The declaration was also signed by eight other Albanian footballers, hailing from Kosovo as Ahmed Januzi, Alban Meha, Armend Dallku, Burim Kukeli, Etrit Berisha, Fatmire Bajramaj, Lorik Cana, M\u00ebrgim Mavraj and Samir Ujkani. In May 2012. In a meeting held, FIFA decided to allow friendly matches to be played a decision it later revoked following a protest issued by Football Association of Serbia. Some players, especially Kosovo Serbs as Milan Bi\u0161evac and Milo\u0161 Krasi\u0107, continued to play for the Serbia. A new meeting was held at FIFA, on 27 and 28 September in which the Kosovo issue was again planned to be discussed, which was then postponed until December. =====Permitting by FIFA to play friendlies===== On 13 January 2014, the national team was given permission by FIFA to play against FIFA member associations in international friendlies, with the notable exception of representative teams of countries of the former Yugoslavia. Even club teams would be allowed to play friendlies after a FIFA Emergency Committee meeting. However, it was stipulated that clubs and representative teams of the Football Federation of Kosovo may not display national symbols as flags, emblems, etc. or play national anthems. The go-ahead was given after meetings between the Football Association of Serbia and Sepp Blatter. On 6 February 2013, FIFA gave the permission to play international friendly games against other member associations. On 5 March 2014, following FIFA's ruling. Kosovo played its first international friendly against Haiti and the match ended in a 0\u20130 draw. Before the match, some players of Kosovo posed with guns at a shooting range, causing a stir in Serbia. On the eve of the match, supporters of Kosovo burned the flag of Serbia. This incident prompted the Football Association of Serbia to request that FIFA revoke Kosovo's right to play international friendlies. After the match against Haiti, five more games were held with Turkey, Senegal, Oman, Equatorial Guinea and in the end with Albania. The first win in these friendlies was against Oman with a 1\u20130 home minimal win, while the biggest defeat that was simultaneously also the first defeat was a 1\u20136 home defeat against Turkey that was playing with players that were the majority from Turkish championship. ====Membership in UEFA and FIFA==== In September 2015 at an UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Malta was approved the request from the federation to the admission in UEFA to the next Ordinary Congress to be held in Budapest. On 3 May 2016, at the Ordinary Congress. Kosovo were accepted into UEFA after members voted 28\u201324 in favor of Kosovo. On 13 May 2016, Kosovo was accepted in FIFA during their 66th congress in Mexico with 141 votes in favour and 23 against. ===First tournament=== ====Debut in World Cup qualification and nearly successful first Euro attempt==== Kosovo began to make their debut in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, where Kosovo was drawn with Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Turkey and Ukraine. The Kosovars created its first major surprise, holding host Finland to a 1\u20131 draw, but it turned to be the lone point of Kosovo in the qualification, as the team lost the remaining games and finished last. Following the failure to qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup, Kosovo participated in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League D sharing group with Azerbaijan, Faroe Islands and Malta, where the Kosovars topped their group undefeated to reach the country's first-ever playoffs in its attempt to qualify for UEFA Euro 2020. After the successful Nations League, Kosovo entered the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, where they shared group A with Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Montenegro and 2018 World Cup fourth place finisher England. As the dark horse of the qualification, Kosovo however created a major phenomenon, managed to beat Bulgaria, Montenegro and especially, a shock home win over the Czechs to take the second place behind England. The game against England away even saw the Kosovars took an early lead in the surprise, even though they were unable to protect it and fell 3\u20135 away. In the decisive match against the Czechs away, which Kosovo needed a win to directly qualify for the first time, Kosovo gained a shock lead, but failed to protect it again as they lost 1\u20132 and could only participate in the playoff,{ but this remained to be Kosovo's greatest success up to date. ====Setback==== After successfully obtained a playoff position, Kosovo headed to the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League C, being drawn with Greece, Moldova and Slovenia. After impressive performance in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, Kosovo was tipped favorably to promote to League B. Yet, Kosovo began the Nations League with a disappointing 1\u20131 away draw to Moldova, before the team which was halved due to the absences of key players suffered a 1\u20132 home loss against Greece. In Kosovo's first ever competitive UEFA Euro play-offs, Kosovo was drawn against North Macedonia. However, Kosovo was eliminated after losing 1\u20132 to the North Macedonians in Skopje. ===FIFA ranking history=== Best Ranking Worst Ranking Best Mover Worst Mover {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Rank !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !rowspan=\"2\"| !rowspan=\"2\"| !rowspan=\"2\"| !rowspan=\"2\"| !rowspan=\"2\"| !colspan=\"2\"|Ranking !colspan=\"2\"|Move |- !Best !Worst !Best (+) !Worst (\u2212) |- | |115 |2020 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- | |114 |2019 |114 |130 |6 (June) |1 (November) |- | |131 |2018 |131 |178 |24 (August) |1 (January) |- | |177 |2017 |164 |184 |9 (November) |6 (April) |- | |165 |2016 |164 |190 |22 (September) |190 (July) |} ==Competitive record== ===FIFA World Cup=== On 9 June 2016, the UEFA Emergency Panel decided that Kosovo would join Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Turkey and Ukraine in the Group I; and also decided that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia should not play against Kosovo for security reasons.
