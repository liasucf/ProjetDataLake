He is known for translating Western classics into Turkish in the 1940s, including those of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov and Moli\u00e8re. He was deported from Turkey in the 1950s due to an article that he wrote about the Soviet Union and emigrated to Israel in 1956, where he lived until his death in 2009. ==Biography== G\u00fcney was born Misha Rottenberg in Odessa, to a Ukrainian Jewish family. His family emigrated to Turkey following the October Revolution in 1917. He graduated from St. Joseph High School and studied philosophy at Istanbul University. During this time, he acquired Turkish citizenship and changed his name to Erol G\u00fcney. In the 1940s, he joined a translation bureau led by then-Minister of Education Hasan \u00c2li Y\u00fccel and Sabahattin Ali. G\u00fcney, who was fluent in Turkish, Russian, English, and French, translated various works of Western literature, including Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and Gogol's The Government Inspector. During his time at the translation bureau, he befriended important figures of Turkish literature, including Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu, Azra Erhat, Cahit K\u00fclebi, Orhan Veli Kan\u0131k, Necati Cumal\u0131, and Melih Cevdet Anday. Following the demise of Turkey's single party period and Hasan \u00c2li Y\u00fccel's resignation, the translation bureau lost its function and G\u00fcney left it to focus on journalism. He began working for Agence France-Presse. In 1955, he was exiled to Yozgat due to an article he wrote about the Soviet Union. Later, his Turkish citizenship was revoked and he was deported to France. In 1956, he emigrated to Israel and settled in Tel Aviv. G\u00fcney continued to work as a journalist in Israel. He also started writing for the Istanbul-based Jewish newspaper \u015ealom. He became Yedioth Ahronoth's Washington, D.C. correspondent in the 1980s. He was blacklisted from entering Turkey until 1990; he frequently visited Istanbul afterwards. G\u00fcney was married to Dora G\u00fcney, who emigrated to Israel with him. Both were close friends of poet Orhan Veli Kan\u0131k, who dedicated a well-known poem cycle to G\u00fcney and his cat, Edibe. He also had a daughter, Eleanore, from a Parisian woman. G\u00fcney died in Tel Aviv in 2009. ==Works about G\u00fcney== * *Ya\u015fam\u0131n S\u00fcr\u00fckledi\u011fi Yerde- Erol G\u00fcney\u2019in Ya\u015fam \u00d6yk\u00fcs\u00fc, a documentary by Sabiha B\u00e2nu Yalkut-Breddermann ==References== ==External links== * Erol G\u00fcney's obituary at \u015ealom Category:1914 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Turkish journalists Category:Turkish translators Category:Israeli translators Category:Israeli journalists Category:Ukrainian emigrants to Israel Category:Turkish emigrants to Israel Category:Odessa Jews Category:Writers from Istanbul Category:Translators to Turkish Category:Translators from French Category:Translators from Russian Category:Yedioth Ahronoth Category:Turkish expatriates in France Category:Israeli expatriates in the United States Category:People from Tel Aviv Category:Istanbul University alumni Category:People deported from Turkey Category:Agence France-Presse journalists Category:Reporters and correspondents Category:Jewish Ukrainian writers Category:20th-century translators Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Turkey Category:St. Joseph High School Istanbul alumni Category:20th-century journalists ",
