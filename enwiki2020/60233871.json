    "text": "This list of Atlantic Coast Conference business schools outlines the business schools hosted by the 15 universities of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). All 15 members of the ACC host business schools, and two, the University of Virginia and the University of Pittsburgh, have separate schools or colleges for their graduate and undergraduate business programs. Although originally founded as an athletic conference, members of the ACC participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Consortium (ACCAC) which provides a vehicle for inter-institutional academic and administrative collaboration between member universities. Programs of the ACCAC include research conferences, faculty and student leadership programs, and the ACC Inventure Prize, a Shark Tank-like innovation competition for teams of students from ACC universities who are judged on quality of idea, business model, entrepreneurship, and probability of success. U.S. News & World Report ranks Duke University's Fuqua School of Business as best in the ACC at number ten in the nation for its MBA program and sixth in the nation for its Executive MBA program, while the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan\u2013Flagler Business School ranks first in the nation for on-line MBA programs. The University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tie for the top undergraduate business programs in the conference, both at number seven nationally, according to US News. The first business program founded at an ACC member university was at the University of Pittsburgh which can trace its business programs back to 1907 when it initiated business education in its former Evening School of Economics, Accounts, and Finance. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:70%\" |- ! style=\"width:30%;\"| School name ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Host institution ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Location ! style=\"width:10%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Main facility ! style=\"width:*;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Degree programs offered ! style=\"width:5%;\"| 2019 US News MBA ranking ! style=\"width:5%;\"| 2018 US News undergrad ranking ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year founded |- |Carroll School of Management |Boston College |Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Fulton Hall |BS, MBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|24 |1938 |- |Clemson College of Business |Clemson University |Clemson, South Carolina |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Sirrine Hall |BS, MAcc, MBA |style=\"text-align:center;\"|79 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|78 |1933 |- |Darden School of Business (graduate) |University of Virginia |Charlottesville, Virginia |style=\"text- align:center;\"|125px Saunders Hall |MBA/EMBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|n/a |1955 |- |Florida State College of Business |Florida State University |Tallahassee, Florida |style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rovetta Building |BS, MAcc, MBA, MS |style=\"text-align:center;\"|79 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|45 |1950 |- |Fuqua School of Business |Duke University |Durham, North Carolina |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Breeden Hall |MBA/EMBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|n/a |1969 |- |Katz Graduate School of Business (graduate) |University of Pittsburgh |Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |style=\"text- align:center;\"|125px Mervis Hall |MBA/EMBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|n/a |1960 |- |Kenan\u2013Flagler Business School |University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |Chapel Hill, North Carolina |style=\"text- align:center;\"|125px McColl Building |BA, MBA/EMBA, MAcc, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |1919 |- |Louisville College of Business |University of Louisville |Louisville, Kentucky |style=\"text- align:center;\"|125px Frazier Hall |BS, MBA/EMBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|87 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|108 |1953 |- |McIntire School of Commerce (undergraduate) |University of Virginia |Charlottesville, Virginia |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Rouss Hall |BS |style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a |style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |1921 |- |Mendoza College of Business |University of Notre Dame |Notre Dame, Indiana |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Mendoza buildings |BA, MBA/EMBA, MS |style=\"text-align:center;\"|26 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |1921 |- |Miami Business School |University of Miami |Coral Gables, Florida |style=\"text-align:center;\"|Aresty Building |BS, MBA, eMBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|unranked |style=\"text- align:center;\"|64 |1929 |- |Pamplin College of Business |Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |Blacksburg, Virginia |style=\"text- align:center;\"|125px Pamplin Hall |BS, MBA/EMBA, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|unranked |style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |1965 |- |Pitt College of Business Administration |University of Pittsburgh |Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Sennott Square |BS |style=\"text-align:center;\"|n/a |style=\"text- align:center;\"|31 |1907 |- |Poole College of Management |North Carolina State University |Raleigh, North Carolina |style=\"text-align:center;\"|Nelson Hall |BA, MBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|85 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|91 |1992 |- |Scheller College of Business |Georgia Institute of Technology |Atlanta, Georgia |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Business Building |BS, MBA, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|31 |1912 |- |Wake Forest School of Business |Wake Forest University |Winston-Salem, North Carolina |style=\"text-align:center;\"|Farrell Hall |BS, MBA, MS |style=\"text-align:center;\"|unranked |style=\"text- align:center;\"|40 |1969 |- |Whitman School of Management |Syracuse University |Syracuse, New York |style=\"text-align:center;\"|125px Whitman building |BS, MBA, MS, PhD |style=\"text-align:center;\"|89 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|42 |1919 |} ==See also== *List of business schools in the United States *List of United States graduate business school rankings ==References== ==External links== * ACC Academic Consortium ACC ACC Category:Atlantic Coast Conference ",
