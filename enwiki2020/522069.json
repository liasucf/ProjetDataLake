    "text": "The sulfonate ion. A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO3\u2212, where R is an organic group. Sulfonates are the conjugate base of sulfonic acids. Sulfonates are generally stable in water, non-oxidizing, and colorless. Many useful compounds and even some biochemicals feature sulfonates. ==Sulfonate salts== Alkylbenzene sulfonates are detergents found in shampoos, toothpaste laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, etc. Anions with the general formula RSO3\u2212 are called sulfonates. They are the conjugate bases of sulfonic acids with formula RSO2OH. As sulfonic acids tend to be strong acids, the corresponding sulfonates are weak bases. Due to the stability of sulfonate anions, the cations of sulfonate salts such as scandium triflate have application as Lewis acids. A classic organic reaction for the preparation of sulfonates is that of alkyl halides with sulfites such as sodium sulfite, first described by Adolph Strecker in 1868 (Strecker sulfite alkylation).Ueber eine neue Bildungsweise und die Constitution der Sulfos\u00e4uren Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie Volume 148, Issue 1, Pages 90 - 96 (p 90-96) 1868 The general reaction is: ::RX + M2SO3 \u2192 RSO3M + MX Iodide is used as a catalyst. Water-softening usually involves removal of calcium ions in water using a sulfonated ion-exchange resin. ==Sulfonic esters== Esters with the general formula R1SO2OR2 are called sulfonic esters. Individual members of the category are named analogously to how ordinary carboxyl esters are named. For example, if the R2 group is a methyl group and the R1 group is a trifluoromethyl group, the resulting compound is methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate. Sulfonic esters are used as reagents in organic synthesis, chiefly because the RSO3\u2212 group is a good leaving group, especially when R is electron-withdrawing. Methyl triflate, for example, is a strong methylating reagent. Sulfonates are commonly used to confer water solubility to protein crosslinkers such as N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS), BS3, Sulfo-SMCC, etc. ===Sultones=== Propane-1,3-sultone Cyclic sulfonic esters are called sultones.R. J. Cremlyn \u201cAn Introduction to Organosulfur Chemistry\u201d John Wiley and Sons: Chichester (1996) One example is propane-1,3-sultone. Some sultones are short-lived intermediates, used as strong alkylating agents to introduce a negatively charged sulfonate group. In the presence of water, they slowly hydrolyze to the hydroxy sulfonic acids. Sultone oximes are key intermediates in the synthesis of the anti-convulsant drug zonisamide. Tisocromide is an example of a sultone. ==Examples== *Mesylate (methanesulfonate), CH3SO3\u2212 *Triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonate), CF3SO3\u2212 *Ethanesulfonate (esilate, esylate), C2H5SO3\u2212 *Tosylate (p-toluenesulfonate), CH3C6H4SO3\u2212 *Benzenesulfonic acid (besylate), C6H5SO3\u2212 *Closilate (closylate, chlorobenzenesulfonate), ClC6H4SO3\u2212 *Camphorsulfonate (camsilate, camsylate), (C10H15O)SO3\u2212 *Pipsylate (p-iodobenzenesulfonate derivative). *Nosylate ==See also== *Sulfate *Sulfoxide *Sulfonyl ==References== Category:Functional groups Category:Leaving groups ",
