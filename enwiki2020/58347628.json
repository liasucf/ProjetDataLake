    "text": "The 1916 Santa Clara Broncos football team represented Santa Clara University during the 1916 college football season. In their first and only season under head coach Charlie Austin, the team compiled a 10\u20130 record, shut out seven of its opponents, and outscored all opponents by a total of 318 to 13. In keeping with West Coast practice during the 1910s, the team played principally under rugby rules rather than American football rules. The season ended on November 11 with a match between undefeated Santa Clara and undefeated Stanford; Santa Clara won convincingly by a 28\u20135 score at Ewing Field in San Francisco. ==Schedule== ==References== Santa Clara Category:Santa Clara Broncos football seasons Category:College football undefeated seasons Santa Clara Missionites football ",
