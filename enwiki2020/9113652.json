However, due to its ongoing tensions with Israel as part of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the scope of Palestine's diplomatic network has been relatively limited in the western/western-aligned world, with many of these countries permitting only sub-diplomatic relations with lower than embassy status- missions. ==Africa== * ** Algiers (Embassy) * ** Luanda (Embassy) * ** Brazzaville (Embassy) * ** Djibouti City (Embassy) * ** Cairo (Embassy) * ** Addis Ababa (Embassy) * ** Libreville (Embassy) * ** Accra (Embassy) * ** Conakry (Embassy) * ** Bissau (Embassy) * ** Abidjan (Embassy) * ** Tripoli (Embassy) * ** Bamako (Embassy) * ** Nouakchott (Embassy) * ** Rabat (Embassy) * ** Maputo (Embassy) * ** Windhoek (Embassy)Palestine Embassies, Missions, Delegations , Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations.
