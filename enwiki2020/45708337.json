In addition Dumbarton played in the Dumbartonshire Cup. ==Scottish League== Dumbarton's sixth consecutive season in the Second Division, while certainly an improvement on the previous season, was unremarkable in most respects. A run of six league defeats at the beginning of 1928 brought the threat of relegation, but 5 wins from 6 games at the end of the season lifted the team to an 11th place out of 20 with 36 points - 18 behind champions Ayr United. ==Scottish Cup== Dumbarton were knocked out in the first round by Hamilton. ==Dumbartonshire Cup== Dumbarton were runners-up in the Dumbartonshire Cup for the fourth season running, losing out to Clydebank in the final. ==Player statistics== |} Source: ===Transfers=== ==== Players in ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !From !Date |- | James Laing | Vale of Leven | 9 Jul 1927 |- | James Miller | East Fife | 13 Jul 1927 |- | John Pesrson | Ayr United | 18 Jul 1927 |- | Alfred Aitchison | Benburb | 8 Aug 1927 |- | James Crawford | Vale of Leven | 8 Aug 1927 |- | Archibald McLardie | Vale of Leven | 8 Aug 1927 |- | Thomas Lamont | Renton Thistle | 10 Aug 1927 |- | William Kirk | Arthurlie | 11 Aug 1927 |- | Angus Urquhart | Dykehead | 18 Aug 1927 |- | Donald MacPhail | Dumbarton Academy FP | 27 Aug 1927 |- | Daniel Muir | St Bernards | 31 Aug 1927 |- | Archibald Gillies | St Mirren | 4 Oct 1927 |- | Robert Shaw | Alloa Athletic | 14 Oct 1927 |- | John Bradford | St Mirren | 18 Jan 1928 |- | Andrew Hamill | Albion Rovers | 8 Apr 1928 |} ==== Players out ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !To !Date |- | Archibald Muir | Third Lanark | 17 May 1927 |- | Martin Davin | Bury | 19 Aug 1927 |- | Duncan Yuill | Rangers | 17 Jan 1928 |- | John Cameron | Huddersfield Town | |- | John Granger | Ards | |- | James Reid | Vale of Leven | |- | John Swan | Nairn County | |- | Adam Swanson | Dumbarton Athletic | |} In addition Alfred Aitchison, John Black, robert Dennett, George Greenshields and Robert Main all played their last games in Dumbarton 'colours'.
