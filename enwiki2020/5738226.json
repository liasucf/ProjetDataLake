The character was created in 1956 by the Israeli cartoonist Kariel Gardosh, known by his pen name Dosh. The cartoon appeared for many years in the newspaper Maariv. Yosef Lapid, Dosh's colleague on the editorial board of Maariv, described Srulik as an icon of Israel in the same way that Marianne and Uncle Sam were respectively icons of France and the United States. Srulik is a common nickname for \"Yisrael\" (Israel). Srulik has been compared to Handala, the Palestinian national personification.Gil Stern Stern Zohar, Guest Columnist: Srulik, meet Handala: Introducing the two iconic cartoons, known respectively by Israelis and Palestinians yet unknown to each other, is not a bad way to begin, January 7, 2011, Jerusalem Post ==Description== Srulik is generally depicted as a young man wearing a tembel hat, Biblical sandals, and khaki shorts. Srulik is a pioneering Zionist, a lover of the land of Israel and its soil, a dedicated farmer who in time of need puts on a uniform and goes out to defend the state of Israel. Dosh drew Srulik in cartoons on current events for Maariv, and also for various \"specials\" and occasions of the young state. During wartime, Srulik put on a uniform and was drafted to raise the national morale. ==Symbolism== Many have pointed out Srulik's function as an antithesis of the antisemitic caricatures which appeared in Der St\u00fcrmer and other European and Arab journals. As against the stereotype of the weak or cunning Jew that was propagated by Joseph Goebbels, Dosh \u2014 a Holocaust survivor \u2014 drew a proud, strong and sympathetic Jewish character.
