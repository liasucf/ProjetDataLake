Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow notes \"Peruvian Blue has more than its share of variety. Kenny Barron is heard on piano, electric piano, and clavinet on various tracks ... This is an LP that rewards repeated listenings\" On All About Jazz, Douglas Payne said \"Peruvian Blue has much to offer casual jazz listeners and \"Two Areas,\" \"The Procession\" and \"Blue Monk,\" especially, provide required listening for fans of both Kenny Barron and Ted Dunbar. But it would have been more satisfying to hear any one of these different groupings tackle the whole program, rather than having each get sectioned off for a performance or two. Still, Kenny Barron \u2013 who has recorded nearly dozen times as a leader since the early 80s \u2013 always makes music worth hearing. Peruvian Blue is no exception\".Payne, D., All About Jazz Review, accessed January 9, 2017 == Track listing == All compositions by Kenny Barron except where noted. # \"Peruvian Blue\" \u2013 9:53 # \"Blue Monk\" (Thelonious Monk) \u2013 8:41 # \"The Procession\" \u2013 4:51 # \"Two Areas\" \u2013 5:36 # \"Here's That Rainy Day\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Johnny Burke) \u2013 8:07 # \"In the Meantime\" \u2013 5:46 == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano, clavinet, electric piano *Ted Dunbar \u2013 guitar (tracks 1, 2, 4 & 6) *David Williams \u2013 bass, electric bass (tracks 1, 3, 4 & 6) *Albert Heath \u2013 drums(tracks 1, 3, 4 & 6) *Richard Landrum \u2013 congas, percussion (tracks 1, 4 & 6) *Sonny Morgan \u2013 percussion (tracks 1, 4 & 6) == References == Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1974 albums Category:Muse Records albums Category:Albums produced by Don Schlitten ",
