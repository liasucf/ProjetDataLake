    "text": "Mario Grigorov is a Bulgarian composer for film and television and a concert pianist. He performs on the piano and improvises in the styles of jazz, classical and world music. Mario Grigorov's father was a concert trumpeter and his mother a concert pianist. In 1968, the Sofia Conservatorium suspended its age requirement of seven years of age to allow a 5-year-old Grigorov to begin his classical studies. In 1969, Mario\u2019s father took the opportunity to play in the Shah\u2019s handpicked orchestra, and the family relocated for 6 years. Mario\u2019s tutelage in classical piano continued, and he was exposed to the sounds of the new culture he found himself surrounded by. In 1976, again for Mr. Grigorov\u2019s symphony career, the family relocated, this time to East Germany. While finishing out the 1970s with a classical regimen, Grigorov and family moved to Vienna where Mario studied under renowned 20th century composer Thomas Christian David at the Vienna Conservatorium. In the early 1980s Mario moved to Sydney, Australia where he took classes in electronic music and Jazz studies with Don Burrows. He worked with many Australian rock groups. He has lived in Iran, Austria, Autralia, Bulgaria, Germany and USA, now resides between Berlin and London. == Career == Grigorov began composing for television, commercials and film in Sydney, Australia. In 1992, Miles Goodman, a film composer helped Mario relocate to the United States.http://www.public- republic.net/artist-of-the-week-mario-grigorov/ Three days after Grigorov's move to Los Angeles an A&R; executive from Warner Brothers Records, Bob James, heard him improvising in a music store and signed him to his first major-label recording contract. Grigorov then recorded his debut album Rhymes with Orange. Grigorov toured the album at Europe and North America supporting musicians such as Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Charlie Haden and B\u00e9la Fleck. His second album, Aria, a collaboration with Paul Schwartz, was released on 14 October 1997 by Astor Place Records. Aria was a darker crossover with funk along with operatic themes from Carmen, The Magic Flute, Madame Butterfly and Dido and Aeneas. The album reached No. 4 on Billboard\u2019s Top Classical Crossover chart. In 2000, Grigorov began composing music for screen in United States. He is most recognized for his musical scores on films by director Lee Daniels. They worked together on Shadowboxer (2005), Tennessee (2008), Precious (2009) and The Paperboy (2012).
