She was the first holder of the Mexican National Women's Championship to be sanctioned by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission when women's wrestling was allowed in Mexico City after a 30-year ban. She initially retired in 1988 because she was pregnant, but returned in the early 1990s after the death of her husband. Over the years she worked primarily for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) and later on for AAA. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre' :*Mexican National Women's Championship (1 time == Luchas de Apuestas record == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100% style=\"text-align: center\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Winner (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Loser (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Location !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Event !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=15% scope=\"col\"|Date !class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=5% scope=\"col\"|Notes |- |Reyna Gallegos (hair) || La Emurai (hair)|| Puebla, Puebla || N/A|| 1981 || |} ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican female professional wrestlers ",
