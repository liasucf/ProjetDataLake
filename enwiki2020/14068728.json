    "text": "Spittals Interchange is the roundabout on the junction between the A14 and A141 north of Huntingdon, England. The junction is unusual in that three arms of this four-way junction are numbered A14. The \"extra\" A14 route exits to the north and is a four-mile spur that joins the northbound A1. The north-east A14 passes under the roundabout, but the west-east A14 traffic, which is the majority, must enter the roundabout. Traffic lights were added in 2006 in an attempt to reduce the number of accidents and improve traffic flow. The word spital or spittal in this context itself derives from 'hospital', in the sense of hospitality or shelter, as almshouses were originally known. In this case the 'spital' in question is St Margaret's Hospital, which owned land to the north of Huntingdon in medieval times. In addition until the 20th century there were almshouses called The Spitals situated on Ermine Street where the present A141 now crosses it.Ordnance Survey County Series: Huntingdonshire. 1892 ==References== Category:Road junctions in England Category:Transport in Cambridgeshire ",
