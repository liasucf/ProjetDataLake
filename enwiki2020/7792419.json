    "text": "Leptis or Lepcis Parva was a Phoenician colony and Carthaginian and Roman port on Africa's Mediterranean coast, just south of the modern city of Monastir, Tunisia. In antiquity, it was one of the wealthiest cities in the region.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. II, pp. 161, 162 (\"Leptis\"). ==Name== The Punic name of the settlement was written () or (),Edward Lipi\u0144ski, Itineraria Phoenicia (2004), p. 345.Brogan, Wilson, \"Lepcis\" in: The Oxford Classical Dictionary (4th ed. 2012), p. 821. signifying either a new \"construction\" or a \"naval station\". Phoenician colonies often duplicated their names, as with the two \"New Towns\" distinguished in English as Carthage and Cartagena. This name was hellenized L\u00e9ptis (). Under the Romans, the Punic name was Latinized as Lepcis or Leptis. It was known variously as , ', or Leptiminus', all meaning \"Lesser Leptis\" to distinguish it from the \"Greater Leptis\" in what is now Libya. ==Geography== Leptis was located on the Gulf of Hammamet, the classical Gulf of Neapolis (), between Hadrumetum and Thapsus. It was located in the fertile coastal district of Emporia, in the region of Byzacium, the later Roman province of Byzacena.Pliny the Elder, v. 4. s. 3.Pomponius Mela, i. 7. \u00a7 2. ==History== ===Phoenician colony=== Leptis was established as a Tyrian colony, probably originally as a waypost on the trade route between Phoenicia and the Strait of Gibraltar. It appears in the periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, written in the middle or latter part of the fourth centuryBC, as one of the cities in the country of the legendary lotus-eaters.Pseudo-Scylax, Periplus, 110. ===Carthaginian town=== Like other Phoenician colonies, Leptis came to pay tribute to Carthage.Sallust, Bellum Jugurthinum, 19. After the First Punic War, Leptis was at the center of the Mercenary War, a revolt of the Carthaginian mercenaries led by Mathos. This was suppressed with difficulty through the co\u00f6peration of Hamilcar Barca and Hanno the Great in 238BC.Polybius, i. 87. Leptis recovered from the damage and, at the time of the Second Punic War, was one of the wealthiest cities of Emporia. Its tribute to Carthage was equivalent to one Attic talent ( of fairly pure silver) per day.Livy, xxxiv. 62. It was at Leptis that Hannibal's army disembarked on their return to Africa in 203BC.Livy, xxx. 25. In the following year, Leptis was one of few cities under Roman control in north Africa, the rest of Africa still remaining under the control of the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal.Appian, Bella Punica, xiii. 94. Following the conclusion of the war in 201BC, Emporia was overrun by Masinissa, who claimed the district by ancient right. The Carthaginians appealed to Rome for adjudication of the matter, as they were obliged to do by the treaty ending the war. The Roman Senate appointed a commission to look into the matter, including Scipio Africanus, the general credited with Carthage's recent defeat. Although Scipio was uniquely positioned to resolve the dispute, the commission left the rightful possession of Emporia undecided and Masinissa was able to organize much of the territory into the kingdom of Numidia. Leptis itself, however, remained unconquered. ===Roman city=== The region around Leptis came under direct Roman rule following the Third Punic War in 146BC. In Roman times, Leptis was a free city () with its own autonomous government. Local coins were minted with Greek legends (viz. ); later coins with Latin inscriptions may show its elevation to colony (') status or may have originated in Leptis Magna. The possession of Leptis became an important matter during Caesar's Civil War. In 49BC, Juba I of Numidia was at war with the Leptitani when the war was first carried over into Africa. Juba had long been an ally of Pompey and opposed to Caesar. Caesar's lieutenant Gaius Scribonius Curio deemed it safe to attack Utica, as Juba had left his own lieutenant Sabura in charge of the surrounding countryside. Curio routed a Numidian force with a night-time cavalry raid, but rashly engaged Sabura's main force and was annihilated at the Bagradas as Juba approached from Leptis with reinforcements.Caesar, De Bello Civili, ii. 37\u201344. At the beginning of January 46BC, Caesar arrived at Leptis and received a deputation from the city offering its submission. Caesar placed guards on the city gates to prevent his soldiers from entering the city or harassing its people and sent his cavalry back to their ships to protect the countryside, although the latter were ambushed by a Numidian force. Shortly afterward, Caesar moved his camp to Ruspina, leaving six cohorts at Leptis under the command of Gaius Hostilius Saserna.Hirtius, De Bello Africo, 6, 7, 9, 10. During the winter and spring of 46, Leptis was one of Caesar's primary bases and a source of provisions. A cavalry troop sent to Leptis for provisions intercepted a force of Numidian and Gaetulian soldiers, whom they took prisoner after a brief skirmish. Part of Caesar's fleet was anchored off Leptis, where they were taken unawares by Publius Attius Varus, one of Pompey's admirals, who burned Caesar's transports and captured two undefended quinqueremes. Learning of the attack, Caesar rode to Leptis and went in pursuit of Varus with his remaining ships, recapturing one of the quinqueremes along with a trireme. At Hadrumetum, he burned a number of Pompey's transports and captured or put to flight a number of galleys.Hirtius, De Bello Africo, 61\u201364. Leptis continued to flourish under the empire before Byzacena was ceded to the Vandals in AD442. The city was retaken by the Byzantine general Belisarius in 533, during the Vandalic War. It then formed part of the Praetorian Prefecture of Africa and later part of the Exarchate of Africa. The city was largely destroyed during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the latter part of the seventh century, although a ribat was built there, probably on the ruins of an earlier Byzantine fortress. The city itself was abandoned and never resettled. ==Religion== From the third century until its destruction, Leptis was represented by bishops in various councils of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Councils of Carthage in 256, 411, 484, and 641. The diocese was also involved in the great conflict of African Christianity as Catholic and Donatist bishops for the town appear on the lists of participants in these councils. Among the noted bishops was Laetus, described as a \"zelous and very learned man\", numbered among those bishops killed by the Vandal king Huneric, after the council of 484.Butler & Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: September, p. 41. ==See also== * Leptis Magna ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Pseudo-Scylax, Periplus. * Polybius, Historiae (The Histories). * Gaius Sallustius Crispus (Sallust), Bellum Jugurthinum (The Jugurthine War). * Gaius Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili (Commentaries on the Civil War). * Aulus Hirtius (attributed), De Bello Africo (On the African War). * Titus Livius (Livy), History of Rome. * Pomponius Mela, De Situ Orbis (On the Places of the World). * Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Historia Naturalis (Natural History). * Appianus Alexandrinus (Appian), Bella Punica (The Punic Wars). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1854). * Alban Butler & Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: September, A&C; Black, (1995). * . ==External links== * Category:Phoenician colonies in Tunisia Category:Roman towns and cities in Tunisia ",
