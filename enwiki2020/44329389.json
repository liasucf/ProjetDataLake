He then migrated to Magdalen Hall, and commenced M.A. in June 1634, reputed in philosophy. About 1636 Clagett became vicar of St Michael with St Mary's Church, Melbourne, Derbyshire and about 1644 he was chosen lecturer or preacher at St. Mary's Church, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, where he was popular with the \"precise party\".

He died by 16 October 1662, when his will was proved, and was buried in the chancel of St Mary's Church. ==Family== With his wife Jane, who died at Bury St Edmunds on 23 August 1673, Clagett had two sons who became noted ministers, William Clagett and Nicholas Clagett the younger. ==Works== Clagett wrote: The Abuse of God's Grace; discovered in the Kinds, Causes, Punishments, Symptoms, Cures, Differences, Cautions, and other Practical Improvements thereof.
