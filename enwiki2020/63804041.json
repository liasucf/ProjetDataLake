    "text": "Understanding is an album by trumpeter/composer Wallace Roney which was recorded in 2012 and released on the HighNote label the following year.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed April 28, 2020 ==Reception== Allmusic's Matt Collar said \"Understanding, is an expansive, often swinging work that finds the trumpeter digging even deeper into the straight-ahead if no less adventurous sound of his recent releases. These are bluesy, harmonically layered modal songs that bring to mind such touchstones as '70s Woody Shaw and late-'60s Miles Davis\". Financial Times reviewer, Mike Hobart, stated \"The ex- Miles Davis understudy confirms he is now something of an elder statesman with this sextet recording featuring young unknowns who are full of promise\".Hobart, M. Financial Time Review, May 1, 2010, accessed April 28, 2020 In JazzTimes, Michael J. West noted \"Roney was a dyed-in-the-wool Young Lion. Understanding, a sextet session and his first all-acoustic album in over a decade, places him back in that context, with (mostly) wondrous results ... Technical virtuosity, dense harmony and zealous swing abound. At its best, melody abounds too\".West, M. J.
