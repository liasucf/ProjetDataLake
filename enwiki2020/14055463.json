    "text": "James O'Brien (1945 \u2013 19 August 2020) was an Irish hurler. At club level he played as a centre-back for Bruree and was the left corner-back on the Limerick senior hurling team that won the 1973 All-Ireland Championship. O'Brien's skill was recognised at an early age when he won a South Limerick school's medal with Bruree National School, before an unrewarding spell at Rathluirc CBS. His career at club level with Bruree spanned three decades. O'Brien won a Munster Championship medal with the Limerick minor hurling team in 1963, before being subsequently selected for the Limerick under-21 and junior teams. He made his first appearance for the Limerick senior hurling team during the 1966-67 National League and enjoyed his greatest successes as a defender over the following decade. In 1973 O'Brien became the first Bruree clubman to win an All-Ireland Championship medal, having earlier won Munster Championship and National Hurling League titles. ==Honours== ;Limerick *All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1973 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1973, 1974 *National Hurling League (1): 1970-71 *Munster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 1963 ;Munster *Railway Cup (1): 1970 ;Awards *All-Star Award (1): 1973 == References == Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Bruree hurlers Category:Limerick inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ",
