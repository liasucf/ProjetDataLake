He is the most brilliant of the K\u016bfan scholars. Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Al-Jahm quotes Ibn al-Qu\u1e6drub that it was al-Farr\u0101\u2019s melodic eloquence and knowledge of the pure spoken Arabic of the Bedouins and their expressions that won him special favour at the court of H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd. He died on the way to Mecca, aged about sixty, or sixty-seven, in 822 (207 AH). ==Life== Ab\u016b Zakar\u012byah ibn Ziy\u0101d al-Farr\u0101\u2019 was born in al-K\u016bfah into a family of Iranian Daylam\u012b origin. He was a mawla (client, or, apprentice) of the Ban\u016b Minqar (), although Salamah ibn \u2018\u0100\u1e63im said he was called al-\u2018Abs\u012b (), i.e. of the Ban\u016b Abs. Ab\u016b \u2018Abd All\u0101h ibn Muqlah () claimed Al-Y\u016bsuf\u012b called him Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Ziy\u0101d ibn Q\u0101w\u012b-Bakht ibn D\u0101war ibn K\u016bdan\u0101r. The main details of his life come from Tha\u2018lab () who quotes A\u1e25mad ibn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 saying: \u201cIf the expression spoils the meaning it is not the words of the Bedouin Arabs, or \u2018pure\u2019. But al-Farr\u0101\u2019 says it correctly because he based Arabic and grammar on the spoken language of the Arabs. He (al-Farr\u0101) said: When the expression agrees with its meaning, the expression is correct. S\u012bbawayh errs because his etymological work is not founded in the expressions of the 'Desert Arabs' (Bedouin) and is without knowledge of their oral language and their poems, but instead relies on the poems of the urban Arabs and the pharaohs and applies the expression to the meaning.\u201d Al-Farr\u0101\u2019 was said to be called Farr\u0101\u2019 because he was 'free to speak'. He knew the grammarians of al-K\u016bfah after the time of al-Kis\u0101\u2019\u012b's, whom he adopted. The K\u016bfans claimed that he borrowed much from Y\u016bnus ibn Hab\u012bb but this was denied by the Ba\u1e63rans. He loved to speak and yet was retiring and pious. He was a zealous adherent of S\u012bbawayh, writing under his leadership. In his Al-Hudud he used philosophical terminology. Tha'lab relates that al-Farr\u0101\u2019s was a friend of \u2018Umar ibn Bukayr (), the preceptor to the vizier of the caliph Al-Ma'm\u016bn, who was called \u0100mir al-\u1e24asan ibn Sahl (). Al-Farr\u0101 taught in the mosque next to his house. Umar approached him for exegetic advice on teaching Qur'\u0101nic studies to the vizier, and so al-Farr\u0101' dictated the book Ma\u2018\u0101n\u012b aI-Qur\u2019\u0101n for his students to copy out. At the request of the caliph al-Ma'mun he dictated his Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ud\u016bd (), 'Classifications' (in poetry and grammar), as a project to instruct the students of al-Kis\u0101\u2019\u012b. Over the sixteen year period it took to complete, a muezzin reader read while al-Farr\u0101\u2019 explained the entire Qur\u2019\u0101n. He continued dictating long after most students had lost interest and only two remained. Instruction without recourse to a text book was a good proof of memory and the mark of a great scholar. Tha'lab makes a point of saying that al-Farr\u0101\u2019 was only once seen with a book and that was his dictation from a manuscript of the chapter \u2018Mul\u0101zim\u2019. A neighbour of Al-Farr\u0101\u2019s, named al- W\u0101qid\u012b (), remarked on al-Farr\u0101\u2019 particular use of philosophical terms in his literary dictations. Al-Farr\u0101\u2019 lived most of his life at Baghd\u0101d and was very frugal, and even hunger did not concern him. He spent forty days annually at al-K\u016bfah, his native town, and distributed most of his considerable earnings from teaching among his people. His father Ziad had his hand cut off in the war with Ab\u012b Tharwan and Ab\u016b Tharwan the mawla of the Ban\u016b Abs. Ibn al-Nad\u012bm lists Al-Farr\u0101's associates as Ibn Q\u0101dim and Salamah ibn \u0100\u1e63im, who was with him in his final illness, when his mind had gone. Those who quoted him listed by Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b were; Qais ibn al-Rab\u012b, Mandal ibn \u2018Al\u012b al-Kis\u0101\u2019\u012b, Salamah ibn \u0100\u1e63im and Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Jahm al-Samari, who transmitted his books. Salamah ibn \u0100\u1e63im said it was al-\u1e6cuw\u0101l () who preserved his only extant poetry in some verses quoted by Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfah al-D\u012bnawar\u012b (): ==Works== *Al-'a\u2019r\u0101b f\u012b Aswal al-\u2018Arab\u012bya () \u2018The Arabians, about Arabic Roots\u2019; *Al-Na\u1e63b al-Mutwallad min al-Fa\u2019al () \u2018Al-Na\u1e63b [form of relation] Derived from the Verb\u2019; *Al-Ma\u2019rifat wa-l-Nakira () \u2018The Definite and the Indefinite\u2019; *Min wa-Rubb () \u201c\u2018From\u2019 and \u2018Perhaps\u2019\u201d; *Al-\u2018Adad () \u2018Numbers\u2019; *Mul\u0101zamah wa-\u1e24all () \u2018Invariable and Variable\u2019; *\u2018Al-\u2018Im\u0101d () \u2018Pronoun between subject and predicate\u2019; *Al-fi\u2019l al- W\u0101qi\u2018 () \u2018The Transitive Verb\u2019; *Inna wa 'Akhwatuha () \u2018\"Inna\" [a particle] and Its Sister Particle\u2019; *Kay wa-Kay-la () \u201c\u2018In Order that\u2019 and \u2018Lest\u2019\u201d; *\u1e24att\u0101 () \u201c\u2018Until,\u2019 \u2018So That\u2019\u201d; *Al-Ighr\u0101' () \u2018Instigating\u2019; *Al-Du\u2018\u0101\u2019 () \u2018Calling, Addressing [as in prayer]\u2019; *Al-N\u016bn\u012bn al-shad\u012bdat wa-l-Khaf\u012bfa () \u2018The Two Forms of N\u016bn (N), Heavy and Light; *Al-Istifh\u0101m () \u2018Interrogation\u2019; *Al-Jaz\u0101\u2019 () \u2018Division\u2019; *Al-Jaw\u0101b () \u2018The Answer\u2019; *Alladh\u012b, Man, wa-M\u0101 () \u201c\u2018Who,\u2019 \u2018Who?,\u2019 and \u2018What\u2019\u201d; *Rubb wa-Kam () \u2018\u2018Perhaps\u2019 and \u2018How Many?\u2019\u2019; *Al- Qasam () \u2018The Oath\u2019; *Tanaw\u012bya wa-l-muthann\u0101 () \u2018Double and Dual\u2019; *Al-Nid\u0101\u2019 () \u2018The Call\u2019 (Proclamation). *Al-Nudba () \u2018The Elegy\u2019; *Al-Tarkh\u012bm () \u2018Dropping the last letter of a noun\u2019; *An al-Maft\u016b\u1e25a () \u2018An (\u2018That') Spelled with Alif (open)\u2019 *Idh, Idh\u0101, and Idhan () \u2018forms of \u2018if\u2019\u2019; *Ma lam yasm f\u0101\u2019ilhu () \u2018What Does Not Mention Its Subject\u2019; *Law () \u2018\"If\", or \"Notwithstanding\", in Construction and Separate\u2019; *Al-\u1e24ik\u0101ya () \u2018Narrative\u2019; *Al-Ta\u1e63gh\u012br() \u2018Making the Diminutive\u2019; *Al-Tathn\u012byah () \u2018Forming the Dual\u2019; *Al-Huj\u0101\u2019() \u2018Spelling\u2019; *R\u0101ja\u2019 al-Dhikar () \u2018Referring Back\u2019; *Al-Fa\u2019al al- Rab\u0101\u2019\u012b () \u2018Verb with Four Consonants\u2019; *Al-Fa\u2019al al-Thal\u0101th\u012b () \u2018Verb with Three Consonants\u2019; *Al-Mu\u2019rab min Mak\u0101n\u012bn () \u2018A Word Declined from Two Places; *Al-Adgh\u0101m () \u2018Making a Double Letter (Incorporation Together)\u2019; *Al-Hamza () \u2018Marking with a \u1e24amzah\u2019; *Al-Ibn\u012bya () \u2018Structures\u2019; *Al-Juma\u2019 () \u2018The Plural\u2019; *Al-Maqs\u016br wa-al-Mamd\u016bd () \u2018The Shortened and the Lengthened\u2019; *Al- Mudhakar wa al-Mu\u2019anith () \u2018Masculine and Feminine\u2019; *Fa\u2018ala wa-Af\u2018ala\u2019 () Verbs and verbal forms; *Al-Nuh\u012b () \u2018The Interdiction\u2019; *Al-Ibtid\u0101\u2019 wa-al- Qa\u1e6da\u2019 () \u2018Stopping and Starting\u2019; *M\u0101 Yajr\u0101 wa-ma l\u0101 Yajr\u0101 () \u2018What [Form] Is Current and What Is Not Current.\u2019 ==External Links== ==See also== *List of Iranian scientists and scholars ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * Category:761 births Category:822 deaths Category:Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:9th-century linguists Category:9th-century philologists Category:9th-century scholars Category:Grammarians of Arabic Category:Grammarians of Kufa Category:Philologists of Arabic Category:8th- century Iranian people Category:9th-century Iranian people Category:Daylamites Category:Iranian grammarians Category:Iranian scholars ",
