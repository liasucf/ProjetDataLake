An English translation by Vyvyan Holland was published in 1925. ==Reception== Isabel Paterson wrote in The Bookman: \"The titular figures of Paul Morand's Lewis and Irene are symbols rather than types. They resemble the angularized conventions of modern painting, which returns to the archaic in search of novelty.\" Paterson continued: \"Morand strives for detachment, carefully avoids any hint of a moral or a thesis. The sensualist Lewis is just a bundle of appetites and aptitudes without passion or real intelligence; he has the sleek sufficiency of a beast of prey. Irene is merely his opposite. Their behavior has no ethical meaning; it is like a series of chemical reactions. The book is clever, thin, and dry.\" ==References== ==External links== * Lewis and Irene at the French publisher's website Category:1924 French novels Category:Novels by Paul Morand ",
