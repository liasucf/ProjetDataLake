    "text": "Below the Radio is a mixtape put together by Jason Lytle of American indie rock band Grandaddy, released in 2004 by record label Ultra. The album also included a new Grandaddy track, \"Nature Anthem\". == Background == Ultra Records had approached Grandaddy frontman Jason Lytle via his management some time earlier with the idea for him to compile a mixtape, and he decided to include tracks that he considered \"sleeper hits\", identifying a common theme: \"They all seem to have pretty conventional and familiar chord progressions. They all have vivid imagery for me with their words. There also seems to be a bit of sadness, but not necessarily despair.\" == Reception == AllMusic's Matt Collar stated the album \"plays like a K-Tel commercial for Gen X sad-sackism\", calling it \"pretty cool\". Brian Howe of Pitchfork wrote \"for the most part, the songs [Lytle] selected sound quite a bit like his own band. Lush yet sleek and slightly sterile is the dominant style of Below the Radio\". == Track listing == # Beck \u2013 \"We Live Again\" # Beulah \u2013 \"Burned by the Sun\" # Earlimart \u2013 \"Color Bars\" # Snow Patrol \u2013 \"Run\" # Goldenboy \u2013 \"Wild Was The Night\" # Giant Sand \u2013 \"Bottom Line Man\" # Fruit Bats \u2013 \"The Little Acorn\" # Home \u2013 \"Comin' Up Empty Again\" # Jackpot \u2013 \"If We Could Go Backwards\" # The Handsome Family \u2013 \"I Fell\" # Little Wings \u2013 \"Sand Canyon\" # Pavement \u2013 \"Motion Suggests\" # Blonde Redhead \u2013 \"For the Damaged\" # Virgil Shaw \u2013 \"Twisted Layer\" # Grandaddy \u2013 \"Nature Anthem\" == References == == External links == * Category:2004 compilation albums Category:Grandaddy albums ",
