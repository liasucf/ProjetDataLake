    "text": "Damelin is a private college, with 17 campuses, owned by Educor (the Education Investment Corporation Limited) group. It was founded by Benjamin Damelin in 1943. Despite offering degrees, diplomas and other higher qualifications, Damelin is considered a college instead of a university due to the regulations for tertiary institutions in South Africa. Damelin is a wholly owned division of Educor (the Education Investment Corporation Limited) group, which National Pride Trading 452 purchased in January 2008. Damelin is the oldest and most profitable education subsidiary owned by Educor. By November 2012, over one million students had graduated from Damelin. Educor is a wholly owned division of A1 Capital, owned by Leo Chetty. It is one of the largest education service providers in Africa. ==History== In 1943, Benjamin Damelin established Damelin as a \"cramming college for white students\". In 1951, Johann Brummer joined Damelin as a teacher, in 1952, becoming a partner and serving as Educor's Executive chairman until his resignation in 1998. One of the key aspects in the development of the Damelin name was initiated in 1952 when Brummer started developing materials for long distance learning, which later became the Damelin Correspondence College in 1955. In the early years of the 1960s, Damelin began offering evening classes at what would later become their Johannesburg Campus . In 1968, the Damelin Management School was established and offered education and training to adults for the attainment of Damelin certificates. In the 1970s, many of the prisoners imprisoned on Robben Island were registered as students of Damelin. In 1985, the Damelin Computer School, which only offered part-time programs at the time, was established in Johannesburg. By 1991, Damelin had started offering contact instruction to University of South Africa students, which had been established for middle- class African students who were unable to gain entry into universities of higher prestige with higher level education. All these programs were coordinated at the same Johannesburg site for many years until 1993, when the Braamfontein Campus was founded. In 1998, the University of Pretoria approached the Damelin Computer School to facilitate the computer training of residential students of the University of Pretoria on their main campus because their IT faculty was better suited to training undergraduates than the University of Pretoria's . By 2005, Damelin was the only institution in Southern Africa whose Bachelor of Commerce degrees were recognized by the Oxford Brookes University, a university established in 1992. In 2007, Damelin aligned their programs with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and by 2008, Damelin was offering more than 200 NQF programs. In 2008, Educor was purchased by National Pride Trading 452 as a going concern and the Milpark Business School started integrating the Damelin School of Banking and Insurance's academic operations as part of their offerings.http://www.skillsportal.co.za/page/training/articles/186889-Top- financial-business-school-now-also-a-registered-private-FET- college#.Ub9XbeeBm2E In 2013, Pacofs signed a three-year contract with Damelin for the training of audio engineers. In October 2013, the Damelin Gaborone campus cut its ties with Damelin South Africa and renamed itself. From November 2013 as part of an initiative in the South African education sector called Project Athena, the South African telecommunication company Telkom has pledged to give over 40 000 SIM cards to Damelin students over the course of three months. In the next phase of this project, free Wi-Fi access is to be implemented across selected Damelin campuses for students to use. == Accreditation and registration == In South Africa, institutes providing education are required to obtain accreditation with one of the 33 Education & Training Quality Assurance bodies (ETQAs) which are in turn accredited by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA). Damelin, and its various campuses hold provisional accreditation with Umalusi, the highest possible accreditation obtainable with that particular ETQA. Damelin is also on the registers of private higher and further education & training providers at South Africa's Department of Higher Education and Training for an extensive list of qualifications. Damelin, through its international affiliation network, also allows South African based learners a channel with which to obtain qualifications, licenses and certificates conferred by various international organisations. == Mode of delivery == While other institutions under Educor offer other modes of delivery, (e.g. correspondence), Damelin focuses on the following face-to-face modes: * Full-time tuition, learners register to study full-time. * Part-time tuition, where employed individuals take classes after work or on Saturday mornings. * Corporate training, where courses, or modules thereof are condensed into full day events spanning a few days or a week. == Qualifications and certificates == Damelin runs programmes that culminate in a variety of forms of recognition, such as programmes leading to: * Certificates conferred by Damelin * Certificates conferred by ETQAs * Certificates conferred by international institutions * Certificates recognising achievement for skills based courses which do not fall into the category of a full qualification. ==Organisation and administration== Damelin is a subsidiary of Educor and most of the organisational and administrative duties are handled by Educor. == Student life == Students have access to the College Driver Programme, a programme coordinated on each campus by Damelin and Toyota that allows students to practice their basic parking and driving techniques. Prospective students have the option to undertake a free career analysis that will assist them in deciding which course and career path is most suitable for them. Students are legible for a partial bursary based on their cultural, academic or athletic performance in high school as part of the Damelin Achiever Bursary Awards initiative. The discounts are not cumulative and they are granted based on the highest level of achievement of the student. The following table illustrates the extent to which a student's fees may be discounted. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Damelin Achiever Bursary Awards |- |Discount || Sports || Academic, cultural and other awards |- | 50% || National Colours || Head prefect |- | 30% || Provincial Colours || Deputy head prefect |- | 20% || Regional Colours || Honour roll, prefect, captaincy |- | 10% || First Team || Full colours |- |} Students who study for the Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing and Business Management, Accounting or Information Management can download course material from Damelin's website.
