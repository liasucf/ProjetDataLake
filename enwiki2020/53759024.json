    "text": "The Aberdeenshire Council election of 2017 was held on 4 May 2017, on the same day as the other Scottish local government elections. The election will use the 19 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 70 councillors being elected, an increase of one member compared to 2012. The Scottish Conservatives returned the most councillors, the first time it has been the largest party in the region since the 1982 election, when the area was under the Grampian Regional Council, although they were stopped short of an overall majority. The number of Scottish National Party councillors fell by a quarter but remained the second largest group. The Scottish Liberal Democrats picked up a couple of seats while the other parties gained roughly the same results as the previous election. On 18 May, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Aligned Independents formed an administration, with Jim Gifford (Conservative) elected as council leader and Bill Howatson (Liberal Democrat) was made Provost. ==Results== Note: \"Votes\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007. This may differ from other published sources showing gain/loss relative to seats held at dissolution of Scotland's councils. ==Ward results== ===Banff and District=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 1 x Conservative *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Independent *2012-2017: 1 x Independent gain from SNP ===Troup=== *2012: 1 x SNP, 1 x Independent, 1 x Conservative *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Independent, 1 x Conservative *2012-2017 Change: No Change ===Fraserburgh and District=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 2 x Independent *2017: 2 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Independent *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Conservative gain from Independent ===Central Buchan=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Independent *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x Independent *2012-2017: Change: 1 x Liberal Democrat gain from SNP ===Peterhead North and Rattray=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 2 x Independent *2017: 2 x Independent, 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Conservative gain from SNP ===Peterhead South and Cruden=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 1 x Independent *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Independent *2012-2017 Change: Conservatives gain one seat from SNP ===Turriff and District=== *2012: 1 x SNP, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x Independent *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x Independent *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Conservative win due to one additional seat compared to 2012 * = Sitting Councillor for Banff and District Ward. ===Mid- Formartine=== *2012: 2 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Independent *2017: 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x Independent *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Liberal Democrat gain from SNP ===Ellon and District=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2017: 2xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: no change ===West Garioch=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xCon *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: no change ===Inverurie and District=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLibDem; 1xIndependent *2012-2017 Change: Independent gain one seat from SNP ===East Garioch=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xGRN; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xSNP; 1xGRN; 1xLib Dem; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: One additional seat in the assembly, gained by Conservatives ===Westhill and District=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2017: 2xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLibDem *2012-2017 Change: Conservatives gain one seat from SNP ===Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe of Alford=== *2012: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLibDem *2012-2017 Change: Conservatives gain one seat from Independent ===Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside=== *2012: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: no change ===Banchory and Mid-Deeside=== *2012: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: no change ===North Kincardine=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: no change ===Stonehaven and Lower Deeside=== *2012: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xLib Dem *2017: 2xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLibDem *2012-2017 Change: Conservatives gain one seat from Labour ===Mearns=== *2012: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xCon; 1xSNP; 1xLibDem *2012-2017 Change: Conservatives gain one seat from Independent ==Changes since 2017== *\u2020 Inverurie & District Conservative Cllr Colin Clark was elected as an MP for Gordon on 8 June 2017.
