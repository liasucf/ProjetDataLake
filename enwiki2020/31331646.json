He wrote the music for the films Tkies-khaf (The Vow) and On a heym (Homeless) (directed in Warsaw by Alexander Martin from the drama by Jacob Gordin), in which Wiera Gran sang his Aheym, aheym and Beser in troym tsurik. His greatest artistic success was the musical score to Lope de Vega's Fuenteovejuna, a show produced by Ida Kami\u0144ska's theatre company. He also composed the music for Der Tunkeler's musical comedy Got's ganovim (God's thieves) produced by the Vilner Troupe in 1935. When the rise of anti-Semitism led to a \"extermination process of Jewish musicians from their Polish work-places\" and when in response a Jewish symphonic orchestra was created in Warsaw, Szajewicz was chosen as its director. Its concerts, held on Saturdays and Sundays between 10 and 12 in the Novoshtshi Theatre, were a great success. At the outbreak of World War II, Szajewicz fled to Bia\u0142ystok, where he was chosen to lead the symphonic orchestra. He also toured in Minsk. When German and Soviet conflict broke out in 1941 he wasn\u2019t able to evacuate; he headed back to Warsaw to be with his mother, but somewhere in the woods between Bia\u0142ystok and Baranowicze he died in unknown circumstances. ==Read more== * Manger, Turkow, and Perenson: Yidisher teater in Eyrope (pp 99, 101, 119) * Ariye Martakover: Yorbukh, Tel-Aviv 1967 p. 339 * Yonas Turkow: Farlozhene Shtern (Lost stars), Book one, page 114; Book two pp. 209 and 291 * Zigmunt Turkow: Di ibergerisene Tkifeh p. 209 * Micha\u0142 Weichert: Zikhroynes, tsveyter band (Varshe), p. 343 * Leon Tadeusz Blaszczyk: Dyrygenci Polscy i obcy w Polsce w XIX and XX wieku (p. 292) ==Filmography== * W walce o zdrowie, 1937 * Tkies khaf (The Vow), 1937 * On a Heym (Without a Home) 1939 ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Kutno Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish cabaret performers Category:Polish conductors (music) Category:Male conductors (music) Category:Jewish composers Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century comedians Category:20th-century male musicians ",
