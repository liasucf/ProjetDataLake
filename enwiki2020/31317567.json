It was a \"fast-moving epifaunal detritivore\" from Canada (British Columbia, specifically Burgess Shale, and Newfoundland) and the United States (Idaho, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Vermont).Paleobiology Database. \"Chancia\", accessed March 27, 2011. Chancia was a particle feeder. Its major characteristics are a normal glabella but an enlarged cephalon due to a pre- glabellar field in front of the glabella, as well as developed eye ridges, medium-sized genal spines, and an extremely small pygidium.Coppold, Murray and Wayne Powell (2006).
