    "text": "The Phantom of the Opera is a British musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Charles Hart, and a book by Lloyd Webber and Richard Stilgoe. Based on the 1910 French novel of the same name by Gaston Leroux, its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, Christine Daa\u00e9, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Op\u00e9ra House. The musical opened in London's West End in 1986, and on Broadway in 1988. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, and Michael Crawford (in the title role) won the Olivier and Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical. It is currently the longest running show in Broadway history, and celebrated its 10,000th Broadway performance on 11 February 2012, the first production ever to do so.Gerald Martin Bordman (2004). The Oxford companion to American theatre p.496. Oxford University Press. \"A British musical based on Leroux's famous novel\".

Scarecrow Press, 2009Smith, Tim (11 April 2010) 'Phantom of the Opera\u2019 at the Hippodrome The Baltimore Sun With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $6 billion and total Broadway gross of over $1 billion, Phantom was the most financially successful entertainment event until The Lion King surpassed it in 2014.\"Phantom of the Opera Screening Earns Over \u00a3500,000 in the UK\", BroadwayWorld.com, 5 October 2011Gans, Andrew. \"The Lion King Is Now Top- Earner in Box-Office History\", Playbill, 22 September 2014. By 2011, it had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities across 27 countries. ==Development== ===Idea=== In 1984, Lloyd Webber contacted Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, to propose a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw any effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: \"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!\"Andrew Lloyd Webber, Martin Knowlden The Phantom of the Opera Companion Pavilion, 2007 ===Lyricists === Lloyd Webber first approached Jim Steinman to write the lyrics because of his \"dark obsessive side\", but he declined in order to fulfill his commitments on a Bonnie Tyler album. Alan Jay Lerner was then recruited, but he became seriously ill after joining the project and was forced to withdraw; none of his contributions (mostly involving the song \"Masquerade\") are credited in the show.Citron, Stephen. Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber (2001), Oxford University Press US, , p. 330Behr, Edward. The Complete Book of Les Mis\u00e9rables (1993),Arcade Publishing, , p. 62 Richard Stilgoe, the lyricist for Starlight Express, wrote most of the original lyrics for the production. Charles Hart, a young and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics, along with original lyrics for \"Think of Me\". Some of Stilgoe's original contributions are still present in the final version, however.Behind the Mask documentary, on the 2004 film DVD Phantom is primarily a sung-through musical, however there are scattered lines of spoken dialogue. ===Score=== Inspired in part by an earlier musical version of the same story by Ken Hill, Lloyd Webber's score is sometimes operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the fictional operas that are taking place within the show itself, viz., Hannibal, Il Muto, and the Phantom's masterwork, Don Juan Triumphant. \"Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of Meyerbeer through to Mozart and even Gilbert and Sullivan.\"Coveney, M. Cats on a Chandelier: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Story. New York, Hutchinson (1999). pp. 200\u2013206. These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical's \"show within a show\" format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's opera, \"Don Juan Triumphant\", heard during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern\u2014\"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically\".Snelson, J. Andrew Lloyd Webber (Yale Broadway Masters Series). New Haven, Yale University Press (2009), p. 88. ===Design, direction, and choreography=== Maria Bj\u00f6rnson designed the sets and over 200 costumes, including the elaborate gowns in the \"Masquerade\" sequence. Her set designs, including the chandelier, subterranean gondola, and sweeping staircase, earned her multiple awards.Maria Bjornson Dies; Theatre Production Designer was 53 (16 December 2002).

Hal Prince, director of Cabaret, Candide, Follies, and Lloyd Webber's Evita, directed the production, while Gillian Lynne, associate director and choreographer of Cats, provided the integral musical staging and choreography. ==West End and Broadway== ===First preview at Sydmonton=== A preview of the first act was staged at Sydmonton (Lloyd Webber's home) in 1985, starring Colm Wilkinson (later the star of the Toronto production) as the Phantom, Sarah Brightman as Kristin (later Christine), and Clive Carter (later a member of the London cast) as Raoul. This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe's original unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later changed, such as \"What Has Time Done to Me\" (\"Think of Me\"), and \"Papers\" (\"Notes\"). The Phantom's original mask covered the entire face and remained in place throughout the performance, obscuring the actor's vision and muffling his voice. Maria Bj\u00f6rnson designed the now-iconic half-mask to replace it, and the unmasking sequence was added.

On 28 July 2020, producer Cameron Mackintosh stated that the production had shut down permanently but was \"determined\" for it to return to The West End sometime in the future. Lloyd Webber denied the claims of a permanent closure. It was later confirmed the show would return with a \"brand new physical production of Maria Bjornson's original design, in a refurbished theatre\". ===Broadway=== Majestic Theatre Phantom began Broadway previews at the Majestic Theatre on 9 January 1988 and opened on 26 January.

The New York Times' Frank Rich writes: \"It may be possible to have a terrible time at The Phantom of the Opera, but you'll have to work at it. Only a terminal prig would let the avalanche of pre-opening publicity poison his enjoyment of this show, which usually wants nothing more than to shower the audience with fantasy and fun, and which often succeeds, at any price.\" Howard Kissel from New York Daily News commended the production, calling it \"a spectacular entertainment, visually the most impressive of the British musicals\", and praised Lloyd Webber's score despite its \"synthetic, borrowed quality\" as well as Michael Crawford's \"powerful\" performance. Maria Bj\u00f6rnson's set and costume design in particular garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers calling it \"a breathtaking, witty, sensual tribute to 19th century theater\" as well as \"marvels of period atmospheric detail and technical savvy\". As of 12 March 2020, the show suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show's production will be suspended until 31 May 2021 at the earliest. ==Synopsis== ===Prologue=== In 1905 Paris, the Op\u00e9ra Populaire hosts an auction of old theatrical memorabilia. Among the attendees is the elderly Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who purchases a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 music box with a monkey figurine. The auctioneer then presents a shattered chandelier renovated with electrical wiring, alluding to a connection with \"the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained.\" As the porters remove the drop cloth covering the fixture, it flickers to life and ascends to the ceiling (\"Overture\"). ===Act I=== It is now 1881 and the cast of a new production, Hannibal, are rehearsing onstage when they learn that new owners, Firmin and Andr\u00e9, are taking over the Op\u00e9ra Populaire (\"Hannibal Rehearsal\"). Carlotta, the Op\u00e9ra's resident soprano prima donna, begins to perform an aria for the new managers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her and prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, \"He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!\". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily insists that such things have been happening for \"three years\" and she storms out, quitting the show. Madame Giry, the Op\u00e9ra's ballet mistress, and her dancer daughter Meg inform Firmin and Andr\u00e9 that Christine Daa\u00e9, a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been \"well taught\" and can sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold-out show being their only other alternative, the managers reluctantly audition her and are surprised to discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Op\u00e9ra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognizes her as his childhood friend and playmate (\"Think of Me\"). Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performing the title song Backstage after her triumphant d\u00e9but, Christine confesses to her friend Meg that her singing has been inspired by an unseen tutor she knows only as the \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\"). Raoul pays a visit to Christine's dressing room and the two reminisce about \"Angel of Music\" stories that her late father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (\"Little Lotte\"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (\"The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)\"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the shadowy sewers below the Op\u00e9ra house. The two board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (\"The Phantom of the Opera\"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his musical compositions. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a wedding dress, the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine, and she faints from shock. The Phantom then covers her tenderly with his cloak and puts her on a bed (\"The Music of the Night\"). The next morning, as the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the Phantom's monkey music box (\"I Remember\"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture, and Christine runs in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom, and he escorts her back above ground. Meanwhile, Joseph Buquet, the Op\u00e9ra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \"Op\u00e9ra Ghost\" and his terrible Punjab lasso (a reference directly from the novel). Madame Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face the Phantom's wrath (\"Magical Lasso\"). In the managers' office, Andr\u00e9 and Firman read notes from the Phantom and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst in, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note warning that her \"days at the Op\u00e9ra Populaire are numbered\". As Andr\u00e9 and Firmin try to calm Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta as the Countess in the new opera, Il Muto, and that Box 5 is to be kept empty for him. The managers are warned they will face a \"disaster beyond imagination\" if these demands are not met (\"Notes\"). Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure the furious Carlotta that she will remain their star and Christine will play the Pageboy, a silent role (\"Prima Donna\"). The premi\u00e8re of Il Muto initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him as he had directed. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little toad\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and enchants the diva's voice, reducing it to a frog-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, and he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\"). In the ensuing chaos after \"Il Muto\", Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her; Christine reciprocates his vow (\"All I Ask of You\"). Christine and Raoul go back inside, unaware that the Phantom has overheard their entire conversation. The heartbroken Phantom angrily vows revenge before returning to the auditorium and crashing the chandelier onto the stage during the curtain call (\"All I Ask of You (reprise)\"). ===Act Il=== Steve Barton and Sarah Brightman in the final scene Six months later, the Opera house hosts a masquerade ball. The Phantom, who has been conspicuously absent since the chandelier disaster, suddenly reappears in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant during his absence, and demands that it be produced with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met. Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent\"). As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Madame Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face and was ostracized for it. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a traveling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He subsequently took refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home. The Opera managers, believing they have no choice, reluctantly plan to produce the Phantom's opera. Before rehearsals begin, Raoul plots to use the premi\u00e8re of Don Juan Triumphant as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind, suggesting that it is all a ploy to make her the star. Christine angrily defends herself, explaining that she is his victim just like everyone else. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fianc\u00e9e, asserts that the Phantom will attend the opera's premi\u00e8re and begs a reluctant Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap, but she refuses (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). During rehearsal, Piangi is unable to sing his part in the new opera, causing frustration and chaos for everyone. The piano suddenly begins to play the piece by itself (having been possessed by the Phantom) and the entire company immediately sings the proper notes in unison. Torn between her love for Raoul and her awe of the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"). The weary Christine begins to succumb to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the mausoleum (\"Bravo Monsieur\"). With armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the Phantom, Don Juan Triumphant premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that the Phantom has somehow replaced Piangi (\"Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses his love for Christine and forces his ring onto her finger. Christine rips off his mask, showing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Exposed, the Phantom hurriedly drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, search for the Phantom. Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair and warns him to beware the magical lasso. (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\"). Down in the lair, the Phantom has compelled Christine to don a wedding dress. In a moment of epiphany, she explains that she is not fearful of his physical appearance, but rather his inner nature. Raoul reaches the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine and begs him for compassion. The Phantom retorts that the world had never shown him any and ensnares Raoul in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (\"The Point of No Return Reprise\"). As the Phantom and Raoul both vie for Christine, she sadly asks the Phantom what life he has been forced to live. Finally, she tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion for the first time in his life. Having experienced kindness at last, the Phantom realises that he cannot win Christine by force, and frees Raoul. The Phantom makes them swear to never tell and yells for them to leave before collapsing in tears. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom finally tells Christine he loves her and she tearfully exits the lair to rejoin Raoul. As the angry search mob closes in, the devastated Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is first to reach the lair and finds no one there. She approaches the throne with curiosity and quickly pulls away the Phantom's cloak, but finds only his mask. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at it in wonder as the curtain falls (\"Finale\"). ==Casting== ===Original casts=== The original casts of the major productions of The Phantom of the Opera:POTO Onstage , phantom-media.info \u2013 accessed 10 May 2009 {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" |- !

Retrieved 31 January 2008 ===Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular=== An edited production renamed Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular opened 24 June 2006 at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show starred Brent Barrett and Anthony Crivello as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess and Elizabeth Loyacano as Christine, and Tim Martin Gleason as Roul. The theatre was built specifically for the show to resemble the Op\u00e9ra Garnier in Paris. The production ran 95 minutes with no intermission, and was directed and choreographed by Harold Prince and Gillian Lynne, with scenic designs by David Rockwell. The show featured updated technology and effects, including a re-engineered chandelier capable of reassembling in midair during the overture while the entire interior of the venue (not merely the stage) returned to its 1880s halcyon days. Almost 45 minutes' worth of material was eliminated, such as the Don Juan Triumphant rehearsal. \"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\" and \"The Point of No Return\" were significantly shortened. Other changes resembled those in the 2004 film, such as staging the chandelier crash at the plot's climax (during performance of \"The Point of No Return\") rather than mid-story. The Las Vegas production closed on 2 September 2012. === Planned French production=== A production was originally planned for the first ever French production in Paris at the Mogador Theatre in September 2016. A few days before the premiere, a fire damaged the stage floor and most of the backdrops and set pieces. ==Copyright release== In 2011 The Really Useful Group (copyright owners of Phantom) released certain rights to the play in celebration of its 25th anniversary. In March 2011 Reed-Custer High School in Braidwood, Illinois, became the first school to perform Phantom under the new rights. Later in 2011, Stanwell School in Penarth became the first school in the UK to perform the show. ==Popular culture references== In 1996, the Animaniacs episode \"Dot's Entertainment\" featured a collection of Lloyd Webber musicals, except for The Sound of Music which was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, being parodied and mixed into one play. One of which has Yakko Warner (voiced by Rob Paulsen) dressed as the Phantom and singing a parody of the song \"The Music of the Night\", causing the audience to fall asleep. The musical was featured in a cutaway gag in the Family Guy episode \"Deep Throats\", which the \"Music of the Night\" scene is interrupted by Peter Griffin (Seth MacFarlane) telling the Phantom to show the \"gross-half\" of his face so that he could leave the theatre, as well as \"That nose better be piggy!\", referencing Lon Chaney's 1925 film. In 2019, the song \"Masquerade\" was covered by the cast of the television series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina in the episode \"Chapter Twenty: The Mephisto Waltz\" from the first season. ==Awards and nominations== ===Original London production=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award Ceremony ! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category ! style=\"width:25%;\"| Nominee ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result |- | rowspan=\"4\" |1986 |Evening Standard Theatre Award | colspan=\"2\" |Best Musical | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Laurence Olivier Award | colspan=\"2\" |Best New Musical | |- | Best Actor in a Musical | Michael Crawford | |- | Designer of the Year | Maria Bj\u00f6rnson | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002 | colspan=\"2\"| Most Popular Show | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2016 | colspan=\"2\"| Magic Radio Audience Award | |} ===Original Broadway production=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award Ceremony ! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category ! style=\"width:25%;\"| Nominee ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result |- | rowspan=\"24\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1988 | rowspan=\"9\"| Drama Desk Award | colspan=\"2\"| Outstanding Musical | |- | Outstanding Actor in a Musical | Michael Crawford | |- | Outstanding Actress in a Musical | Sarah Brightman | |- | Outstanding Director of a Musical | Harold Prince | |- | Outstanding Music | Andrew Lloyd Webber | |- | Outstanding Orchestrations | David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber | |- | Outstanding Set Design | rowspan=\"2\"| Maria Bj\u00f6rnson | |- | Outstanding Costume Design | |- | Outstanding Lighting Design | Andrew Bridge | |- | rowspan=\"10\" | Tony Award | colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical | |- | Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical | Michael Crawford | |- | Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical | Judy Kaye | |- | Best Direction of a Musical | Harold Prince | |- | Best Book of a Musical | Richard Stilgoe and Andrew Lloyd Webber | |- | Best Original Score | Andrew Lloyd Webber, Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe | |- | Best Scenic Design | rowspan=\"2\"| Maria Bj\u00f6rnson | |- | Best Costume Design | |- | Best Lighting Design | Andrew Bridge | |- | Best Choreography | Gillian Lynne | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Outer Critics Circle Award | colspan=\"2\" |Best Broadway Musical | |- |Best Actor in a Musical |Michael Crawford | |- |Best Set Design | rowspan=\"2\" |Maria Bj\u00f6rnson | |- |Best Costume Design | |- |Best Lighting Design |Andrew Bridge | |} ==Sequel== The sequel to Phantom, written by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton, Frederick Forsyth and Glenn Slater, is called Love Never Dies. It was loosely adapted from the 1999 novel The Phantom of Manhattan, by Forsyth. Set in 1907 (a decade after the conclusion of Phantom according to the production's announcement, but actually 26 years later, as the original show was set in 1881), Christine is invited to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction at Coney Island, by an anonymous impresario. With her husband Raoul and son Gustave in tow, she journeys to Brooklyn, unaware that it is the Phantom who has arranged her appearance at the popular beach resort. The original production was directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with set and costume designs by Bob Crowley, and opened at the Adelphi Theatre in the West End on 9 March 2010. Though it ran for over 17 months and closed on 27 August 2011, the production received mixed reviews. A scheduled Broadway opening in November 2010 was postponed until Spring 2011 and later cancelled. A revamped Australian production, starring Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne, opened 21 May 2011 at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne to more favourable notices.Solomon, Les (30 May 2011): \"Australia's Creative Pride.\" AussieTheatre.com Retrieved 22 August 2001Herbert, Kate (30 May 2011): \"Australia Never Dies\" review.
