A contract was signed on 22 May 2020 for the construction of two Project 23900 LHDs with a displacement of +30,000 tons.https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/9197097 The construction is led by JSC Zelenodolsk Design Bureau, which is a part of JSC Ak Bars Shipbuilding Corporation, and the first vessel should be built by 2026. Previously, the Lavina (), and Priboy () designs were proposed by the Nevskoe Design Bureau and Krylov State Research Center as the replacement for Mistrals. Project 23900 is also a successor class to the Soviet unrealized Project 11780 LHD program. ==History== \"Priboy\" and \"Lavina\" designs were first revealed in June 2015 during the \u00abARMY-2015\u00bb military-technical forum, as a replacement for the two undelivered Mistral-class vessels ordered by Russia in 2011 under a $1.3 billion contract. However, due to the Western sanctions against Russia, the French side rejected to proceed with the delivery and the deal was suspended in 2015. France subsequently returned Russia the deposit paid for the construction of the two vessels. Both vessels were later sold to the Egyptian Navy. On 25 May 2017, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yury Borisov stated that construction cycle of new Russian helicopter carrier would last at least four years and first such ship will be completed by 2022. In June 2017, Vice President of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Igor Ponomarev said the \"Priboy\" helicopter carriers were implemented in Russia's New State Armament Programme for 2018\u20132025 and that the construction of the ships could be carried either by Severnaya Verf, Baltic Shipyard or Sevmash. In July 2017, a member of the Russia's State Duma Dmitry Belik announced, the lead ship of the class will be named Sevastopol, after the city of Sevastopol. The cost for the ship is to be about RUB40 billion ($675 million), and its construction would begin after approval of the New State Armament Programme for 2018-2025. On 11 September 2019, it was announced the first and second vessel of the class, with a displacement of 15,000 tons, will be laid down in May 2020 at Zaliv Shipyard, Crimea. On 22 May 2020, according to a TASS news agency report, the Russian Defence Ministry has signed a RUB100 billion worth deal for construction of two universal landing ships (LHDs), the construction of which will take place at the Zaliv Shipyard in Crimea. The two vessels should be delivered to the Russian Navy in 2026 and 2027, respectively. On 20 July 2020, during the laying down ceremony, the names of the first two ships were officially revealed. The ships were named Ivan Rogov and Mitrofan Moskalenko, same as already deccomissioned two Ivan Rogov-class vessels. ==Design== \"Lavina\" was the first designation for the class, revealed at the \u00abARMY-2015\u00bb military-technical forum, and stands for the heavier variant designed by Krylov with a displacement of about 24,000 tons. \"Priboy\" used to refer to the lighter variant designed by Nevskoe, and displacing about 14,000 tons.. However, based on images showed to Vladimir Putin at January 2020 exposition devoted to the future for the Russian Navy, the two Project 23900 LHDs ordered for the Russian Navy follow a design derivative from the French , having similar architecture and dimensions. The Project 23900 will be even larger and displace about +30,000 tons.https://tass.ru/armiya-i- opk/9197097 On July 20, 2020, at the official ceremony for the laying down of the Project 23900, a computer-generated image was showcased to represent the warship. Based on that image, the design of Project 23900 looks like a hybrid between the Lavina and the Mistral. ==Export== Krylov has also proposed an export version of the ship, dubbed \"Priboy-E\". ==Ships== Italics indicate estimates {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
