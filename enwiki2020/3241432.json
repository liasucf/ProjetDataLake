    "text": "Santiago de Vera was a native of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain and the sixth Spanish governor of the Philippines, from May 16, 1584 until May 1590. ==Governorship== Governor Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa and Domingo de Salazar, the first bishop of Manila, had requested the King of Spain to establish the Supreme Court of the Philippines then called the Audiencia, to settle disputes between the Church and State. In 1584, three judges arrived from Mexico and started the justice court with De Vera serving as the chief justice. After the sudden death of Governor Pe\u00f1alosa, Diego Ronquillo, his nephew became the governor ad interim but was later charged for defalcation in the trust of Pe\u00f1alosa's estate and was sent back to Spain as a prisoner. As the chief justice of the court, Santiago de Vera succeeded as the governor of the islands on May 16, 1584. ==First houses of stone== Ground plan of the Fort of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia built by Santiago de Vera in 1587 Following the great fire of Manila on March 19, 1583, which started during the wake of Governor Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa at the San Agustin Church, Santiago de Vera made an order that all construction in Manila should be of stone. It was found that stone could be easily cut near the banks of the Pasig in Guadalupe (now Guadalupe Viejo in Makati) and brought to Manila in boats. ==Fort of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia== He also built the first stone fort of Manila called Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia (Our Lady of Guidance) in 1587 located at the present location of San Diego Bastion (Baluarte de San Diego) at the southwestern corner of Intramuros with plans by a Jesuit named Sede\u00f1o. The artillery for this fort was cast by Panday Pira. De Vera also began to dig the moat which surrounded the city. He also built a stone breastwork along the Pasig riverfront. The great wall was not begun till the rule of G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez Dasmari\u00f1as.Jernegan, Prescott F. (1905). \"A Short History of the Philippines for use in Philippine schools\", p.104. D.
