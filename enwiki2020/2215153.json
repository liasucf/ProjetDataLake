He was one of the Handsome Eight.Deutsche Welle Croatian language service 19 July 2010 Nikola Pili\u0107 \u2013 'Prus sa Balkana' Pili\u0107 was ranked world No. 6 in January 1968 and world No. 7 for 1967 by Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph.United States Lawn Tennis Association (1972). Official Encyclopedia of Tennis (First edition), p. 428. ==Early life== Pili\u0107 was born in Split, Croatian Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia to Krsto Pili\u0107 and Danica Tomi\u0107-Feri\u0107 just five days before the outbreak of World War II that began on the 1st of September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. The youngster took up tennis during the summer of 1952.Nikola Pili\u0107: Krao sam novac od majke da kupim reket;Blic, 29 May 2011 Thirteen years of age at this point, he began practicing on the Firule tennis club clay courts in parallel to studying shipbuilding at the streamlined high school in Split. Upon graduating he attempted to enroll at a community college (vi\u0161a \u0161kola) in Zagreb, but due to not meeting the entrance criteria ended up in Novi Sad where he studied administration (vi\u0161a upravna \u0161kola). ==Tennis career== Pilic reached the semi finals of Wimbledon 1967, beating Roy Emerson before losing to John Newcombe. Then open tennis arrived and Pilic was one of the Handsome Eight, a group of players signed by Lamar Hunt in 1968 for the newly formed professional World Championship Tennis (WCT) group. In 1970, Pili\u0107 won the men's doubles title at the US Open together with his French partner Pierre Barth\u00e8s by defeating the Australians John Newcombe and Rod Laver in four sets. His best singles performance at a Grand Slam tournament came in 1973 when he reached the final of the French Open but lost to Ilie N\u0103stase in three straight sets. Pili\u0107 was the catalyst to the 1973 Wimbledon boycott. In May of that year, the Yugoslav tennis federation alleged that Pili\u0107 had refused to represent them in a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand earlier that month. Pili\u0107 denied the charge, but was suspended by the federation, and the suspension was upheld by the ILTF, albeit decreased from nine months to one month, meaning that he could not enter the Wimbledon Championships. In protest at the suspension, 81 of Pili\u0107's fellow professionals, organized into the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and including 13 of the 16 seeds, withdrew from the 1973 Wimbledon Championships. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)=== {| class='sortable wikitable' !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:150px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:170px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:140px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" |style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1973 || French Open || Clay || Ilie N\u0103stase || 3\u20136, 3\u20136, 0\u20136 |} ===Doubles: 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:150px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:170px\"|Partner !style=\"width:170px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:140px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" |style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1962 || Wimbledon || Grass || Boro Jovanovi\u0107 || Bob Hewitt Fred Stolle || 2\u20136, 7\u20135, 2\u20136, 4\u20136 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1970 || US Open|| Grass || Pierre Barth\u00e8s || Roy Emerson Rod Laver || 6\u20133, 7\u20136, 4\u20136, 7\u20136 |} ==Grand Slam singles performance timeline== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Tournament !!1960 !!1961 !!1962 !!1963 !!1964 !!1965 !!1966 !!1967 !!1968 !!1969 !!1970 !!1971 !!1972 !!1973 !!1974 !!1975 !!1976 !!colspan=2|1977 !!1978!! |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef| Australian Open | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 3 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef| French Open | A | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | A | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | A | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | A | bgcolor=thistle|F | A | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | A | bgcolor=afeeee colspan=2|1R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 11 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef| Wimbledon | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | A | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=yellow|SF | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=afeeee|2R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee colspan=2|3R | A | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 15 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef| US Open | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | A | A | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | A | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | A | A | A | colspan=2|A | A | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 9 |- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#efefef;\" | style=text-align:left|Strike rate | 0 / 1 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 4 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 1 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 3 | 0 / 3 | 0 / 4 | 0 / 1 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 1 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 1 | colspan=2|0 / 2 | 0 / 1 | |} Note: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December. ==Post-playing== After retiring from playing tennis professionally, Pili\u0107 began coaching and became the first captain to win the Davis Cup trophy for three nations: Germany in 1988, 1989 and 1993, Croatia in 2005 and Serbia in 2010.
