This plant was cited as Hovea Celsi in Description des plantes rares cultivees a Malmaison et a Navarre by Aim\u00e9 Jacques Alexandre Bonpland. ==Description== The erect and slender shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of It is usually single stemmed and the young branches are covered in spreading often rust coloured hairs. The stipules are narrow triangular and around in length. The alternately arranged leaves have an elliptical blade to around in length. The species has purple or blue flowers that appear between August and December in its native range. The pea shaped flowers are arranged in short clusters among the leaf axils. The axillary inflorescences contain one to seven flowers. The seed pods that form later are ovoid to ellipsoid in shape and are in length and wide. The olive brown seeds within have an elliptic shape and in length and wide. ==Taxonomy== The species was first formally in 1808 as Poiretia elliptica by James Edward Smith in 1808 in the work Characters of Platylobium, Bossiaea and of a new Genus named Poiretia as published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. It was later transferred to the genus Hovea by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1825 in the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Numerous synonyms are known including Goodia simplicifolia as described by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel in 1827, Phusicarpos elliptica by Jean Louis Marie Poiret in 1816 and Platychilum celsianum by Jean-Claude Michel Mornant de Launay in 1819. ==Distribution== It occurs on sand dunes, slopes ridges and granite outcrops in the South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in clay, loamy, sandy and gravelly lateritic soils often rich in organic matter. Usually part of the understorey in jarrah, marri and karri forest communities and is often associated with Bossiaea aquifolium subsp. laidlawiana and Hovea chorizemifolia. ==Cultivation== It is sold commercially as seedlings or in seed form, the seeds germinate readily but need to be scarified or pre-treated with boiling water. The plant prefers well-drained soils and an open sunny or partly shaded position. It is drought tolerant but frost tender. ==References== * * * ==External links== *National Library of Australia Hovea celsi paint elliptica Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1825 Category:Taxa named by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle ",
