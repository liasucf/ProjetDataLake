    "text": "In topology, Lebesgue's number lemma, named after Henri Lebesgue, is a useful tool in the study of compact metric spaces. It states: :If the metric space (X, d) is compact and an open cover of X is given, then there exists a number \\delta > 0 such that every subset of X having diameter less than \\delta is contained in some member of the cover. Such a number \\delta is called a Lebesgue number of this cover. The notion of a Lebesgue number itself is useful in other applications as well. == Proof == Let \\mathcal U be an open cover of X. Since X is compact we can extract a finite subcover \\\\{A_1, \\dots, A_n\\\\} \\subseteq \\mathcal U. If any one of the A_i's equals X then any \\delta > 0 will serve as a Lebesgue number. Otherwise for each i \\in \\\\{1, \\dots, n\\\\}, let C_i := X \\setminus A_i, note that C_i is not empty, and define a function f : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb R by f(x) := \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n d(x,C_i). Since f is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum \\delta. The key observation is that, since every x is contained in some A_i, the extreme value theorem shows \\delta > 0. Now we can verify that this \\delta is the desired Lebesgue number. If Y is a subset of X of diameter less than \\delta, then there exists x_0\\in X such that Y\\subseteq B_\\delta(x_0), where B_\\delta(x_0) denotes the ball of radius \\delta centered at x_0 (namely, one can choose x_0 as any point in Y). Since f(x_0)\\geq \\delta there must exist at least one i such that d(x_0,C_i)\\geq \\delta. But this means that B_\\delta(x_0)\\subseteq A_i and so, in particular, Y\\subseteq A_i. ==References== * Category:Theorems in topology Category:Lemmas ",
