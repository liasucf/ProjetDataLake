    "text": "The Supreme Economic Council was established at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 to advise the conference on economic measures to be taken pending the negotiation of peace. Specialized commissions were appointed to study particular problems: the organization of a League of Nations and the drafting of its Covenant; and the determination of responsibility for the war and guarantees. ==Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief== The Allied Maritime Transport Council (AMTC) had been established in 1917 to co-ordinate the tight control of all shipping of the Allies of World War I. Even prior to the armistice of 11 November 1918 the Allied Maritime Transport Council had been making preparations for changes to introduce in the event of fighting ceasing. In particular they had sent a proposal that German and Austrian ships should be placed under their control as part of the armistice agreement \u2013 however they did not succeed in this. By 13 November, two days after the armistice, the British government proposed to their counterparts in France, Italy and the United States that the AMTC be transformed into a \"General Economic Council\". However the American government wanted the previous organisation to be discontinued, with a new organisation being set up to deal with such economic problems as arose. After discussion amongst the parties involved an agreement to set up the Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief was reached on 12 December 1918, with the organisation holding its first meeting on 11 January 1919, a week before the actual Paris Peace Conference opened. By the beginning of February the Supreme Economic Council had been established by merging the Allied Maritime Transport Council with the barely established Allied Supreme Council of Supply and Relief and the Inter- Allied Food Council and the Superior Blockade Council. ==References== http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/574865/Supreme-Economic-Council Category:Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920) Category:Aftermath of World War I ",
