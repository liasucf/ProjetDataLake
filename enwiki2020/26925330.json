    "text": "Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (abbreviated JPA) was a Western Aramaic language spoken by the Jews during the Classic Era in Judea and the Levant, specifically in Hasmonean, Herodian and Roman Judea and adjacent lands in the late first millennium BCE and later in Syria Palaestina and Palaestina Secunda in the early first millennium CE. A dialect of this language (Galilean Aramaic) was spoken by Jesus. The Son of God Text (4Q246), found in Qumran is written in this language as well. There were some differences in dialect between Judea and Galilee, and most surviving texts are in the Galilean dialect: Michael Sokoloff has published separate dictionaries of the two dialects. ==Overview== After the defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, the center of Jewish learning in the land of Israel moved to Galilee. Following the Arab conquest of the country in the 7th century, Arabic gradually replaced this language. The most notable text in this dialect's corpus is the Jerusalem Talmud, which is still studied in Jewish religious schools and academically, although not as widely as the Babylonian Talmud, most of which is written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. There are some older texts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, notably the Megillat Taanit: the Babylonian Talmud contains occasional quotations from these. Many extant manuscripts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic have been corrupted over the years of their transmission by Eastern Aramaic-speaking scribes freely correcting \"errors\" they came across (these \"errors\" actually being genuine Jewish Palestinian Aramaic features). To date, all formal grammars of the dialect fall victim to these corruptions, and there is still no published syntax. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Sokoloff, Michael, A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period, 2nd ed.: Johns Hopkins 2002/3 and Ramat Gan 2002 * Category:Aramaic languages Category:Establishments in the Hasmonean Kingdom Category:Extinct languages of Asia Category:Jewish languages Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire Category:Judeo-Aramaic languages Category:Liturgical languages Category:Talmud Category:Western Aramaic languages ",
