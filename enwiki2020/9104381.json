    "text": "Ghost Stories is an American horror anthology television series that ran from 1997 to 1998 on The Family Channel. The show was narrated by Rip Torn and originally two episodes were presented back to back in an hour-long segment. However, towards the end of the series, it was broken down into 30 minute episodes with just one story, most featuring a style similar to episodes of The Twilight Zone in which there would be a twist at the end. There have been five DVD releases. Also, Ghost Stories episodes are currently being shown in the United Kingdom on the TV channel Zone Horror. ==Episodes== Each episode begins with an introduction segment narrated by Rip Torn (viewable in QuickTime or in Windows Media): > Come with me to a place of wondrous contradictions. A place that is silent > and unstirring yet restless and alive. A place of untold peace and boundless > dread. Come with me into the very cradle of darkness, where those who dwell, > dwell alone. Once complete, it goes directly into the episode where Rip Torn introduces the episode. During the episode's conclusion, Rip Torn comments on what was seen (usually in some form of a moral). ==Home releases== ===Volume sets=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name!!Release date!!Ep #!!Additional information |- |Ghost Stories||December 7, 2004|| align=\"center\" |40||5-disc DVD set released by Platinum Disc Corporation, presented in a digipak format with no bonus features or commentary; excludes 4 episodes; \"It's Only A Movie\", \"At Death's Door\", \"Going Down\", and \"Cabin Fever\". |- |Ghost Stories: Volume 1||August 23, 2005|| align=\"center\" |8||Run-time of 165 minutes and is basically a repackaged version of disc 1 from the box set above; followed by Ghost Stories, Vol. 2, which is disc 2 from the box set above. |- |Ghost Stories: 6-disc set||September 30, 2008|| align=\"center\" |44||The complete series was released in a 6-disc set, including the 4 never-before-seen episodes; comes in a new digipack with the same 5 volumes and a 6th disc including the 4 never-before-released episodes; released on region 1 with no other bonus features. |- |Haunted: Ghost Stories||October 6, 2009|| align=\"center\" |40||The 40-episode set was re-released in a 2-disc keepcase featuring new cover art and bearing the title: Haunted: Ghost Stories; each disc is dual-sided and contains 10 episodes of the series as opposed to 8; presented in a standard DVD case and includes no bonus features. |- |Ghost Stories \u2013 The Complete Series||April 10, 2012|| align=\"center\" |44||The complete series was re-released in a 4-disc set by Timeless Media Group. |} ===Complete set=== On September 30, 2008, the complete series was released in a 6-disc set, including the 4 never-before-seen episodes.
