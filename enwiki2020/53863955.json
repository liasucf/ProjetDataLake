    "text": "Fung Mei Wai (), formerly Kau Shi Wai (, literally dog shit walled (village)), is a village in Fung Yuen, Tai Po, Hong Kong. == Name change == In 2013, the Lands Department's Geographical Place Names Board recommended changing the name of the village. The proposal followed a letter from a Tai Po Fung Yuen village representative, who complained that Kau Shi Wai () was indecent and could cause embarrassment. The Tai Po District Council voted in favour of the name change by 10 votes to 0, with 5 abstentions. The new name, Fung Mei Wai (), was officially adopted in January 2014. Signposts and the Lands Department's GeoInfo Map were subsequently updated to reflect the change. == See also == * Shitterton ==References== Category:Tai Po District Category:Populated places in Hong Kong ",
