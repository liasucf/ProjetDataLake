    "text": "The O. Henry House Museum is a historic house museum located in San Antonio, Texas. It is named for the American writer, William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry who lived in the house in 1885. ==History== The O. Henry House museum was initially built by John Kush, a German settler in 1855. The house, built in adobe brick, was originally located at 904 South Presa street. In the early 1880s, William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry moved to San Antonio and rented the two room house for $6 a month. Porter lived here from 1885 to 1886. In 1959, the San Antonio Conservation Society, working with both the Lone Star Brewing Company and the descendants of John Kush, the original owner, purchased the home for a symbolic one dollar. This included the responsibility of moving the home within 60 days to save it from demolition. It was moved to the location of the Lone Star Brewing Company where it was part of the Buckhorn museum collection until the breweries closure in 1997. In 1998, David Carter and the MLP partnership moved the house once more, this time to its present location at the corner of Dolorosa and Laredo Street in Downtown San Antonio. It re-opened as a museum in 1999. ==Works Written Here== While living here, Porter wrote several short stories set in San Antonio. These included Fog in Santone, The Higher Abdication, and Hygeia at the Solito. ==See also== *William Sidney Porter House *List of museums in Central Texas *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Bexar County ==References== ==External links== *History of the Home and Porter's Time in San Antonio Category:Museums in San Antonio Category:Houses in San Antonio Category:Historic house museums in Texas Category:Houses completed in 1855 Category:O.
