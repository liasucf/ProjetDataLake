Different languages use different terms for citizens of the United States, who are known in English as Americans. All forms of English refer to US citizens as Americans, a term deriving from the United States of America, the country's official name. In the English context, it came to refer to inhabitants of British North America, and then the United States.

Martin Waldseem\u00fcller coined the term America (in honor of Vespucci) in a 1507 world map. First uses of the adjective American referenced European settlements in the New World. Americans referred to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and subsequently to European settlers and their descendants. English use of the term American for people of European descent dates to the 17th century, with the earliest recorded appearance being in Thomas Gage's The English-American: A New Survey of the West Indies in 1648.
