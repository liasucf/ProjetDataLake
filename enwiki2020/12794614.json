I think he knew it was at times a stressful experience for me because initially when you write songs and do demos you\u2019re so used to the rawness of each song, it\u2019s hard to go through the production stage and get used to hearing your songs with a massive sound behind them. Once that\u2019s done it\u2019s so rewarding hearing the final product come together\". Szumowski states \"This is an album of strong songs with strong melodies. There are no production tricks, just an old school way of doing the songs service. Candice writes melodies which become imbedded in your mind after three listens\". ==Track listing== # \"I Belong\" (Alley) \u2013 3:36 # \"Hopeless\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Before You Go\" (Alley) \u2013 3:53 # \"Drifting\" \u2013 4:02 # \"Every Time\" \u2013 3:50 # \"World Keeps Turning\" \u2013 3:28 # \"That I Would\" (Alley, Grant Hackett) \u2013 3:08 # \"To Find You\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Yesterday\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Better Off\" \u2013 3:54 ==References== Category:2007 albums ",
