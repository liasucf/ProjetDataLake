The Cora rocket served for component testing for the planned Europa Rocket, which was eventually built by the European Launcher Development Organisation, the predecessor to the modern European Space Agency. The first stage of the Cora was 5.5 metres long and had a diameter of 2 metres. It weighed with fuel 9.85 tons. The entire rocket had a length of 11.5 metres and a takeoff weight of 16.5 tonnes. It was powered by a three-nozzle engine that provided 220 KN of thrust and had a specific impulse (in vacuum) of 280 seconds. A cylindrical black ring supporting four fins was attached to the rocket's base. The Cora was launched on 27 November 1966 and on 18 December 1966 from the CIEES missile range and launch facility at Hammaguir, French Algeria. The December launch was successful. On 25 October 1967 a further launch took place from Biscarosse, which failed. The Cora was the largest rocket ever launched in Western Europe. ==References== Category:Experimental rockets Category:Space launch vehicles of France ",
