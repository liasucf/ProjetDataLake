Sastry (Telugu: \u0c2c\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c38\u0c41 \u0c1c\u0c17\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c25 \u0c36\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f, IAST: Bulusu Jagann\u0101tha \u015a\u0101stri) was a prominent electrical engineer and philanthropist from Yanam before Independence of French India. ==Birth== He was born around c.1912 to Bouloussou Soubramaniom Sastroulou (\u0c38\u0c41\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c39\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c23\u0c4d\u0c2f \u0c36\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41, Subrahma\u1e47ya\u015b\u0101strulu) and Souryapracasamma (\u0c38\u0c42\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c36\u0c2e\u0c4d\u0c2e S\u016bryaprak\u0101\u015bamma) as their eldest son . He belongs to Bouloussou family of Yanam and his father being a prominent politician during French colonial rule in Yanam in the early 20th century. He was named after his paternal grandfather Zagannadha Sastroulou. His maternal uncle was Kala Venkata Rao, a freedom fighter, and former minister of Madras state and Andhra Pradesh. B. J. Sastry is influenced by Indian nationalism due to his uncle and Bengali Renaissance due his stay at Bengal for many decades. So, he didn't retake his French nationality when such an option was given after 1962 Independence of French India. He was a polyglot and could speak around 8 languages (Telugu, French, English, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, and Sanskrit). ==Education== Owing to political disturbances in French Yanam in early 20th century, he had his primary and secondary education at nearby Amalapuram town in Konaseema region with the support of his uncle Kala Venkata Rao. Later, he pursued his Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (B.E.E.) at The National Council of Education, Bengal, now known as Jadavpur University. During that time he obtained accommodation at Nalam choultry (\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c33\u0c02 \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c02) on recommendation of his father Soubramanion Sastroulou. That choultry established by Nalam Krishna Rao at Calcutta. ==Marriage== He married Annapurna (n\u00e9e Mangipudi), daughter of a Mangipudi Zamindar at Peddapuram during circa 1942 at Muramalla within the Veereswaraswamy temple.

However, the couple had no children. ==Career== It so happened that he lost his degree. So, instead for asking for a duplicate degree, he had obtained an equivalent degree, i.e. Associate member (AMIE) on 29 December 1950 at Institution of Engineers (India). He was among one the earliest life members of the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) (at least since 1952).http://www.sciencecongress.nic.in/pdf/life_members/LM_2019_2020.zip ISCA is a premier scientific organisation of India with headquarters at Kolkata, West Bengal.
