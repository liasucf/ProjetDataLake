    "text": "Frances Crofts Cornford (n\u00e9e Darwin; 30 March 1886 \u2013 19 August 1960) was an English poet; because of the similarity of her first name, her father's and her husband's, she was known to her family before her marriage as \"FCD\" and after her marriage as \"FCC\" and her husband Francis Cornford was known as \"FMC\". Her father Sir Francis Darwin, a son of Charles Darwin, yet another 'Francis', was known to their family as \"Frank\", or as \"Uncle Frank\". ==Life== She was the daughter of the botanist Francis Darwin and Newnham College fellow Ellen Wordsworth Crofts (1856-1903), and born into the Darwin\u2014Wedgwood family. She was a granddaughter of the British naturalist Charles Darwin. Her older half-brother was the golf writer Bernard Darwin. She was brought up in Cambridge, among a dense social network of aunts, uncles, and cousins, and was educated privately.Period Piece, a memoir by Frances Cornford's first cousin and close friend, Gwen Raverat, sheds much light on Cornford's childhood. In 1909, Frances Darwin married Francis Cornford, a classicist and poet. They had five children: * Helena Cornford (1913\u20131996); married Joseph L. HendersonJeremy Pearce, \"Joseph L. Henderson, 104; Expanded Jungian Methods\", The New York Times. in 1934 *John Cornford (1915\u20131936), a poet and Communist who was killed in the Spanish Civil War *Christopher Cornford (1917\u20131993), an artist and writer * Hugh Wordsworth Cornford (1921\u20131997), medical doctorFlora Bridge \u00b7 Barrie Alfred Ernest Chapman \u00b7 Amiya Kumar Chatterjee \u00b7 Hugh Wordsworth Cornford... - Europe PMC Article - Europe PubMed Central * Ruth Clare (1924\u20131992); married Cecil Hall Chapman, the son of Sydney Chapman in 1947.Marriages The Times, Friday, 11 April 1947; p. 1; Issue 50732; col A. She was the mother of Matthew Chapman She is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge,Mark Goldie, A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge, pp. 62 and 63 (2009). where she is in the same grave as her father Sir Francis Darwin. Her mother Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, n\u00e9e Crofts, is buried in St. Andrews Church's churchyard in Girton, Cambridgeshire. Her husband, Francis, was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 6 January 1943. ==Works== Frances Cornford published several books of verse, including her debut (as \"F.C.D\"), The Holtbury Idyll (1908), Poems (1910), Spring Morning (1915), Autumn Midnight (1923), and Different Days (1928). Mountains and Molehills (1935) was illustrated with woodcuts by her cousin Gwen Raverat. She wrote poems including \"The Guitarist Tunes Up\": > With what attentive courtesy he bent Over his instrument; Not as a lordly > conqueror who could Command both wire and wood, But as a man with a loved > woman might Inquiring with delight What slight essential things she had to > say Before they started, he and she, to play. One of Frances Cornford's poems was a favourite of Philip Larkin and his lover Maeve Brennan. \"All Souls' Night\" uses the superstition that a dead lover will appear to a still faithful partner on that November date. Maeve, many years after Larkin's death, would re-read the poem on All Souls: > My love came back to me Under the November tree Shelterless and dim. He put > his hand upon my shoulder, He did not think me strange or older, Nor I him. Although the myth enhances the poem - it can be read as the meeting of older, former lovers. To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train However, Cornford is possibly best remembered for her triolet poem \"To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train\" in Poems of 1910. > O why do you walk through the fields in gloves, Missing so much and so much? > O fat white woman whom nobody loves, Why do you walk through the fields in > gloves, When the grass is soft as the breast of doves And shivering-sweet to > the touch? O why do you walk through the fields in gloves, Missing so much > and so much? To which G. K. Chesterton replied in \"The Fat Lady Answers\" in his Collected Poems of 1927: > Why do you rush through the field in trains, Guessing so much and so much. > Why do you flash through the flowery meads, Fat-head poet that nobody reads; > And why do you know such a frightful lot About people in gloves as such? ... Earlier, in 1910, A. E. Housman had written a parody in a private letter: > O why do you walk through the fields in boots, Missing so much and so much? > O fat white woman whom nobody shoots, Why do you walk through the fields in > boots, When the grass is soft as the breast of coots ... The first lines of this poem were spoken by a character in Agatha Christie's 1939 novel Murder is Easy. ==See also== *Conduit Head ==Notes== ==External links== * * *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica *Bibliography *The Coast: Norfolk by Frances Cornford * * Archival Material at Category:1886 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family Category:English women poets Category:Burials in Cambridgeshire Category:20th-century English poets Category:20th-century English women writers ",
