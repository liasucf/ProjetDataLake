    "text": "Gottfried Gr\u00fcnewald (also Grunewald; baptised 15 October 1673 \u2013 19 or 20 December 1739) was a German operatic bass, harpsichordist and composer. == Life == Gr\u00fcnewald was baptised in Seifhennersdorf near Zittau, on 15 October 1673. He is supposed to have studied law at the University of Leipzig. From 1703 he was a bass singer and composer at the Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt in Hamburg. Two of his operas were performed there with him in the title roles, in 1704 Der ungetreue Sch\u00e4fer Cardillo, and in 1705 Germanicus which had received its world premiere in Leipzig the previous year. From 1709, he worked as vice kapellmeister at the court of Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, where he married Johanna Rosina Krieger, the daughter of Johann Philipp Krieger. From 1711, he held the same position at the court in Darmstadt, with Kapellmeister Christoph Graupner. Around 1717, several journeys are documented as a pantalon virtuoso. Of his compositions, only seven partitas for harpsichord survived, written in the style of the period. Everything else is lost, possibly on the orders of Graupner's successor, or on the composer's request. Gr\u00fcnewald died in Darmstadt. == Further reading == * Wilibald Nagel: Gottfried Gr\u00fcnewald. In Sammelb\u00e4nde der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft, 12th year, issue. 1.
