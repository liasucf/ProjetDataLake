Focusing on the subject of modern slavery in the sex trade, the film, starring Anca Dumitra and Allen Leech, is based upon the novel Slave by Jason Johnson, published on 3 May 2018.https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1785038982/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_4?smid=A7CL6GT0UVQKS&psc;=1 The film documents the story of 'Ana', a Romanian student training to be a nurse who is kidnapped in broad daylight from the streets of London and ordered to work as a prostitute in a number of brothels in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Casting for the film was announced in August 2018. The film was broadcast as part of the BBC's Why Slavery? season, to coincide with International Anti Slavery Day. ==Casting== Anca Dumitra said of her role as Ana; \u201cAna is a truly remarkable person, someone who has survived endless abuse with courage and determination, a real-life hero. I have been deeply moved by her story and it\u2019s an honour to play her in Doing Money. This is a story that needs to be seen.\u201d Allen Leech added; \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be part of telling this moving and important true story. Doing Money, Ana\u2019s experience, shines a light on the shocking truth of human trafficking and slavery in Britain. DI Dougie Grant was one of the key officers at the centre of the original investigation. It\u2019s a real privilege to play him.\u201d ==Reception== Alison Graham of the Radio Times wrote; \"After watching Gwyneth Hughes\u2019s fact-based drama Doing Money, I went home stifled by a cloud of misery that couldn\u2019t be dispersed, even by the repeats of ancient Big Bang Theories I watched long into the evening just to try to flush the horror from my system. I found Doing Money so overwhelming \u2013 the true story of Ana, a young Romanian woman working as a cleaner in Britain who was abducted by a trafficking gang from a street in Wood Green London and forced into sex slavery. I was harrowed as she was repeatedly brutalised into submission by a series of men who treated her savagely.\" Viewers described the film as \"horrific\", \"disturbing\", \"harrowing\" and \"heartbreaking.\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-11-06/doing-money- bbc2-reaction/ ==Cast== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s British crime television series Category:2010s British drama television series Category:BBC high definition shows Category:BBC television dramas Category:British crime drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in London Category:Television shows set in Ireland ",
