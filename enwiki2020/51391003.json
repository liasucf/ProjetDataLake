    "text": "Kevin Donald Lustig (born 23 August 1963) is a male American scientist and entrepreneur and founder of three life science companies: the pharmaceutical company Kalypsys in 2001; the online research marketplace Scientist.com (formerly Assay Depot) in 2007; and the non-profit lab incubator Bio, Tech and Beyond in 2013. ==Education== Lustig received an A.B. degree, magna cum laude, from the Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology from Cornell University in 1985. He received an M.S. degree in Biochemistry from the University of Missouri in 1991 and a PhD degree from Marc Kirschner\u2019s laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco in 1997. Lustig carried out postdoctoral research in the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School in 1997. ==Scientific contributions== Lustig has published 25 original research articles and 4 book chapters and is an inventor of 8 patents. In 1993, Lustig and Andrew Shiau cloned the first member of a novel class of Purinergic receptors activated by extracellular ATP, a gene family that includes important drug targets. In 1993, Lustig and Bruce Conklin invented the first of a series of G-protein chimeras that are still widely used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for drug screening. In 1996, Lustig and Marc Kirschner invented a paracrine signaling assay and used it to identify Xnr1, which is part of a cell signaling pathway generating left-right asymmetry. In 1997, Lustig and Randy King invented an in vitro expression cloning technology used to isolate substrates of kinases and proteases. In 1997, Lustig invented a functional genomics approach to gene discovery and used it to identify a new member of the T-box family of transcription factors (Xombi aka VegT). In 1999 and 2000, Lustig and colleagues showed that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), invented synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, and demonstrated that both FXR and LXR ligands regulate cholesterol transport. ==Entrepreneurial career== Lustig served as a research director at the biotechnology company Tularik, Inc. from 1997 to 2001, before it being acquired by Amgen in 2004. Tularik went public in December 1999 and is credited with helping to start the biotechnology stock bubble of 2000. Lustig, Randy King, Pratik Shah and Peter Schultz founded the pharmaceutical company Kalypsys, Inc. in 2001. The company was a pioneer in using high throughput screening (HTS) for phenotypic drug screens. The company raised over $170M in venture capital funding. The HTS part of the business was sold to Panasonic in 2006. In 2007, Lustig, Chris Petersen, and Andrew Martin founded the research marketplace Assay Depot (later Scientist.com). The company launched its first public marketplace in September 2008. By 2020, the company operated private marketplaces for most of the world\u2019s major pharmaceutical companies and US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Lustig and Joseph Jackson founded Bio, Tech and Beyond (BTNB), a non-profit life science incubator in Carlsbad, California in 2013; BTNB is a fully equipped shared research facility that makes it possible for one or a few scientists to start a life science company without significant funding. ==Recognition== In 2013, Lustig was named \u201cSan Diego\u2019s Most Admired CEO\u201d by the San Diego Business Journal. That same year he was also one of five national finalists for Entrepreneur magazine's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year Award. In 2013, Lustig was named \u201cSan Diego\u2019s Most Admired CEO\u201d by the San Diego Business Journal, and that same year he was one of five national finalists for Entrepreneur magazine\u2019s Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year Award. Lustig was twice recognized as one of the life science industry\u2019s \u201c100 Most Inspiring People\u201d by PharmaVoice magazine in 2012 and 2013. The company also won the San Diego Business Journal\u2019s 2014 Innovation Award. In 2015, 2018, and 2019, the company was named one of Entrepreneur magazine\u2019s Best Entrepreneurial Companies in America. From 2017-2019, Scientist.com ranked no. 155, 9, and 289, respectively on Inc. magazine\u2019s list of the 500 Fastest-Growing privately-owned companies in America. Scientist.com also made Inc. magazine's list of Best Workplaces of 2018 and 2019. Scientist.com was ranked by San Diego Business Journal as the 2nd Fastest-Growing Private Company in 2018 and the 10th Fastest-Growing Private Company in 2019. In 2020, Lustig was named one San Diego's Most Influential People by the San Diego Business Journal. ==Notes and references== Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:American scientists ",
