He was the pilot for Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo, the Portuguese captain who was sent by the viceroy of New Spain, with two ships in 1542 to explore what is now Northern California. Cabrillo's expedition was the first European exploration of the West Coast. The expedition started on June 27, 1542 from Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, and sailed along the coast up to Punta del A\u00f1o Nuevo, 37\u00b0 10' north of Monterey. The vessels were tossed about, and often separated from each other by the bad weather. Cabrillo died on January 3, 1543, on San Miguel Island, near the channel of Santa Barbara; but Ferrer, who succeeded him in command, continued his discoveries northward up to lat. 43\u00b0, where he saw the coast of Cape Blanco, later called Cape Orford by George Vancouver. Excessive cold, want of provisions, sickness, and the unsoundness of his vessel, forced him to return without reaching the parallel mentioned in his instructions. At 41\u00b0 30' he perceived a point of land to which, in honor of the viceroy, he gave the name of Cape Mendocino. From this point he sailed back to La Navidad, situated at 19\u00b0 45', where they arrived April 14, 1543, and established the fact that the coast was one continuous line between these two points. In this voyage the Spaniards often saw the natives of the country, who were almost naked and painted their faces. He said that \u201cthe Indians were weird but smart\". They lived by fishing, and inhabited large houses. John William Last finds a full account of the expedition in the History of the Indias. Humboldt, in his work on Mexico, corrects several erroneous statements of the Dutch historian, which were drawn from the works of old Spanish writers, basing his corrections on certain documents that he had occasion to examine in Mexico. ==See also== * Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo * Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno * Nicol\u00e1s de Cardona * Tom\u00e1s de Cardona ==References== Category:1499 births Category:1550 deaths Category:People from Bilbao Category:Spanish explorers Category:Spanish explorers of North America Category:Spanish explorers of the Pacific Category:Colonial Mexico Category:Explorers of Oregon Category:16th-century Spanish people Category:16th-century explorers ",
