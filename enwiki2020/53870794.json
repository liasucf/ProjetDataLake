    "text": "Coat of arms of the House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, the Brazilian imperial family The movement for the re-adoption of monarchy in Brazil has taken place as a series of uprisings and political acts, usually in a fragmented way and peripherally to larger causes. It has been important historically and remains an fast-growing active movement to this day. It advocates restoration of the constitutional monarchy under the House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, a cadet branch of the House of Braganza, which ruled Brazil for 67 years (the Empire of Brazil) until the monarchy was abolished in 1889 by a military coup d'\u00e9tat. ==History== The flag of the Empire of Brazil is widely used by Brazilian monarchists After the 1889 coup d'\u00e9tat that ended the imperial rule and established a republic in Brazil, the first monarchist nucleus began to form. Under the republican rule, they were a minority and initially even illegal. In 1890, the Brazilian Monarchical Directory was founded by Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto, the last Prime Minister of the Empire of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. Its main objective was to organise the country's royalists and to report directly with the exiled Brazilian Imperial Family. ===Monarchist uprisings=== The Revolta da Armada was a rebel movement promoted by units of the Brazilian Navy against the dictatorial government of Floriano Peixoto, supposedly supported by the monarchist opposition to the recent installation of the republic.Smallman; Shall C. Fear & Memory in the Brazilian Army & Society, 1889\u20131954 The University of North Carolina Press 2002 Page 20 2nd paragraph It was part of the Federalist Riograndense Revolution, led by the monarchist Gaspar da Silveira Martins, one of the last ministers of the Empire of Brazil, who was disaffected by Deodoro da Fonseca. The Canudos War was the confrontation between the Brazilian Army and the members of a popular movement of socio-religious background led by Antonio Conselheiro that lasted from 1896 to 1897, in the community of Canudos, Bahia. The great farmers of the region, joining the Church, formed a strong pressure group against the newly installed republic, asking that measures be taken against Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro and his followers. Rumors were created that Canudos was armed to attack neighbouring towns and leave for the capital to depose the republican government and reinstall the monarchy.Levine, R.M. Vale of Tears: Revisiting the Canudos Massacre in Northeastern Brazil, 1893\u20131897. University of California Press, 1995 Another little known event was the Revolt of Ribeir\u00e3ozinho, a conservative movement that occurred in the city of Ribeir\u00e3ozinho (now Taquaritinga), in S\u00e3o Paulo. Its fundamental objective was the restoration of the monarchy and the coronation of Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, son of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. Unhappy with the First Brazilian Republic, the S\u00e3o Paulo monarchists had planned an uprising that was supposed to take place on 23 August 1902, and which was to topple then President Campos Sales. In fact, the uprising had only been carried out in Ribeir\u00e3ozinho and Esp\u00edrito Santo do Pinhal, a neighbouring town. This attempt to restore the monarchy lasted one day. Founded in 1928, the Brazilian Imperial Patrianovist Action, or simply Patrianovism, was a monarchist organisation present in several Brazilian states that expressed the nationalist and authoritarian ideas of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Idealised by Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, it aimed to establish a new monarchy in Brazil, based on a conservative political philosophy. The movement was linked to Prince Pedro Henrique of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, then Head of the Imperial House of Brazil and heir to the throne, as well as Pl\u00ednio Salgado, leader and founder of the Brazilian Integralist Action. ==Famous monarchists== Eduardo Prado was a journalist and staunch monarchist who wrote, in 1893, A Ilus\u00e3o Americana (\"American Illusion\"), criticising republicans and American imperialism. It was the first literary work to be censored by the newly established republic. Many famous personalities in Brazil have declared themselves convicted monarchists. Among the most famous names are Machado de Assis, Joaquim Nabuco, Baron of Rio Branco, Andr\u00e9 Rebou\u00e7as, Viscount of Taunay, Jo\u00e3o Camilo de Oliveira Torres, Carlos de Laet and Count of Mota Maia. Some royalists, however, were victims of the republican regime. Among them is Jos\u00e9 da Costa Azevedo, the Baron of Ladario, who was shot by an unknown marksman for resisting an arrest warrant during 15 November, surviving only because a student, Carlos Vieira Ferreira, rescued him. Another little known case is the murder of Colonel Gentil de Castro during the Canudos War. Owner of the monarchist newspapers Gazeta da Tarde and Gazeta da Liberdade, he was shot by unknown attackers in Rio de Janeiro.

Facebook pages like Pr\u00f3 Monarquia reached almost 100,000 followers and are a point of convergence between different branches of Brazilian monarchism. According to LA Times, the level of support has remained fairly steady with 10.3% in the 1993 referendum and 10.7% in a 2017 survey by pollster Paran\u00e1 Pesquisas. The members of the Brazilian Imperial Family are becoming increasingly known. Prince Jo\u00e3o Henrique of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, known as Dom Jo\u00e3ozinho, is one of the most popular figures in Paraty, where he has an inn, and is always invited to give interviews to various media outlets, such as Folha de S.Paulo and the interview show Roda Viva. Prince Luiz Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, nephew of the current Head of the Imperial House of Brazil, is known in the Brazilian academical environment. He is an active member of liberal movements in the country. On 28 February, he announced his pre-candidacy to federal deputy for the state of S\u00e3o Paulo by the New Party. Prince Bertrand of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, Prince Imperial of Brazil and one of the heirs to the Brazilian throne, recently gave an interview to Mariana Godoy in her programme on RedeTV!, gaining notoriety with the public and being much honoured in the numerous demonstrations and congresses in which he participated. On 22 September 2017 Prince Bertrand participated in the programme The Noite com Danilo Gentili, currently the largest talk show in the country, breaking the programme's record of audience. Politically, the movement is still small. In 2016 journalist Paulo Eduardo Martins, known for his monarchist positions, was elected federal deputy. The movement now hopes to raise public awareness of the issue and discuss the possibility of a new plebiscite similar to the one of 1993. In early 2017, a legislative idea was launched on the website of the Federal Senate to hold a referendum on the restoration of the monarchy in Brazil. Needing 20,000 votes in favor, it reached the mark of 32,000 votes and was converted into a legislative suggestion, already sent to the Commission of Human Rights of the Brazilian Federal Senate for debate, awaiting a rapporteur. On 10 August 2017, a state deputy from Minas Gerais sent a motion of support to the legislative suggestion to the President of the Senate through the Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais, although this motion was not subject to a vote by the full membership of the assembly.https://www12.senado.leg.br/ecidadania/visualizacaomateria?id=129306 On 14 November 2017, the state of Rond\u00f4nia did the same by sending a motion to support the referendum proposal for the restoration of the monarchy to the federal senate through its legislative assembly. In August 2018, it was rumoured that Prince Luiz Philippe de Orl\u00e9ans-Braganca was going to be a vice- presidential candidate for right wing presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. == National \"Bandeira\u00e7o\" of the Independence == In 2015, some Brazilian monarchists started appearing with Brazil's imperial flag in military parades and similar events during Independence Day, an act known as the National \"Bandeira\u00e7o\" of Independence (bandeira\u00e7o may be translated as \"great flag demonstration\"). In 2016, the act was carried out nationally, in 16 cities. In 2017, 34 cities participated. The movement has received only minor support among the population, with only 9 demonstrators in the city of An\u00e1polis. National \"Bandeira\u00e7o\" of the Independence in An\u00e1polis, Goias, in 7 September 2017. ==Pretenders== The most recognised pretender to the Brazilian throne is Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza. He is the head of the called Vassouras branch of the Imperial Family, since it was divided after the resignation of his great-uncle Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, Prince of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 in 1908. The descendants of Prince Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara did not accept his resignation and maintained an active claim to the throne until the death of his elder son, Prince Pedro Gast\u00e3o of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza in 2007, whose claim passed to his son, Prince Pedro Carlos of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, head of the Petr\u00f3polis branch. ==Public opinion== There is no official research on public opinion regarding which form of government is preferred in Brazil. However, the emergence and growth of monarchist activity and organisations throughout the country is visible, especially in anti-government protests.In the midst of the political crisis, monarchists want emperor in Brazil Currently, according to an online poll conducted on the Brazilian Senate's website, 93% of the participants expressed support for a referendum on the restoration of the monarchy as a constitutional monarchy. This legislative suggestion has been terminally rejected by the legislative committee responsible for appraising it.92 percent of votes for a legislative suggestion that would restore the Brazilian monarchy {| class=\"wikitable\" !
