Parthiepan. == History == In 1999, during the making of Housefull, Parthiepan set up Bioscope Film Framers. He had previously made films with his ex-wife Seetha under the banner of Ammu Movies, but chose to begin a new studio after their separation. Alongside Parthiban, his children Abhinaya, Raakki and Keerthana have also been credited as producers under the banner. For the making of Kudaikul Mazhai, Parthiepan set up advertisement company called \"Gossip\" to take care of publicity in the print and electronic media. The studio's next film, Oththa Seruppu, will be the first Tamil film and the second Indian film to feature just a single actor throughout. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width: 82%; text-align: center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Language ! scope=\"col\" | Director ! scope=\"col\" | Cast ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Synopsis ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Housefull | 1999 | Tamil | | R.
