    "text": "The Canada Employment and Immigration Union (CEIU) is a Canadian labour union, with over 18,000 members in every Canadian Province and Territory. CEIU is affiliated with the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) and all CEIU members are automatically members of the PSAC. As affiliated, the PSAC is the bargaining agent for CEIU and other component unions for negotiations with the Treasury Board. CEIU is a member of the Program and Administrative Services (PA) group. Many of CEIUs 18,000 members work for the Federal Public Service within Service Canada / ESDC, IRCC and the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) as Immigration officers, Employment Insurance adjudicators, Program Services Delivery Clerks (PSDCs) and Service Canada Payment and/or Benefit Officers. == Structure == The membership is the cornerstone of CEIU. As such, there are over 200 locals across Canada. Each local administers its own affairs, elects its own officers and is responsible for the day-to-day relationship with local management. Every three years, CEIU holds their Triennial convention. This convention of CEIU delegates determines the union's policy on all matters affecting the members and their organization. The National President and the National Executive Vice-President are elected by delegates to the convention. Between conventions, the National Executive, headed by the National President and the National Executive Vice-President, is responsible for the affairs of the Union. The National Vice-Presidents (NVPs), representing eleven geographic regions, departmental or other constituencies (CIC, IRB, Women's issues, Human Rights), are elected by their respective members. == Staff == CEIU is the only component of the PSAC to have its own network of union offices across the country. National Union Representatives in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia work exclusively with CEIU members and their local leaders. National Union Representatives assist members with grievances and other issues, provide training, and help Locals to organize and maintain a strong union presence in the workplace. Staff at the union's national office in Ottawa carry out research, assist in consultation with senior management, and provide financial, clerical and administrative support. CEIU staff are represented by the Canadian Office & Professional Employees Union Local 225 which negotiates collective agreements on their behalf. == Executive == The current National Executive is: * Eddy Bourque \u2013 National President * Crystal Warner \u2013 Executive Vice-President * National Vice-President, BC/YT \u2013 Vanessa Miller * National Vice-President, Alberta, NorthWest Territories, and Nunavut \u2013 Michelle Henderson * National Vice President, Saskatchewan and Manitoba \u2013 Dwight McLeod * National Vice-President, Ontario \u2013 Travis Lahnalampi * National Vice- President, Ontario \u2013 Nicole Ma * National Vice-President, National Capital region \u2013 Jacques Perrin * National Vice-President, Quebec \u2013 Fabienne Jean- Fran\u00e7ois * National Vice-President, Quebec \u2013 Lyne Cartier * National Vice- President, Nova Scotia/Newfoundland and Labrador \u2013 Debbie Morris * National Vice-President, New Brunswick/PEI \u2013 Rhonda Rumson * National Vice-President for Women's Issues \u2013 Western Region \u2013 Lynda MacLellan * National Vice- President for Women's Issues \u2013 Eastern Region \u2013 Jodi MacPherson * National Vice-President for Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) \u2013 Marco Angeli * National Vice-President for Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) \u2013 Paul Croes * National Vice-President for Human Rights \u2013 Sebastian Rodrigues ==References== ==External links== * History of UI in Canada, since the 1930s * Canadian Government Site for EI * Canadian Government Site for Maternity and Parental Benefits * Library of Parliament publication on EI premiums * CBC Digital Archives \u2013 On The Dole: Employment Insurance in Canada Category:Trade unions in Canada Category:Public Service Alliance of Canada ",
