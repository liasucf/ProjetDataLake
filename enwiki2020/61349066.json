After a positive experience with Douglas, Thompson later approached wrestling manager Jim Cornette with an offer of $1,500 in exchange to come to his house and tell stories for a couple of hours. Before long, word spread, and with Douglas and Cornette vouching for him, numerous wrestling personalities agreed to meet and be interviewed by Thompson.https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/24514346/all-how-conrad-thompson- mortgage-guy-alabama-became-power-broker-pro-wrestling-podcast-empire- starrcast ===Ric Flair and Wooooo! Nation=== In 2013, Thompson met Ric Flair while he was appearing at a local event. Flair and Thompson hit it off, exchanged contact information and became friends. This led to Thompson occasionally travelling with Flair, meeting yet more wrestling personalities backstage at wrestling events, including Cody Rhodes. When CBS approached Flair about starting his own podcast, Flair asked Thompson, who had radio experience advertising his mortgage business to co-host. Flair's show (called Wooooo! Nation) followed a guest-driven format and Thompson met a great many professional wrestling personalities during this time, including Bruce Prichard. Eventually, Flair tired of podcasting, and Prichard agreed to launch a new show with Thompson. ===Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard=== Something to Wrestle eschews a more traditional podcast format, which Thompson describes as, \"Be under an hour, don't curse, don't play music, don't play all your ads up front.\" Thompson calls these, \"the standard rules of podcasting\" and routinely disregards them on the show, explaining that, \"I'm just a fan. But I also am the target demographic. If it's not something I'd listen to or be into, I don't do it.\" Typically the show revolves around a particular wrestling event or timeline such as a pay-per-view, memorable storyline angle or a wrestler's run in a certain promotion, with Thompson asking questions and Prichard giving his view on the subject. In 2018, Thompson and Prichard signed a deal with WWE to broadcast Something else to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard on the WWE Network.https://www.al.com/entertainment/2018/04/wrestling_podcast_king_conrad.html ==Starrcast== Starrcast is a professional wrestling fan convention promoted by Thompson. The event typically runs for four days\u2014 from Thursday to Sunday \u2013 and features wrestlers, wrestling personalities and podcast hosts, interviews, fan activities, and meet-and-greets. ==Personal life== Thompson resides in Huntsville, Alabama where he still operates his mortgage company.http://conradthompson.com/ He married his wife, Megan Fliehr, in 2018, becoming Ric Flair's son-in-law in the process. == References == Category:1981 births Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:Living people Category:Mortgage lenders ",
