    "text": "Santa Ana College is a public community college in Santa Ana, California. ==History== In 1915, Santa Ana Junior College opened its doors to 25 students as a department of Santa Ana High School. It was the second community college founded in Orange County, behind Fullerton College, and the fourth oldest in all of California. The 1933 Long Beach earthquake damaged the Santa Ana High School building, prompting the campus move to North Main Street where it remained until 1947. A bond issue passed in 1945, paving the way for development of a 48-acre (194,000 m\u00b2) campus at its current location. Santa Ana College plays host to Middle College High School, a small alternative high school in the Santa Ana Unified School District in which students can earn their Associate of Arts degree at the same time as their high school diploma. In the late 1970s the college purchased the properties on Martha Lane south of the original campus and that land is now part of the parking lot. Recent years have witnessed the further development of and annexation of adjacent property to the original location. For a short time, the college was known as Rancho Santiago College, but the name changed back to Santa Ana College in the late 1990s. In 1985, a satellite campus, what is now called Santiago Canyon College was established in Orange, California. Santiago Canyon has since grown in size to become a separate college from Santa Ana College (although both colleges are part of the Rancho Santiago Community College District). ==Academics== Various programs lead to the awarding of Associate's degrees in Arts and Sciences, as well as vocational certificates. Santa Ana College is also home to the Tessmann Planetarium which was renovated and now has a state-of-the art planetarium system. Tessmann Planetarium is the largest, both in diameter (30 ft) and seating capacity planetarium in the County of Orange CA. It was completed and became operational in 1967. Santa Ana College is also home to Around and About Orange County News (AAOC) and Noticiero Latino del Condado de Orange (NLCO) are student produced weekly news shows that have produced hundreds of professionals that work in the TV Broadcast, Film and Radio Industry. NLCO became the first Spanish language college newscast produced by a community college. The TV Department takes advantage of the Digital Media Center (DMC) which was opened a few years ago. They use the DMC to produce, shoot and edit the College's Newscast. ==Athletics== Santa Ana College sponsors 18 sports programs. The 9 men's sports programs are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming, track and field, water polo and wrestling. The 9 women's programs are basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, track and field, volleyball and water polo. ==Notable alumni== * Duane Allen, NFL player * Barry Asher, Hall of Fame bowler * Heath Bell, MLB All-Star Pitcher for the Miami Marlins * Bob Boyd, Basketball coach * Lem Burnham, NFL player * George Brancato, NFL player and CFL All-star * Al Carmichael, NFL player * Ed Caruthers, high jump olympian * Nancy Fuller, host of Food Network's Farmhouse Rules * Robert David Hall, Actor on the television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
