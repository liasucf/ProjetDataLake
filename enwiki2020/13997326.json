    "text": "Alfonso Beorlegui y Canet (26 January 1888 \u2013 29 September 1936) was a colonel of infantry in the Spanish Army. In the Spanish Civil War, he led the Nationalist forces in the Campaign of Gipuzkoa in August and September 1936. On 18 July 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, in Pamplona, Beorlegui put himself under the orders of General Emilio Mola, who ordered him take control of the Civil Guard and Assault Guards of the city\u2014approximately 2,000 men\u2014and put him in charge of public order in the city. Shortly afterward, Mola ordered Beorlegui to lead an offensive to the Basque province of Gipuzkoa with the regular troops, Civil Guard forces and some newly raised units of requet\u00e9s. After the Battle of Ir\u00fan, they occupied the town on 5 September, closing the French border to the northern provinces of the republic. Beorlegui was wounded in the advance towards the international bridge of Ir\u00fan, refused to receive suitable treatment, and died a month later. Mola's forces soon went on to secure the whole of the province, isolating the remaining Republican provinces in the north, which led to their fall the next year. == Bibliography == * == External links == * \"Beorlegui y Canet, Alfonso\" \u2013 Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia Category:1888 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Military personnel killed in the Spanish Civil War Category:People from Estella Oriental Category:Spanish casualties of the Spanish Civil War Category:Spanish military personnel killed in action Category:Spanish military personnel of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) ",
