    "text": "Hurricane Harbor is the name of a chain of water parks that are part of the Six Flags theme park chain. Although the parks are not identical, common features include a variety of body slides, speed slides, tube slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and shopping areas. ==History== Six Flags began using the Hurricane Harbor brand in 1995 with the opening of Six Flags Hurricane Harbor adjacent to Six Flags Magic Mountain. That same year, Wet 'n Wild in Arlington, Texas, was purchased by Six Flags. It operated as Wet 'n Wild \u2014 A Six Flags Park in 1995-1996 then was rebranded as Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in 1997. The brand has since become a trademark of the Six Flags franchise. In 1999, Six Flags St. Louis was the first Six Flags park to construct its own intra-park water attractions section. As Six Flags acquired and rebranded parks in the 2000s, some existing water parks within these theme parks were later upgraded and rebranded as Hurricane Harbor. Only one Hurricane Harbor has closed. After Six Flags Worlds of Adventure was sold to Cedar Fair in 2004, the water park was renamed Hurricane Hannah's Waterpark. It was abandoned in 2006 and most of the attractions were relocated to a new waterpark on what used to be the marine life side of the park. ==Included with park's admission== ===Six Flags America=== Hurricane Harbor is a water park located within Six Flags America. It was known as Paradise Island until 2005 when it was rebranded Hurricane Harbor. ====Slides and attractions==== {| class= \"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Name !! Description !Opened!!
