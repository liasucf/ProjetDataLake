Todd previously worked at Revolution Health and LivingSocial. Laure worked at Bloomingdales as a Buyer and then at CEB as a Senior Director. Todd and Laure first started working together as website developers and uncovered an untapped need for better analytics about businesses phone calls. 2017: \\- CallTrackingMetrics was named #629 on the Inc 5000 list and in the top 5 fastest growing companies in Maryland. \\- A new integration with Bing Ads allows marketers to capture call attribution data for Bing generated offline conversions.

For example, calls from people who have visited particular pages of a businesses website may be routed to a certain group of agents with expertise in that area.
