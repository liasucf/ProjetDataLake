    "text": "Bachw\u00fcrfel, wrapped individually The Bachw\u00fcrfel (English: Bach-Cube) is an Austrian confectionery created in 1985 on the occasion of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach's tercentenary by Salzburg confectioner Norbert F\u00fcrst. The cube-shaped candy consists of one layer each of marzipan, nut-truffle, and coffee truffle, coated in dark chocolate. Originally produced as a limited- edition confection, it proved popular with consumers and became a staple product of the cafe and sweetmeat shop F\u00fcrst. == History == Prior to Johann Sebastian Bach's anniversary, the Salzburg Bach-Organisation (Salzburger Bachgesellschaft) suggested that Norbert F\u00fcrst, whose great-grandfather Paul F\u00fcrst in 1890 first presented the Mozartkugel, produce a similar confection dedicated to J.S. Bach. According to Norbert F\u00fcrst's son, Martin F\u00fcrst, the jubilee was the sole inducement for his father to come up with the Bachw\u00fcrfel, as Bach himself had had no special connection to Salzburg. == Distribution == While single Bachw\u00fcrfeln can be purchased, the candy is usually sold in small boxes containing four of the truffle cubes. Each of these is wrapped in plastic foil surrounded with a paper cuff imprinted with the composer's portrait. ==References== Category:German desserts Category:Products introduced in 1985 Category:Chocolate-covered foods Category:Sugar confectionery Category:Johann Sebastian Bach ",
