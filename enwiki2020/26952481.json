    "text": "The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was established by NLC Decree 293 of October 10, 1968 amended by NLCD 329 of 1969, and re- established in its present form by CSIR Act 521 on November 26, 1996. The genesis of the Council however, dates back to the erstwhile National Research Council (NRC), which was established by government in August 1958 to organize and coordinate scientific research in Ghana. In 1963, the NRC merged with the former Ghana Academy of Sciences, a statutory learned society. Following a review in 1966, the Academy was reconstituted into, essentially, its original component bodies, namely a national research organization redesignated the CSIR and a learned Society, designated the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. The distinctive features of the 1996 Act are the emphasis accorded private sector concerns, and the introduction of market principles into the Council's operations through the commercialization of research. In this connection, the Council is expected to generate part of its income through the sale of its products and services, and to institute a system of contract research. ==Mandate== The CSIR is mandated to perform the following functions among others: *To pursue the implementation of government policies on scientific research and development; *To advise the sector Minister on scientific and technological advances likely to be of importance to national development; *To encourage coordinated employment of scientific research for the management, utilization and conservation of the natural resources of Ghana in the interest of development; *To encourage in the national interest scientific and industrial research of importance for development of agriculture, health, medicine, environment, technology and other service sectors and to this end to encourage close linkages with the productive sectors of the economy; *To coordinate all aspects of scientific research in the country and to ensure that the Council, the research institutes of the Council and other organizations engaged in research in Ghana, coordinate and cooperate in their research efforts; *To exercise control over the research institutes and projects of the Council and to have power after consultation with the Minister to create, reconstitute, merge or dissolve any institute, centre, unit or project of the Council; *To review, monitor and periodically evaluate the work of the institutes administered by the Council in order to ensure that research being carried out by the institute directly benefits identified sectors of the economy and is within the national priorities; * To institute a system of contract research to ensure that research being carried out in the Council is relevant and cost effective; * To encourage and promote the commercialization of research results; * To undertake or collaborate in the collation, publication and dissemination of the results of research and other useful technical information; * To organize and control services and facilities available to the Council and generally to manage the properties of the Council; *To coordinate human resource development in institutes of the Council and to encourage the training of scientific personnel and research workers through the provision of grants and fellowships; * To cooperate and liaise with international and local bodies and organizations, in particular, the Universities and the private sector on matters of research; and *To perform such other functions as may be determined by the Minister. ==Vision== * Using the transforming power of S&T; for wealth creation. ==Mission== *The CSIR is to become the force for accelerated social and economic development of Ghana through examining, exploring and creating Science and Technology catalysts for public and private wealth creation. ==Structure and organisation== ;The Council The statutory Governing Council is made up of a Chairman and 20 members.
