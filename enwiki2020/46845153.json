    "text": "2008 kranskulla at Vasaloppet, Caroline Westling. Kransmas Erik Smedhs and Vibeke Skofterud, 2012 A kranskulla (\"Wreath Maiden\") (after kulla) is a Swedish woman appointed annually to give the winner of the skiing competition Vasaloppet a laurel victory wreath by hanging it around his neck. A man doing the same task for women winners is called kransmas (\"Wreath Man\"). == History == At the first Vasaloppet, the organizers had ordered a victory wreath from gardener Linqvist. As he walked to the finish line to deliver the wreath, he spotted two women, Therese Eliasson and Svea Romson, dressed in their finest folk costumes and asked if one of them would like to hang the wreath around the neck of the winner. Eliasson accepted even if she was a little worried about how to do this if the winner was tall since she herself was small. However, when the winner Ernst Alm approached the finish line, he stumbled and fell to his knees and thus she had no problem fulfilling her task. The first kransmas was not appointed, but rather a male skier from IFK Mora, Mikael Stenqvist, who in 1985 was asked by the organizers to perform a small \"coup\". He was dressed in folk costume and waited just before the finish line with a wreath for the first female skier to appear. It was Maria Canins-Bonaldi from Italy who got the wreath. In 2006, Martin Johansson was appointed kransmas. He made the race himself, finishing in 44th place and had 15 minutes to change before hanging the victory wreath around the neck of women winner Italian Christina Paluselli. == Function == A kranskulla is a Swedish woman appointed annually to give the winner of the skiing competition Vasaloppet a victory laurel wreath by hanging it around his neck. Mostly the kranskulla stands about from the finish line to give the winner (if it is apparent at that time) his wreath. She is dressed in the traditional folk costume of Dalarna. A man doing the same task for women winners is called kransmas (\"Wreath Man\"). This title became relevant with the event of the women's race, Tjejvasan in 1988. During the year they have been appointed for, the kranskulla and kransmas serve as ambassadors for the race. === Criteria === To be eligible for kranskulla, a women must be unmarried, have distinguished herself in sports, worked at sports events and competitions. Her father's or other family members' sports merits are also taken into consideration. She must also represent one of the sports clubs IFK Mora or S\u00e4lens IF. The criteria for the kransmas is that he must be a member of sports clubs IFK Mora or S\u00e4lens IF, a good representative and example for sports and/or a good sports coach, sports official or active in sports. == In other competitions == Other competitions have adapted the use of kranskulla and kransmas after Vasaloppet. Even though these persons are not from Dalarna, the term and the old dialectal form has remained in the title. Since 1968, a kranskulla has been appointed for cross country running competition Liding\u00f6loppet. Both a kranskulla and kransmas are appointed for open water swimming competition Vansbrosimningen. Cross-country ski race Skinnarloppet has a kranskulla, as do bicycle race Storsj\u00f6n Runt. == Vasaloppet == Women and men appointed kranskulla and kransmas for Vasaloppet. === Kranskulla === *1922 \u2013 Therese Eliasson *1923 \u2013 Hilma Str\u00f6m *1924 \u2013 Maja Lundgren *1925 \u2013 Elsa Cederlund *1926 \u2013 Aina Pers *1927 \u2013 Lea Str\u00f6m *1928 \u2013 Stina Eriksson *1929 \u2013 Elin Henriksson *1930 \u2013 Ethel Eriksson *1931 \u2013 Anna- Britta Mattsson *1932 \u2013 Cancelled *1933 \u2013 Margit Nilsson *1934 \u2013 Cancelled *1935 \u2013 Marianne Edling *1936 \u2013 Inga-Greta Landeck *1937 \u2013 Gerda Berg *1938 \u2013 Majt Sundin *1939 \u2013 Anna-Greta Pettersson *1940 \u2013 Kerstin Cassel *1941 \u2013 Ingrid Asplund *1942 \u2013 Britt Herdin *1943 \u2013 Elsa Karlsson *1944 \u2013 Margareta Julin *1945 \u2013 Kerstin Sars *1946 \u2013 Elsa Sars *1947 \u2013 Nina Lind\u00e9n *1948 \u2013 Ann- Mari Andersson *1949 \u2013 Kerstin Norlin *1950 \u2013 Karin Bergstr\u00f6m *1951 \u2013 Inga Nystr\u00f6m *1952 \u2013 \u00c5sa Mattson-Djos *1953 \u2013 Anna-Greta Beus *1954 \u2013 Birgitta Heimer *1955 \u2013 Kerstin Ingemansson *1956 \u2013 Gun Larsson *1957 \u2013 Barbro Persson *1958 \u2013 Anna-Greta Mattsson *1959 \u2013 Margareta \u00c5hs *1960 \u2013 Maivor Olsson *1961 \u2013 Marianne Eriksson *1962 \u2013 Ann.Mari Hansson *1963 \u2013 Anita H\u00e5kansson *1964 \u2013 Anita Rosendahl *1965 \u2013 Gudrun Nilsson *1966 \u2013 Eva Runesson *1967 \u2013 Christina Fernstr\u00f6m *1968 \u2013 Karin Abrahamsson *1969 \u2013 Christina Spansk *1970 \u2013 Karin Karlsson (now Green) *1971 \u2013 Ingeg\u00e4rd Backlund *1972 \u2013 Marianne Karlsson *1973 \u2013 Gunilla Lannerbro *1974 \u2013 Anna Mattsson *1975 \u2013 Lena Banck *1976 \u2013 \u00c5sa Mattsson *1977 \u2013 Christina Andersson *1978 \u2013 Gunilla Lund *1979 \u2013 Britta Samuelsson *1980 \u2013 Inga-Britt Ax *1981 \u2013 \u00c5sa Norell *1982 \u2013 Anna-Karin Winberg *1983 \u2013 Mait Eriksson *1984 \u2013 Marie Andersson *1985 \u2013 Eva Hermansson *1986 \u2013 Camilla Carlberg *1987 \u2013 Sara Kans *1988 \u2013 Karin V\u00e4rnlund *1989 \u2013 Eva L\u00f6nn *1990 \u2013 Cancelled *1991 \u2013 Christel Asp *1992 \u2013 Maria Gustavsson *1993 \u2013 Helena Gezelius *1994 \u2013 Isabell Andersson *1995 \u2013 Malin Brandt *1996 \u2013 Katrin Svensson *1997 \u2013 Marika Engstr\u00f6m *1998 \u2013 Ida Holmberg *1999 \u2013 Maria Wik *2000 \u2013 Emma Stefansson *2001 \u2013 Catharina Asph *2002 \u2013 Maria Bergqvist *2003 \u2013 \u00c5sa \u00d6stberg *2004 \u2013 Lena Hermansson *2005 \u2013 Eva Lif *2006 \u2013 Julia Limby *2007 \u2013 Eva Svensson *2008 \u2013 Caroline Westling *2009 \u2013 Sandra Brander *2010 \u2013 Helene S\u00f6derlund *2011 \u2013 Frida Dahl *2012 \u2013 Johanna Axelsson *2013 \u2013 Isabelle Jansson *2014 \u2013 Lisa Englund *2015 \u2013 Viktoria St\u00e4rner *2016 \u2013 Hanna Eriksson *2017 \u2013 Lydia Sundin === Kransmas === *1988 \u2013 Axel Jungward *1989 \u2013 Mattias Helgesson *1990 \u2013 Cancelled *1991 \u2013 Erik Frykberg *1992 \u2013 Erik Eriksson *1993 \u2013 Jonas Ors\u00e9n *1994 \u2013 Staffan Larsson *1995 \u2013 Mikael Helgesson *1996 \u2013 Thomas Sparr *1997 \u2013 Jonas Buud *1998 \u2013 Torbj\u00f6rn Schedvin *1999 \u2013 Stefan Hansson *2000 \u2013 Thomas Eriksson *2001 \u2013 Niklas Karlsson *2002 \u2013 Mikael Hedh *2003 \u2013 Andreas Johansson *2004 \u2013 Niclas Jacobsson *2005 \u2013 Markus Leijon *2006 \u2013 Martin Johansson *2007 \u2013 Lars Suther *2008 \u2013 Joakim Engstr\u00f6m *2009 \u2013 Jonas Nilsson *2010 \u2013 Johan \u00d6hagen *2011 \u2013 Anders Solin *2012 \u2013 Erik Smedhs *2013 \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Gatu *2014 \u2013 Daniel Svensson *2015 \u2013 Victor Gustafsson *2016 \u2013 Johan Wellert *2017 \u2013 Linus Rapp == Notes == == References == Category:Sport in Sweden Category:Swedish honorary titles ",
