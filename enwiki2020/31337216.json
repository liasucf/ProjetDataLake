Kingsthorpe is about twenty kilometres from Toowoomba on the Western railway line. The Queensland Parliament approved a branch line north to Goombungee and Haden in December 1908. First used on 21 December 1910, but officially opened in January 1911, the line terminated at Wahoon which was later renamed Haden after the maiden name of the railway minister\u2019s wife.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Press 1990 Between Goombungee and Haden, sidings were established at Weelu and Neuve. A thrice weekly mixed service was replaced in 1930 by a daily rail motor and a twice weekly goods train. The branch closed from 1 May 1964 due no doubt to economic reasons. == References == ==External links== * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1910 Category:Railway lines closed in 1964 Category:Darling Downs Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Australia Category:1910 establishments in Australia Category:1964 disestablishments in Australia ",
