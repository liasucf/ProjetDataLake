    "text": "The Chronicon orientale (or al-Ta\u02ber\u012bkh al-sharq\u012b, both meaning \"eastern chronicle\") is an anonymous universal history written in Arabic by an Egyptian Christian between 1257 and 1260. It was mistakenly attributed to Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir ibn Bu\u1e6drus al-R\u0101hib in the 17th century, an attribution that has been frequently repeated. Maged Mikhail refers to its author as Pseudo-Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir, and Adel Sidarus notes that he has often been referred to as Bu\u1e6drus (Petrus) ibn al-R\u0101hib, erroneously combining Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir's name with that of his father. The work is essentially an abstract or epitome of the chronographical chapters (47\u201350) of Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir's much longer Kit\u0101b al-taw\u0101r\u012bkh, published in 1257. It was written before Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir's ordination as a deacon in or about 1260. The Chronicon has often been dismissed as a pale imitation of the Kit\u0101b, but it does have some independent value. Its chronological ordering is generally trustworthy, but its absolute dates are not. The chronology of the Chronicon is provided by the Old Testament down to the time of Jesus, then by the Roman emperors down to Mu\u1e25ammad and finally by the rulers of Islamic Egypt and Syria down to his own day. It also includes a chronological history of the Caliphate and the Coptic patriarchate from Mark (AD 43\u201368) to Athanasius III (1250\u20131261). The information on the patriarchs is more substantial than that found in Jirj\u012bs al-Mak\u012bn, with an emphasis on martyrdom. Besides Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir's Kit\u0101b, the author of the Chronicon made independent use of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria. The Catholic scholar Abraham Ecchellensis published a Latin translation of the text in 1651, bringing Coptic historiography to western readership for the first time. He did not know the identity of the author of the Chronicon. He added his own Historia orientalis supplementum as an appendix. In the same year, the Protestant theologian Johann Heinrich Hottinger published his own Historia orientalis. In 1729 Giuseppe Simone Assemani reprinted Ecchellensis's with some emendations based on the latter's notes and on a manuscript in the Vatican Library. He attributed it to Ab\u016b Sh\u0101kir and included biographical notes about him. ==Editions== *Chronicon orientale, trans. Abraham Ecchellensis, Paris, 1651 (repr.
