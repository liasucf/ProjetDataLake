His father joined the United States Navy and the family moved around the country, including Florida, Texas, Illinois, California, Virginia, and South Carolina. After high school, Reinhart studied biology in preparation for medical school with the assumption that a career in art was too far-fetched. He attended Clemson University in South Carolina taking the required science classes and various art courses to build up his portfolio. ==Career== After graduating college, Reinhart moved to New York City for a year before starting medical school. There, he met children\u2019s book author Robert Sabuda doing volunteer work together for a local community center. Saduba\u2019s book, Christmas Alphabet had just released to rave reviews, and Sabuda convinced Reinhart to follow his true calling. The following year, Reinhart majored in industrial design (with a concentration in toy design) at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Pratt was fantastic experience for him, but his initial dreams of being a toy designer soon transformed into paper engineer. Reinhart is the co-creator with Sabuda of the New York Times best-selling three-volume pop-up series Encyclopedia Prehistorica. The team\u2019s latest pop-up series is Encyclopedia Mythologica which leads off with Fairies and Magical Creatures (Candlewick, 2008).
