Established in 1916 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education, the school currently caters for approximately 920 students from Year 7 to Year 12. For first year entry, students must sit the Selective High Schools Test and are offered admission into the school based on academic merit. == History == Entrance to the school, in April 2007 In June 1913 it was decided that Kogarah would be a suitable site for a new high school. On 31 October 1914, the land occupied by the cottage \u2018Harrow Villa\u2019 was purchased from its owner. This cottage with portable buildings added became the temporary St George Girls High School. St George Girls High School officially opened in February 1916 with 143 students and nine teachers. == Annual events == Important annual events on the St George calendar include: * Swimming and Athletics Carnivals * The Walkathon * SRC Week * Drama Night, showcasing the talents of Drama students * Senior Drama Night, showcasing talents of Year 12 Drama * 'Inspired' Night, a textiles and design fashion parade * The Summer Music Festival in conjunction with the Multicultural Food Festival * Gala Music Festival * SRC School Dance (with Sydney Technical High School) * The \"Listen\" concerts, which include the Stage Band, Orchestra and Concert Band * The \"Sing\" concerts, which comprise the Vocal Ensemble and the Singing Tutorial girls == Organisations == The School has four school organisations which provide support to the school: * P & C Association - St George Girls High School Parents & Citizen' Association takes an active interest in the welfare and education of students.
