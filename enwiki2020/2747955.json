    "text": "Carlos Tosca (born September 29, 1953 in Pinar del R\u00edo, Cuba) is the current Field coach for the GCL Orioles. He is a former Major League and minor league baseball manager. He was the manager of the Toronto Blue Jays from 2002 to 2004. He succeeded Buck Martinez on June 3, 2002, served the entire season, and was replaced by John Gibbons on August 8, 2004, after compiling a 191-191 win-loss record (.500). Tosca is a graduate of the University of South Florida. He did not play professional baseball, but became a coach at the high school level after his graduation. In 1978, he entered pro baseball as a coach in the Short Season-A New York\u2013Penn League. ==Biography== Tosca managed in the farm systems of the New York Yankees, Kansas City Royals, Florida Marlins and Atlanta Braves for 17 seasons between 1980 and 2001. He was the first manager in the history of the Portland Sea Dogs of the Double-A Eastern League, serving as their pilot from 1994 to 1996. He has managed at the highest level of minor league baseball with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights (1997) and Richmond Braves (2001), and was the bench coach on Buck Showalter's staff during the first three MLB seasons (1998\u20132000) in Arizona Diamondbacks history. Tosca was hired as third base coach of the Blue Jays for the 2002 season by the club's recently appointed general manager, J. P. Ricciardi. When Toronto started poorly (20\u201333, .377) under Martinez\u2014who had been hired by former GM Gord Ash\u2014Ricciardi replaced the incumbent manager with Tosca. Over the final two-thirds of the campaign, Tosca led the Jays to a 58\u201351 (.523) mark and a third-place finish in the American League East Division. Tosca then produced another winning record (86\u201376, .531) and third-place finish in 2003. But in 2004, the Jays won only 47 of their first 111 games (.423) and were in fifth place in their division when Tosca was relieved of command by Ricciardi. The Jays finished the campaign at 67\u201394 (.416). After returning to the D-Backs in 2005\u20132006 to coach third base under manager Bob Melvin, Tosca was the bench coach of the Marlins under Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez from 2007 to June 22, 2010. When Gonz\u00e1lez was hired to replace Bobby Cox as the manager of the Braves following the 2010 season, Tosca was hired to serve as the Braves' new bench coach.http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-braves/being-bilingual-an- advantage-683859.html He managed the Braves on May 10 and 11, 2013 due to Gonz\u00e1lez' daughter's college graduation. On May 17, 2016 both Tosca and Gonz\u00e1lez were dismissed from the Atlanta Braves. In February 2019, Tosca was named as the Field Coach for the GCL Orioles. ==Managerial record== {| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Team ! rowspan=\"2\"| From ! rowspan=\"2\"| To ! colspan=\"3\"| Regular season record ! colspan=\"3\"| Post\u2013season record ! rowspan=\"2\"| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | Toronto Blue Jays | 2002 | 2004 | | colspan=\"3\"| \u2014 | |} ==Personal== Tosca has an identical twin brother named Rick.http://tampasportshistory.blogspot.com/2009/07/catching-up-with-carlos- tosca-part-i.html ==References== ==External links== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Cuban descent Category:Arizona Diamondbacks coaches Category:Atlanta Braves coaches Category:Florida Marlins coaches Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Portland Sea Dogs managers Category:Twin people from the United States Category:Twin sportspeople Category:Toronto Blue Jays coaches Category:Toronto Blue Jays managers Category:University of South Florida alumni Category:Cuban baseball coaches ",
