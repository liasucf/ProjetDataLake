    "text": "The Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 is an Act of the New Zealand Parliament created to replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. It was brought in by the fifth National government and creates a property class for the marine and coastal area, in which it is vested in no one.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 11. This is in contrast to the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 in which the foreshore and seabed was vested in the Crown.Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, section 4. ==Features of the Act== The Marine and Coastal Area Act: * Guarantees free public access. * Makes a common space of the public marine and coastal area, ensuring it can never be sold.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 11. * Protects all existing uses, including recreational fishing and navigation rights.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, Part 2, subpart 2. * Addresses two fundamental rights violated by the Foreshore and Seabed Act \u2013 the right to access justice through the courts, and property rights. The Act provides for primarily two types of rights: protected customary rights, and customary marine title. ** In order to establish protected customary rights, the applicant must show that the right has been exercised since 1840, continues to be exercised in accordance with tikanga Maori, and is not extinguished by law.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 51. This is not an interest in land, but a protection of certain customary interests in that land.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 52. ** In order to establish customary marine title, the applicant must show that the area is held in accordance with tikanga Maori and has been exclusively used and occupied since 1840 without substantial interruption.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 58. This is an interest in land, however it does not include the right of alienation or disposition.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, section 60. * Protects, and in some cases extends, rights of vital infrastructure such as ports and aquaculture.Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, Part 2-3. ==Results of the third reading== M\u0101ori Party Party co-leader Dame Tariana Turia, who left Labour and established the M\u0101ori Party largely as a response to the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, began the third reading of the Bill in the House of Representatives on 24 March 2011. In expressing the support of the M\u0101ori Party, she noted \"[t]his bill is another step in our collective pursuit of Treaty injustice... This bill was never just about the M\u0101ori Party; it started with the leadership of the eight iwi who took an application to the Maori Land Court at the top of the South Island\", referring to the Ngati Apa case. The bill passed by 63\u201356. It was supported by the National, the M\u0101ori Party, and United Future, while the Labour, the Greens, ACT, the Progressive Party and Hone Harawira voted against it. This Act was the key reason for why Harawira left the M\u0101ori Party. In a press statement released on 23 February 2011, in which Harawira announced he was leaving the M\u0101ori Party, he stated \"I did not lead the 2004 Foreshore and Seabed March from Te Rerenga Wairua to Parliament that gave birth to the M\u0101ori Party, to see it destroyed by infighting 5 years later\". ==Controversy== Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei opposed the legislation and argued that it represented just \"how much of a failure the Maori Party - National negotiations have been over trying to resolve the inherent injustices that were put in place by New Zealand First and Labour in 2004. Those injustices remain. The failed principles are still in place in this legislation... just as they were in 2004. It is a great disappointment.\" The Act Party also opposed the legislation, and unsuccessfully attempted to delay the passage of the bill by lodging hundreds of questions with the Speaker. ==Waitangi Tribunal== In 2020 the Waitangi Tribunal found the act breached the Treaty of Waitangi. The tribunal found the Act failed to provide adequate and timely information about the Crown engagement pathway for applicants, and that it had breached its Treaty Duty of active protection by not funding all reasonable costs incurred by the applicant. ==See also== *New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy ==References== == External Links == *Stage One of the WAI 2660 Waitangi Tribunal Inquiry *Text of the Act *The Foreshore and Seabed ministerial review panel (with attached documents summarising the panel's conclusions on the Act).
