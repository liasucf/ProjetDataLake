Bush to make comments that were seen as supportive to the GSEs in order to stem fears that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require a government bailout. Poole was the 2009 keynote speaker at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute. In a major article in April 2009 about Obama Administration Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his role in the national and global financial crisis, William Poole was reported to have said that the Fed, by effectively creating money out of thin air, not only runs the risk of 'massive inflation' but has also done an end-run around Congressional power to control spending. Many of the programs 'ought to be legislated and shouldn't be in the Federal Reserve at all,' he contended.\" The article reported that, \"[a]s the Fed became the biggest vehicle for the bailout, its balance sheet more than doubled, from $900 billion in October 2007 to more than $2 trillion today.\"\"Geithner, as Member and Overseer, Forged Ties to Finance Club\" by Jo Becker and Gretchen Morgenson, The New York Times, 4/26/09, p.
