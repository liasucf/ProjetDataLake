    "text": "Monmouth district () was one of five districts of Gwent in Wales between 1974 and 1996. In 1988 the district was granted a charter conferring borough status, becoming the Borough of Monmouth (although this should not be confused with the historic municipal borough of Monmouth). The district was created by the Local Government Act 1972 from the following parts of the administrative county of Monmouthshire: *The municipal boroughs of Abergavenny and Monmouth, *The urban districts of Chepstow and Usk *The rural districts of Abergavenny, Chepstow, Monmouth and part of Pontypool Rural District. The headquarters of the district council was Mamhilad House, Pontypool. This had previously been the administrative centre of Pontypool Rural District, and was in the neighbouring district of Torfaen. The borough was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, with the area forming nearly all of the new principal area of Monmouthshire (along with Llanelly from Blaenau Gwent). The Parliamentary constituency of Monmouth covers roughly the same area. ==References== Category:Gwent (county) Monmouth Category:1974 establishments in Wales Category:Monmouth, Wales ",
