Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) led the 'Mission Smokeless Village' project with an idea to help women regain their health, and to make cooking easier. This project was started with the understanding that, In India, cooking has been a tough task in many villages. The firewood used as fuel makes women more prone to pneumonia and kitchens get filled with soot, which in turn leads to health problems. The LPG stoves and cylinders were been made available for the villagers. An awareness programme was conducted for the villagers to tell them the importance of going smokeless. As part of this project many guidelines were given and the women were taught how to operate an LPG stove and how to handle the stoves and cylinders carefully. The women were told to switch off the regulator every night. They were further asked to not keep the gas stove switched on with the utensils on top of it.
