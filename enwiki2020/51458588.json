The title is named after Springsteen's iconic 1975 album and song Born to Run. The book is a companion piece to Chapter and Verse, a career-spanning album featuring songs from all stages of Springsteen's career that was released four days before the book. On the date of the book's release, Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour in the United States. The book has received critical acclaim. ==Background== The book's release was officially announced on August 25, 2016. ==Book tour== Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour which started on September 27, 2016, and concluded on October 10, 2016.
