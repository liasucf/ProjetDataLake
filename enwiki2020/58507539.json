    "text": "In probability theory, the Feldman\u2013H\u00e1jek theorem or Feldman\u2013H\u00e1jek dichotomy is a fundamental result in the theory of Gaussian measures. It states that two Gaussian measures \\mu and u on a locally convex space X are either equivalent measures or else mutually singular: (See Theorem 2.7.2) there is no possibility of an intermediate situation in which, for example, \\mu has a density with respect to u but not vice versa. In the special case that X is a Hilbert space, it is possible to give an explicit description of the circumstances under which \\mu and u are equivalent: writing m_{\\mu} and m_{ u} for the means of \\mu and u, and C_\\mu and C_ u for their covariance operators, equivalence of \\mu and u holds if and only if (See Theorem 2.25) * \\mu and u have the same Cameron\u2013Martin space H = C_{\\mu}^{1/2}(X) = C_{ u}^{1/2}(X); * the difference in their means lies in this common Cameron\u2013Martin space, i.e. m_{\\mu} - m_{ u} \\in H; and * the operator (C_{\\mu}^{-1/2} C_{ u}^{1/2}) (C_{\\mu}^{-1/2} C_{ u}^{1/2})^{\\ast} - I is a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator on \\bar{H}. A simple consequence of the Feldman\u2013H\u00e1jek theorem is that dilating a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space X (i.e. taking C_{ u} = s C_{\\mu} for some scale factor s \\geq 0) always yields two mutually singular Gaussian measures, except for the trivial dilation with s = 1, since (s^{2} - 1) I is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt only when s = 1. ==References== Category:Theorems in measure theory Category:Probability theorems ",
