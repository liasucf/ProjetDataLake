(2011 edition). Originally published in 1924. A Magician Among the Spirits. Cambridge University Press. pp. 120-124. Buguet became a \"sensation\" among spiritualists during the early 1870s. He was even loaned money to set up his own studio. In June 1875, a police sting operation in Paris discovered that Buguet's photographic plates had pre-exposed images on them. After the exposure, Buguet admitted in court that his photographs were fraudulent.Martyn Jolly. (2006). Faces of the Living Dead: The Belief in Spirit Photography. Miegunyah Press. p. 22. \"In June 1875, Buguet was tried for fraud. He quickly confessed to surreptitiously double-exposing his plates with images of dummies, or his studio assistants, dressed up in drapery. Police raided his studio and seized two dummies, shrouds, false beards, and almost 300 pictures of various heads glued onto card.\"Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America. Greenwood Press. p. 40. Lynn L. Sharp. (2006). Secular Spirituality: Reincarnation and Spiritism in Nineteenth-century France. Lexington Books. p. 81. He was convicted and served a year jail time.John Hannavy. (2008). Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography. Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. p. 552. According to the magician Harry Houdini, the police discovered figures and doll heads at Buguet's studio. He had used these as his \"spirit\" extras. Houdini noted that although Buguet was exposed as a fraud and he had confessed, some spiritualists still insisted his spirit photographs were genuine. The English medium Stainton Moses had supported Buguet in an article for Human Nature in May 1875.John Mulholland. (1938). Beware Familiar Spirits. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 150. \"Stainton Moses warmly endorsed Buguet in an article printed in May, 1875. In June, 1875, the French government arrested Buguet for fraud. At his trial he made a complete confession, and the police seized and produced his \"spirit\" doll and the collection of heads that fitted on it.\" After Burguet was exposed later in the same year, Moses insisted that Buguet was still a genuine medium and he had been bribed to make a false confession.Frank Podmore. (1902). Modern Spiritualism: A History and Criticism. Volume 2. London: Methuen & Co. pp. 120-123.Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. p. 115. \"Stainton Moses even insisted that the prosecution was instigated by the Church, and that Buguet had been forced or bribed into making a false confession.\" The case has been cited by researchers as an example of spiritualists willing to believe and refusing to accept evidence of fraud.Ronald Pearsall.
