    "text": "The Dubliners is the eponymous debut live album by the Irish folk band The Dubliners. It was produced by Nathan Joseph and released by Transatlantic Records in 1964. The line-up consisted of Ronnie Drew, Barney McKenna, Luke Kelly and Ciar\u00e1n Bourke. When Kelly died, the album title was changed to The Dubliners with Luke Kelly by the record company to spur sales of the reissue and underscore the magnitude of Kelly's contribution to the group. ==Track listing== ===Side One=== # \"The Wild Rover\" - 3:13 # \"The Ragman's Ball\" - 2:08 # \"Preab San \u00d3l\" - 2:14 # \"The High Reel\" - 2:58 # \"The Holy Ground\" - 2:15 # \"Tramps and Hawkers\" - 3:06 # \"Home Boys, Home\" - 3:17 ===Side Two=== # \"Rocky Road to Dublin\" - 2:34 # \"Banks of the Roses\" - 2:12 # \"I'll Tell My Ma\" - 2:06 # \"Swallow's Tail Reel\" - 2:49 # \"Jar of Porter\" - 2:14 # \"Love Is Pleasing\" - 1:47 # \"The Nightingale\" - 3:35 ==Personnel== *Ciar\u00e1n Bourke - vocals, whistle *Ronnie Drew - vocals, guitar *Luke Kelly - vocals, 5-string banjo *Barney McKenna - tenor banjo == Mislabelled Instrumental Tracks == The tune labelled \"Swallow's Tail Reel\" is a medley of \"The Swallow's Tail\" (O'Neill 536) and \"The High Reel\" (O'Neill 721), from O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland. The tune labelled \"The High Reel\" is actually a medley of two different tunes. According to McKenna, the title of the first tune is \"C\u00f3dh\u00e1irdeachais\" (meaning \"Congratulations\" -- this an old, pre-1948, spelling of the Irish word; the current spelling would be \"Comhghairdeas\") and the title of the second is \"The Boyne Hunt\" (O'Neill 514, Willie Clancy 142).Dubliners Discography., retrieved November 4, 2009 Barney McKenna's correction of the title of a tune mislabelled by the record company. == References == Category:The Dubliners live albums Category:1964 debut albums Category:1964 live albums Category:Transatlantic Records live albums ",
