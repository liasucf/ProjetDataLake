He was a delegate to PAIGC's Fifth Congress in December 1991, and in the first multiparty elections, held in 1994, he was elected to the National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau from the 26th Electoral District.

After Vieira's election, Gomes initially refused to recognize the result, but he also moved away from his earlier threat to resign.\"Prime minister says doesn't recognise new president but won't resign\", IRIN, August 23, 2005. Vieira took office on 1 October 2005, and almost two weeks later he and Gomes had a meeting, with Gomes anticipating that the two would be able to work together.\"President, prime minister try to iron out tension, avert crisis\" , IRIN, October 13, 2005. However, on 28 October Vieira announced the dissolution of Gomes's government, and a long-time ally of Vieira, Aristides Gomes, was appointed Prime Minister on 2 November 2005.\"President appoints controversial new prime minister\", IRIN, November 2, 2005. Following the assassination of former navy commander Mohamed Lamine Sanha in early January 2007, Gomes accused Vieira of involvement in the killing in an interview with Lusa on January 8. A warrant was issued for Gomes's arrest on January 10, and when police tried to arrest him later that day he fled and took refuge in the United Nations building in Bissau. A spokesman for Gomes said that it would be unconstitutional to arrest him because he enjoyed immunity as a member of the National People's Assembly.\"Former prime minister of Guinea-Bissau seeks asylum at U.N.\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), January 10, 2007. A presidential spokesman accused Gomes of trying to destabilize the country.\"Indicted former prime minister seeks refuge with UN\", IRIN, January 10, 2007. Gomes left the UN building on January 29, after the arrest warrant was dropped.\"Former Guinea-Bissau prime minister quits U.N. protection after 19 days\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), January 29, 2007.

An investigating judge said that Gomes had not provided any proof for his claim of Vieira's involvement, and on December 20, 2007 it was announced that Gomes had been charged with false testimony and slandering the head of state.\"Bissau accuses former premier of slander\", Reuters (IOL), December 21, 2007.
