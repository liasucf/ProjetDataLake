Its attribution as a youthful work by Parmigianino has not always been unanimous, being supported by Freedberg (1950), Ghidiglia Quintavalle (1963, 1968) and Di Giampaolo (1991) and opposed by Berenson (1907), Venturi (1926), Fr\u00f6hlich-Bum (1921) and Copertini (1932, assigning it instead to Bertoia). Recent scholarship has tended to accept it by comparison with other early works such as Adoration of the Shepherds, with the exception of Rossi (1980), who according to Di Giampaolo argued it was a copy Mario Di Giampaolo ed Elisabetta Fadda, Parmigianino, Keybook, Santarcangelo di Romagna 2002. . It passed through several famous collections such as count Moritz von Fries's collection in Vienna, before being acquired by the English painter Thomas Lawrence in 1830. It was later acquired by the Cook collection in Richmond- upon-Thames, from which it was bought at auction at Christie's on 25 November 1966 by count Antoine Seilern, who bequeathed it to its present owner in 1978. ==References== category:Paintings of Saint Joseph category:Flight into Egypt in art category:Nativity of Jesus in art category:1522 paintings category:Paintings by Parmigianino Category:Paintings of the Courtauld Institute of Art ",
