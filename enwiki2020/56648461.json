    "text": "Portrait of Recio from a photograph taken in Paris Marie Recio, n\u00e9e Marie- Genevi\u00e8ve Martin (10 June 1814 \u2013 13 June 1862) was a French 19th-century opera singer (mezzo-soprano), the second wife of Hector Berlioz. == Biography == Marie Recio was born in Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry to a French military father, Colonel Joseph Martin (1758-1836), battalion commander and a Spanish mother. Peter Bloom believes that it is likely that she took singing lessons from the great Italian singer David Banderali (an academic at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1828 to 1849), being the friend of his daughter, Anne Barthe. In the 1830s, she became a professional singer in Paris. Berlioz and Marie met around 1840. Maybe is it for Marie Recio that Berlioz began Les Nuits d'\u00e9t\u00e9, with Absence (1841, the fourth piece of the final collection), which she often sang and that the musician orchestrated as soon as 1843. Berlioz himself confided: \"She's meowing like a dozen cats.\"Les passions amoureuses on bnf.fr. Thanks to Berlioz's influence, she made her debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 9 October 1841, but it was a fiasco and she only held the position for a few months. Her repertoire was limited: In\u00e8s in Donizetti's La Favorite, Isolier in Rossini's Le Comte Ory and Alice in Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable. It seems that the singer had a stage fright that deprived her of her skills. Marie and Berlioz travelled to Brussels in September 1842 and she accompanied him on his various journeys to Prague in 1846 etc. The couple lived together from 1844 and for almost twenty years. He married her on 19 October 1854, at the Sainte Trinit\u00e9 church in Paris. During all these years, she became collaborator and manager of the musician. She died of a heart disease at a friend's home in Saint- Germain-en-Laye at age 48. Her mother, Marie Sotera Villas Recio, stayed with the composer until his last days. She appeared under the features of actress Ren\u00e9e Saint-Cyr, in La Symphonie fantastique (1942), a feature film by Christian-Jaque. == Bibliography == * * * Pierre-Jean Remy, Dictionnaire amoureux de l'op\u00e9ra, Plon, 2014, 1076 pages , , Read online * Pascal Beyls, Marie Recio, 1814-1862 \u2014 seconde \u00e9pouse de Berlioz. 2015, 209 pages , == References == == External links == * Biography on findagrave.com * Autograph letter from Marie Recio (1843) * Lettre of Berlioz mentioning Marie Recio (1854) * Chronologie: Marie Recio Biographie on Kronobase.org Category:1814 births Category:People from Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry Category:1862 deaths Category:French operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:19th-century French singers Category:Hector Berlioz Category:19th-century women singers ",
