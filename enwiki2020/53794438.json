It is a collection of games, songs, proverbs, stories including those from McKissack's childhood. ==Reception== The School Library Journal, in a star review of Let's Clap, Jump, Sing & Shout, wrote \"Part songbook, part research text, this work is perfect for families to share together or for young scholars who seek to discover an important piece of cultural history. McKissack and Pinkney capture the essence of the songs, stories, and play of an African American childhood.\" The Horn Book Magazine found \"Children\u2019s book royalty and storyteller supreme, Patricia McKissack here compiles an impressive and cohesive treasury of African American children\u2019s culture .. Although sourcing is only variously complete and readers will have to find melody lines for the songs elsewhere, this is a rich compilation to stand beside Rollins\u2019s Christmas Gif\u2019 (rev. 5/94) and Hamilton's The People Could Fly (rev. 3/86).\" Let's Clap, Jump, Sing & Shout also received star reviews by Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly, ==References== Category:2017 non- fiction books Category:American children's books Category:American folklore Category:2017 children's books Category:Books by Patricia McKissack ",
