    "text": "The Ministry of Tourism and Sports () of Argentina is a ministry of the national executive power that oversees and advises on Argentina's national tourism industry and the Argentine state's sports policy. The current minister responsible is Mat\u00edas Lammens, who has served since 10 December 2019 in the cabinet of President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez. ==History== It was created on 29 October 2001 as an extension of the Ministry of Culture, as the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sports, by President Fernando de la R\u00faa. The first minister responsible was Hern\u00e1n Lombardi, but his tenure \u2013 as well as the ministry's existence \u2013 was cut short by the resignation of De la R\u00faa and his entire government less than two months later on 20 December 2001. The tourism and sports portfolios were downgraded to a number of secretariat-level agencies of different ministries (chiefly Culture) by the following presidencies until 2010, when it was reinstated to ministerial level by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who appointed Carlos Enrique Meyer at the helm of the Ministry of Tourism. Gustavo Santos, the minister of tourism appointed by President Mauricio Macri, remained in office as Secretary of Tourism as the ministry was downgraded in a 2018 cabinet reshuffle that saw the number of cabinet ministries reduced from 22 to 11, though this arrangement was short- lived as the portfolio was reinstated as the Ministry of Tourism and Sports on 10 December 2019; Fern\u00e1ndez's appointee to the ministry was Mat\u00edas Lammens, former president of Club Atl\u00e9tico San Lorenzo de Almagro and Buenos Aires mayoral candidate in 2019 for the Frente de Todos. ==Attributions== As established by the ruling Ley de Ministerios (\"Ministries Law\"), adopted in December 2019, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports was reinstated (from having previously been part of the Culture Ministry's portfolio) due to tourism being a \"pivotal activity for the development of the nation,\" and due to the need of \"rationally exploiting it\" making use of tourist attractions and resources\", as well as coordinating the national sports industry. The Ministry's responsibilities and attributions are outlined in Article 23 (nonies) of the current law, which states that, among others, it is within the ministry's competence overseeing the design and execution of plans and programs pertaining to the tourism and high-performance sports in Argentina; promoting tourism and developing Argentina's image on an international scale as well as internally in Argentina itself; coordinating the joint work of the Federal Council of Tourism and the National Council of Sports and Physical Activities; working alongside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent Argentina on a global scale in tourism and sports-related areas, as well as working alongside the Ministry of Transport to elaborate and implement national policy dealing with commercial air travel in tourism-related areas; and promoting the \"Argentina Brand\", among others. ===Structure and dependencies=== As of 2019 the Ministry of Tourism and Sports is organized into the following centralized dependencies: **Undersecretariat of Administrative Management (Secretar\u00eda de Gesti\u00f3n Administrativa) **Undersecretariat of Public Works (Secretar\u00eda de Obras P\u00fablicas) *Secretariat of Tourism Development (Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Tur\u00edstico) **Undersecretariat of National Tourism Quality, Accessibility and Sustainability (Subsecretar\u00eda de Calidad, Accesibilidad y Sustentabilidad del Turismo Nacional) **Undersecretariat of Strategic Development (Subsecretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Estrat\u00e9gico) *Secretariat of Tourism Promotion (Secretar\u00eda de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica) **Undersecretariat of Tourism Promotion and New Products (Subsecretar\u00eda de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica y Nuevos Productos) *Secretariat of Sports (Secretar\u00eda de Deportes) **Undersecretariat of Sports Infrastructure and National Competitions (Subsecretar\u00eda de Infraestructura Deportiva y Competencias Nacionales) **Undersecretariat of Integral Development of Sports Activities (Subsecretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Integral de la Actividad Deportiva) Additionally, a number of decentralized dependencies also report to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, including the National Institute for the Promotion of Tourism (Instituto Nacional de Promoci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica; Inprotur), the National Antidoping Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Antidopaje, CNAD), and the National Agency for High Performance in Sports (Ente Nacional de Alto Rendimiento Deportivo, ENARD). ==Headquarters== The Ministry of Tourism and Sports is headquartered in the Brunetta Tower (Torre Brunetta), a 30 storey- high building located in Suipacha 1111, in the Retiro barrio of Buenos Aires; as of 2018, the ministry owned three floors and rented another four.
