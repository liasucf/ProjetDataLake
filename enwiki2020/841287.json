    "text": "Robert Burns Lindsay (July 4, 1824 in Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, Scotland \u2013 February 13, 1902 in Tuscumbia, Alabama) was a Scots-American politician, elected as the 22nd Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama during Reconstruction, and serving one term from 1870 to 1872. Lindsay studied at the University of St Andrews before emigrating to the United States in 1844. He served in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1853 and the Alabama Senate in 1857, 1865, and 1870. ==1870 political campaign== A Democrat, Lindsay was elected as governor in 1870, following a year of white terrorism against blacks: violence, including murders, and intimidation of black and white Republicans, and freedmen supporters. As examples, five Republicans, four black and one white, were lynched in Calhoun County; three blacks (two who were Republican politicians) were murdered in Greene County, in March and October; the white Republican County Solicitor was murdered there in March; and on October 25, a Republican rally of 2,000 blacks was disrupted by a mob of whites, who killed four blacks and wounded 54 in the Eutaw riot. Blacks were intimidated and stayed home from the polls, with Democratic white voters in Greene County and elsewhere taking the state for Lindsay.Encyclopedia of Alabama ==See also== *List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States ==References== |- Category:1824 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Alabama state senators Category:Members of the Alabama House of Representatives Category:Governors of Alabama Category:People from Tuscumbia, Alabama Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Alabama Democrats Category:Scottish Presbyterians Category:American Presbyterians ",
