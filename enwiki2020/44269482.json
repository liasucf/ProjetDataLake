It is the second attempt of Aeroflot to form a low-cost carrier, after Dobrolet, which ceased operation in August 2014. Pobeda received an air operator's certificate on 11 November 2014, and commerced its maiden flight on 1 December of the same year, from Moscow-Vnukovo to Volgograd. The carrier surpassed 2 million passengers in September 2015, after nine months of operation. The airline had hoped to introduce a Moscow to Bratislava service in October 2015, but the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency turned down an application to operate international flights as the airline has to operate internally for at least two years first. Bratislava Airport and Pobeda, however, announced the launch of first international flight to Bratislava, to be commenced on 19 December 2015.
