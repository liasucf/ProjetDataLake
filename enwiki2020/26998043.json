    "text": "10th Avenue station (also called as Asistio Avenue Station) is a railway station of the Philippine National Railways (PNR) as part of Governor Pascual - FTI Line. Like all PNR stations, the station is at grade. It is located on 10th Avenue in Caloocan, near the original Caloocan railway station. The station was meant to be a part of a revived commuter rail system, built during the term of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. After being constructed, no services to this station were ever provided until August 1, 2018, when it was opened for the Caloocan-Dela Rosa shuttle line. The northbound line is temporarily dismantled to give way for further works in NLEX Segment 10.1, and is currently a temporary single-line track. It was the terminus of said line until the clearing and recondition of the rails in the Caloocan station at Samson Road finished. The line has since been upgraded to terminate at FTI station, with this station no longer the terminus since September 10. Due to nearly a decade of disuse since its construction, the station has been weathered and its gate barriers no longer functioning. It did not have running electricity until very recently, shortly after its reactivation. ==Nearby landmarks== The station is near major landmarks such as the PNR Compound, PNR Caloocan Railway Depot, Poblacion Market, old Caloocan City Hall, Caloocan Central Judiciary Complex, La Consolacion College-Caloocan and Caloocan Cathedral. Further away from the station are the new Caloocan City Hall and schools such as Caloocan Science High School, Caloocan High School, Systems Plus Computer College and University of Caloocan City. Further east and west are motorcycle parts and shop dealers along Mabini and 10th Avenue itself. ==Transportation links== The station is accessible by jeepneys plying routes from A. Mabini Street through 11th Avenue in Caloocan City. Rail skates and rickshaws occasionally run along the line, providing an alternate source of transportation, though before the construction of NLEX Segment 10.1. This was the only line to travel to the Caloocan railway depot. The elevated expressway for NLEX Segment 10.1 is located immediately beside the railway station, with neighboring houses demolished for the construction. ==Station Layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=4 valign=top|L1 Platforms |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the left |- |Platform |PNR Metro Commuter towards FTI and Tutuban (\u2190) |- |Platform |PNR Metro Commuter towards Governor Pascual and Caloocan railway depot (\u2192) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 0px black;border-right:solid 0px black;border- left:solid 0px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|L1 |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Concourse/ Street Level |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=400 valign=top|Ticket Booths, Station Control, Shops, old Caloocan City Hall, Caloocan Judicial Complex, Caloocan Cathedral, Poblacion Market |} ==References== Category:Philippine National Railways stations Category:Railway stations in Metro Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Caloocan ",
