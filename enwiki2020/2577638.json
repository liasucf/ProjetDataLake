    "text": "Alija Sirotanovi\u0107 (14 August 1914 \u2013 16 May 1990) was a Yugoslav miner, Hero of Socialist Labour and perhaps the most famous of all Yugoslav udarniks. He was held up by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to be a model of a hard-worker in the former Yugoslavia. ==Early life and family== Alija Sirotanovi\u0107, a Bosniak, was born in Orahovo, a village in central Bosnia near the town of Breza, and grew up in Trtori\u0107i, another nearby village. He was born in 1914, while Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of Austria-Hungary. He had six brothers and two sisters, all of whom were miners. One of his brothers, Ahmed, died in a mining disaster in 1970. ==Mining record and fame== Sirotanovi\u0107 worked in the coal mine in Breza. In 1947 Sirotanovi\u0107 set a record in coal extracting. On 24 July 1949, Sirotanovi\u0107 participated in an inter-mine competition at the mine at Kreka. He and his eight-man crew mined in an 8-hour shift 128 carloads of brown coal, that is, 152 tons of coal in a single shift, some 40 tonnes more than the first record of Soviet 'hero of labour' Alexey Stakhanov, although this is in dispute. The achievements of the Yugoslav miners were published on news front pages for weeks. In September 1949, the first \"formal meeting of the initiators of the movement for high productivity\" (sve\u010dani sastanak inicijatora pokreta za visoku produktivnost) was held, in which famous productive working record-holders participated, such as Alija Sirotanovi\u0107, Nikola Skobi\u0107, Risto Mijatovi\u0107, Antun Bi\u010di\u0107, Alojz Petek, and others. As there was a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav rift at the time of the contest, his accomplishment was widely praised and publicised by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito is said to have offered to fulfill any wish Sirotanovi\u0107 had, but all Sirotanovi\u0107 is reported to have requested was a bigger shovel. Tito granted his wish, and the larger shovel that was designed for him was later named after him: Sirotanovi\u0107ka. He was offered an appartement in Breza, but he refused and decided to stay in his house in Trtori\u0107i. The meeting between Sirotanovi\u0107 and leading politician Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107 was televised. Sirotanovi\u0107 tried to enter politics, but was unsuccessful. He was a member of the federal parliament for one term. He was retired with pension for merits. He was made an honorable member of the Union of Associations of Engineers and Technicians of Yugoslavia. ==Legacy== He was held up by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to be a model of a hard-worker. In 1987, Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje recorded a song titled \"Srce, ruke i lopata\" (Heart, Hands and Shovel), paying tribute to \"Comrade Avdija\", the model of a hard working, modest man. ===Banknote=== dinar banknote, which does not show Sirotanovi\u0107 He was pictured on the 20,000-Yugoslav dinar banknote, but was often wrongly claimed to be pictured on the 10-dinar banknote. Despite the obvious similarities, the 10-dinar banknote and its 1000-old-dinar predecessor with the same design are older (1955) and showed Arif Herali\u0107, a metal worker working on a blast furnace in Zenica. The newer 20,000-dinar banknote was brought out on May Day in 1987. ==References== ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20051126110554/http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/102/citanka02.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20050902124953/http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/186/t18611.shtml * Alija on Leksikon YU mitologije * Text of song Srce, ruke i lopata Category:1914 births Category:1990 deaths Category:People from Breza, Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims Category:Yugoslav coal miners Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ",
