    "text": "The term Vital Center was first coined by Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in his 1949 book of that title. However, he objects to the domestic use of the phrase: U.S. President Bill Clinton started to use the phrase \"vital center\" in speeches given during his term of office. Schlesinger wrote an article for Slate magazine noting that Clinton hoped to appropriate this term to mean \"middle of the road\" or something that his \"DLC fans\" might prefer its meaning to be, which would locate it \"somewhere closer to Ronald Reagan than to Franklin D. Roosevelt\". In the Slate article, Schlesinger strongly rejected this interpretation of the term, and reiterated his argument from the 1998 introduction: == References == * Schlesinger, Arthur M. The vital center; the politics of freedom. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1949. * Schlesinger, Arthur M. \"It's My 'Vital Center'\". Slate. 10 January 1997. == External links == Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr., THE VITAL CENTER: THE POLITICS OF FREEDOM - a brief excerpt -, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1949) Category:American political catchphrases ",
