    "text": "Arhodomonas aquaeolei is a species of the bacterial genus Arhodomonas noted for its ability to grow in an environment of high salinity. It is an aerobic, oval rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium. It is motile by means a single polar flagellum. A. aquaeolei is among the most halophilic organisms known. The temperature range for the growth of this bacteria is between 20 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C, with optimal growth at 37 \u00b0C and it requires specifically sodium chloride (NaCl) for its growth. (Other salts do not promote growth of A. aquaeolei.) Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations between 6% and 20% in a Campylobacter medium. Although A. aquaeolei is most closely related to purple sulfur bacteria, it does not share those organisms' phototrophic traits. A. aquaeolei has been shown to degrade phenol and phenol based compounds, indicating possible industrial uses. A. aquaeolei causes no known diseases.Arhodomonas aquaeolei gen. nov., sp. nov., an Aerobic, Halophilic Bacterium Isolated from a Subterranean BrineArhodomonas aquaeolei ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== *Type strain of Arhodomonas aquaeolei at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Chromatiales Category:Bacteria described in 1993 ",
