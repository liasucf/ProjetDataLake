    "text": "Diego Luis de San Vitores (November 12, 1627 \u2013 April 2, 1672) was a Spanish Jesuit missionary who founded the first Catholic church on the island of Guam. He is responsible for establishing the Christian presence in the Mariana Islands. He is a controversial figure to some today due to his conflict with the indigenous Chamorro leader Mata'pang. ==Early life== A son of a nobleman, he was baptised Diego Jer\u00f3nimo de San Vitores y Alonso de Maluendo. He was born on November 12, 1627, in the city of Burgos, Spain to Don Jer\u00f3nimo de San Vitores and Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Alonso Maluenda. His parents attempted to persuade him to pursue a military career, but San Vitores instead chose to pursue his religious interests. In 1640, he entered the Jesuit novitiate and was ordained a priest in 1651. San Vitores was granted his request for a mission in the Philippines. In 1662, San Vitores stopped in Guam on the way to the Philippines and vowed to return. Three years later, through his close ties to the royal court, he persuaded King Philip IV of Spain and Queen Maria Ana of Austria to order a mission in Guam be established. ==Mission to Guam== In 1668, San Vitores set sail from Acapulco to Guam. San Vitores called the Chamorro archipelago \"Islas Marianas\" (Mariana Islands) in honour of the Queen Regent of Spain, Maria Ana of Austria, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. The missionary landed on Guam in the village of Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a and was greeted by Chief Kepuha. Kepuha's family donated land to establish the first Catholic mission on Guam. On February 2, 1669, Padre San Vitores established the first Catholic Church in Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a and dedicated it to \"the sweet name of Mary,\" \"Dulce Nombre de Maria.\" According to former journalist and Guampedia editor, Tanya Champaco Mendiola: \"The Chamorros initially welcomed San Vitores and the other Catholic missionaries and hundreds were readily converted. The nobles of the community may have believed this would elevate their social status while others village chiefs desired priests for their own village, probably as symbols of status. Some islanders apparently also received the sacrament of baptism more than once for the gifts of beads and clothing they were given. This enthusiasm for Catholicism did not last long, however, as several factors quickly came into play including the conflicts it created in the hierarchal caste system of the Chamorros. The church preached that once baptized, people were equal in the eyes of God. The missionary\u2019s dogmatic zeal was also not well received as the Jesuits shunned long-standing traditional beliefs and practices in trying to assimilate the Chamorros in Christian doctrine. This included the rejection of the Chamorros long standing veneration of ancestors. As part of the religious practices of Chamorro culture, people had the skulls of deceased family members placed in baskets in places of honor in their homes. The Chamorros believed that this allowed their deceased to have a place to stay and often sought the guidance of their ancestors and favors from them in their daily endeavors. The missionaries told the Chamorros that their ancestors (including parents and grandparents) were burning in hell because they had not been baptized as Christians.\" http://www.guampedia.com/father-diego-luis-de-san- vitores/ The destruction of venerated ancestral skulls is often cited as a grave and insensitive offense by the missionaries against the indigenous Chamorro people. After Chief Kepuha's death in 1669, Spanish missionary and Chamorro relations worsened and the Chamorro - Spanish War began in 1671, led on the Chamorro side by Maga'l\u00e5hi (Chief) Hurao. After several attacks on the Spanish mission, a peace was negotiated. Though San Vitores claimed to want to emulate Francis Xavier, who did not use soldiers in his missionization efforts in India, as his model priest, he also felt that a military presence would be necessary to protect the priests serving Guam. In 1672, San Vitores ordered Churches built in four villages, including Merizo. Later that year, Chamorro resistance increased. == Martyrdom == A Chinese man named Choco, a criminal from Manila who was exiled in Guam, began spreading rumours that the baptismal water used by missionaries was poisonous. As some sickly Chamorro infants who were baptized eventually died, many believed the story and held the missionaries responsible. Choco was readily supported by the macanjas (medicine men) and the urritaos (young males) who despised the missionaries. In their search for a runaway companion named Esteban, San Vitores and his Visayan companion Pedro Calungsod came to the village of Tumon, Guam on 2 April 1672. There they learnt that the wife of the village chief Matapang gave birth to a daughter, and they immediately went to baptise the child. Influenced by the calumnies of Choco, the chief strongly opposed;Interea, illa infans puellula, christiana eius matre consentiente, sacramentali baptismatis lavacro est abluta. Translation: In the mean time, that an infant girl, Christian with the consent of her mother, cleansed by the washing of sacramental baptism. to give Mata'pang some time to calm down, the missionaries gathered the children and some adults of the village at the nearby shore and started chanting with them the tenets of the Catholic religion. They invited Mata'pang to join them, but he shouted back that he was angry with God and was fed up with Christian teachings. Determined to kill the missionaries, Mata'pang went away and tried to enlist another villager, named Hurao, who was not a Christian. Hurao initially refused, mindful of the missionaries' kindness towards the natives, but when Mata'pang branded him a coward, he became piqued and capitulated. Meanwhile, during that brief absence of Mata'pang from his hut, San Vitores and Calungsod baptised the baby girl, with the consent of her Christian mother. When Mata'pang learnt of his daughter's baptism, he became even more furious. He violently hurled spears first at Pedro, who was able to dodge the spears. Witnesses claim that Calungsod could have escaped the attack, but did not want to leave San Vitores alone. Those who knew Calungsod personally meanwhile believed that he could have defeated the aggressors with weapons; San Vitores however banned his companions to carry arms. Calungsod was hit in the chest by a spear and he fell to the ground, then Hurao immediately charged towards him and finished him off with machete blow to the head. San Vitores absolved Calungsod before he too was killed. Mata'pang took San Vitores' crucifix and pounded it with a stone whilst blaspheming God. Both assassins then denuded the corpses of Calungsod and San Vitores, tied large stones to their feet, brought them out to sea on their proas and threw them into the water.http://pedrocalungsod.page.tl/Biography.htm ==Cultural references== While San Vitores remains venerated by many, he is also a figure of criticism in indigenous Chamorro art and literature today. The controversy over his bloody legacy in the Marianas remains strong. The well-known Chamorro poet Craig Santos Perez critically considers San Vitores's negative impact in his poem \"from achiote\" and other works. The spoken-word poet Jay Baza Pascua seeks to rehabilitate Mata'pang's image as a great chief and leader in his poem \"A Descendant of Mata'pang.\" ==Academic critiques== Vince Diaz focuses on San Vitores, the canonization movement, and San Vitores's legacy of \"mass destruction\" among the indigenous peoples of the Marianas in his book Repositioning the Missionary. Cynthia Ross Wiecko describes San Vitores and other Jesuit missionaries as \"agents of empire\": \"Using the lens of ecological change brings Jesuits into a different perspective, one where it is difficult to see them as heroes. Although the socially disruptive effects of militarization and forced catholicization were immediately visible, the two forces also worked hand in hand to destroy ancient Chamorro settlements and profoundly disrupt land use patterns.\" http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/10.3/forum_wiecko.html Wiecko also states: \"Population estimates ranged from 35,000 to 60,000, with an estimated total Chamorro population throughout the Marianas between 40,000 and 100,000. Introduced diseases\u2014especially smallpox, influenza, and tuberculosis\u2014contributed to most of the decline after 1668, but deaths from the Spanish-Chamorro Wars certainly played a role in the indigenous population's decline as well. Reflecting the devastating blows to Guam's native population, the first official Spanish census in 1710 indicated the Chamorro population to be 3,197. At that time, twenty percent of the population lived in and around Aga\u00f1a, with the remaining population spread among the other reducci\u00f3n villages. By 1760, the total population numbered just 1,654 and later fell to only 1,318 in 1786. This was just a shadow of the once-thriving Chamorro society Europeans first encountered. . . . The evidence here indicates that imperial dominance and catholicization shared similar roots of brutality, directly affecting changes in the landscape, settlement patterns, and land use. The combined effects of both fundamentally altered the island's people and environmental history.\" Robert Haddock on A History of Health on Guam: \u201c. . . as the Spanish eventually quelled the Chamorro rebellion, \u201cpeace\u201d was established at the price of the extinction of a race.\u201d Francis X. Hezel, SJ writes: \u201c What began as a religious mission to proclaim the gospel of peace soon degenerated into an out-and out war of military conquest which, as the histories have it, killed off vast numbers of native Chamorros before the missionaries were finally able to make believers out of the few survivors.\u201d (From Conversion to Conquest: the Early Spanish Mission in the Marianas, Journal of Pacific History, pp 115-137, 1982.) Nicholas Goetzfridt states: \"A good non-action example would be the Spanish non- response to massive Chamorro depopulation. The first census of 1710 revealed that\u2014although published interpretative variations eventually find middle ground in the 3,500 range\u20143,539 Chamorros (the most commonly cited number) remained out of early or pre-San Vitores \u2018contact\u2019 estimates ranging from as high as 100,000 to as low as 35,000 Chamorros living in the Mariana Islands. Regardless of the unrecoverable correct number, this figure represents a massive decline in the Chamorro population that went even further after the forced centralization of Chamorros onto Guam (with the exception of a few hundred \u201crefugees\u201d on Rota\u2014Underwood 1973) and into the established, church- centered enclaves of Pago, Inapsan, Inarahan (Inarajan/Inal\u00e5han), Merizo (Malesso\u2019), Umatac (Hum\u00e5tac), and Agat (H\u00e5gat) enforced by Joseph de Quiroga y Losada following his administrative destruction of many Chamorro villages after his 1680 arrival on Guam. By the 1758 full census, only 1,711 \u201cnative Indians\u201d remained, along with 170 soldiers and 830 \u201cSpanish & Filipinos.\u201d This Spanish non-action is evident in the paucity of details concerning any Spanish effort to, if not stem the tide of this decline (often linked to an impending or even realized \u201cextinction\u201d of Chamorros), then render some form of medical response, particularly to the several epidemics and disease outbreaks that pepper the Spanish record. To find any reference to a Spanish effort on this front is to hold a wilting moment of history that cannot be extended into the context of Spain's centuries-long colonization of the Mariana Islands. And yet as scholarship has concerned itself with the chronological and interpretative \u201cfacts\u201d of Guam's history, such a blatant gap in the telling of the Spanish colonial era\u2014extending, of course, to the northern Mariana Islands\u2014has gone unaccounted for and has yet to materialize simply because it is not part of this regurgitated record.\" ==Memorials== The San Vitores Martyrdom Site is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==See also== *Pedro Calungsod *Mata'pang *Villages of Guam *History of Guam *Tumon *Felipe Songsong *Nicolas de Figueroa *Juan de los Reyes == References == ==References and external links== *Rogers, Robert F (1995).
