    "text": "Monaco was represented by French singer Minouche Barelli, with the song '\"Boum-Badaboum\", at the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 8 April in Vienna. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster TMC. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Barelli performed 14th in the running order, following Norway and preceding Yugoslavia. \"Boum-Badaboum\"'s title leads to it frequently being categorised somewhat unjustly in the facile and childish 'ring-ding-bang-boom' school of Eurovision lyrics. However it is pointed out that the song's actual subject matter - Barelli's desire to be able to experience life to the full before the world is destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse - is anything but trivial. At the close of voting \"Boum-Badaboum\" had picked up 10 points (5 from Spain, 2 from Austria and 1 each from France, Sweden and Italy), placing Monaco 5th of the 17 entries.ESC History - Monaco 1967 ==See also== *Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1967 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967 Category:Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1967 in Monaco Category:Monaco stubs ",
