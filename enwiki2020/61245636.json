    "text": "Kalevan Pallo (KalPa) Naiset is a Finnish women's ice hockey team based in Kuopio. They play in the Naisten Liiga, the premier women's hockey league in Finland, where the team has won three Finnish Championship bronze medals. In 2020, the team qualified for the Aurora Borealis Cup final and were set to face off against the reigning champions, Kiekko-Espoo, when the playoffs were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic before the first game of the finals. By making it to the playoff finals, KalPa was guaranteed at least a silver medal, which would have been the team\u2019s highest finish ever, but with the cancellation of the season no Finnish Championship medals were awarded. == Players and personnel == === 2020\u201321 roster === === Current team staff === *Head Coach: Marjo Voutilainen *Assistant Coach: Lauri Saari *Conditioning Coach: Jaakko Uhlb\u00e4ck *Team Managers: Taina Lappi & Sofia Lipponen *Equipment Managers: Lasse Herranen, Jari H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen & Jani Kirstin\u00e4 *Treasurer: Teija Savolainen-Lipponen === Team captains === *Johanna Juutilainen, 2010\u201311 *Isa Rahunen, 2011\u201312 *Marjo Voutilainen, 2012\u201313 *Venla Hovi & Anni Kettunen, 2013\u201314 *Johanna Juutilainen, 2015\u20132018 *Tanja Niskanen, 2018\u201319 *Tiina Ranne & Emma Ritari, 2019\u201320 === Head coaches === * Marjo Voutilainen, 2016\u2013present == Team honours == === Finnish Championship === * Third Place (3): 1995, 1996, 2017 Source: == Notable alumni == Years active with KalPa listed alongside players' names. * Johanna Juutilainen, 2009\u20132018 * Nozomi Kiribuchi, 2015\u201316 * Kati Kovalainen, 1993\u20131996 * Rose Matilainen, 1993\u20131996 * Oona Parviainen, 1993\u20131999 * Tuula Puputti, 1992\u20131995 * Marjo Voutilainen, 1995\u20132001 &2010\u20132014 == References == == External links == * Team information and statistics from Eliteprospects.com and Eurohockey.com and Hockeyarchives.info (in French) * * Category:Women's ice hockey in Finland Category:Ice hockey teams in Finland ",
