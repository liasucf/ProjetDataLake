He died at the young age of 21. ==Life== White was born in Nottingham, the son of a butcher, a trade for which he was himself intended. However, he was greatly attracted to book-learning. By age seven, he was giving reading lessons (unbeknownst to the rest of the family, being offered after the household were abed) to a family servant. After being briefly apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, he was articled to a lawyer, George Coldham. While in this position, he excelled in studying Latin and Greek.Kacirk 1997. When his health deteriorated due to tuberculosis, his employers gave him leave of absence for a month. He chose to live in Wilford at the crossroads, opposite Wilford House between 1804 and 1805. He drew inspiration for much of his poetry from Wilford and the surrounding area.http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/publications/articles/kirkewhite.htmSt Wilfrid's Church and Gazebo, Illustrated London News, 7 July 1888 He wrote many of his poems in the gazebo which stands in the grounds of St Wilfrid's Church, Wilford. Here he wrote:- Seeing the results of White's diligent studies and his deteriorating health, his master offered to release him from his contract if he had sufficient means to go to college. He received encouragement from Capel Lofft, the friend of Robert Bloomfield, and published in 1803, aged 17,Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems, dedicated to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. One of the better known ones was \u2018The Fair Maid of Clifton\u2019 and another was \u2018Clifton Grove\u2019 in which were the controversial lines:- The book was violently attacked in the Monthly Review (February 1804), but White was rewarded with a kind letter from Robert Southey. Through the efforts of his friends, he was able to enter St John's College, Cambridge,His fondest hopes were realized. In October 1805, he went to Cambridge where, by unexampled industry, he speedily attained distinction... (Robert Chambers, Book of Days [1864]) having spent a year beforehand with a private tutor, the Rev. Lorenzo Grainger, at Winteringham, Lincolnshire. Close application to study induced a serious illness, consumption was the disease, according to Sir Harris Nicholas's memoir, to which he ultimately became a victim, and to which White made many allusions in his poems and letters.Memoir by Sir Harris Nicolas in The Poetical Works and Remains of Henry Kirke White, G Routledge, London 1835 Plaque marking Kirke White's BirthplaceFears were also entertained for his sanity, but he went into residence at Cambridge, with a view to taking holy orders, in the autumn of 1805. The strain of continuous study quickly worsened his already deteriorating health resulting in his death.But he had long overtaxed his strength. At the end of one short year ... exhausted nature sank beneath incessant toil and anxiety (Chambers 1864). He was buried in the church of All Saints' Jewry, Cambridge, which stood opposite the gates of St John's College, but has since been demolished. The genuine piety of his religious verses secured a place in popular hymnology for some of his hymns, in particular the still popular O Lord, another day is flown.google.co.uk/books Much of his fame was due to sympathy inspired by his early death; but Lord Byron agreed with Southey about the young man's promise. Robert Southey said of him: \"...he could not rest satisfied till he had formed his principles upon the basis of Christianity.\"Prefatory Note, The Poetical Works and Remains Routledge, London 1835 A metal plaque can be seen in Exchange Arcade, Cheapside in Nottingham, on the site of Kirke White's birthplace.
