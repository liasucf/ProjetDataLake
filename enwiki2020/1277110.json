In 1952, he married Patricia (n\u00e9e Scott). ==Career== Having registered as a conscientious objector, Eddington began his acting career as a teenager with Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) during the Second World War. He worked for a repertory theatre company in Sheffield and made his first TV appearance in 1956 as a regular cast member of The Adventures of Robin Hood.

He had roles in episodes of The Avengers (1963), The Prisoner (1967) and the final episode of The Champions (1969).
