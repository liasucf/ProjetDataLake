Training was provided in trigonometry, geometry, French language and siege warfare. The facilities proved too small and the institution moved to a building in West Street in Farnham in 1813 before being redesignated the Senior Division of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1820 and then becoming the Staff College, Camberley in 1858. ==References== Category:Military academies of the United Kingdom ",
