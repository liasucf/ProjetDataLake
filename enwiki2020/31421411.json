    "text": "Frederick L. \"Rick\" Ahearn (born 1949) is an American political and corporate consultant, currently serving as executive vice president of Potomac Communications Strategies in Alexandria, Virginia. He is best known for his long service as lead advanceman for Ronald Reagan, as a candidate in 1979-80 and for most of his two terms as President; he was standing close to Reagan during his attempted assassination on March 30, 1981. Ahearn was also a senior adviser and planner for the presidential funerals and burials of Reagan (in 2004) and Gerald Ford (in 2006-07), as well as Jack Kemp (in 2009) and First Lady Nancy Reagan (in 2016). In all, he has served five U.S. presidents and six vice presidents, and aided 14 presidential campaigns from 1968 to 2016. ==Early life and political jobs== Ahearn was born and raised in Chestnut Hill, the son of Francis X. Ahearn, one-time president of the Boston City Council and first deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and Doris E. (Johnson) Ahearn. At age 9, he handed out circulars promoting Boston Democrats; as a teenager, he organized crowds for political rallies.Boston Globe', 28 June 1980 He attended Boston Latin School, graduated from Brighton High School, and studied marketing at Boston College. His first political job was for Mayor John Collins. At the age of 19, he worked on the presidential campaign of Democratic Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, advancing the nominee's September 1968 rally in downtown Boston with Senator Kennedy.CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite and NBC Huntley-Brinkley Report, Sept. 19, 1968, accessed through the Vanderbilt Library News Archive. At 21, he worked for Republican Governor Francis Sargent. He again aided Humphrey in his 1972 Democratic primary campaign; however, Ahearn (raised in a devout Catholic home) was revulsed by the liberalism of eventual Democratic nominee George McGovern, and switched his allegiance to Republican Richard M. Nixon. He left college to serve as executive director of Democrats for Nixon in New England (under Collins), and later to organize Democrats for Nixon in California. After the Republican\u2019s landslide victory, he continued his political work for Nixon, working in the White House as a political aide in several special Congressional elections in 1973 and 1974.Boston Globe, 28 June 1980 In 1976, Ahearn served as Northeast regional political director for the President Ford Committee, alongside Haley Barbour (who oversaw the South). In 1979 and 1980, he served as advance man for candidate Ronald Reagan.Boston Globe, 28 June 1980 He first joined the Reagan Presidential Advance Office on January 20, 1981, as a staff assistant to the President. ==Attempted assassination of Reagan, 1981== Ahearn was the lead White House advance man for President Reagan\u2019s speech to the AFL-CIO at the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981. In the now-familiar video footage and photographs, he is seen (in light- grey suit, striped tie and spectacles) preceding the President and then standing beside him while shots are fired by John Hinckley, Jr.http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dreagan%2Bassassination%26ei%3Dutf-8%26fr%3Dyfp-t-701&w;=800&h;=503&imgurl;=photos.upi.com%2Fslideshow%2Flbox%2Fc01311930e142679cc21a7c0178cdd77%2FRonald- Reagan.jpg&rurl;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upi.com%2Fenl- win%2Fc01311930e142679cc21a7c0178cdd77%2F&size;=56KB&name;=Ronald+Reagan+Wa...&p;=reagan+assassination&oid;=f761c61a1b042264d74ae63e346e4a55&fr2;=&no;=3&tt;=3800&sigr;=11svl681g&sigi;=12g4i2sor&sigb;=12pn86pco&.crumb=lpP03K7.iGS#FCar=203e93b5262ac0c7b0636cdeac23b8f4 Ahearn stayed at the scene, cradling the head of wounded Press Secretary James Brady until medics arrived. He then proceeded to George Washington University Hospital, where he ushered the First Lady to the emergency room, then was the first aide to brief reporters (though before network cameras arrived; he can be glimpsed in the background of some later on-camera briefings). In 2001, Ahearn was interviewed on CNN's Larry King Live, and later appeared in a History Channel documentary, concerning the Reagan assassination attempt.CNN, Transcript of Larry King Live, 30 March 2001 In 2015, Ahearn was one of those publicly objecting to the release of assassin John Hinckley from custody. He told NBC, \"I think it's important to remember what this man did. He shot the President of the United States. He condemned Jim Brady to a lifetime sentence in a wheelchair, a life of pain. I feel he's a threat to society if he should be released from treatment without supervision of any kind.\"NBC Today Show, April 23, 2015 (transcript) ==Continued service for Reagan== In November 1981, President Reagan appointed Ahearn as chairman of the Federal Regional Council of New England. He served in this capacity, as well as regional representative of the Secretary of Labor, Raymond Donovan until August 1984. He then left the administration to join President Reagan's re-election campaign staff, picking sites and helping arrange (among other events) the October 1984 whistle-stop tour of Ohio, aboard the same train as used by Harry S Truman in 1948. Following Reagan\u2019s re-election, Ahearn served as a Deputy Director of the 1985 Presidential Inaugural Committee. In February 1985, he resumed his post as Regional Representative of the Secretary of Labor in Region I. Ahearn eventually rejoined the Presidential Advance Office, in February 1986, and was appointed Deputy Director of Presidential Advance in February 1988. In this capacity, he coordinated Reagan\u2019s final campaign trips as President, on behalf of the Bush-Quayle 1988 campaign and the entire Republican ticket, and aided Reagan's communication efforts in general.Los Angeles Times, 2 February 2006, James Gerstenzang Ahearn was often an advocate of spontaneous appearances by Reagan with ordinary people; he personally scouted and arranged for a memorable January 1983 visit to a Dorchester, Mass. workingmen's bar (the Eire Pub) where the President hoisted a mug of beer with patrons.Dorchester Atheneum, June 2, 1983 supplement, accessible thry http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=2851; Ahearn is visible in picture 3 (of 5 on the page) In 1988, Ahearn argued for a Reagan walkthrough at Moscow's crowded Arbat shopping area, during his visit to sign the INF Treaty with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev. This paralleled Gorbachev's unscheduled walk through Washington in 1987; Ahearn's arguments won the Reagans' approval, over Secret Service objections, and the Moscow tour was a success.Kuhn, Jim, Ronald Reagan In Private: A Memoir of My Years in the White House (Sentinel / Penguin, 2004), pp. 240-243 ==HUD and Kemp== After aiding with the Transition of the two Republican Administrations, Ahearn accepted an offer from Jack Kemp, incoming Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary. After President Bush\u2019s defeat in 1992, he continued with Kemp, serving as Senior Advisor to him at Empower America, a public policy organization founded by Kemp, Education Secretary William Bennett and former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. When Kemp was chosen in 1996 as nominee for Vice President by Robert J. Dole, Ahearn went to work for the Dole-Kemp Committee. In 2009, when Kemp died, Ahearn was in charge of arrangements for his memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. ==Professional activities, 1999-present== Ahearn was deputy campaign manager for the Steve Forbes for President Committee in 1999-2000. Forbes was defeated for the GOP nomination by George W. Bush. Following that effort, Ahearn was hired to help manage the campaign of Congressman Rick Lazio for the U.S. Senate, against First Lady Hillary Clinton. Lazio was defeated, in the most expensive Senate campaign in U.S. history. In 2001 and 2002, Ahearn returned to California as campaign manager for Bill Simon in his quest to win the Republican nomination for Governor. Simon was victorious in the March 2002 primary against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. Ahearn then left the campaign and returned to the East Coast; in the fall, Simon was defeated by Democratic incumbent Gray Davis.Los Angeles Times, 24 December 2001, Patt Morrison, Inside Politics column Ahearn served as a campaign manager for the Party of Regions (Ukraine) in 2006 during the National Parliamentary Election in the Party of Regions' successful effort to take control of the Ukrainian Parliament.Times of London, 28 March 2006, Jeremy Page, \"Revolution is reversed with a little spin from the West\"The Ukrainian Weekly, 16 April 2006, Alexander Balaban In 2007 and early 2008, he served as deputy campaign manager for operations of Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s presidential bid.National Journal, 24 January 2008, Matthew Berger http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2008/01/rudys_dep_campa.php His duties included training and supervision of advance staffers, and debate negotiations and execution. Later in 2008, Ahearn returned to California to serve as deputy campaign manager for the Yes on 8 ballot initiative campaign, which scored a surprise triumph in November. \"Rick is absolutely the best in the business. Having Rick on board is a real boon to Yes on 8,\" said Campaign Co-Manager Frank Schubert. \"He's extremely well respected and has the ability to make good things happen.\"Press release, 14 October 2008, protectmarriage.com; accessed through US Newswire At various times during the George W. Bush administration, Ahearn served as volunteer advance man and consultant for the President, Vice President Richard Cheney and others. In the closing months of the 2012 election, Ahearn coordinated advance for the vice presidential campaign of Congressman Paul Ryan. Ahearn was a senior adviser to the Donald Trump presidential campaign, making arrangements for the fall 2016 debates against Hillary Clinton, among other duties, and after the win was a senior consultant to the Trump-Pence Inaugural Committee.Ruane, Michael E., Washington Post, January 19, 2017, \"After 11 inaugurations, the guy who makes it happen has it well mapped out Mike Wagner has gone from tuba player at Nixon's inauguration to lead planner for Trump's\" ==Supervising and Assisting with Presidential Funerals== In 2004, Ahearn (together with James Hooley) was called upon by the Reagan family to oversee the arrangements for the first presidential funeral since Nixon\u2019s in 1994. The Reagan state funeral that June was a massive undertaking with full military honors, memorial services and a procession through Washington D.C. The Californian\u2019s body lay in state at the U.S. Capitol (the first President to do so since 1973), then was flown to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for interment.New York Times, 8 June 2004, Elisabeth Bumiller and Elizabeth Becker, \"Down to the Last Detail, a Reagan-Style Funeral\" Ahearn also served as an advance representative for Vice President Dick Cheney for the Grand Rapids, Michigan portion of Gerald R. Ford\u2019s state funeral. Ford\u2019s state funeral services and ceremonies from December 28, 2006 through January 4, 2007 were, by his choice, more modest, and centered near his desert home in Rancho Mirage, California, a funeral service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. and interment near his presidential museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ahearn\u2019s management of the Reagan funeral in particular drew scorn from some liberal observers. A 2009 book by Will Bunch, Tear Down This Myth, suggested that the ceremonies were choreographed with a political agenda in mind. Bunch wrote in 2011 of pro- Reagan mythmaking that \"No time was that more true than in the days that marked Reagan\u2019s death and funeral in June 2004. In fact, a team of Reagan\u2019s former White House advance team \u2013 the people in charge of spectacular backdrops for the Gipper\u2019s soundbites while he was president \u2013 spent years creating a media-friendly, pre-packaged memorial that would burnish the Reagan myth forever. It was led by former aides Jim Hooley and Rick Ahearn, who even gave their plan a catchy name: Operation Serenade.\"Bunch, Will, 4 Feb 2011, http://tenthltr2u.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/book-excerpt-how-the-media-created- the-legend-of-ronald-reagan-from-tear-down-this-myth-by-will-bunch/ As Matthew Dallek noted in a review of Bunch\u2019s book, \u201cBunch shows a \u2018myth machine\u2019 has diligently worked to polish Reagan's historical reputation and cement his status as one of America's presidential giants. Bunch writes, for instance, that Reagan's defenders viewed his weeklong funeral celebration in June 2004 as, in the words of former White House aide Rick Ahearn, 'a legacy-building event.'\"American Scholar magazine, 22 June 2009, Dallek, Matthew, \u201cNot ready for Mt. Rushmore: reconciling the myth of Ronald Reagan with the reality\u201d Ahearn remained close to Nancy Reagan and her family, and was involved in planning the mostly private funeral before the First Lady's death in March 2016. \"The passing of a first lady is not a state occasion per se,\" said Ahearn. \"She was quite a private person, especially in her later years,\" Ahearn said. Boston Herald, March 8, 2016, \"Global guest list for Reagan funeral\" ==Personal life== Ahearn is a widower, married to the late Pamela Gardner Ahearn (1954\u20132007), a senior protocol officer for Presidents and the U.S. House of Representatives. They had met while working on the gubernatorial campaign of John Dalton of Virginia in 1977.Boston Globe, Obituary, 30 March 2007 Ahearn said he experienced Nancy Reagan's compassion firsthand after Pamela died in 2007. \"We shared a lot of tears,\" Ahearn said. \"She was trying to encourage me, and telling me what it was like for her to lose her husband.\"Encarnacao, Jack, Boston Herald, March 7, 2016, \"A life of dignity, charm, compassion\" Ahearn lives in Alexandria, Virginia and Falmouth, Mass. He has a brother, Kevin P. Ahearn, of Lynn, Mass. == References == Category:1949 births Category:American political consultants Category:Living people ",
