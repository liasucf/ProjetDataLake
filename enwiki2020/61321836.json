    "text": "Phuti Lekoloane (born ), also known as Phuti Minaj, is a South African footballer and LGBTQ activist, from Moletjie,Ga-kolopo, a rural township near Polokwane in the Limpopo province. He played for JDR Stars, a Pretoria-based organization, on their second division team as goalkeeper, and now does so for Tornado F.C., also in the SAFA Second Division. He is Africa\u2019s first openly gay male footballer, having come out publicly in July 2015. His nickname Phuti Minaj came from his mentor John Moshoeu, who caught him twerking while watching a video from Nicki Minaj. == Early life == Phuti Lekoloane was born in Moletjie, Polokwane in the Capricorn District Municipality, the largest Limpopo province in South Africa. He was raised in Tembisa. His family has a farm going back generations; their \u201cextended family owns about 300 hectares in Mooiplaas, Mpumalanga, about 40km from Polokwane.\u201d Lekoloane says he has always known he was gay, being born as such, and that his family was accepting and supportive. However, he was bullied at school for being gay. When he was about 13, he was playing netball and was pulled into being the football goalie when the team was short of players. He\u2019s been playing football since he was fifteen. At seventeen he was playing for Highlands Park F.C. and realized he had a talent for the sport. He also played for Platinum Stars F.C.\u2019s development team before they were moved to Royal Bafokeng Stadium. == Career == === JDR Stars === Lekoloane played for JDR Stars, an ABC Motsepe League team, a Pretoria-based organization, on their SAFA Second Division team as goalkeeper. He wears the 91 shirt in honor of John Moshoeu, a South African Nations Cup champion in 1996, who was his mentor. \"[Moshoeu] is fondly remembered for wearing the number 10 jersey\", Phuti says, \"9 plus 1 equals 10;\" he sought permission from Moshoeu's family, and they gave their blessing. His nickname, Phuti Minaj, was given to him by Moshoeu who caught him twerking while watching a video from Nicki Minaj. He is South Africa\u2019s first openly gay footballer, after coming out publicly in December 2015. His teammates have been mostly supportive, Lekoloane thinks because he has a good attitude and accepts himself. However opposition teams and their fans have taunted and harassed him. Lekoloane has learned to channel that hatred into motivation to make things better for other gay footballers. He left because of homophobia, including a teammate who believed being gay was on par with being a murderer. Being gay remains a crime in many African countries; he has met many closeted gay soccer players. South Africa was the first country on the continent to legalize same-sex marriage. Lekoloane\u2019s goal is to be the first openly gay player in the South African Premier Division of the Premier Soccer League. === Dealing with homophobia === Lekoloane has dealt with homophobia in the sport; at a team\u2019s trial in the mid-2010s, the organization\u2019s representatives said they did not know how to accommodate him, and thought he would be bad for their image. , he has been on trial with five Premier Soccer League teams but they were concerned about his sexuality. Lekoloane noted that while European teams have tried to eradicate homophobia\u2014for instance, the 2016 #RainbowLaces campaign developed by Skins sportswear, to raise awareness about homophobia in sport with Pride in Diversity, \u2014South Africa has not; while they have worked on issues of racism in association football. Homophobia, and toxic masculinity has long existed in football, going back to before Justin Fashanu, the first professional gay footballer, who never came out but his sexuality was an open secret, faced it from his own coach in the 1980s. It continued to Robbie Rogers, and others since. The atmosphere for LGBTQ people in South Africa is still dangerous. The South African Institute of Race Relations (IRR) found that 40% \u201cwho identify as LGBTQIA+, 49% if they are black, know someone who has been murdered because of their sexuality. Those who aren\u2019t murdered are discriminated against.\u201d He feels the homophobia has held him back professionally from playing in the Premier Soccer League. He has vowed to be visible and stand up to the discrimination: === Tornado F.C. === Lekoloane joined Athlete Ally, a sports-focused LGBTQ advocacy organization. He left JDR Stars because of the homophobia, but was later recruited by Tornado F.C., another SAFA Second Division team. Doing so, he had to move from Johannesburg to East London, Eastern Cape, a place known for violence against LGBTQ people. The same IRR study showed LGBTQIA+ identifying people \u201care three times more likely to be attacked in the Eastern Cape than in any other province in the country\u201d. Team manager, Yanga Nyobo, daughter of Tornado\u2019s former chairman, Siphiwo \u201cMawawa\u201d Nyobo, came out to him as gay, and stated the team strives for diversity. He has become the club\u2019s top goalkeeper. In October 2018 he was nominated for the Feather Awards\u2019 Sports Personality of the Year award for \u201ciconic personalities and achievers who inspire\u201d the LGBTQI communities. == See also == * Homosexuality in modern sports * Homosexuality in association football *LGBTQ rights in South Africa *Timeline of LGBTQ history in South Africa *Pride parades in South Africa *LGBTQ tourism in South Africa *LGBTQ pride flag of South Africa == References == Category:South African soccer players Category:LGBT people from South Africa Category:1990s births Category:Living people Category:Gay sportsmen Category:LGBT sportspeople from South Africa Category:LGBT association football players ",
