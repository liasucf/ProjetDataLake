    "text": "encores is a live album by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. The set list includes twenty two songs compiled from Buffett's intimate second encores, with which he ends his concerts. All songs are taken from the 2008/2009 tours. Unlike other live albums by Buffett, encores features few standards and Songs You Know by Heart tunes, making the album less mainstream among fans. The album was recorded during the 2008 \"Year of Still Here Tour,\" with the exception of \"He Went To Paris\" and \"A Pirate Looks at Forty,\" which were recorded in 2009 in Paris and Waikiki, respectively. ==Track listing== ===Disc 1=== 1\\. \"Come Monday\"(Jimmy Buffett) 3:59 :*Jimmy Buffett, Robert Greenidge, Ralph MacDonald, Mac McAnally.
