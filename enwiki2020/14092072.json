    "text": "Ojinaga (Manuel Ojinaga) is a town and seat of the municipality of Ojinaga, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua. As of 2015, the town had a total population of 28,040.http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/chih/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e;=08 It is a rural bordertown on the U.S.-Mexico border, with the city of Presidio, Texas, directly opposite, on the U.S. side of the border. Ojinaga is situated where the R\u00edo Conchos drains into the R\u00edo Grande (known as the Rio Bravo in Mexico), an area called La Junta de los Rios. Presidio and Ojinaga are connected by the Presidio-Ojinaga International Bridge and the Presidio\u2013Ojinaga International Rail Bridge. ==History== Ojinaga was founded around AD 1200 by the Pueblo Native Americans, who were later assimilated by Uto-Aztecan speakers. Ojinaga was first visited by Spanish explorers (led by \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca) in 1535. (See La Junta Indians) Battle in Ojinaga with General Toribio Ortega's troops opening fire on federals.During the Mexican Revolution, Ojinaga was the scene of the Battle of Ojinaga, between Pancho Villa's revolutionaries and government troops. The U.S. writer Ambrose Bierce may have died there, although that is uncertain. ==Culture== Ojinaga still retains its rural culture and environment, with relatively little pollution and few urban problems. Some of the most famous norte\u00f1o-sax artists are from Ojinaga, such as Polo Ur\u00edas, Adolfo Ur\u00edas, Los Diamantes de Ojinaga, Los Rieleros del Norte, Conjunto Primavera, Los Jilgueros del Arroyo, and Los Norte\u00f1os de Ojinaga. ==Location== Because of its location on the R\u00edo Grande border between Chihuahua and the U.S. state of Texas, Ojinaga is often a station for narcotic smuggling and illegal immigration. The creation of the \"La Entrada al Pac\u00edfico\" or \"The Entrance to the Pacific\", has made Ojinaga and Presidio, Texas, into a proposed inland trade corridor between the two countries. The route extends into Odessa-Midland, Texas. Several changes have also had to be made to the port of entry in Presidio, Texas, to accommodate the growing amount of traffic crossing the border. Truck lanes for heavy vehicles have also been added. ==Economy== Ojinaga serves as a support center and market community for the surrounding area. Though it is on the border Ojinaga has drawn little benefit in the form of maquiladoras. Selkirk has a plant which makes chimney, venting and air distribution products. Solitaire Homes has established a factory for producing prefabricated homes.
