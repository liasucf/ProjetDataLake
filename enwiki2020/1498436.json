On 1 September 1939 Polish destroyers met the Royal Navy destroyers and . The British ships led the Polish ships to Leith, and at night the Polish destroyers arrived at Rosyth. In 1940 Burza supported British forces off Norway in April and in the English Channel in May.Rohwer & Hummelchen 1992 pp. 15, 17 On 4 May Burza came alongside the battleship and took aboard Polish survivors who had survived the sinking of ORP Grom earlier that day. On 24 May 1940 Burza was ordered to join the Royal Navy destroyers and and shell German positions that were besieging Calais, providing support for British troops ashore. At 16.20 the Allied vessels opened fire on enemy armoured column at Sangatte Hill west of Calais. 10 minutes later they were attacked by 27 German aircraft which hit and sank Wessex. Vimiera managed to escape. Then the entire enemy air group concentrated on the Polish destroyer. Shrapnel hits jammed her two 40 mm anti- aircraft guns. Three bombs exploded in the water, damaging her boilers and reducing her speed. Then two bombs exploded in the water near or in her bows, forcing Burza to return to Dover stern firstPersonal recollections of Commander Konstanti Okolow-Zubkowski, December 1999 Midshipman Konstanti Okolow-Zubkowski serving on Burza recalled that when back at Dover an admiral came aboard complaining that debris was being thrown over the side of the ship.
