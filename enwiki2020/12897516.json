    "text": "J\u012b (IAST: , ) is a gender-neutral honorific used as a suffix in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, such as Hindi and Punjabi languages and their dialects prevalent in northern India, north-west and central India. 'Ji' is gender-neutral and can be used for as a term of respect for person, relationships or inanimate objects as well. Its usage is similar, but not identical, to another subcontinental honorific, s\u0101hab. It is similar to the gender-neutral Japanese honorific -san. ==Etymology== The origin of the ji honorific is uncertain.Archiv Orient\u00e1ln\u00ed, Volume 75, \u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd orient\u00e1ln\u00ed \u00fastav v Praze, Orient\u00e1ln\u00ed \u00fastav (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 akademie v\u011bd), 2007, ... Artur Karp is concerned with the etymology of the honorific \u2014ji, which belongs to the basic vocabulary of Hindi. Its etymology is unclear and the author points out several possibilities ... One suggestion is that it is a borrowing from an Austroasiatic language such as Sora.Sora-English Dictionary, Gi\u1e0dugu Ve\u1e45ka\u1e6dar\u0101mam\u016brti, Mittal Publications, 1986, ... Is honorific -ji used in the neo-Aryan languages of India borrowed from Sora? ... Another is that the term means 'soul' or 'life' (similar to the j\u0101n suffix) and is derived from Sanskrit.Perfecting Women: Maulana Ashraf \u02bbAl\u012b Thanawi's Bihishti Zewar: a Partial Translation with Commentary, Ashraf \u02bbAl\u012b Th\u0101nv\u012b, Barbara Daly Metcalf, pp. 165, University of California Press, 1992, , ... Seemingly used interchangeably, the terms qalb, dil, and ji are, respectively, Arabic, Persian, and Hindi in origin, the linguistic universalism suggesting the comprehensiveness the term \"heart\" is meant to convey; in all three cases, the meaning spills over to \"self\", \"mind,\" and \"soul\" ... The use of the ji indicates users identity with Hindu culture and Indian language. Dr Harsh K. Luthar gives examples of ji in Master-ji, Guru-ji, and Mata-ji. The use of ji is also used by Urdu speakers who associate with Indian culture and language.https://luthar.com/2014/05/06/the-meaning-of-the-term-ji-in-the- indian-culture-by-dr-harsh-k-luthar/ ==Variant spellings== * jee \u2013 Anglicised spelling, common in old publications. * jii \u2013 example: \u00c1nandam\u00fartijii, founder of \u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga. * jiew \u2013 example: Shankari Mai Jiew in Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi. * joo \u2013 example: Lakshman Joo of Kashmir. * jiu \u2013 example: Radha Raman Jiu temples in Bengal (Radha Raman Ji temples in Uttar Pradesh). * jyu * zi/zee - Eastern Bengali pronunciation ==Usage== Ji can mean respect: * With names, e.g. Gandhiji, Rahulji, Modiji, Nehruji, Sant Ji or Shivji * With inanimate objects of respect, e.g. Gangaji or Kailashji * For groups to whom respect is extended, e.g. Guruji, Panditji, Khalsa Ji * To denote respect in any relation, e.g. Mataji, Baba-ji (respected father), Uncle-ji, Behen-ji (respected sister), Devi-ji (respected madam), Bhabhi-Ji (respected sister-in-law) * In conversation, e.g. \"Ji Nahi\" (No, said with respect) * In polite conversation, e.g. \"Navraj Ji\" (Mr. Navraj, similar to how it would be said in Japanese, Navraj-san) * As a shorthand for yes or to denote respectful attention, \"Ji\" * To reassure that a request has been understood and will be complied with, \"Ji Ji\" * To respectfully ask for clarification, \"Ji?\" (with a questioning tone) * In Parsi (Zoroastrian) names, e.g. in Jamsetji Tata, or Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw ==Contrast with S\u0101hab== S\u0101hab (or s\u0101hib) is always used for an individual, never for an inanimate object or group, though the plural term S\u0101heban exists as well for more than one person. \"S\u0101hab\" is also never used as a shorthand to express agreement, disagreement or ask clarification (whereas \"ji\" is, such as in Ji, Ji nahi or Ji?). Sometimes, the two terms can be combined to S\u0101hab Ji to indicate a high degree of respect, roughly equivalent to Respected Sir. One important exception where s\u0101hab is used for inanimate objects is in connection with Sikh shrines and scripture, e.g. Harmandir Sahib and Guru Granth Sahib. ==Contrast with J\u0101n== J\u0101n is also a commonly used suffix in the subcontinent, but it (and the variant, J\u0101n\u012b) denotes endearment rather than respect and, in some contexts, can denote intimacy or even a romantic relationship. Due to these connotations of intimacy, the subcontinental etiquette surrounding J\u0101n is more complex than the usage of the same term in Persian, where it is used somewhat more liberally (though even there, restrictions apply). As a standalone term, J\u0101n is the rough equivalent of Darling, and is used almost exclusively for close relatives (such as spouses, lovers and children). In this context, sometimes colloquial forms such as J\u0101noo and J\u0101naa, or combination words such as J\u0101neman (my darling) and J\u0101nejaan/J\u0101nejaana (roughly, love of my life), are also used. When used with a name or a relation-term, it means dear. So, bh\u0101i-s\u0101hab and bh\u0101i-ji carry the meaning of respected brother, whereas bh\u0101i-j\u0101n or bhaiyya-j\u0101n\u012b mean dear brother. The term meri j\u0101n, roughly meaning my dear, can be used with friends of the same gender, or in intimate relationships with the opposite gender. In subcontinental etiquette, while bhaijan can be used by males to denote a brotherly relation with any other male of a roughly similar age including total strangers (the female equivalent between women is apajan or didijan), meri j\u0101n is used only with friends with whom informality has been established. Ji, on the other hand, is appropriate in all these situations and across genders because it carries no connotations of intimacy. ==Popular conflation with the letter 'G'== Because English usage is widespread in the Indian subcontinent, the fact that the honorific Ji is pronounced identically to the letter G is used extensively in puns. This is sometimes deliberately exploited in consumer marketing, such as with the popular \"Parle-G Biscuits\" (where the 'G' ostensibly stands for Glucose), which sounds like Parle Ji Biscuits (or, the respected Parle biscuits). A pun popular with children in North India and Pakistan consists entirely of English letters - BBG T PO G, which is pronounced very similarly to Bibi-ji, Tea pi-o ji (meaning, respected ma'am, please have some tea). Some people also add an 'A' or 'O' to this pun as a prefix to give effect as if a person is calling the Bibi-ji, in a typical Indian friendly way used in regional slangs. Thus we may also write it as O BBG T PO G. One may even add the answer of Bibi-ji as PKIG, means I just had the tea. It has been known for a Bengali name ending in -ji to be rendered in Sanskrit as -opadhyay (-a-up\u0101dhy\u0101ya with sandhi, i.e. Mukherjee and Mukhopadhyay). \"Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya\" is Sanskrit for \"teacher\". ==See also== * Sri ==References== Category:Suffixes Category:Hindustani language Category:Hindi Category:Indian culture Category:Honorifics by language ",
