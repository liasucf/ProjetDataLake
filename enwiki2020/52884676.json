The station is to be owned by the Universidad de Guadalajara and operated locally. ==History== XHPBUG received its concession on January 12, 2017 and initially planned to come on air in June, though program testing did not begin until January 2018. The station is the first public station in the country to broadcast almost entirely in an indigenous language, in this case Wix\u00e1rika. XHPBUG operates from the local facilities of the UDG Virtual University System, but most of its programming will be presented locally and the university plans for the station to gain a degree of autonomy over time. The new station will also serve as a complement for a planned bachillerato program in the town. In 2019, XHPBUG was approved to increase its effective radiated power from 130 wattsRPC: #021316 Technical Characteristics of Operation - XHPBUG-FM to 1,000. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Jalisco Category:Indigenous radio stations in Mexico Category:University of Guadalajara ",
