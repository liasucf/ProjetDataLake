Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs had also been forced to flee or were expelled by Bosnian Croat forces, though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers. The UN Security Council Final Report (1994) states while Bosniaks also engaged in \"grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian law\", they did not engage in \"systematic ethnic cleansing\" to the same degree as Bosnian Serb forces. According to the report, \"there is no factual basis for arguing that there is a 'moral equivalence' between the warring factions\".ANNEX IV: Policy of Ethnic Cleansing - Part Two: Ethnic Cleansing in BiH - I: Introduction, 27 May 1994, pp. 36\u201337 Beginning in 1991, political upheavals in Bosnia and Herzegovina displaced about 2.7 million people by mid-1992, of which over 700,000 sought asylum in other European countries, making it the largest exodus in Europe since World War II. It is estimated between 1.0 and 1.3 million people were uprooted in these ethnic cleansing campaigns, and that tens of thousands were killed. The methods used during the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns include \"killing of civilians, rape, torture, destruction of civilian, public, and cultural property, looting and pillaging, and the forcible relocation of civilian populations\".ANNEX IV: Policy of Ethnic Cleansing: Ethnic Cleansing in BiH - I: Introduction, 27 May 1994, p. 33 Most of the perpetrators of these campaigns were Serb forces and most of the victims were Bosniaks. The UN- backed International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later convicted several officials for persecution on political, racial and religious grounds; forced transfer and deportation constituting a crime against humanity. The Srebrenica massacre, which was also included as part of the ethnic cleansing campaign, was found to constitute the crime of genocide. ==Historical background== Bosnia and Herzegovina was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1463 until 1878. During this period, large parts of its population, mostly Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), converted to Islam, giving its society its multiethnic character. Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic groups\u2014the Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats\u2014lived peacefully together from 1878 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, before which intermittent tensions between the three groups were mostly the result of economic issues, though Serbia had had territorial pretensions towards Bosnia and Herzegovina at least since 1878. According to some historians, certain Serb and Croat nationalists, who practiced Orthodox and Catholic Christianity, respectively, never accepted Bosniaks as a nationality and tried to assimilate them into their own cultures. World War II lead to interethnic clashes, though the three groups were evenly split between various factions and did not rally universally along the ethnic lines. After World War II, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Map of Yugoslavia before 1991 After the death of its leader Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia experienced a dysfunctional political system and economic calamity in the 1980s. As communism was losing its potency, new nationalist leaders Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in Serbia and Franjo Tu\u0111man in Croatia came to power.Prosecutor v. Delali\u0107 et al. \u2013 Judgement, 16 November 1998, p. 41 Slovenia and Croatia called for reforms and a looser confederation of the state in Yugoslavia but this call was opposed by the country's government in Belgrade. On 25 June 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. A short armed conflict followed in Slovenia and the Croatian War of Independence escalated. Macedonia also declared independence, which Yugoslavia granted without conflict. The RAM Plan began to be implemented, laying the foundations for new borders of a \"Third Yugoslavia\" in an effort to establish a country where \"all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state\". The Izetbegovi\u0107-Gligorov Plan offered a restructuring of Yugoslavia based on the principle 2+2+2, with Serbia and Montenegro as the core of an asymmetric federation, with Bosnia and Macedonia in a loose federation, and with Croatia and Slovenia in an even looser confederation. The plan was not accepted by either side. In late 1991, the Serbs began establishing autonomous regions in Bosnia. When the Party of Democratic Action's (SDA) representatives in the Parliament of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina announced their plan for a referendum on independence from Yugoslavia on 14 October 1991, leading Bosnian Serb politician Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, made a speech at the parliamentary session and publicly threatened war and the extinction of the Bosniaks as a people. On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly proclaimed the \"Republic of Serbian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", which would include territory with a Serb majority and \"additional territories, not precisely identified but to include areas where the Serbs had been in a majority\" before World War II.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 1114 On 29 February and 1 March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina held an independence referendum, after which it declared independence from Yugoslavia. Most Bosnian Serbs wanted to remain in the same state with Serbia. During the 16th session of the Bosnian Serb Assembly on 12 May 1992, Karad\u017ei\u0107, who was by then the leader of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska proto-state, presented his \"six strategic goals\", which included the \"separation from the other two national communities and the separation of states\", and the \"creation of a corridor in the Drina Valley thus eliminating the Drina [River] as a border between Serbian states\". Republika Srpska General Ratko Mladi\u0107 identified \"Muslims and Croat hordes\" as the enemy and suggested to the Assembly it must decide whether to throw them out by political means or through force.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 1093 The Bosnian War quickly escalated. Serb forces were composed of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Serbian and Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces. Their aim was to form either a rump Yugoslavia or a Greater Serbia. The Serb authorities in Belgrade wanted to annex new territories for Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia that would eventually be added to Serbia and Montenegro.Prosecutor v. Delali\u0107 et al. \u2013 Judgement, 16 November 1998, p. 46 At the start of the war, Bosniak forces that were organized in the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), and Croat forces that were organized in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), initially cooperated against the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Army or VRS). The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) was the official army of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (HR HB), a separate \"political, cultural, economic and territorial entity\" within Bosnia proclaimed by Mate Boban on 18 November 1991. The HVO said it had no secessionary goal and vowed to respect the central government in Sarajevo. The HR HB was financed and armed by Croatia. International officials and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the aim of the establishment of HR HB was to form a Greater Croatia from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina,Prosecutor v. Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez \u2013 Judgement, 26 February 2001, p. 39 in effect partitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina between an expanded Serbia and Croatia. ==Definitions== A destroyed house in the Vi\u0161egrad municipality Ethnic cleansing is a purposeful policy of \"rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area persons from another ethnic group\".ANNEX IV: Policy of Ethnic Cleansing: Summary and Conclusions I. Introduction, 27 May 1994 A report by the UN Commission of Experts dated 27 May 1994 defined ethnic cleansing as an act of \"rendering an area ethnically homogenous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area\", and found that ethnic cleansing has been carried out through \"murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian populations in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian populations, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property\". Such forms of persecution of a group were defined as crimes against humanity and they can also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention. The terms \"ethnic cleansing\" and \"genocide\" are not synonymous but academic discourse considers both to exist within a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to the forced deportation or population transfer of a group to change the ethnic composition of a territory whereas genocide is aimed at the destruction of a group. To draw a distinction between the terms, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered a verdict in the Bosnian Genocide Case: > It [i.e. ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning > of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of > the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither > the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area \"ethnically > homogeneous\", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such > policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes > genocide is \"to destroy, in whole or in part\" a particular group, and > deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by > force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is > such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not > to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute > genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, > 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring > about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, > paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with > the necessary specific intent (dolus specialis), that is to say with a view > to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the > region. \u2014 ICJ. ==International reports== The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations published a staff report on the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia in August 1992. On 17 November the same year, United Nations special rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki issued a report titled \"Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\" to the United Nations (UN). In the report, the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina was singled out and described as a political objective of Serb nationalists who wanted to ensure control of territories with a Serb majority as well as \"adjacent territories assimilated to them\". Paramilitaries played a major role in ethnic cleansing, according to the report.Mazowiecki, 17 November 1992, pp. 6\u20137 On 18 December 1992, the United Nations General Assembly issued resolution 47/147, in which it rejected the \"acquisition of territory by force\" and condemned \"in the strongest possible terms the abhorrent practice of 'ethnic cleansing'\", and recognised \"the Serbian leadership in territories under their control in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Yugoslav Army and the political leadership of the Republic of Serbia bear primary responsibility for this reprehensible practice\". On 1 January 1993, Helsinki Watch released a report on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. It found ethnic cleansing was \"the most egregious violations in both Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina\" because it envisaged \"summary execution, disappearance, arbitrary detention, deportation and forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people on the basis of their religion or nationality\". United Nations Security Council Resolution 780 authorised the establishment of a Commission of Experts to record the crimes in the former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 27 May 1994, these reports, which described the policy of ethnic cleansing, were concluded.ANNEX IV: Policy of Ethnic Cleansing, 27 May 1994 The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on war crimes in the Balkans on 9 August 1995. On 15 November 1999, the UN released its \"Report of the Secretary- General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35: The fall of Srebrenica [A/54/549]\", which details the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995 and found it was part of the larger Serb ethnic cleansing plan to depopulate Bosnian territories they wanted to annex so Serbs could repopulate them.Report A/54/549, 15 November 1999, p. 106 ==Campaigns and methods== The methods used during the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns include \"killing of civilians, rape, torture, destruction of civilian, public, and cultural property, looting and pillaging, and the forcible relocation of civilian populations\". The forcible displacement of civilian populations was a consequence of the conflict and its objective through the ethnic cleansing campaign. The Serb campaign included selective murder of civic, religious and intellectual representatives of Bosniaks and Croats; the sending of adult males into concentration camps and the rape of women. The Serb campaign also included the destruction and burning of Croat and Bosniak historical, religious and cultural sites. ===Serb forces=== Between 700,000 and a 1,000,000 Bosniaks were expelled from their homes from the Bosnian territory held by the Serb forces. Another source estimates that at least 750,000 Bosniaks and a smaller number of Croats were expulsed from these areas. Methods used to achieve this included coercion and terror in order to pressure Bosniaks into leaving Serb- claimed areas. Detainees in the Manja\u010da camp, near Banja Luka, 1992 Numerous discriminatory measures were introduced against Bosniaks on VRS-held territory. In the town of Prijedor, starting from 30 April 1992, non-Serbs were dismissed from their jobs and banned from entering the court building, and were replaced by Serbs. Bosniak intellectuals and others were deported to the Omarska camp.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, pp. 651\u2013652 Bosniak and Croat homes were searched for weapons and were sometimes looted.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 654 Serb forces accompanied non-Serbs wearing white armbands to buses that transported them to camps at Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm camp. Movement was restricted through a curfew and checkpoints. Radio broadcasts appealed to Serbs to \"lynch\" Bosniaks and Croats.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, pp. 656\u2013657 Torture and mistreatment in these detention centres was established to force inmates then to accept the offer of their release under the condition they sign a document that compelled them to leave the area. In Banja Luka, Bosniaks and Croats were evicted from their homes, and incoming displaced Serbs took their accommodation. Forced labour imposed by the authorities hastened the flight of non-Serbs. Those leaving Banja Luka had to sign documents of abandonment of their properties without compensation. Paramiltaries frequently broke into the homes of non-Serbs at night to rob and assault the occupants. In some instances, paramilitaries would shoot at the houses. The local Serb police did not prevent these sustained assaults. In Zvornik, Bosniaks were given official stamps on identity cards for a change of domicile; to leave the area, they were forced to transfer their properties to an agency for the exchange of houses. Starting from May\u2013June 1992, Bosniaks were taken by bus to Tuzla and Subotica in Serbia. Some residents were ordered to leave at gunpoint. Similar forced removals occurred in Fo\u010da, Vlasenica, Br\u010dko, Bosanski \u0160amac, and other Bosnian towns. UNHCR representatives were reluctant to help Bosniaks leave war-affected areas, fearing they would become unwilling accomplices to the ethnic cleansing. Fo\u010da was renamed Srbinje (The Place of the Serbs). One Bosniak woman, who was raped, said her rapist told her his aim was to baptise and convert all of them to Serbs. In Kozluk in June 1992, Bosniaks were rounded up and placed in trucks and trains to remove them from the area. In Bijeljina, non-Serbs were also evicted from their homes and dismissed from their jobs.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 240 Arrested non-Serbs were sent to the Batkovi\u0107 camp, where they performed forced labor on the front lines.Prosecutor v. Karad\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 253 Serb paramilitary singled out Bosniaks and used violence against them. In the Vi\u0161egrad massacres of 1992, hundreds of Bosniaks were rounded up on a bridge, shot and thrown into the river or locked in houses and burnt alive; Bosniak women were raped and a Bosniak man was tied to a car and dragged around the town. The VRS placed Bosniak enclaves under siege. After the VRS takeover of Srebrenica on 11 July 1995, Bosniak men were massacred while 23,000 people were bused out of the area by 13 July. ===Croat forces=== UN Peace keepers collecting bodies from Ahmi\u0107i in April 1993 In early 1992, as VRS forces were advancing towards Od\u017eak and Bosanska Posavina, Croat forces routed Serb civilians living in the area and transported them to Croatia. They also expelled Serbs from Herzegovina and burned their houses in May 1992. In 1993, the Bosnian Croat authorities used ethnic cleansing in conjunction with the attack on Mostar, where Bosniaks were placed in Croat-run detention camps. Croat forces evicted Bosniaks from the western part of Mostar and from other towns and villages, including Stolac and \u010capljina. To assume power in communities in Central Bosnia and Western Herzegovina that were coveted by the HR BH, its president Mate Boban ordered the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) to start persecuting Bosniaks living in these territories. Croat forces used \"artillery, eviction, violence, rape, robbery and extortion\" to expel or kill the Bosniak population, some of whom were detained in the Heliodrom and Dretelj camps. The Ahmi\u0107i and Stupni Do massacres had the aim of removing Bosniaks from these areas. Croat soldiers blew up Bosniak businesses and shops in some towns. They arrested thousands of Bosniak civilians and tried to remove them from Herzegovina by deporting them to third countries. HR HB forces purged Serbs and Bosniaks from government offices and the police. The Bosniaks of HR HB-designated areas were increasingly harassed. In Vitez and Zenica in April 1993, Croat soldiers warned Bosniaks they would be killed in three hours unless they left their homes. Similar events occurred in Prozor, where Bosniaks left after Croat forces took over the city, looting and burning Bosniak shops. ===Bosniak forces=== According to the UN Security Council's \"Final Report (1994)\", Bosniaks engaged in \"grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian law\" but they did not engage in \"systematic ethnic cleansing\". Bosnian prosecutors charged former members of the Bosnian Army with crimes against humanity against Serbs, with the aim of expelling them from Konjic and surrounding villages in May 1992. During the 1993 Siege of Gora\u017ede, Bosniak forces expelled some Serbs from the town and placed others under house arrest. Similar incidents occurred in March 1993 when Bosniak authorities initiated a campaign to expel Croats from Konjic. During the Siege of Sarajevo, Bosniak paramilitary leader Mu\u0161an Topalovi\u0107 and his forces abducted and killed mostly Serbs living in and around the Sarajevo suburb Bistrik before Bosnian police killed Topalovi\u0107 in October 1993. After the war, Croats left Vare\u0161 voluntarily, fearing Bosniak revenge. The departure of Croats from Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica had different motives, which were not always the direct consequence of pressure by Bosniaks. ==Demographic changes== Displaced Bosnians in 1993 Percentual change of the number of ethnic Bosniaks by Municipality from 1991 to 2013 According to the 1991 census, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,364,574, of whom 43.7% were Bosniaks, 31.4% were Serbs, 17.3% were Croats and 5.5% were Yugoslavs. In 1981, around 16% of the population were of mixed ancestry. Serbs comprised 31% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's populace but Karad\u017ei\u0107 claimed 70% of the country's territory. The organizers of the ethnic cleansing campaign wanted to replace Bosnia's multiethnic society with a society based on Serb nationalist supremacy, which was seen as a form of Serbianisation of these areas. Indian academic Radha Kumar described such territorial separation of groups based on their nationality as \"ethnic apartheid\". It is estimated between 1.0 and 1.3 million people were uprooted and that tens of thousands were killed during the ethnic cleansing. Serb forces perpetrated most of the ethnic cleansing campaigns and the majority of the victims were Bosniaks. In September 1994, UNHCR representatives estimated around 80,000 non-Serbs out of 837,000 who initially lived on the Serb-controlled territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina before the war remained there; an estimated removal of 90% of the Bosniak and Croat inhabitants of Serb-coveted territory, almost all of whom were deliberately forced out of their homes. By the end of the war in late 1995, the Bosnian Serb forces had expelled or killed 95% of all non-Serbs living in the territory they annexed. Before the war, the Bosnian territory held by the Army of the Republika Srpska was comprised out of 47% Serbs, 33% Bosniaks and 13% Croats. After the war, according to a research by Bosnian demographer Murat Pra\u0161o, in 1995 Serbs comprised 89%, while Bosniaks made 3% and Croats 1% of the remaining population. In the Bosnian territory held by the HVO and the Croatian Army, before the war, Croats comprised 49% of the population; this percentage rose to 96% in 1996. By the same year, the percentage of Bosniaks fell from 22% to 2.5% and the percentage of Serbs fell from 25% to 0.3%. Before the war, Bosniaks comprised 57% of the populace of territory controlled by the Bosnian government; at the end of the war, they comprised 74%. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ 1991\u20131995 demographic changes, based on the pre-Dayton Agreement territorial control, according to Murat Pra\u0161o |- | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Territory held by the Army of Republika Srpska !

According to his research, in Republika Srpska, the number of Bosniaks changed from 473,000 in 1991 to 100,000 in 2011, the number of Croats from 151,000 to 15,000, and the number of Serbs changed from 886,000 to 1,220,000. In the territory controlled by the ARBiH, the number of Serbs changed from 400,000 to 50,000, the number of Croats changed from 243,000 to 110,000, and the number of Bosniaks changed from 1,323,000 to 1,550,000. In the HVO-held area, the number of Serbs changed from 80,000 to 20,000, the number of Bosniaks changed from 107,000 to 70,000, and the number of Croats changed 367,000 in 1991 to 370,000 in 2011. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ 1991\u20132011 demographic changes, based on the 1995/1996 territorial control, according to Sa\u0161a Mrdulja\u0161 |- | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Territory held by the Army of Republika Srpska |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Ethnic group |- align=\"center\" ! data-sort-type=number | 1991 ! 2011 !

The Bosnian War ended when the Dayton Agreement was signed on 14 December 1995; it stipulated Bosnia and Herzegovina was to stay a united country shared by Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska, and granted the right of return for victims of ethnic cleansing. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; width: 500px\" |+ Number of refugees or internally displaced in 1992\u20131995 ! scope=\"col\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" | Bosniaks ! scope=\"col\" | Croats ! scope=\"col\" | Serbs |- | Bosnia and Herzegovina || 1,270,000 (63% of the group) || 490,000 (67% of the group) || 540,000 (39% of the group) |} The homogenization of the population continued after the war finished. When the Serb-held areas of Sarajevo were transferred to the FBiH in March 1996, many Serbs left Sarajevo in the ensuing months. Between 60,000 and 90,000 Serbs left Sarajevo's suburbs. This was interpreted as a result of Dayton's division of Bosnia along ethnic lines. The Bosnian Serbs' politicians pressured Serbs into leaving Sarajevo while the mixed statements of the Bosnian government caused a lack of confidence among Serb inhabitants. Bosnian Serb extremists burned apartments and expelled Serbs who wanted to stay in these suburbs before the handover to the Bosnian government. In Ilid\u017ea, medicine, machines and utility equipment disappeared. Serb politician Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik publicly called for Serbs to leave Sarajevo, which prompted a UN press officer to call the Serb authorities \"the masters of manipulation\". This episode is often cited as \"difficult to distinguish between coercion and voluntarism\". The demographic changes caused by the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina were the most dramatic that country had experienced in a century; the 2013 population census registered 3,531,159 inhabitants\u2014a more-than-19% decline within a single generation. ==Destruction of religious buildings== ===Islamic=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Destruction of Islamic religious buildings in Bosnia (1992\u20131995) ! !

Some of the destruction was incidental damage from combat but most of the extensive destruction and plunder was part of a deliberate plan of ethnic cleansing that was aimed at preventing expelled people from returning to their homes. Half of the schools and a third of the hospitals in the country were also damaged or destroyed. ==Legal prosecution and war crimes trials== Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, the president of Republika Srpska, was sentenced for genocide in Bosnia by the ICTY in 2016 Several people were tried and convicted by the UN-backed International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in connection with persecution on racial, religious or ethnic grounds, forced displacement and deportation as a crime against humanity during the Bosnian War. The Srebrenica massacre, which was also included as part of the ethnic cleansing campaign, was found to constitute a crime of genocide. Those convicted for taking part in the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina include Bosnian Serb politicians, soldiers and officials Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik, Radoslav Br\u0111anin, Stojan \u017dupljanin, Mi\u0107o Stani\u0161i\u0107, Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107, Goran Jelisi\u0107, Miroslav Deronji\u0107, Zoran \u017digi\u0107, Blagoje Simi\u0107, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Ratko Mladi\u0107. They also include Bosnian Croat officials Mladen Naletili\u0107, Dario Kordi\u0107, Slobodan Praljak, Bruno Stoji\u0107 and Jadranko Prli\u0107. In its verdict against Karad\u017ei\u0107, the ICTY found there was a joint criminal enterprise that aimed to forcibly resettle non-Serbs from large parts of Bosnia, and that it existed from October 1991: In the judgement against Bosnian Croat leader Dario Kordi\u0107, the ICTY found there was a plan to remove Bosniaks from Croat-claimed territory: ==See also== * Bosnian genocide * Bosnian genocide case * Territorial nationalism ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1992 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:1993 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:1994 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Croatian nationalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbian nationalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
