    "text": "Jacob Cramer (born August 7, 2000 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American social entrepreneur and activist, known as the founder and executive director of Love For Our Elders. == Founding Love For Our Elders == In eighth grade, Cramer became inspired by his grandfather's death to make a difference in the lives of older adults. He wrote kind notes to nursing homes, and upon receiving overwhelmingly positive responses, he began recruiting others and teaching himself about building a sustainable nonprofit: sophisticated search engine optimization techniques, website design, and 501(c)(3) legal requirements. Today, his nonprofit operates on a global scale. == Accomplishments == In 2015, Cramer became the youngest representing member of the World Kindness Movement. In December 2016, he was featured on the front cover of American Profile magazine for his nonprofit work. Following this, in January 2017, he was featured alongside Lady Gaga and Daniel Lubetzky in sister publication Parade. In January 2018, Cramer was announced as one of Lady Gaga's Channel Kindness reporters for her Born this Way Foundation. He has given 2 TEDx talks. == Personal life == Jacob Eli Cramer was raised in Cleveland, Ohio by parents Barry and Kathy Cramer. He graduated from Orange High School in May 2018 and is a student at Yale University. == References == Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:American founders Category:People from Pepper Pike, Ohio Category:Activists from Ohio Category:Social entrepreneurs Category:Writers from Ohio ",
