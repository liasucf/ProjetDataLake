The team transformed a DS3 WRC into a laboratory vehicle to help with early development, while the engine was an evolution of their WRC engine which had been used in the WRC since 2011. Citro\u00ebn started developing the car for the new TC1 regulations, which were brought forward a year early in 2014 to expedite the entry of Citro\u00ebn into the championship. The introduction of the new regulations a year earlier than planned gave a seven month development headstart to Citro\u00ebn over the other manufacturers. This large development advantage combined with a big budget and a strong driver line-up made Citro\u00ebn the clear favourite going into the first season of the new regulations in 2014. Citro\u00ebn would go on to win most of the races that season as well as the manufacturers' title, while Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez won the drivers' title. The team would repeat this feat in 2015 and 2016, before the factory team left the series at the end of 2016. A number of Citro\u00ebns were still raced by other teams in 2017, but were outpaced by the Hondas and the Volvos. ==Sales== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\";\" |- align=\"center\" | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Year | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide Production | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide sales | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Notes |- |2009 | align=\"center\" |76,000 | align=\"center\" |75,500 | |- |2010 | align=\"center\" |72,000 | align=\"center\" |71,800 | |- |2011 | align=\"center\" |66,327 | align=\"center\" |65,545 | |- |2012 | align=\"center\" |55,600 | align=\"center\" |55,600 | |- |2013 | align=\"center\" |55,100 | align=\"center\" |55,900 | |} ==References== ==External links== *CITRO\u00cbNS: Donfeng *Citro\u00ebn Elys\u00e9e at Citro\u00ebn\u00ebt Elysee Category:Dongfeng vehicles Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars of China Category:2010s cars Category:Compact cars Category:Sedans Category:Touring cars Category:Cars introduced in 2002 ",
