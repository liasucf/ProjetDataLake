The house is on the National Register of Historic Places.State Historic Preservation Office: Oklahoma Historical Society.Oklahoma's National Register Handbook. April 1, 2015. Accessed July 2, 2015. ==History== Benjamin Franklin Smallwood was an important leader of the Choctaw. He was representative to the Choctaw nation from 1847 to 1887. As a representative, he held the office of speaker for many years and was the leader of the National Party. He was elected Principal Chief of Choctaw Nation in 1888 and served for two years as chief. Because he refused to meet with United States government officials unless they came to his home, his home was where important meetings of Choctaw legislators, religious leaders, and members of the United States Congress were held. The house was originally part of a 500-acre farm that included four mineral springs. In 1982, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is the last surviving structure associated with Smallwood. At the time it was built, the Smallwood House was located in Atoka County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. ==Architecture== The house is a two-story sandstone building measuring . The roof is gone; it was originally a gabled roof. The building has sixteen windows; those on the second floor measure 5 by 3 feet, and those on the first floor are 3 feet square.
