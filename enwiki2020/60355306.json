He received the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle 2017 Craig Noel Award for Outstanding Male Performance for his role in Hand to God. == Biography == Foote acted at a young age in various theatre productions. From age 7 to 14, he was raised on Montserrat, a volcanic island in the Caribbean. He attended University of Michigan, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting in 2016. Following graduation, Foote appeared in several stage productions, including Luis Valdez' 2017 production of Zoot Suit and the San Diego Repertory Theatre's 2017 production of Hand to God. Critics wrote of Hand to God, \"Caleb Foote gives a virtuosic performance, changing his voice and manner (he\u2019s so withdrawn and tic-riddled as Jason, so harsh and antagonistic as Tyrone), while deftly manipulating a puppet with both hands, and discoursing with himself in rapid-fire, angry, funny ways. ... It\u2019s a neck-snapping, challenge, [sic] and it\u2019s thrilling to watch.\" \"Caleb Foote as Jason and Tyrone is remarkable in balancing performances as both the cowering Jason and the aggressive Tyrone. ... there is a marked difference between the two performances. When Jason speaks it is a plea, when Tyrone speaks it is a bark with teeth\"; \"this is hand puppet Tyrone\u2019s show all the way, which makes this young Foote\u2019s show\"; \"Foote plays Tyrone, too, with an unearthly way of voicing him that swoops from the guttural to the sing-song. All the while, the actor is also managing Tyrone\u2019s very expressive physical antics while maintaining both sides of conversations between puppet and master. ... It\u2019s an extraordinary performance\". For this performance, Foote the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle 2017 Craig Noel Award for Outstanding Male Performance. == Filmography == === Film and video === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
