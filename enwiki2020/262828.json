He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Wexford from 1918 to 1922 and 1923 to 1965, and as senator from 1965 to 1969. He was in Sinn F\u00e9in until Fianna F\u00e1il's 1926 foundation. ==Early and private life== Ryan was born on the family farm at Tomcoole, near Taghmon, County Wexford in 1891. The second youngest of twelve children he was educated at St Peter's College, Wexford and Ring College, Waterford. In 1911, Ryan won a county council scholarship to University College Dublin where he studied medicine.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 He passed his final medical exam in March 1917 and subsequently opened a medical practice in Wexford. Four years later in 1921, Ryan moved to Dublin where he opened a practice at Harcourt Street, specialising in skin diseases at the Skin and Cancer Hospital on Holles Street. He left medicine in 1925, after he bought Kindlestown, a large farm near Delgany, County Wicklow. Ryan lived there and it remained a working farm until his death. In July 1919, Ryan married M\u00e1ir\u00edn Cregan, originally from County Kerry and a close friend of Sin\u00e9ad de Valera throughout her life. Cregan, like her husband, had also fought in the Easter Rising and was subsequently an author of children's stories in Irish. They had three children together. One of Ryan's sisters, Mary Kate, married Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly, one of Ryan's future cabinet colleagues and a future President of Ireland. Following her death O'Kelly married her sister, Phyllis Ryan. Another of Ryan's sisters, Josephine ('Min') Ryan, married Richard Mulcahy, a future leader of Fine Gael. Another sister, Agnes, married Denis McCullough, a Cumann na nGaedheal TD from 1924 to 1927. ==Revolutionary career== While studying at university in 1913 Ryan joined the Gaelic League at Clonmel. The company commander recruited the young catholic nationalist, who became a founder-member of the Irish Volunteers and was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year. During the Easter Rising in 1916, Ryan was the medical officer in the General Post Office (GPO). He was, along with James Connolly, one of the last people to leave the GPO when the evacuation took place. Following the surrender of the patriots Ryan was deported to HM Prison Stafford in England and subsequently at Frongoch. He was released in August 1916.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 Ryan rejoined the Volunteers immediately after his release from prison, and in June 1917, he was elected Commandant of the Wexford Battalion. His political career began the following year when he was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for the constituency of Wexford South in the 1918 general election. Like his fellow Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, Ryan refused to attend the Westminster Parliament. Instead he attended the proceedings of the First D\u00e1il on 21 January 1919. As the War of Independence went on, Ryan became Brigade Commandant of South Wexford and was also elected to Wexford County Council, serving as chairman on one occasion. In September 1919, he was arrested by the British and interned on Spike Island and later Bere Island until he was released after the June 1921 truce. Anglo-Irish Treaty which he voted against. In the 1922 \"pact election\" Ryan and one of the other two anti-Treaty Wexford TDs lost their seats to pro-Treaty candidates, and Ryan was imprisoned during the subsequent Civil War. While interned he won back his D\u00e1il seat as an abstentionist at the 1923 general election. ==Political career== In 1926, Ryan was among the Sinn F\u00e9in TDs who followed leader \u00c9amon de Valera out of the party to found Fianna F\u00e1il. They entered the D\u00e1il in 1927 and spent five years on the opposition benches.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 ===Minister for Agriculture=== Following the 1932 general election, Fianna F\u00e1il came to power appointing Ryan Minister for Agriculture, a position he would continuously hold for fifteen years. In agriculture the government's policy was based on the idea of self-sufficiency or autarky. \"Irish farmers should have always been looking for prosperity from the towns of Britain. If they got people working in our own towns they would consume Irish produce,\" he declared at Blackwater, County Wexford calling it the idea of a cyclical arrangement.19 January 1933, The Irish Press, 2. Ryan was given the task of implementing the following policies: imports of wheat, sugar and other agricultural produce were restricted; farmers were given a guaranteed price for wheat; farmers were forced to use home-produced grain in animal feed and bakers had to use a certain percentage of Irish flour in their bread; and the sugar beet industry was expanded with the opening of new factories. While these policies saw increases in sugar-beet production and in the growing of wheat the small farmers of Munster and Connacht gained little while the large farmers were the real beneficiaries. Ryan faced severe criticism over the Economic War with Britain: serious harm was done to the cattle trade, Ireland's main export earner. The government tried to compensate by giving bounties equal to the British duties, however, these had to be paid for by the taxpayer. The economic war ended in 1938 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement between both governments, after a series of talks in London between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, de Valera, Ryan and Se\u00e1n Lemass. During World War II self-sufficiency in food became essential. The Department of Agriculture ordered every farmer to till one-eighth of his land. This was raised to three-eighths in 1944.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/emergency-economics-ireland- during-the-second-world-war-1.1861902 In spite of strict rationing and severe shortages, basic foodstuffs remained available. At war's end farmers discontent emerged once again. A new political party, Clann na Talmhan, was established in the late 1930s to represent the interests of smaller farmers in the west of Ireland. Similarly, much of the country's land had become exhausted due to increased wartime productivity and a shortage of fertilisers. ===Minister for Health and Social Welfare=== In 1947, after spending fifteen years as Minister for Agriculture, Ryan was appointed to the newly created position of Minister for Health and Social Welfare. The minister brought the draft Health Bill to the cabinet's attention later that year. This was a radical and innovative piece of legislation which proposed to modernise the health service into two aspects \u2013 mother and child welfare and infectious diseases. De Valera was anxious about accepting these measures as government policy due to opposition from the Catholic Church. In fact, much of the legislation was controversially enacted by Noel Browne, Ryan's successor as Minister from 1948 to 1951. Following Fianna F\u00e1il's return to power at the 1951 general election, Ryan returned as Minister for Health and Social Welfare. During his second period in office he clashed with the Church once again over the implementation of the remaining aspects of the 'Mother and Child Scheme'. Following negotiations with the hierarchy, adjustments on such issues as means testing and medical inspections were made and the legislation was passed in the D\u00e1il. Following the 1954 general election, Fianna F\u00e1il lost power and Ryan moved to the backbenches once again. ===Minister for Finance=== Following the 1957 general election, Fianna F\u00e1il were back in power and de Valera's cabinet had a new look to it. In a clear message that there would be a change to economic policy Ryan, a close ally of Se\u00e1n Lemass, was appointed Minister for Finance, replacing the conservative Se\u00e1n MacEntee. The first sign of a new economic approach came in 1958, when Ryan brought the First Programme for Economic Development to the cabinet table. This plan, the brainchild of T. K. Whitaker, recognised that Ireland would have to move away from self- sufficiency towards free trade. It also proposed that foreign firms should be given grants and tax breaks to set up in Ireland.https://www.ucd.ie/archives/collections/depositedcollections/items/collectionname,235343,en.html#accordion1 When Se\u00e1n Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959, Ryan was retained in the Finance portfolio. Lemass also wanted to reward him for his loyalty by naming him T\u00e1naiste, however, the new leader felt obliged to appoint Se\u00e1n MacEntee, one of the party elders to the position. Ryan continued to implement the First Programme throughout the early 1960s, achieving a record growth rate of 4 per cent by 1963. That year an even more ambitious Second Programme was introduced, however, it overreached and had to be abandoned. In spite of this the annual growth rate averaged five per cent, the highest achieved since independence. ==Retirement and death== Ryan did not stand in the 1965 general election, after which he was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad \u00c9ireann (the upper house of the Oireachtas), where he joined his son, Eoin Ryan Snr. At the 1969 dissolution he retired to his farm at Kindlestown in County Wicklow, where he died at age 78 on 25 September 1970. His grandson Eoin Ryan Jnr served in the Oireachtas from 1989 and later in the European Parliament until 2009. ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Early Sinn F\u00e9in TDs Category:Ministers for Finance (Ireland) Category:Members of the 1st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 2nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 4th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 5th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 6th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 7th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 8th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 9th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 10th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 11th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 12th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 11th Seanad Category:Members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Wexford constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Politicians from County Wexford Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922 Category:Ministers for Health (Ireland) Category:Ministers for Agriculture (Ireland) Category:Ministers for Social Affairs (Ireland) Category:Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann Category:Fianna F\u00e1il senators Category:People educated at St Peter's College, Wexford ",
