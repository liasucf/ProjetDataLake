The third, as yet unreleased, film in the trilogy, Life of an Artist, examines the 'limits of art'. In Permanent Residence, Hung's character, named Windson, is a straight young man who is befriended by a young gay man, Ivan (played by Sean Li), seeking a long-term relationship. The film is claimed by its director, Scud, to be a largely semi-autobiographical account of his own life.Review of 'Permanent Residence' Unusually for a comparatively well-known performer, and unlike the conventional appearances of adult males in Hong Kong films, Hung appears naked many times in the film, with his private parts fully exposed on camera, together with his co-star Sean Li.Permanent Residence 2009 review Hung later appeared as the character 'Spider' in the 2011 Hong Kong film Love Actually... Sucks!, with his private parts again fully revealed as he walks naked on a mountain top. Hung appeared in the Hong Kong films Infernal Affairs (2002) and Breezy Summer (2004) with fellow members of his Cantopop group EO2. ==Filmography== * He's a Woman, She's a Man (1994) ...
