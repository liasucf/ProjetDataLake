Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller (both of West Virginia) successfully corralling widespread opposition from both Democratic and Republican senators.\"Opposition from Senator Rockefeller and Byrd helps to block vote on Administrations MSHA nominee.\" Senate Website, retrieved August 20, 2007 In remarks at the time, Senator Rockefeller noted that Stickler had overseen \"some of the most dangerous, most frequently cited for safety violations in the entire industry. In fact, his mines had a rate of preventable accidents that were 3 times the national average\". Senator Rockefeller, who had recently marshalled the MINER Act through the Senate to strengthen mine safety regulation, noted that Stickler had testified to Congress that he did not believe more legislation was necessary but rather that enforcement was an issue. Despite resistance from the Senate, and with the nomination being returned twice to his desk unaffirmed, President Bush later appointed Stickler as a recess appointment in October 2006.\"Personnel Announcement\", the White House, October 19, 2006, retrieved August 20, 2007.
