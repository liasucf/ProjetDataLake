    "text": "Microtis oblonga, commonly known as the sweet onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to south-eastern Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty scented, bright green flowers. It is considered by some Australian authorities to be synonymous with Microtis rara. == Description == Microtis oblonga is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty bright green, sweetly scented flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are long, about wide and usually curve forwards. The labellum is oblong, long, wide with irregular edges and turns downward towards the ovary. There is a raised, dark green callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to February. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis oblonga was first formally described in 1923 by Richard Sanders Rogers and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. It is regarded by many Australian authorities as being a synonym of Microtis rara. The specific epithet (oblonga) is a Latin word meaning \"longer than broad\". ==Distribution and habitat== The sweet onion orchid grows between grasses and shrubs in open forest from Gympie in Queensland south through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and west to south-eastern South Australia. == References == == External links == * * oblonga Category:Prasophyllinae Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1923 ",
