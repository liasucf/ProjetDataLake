    "text": "Aftermath is an American thrash band from Chicago, Illinois, United States, which formed in 1985. They have released two studio albums under two monikers and been involved in several compilation projects. They subsequently changed their name to Mother God Moviestar in 1998 after a trademark dispute with Dr. Dre in which the court found that both could use the name. The band reformed as Aftermath in 2015. ==History== Aftermath was a Chicago-based thrash metal band during the 1980s and 1990s. Its demos landed them in metal magazines, including Kerrang!,Kerrang!, December, 1989 and January 1990 Metal Hammer,Metal Hammer, (Greece, January 1995) RIP Magazine,RIP, April 1995 Raw,Raw, September 1989 and Metal Forces.Metal Forces, Issue 57, June 1988, July 1988 Its Words that Echo Fear demo was selected as one of Kerrang! 's Top 10 demos of 1990.Kerrang!, January 6, 1990 The band's debut Eyes of Tomorrow has been released by multiple labels during the years and their demos continue to generate interest and fans around the world evidenced by the two reissues on Shadow Kingdom Records and Divebomb Records. Having reunited in 2015, the band played the Ragnarokkr Metal Apocalypse festival in Chicago in May and Headbanger's Open Air festival in Hamburg, Germany in July. Celebrating 30 years since their formation, the band is reissuing their Eyes of Tomorrow debut cd on Shadow Kingdom Records on September 4, 2015. The remastered version by Paul Logus (Pantera, Anthrax) includes an expanded booklet and four bonus tracks. In October, Divebomb Records will reissue Killing the Future along with five bonus tracks and expanded booklet. Once again remastered by Paul Logus . == Demos == Chicago based Aftermath, fronted by the Greece born Kyriakos \"Charlie\" Tsiolis, formed in October 1985 when Charlie and his schoolmate Steve Sacco (Guitar) got together. This early incarnation with Adam (Bass) and Nick Chiara (Drums) issued their first demo called 'Sentenced To Death' in 1986 featuring 'Sentenced to Death', 'Revenge', 'Shotgun' and 'The Aftermath'. In 1987, they unleashed their second demo entitled \u2018Killing The Future\u2019 featuring the tracks \u2018When Will You Die\u2019, \u2018Going No Place\u2019, \u2018Chaos\u2019, \u2018Meltdown\u2019 and \u2018War For Freedom\u2019. The band pursued a mind blowing speed and technical brand of Thrash that soon set them apart from the pack. The tracks \"War For Freedom\" & \"When Will You Die\" were both featured on the British \u2018Metal Forces\u2019 magazine compilation LP \u2018Demolition: Scream Your Brains Out\u2019 in 1988 Metal Forces. The LP featured tracks from Leviathan (Chris Barnes(Six Feet Under) on Vocals), Hobbs' Angel Of Death, Anacrusis & Atrophy. The appearance on the Metal Forces' compilation further expanded the band's international appeal. By 1988, the musical direction was changing and Adam's raw and simple bass lines would soon be replaced with complex and technical bass parts handled at first by John Lovette. Ironically, John never played bass on any Aftermath recording and wasn't even a bass player. However, he wanted to join the band so badly, he came to the audition with a friend's bass he had just started to play. The speed and complex playing he displayed was something none of the members had ever seen before on bass. He landed the gig that day. When the band decided it was time to add a second guitarist, Lovette told his band mates of his desire to switch to guitar and for the first time he came clean, he was a guitar player pretending to be a bass player all along. His bass playing was surpassed by his guitar skills, the band found its second guitar player, but unfortunately, the search for a bass player was back on. Luckily, the search (for the time being, anyway) ended with Danny Vega. His warm and precise playing was the perfect complement to the guitar playing of Lovette and Sacco and worked amazingly well with Schmidt's powerful drumming. With Lovette handling most of the song writing duties, Aftermath was about to make an unbelievable musical change. By 1989, that change brought on by Lovette's writing and the band's musical tastes and stylings had slowed and matured as evidenced by the release of the underground classic demo \u2018Words That Echo Fear\u2019. == 1990s == As the new decade approached and their international underground success continued to increase, Aftermath was about to embark on the search for yet another bass player (Chris Waldron), label negotiations, label bankruptcy, the recording of their debut and a trademark battle. ==Eyes of Tomorrow saga== In 1990, based on the international success of the Words that Echo Fear demo, the metal label RoadRacer Records (a subsidiary of Roadrunner Records) approached the band for a demo deal, which resulted in a live four track demo featuring the songs \u2018Eyes of Tomorrow\u2019, \u2018Afraid Of Time\u2019, \u2018The Act Of Unspoken Wisdom\u2019 and 'Reflecting Pictures\". Negotiations eventually broke down and Aftermath signed to New York City\u2019s Big Chief Records. The label's collapse halfway through the recording sessions led to a long delay in finishing the record. While the band struggled to pay the studio bill, the album the band started to record in 1990 would not see the light of day for four years. The experience left the band reeling and forced them to issue the album under their own steam with the help of their manager through Zoid Recordings in 1994. Four long years had passed since the initial recordings for the record \"Eyes Of Tomorrow\" and the scene had changed. The album was subsequently re-released on Thermometer Sound Surface / Zoid and released yet again four years later on Black Lotus Records in a remastered version. Area Death Productions remastered the record once again as part of their box set called 25 Years of Chaos released in 2011. In 2015, Shadow Kingdom Records reissued the record with bonus tracks as part of a 2-CD set with expanded artwork, new cover art treatment and remastered by Paul Logus. ==Trademark dispute== Aftermath the act, lost a notable court case Tsiolis v. Interscope. Records. Inc., 946 F.Supp. 1344, 1349 (N.D.III. 1996) with Dr. Dre over the ownership of the name. Dre reported made a conciliatory offer of some $50,000 for rights to use the name but would go ahead and use it regardless.NewCity, December, 1996 Fortunately for the band, this period of turmoil had built bridges with Interscope Records. After the name change to Mother God Moviestar, they signed to Interscope for the eponymous Electro- Metal debut of March 1998. The case has been studied in law schools around the nation related to the issue of trademark dilution. == Legal battle and Mother God Moviestar == In January 1997 the group, retaining a stable lineup but augmenting their sound with the addition of DJ Delta 9 and female vocalist Roxanne, retitled themselves Mother God Moviestar, opting to pursue an alternative rock direction. Aftermath has continued to receive critical acclaim as one of the major influences in the genre. The band is featured in Gary Sharpe-Young's A - Z of Thrash Metal. ==Discography== ;Demos *Sentenced To Death (1986) *Killing the Future (1987) *Words that Echo Fear (1989) ;Compilations *Metal Forces' Scream Your Brains Out ;Full-length *Eyes of Tomorrow (1994) Re-issued *mother god moviestar (Interscope) 1998 under the name mother god moviestar *There is Something Wrong (2019) ;2010 and 2011 releases *25 Years of Chaos - Box Set (Area Death Productions) (2010\u201311) *When Will You Die (1986\u20131989) Vinyl (F.O.A.D Records) (2011) ;2015 releases *Eyes of Tomorrow (Shadow Kingdom Records) September 4, 2015 Remastered by Paul Logus (Pantera.
