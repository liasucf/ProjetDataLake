    "text": "\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was the second single released by the English rock band the Who in 1965. It features call-and-response lyrics (especially common in Who lyrics at this time) and some of the first ever recorded guitar feedback. The song was composed by lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the only time they wrote together. The guitar feedback, although not the first to be heard on a record (see the Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\"), is thought to be the first solo with feedback. This is the first Who release with Nicky Hopkins playing piano. == Overview == === Composition === \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" has a significant similarity to \"Out in the Street\", which appears on their debut album My Generation. Both songs feature a three-chord strum before \"blasting into an uptempo rhythm\"; Despite this, \"Out in the Street\" is a marginally older song, and both tracks originate from the same recording sessions between 13 and 14 April 1965. The use of feedback throughout the song was crucial, according to Townshend, who stated that the group \"were trying to achieve the sound which we get on the stage at present, all in a commercial song that will sell.\" He would later claim that \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was an attempt to write a very spiritual song. Brett Milano of udiscovermusic.com rated Townsend's guitar solo as one of the 100 all-time greatest, \"cramming all kinds of great noises \u2013 feedback, air-raid sirens, and good old guitar destruction \u2013 into the brief space he had.\" === Release === \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was released on 21 May 1965 with \"Daddy Rolling Stone\", written by Otis Blackwell, on the B-Side. The release coincided with an appearance on Ready Steady Go! by the group, in which they perform this and \"Shout and Shimmy\". \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" fitted the mood of Ready Steady Go! so well that the show adapted it as their intro for a while. In the US, the feedback present in the recording startled Decca Records, who believed they'd received a faulty tape of the song. The song was released on 5 June 1965 in the US. \"Daddy Rolling Stone\" was replaced by \"Anytime You Want Me\" for this release. The single became the Who's second top-ten single after \"I Can't Explain\", reaching number ten on the UK Singles Chart. It remained in the top forty for eleven weeks, with six weeks in the top twenty, and one in the top ten. It also became a top forty single in France, reaching number thirty-eight, but it failed to match the success that \"I Can't Explain\" had in the US: whereas that was a top-hundred hit (peaking at 93), \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It sold approximately eighty-eight thousand copies in the UK. The song was rarely played live for most of The Who's career past 1965, but since 1999 has become a staple for their live shows; it appears on the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall. It can also be found on BBC Sessions and The Kids Are Alright. == Personnel == The Who * Roger Daltrey \u2013 lead vocals * Pete Townshend \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals * John Entwistle \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * Keith Moon \u2013 drums Additional musicians * Nicky Hopkins \u2013 piano ==Other versions== David Bowie recorded a version of this song for his Pin Ups album in 1973.
