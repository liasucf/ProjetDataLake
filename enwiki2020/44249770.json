    "text": "Para\u00edso Bay is a group of four adjacent high-rises under construction in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida, United States. Two of the towers will be nearly identical, rising about with 54 floors. Construction of the twin towers started in July 2014. Several city officials joined in the groundbreaking ceremony, including mayor Tom\u00e1s Regalado. The two preliminary towers as of 2014 were branded ONE Para\u00edso and Para\u00edso Bayviews. Para\u00edso is Spanish for paradise. The Related Group pledged to include a public park as part of the project due to a land swap deal that allowed them to close the end of a city street. The project was formerly approved as Element by a separate developer. ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Miami ==References== Category:Residential skyscrapers in Miami Category:Buildings and structures under construction in the United States ",
