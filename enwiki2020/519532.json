It is the capital of Biberach district, in the Upper Swabia region of the German state (Land) of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It is called Biberach an der Riss after the small river Riss which flows through the city to distinguish it from the other towns of similar names. == Geography == Biberach has a population of about 32,000 and is located in Upper Swabia between the river Danube and Lake Constance.

For many centuries, Biberach was an Imperial Free City () in the Holy Roman Empire. In that role it participated in the 1792 Reichstag. During the Protestant Reformation, Biberach was notable for being \u2014 eventually along only with Ravensburg, Augsburg and Dinkelsb\u00fchl \u2014 a \"Mixed Imperial City\" () where the Peace of Westphalia caused the establishment of a joint Catholic\u2013Protestant government and administrative system, with equality offices () and a precise and equal distribution between Catholic and Protestant civic officials.
