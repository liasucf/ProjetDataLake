The specific epithet (rennieana) honours \"the meritorious Professor of Chemistry in the Adelaide University, Dr. Rennie\". In his review of the genus in 1991, Alex George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Integripetala along with V. helmsii, V. interioris, V. mirabilis and V. picta.George, A.S. (1991) New taxa, combinations and typifications in Verticordia (Myrtaceae: Chamelaucieae).
