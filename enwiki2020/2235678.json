It lies on the Buda (i.e. Western) side of the Danube, to the south of Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa Square, on the northern side of Elisabeth Bridge and to the east of Naphegy. Outside of Budapest, several other Hungarian cities and towns also have districts called Tab\u00e1n. == History == Tab\u00e1n mid-1800s The Tab\u00e1n has been inhabited since Neolithic times, due to its location in a protected valley, the thermal waters at the bottom of the Gell\u00e9rt Hill and the ford over the Danube. In the Iron Age, it was inhabited by a tribe of Celts, who were replaced by the Romans in the 1st century BC. In the Middle Ages, the Tab\u00e1n was a village right under the Buda Castle. Remains of significant medieval structures were discovered by archaeologists in 1936. The Turks developed the thermal medicinal baths in the area and brought immigrants from the Balkans. The population increased after the liberation of Hungary from the Ottomans as refugees came from Greece, Bosnia and Serbia. The Franciscans from Bosnia established the parish church in the 17th century which still exists today and the Orthodox inhabitants established their own parish. The Church of Saint Demetrius was built in 1742-51 in Baroque style; it was the largest church building in the whole Metropolitanate of Karlovci. In the 18th century, the town was inhabited by Serbs, Greeks, Vlachs, Germans, Croats, Slovaks and Gypsies. The history of Tab\u00e1n is inseparable from that of the neighboring Naphegy and Gell\u00e9rthegy districts. In the 19th century, the Tab\u00e1n became known as a Bohemian quarter of Budapest with many restaurants, bars and bordellos. Its narrow streets on the hillsides echoed a Mediterranean atmosphere. Kereszt Street was the center of old Tab\u00e1n. In the 1930s, the Tab\u00e1n was demolished in order to facilitate urban planning in Budapest. Today, it is a park very popular with the population of the capital. ==Topography== After the 1930 urban planning in Budapest, only a few old Tab\u00e1n houses were left in the Naphegy district; one of them was the Tab\u00e1n school, which was destroyed in January 1945, during the battle of Budapest. Today a sports field can be found where the school once stood. The only original streets remaining are Orom Street in Gell\u00e9rthegy and Tab\u00e1n Czak\u00f3 Street in Naphegy. Taban's historic and cultural attractions include a Memorial of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution near Naphegy Street and Kereszt Street and the Semmelweiss Orvost\u00f6rt\u00e9neti M\u00fazeum near Apr\u00f3d Street. ==Tab\u00e1n in literature== The poet Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi wrote: \"K\u00f6r\u00f6ttem - es\u0151s akvarell - Tab\u00e1n.
