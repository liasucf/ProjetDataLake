The first waves of larger-scale Serbian immigration to the country occurred in the 1950s, with immigration continuing to the present day. The community of Serbs in Botswana is an active one, and regularly hosts events at the Serbian Society, which is a cultural center catering to the needs of Botswana Serbs. Serbian Botswanans also have two Serbian Orthodox churches in Gaborone, the church of Saint Sava and the church of Saint Nicholas, construction of which began in 2016. The Saint Sava Orthodox Church operates a school for Serbian Botswanans to teach children the Serbian language and culture.\u201cCorner-Stone for a new Orthodox Church in Botswana.\u201d Regular Session of the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church Begins | Serbian Orthodox Church [Official Web Site], Serbian Orthodox Church, 25 Nov. 2016. ==See also== *Serbian diaspora *Serbs in South Africa *White people in Botswana ==References== ==External links== *Serbian Society of Botswana *History of Serbs in Botswana Category:Botswana people of European descent Category:Ethnic groups in Botswana Botswana ",
