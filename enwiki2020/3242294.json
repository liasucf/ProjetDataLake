    "text": "wpa_supplicant is a free software implementation of an IEEE 802.11i supplicant for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, QNX, AROS, Microsoft Windows, Solaris, OS/2 (including ArcaOS and eComStation) and Haiku. In addition to being a fully featured WPA2 supplicant, it also implements WPA and older wireless LAN security protocols. ==Features== Features include: * WPA and full IEEE 802.11i/RSN/WPA2 * WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK (\"WPA-Personal\", pre-shared key) * WPA with EAP (\"WPA-Enterprise\", for example with RADIUS authentication server) * key management for CCMP, TKIP, WEP (both 104/128- and 40/64-bit) * RSN: PMKSA caching, pre-authentication * IEEE 802.11r * IEEE 802.11w * Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Included with the supplicant are a GUI and a command-line utility for interacting with the running supplicant. From either of these interfaces it is possible to review a list of currently visible networks, select one of them, provide any additional security information needed to authenticate with the network (for example, a passphrase, or username and password) and add it to the preference list to enable automatic reconnection in the future. The graphical user interface is built on top of the Qt library. wpa_supplicant can authenticate with any of the following EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) methods: EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP (both PEAPv0 and PEAPv1), EAP-TTLS, EAP- SIM, EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA', EAP-pwd, EAP-EKE, EAP-PSK (experimental), EAP-FAST, EAP-PAX, EAP-SAKE, EAP-GPSK, EAP-IKEv2, EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPv2, and LEAP (requires special functions in the driver). ==Vulnerability to KRACK== wpa_supplicant was especially susceptible to KRACK, as it can be manipulated to install an all-zeros encryption key, effectively nullifying WPA2 protection in a man-in-the-middle attack. Version 2.7 fixed KRACK and several other vulnerabilities. ==See also== * NetworkManager * Supplicant * Wireless supplicant * Xsupplicant ==References== ==External links== * * wpa_supplicant examples Category:Wi-Fi Category:Wireless networking Category:Software that uses Qt Category:Articles with underscores in the title Category:Software using the BSD license ",
