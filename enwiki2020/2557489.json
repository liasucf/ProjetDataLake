    "text": "Mohamed Abdullaziz Al-Deayea (; born 2 August 1972) is a Saudi Arabian retired football goalkeeper. He played in four FIFA World Cups for the Saudi Arabia national team and earned a total of 178 officially recognized caps, the record for a goalkeeper. He also achieved the first best Goalkeeper of the Century from Asia award ahead of Nasser Hejazi in second and In-Young Choi in third place respectively. ==Club career== Al-Deayea has split his professional career between the clubs Al-Ta'ee and Al-Hilal. Originally he started as a handball player, but was convinced by his club and his older brother Abdullah to become a footballer. Mohammed was under great pressure in the beginning of his career because of having to wear the shoes of his brother Abdullah, who was an AFC Asian Cup winner and a highly reputed goalkeeper too. ==Retirement== On 22 June 2010, Mohamed Al-Deayea announced his retirement from football at the age of 37. On 5 January 2012, a big farewell match was organised between Al-Hilal and Juventus F.C.. 70,000 people were packed in the King Fahd Stadium. The match ended 1\u20137 in favour of Juventus with one goal from Saad Al-Harthi. Juventus's goals were scored by Alessandro Del Piero (twice), Eljero Elia, Arturo Vidal, Giorgio Chiellini, Simone Pepe and Fabio Quagliarella. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|ACL !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"8\"|Al-Ta'ee |1991\u201392 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1992\u201393 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1993\u201394 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1994\u201395 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1995\u201396 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1996\u201397 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1997\u201398 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- |1998\u201399 |22||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||\u2014 |- !Total !!!176!!\u2014!!\u2014!!\u2014!!\u2014!!\u2014!!176!!\u2014 |- | rowspan=\"11\"|Al-Hilal |1999\u201300 |22||\u2014||4||\u2014||7||\u2014||33||\u2014 |- |2000\u201301 |22||\u2014||2||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||24||\u2014 |- |2001\u201302 |22||1||colspan=2|\u2014||5||\u2014||27||1 |- |2002\u201303 |22||1||4||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||26||1 |- |2003\u201304 |22||\u2014||4||\u2014||3||\u2014||29||\u2014 |- |2004\u201305 |22||1||5||\u2014||4||\u2014||31||1 |- |2005\u201306 |22||\u2014||5||\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||27||\u2014 |- |2006\u201307 |21||\u2014||4||\u2014||6||\u2014||31||\u2014 |- |2007\u201308 |21||\u2014||5||\u2014||6||\u2014||32||\u2014 |- |2008\u201309 |21||\u2014||4||\u2014||7||\u2014||32||\u2014 |- |2009\u201310 |20||\u2014||1||\u2014||4||0||25||0 |- !Total !!!230!!3!!38!!0!!39!!0!!310!!3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career Total !413!!3!!38!!0!!39!!0!!493!!3 |} ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Saudi Arabia national team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |1993||16||0 |- |1994||21||0 |- |1995||6||0 |- |1996||21||0 |- |1997||23||0 |- |1998||22||0 |- |1999||15||0 |- |2000||15||0 |- |2001||12||0 |- |2002||13||0 |- |2003||0||0 |- |2004||4||0 |- |2005||0||0 |- |2006||8||0 |- !Total||178||0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Al-Ta'ee *Saudi First Division: 1994\u201395 Al-Hilal *Saudi Premier League: 2001\u201302, 2004\u201305, 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 *Saudi Crown Prince Cup: 1999\u20132000, 2003, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310 *Saudi Founder's Cup: 1999 *AFC Champions League: 1999\u20132000 *Asian Cup Winners Cup: 2001\u201302 *Asian Super Cup: 2000 *Arab Cup Winners' Cup: 2000 *Arab Super Cup: 2001 ===International=== Saudi Arabia U-17 *FIFA U-17 World Cup: 1989 Saudi Arabia *AFC Asian Cup: 1996 *Gulf Cup of Nations: 1994, 2003 *Arab Nations Cup: 1998 *Islamic Solidarity Games: 2005 ===Individual=== *Best Goalkeeper of the AFC Asian Cup: 1996, 2000 *Best Goalkeeper of the Gulf Cup of Nations: 1998, 2002 *Best Goalkeeper of the GCC Champions League: 2000 *Best Goalkeeper of the Arab Champions League': 2001 *Best Goalkeeper of the Asian Cup Winners Cup: 2002 *He was voted Asia's Goalkeeper of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 1999. ==References== ==External links== *Detail of international appearances \u2013 by RSSSF * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ha'il Category:Saudi Arabian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Al-Tai FC players Category:Al Hilal SFC players Category:Saudi Professional League players Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:Asian Games competitors for Saudi Arabia Category:Saudi Arabia international footballers Category:Footballers at the 1990 Asian Games Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:1995 King Fahd Cup players Category:1996 AFC Asian Cup players Category:1997 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:1999 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2000 AFC Asian Cup players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:AFC Asian Cup-winning players Category:FIFA Century Club ",
