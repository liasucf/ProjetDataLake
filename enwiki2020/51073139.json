    "text": "The NWA United States Tag Team Championship was a professional wrestling tag team championship in Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling (GCCW). A secondary title after the NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship, it was one of many U.S. tag team championships recognized by the National Wrestling Alliance. It was unified with the NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Tri-State version) on April 15, 1974. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name, while others used their real name. There have been a total of 37 recognized individual champions and 25 recognized teams, who have had a combined 39 official reigns. The first champions were The Dirty Daltons (Jack Dalton and Jim Dalton), and the final champions were \"Cowboy\" Bob Kelly and Rocket Monroe. At 300 days, The Dirty Daltons' first reign was the longest, while the team of Mike Boyette and The Wrestling Pro's second reign was the shortest, at less than one day. The team with the most reigns is The Dalton Brothers (Jack Dalton and Frank Dalton) with five. Mike Boyette has the most individual reigns with seven. The following is a chronological list of teams that have been United States Tag Team Champions by ring name. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reigns |The number of times a specific set of wrestlers have won the titles |- |Event |The event promoted by the respective promotion in which the titles were won |- |N/A |The information is not available. |- | Wrestler name (#) | The number represents the number of times the wrestler has held the title individually |- | \u2014 | Used for vacated reigns in order to not count it as an official reign |} ==Title history== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" width=100% !width=0 data-sort- type=\"number\" scope=\"col\"|No. !width=14% scope=\"col\"|Champions !width=0 scope=\"col\"|Reign !width=16% scope=\"col\"|Date !width=0 data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\"|Days held !width=14% scope=\"col\"|Location !width=17% scope=\"col\"|Event !width=51% class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\"|Notes !width=0 class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\"| |- !scope=row|1 | |1 | | |N/A |House show |align=left|Billed as champions upon arrival in the territory.
