    "text": "Henri Valentino in 1836 Henri Valentino (14 October 1785 \u2013 28 January 1865). According to , the exact date of his death is uncertain. and give 1787 as his year of birth. was a French conductor and violinist. From 1824 to 1832, he was co-conductor (with Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck) of the Paris Opera, where he prepared and conducted the premieres of the first two grand operas, Auber's La muette de Portici and Rossini's Guillaume Tell. From 1832 to 1836, he was First Conductor of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, and from 1837 to 1841, conductor of classical music at the Concerts Valentino in a hall on the rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris. == Early life and career == He was born Henri-Justin-Armand-Joseph Valentino in Lille. His father was an Italian army pharmacist, who wanted his son to become a soldier, but Henri exhibited such a great talent for music, he was allowed to pursue that instead. At twelve he was playing violin in the local theatre (probably in Lille), and at fourteen was asked to substitute for a conductor on short notice, thereafter mainly dedicating himself to conducting. Later he conducted in Rouen. == At the Paris Opera == In 1813 in Metz, Valentino married the niece of the composer Louis-Luc Loiseau de Persuis,; ; . who at that time was also the chief conductor of the Paris Opera Orchestra.. Persuis held the post of First Conductor from 1810 to 1819. In April 1817, Persuis also took on the duties of R\u00e9gisseur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la sc\u00e8ne et du personnel des artistes [General Director of Scenery and Artistic Personnel], which he held until 13 November 1819, when it was taken over by Giovanni Viotti (). Persuis died on 20 December 1819, and Rodolphe Kreutzer, who had been a deputy conductor since 1816, was named chief conductor in January 1820. Valentino was appointed deputy conductor under Kreutzer on 1 April. (1 April 1820); (\"after the death of Persuis, that is to say, in 1820\"); gives the date as 1818. Valentino was \"rewarded with the reversion of the title of first conductor conjointly with [Fran\u00e7ois] Habeneck\" in August. (quote); (Valentino becomes chef d'orchestre adjoint en titre, sharing with Habeneck, in August 1820). The decree did not take effect until Kreutzer's resignation on 1 December 1824, \"when the two deputies had long been exercising the function of conductor in turn.\" (quote); (Kreutzer's exact retirement date of 1 December 1824). Each of them was responsible for different new productions, that is, the conducting of the rehearsals and performances needed to bring a new work before the public. Among the premieres conducted by Valentino at the Paris Opera are the following works:All were performed at the Salle Le Peletier. * Olympie, 3-act opera (revised version) by Gaspare Spontini, 27 February 1826Autograph letter from Spontini to Valentino (Paris, 1 March 1826), thanking him for conducting the orchestra (BnF catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral - Notice bibliographique). says Valentino conducted Olimpie (as a \"new\" work), but does not give the date. , states that Valentino conducted the premiere of the original version on 22 December 1819, possibly an error. * Mo\u00efse, 4-act opera by Gioachino Rossini, 26 March 1827Manuscript letter (Paris, 2 April 1827) with the autograph signature of Rossini, addressed to \"Monsieur Valentino, Directeur de l'Orchestre de l'Academie R. de musique\", thanking him for conducting Mo\u00efse (BnF catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral - Notice bibliographique); . Mo\u00efse is a heavily revised French adaptation of Rossini's Mos\u00e8 in Egitto. * La muette de Portici, 5-act opera by Daniel Auber, 29 February 1828; ; ; . Other sources credit Habeneck as the conductor: ; . * Guillaume Tell, 4-act opera by Rossini, 3 August 1829Manuscript letter with Rossini's autograph signature from Rossini to Valentino (Paris, 9 August 1829), thanking Valentino for preparing and conducting the orchestra (BnF catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral - Notice bibliographique); , p. 211; ; ; ; . Some authors have credited Habeneck as the conductor: ; ; ; ; . * Le dieu et la bayad\u00e8re, 2-act opera by Auber, 13 October 1830; . * Le serment, ou Les faux-monnayeurst, 3-act opera by Auber, 1 October 1832; . The French music historian Arthur Pougin describes Valentino as a conductor of the first rank: > Gifted with a talent at once energetic and supple, meticulous of small > details, capably inspiring the confidence and respect of all who were placed > under him, he excited not only the admiration of the public, but that of the > singers, dancers, choristers, and orchestral players. Moreover, his kindly > nature and integrity, his firmness and fair-mindedness won him general favor > and gave him great moral authority.: \"Dou\u00e9 d'un talent \u00e0 la fois \u00e9nergique > et souple, soigneux des moindres d\u00e9tails, sachant inspirer la confiance et > le respect \u00e0 tous ceux qui \u00e9taient plac\u00e9s sous ses ordres, il excitait non- > seulement l'admiration du public, mais celle de tous les artistes du chant, > de la danse, des choeurs et de l'orchestre. D'autre part, sa nature > bienveillante et droite, son caract\u00e8re ferme et juste lui conciliaient les > sympathies g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et lui donnaient une grande autorit\u00e9 morale.\" == Premiere of the Messe solennelle by Berlioz == Late in 1824, Valentino had applied for the post of conductor at the Chapel Royale, where he was already a violinist. The co-director of the Chapel, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Le Sueur, had a young student, Hector Berlioz, who was composing a mass (his Messe solennelle), intended for the Church of Saint-Roch in Paris. The forces required for performing the work were so large, that both he and his teacher believed it needed a great conductor. Realizing that the situation improved their chances of a positive response, they approached Valentino, who, after inspecting the score, agreed to conduct, despite having serious doubts concerning the quality of the players and singers that he might have at his disposal. The performance was set for 28 December. Unfortunately, the general rehearsal, held the day before the scheduled concert, was a disaster: many of the amateur musicians engaged by the church failed to appear, and the instrumental parts, copied by the choirboys, were full of errors, so the premiere had to be postponed. Despite the problems, Valentino encouraged Berlioz to persevere and promised to conduct, if conditions could be improved. Berlioz revised his score, copied out the parts himself, and managed to obtain a loan, enabling him to hire the Paris Opera orchestra, augmented with the best players from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre- Italien. The performance, conducted by Valentino on 10 June, was an undisputed success.; In 1824 Valentino was made the Chapel Royale orchestra's Second Conductor, under Charles-Henri Plantade, and was designated Plantade's heir apparent. Valentino never was able to take advantage of this privilege, however, since Plantade was still the First Conductor, when the monarchy was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830. == Departure from the Paris Opera == Spontini's 3-act opera Olympie was initially rehearsed by Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck, but at one of the general rehearsals Spontini and Habeneck argued violently, and Valentino was asked to take over, replacing Habeneck as conductor in the further preparations for the performance of the opera. Pougin suggests that Habeneck likely developed a grudge against Valentino; that this was not without consequence several years later when Valentino chose to retire under pressure from management, and \"it was precisely the rectitude and firmness of his character which became the cause, or at least the pretext, of his departure from the Op\u00e9ra.\u201d: \"C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la droiture el fermet\u00e9 de son caract\u00e8re qui devinrent la cause, ou tout au moins le pr\u00e9texte, de son d\u00e9part de l'Op\u00e9ra.\" After the establishment of the July Monarchy in 1830, the administration of the Opera was radically changed: on 1 March 1831, it ceased being an enterprise of the state and was entrusted to a director/entrepreneur, who was to run it \"at his own risks, perils, and fortune\".: \"\u00e0 ses risques, p\u00e9rils et fortune\" (cahier des charges du directeur, 28 February 1831). Louis V\u00e9ron, who assumed this responsibility, needed to reduce expenditures and decided to lower the salaries of the weaker members of the orchestra. Valentino, unwilling to subscribe to a measure he considered unfair, decided to take advantage of an offer to become chief conductor of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique.; . == At the Op\u00e9ra-Comique == Valentino officially became First Conductor of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 1 October 1832.. Among the premieres he conducted for the company are the following works:All were performed at the Salle de la Bourse, except for Zampa, which was given at the Salle Ventadour. * Zampa, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Ferdinand H\u00e9rold, 3 May 1831; . * Le pr\u00e9 aux clercs, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Ferdinand H\u00e9rold, 15 December 1832 * Le prison d'\u00c9dimbourg, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Michele Carafa, 20 July 1833 * Lestocq, 4-act op\u00e9ra- comique by Daniel Auber, 24 May 1834 * Le chalet, 1-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Adolphe Adam, 25 September 1834 * Robin des bois, 3-act op\u00e9ra romantique by Carl Maria von Weber (Der Freisch\u00fctz, adapted by Castil-Blaze), 15 January 1835 * Le cheval de bronze, 3-act op\u00e9ra-f\u00e9erie by Daniel Auber, 23 March 1835 * L'\u00e9clair, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Fromental Hal\u00e9vy, 16 December 1835 * Act\u00e9on, 1-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Daniel Auber, 23 January 1836; ; . * Les chaperons blancs, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Daniel Auber, 9 April 1836; . * Le postillon de Lonjumeau, 3-act op\u00e9ra-comique by Adolphe Adam, 13 October 1836; . According to the music historian Gustave Chouquet, in his article on Valentino in the 1889 volume of A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \"on all these popular works [Valentino] bestowed a care, zeal, and attention to nuances beyond all praise.\" ===Offenbach=== In Valentino's final year at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Jacques Offenbach became a cellist in the orchestra. Siegfried Kracauer, in his biography of Offenbach, recounts an unverifiable anecdote concerning the latter's shenanigans, arising from his boredom with having to repeat the same repertory night after night: > In order to make life a little brighter, he [Offenbach] started indulging in > practical jokes, in which [Hippolyte] Seligmann [a fellow cellist] > occasionally joined him. For instance, instead of following the score as > they should have done, each would play alternate notes; or Offenbach would > secretly tie several chairs and music stands together and then make them > dance during the performance. The disadvantage of all this, however, was > that M. Valentino, the conductor, had a strong sense of discipline. > Offenbach's salary was eighty-three francs a month, and for disciplinary > reasons and also, perhaps, for educative ones, Valentino would fine the > culprit for each offense. Offenbach regarded boredom as the greater evil, so > his salary often shrank to an alarming degree.. , repeats the portion of > this story having to do with Offenbach and Seligmann playing alternate notes > and quotes , pp. 4\u20135, who describes it as a \"steeplechase of a new genre\". == Concerts Valentino == Valentino retired from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 1 April 1836 and moved to Chantilly, but the following year, on 15 October 1837, he inaugurated a concert series in a hall at 247\u2013251 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris,, p. 619. See also the article Bal Valentino in the French Wikipedia. where Philippe Musard had held concerts of dance music and masked balls. Valentino's intent was to offer an alternative to the Concerts of the Conservatoire (conducted by Habeneck) and to expand the audience for \"high-class\" instrumental music. Known as the Concerts de la rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 and as the Concerts Valentino, the programs combined instrumental pieces by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, as well as turn-of-the-century French composers. There were also quadrilles, waltzes, and contredances directed by Charles-Alexandre Fessy and Dufresne. The concerts were popular, but the orchestra was always close to insolvency. The 1839 season was cut short, and the final concert was in April 1841. (The series was shut down by order of the government, according to the Revue et Gazette musicale.) Afterwards the hall was used as a ballroom, but was still referred to as the .; ; . In 1839 Valentino went to London, where he gave concerts at the Crown and Anchor Inn., p. 806 (Appendix). ===Wagner's Columbus overture=== On 4 February 1841, as part of the Concerts on the rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, Valentino conducted an all German program, which began with Wagner's Columbus overture. This work, composed 1834\u20131835 in Magdeburg for a play by Wagner's friend , called for six accomplished trumpet players, which the orchestra did not have. A cornettist, whom Wagner consulted, promised four, if Wagner would re-write the parts, although only two of these players were considered satisfactory. At the rehearsal Wagner found they were unable to play soft high notes without \"cracking\". Furthermore, Valentino and the rest of the orchestra made it clear they found the work \"crazy\". Perhaps unsurprisingly, the performance was a failure, and Wagner blamed the trumpets, although he also hints that the audience may have been bored by the piece. According to the German painter and historian , the overture was hissed. During Wagner's two-and-a-half-year stay in Paris, this was the only work of his that he heard performed. On 28 December 1841, an article in Leipzig's Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik attacked Rossini's Stabat Mater, which was to be premiered at the Salle Ventadour in Paris on 7 January 1842. Although the article was written by Wagner, it was signed \"H. Valentino\". Wagner's biographer Ernest Newman writes: \"It was inevitable that many readers of the article should regard it as coming from [Henri Valentino], and it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Wagner maliciously intended to create that impression\". == Later life == After the demise of the Concerts Saint-Honor\u00e9, Valentino retired to Versailles. In 1846 L\u00e9on Pillet, director of the Paris Opera, offered him 15,000 francs per year to succeed the ailing Habeneck as the conductor of the Opera orchestra, but he declined. Valentino, who had remarried, continued living in obscurity with family and friends in Versailles, and he died there in 1865. == Notes == == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == Category:1785 births Category:1865 deaths Category:French conductors (music) Category:French male conductors (music) Category:French people of Italian descent ",
