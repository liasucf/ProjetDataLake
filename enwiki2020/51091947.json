Joe Leydon of Variety called the film \"most fascinating as it tactfully charts the sort of artistic and philosophical differences that can eventually undermine any group endeavor, even among seemingly like-minded collaborators.\" Nicolas Rapold of the New York Times notes \"Meatto\u2019s framing tends to catch the musicians\u2019 give- and-take, merging and dueling notes onstage, especially at a Manhattan concert that is the film\u2019s highlight.\" Joan Radell of Paste Magazine called the film \"masterful filmmaking\" and named the film one of the 10 Best Music Documentaries of 2012 New York Magazine named the film a \"Critic's Pick\" noting that \"the music is both challenging and heavenly\". Dustin Ogdin wrote for No Depression \"HTGAB is not just a film of concert footage or a \"behind the scenes\" clip collection\"; it is a portrait of the creative process.\". Some other reviews of the film were less favorable. Slant Magazine writer Joseph Jon Lanthier noted that \"One can\u2019t speak of Mark Meatto\u2019s documentary profile, How to Grow a Band, without starting squarely with Thile, because the movie is unsurprisingly devoted to peddling the up-and-comer as something daring, something new.\". Marshall Fine of Hollywood & Fine said \"'How to Grow a Band' misses its chance to enlighten, choosing instead to promote. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 films Category:Documentary films about music and musicians ",
