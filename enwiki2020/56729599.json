    "text": "Nakama (initiated 2015 in Oslo, Norway) is a Norwegian five-piece jazz ensemble led by the Norwegian bassist Christian Meaas Svendsen. == Biography == Nakama is Japanese meaning \"comrade\", or a community of people where no one is above the other. The group was founded as a quartet in 2015 but expanded to quintet late 2016. Their music is influenced by European jazz, early American contemporary music, Japanese traditional music, and the harmonies of the romantic classical era. Furthermore, the music intimately explores the relation between content and non-content, and the possibilities of working with flexible forms on a fixed musical material. == Band members == * Adrian L\u00f8seth Waade \u2013 violin * Agnes Hvizdalek \u2013 vocals * Andreas Wildhagen \u2013 drums * Ayumi Tanaka \u2013 piano * Christian Meaas Svendsen \u2013 upright bass == Discogs == * 2015: Before The Storm (Nakama Records) * 2016: Grand Line (Nakama Records) * 2016: Most Intimate (Nakama Records) * 2017: Worst Generation (Nakama Records) == References == == External links == * Category:Musical groups from Oslo Category:Norwegian jazz ensembles Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Norway ",
