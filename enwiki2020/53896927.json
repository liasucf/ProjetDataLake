    "text": "Navajo Mountain High School is a senior high school in Navajo Mountain, an unincorporated area in San Juan County, Utah and within the Navajo Nation. The school, a part of the San Juan School District, uses an Arizona mailing address. It is located in a low income area away from the closest gas station; the Navajo Mountain Chapter stated that Navajo Mountain is the most isolated community in the entire Navajo Nation. ==History== The number of staff declined after the Great Recession of 2008 even though the student body increased slightly; there were seven full-time staff members in 2009, while in 2014 there were three full-time staff members and a part-time counselor. By 2017 the school formed a robotics team and entered its first robotics contest. ==Student body and staff== the entire student body was Native American. Most of the 33 students were entirely of Navajo ancestry. A portion of the student body was made up of some who were entirely of Paiute ancestry. Some students had mixed ancestry of Navajo and Hopi and others had mixed ancestry of Navajo and Paiute. Around 33% of the students were classified as homeless, and 31 of the 33 students were enrolled in free or reduced lunch programs. As of that year, one staff member was both an administrator and a teacher, and there were two other teachers who worked full-time as well as a part-time counselor. In 2009 all of the school staff were full-time: one principal, one counselor, and five teachers. ==References== ==External links== * Navajo Mountain High School Category:Schools in San Juan County, Utah Category:Public high schools in Utah ",
