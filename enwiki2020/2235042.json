    "text": "Pandemonium is a 1990 album by The Time. Much like the three previous albums, the album consists of music in the funk-pop or ballad genre, although this album breaks the Time's six-song album tradition. The album is a tie-in with the film Graffiti Bridge, and several songs from the album appear in the film. According to biographer Matt Thorne, Prince co-wrote \"Donald Trump (Black Version)\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA and \"Jerk Out\" became one of the band's biggest singles. The second single, \"Chocolate\" didn't fare as well. ==Track listing== #\"Dreamland\" \u2013 3:08 (Prince) #\"Pandemonium\" \u2013 4:11 (Harris, Johnson, Lewis, Prince) #\"Sexy Socialites\" \u2013 0:23 #\"Jerk Out\" \u2013 6:49 (Day, Harris, Lewis, Prince) #\"Yount\" \u2013 0:22 #\"Blondie\" \u2013 6:27 (Harris, Johnson, Lewis) #\"Donald Trump (Black Version)\" \u2013 4:33 (Prince) #\"Chocolate\" \u2013 7:31 (Prince) #\"Cooking Class\" \u2013 0:42 (Prince) #\"Skillet\" \u2013 6:11 (Harris, Johnson, Lewis) #\"It's Your World\" \u2013 5:25 (Harris, Lewis) #\"Sometimes I Get Lonely\" \u2013 6:15 (Day, Harris, Lewis, Moir) #\"Data Bank\" \u2013 5:36 (Prince) #\"My Summertime Thang\" \u2013 6:52 (Prince) #\"Pretty Little Women\" \u2013 0:46 ==Reception== \"The songs' obsessions with sex, food and time scream 'concept',\" remarked Michele Kirsch in a 4 out of 5 review for Select, \"but only in a fun, sexy, blaxploitation movie soundtrack kind of way.
