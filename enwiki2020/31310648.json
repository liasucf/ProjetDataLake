    "text": "Loreto House was established in 1842 in Calcutta, by the Sisters of Loreto belonging to the institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is the oldest and the first Loreto institution to be established in India and was one of the few all-girls Catholic schools of that time. The School started with sixty students who were taught at a house where nuns lived under Mother Delphine Hart, assisted by Sr. Teresa Mons and Sr. Martina McCann. The School was initially established for the education of Catholic girls. However, it has long admitted students of many religious beliefs. Currently it is headed by Sister Phyllis. The school is known for hosting annual events like 'We Care' and their popular bi-annual 'Big Fete'.
