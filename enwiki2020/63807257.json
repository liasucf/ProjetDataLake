She continues to supervise the doctoral course in music therapy at the University of M\u00fcnster.Interview der Andreas-Tobias- Kind-Stiftung. Retrieved 29 April 2020 Her research focuses on music in fairy tales, qualitative research methods of artistic therapies as well as topics of music therapy and music psychology from a morphological and psychoanalytical perspective. In the work Musik im M\u00e4rchen, published in 2011, T\u00fcpker presented the results of more than ten years of research on the occurrence and significance of music in European folk tales. Cultural-historical, musicological and psychological questions were examined by comparing over three hundred fairy tales. In addition to statements on the musical instruments used, the perception of music as a profession, different fairy tale traditions, typical playing situations and the gender question, an interpretation pattern/typification of the motives was presented, while content analysis was developed from the text material of the fairy tale.Rezension Monika N\u00f6cker-Ribaupierre in Socialnet, retrieved on 29 April 2020 The types found are named as: Music as outwardly and inwardly moving, creation of a mental space, music as the connecting link between two worlds, music as the foreign, music as desired, music and healing, music transforms, music as witness, music and identity. At the same time, references to today's understanding of music will be established. A more detailed indepth psychology analysis is devoted to the Brothers Grimms' fairy tales: Das Eselein and two fairy tales of Sinti and Romani people: The Creation of the Violin and Der Sohn k\u00e4mpft gegen den Vater (The Son Fights Against the Father). The investigations show the diversity of the concept of music in fairy tales and the clear traces of cultural and historical changes. To date, the final register of the 329 fairy tales studied represents the most comprehensive collection of European fairy tales in which music appears. The theoretical background of the investigation was formed by Wilhelm Salber's morphological psychology and the psychoanalysis according to Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung, the newer psychoanalytic concepts of developmental psychology, self psychology and culture theory.Rezension Michael Tillmann in Psyche, November 2013, 67th year, Heft 11, == Publications == * Spielr\u00e4ume der Musiktherapie.Spielr\u00e4ume der Musiktherapie on WorldCat (ed.)
