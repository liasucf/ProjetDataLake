    "text": "The Hell\u2013Sunnan Line () is a railway line between Hell, Stj\u00f8rdal and Sunnan, Steinkjer in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Norway. The name is no longer in official use and the line is now considered part of the Nordland Line. The Hell\u2013Sunnan Line branches from the Mer\u00e5ker Line at Hell and runs on the east shore of the Trondheimsfjord passing through the municipalities of Stj\u00f8rdal, Levanger, Verdal, Inder\u00f8y and Steinkjer. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) started construction in 1899 and the first part of the line, from Hell to Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen, opened on 1 February 1902. The railway opened to Levanger on 29 October 1902, to Verdals\u00f8ra on 1 November 1904 and to Sunnan on 15 November 1905. Sunnan was chosen as terminus because of its location on the southern end of the lake of Sn\u00e5savatnet. The line was further extended to Sn\u00e5sa in 1926, after which it has been classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway is the most heavily trafficked non-electrified line in Norway, with the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail running south of Steinkjer. It is also used by intercity passenger and freight trains. ==Route== Map of the Hell\u2013Sunnan Line The Hell\u2013Sunnan Line constitutes the section of the Nordland Line between Hell, Stj\u00f8rdal and Sunnan, Steinkjer.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 5 At the time of the line's opening, it was long.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 44 The railway is single track,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 6 standard gauge, non-electrified,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 4 and equipped with centralized traffic control,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 37 partial automatic train control,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 40 and GSM-R.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 42 The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 3 Starting in the south at Hell Station, which is located from Trondheim Central Station (Trondheim S), the Mer\u00e5ker Line branches from the Nordland Line. The latter crosses the river of Stj\u00f8rdalselva on a truss bridge. It passes the closed Sandferhus Station before reaching Trondheim Airport Station ( from Trondheim S), which serves as an airport rail link and is situated below the terminal of Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 95 Previously there was a spur from Sandferhus to V\u00e6rnes and \u00d8yanmoen.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 92 The mainline continues under the airport's taxiway and runway in the two V\u00e6rnes Tunnels, the latter which is long, after which the line reaches Stj\u00f8rdal Station (). The line continues past the closed Vold Station, which was built to serve a mill,Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 27 to Skatval, through which the line makes a semi-circular detour.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 93 Here it serves Skatval Station () and the closed Alstad Station. Alstad was previously an important station as it was conveniently placed for boat access from Frosta.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 29 Located at above mean sea level (AMSL), it was the highest elevated station on the line. The line then enters the municipality of Levanger, where it first reaches the closed Langstein Station and then the closed Vudu Station. After Vudu, the line reaches its highest elevation of when it crosses over European Road 6 (E6). The line then reaches \u00c5sen Station () before continuing past the closed Hammerberg Station to Ronglan Station (). Before reaching Skogn Station (), a spur branches off to Fiborgtangen, serving Norske Skog Skogn. The mainline continues past Eggen Station and over the E6, past the closed Sykehuset Levanger Station, which served Levanger Hospital, before reaching Levanger Station (). It then crosses the river Levangselva on a bridge. It passes the closed Elberg Station and to reach HiNT Station (), which serves the Levanger campus of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College. Class 93 train passing through the V\u00e6rnes Tunnel under Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes' taxiway The line continues past the closed \u00d8stborg Station and Rinnan Station before entering the municipality of Verdal. After Bergsgrav Station (), which serves the neighborhood of Vinne, a spur branches off to Verdal's industrial area. The mainline crosses the river of Verdalselva on a truss bridge before reaching Verdal Station (). It is followed by the closed Fleskhus Station and Bj\u00f8rga Station before entering the municipality of Inder\u00f8y at the Koabj\u00f8rgen Tunnel. The only station in Inder\u00f8y is R\u00f8ra Station (); however the line does not enter Steinkjer before passing through the Lunnan Tunnel. After passing the closed Vollan Station, the line reaches Sparbu Station (). It then passes the closed M\u00e6re Station and Vist Station and crosses over the bridge over Figgja to reach Steinkjer Station (). The line runs over the river of Steinkjerelva on a truss bridge. Then come two spurs, to Eggebogen and Byafossen. The line continues past the closed Byafossen Station and Fossemvatnet Station and terminates at the closed Sunnan Station (). The Nordland Line continues over a bridge across Sn\u00e5savatnet. ==History== ===Planning=== Planning of a railway to connect Tr\u00f8ndelag and J\u00e4mtland, Sweden, started in 1869, with one of the proposals being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden.R\u00f8e (1982): 10\u201311 However, surveys along the Verdal proposed route deemed it unsuitable,R\u00f8e (1982): 12\u201313 and instead the line was built via Stj\u00f8rdalen and Mer\u00e5ker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of the in Norway more common narrow gauge.R\u00f8e (1982): 14\u201315 The Mer\u00e5ker Line opened on 22 July 1882. In Stj\u00f8rdal, controversy arose over the route. The river of Stj\u00f8rdalselva creates a barrier just north of Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen, on the north shore of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town an around 3 kilometres (2 miles) route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway.Museumskart 116: Deler av Trondhimsfjorden: Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag,S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag (1897) This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line.R\u00f8e (1982): 16\u201317 With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.R\u00f8e (1982): 44\u201346 The Nordland Line was first publicly proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen in a letter to the editor in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he argued for a railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 14 The same year, Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 15 The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875,Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 18 who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line,Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 19 which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard \u00d8verland, made a new proposal.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 20 However, it was not until 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 21 Stj\u00f8rdalselva Bridge in 1927 In 1891, the county's road committee, led by \u00d8verland, sent an official request to the railway committee, asking for details about their plans, so the appropriate roads could be planned. This spurred the committees work and a cooperation with Nordland County Council was initiated to increase the projects priority by national politicians.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 22 On 2 March 1896, with 87 against 27 votes, Parliament passed legislation approving a railway from Hell to Sunnan. Costs were estimated at 8.75 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 15 percent was to be financed with local grants and the remainder by the state. Construction was scheduled to take 15 years. The decision initially called for the railway to be built in two stages, with the split at Rinnan in Levanger\u2014the site of the military camp Rinnleiret.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 23 Final approval of construction was made by Parliament on 11 June 1898.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 24 ===Construction=== At Hell, there arose a disagreement about where the Hell\u2013Sunnan Line should branch from the Mer\u00e5ker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at Hell was also too small for the increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at Hell.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 26 In Skatval, there was a controversy as to whether the station should be built at M\u00e6hre or Alstad. M\u00e6hre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 28 The station was placed at M\u00e6hre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad. The most difficult work was through Grubb\u00e5sen, near \u00c5sen. The ground consisted of quick clay, which the railway was to pass through in a trench. On 5 May 1900, a landslide filled the trench, killing three navvies.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 30 Past the lake of Nesvannet, there was also weak soil mechanics, resulting in the need for piling. One worker was killed after getting hit by a piling log.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 31 In Levanger, there was debate as to whether the station should be on the west or east side of the tracks, with the decision falling on the west side.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 32 The section from Hell to Stj\u00f8rdal started revenue service on 1 February 1902. The section from Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen to Levanger was officially opened on 27 October 1902,Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 35 with ordinary services starting on 29 October.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 37 Hell Station\u2014the Mer\u00e5ker Line continues straight ahead while the Hell\u2013Sunnan Line diverts to the left Construction on the line's second part, from Levanger to Sunnan, started in 1901. Part of the reason for the early start was to help employ older navvies who were working on the southern section during the summer.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 45 By early 1904, the right-of-way to Fleskhus was completed and the laying of tracks could begin.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 46 The bridge over Verdalselva was built using of stone, which had to be transported from Baglo\u00e5sen in Levanger. The superstructure was built by Vulkan of Oslo and was installed between 9 September and 27 November 1903.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 47 In Verdals\u00f8ra there again arose a debate over which side of the tracks the station should be on. The townspeople wanted it on the west side, which was on the same side as the town center, while farmers wanted it east side, which was most accessible from the valley. The result was that the station was placed on the east side.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 50 The section from Levanger to Verdal was opened on 1 November 1904, although the station building was not completed until 1905. At the time there were two trains per direction per day, one passenger train and one post train.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 51 R\u00f8ra Station in the late 1940s For the bridge over Ydseelva in Verdal, which had a main span of only , construction started in April 1903 and was completed on 21 November. The area has quick clay, so the bridge needed piling.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 53 At R\u00f8ra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inder\u00f8y the right-of-way had to be moved because of poor soil mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a support being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men during the winter of 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK 90,179 and took 23.9 man-hours per meter to build.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 57 In the former municipality of Sparbu, there was a contentious debate over both the route and the location of the station. Although the line was built where it had originally been planned, two alternatives were launched, both which saw the line go further east and higher up in the terrain. At the time both the dairy and store were located at Lein. The current villages of Sparbu and M\u00e6re had not been established, and locals wanted the railway to go through Lein, which was the de facto municipal center. However, the alternatives were longer and would run through more rolling terrain, so the engineers insisted on the original route.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 58 The plans called for a station at Leira (today known as Sparbu) and at Vist, but many locals instead wanted it at M\u00e6re, in part to serve the new M\u00e6re Agricultural School.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 59 On 5 June 1900, Parliament voted in favor of only one station, at M\u00e6re. However, the decision was reverted by Parliament on 24 April 1901.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 60 A support wall was built at S\u00f8rlia, just south of Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the bridge over Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was performed in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kv\u00e6rner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 61 The bridge over Steinkjerelva took up a significant portion of the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 63 The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen\u2014and thus avoid the town itself\u2014was discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station should be on the south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 64 Construction of the bridge over Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK 45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 65 Steinkjer is surrounded by a moraine which had to be traversed with a cutting, long and up to deep. of earthwork was removed, half with a steam shovel, and largely used to build reclaimed land for the railway's right-of-way through Steinkjer.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 72 The official opening of the section between Verdal and Sunnan took place on 14 November 1905.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 77 Revenue service started the following day. M\u00e6re Station in the late 1940s ===Operation=== The choice of route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line naturally went through all the towns and most of the important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located at the foot of the lake of Sn\u00e5savatnet, allowing connection with steam ships.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 79 Scheduled services on Sn\u00e5savatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 303 Even before planning of the Hell\u2013Sunnan Line was completed, there arose disagreement as to the route onwards. In a plan from the 1870s, there was consensus that the towns of Stj\u00f8rdal, Levanger, Steinkjer and Namsos should receive a line, but there was a disagreement as to the route. The Beitstad Line would run from Steinkjer via Beitstad and Namdalseid to Namsos and from there to Grong, while the Sn\u00e5sa Line would run from Sunnan via Sn\u00e5sa to Grong, with a branch from Grong to Namsos.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 80 The Beitstad Line would run through the most densely populated areas, while the Sn\u00e5sa Line was shorter. Parliament decided on the Sn\u00e5sa Line in 1900.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 81 The railway was extended from Sunnan to Sn\u00e5sa Station on 30 October 1926, with the section from Hell to Sunnan becoming classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway was completed to Bod\u00f8 on 7 June 1962.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 82 Class 92 diesel multiple unit at HiNT Station, which has only a shed and serves Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College in Levanger In 1909, a station was opened at Fossemvatnet, followed by a station at Fleskhus in 1913. M\u00e6re continued to be the dominant center of Sparbu, so in 1915, the national authorities offered to build a station there. However, the municipality would not grant the necessary NOK 6,300, so the station was funded with private donations. Construction started in 1916 and M\u00e6re Station opened on 1 April 1917. In the original plans for the railway, a spur was planned from north of Steinkjerelva to Eggebogen in Egge. However, in the parliamentary voting for the line, the spur was removed.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 69 In 1915, a public report criticized the railway for not having sufficient access to a proper port in Steinkjer, as S\u00f8rsileiret was located on the river and did not have a deep quay. The municipal council voted in favor of a new quay at Eggebogen on 16 May 1916, which was completed in 1924.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 71 The spur to Bogakaia opened on 15 August 1927, having cost NOK 139,200.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 70 A station was opened at \u00d8stborg in 1923, at Alstad in 1934, and at Hammerberg, Eggen and Bergsgrav in 1938. In 1940, a spur was built to V\u00e6rnes Air Station and \u00d8yanmoen. A new, wooden station building was built at \u00c5sen in 1943 and 1944. The section to V\u00e6rnes was removed in 1947. Vudu Station opened in 1950, followed by Vollan in 1952 and Bj\u00f8rga and Sandferhus in the following year. From June to October 1953, a station was in use at Bj\u00f8rga. From 1957, NSB started replacing steam trains on the line by introducing Di 3 locomotives.N\u00e6ss (1999): 25 In 1956, NATO granted funding for an expansion of the runway at Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes. The easiest way was to extend the runway by building it over the road and railway and into the river. Construction started in 1959Hovd (2000): 176\u2013177 and on 1 June 1960, the V\u00e6rnes Tunnel was brought into use. A spur was built to Fiborgtangen in February 1966. Two years later, Elberg Station wax opened. Fossemvatnet Station was closed in 1972. The line received centralized traffic control in four phases: from Trondheim to Stj\u00f8rdal on 11 January 1976, to Levanger on 9 January 1977, to Steinkjer on 6 December 1977 and to Sn\u00e5sa on 23 November 1984. Bergsgrav Station was opened on 6 December 1977. In 1981, Di 4-locomotives were introduced.N\u00e6ss: 72 The spur to \u00d8yanmoen was taken out of use and removed in October 1982. NSB introduced Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1985, cutting travel time on local services between Steinkjer and Trondheim by 25 minutes. In 1989, the station building at Sunnan was demolished. In 1989 and 1990, five stations were closed, consisting on Sandferhus, Vold, Vollan, Vist and Sunnan. Class 93 train at Trondheim Airport Station On 1 September 1993, NSB launched the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail, of which the main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called for the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK 15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased with the opening of Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK 24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second V\u00e6rnes Tunnel being built.Hovd (2000): 315\u2013316 A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di 6 and Di 8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di 6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.N\u00e6ss: 100 In 2000, NSB started using Class 93 diesel multiple units on intercity trains, retiring the Di 3. In March 2000, NSB announced the closing of several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only two percent of the traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. M\u00e6re, \u00d8stborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT R\u00f8stad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements. ==Architecture== The preserved Levanger Station was built in a combination of Medieval, Gothic and Romanesque style. The stations were designed by Paul Due (1835\u20131919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870\u20131926).Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 89 Original stations between Stj\u00f8rdal and Levanger were designed by Paul Due, while those from Rinnan to Byafossen, as well as Hell Station, were designed by Paul Armin Due.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 83 The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and Art Nouveau, with early stations dominated more by the former and later stations more by the latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. R\u00f8ra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix\u2014as it was originally built at Hell in 1881.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 84 At the time of construction, the railways provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grand stations as a way to draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 88 As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from M\u00e6re and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot. The preserved Skogn Station is an example of the stations' style mix, with a random rubble ground story and wooden upper story, and with elements from both Dragestil and Art Nouveau Levanger Station is the most spectacular station on the line and also the best preserved town station. Built entirely in stone, it has a dominant position in town and with a park in front of the station. It was designed in combined Medieval style, with strong elements of Gothic and Romanesque style.Hartmann et al. (1997): 165 Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and Art Nouveau style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its characteristics were largely lost after it was connected with the bus station.Hartmann et al. (1997): 164 Three stations, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger, have been preserved, while Skatval and Hell have been protected.Ho\u00e5s and Stene (2006): 85 In 1993, NSB built new sheds on all stations served by the commuter rail. Linje Arkitekter designed sheds which combined the existing architectural traditions in material and roof shapes, with modern style. The sheds have a roof, glass walls and a framework in wood. They were optimized to give good protection from various types weather. ==Service== The main passenger service on the section from Hell to Steinkjer is the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail. Operated by the Norwegian State Railways, it runs at a fixed hourly headway\u2014with additional rush-hour services\u2014between Lerkendal Station in Trondheim and Steinkjer, calling at 13 stations on the Hell\u2013Sunnan Line. Travel time from Steinkjer is 24 minutes to Verdal, 37 minutes to Levanger, 1 hour and 24 minutes to Stj\u00f8rdal and 2 hours and 4 minutes to Trondheim. The services are operated with Class 92 diesel multiple units. NSB also operates intercity services from Trondheim to Bod\u00f8 on the Nordland Line. These consist of two daily through trains, one day and one night service, with an additional service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. Stj\u00f8rdal and Steinkjer are the only stations along the line which remain manned. NSB uses a combination of Class 93 diesel multiple units and Di 4-hauled trains. CargoNet and Cargolink operate freight trains along the line. CargoNet hauls using Vossloh Euro, while Cargolink uses Di 6 locomotives, respectively. ==Future== Politicians have signalized that they want to electrify the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer along with the Mer\u00e5ker Line. NSB will need to replace the Class 92 trains towards the end the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification. The county municipalities of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded reduce travel time to one hour. This would require the average speed to be increased to , mainly through a modernization of the existing line. Specific projects include electrification, double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport, additional passing loops, a new bridge over Stj\u00f8rdalselva and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell. This would have to be combined with a reduction in the number of stops. The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments, which would cost between NOK 4 and 6 billion, will allow a travel time of one hour and ten minutes. If a number of curves are straightened, increased capacity is introduced between Stj\u00f8rdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed, travel time could be reduced to one hour. Norsk Bane, a lobbyist organization which is suggesting to build a high-speed line from Oslo to Trondheim and onwards to Steinkjer, have proposed building an all-new right-of-way on the route. They estimate that regional trains would, with their infrastructure, be able to operate trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim in 40 minutes. The proposals involves only keeping the stations at Trondheim Airport, Stj\u00f8rdal, \u00c5sen, Levanger, Verdal, R\u00f8ra and Steinkjer along the Hell\u2013Sunnan segment. It would involve three services per hour and direct trains to Oslo, with speeds up to . ==References== ;Bibliography * * * * * * * ;Notes Category:Railway lines in Norway Category:Railway lines in Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Nordland Line Category:Railway lines opened in 1902 Category:1902 establishments in Norway Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Norway Category:National Romantic architecture in Norway Category:Art Nouveau railway stations ",
