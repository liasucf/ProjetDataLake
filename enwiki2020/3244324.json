    "text": "The leiqin (\u96f7\u7434 or \u64c2\u7434, literally \"thunderous instrument\"; also called leihu) is a Chinese bowed string musical instrument. ==Construction== It has a metal soundbox covered with snakeskin and a long fretless fingerboard. The two strings pass over a small bridge that is placed on the snakeskin, near the top edge. ==Playing technique== The leiqin is played while the player is seated in a chair, with the instrument's body resting in his or her lap and held in a vertical or near-vertical position. Unlike the erhu and other instruments in the huqin family, the strings are touched against the fingerboard in the same technique as the sanxian. ==History== The leiqin was adapted from an earlier traditional instrument called zhuihu in the 1920s. ==See also== *Zhuihu *Huqin *Music of China *Traditional Chinese musical instruments *String instruments ==External links== *Leihu page *Leiqin photo ===Audio=== *Leiqin MP3s (click on headphones to listen to individual tracks) ===Video=== *Leiqin video Category:Bowed string instruments Category:Chinese musical instruments Category:Drumhead lutes ",
