    "text": "Piberaline (EGYT-475; Trelibet) is a psychoactive drug and member of the piperazine chemical class which was developed in the 1980s. It has stimulant and antidepressant effects which are thought to be due largely to its active metabolite benzylpiperazine. It was researched to a limited extent in Hungary and Spain, but was not widely accepted and does not seem to be in current use, although a closely related drug befuraline with similar effects has been slightly more successful. ==See also== * Substituted piperazine * Befuraline * Fipexide ==References== Category:Piperazines Category:Carboxamides Category:Pyridines Category:Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents ",
