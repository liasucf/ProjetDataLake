Digi's multi-functional, enterprise class wireless cellular routers and WiMAX routers with optional Gobi support are designed for enterprise, retail, transportation, financial, remote office and network backup applications. The product family includes the following cellular routers: * Digi TransPort WR11 * Digi TransPort WR21 * Digi TransPort WR44 * Digi TransPort WR44R * Digi TransPort WR44RR ===Digi XBee and Long Range Radios=== Digi International manufactures a variety of RF (Radio Frequency) devices, both on the module level as well as long-range ethernet and serial modems. Digi XBee is the brand name for Digi International\u2019s form factor compatible radio modules. The modules consist of a variety of radios that support a number of wireless protocols and are certified for worldwide use. Digi XBee supports the following protocols: 802.15.4, DigiMesh, ZigBee, ZigBee Smart Energy, and Wi- Fi. In addition to the Digi XBee line of RF modules, Digi manufactures a variety of 900 MHz modems built for long range communications. In early 2015, the Digi XLR PRO was produced. This 900 MHz has a LOS range over 100 miles. The radio uses patent-pending Punch2 Technology to block out interference from near-by radios and achieve a high quality link over long distances. Long Range 900 MHz Radios * Dig XLR PRO * XTend * XPress Ethernet Bridge * XStream ===Embedded Products=== Digi offers module products based on Freescale\u2019s i.MX processors. This includes the Digi ConnectCore 6, which is an ultra-compact system-on-module device based on the Freescale i.MX6 processor family. Its low-profile, surface-mount design maximizes integration flexibility and significantly reduces design risk and is cost-effective. ===Embedded=== ====Chip==== * NS 9210 / 9215 \u2014 ARM9 core @ , MAC, AES encryption, PIC processors for interfacing * NS9750 * Rabbit 4000 \u2014 , MAC, AES encryption * Rabbit 5000 \u2014 , baseband MAC, MAC, AES encryption * Rabbit 6000 \u2014 , baseband MAC, MAC and PHY, USB 2.0 full-speed host, AES encryption ====Wireless==== An XBee radio. *XBee \u2014 family of small radios with compatible footprints ** Digi XBee ZB \u2014 Zigbee @ ** Digi XBee DM \u2014 Digimesh @ & ** Digi XBee 802.15.4 \u2014 802.15.4 & ====Embedded processor modules==== * Digi Connect Core Wi-MX51 \u2014 Module incorporating Freescale's i.MX51 processor * Digi Connect Core Wi-MX53 \u2014 Module incorporating Freescale's i.MX53 processor * Digi Connect Card Wi- MX28 \u2014 Module incorporating Freescale's i.MX28 processor * Digi Connect ME (Micro Embedded) * Digi Connect Wi-ME (Wireless Micro Embedded) * Digi Connect EM (Embedded Module) * Digi Connect Wi-EM (Wireless Embedded Module) ===Non Embedded=== Digi International offers a wide range of products including those designed for industrial (harsh environment) uses.
