It took place on the same day as other district council elections in the United Kingdom. The entire council was up for election as West Dorset returned to whole councils elections, after previously having been elected in thirds. The 1987 election saw the Independent councillors lose their majority they had held since the formation of the Council in 1974. ==Ward results== ===Beaminster=== ===Bothenhampton=== ===Bradford Abbas=== ===Bradpole=== ===Bridport North=== ===Bridport South=== ===Broadmayne=== ===Broadwindsor=== ===Burton Bradstock=== ===Caundle Vale=== ===Cerne Valley=== ===Charminster=== ===Charmouth=== ===Chesil Bank=== ===Chickerell=== ===Dorchester East=== ===Dorchester North=== ===Dorchester South=== ===Dorchester West=== ===Frome Valley=== ===Halstock=== ===Holnest=== ===Loders=== ===Lyme Regis=== ===Maiden Newton=== ===Netherbury=== ===Owermoigne=== ===Piddle Valley=== ===Puddletown=== ===Queen Thorne=== ===Sherborne East=== ===Sherborne West=== ===Symondsbury=== ===Thorncombe=== ===Tolpuddle=== ===Whitchurch Canonicorum=== ===Winterborne St Martin=== ===Yetminster=== ==References== West Dorset 1987 Category:20th century in Dorset ",
