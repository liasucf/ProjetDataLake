    "text": "All Through the House is a 2015 American holiday slasher film written and directed by Todd Nunes and produced by The Readmond Company. The film had its world premiere on 31 October 2015 at the RIP Film Festival (Hollywood, California), where it also won Best Slasher, Best Editing, and the Audience Choice Award. All Through the House stars Ashley Mary Nunes, Jessica Cameron, and Jennifer Wenger. The film was shot in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Lake Arrowhead, California over a period of 21 days in 2014. On October 4, 2016 the film was released on iTunes and other Video On Demand platforms by Gravitas Ventures. ==Plot== All Through the House revolves around the story of a Christmas-obsessed neighborhood that becomes engulfed in fear when five-year- old Jamie Garrett mysteriously vanishes from her home. Citing various different explanations ranging from Krampus to kidnapping, the adult denizens of the district begin to treat the young girl's mother and her home as the stuff of a spooky, holiday-themed legend. The missing girl\u2019s house goes dark as her mother becomes a depressed recluse. The local children, mesmerized by the seemingly-haunted story, trade bedtime fears about their missing friend, eventually turning the tragedy into an innocuous fairytale. Fifteen years later, Rachel Kimmel, a 22-year-old student, comes home for Christmas. The offbeat and slightly creepy Mrs. Garrett invites Rachel to her home as she finally emerges from her self-imposed exile, determined to make this Christmas a jovial one to be remembered, which brings Rachel\u2019s memories of the missing girl rushing back to her. All the while, the same neighborhood is being terrorized by a faceless killer dressed in a Santa suit and mask who stalks the wintery streets- slaughtering women and castrating men. Rachel and her two best friends soon find themselves trapped in a grisly nightmare, fighting for their lives as the Santa killer's obsession zeroes in on them as well as Mrs. Garrett and her festively-decorated home. After various terrifying encounters with the Santa killer that leave a trail of even more dead bodies behind, Rachel finally uncovers the madness behind the Santa mask and the truth behind the mysteries of the neighborhood's past. The killer\u2019s twisted revelation sends Rachel into shock as she learns her own sick connection to the Garrett family legacy. ==Cast== * Ashley Mary Nunes as Rachel Kimmell * Jessica Cameron as Sheila * Jennifer Wenger as Manny * Melynda Kiring as Mrs. Garrett * Lito Velasco as the Killer * Natalie Montera as Gia * Danica Riner as Sarah * Jason Schumacher as Cody * Johanna Rae as Beth * Cathy Garrett as Abby * Matt Poeschl as Blake * Kelsey Carlstedt as Crissy * Lyndon Laveaux as Adle * Tamra Garrett as Mrs. King * Justice Lee as Jacob * Sarah Miller as Young Jamie * Milijana Riner as Young Rachel * Noah Boylen as Joseph * John Nunes as Buddy * Sky Boylen as Rick * Ruff Nunes as Sugar Balls * Panthro as Damn Cat * Aeon as Licker ==Reception== Critical reviews for All Through the House have been positive.
