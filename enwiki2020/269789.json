    "text": "Portrait of Karl August Varnhagen von Ense by Samuel Friedrich Diez. Karl August Varnhagen von Ense (21 February 1785 in D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 10 October 1858 in Berlin) was a German biographer, diplomat and soldier. ==Life and career== He was born in D\u00fcsseldorf, the younger brother of Rosa Maria Varnhagen, a noted poet, writer, and educator. He studied medicine in Berlin, but most of his time was spent examining philosophy and literature, which he later studied more thoroughly at Halle and T\u00fcbingen. He began his literary career in 1804 working along with Adelbert von Chamisso on his Berliner Musenalmanach. In 1809, he joined the main Austrian army under Archduke Charles, serving in IR47 Vogelsang at the Battle of Wagram, where he was wounded on the first day, 5th July. Von Ense \u2018\u2019Die Schlacht Von Deutsch-Wagram am 5. und 6. July 1809\u2019\u2019 (Vienna) (1909) He was then made adjutant to Prince Bentheim, whom he accompanied to Paris, where he continued his studies. In 1812, he entered the Prussian civil service in Berlin but soon left to enter the Russian service as captain. He served in Tettenborn's corps as adjutant to Tettenborn on trips to Hamburg and Paris. He recorded his experiences in Geschichte der Hamburger Ereignisse (History of the events in Hamburg; London, 1813) and Geschichte der Kriegsz\u00fcge Tettenborns (History of Tettenborn's Campaigns, 1814). He worked as a tutor and butler in the homes of several families of the wealthy Jewish bourgeoisie. This allowed him to learn from an early age young characters in his time, some already famous, such as: Adelbert von Chamisso, Justinus Kerner, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9, Ludwig Uhland and many other poets of romanticism. He accompanied Prince Hardenberg to the Congress of Vienna in 1814, and between 1815 and 1819 he served as Prussian Minister-Resident at Carlsruhe. After 1819, he resided chiefly in Berlin, bearing the title \u201cGeheimer Legationsrat.\u201d He had no fixed official appointment but was often employed in important political business. He carried on an extensive correspondence with Alexander von Humboldt, and two volumes of Humboldt's letters to him have been published.Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense.

He possessed a remarkable ability to group facts together and to bring out their essential significance. His style is distinguished for its strength, grace and purity. Among his principal works are: *Goethe in den Zeugnissen der Mitlebenden (1824) *Biographische Denkm\u00e4ler (5 vols., 1824\u201330; 3rd ed., 1872) *Biographies of General von Seydlitz (1834), Field-Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, victor over Napoleon at Waterloo, Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Prussia (1837), Field-Marshal Schwerin (1841), Field-Marshal Keith (1844), and General B\u00fclow von Dennewitz (1853) His Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften appeared in nine volumes in 1843-59, the last two volumes appearing after his death. His niece, Ludmilla Assing, between 1860 and 1867, edited several volumes of his correspondence with eminent men and his Tageb\u00fccher (14 vols., 1861\u201370). Bl\u00e4tter aus der preussischen Geschichte appeared in five volumes (1868\u201369); his correspondence with his wife, Rahel, appeared in six volumes in 1874\u201375; and that with Carlyle in 1892. His selected writings appeared in 19 volumes in 1871-76. ==Family== In 1814, he married saloniste Rahel Levin after she converted from Judaism to Christianity. Varnhagen was devotedly attached to her and found in her sympathy and encouragement. She was one of the chief sources of his inspiration as a writer. He never fully recovered from the shock of her death in 1833, but he published memorial volumes containing selections from her papers: Rahel, ein Buch des Andenkens f\u00fcr ihre Freunde (Rahel, a memorial book for her friends, 3 vols., 1834) and Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahels Umgang (A gallery of portraits from Rahel's circle, 2 vols., 1836). ==Notes== ==References== * * ;Attribution Category:German biographers Category:Male biographers Category:Prussian diplomats Category:Austrian Empire military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:German untitled nobility Category:Military personnel from D\u00fcsseldorf Category:1785 births Category:1858 deaths Category:University of T\u00fcbingen alumni Category:University of Halle alumni Karl August Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:Burials at Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I, Berlin Category:Writers from D\u00fcsseldorf ",
