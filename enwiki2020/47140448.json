It appeared as the B-side to his 1948 single \"A Mansion on the Hill\". ==Background== It was recorded on November 6, 1947 at Castle Studio in Nashville. Williams was supported by a group that producer Fred Rose assembled from two Grand Ole Opry bands: Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Ennis (rhythm guitar) were from Red Foley's band while Chubby Wise (fiddle) was a member of Bill Monroe's band. The song is an up- tempo number in which the narrator describes his infatuation with an unfaithful woman. Bob Dylan recorded the song for the 2001 album Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute. In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One Dylan wrote, \"The sound of his voice went through me like an electric rod and I managed to get a hold of a few of his 78s - \"Baby, We're Really in Love\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" and \"Lost Highway\" - and I played them endlessly...You can learn a lot about the structure of songwriting by listening to his records, and I listened to them a lot and had them internalized.\" The The also recorded it for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky. ==References== Category:1947 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs Category:Song recordings produced by Fred Rose (songwriter) Category:MGM Records singles ",
