    "text": "The Entebbe\u2013Kampala Expressway, also known as the \"Kampala\u2013Entebbe Expressway\" or the \"Entebbe\u2013Kampala Highway\", is a four-lane toll highway in the Central Region of Uganda. The highway links Entebbe International Airport, the country's largest civilian and military airport, to Kampala, the country's capital and largest metropolitan area. Commissioning was originally planned for 2016 but because of the delayed works, commissioning was done on 15 June 2018 by Uganda's sitting president, Yoweri Museveni. ==Location== The highway starts at Entebbe International Airport and continues to Mpala, goes through Akright City, Kajjansi, and Kabojja, and ends at Busega, where it joins the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway, a distance of approximately . A spur branches off the highway at Kajjansi to connect to Munyonyo, a suburb of Kampala, located on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, a distance of about . The entire highway is a four-lane, dual carriage expressway, with limited access. The coordinates of the expressway at Abayita Ababiri are 0\u00b005'25.0\"N, 32\u00b029'35.0\"E (Latitude:0.090278; Longitude:32.493056). ==Overview== The Kampala Entebbe Expressway was constructed with the overall strategy of decongesting the Greater Kampala Metropolitan area. It is the first toll road in Uganda and it provides an alternative to the free existing surface road, known as the Kampala\u2013Entebbe Road, or simply Entebbe Road which is narrow, congested, and not sufficient to handle the heavy traffic traversing it. The expressway is gated and in the future vehicles that access it will be pay a toll charge. ==History== In 2009, the Government of Uganda (GOU) began consultations with the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the construction of a four-lane (dual-carriage) highway connecting Entebbe and Kampala. In November 2010, the two governments signed an agreement where the Chinese government, through the Exim Bank of China, would lend up to US$350 million for the construction of the highway, repayable over forty years. The contract was awarded to China Communication Construction Company, which also constructed the Soroti-Lira Road. Construction began in 2012. ==Construction costs== In 2012, the expressway was estimated to cost US$476 million (UGX:1.19 trillion). Of this, US$350 million (UGX:875 billion) is a loan from the Exim Bank of China at 2 percent annual interest. The remaining US$126 million (UGX:315 billion) was provided by the GOU. GOU has already, or will provide in the future, another UGX:123 billion to compensate land owners along the expressway route. ==Developments== On 21 November 2012, the president of Uganda commissioned the beginning of construction of the highway at a ceremony at Kyengera, along the Kampala-Masaka road. The EastAfrican reported in August 2017 that completion was scheduled for May 2018. The Daily Monitor made a similar report in November 2017. The completed road was commissioned on Friday 15 June 2018. The completed road will have to wait for the installation of toll-paying technology at the payment booths and the passage of the law authoring the building and use of toll roads. A new completion date has been put at 16 November 2018. However, the expressway is open to the public, effective 15 June 2018. It is expected that collection of toll fees on this highway will begin in January 2020. ==Points of interest== The following points of interest lie close or near the Entebbe\u2013Kampala Expressway: (1) the town of Entebbe in Wakiso District (2) the settlement of Abayita Ababiri in Wakiso District (3) the community of Akright City in Wakiso District (4) settlement of Kabojja in Wakiso District (5) neighborhood of Busega in Lubaga Division in the city of Kampala, where the highway will join the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway (6) neighborhood of Kajjansi in Wakiso District, where an arm of the highway will branch off to Munyonyo, on the northern shores of Lake Victoria (7) the suburb of Munyonyo in Makindye Division, in Kampala, where an arm of the highway will end. ==See also== * Kampala District * Ssabagabo * Wakiso District * List of roads in Uganda ==Photos and diagrams== *Aerial Photo of Kajjansi Interchange New Vision on 28 February 2017. *The Map of Kampala-Entebbe Express Highway ==References== ==External links== * Computer Simulation of Highway Design And Traffic Patterns * Google Map of proposed route by Suda-africa.org Category:Roads in Uganda Category:Wakiso District Category:Kampala District Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in Uganda ",
