    "text": "Konstantinos Paspatis () (5 June 1878 - 1 July 1903) was a Greek tennis player. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. He was born in Liverpool, England and died in Athens. Paspatis won a bronze medal in the singles tournament. In the first round, he defeated George S. Robertson of Great Britain and Ireland. His second round opponent was fellow Greek Aristidis Akratopoulos, whom Paspatis defeated as well. He met eventual gold medallist John Pius Boland in the semifinals, however, and was defeated. Since there was no playoff for third place, Paspatis and Momcsill\u00f3 Tapavicza of Hungary are considered to share third. In the doubles tournament, Paspatis and partner Evangelos Rallis (also of Greece) were defeated in the first round by Dionysios Kasdaglis and Demetrios Petrokokkinos, also Greeks (the former from Egypt). This put the pair in two-way tie for fourth place of the five pairs. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1903 deaths Category:19th-century English people Category:19th-century Greek people Category:19th-century male tennis players Category:British people of Greek descent Category:English people of Greek descent Category:Greek male tennis players Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Greece Category:Olympic tennis players of Greece Category:Sportspeople from Liverpool Category:Tennis players at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics ",
