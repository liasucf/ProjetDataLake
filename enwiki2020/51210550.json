In the beginning of the 1920s, gifted with a rare skill in polemics, he was with Nguy\u1ec5n Phan Long, one of the best representatives of the progressive native press in French Indochina. Throughout those years, willing to distance himself from those who advocated a direct confrontation against the colonial regime, his attitude evolved toward a more prudent moderation. == Biography == Maurice Henri Eug\u00e8ne Dejean de la B\u00e2tie was born in Hanoi in 1898. Son of a French diplomat, Marie Joseph Maurice Dejean de la B\u00e2tie, and a Vietnamese woman, Dang thi Khai, he obtained the acknowledgment of paternity from his father in 1920. He passed his high school degree at the school of Puginier of Hanoi, then went on studying and graduated from the School of Public Works of the University of Hanoi. For a few months, he worked as a land surveyor. Very soon after his military service, he switched fields to become a publicist, a term commonly used at that time. == Beginnings of a career of journalist == Eugene Dejean de la B\u00e2tie began his career in journalism at the beginning of the twenties in Saigon, Cochinchina. In 1923, he was Editor in Chief of La Voix annamite (The Annamite Voice); it was under this title that he joined the Cochinchinese Press Syndicate which was then presided over by Henry de Chavigny de Lachevroti\u00e8re. In 1924, he was found again at L'\u00c9cho annamite (The Annamite Echo) managed by Nguyen Phan Long. In April 1925, he wrote an article : \u00abWhy we don\u2019t wish for the Annamite people their immediate liberation from the French guardianship\u00bb. In this article, Dejean took up a somewhat ambiguous attitude: he rejected the argument of those who justified the French presence by the fact that Vietnam was unable to attain its independence even when it envied its neighbors (China and Japan); but at the same time he thought that the Annamite people needed France to implement its modernization. == Collaboration with Paul Monin and Andr\u00e9 Malraux == In June 1925, he became a collaborator of the daily newspaper L'Indochine (The Indochina) created by Paul Monin and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. In issue 6 of L'Indochine (dated June 23. 1925) he explained why he left L'\u00c9cho annamite. Clara Malraux related in her Memories that, foreseeing that people could blame him for abandoning the Annamites to the Europeans, without delay he had specified his viewpoint: \u00abfor the majority of Annamites, the only name of Monin is a guarantee of the pro\u2013annamite tendencies of The Indochina newspaper \u2026 Being neither meat nor fish, I have the noticeable advantage to be of the two at the same time! But my natural inclination rather incites me to lean toward the weak\u2026\u00bb Eug\u00e8ne Dejean de la B\u00e2tie participated actively in the struggle led by Monin and Malraux for the grant of democratic rights to natives: freedom of movement, of meeting, of expression, with authorization of a free press in Vietnamese. The friendship of Dejean and of Malraux is illustrated by the following anecdote, which stemmed from a disagreement of the team at L'Indochine with Le Quang Trinh, the director of Le progr\u00e8s annamite (The Annamite Progress), a newspaper supported by the colonial administration. Le progr\u00e8s annamite relates in its own way the unexpected visit to Mr. Le Quang Trinh by Mr. Malraux accompanied by Mr Dejean de la B\u00e2tie following the article containing offensive insinuations toward the ruling class of Indochina: \u00abVery pleasantly, Le Quang Trinh held out his hand to Mr. Malraux. The latter, while introducing himself, took care not to shake it. With a pale face and tight lips, Mr. Malraux threatened the worst retaliations if I began to talk again in my newspaper of any bas-relief. According to Le Quang Trinh who calmly but sharply replied to Mr. Malraux, the effect of his speech have been crushing: \u201cthe hot tempered gentleman had disappeared followed by his faithful squire [Dejean]\u201d. And Nguyen Phan Long, author of the article goes on saying facetiously: \u00abWe didn\u2019t know that Mr Le Quang Trinh had such a chastised eloquence and with such a crushing efficacity\u00bb. Nevertheless, noting the disagreement which appeared between Monin and Malraux, Dejean de la B\u00e2tie left L'Indochine. Together with his friend Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh, they began to republish La Cloche f\u00eal\u00e9e (The Cracked Bell), which had ceased to exist in June 1924. The two men then offered its management to Phan Van Truong, a lawyer of French citizenship, who had been a companion of the future H\u00f4 Chi Minh in Paris in the early twenties. During that time Dejean de la B\u00e2tie approved and supported the nationalist aspirations of his Vietnamese compatriots. == Distancing from the Vietnamese nationalists and communists == For many months, Dejean supplied written materials to La Cloche f\u00eal\u00e9e without however giving up writing for L'\u00c9cho annamite. After the arrest of Nguyen An Ninh in April 1926 (accused of anti French activities), La Cloche f\u00eal\u00e9e was closed. Eug\u00e8ne Dejean de la B\u00e2tie created a new newspaper with Phan Van Truong, L'Annam, which tone would be even more offensive to the colonial administration than that of La Cloche f\u00eal\u00e9e. But then Dejean had a disagreement with Phan Van Truong over one of their collaborators, Nguyen Pho, whom Truong thought to be an informant of the Security. Dejean was convinced that Nguyen Pho was not a traitor, but was unable to make Truong share his belief. Becoming the director of L'\u00c9cho annamite, Dejean de la B\u00e2tie developed essays which led him to clearly condemn the communist positions. A few months before the closing of the publication of the daily paper, in 1931, he was injured in a road accident. A rumor spread out in Saigon that he was the victim of a communist attempt. Eug\u00e8ne replied with his usual humor: \u201c I would have been a victim of a blow from an axe. Why not one from a sickle or a hammer?\u201d In the 1930s, Dejean de la B\u00e2tie, joined the socialists of Indochina and contributed to their daily newspaper, Le Populaire (The Popular). A few years later, he was found again in the newspaper L'Alerte (Alert), under the direction of a Mr. Fauquenot who turned out to be a spy in the service of the Japanese. Dejean de la B\u00e2tie was not compromised in this affair, but L'Alerte could not survive this torment. In 1938, Dejean de la B\u00e2tie contributed to the rebirth of The Annamite Echo which stopped being published in April 1931. However, in the early 1940s, he was forced to accept that the content of his newspaper L'\u00c9cho annamite, be submitted to censorship by the petainist regime of Admiral Decoux, for which he would be blamed at the end of the war. Eug\u00e8ne Dejean de la B\u00e2tie died of illness, in Saigon on December 31. 1946, at the age of forty eight. == Bibliography== Clara Malraux, Le Bruit des nos pas, Les Combats et les jeux, Grasset, 1969, .
