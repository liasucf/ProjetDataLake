    "text": "All Summers End is a 2017 American drama film directed and written by Kyle Wilamowski. The film stars Tye Sheridan, Kaitlyn Dever, Austin Abrams, Beau Mirchoff, Paula Malcomson and Annabeth Gish. == Plot == Conrad (Sheridan), Hunter (Abrams) and Tim (Lee) are close friends living in a small town. Grace (Dever) takes a liking to Conrad and they start spending a lot of time with each other, which stresses Conrad's relationship with Hunter and Tim. Having promised Hunter and Tim that they could hang out on The 4th of July, Conrad declines an invitation to watch the fireworks with Grace's family. The three boys drive around the town stealing garden ornaments and Conrad \u2013 on a dare \u2013 goes to steal a plant from the porch of Grace's house. Unbeknownst to them, Grace had earlier had a fight with her brother Eric, who has consequently stayed home while Grace and her parents went to see the fireworks. The boys are nearly caught and Eric gets in his car, chasing them to the outskirts of the town. The boys narrowly avoid a deer that wanders onto the road, but Eric hits the deer and crashes into a tree. The boys argue about whether to call for help, as he is still breathing, but leave the scene hoping that someone would pass along soon. The next day, word spreads through the town that Eric succumbed to his injuries and has died. Grace is ridden with guilt due to her fight with Eric and finds comfort in Conrad, who has fallen out with Tim and Hunter due to their refusal to help Eric at the scene of the accident. Conrad tries to tell Grace the truth but is interrupted by her parents. As Grace finds comfort in Conrad, the two become close. On the night that Grace's parents go away to Eric's college to pack up his dorm room, she loses her virginity to Conrad. Grace leaves to go to church the next morning, telling Conrad that he would have the house to himself, but her parents return early. Grace's parents discover the discarded condom wrapper and, feeling betrayed, tell Conrad to leave. Grace has a fight with her parents and goes to look for Conrad, finding him in an abandoned house he had shown her earlier. Conrad, now in distress, confesses the truth to Grace and she leaves, telling him that she never wants to see him again. Conrad goes home and tells his mother what had happened. Following this talk, he goes to see Grace's parents to tell them the truth and return the plant. It is revealed that Conrad never did get back in touch with Grace and hopes she\u2019s okay wherever she is. An adult Conrad eventually marries and has a son, whom he names Eric. == Cast == * Tye Sheridan as Conrad Stevens, Grace's love interest ** Pablo Schreiber as Older Conrad Stevens * Kaitlyn Dever as Grace Turner, Conrad's love interest * Austin Abrams as Hunter Gorski, Conrad's friend * Ryan Lee as Timmy, Conrad's other friend * Paula Malcomson as Mrs. Stevens, Conrad's mother * Annabeth Gish as Mrs. Turner, Grace's mother * Bill Sage as Mr. Turner, Grace's father * Beau Mirchoff as Eric Turner.
