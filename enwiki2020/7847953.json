He placed fifth in a crowded field of 7 candidates, which included future judge Ernesto Scorsone (who won the nomination), future Mayor and Newberry's 2006 Mayoral Election opponent Teresa Isaac, and future Kentucky State Treasurer, Democratic Party Chair, and Gubernatorial candidate Jonathan Miller.\"7-Way Primary Divides Ky. Democrats\", Thomas B. Edsall, The Washington Post, Page A04, May 26, 1998 ===Mayoral election of 2006=== Jim Newberry successfully ran for Mayor of Lexington- Fayette County in 2006. Newberry ran a change-based campaign, profiting from a contentious political environment that was dissatisfied with the direction of the city. The paramount issue that year was the question of whether or not the city should condemn and take over the local water company, Kentucky American Water, which was to be decided by popular referendum. Newberry did not take a position in this issue, promising to support the decision of the voters. His opponent, Teresa Isaac, openly supported condemnation. On Election Day in 2006, Lexington voters voted not to condemn the water company, defeating the referendum with 61% of the vote.\"Rebuke of Teresa Isaac & Lexington Herald Leader\", Aaron Yelowitz, Blog: Lexington Mayor's Race 2006, http://lexingtonmayorsrace.blogspot.com/2006/11/rebuke-of-teresa-isaac- lexington.html Newberry also defeated Isaac, garnering 62.6% of the vote. This was the first time a challenger had unseated a sitting Mayor seeking reelection in the history of Merged Government in Lexington-Fayette County. It was also the largest margin of victory in Lexington's history. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Candidate ! Votes !

As Mayor, he focused on a wide range of initiatives, including projects meant to stimulate the economy, balance the budget, make government more efficient, and protect the environment. In the area of job-creation, Newberry partnered the city with Commerce Lexington, the University of Kentucky, and Bluegrass Community and Technical College to form the Bluegrass Business Development Partnership, which has thus-far led to the creation of over 2,300 jobs. He also pursued efforts to make government more transparent and accountable, implementing board training for board-appointees, expanding the Internal Audit Division, and expanding and redesigning the city's website to include access to public meetings, as well as a large number of government documents. He attempted to make government more efficient by reducing the size of the city's work force by 200 full-time positions. He has also pursued efforts to cut taxes, slicing the Garbage Tax by 10% and reducing the number of business owners liable for the mandatory license fee. Additionally, when Newberry first took office, he had an auditing firm hired to assess the efficiency of Urban County Government operations. The audit identified over 400 ways in which Lexington's government could save taxpayer money, and Newberry's administration worked to utilize this advice. Newberry also pursued many initiatives to make Lexington environmentally more friendly. When he first took office, his administration created the city's first executive department dedicated solely to environmental issues, the Department of Environmental Quality.Website: Department of Environmental Quality, Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=2323 At the time Newberry took office, the city had been sued by the Environmental Protection Agency for allowing its storm and sanitary sewers to pollute local water sources for decades. Newberry reached a settlement with the EPA, and set about updating the city's aging infrastructure.Fact page, \"EPA consent decree\", Website: Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=840 His administration also endeavored to make Lexington more bicycle-friendly, installing more bike lanes and trails than ever before. This effort was nationally recognized by Bicycling Magazine in 2010, which named Lexington one of \"America's Top 50 Bike-Friendly Cities.\" \"America's Top 50 Bike-Friendly Cities\", Bicycling Online, 2010, http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-3-583-21901-1,00.html Additionally, Newberry pushed the city to increase recycling. During his term, revenue from recycling more than doubled,Tom Eblen, \"Recycling turns trash into treasure. Recycling reduces waste, boosts Lexington's bottom line\", Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 21, 2010, http://www.kentucky.com/2010/04/21/1231818/turning-trash-into-treasure.html and in 2010, Newberry announced the city's investment in a new, single-stream recycling system that would encourage Lexingtonians to recycle more waste, and triple the capacity of the city's recycling center.Mayor Newberry announces more efficient, simplified recycling program for Lexington\", City News, Website: Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, April 22, 2010, http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=24&recordid;=1363&returnURL;=%2findex.aspx%3fpage%3d1 ===Controversies=== In March 2008, private developer The Webb Companies announced plans to build a high-rise mixed-used skyscraper (see: CentrePointe, Lexington), on the block occupied by several businesses. These included The Dame, a popular music venue with young Lexingtonians and students, and Mia's, a gay and lesbian bar. Newberry supported the demolition of the block and the building of the project from the beginning, causing many in the progressive and arts communities to associate him with the project and its subsequent difficulties. Newberry supported the project because it was purported to create over 900 jobs and infuse $250,000,000 into the Lexington community through Tax Increment Financing. After almost a decade from the previous buildings being demolished in the Summer of 2008, construction began on new buildings in November of 2017. 2008 and 2009 saw a series of highly publicized investigations into inappropriate spending at agencies receiving taxpayer funding. At the end of 2008, the Lexington Herald Leader reported on profligate spending and abnormally large expense account by Blue Grass Airport Director Michael Gobb, expenses which had been approved by the Airport's Board of Directors.Jennifer Hewlett, \"The story that sparked the investigation: A sky-high expense account\", Lexington Herald Leader, November 23, 2008, http://www.kentucky.com/2008/11/23/602751/the-story-that-sparked-the- investigation.html\"Special Report: Blue Grass Airport's Runaway Spending\", Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com/runaway_spending/index.html The story sparked an investigation by Kentucky Auditor Crit Luallen, the result of which led to criminal charges against airport employees. Charges sparking the investigation included $4,500 spent at a Texas strip club, charged to a company credit card.Jennifer Hewlett and Ryan Alessi, \"Auditors 'appalled' by spending\", Lexington Herald-Leader, January 7, 2009, http://www.kentucky.com/2009/01/07/648540/auditors-appalled-by-spending.html As Mayor, Newberry was responsible for appointing members of the Airport Board, and was criticized by Vice Mayor Jim Gray and some Council Members for an alleged lack of action in response to the scandal, as well as his continued support of Airport Board officials and confidence in their ability to clean up the worrisome practices there.Michelle Ku, \"Mayor, vice mayor differ on scandal\", Lexington Herald-Leader, January 11, 2009, http://www.kentucky.com/2009/01/11/654099_mayor-vice-mayor-differ-on- scandal.html As a result of heightened scrutiny of city agencies following the scandal surrounding the Airport, city auditors investigated spending at the taxpayer-funded Public Library. Library CEO Kathleen Imhoff and other Library employees came under scrutiny for excessive and inappropriate spending on Library credit cards, charges which included tens of thousands of dollars in gifts to staff, over $80,000 in travel expenses, and over $10,000 in non- reimbursed meals.John Cheves, \"Library finances: Checking out the books\", Lexington Herald-Leader, April 26, 2009, http://www.kentucky.com/2009/04/26/774507/library-finances-checking- out.html\"Special Report: Library Expenses\", Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com/library/index.html Following these scandals, similar spending issues were uncovered at two outside agencies in which Lexington- Fayette County is a member. At both the Kentucky League of Cities and the Kentucky Association of Counties, spending came under scrutiny from the media as well as formal auditors.\"Special Report: Kentucky Association of Counties\", Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com/kaco/\"Special Report: Kentucky League of Cities\", Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com/klc/ ==Reelection campaign: 2010== In November 2009, Newberry officially announced the start of his reelection campaign.
