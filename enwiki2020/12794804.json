Morgue assistant and anthropology expert Lori (Alexandra Delli Colli) discovers he was from the Asian Molucca islands where she grew up. Dr. Peter Chandler (Ian McCulloch) investigates, and he and Lori discover that similar corpse mutilations have occurred in other city hospitals, where immigrants from this region are working. Peter leads an expedition to the islands to investigate, where he liaises with Doctor Obrero (Donald O'Brien). Included are his assistant George, George's eager journalist girlfriend Susan, Lori, local boatsman Molotto assigned by Obrero, and three guides. The crew are hunted by cannibals and zombies, the latter created by the sinister Doctor Obrero who is experimenting with corpses. Lori is accepted as queen of the cannibals, and sends them off against the mad scientist and his zombie army. ==Cast== * Ian McCulloch as Dr. Peter Chandler * Alexandra Delli Colli as Lori Ridgeway * Sherry Buchanan as Susan Kelly * Peter O'Neal as George Harper * Donald O'Brien as Dr. Obrero/Dr. Butcher (US version) * Dakar as Molotto * Walter Patriarca as Dr. Dreylock ==Release== The film was released in Italy in 1980 and grossed a total of 300 million Italian lira.
