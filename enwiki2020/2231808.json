    "text": "The Spl\u00fcgen Pass (; ; ) is an Alpine mountain pass of the Lepontine Alps. It connects the Swiss, Grisonian Spl\u00fcgen to the north below the pass with the Italian Chiavenna to the south at the end of the Valle San Giacomo below the pass. ==Geography== The pass road connects the Swiss Hinterrhein valley and Spl\u00fcgen in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden with the Valle San Giacomo and Chiavenna in the Italian province of Sondrio, the road continuing to Lake Como. The pass is the water divide between the drainage basins of the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea, and the Po, which flows into the Adriatic. The pass is overlooked by Pizzo Tambo and the Surettahorn, on its western and eastern side respectively. On the Italian side of the pass is Montespluga, a small three street village which is cut off from both Italy and Switzerland during the winter. Historic Via Spluga Since the opening of the San Bernardino road tunnel in 1967, the pass has lost its former importance; it is not kept open in winter. Thanks to its lack of importance it is now a quiet pass where essential portions of the historical roads have survived allowing a good historical review for hikers on the Via Spluga. == History == The pass was already in use in the Roman era. It possibly corresponds to Cunus Aureus shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana (which may alternatively have referred to the Julier Pass). The name Spl\u00fcgen itself is possibly derived from specula (\"lookout\"). In the Middle Ages, the Bishops of Chur had the trade route relocated to Septimer Pass. From 1818 to 1823 the modern road was built at the behest of the Austrian authorities, then ruling the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia in the south. In 1840, author Mary Shelley traveled through the pass on the way to Lake Como with her son. She describes the pass in her travel narrative, Rambles in Germany and Italy, published in 1844: Historic depiction of crossing Spl\u00fcgen Pass in winter In 1843 the road was further expanded with a long avalanche gallery designed by the Swiss engineer Richard La Nicca which today is out of use but largely preserved. Plans to build a railroad line across Spl\u00fcgen Pass were abandoned in favour of the Gotthard railway opened in 1882. The Pass is also mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", a Sherlock Holmes short story of 1924. The Austrian Baron Adalbert Gr\u00fcner, the villain of the story, murdered his wife by throwing her from the Pass, although Holmes cannot prove it. ==See also== * List of highest paved roads in Europe * List of mountain passes *List of the highest Swiss passes ==Bibliography== * Nicola Pfund, Sui passi in bicicletta - Swiss Alpine passes by bicycle, Fontana Edizioni, 2012, p. 140-145. ==References== ==External links== *History *Gradient of the road from Spl\u00fcgen *Gradient of the road from Chiavenna Category:Mountain passes of the Alps Category:Mountain passes of Italy Category:Mountain passes of Switzerland Category:Italy\u2013Switzerland border crossings Category:Valle Spluga Category:Landforms of Lombardy Category:Mountain passes of Graub\u00fcnden Category:Transport in Lombardy Category:Lepontine Alps ",
