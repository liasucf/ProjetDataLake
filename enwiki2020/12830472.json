    "text": "The Texas Military Forces (TXMF) are the principal instrument through which the Texas Military Department (TMD) executes security policy for Texas, which has the second largest population and border in the United States, and the tenth largest economy in the world. The Texas Military Forces have a budget of $101.1 million as of 2017. Current forces include the Texas Army National Guard, Texas Air National Guard, and Texas State Guard of the Texas Militia. Former forces include the Texian Militia, Texian Army, Texian Navy, Texas Army, Texas Navy, and Texas Marines. It also included the Texas Rangers from their inception until 1935. The Texas Military Forces are administered by the Texas Military Department under command of the Adjutant General of Texas, who is appointed by and subordinate to the Governor of Texas, the Commander in Chief. == History == Texas Military Forces are inextricably linked and have served an integral role in the development, history, culture, and international reputation of Texas. They were established with the Texian Militia in 1823 (thirteen years before the Republic of Texas and twenty-two years before the State of Texas) by Stephen Austin to defend the Old Three Hundred in the Colony of Texas. Texas Military Forces sparked the Texas Revolution at the Battle of Velasco and became legendary at the Battle of Gonzales (the \"Lexington of Texas\"). Their legend continued at their defeat by Mexican forces at Siege of the Alamo, with events such as the Immortal 32 and To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World, which resulted in one of the most notable last stands in history. As of 2018, the Alamo Mission is the most visited tourist attraction in Texas and one of ten manmade UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States. The Texas Military's legend was sealed at the Battle of San Jacinto when they defeated Santa Anna's army in eighteen minutes, achieving independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico and establishing the Republic of Texas; one of three colonies to win independence without foreign aid in world history and the only American state (the Thirteen Colonies were aided by France, and the California Republic and Republic of Hawaii were aided by the United States). The artillery used during the battle, the Twin Sisters, are considered the \"Holy Grail of Texas\". During the 19th Century, the Texas Rangers service in the Texas-Indians Wars and fighting outlaws significantly contributed to the folklore of the \"Wild West\". During the American Civil War, Texas Military Forces served under the command of Union and Confederate militaries. When the first units reached Virginia, Jefferson Davis greeted them by declaring: \"Texans! The troops of other states have their reputations to gain, but the sons of the defenders of the Alamo have theirs to maintain.\" The Texas Brigade achieved distinction as Confederate shock troops, while the Davis Guards maintained Texas as the only Confederate State unconquered by the Union with their victory at Second Battle of Sabine Pass. It is referred to as the \"Thermopylae of the Confederacy\" and the most one-sided Confederate victory of the war. Texas Military Forces also achieved distinction fighting and winning the last engagement of the war at the Battle of Palemito Ranch. Texas Military Forces have not waged a domestic combat operation since the 19th century. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, they have been primarily engaged in military operations other than war, including manmade and natural disaster operations, search and rescue operations, counterdrug operations, and border security operations. Most notably, the Mexican Drug War, Texas City Disaster, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Bastrop County Complex Fire, Operation Jump Start, Operation Phalanx, and Operation Faithful Patriot. Under command of the United States Department of Defense, Texas Military Forces have served in the Mexican War, Spanish War, Philippine War, Mexican Expedition, World War I, World War II, Cold War (Korea and Vietnam campaigns), and War on Terror. Since the September 11 attacks, Texas Military units have been deployed for the War on Terror more than any other state. == Administration == Texas Military Forces are administered by the Texas Military Department under command of the Adjutant General of Texas, who is appointed by and subordinate to the Governor of Texas, the Commander in Chief. == Authority == Texas Military Forces exist under civilian control. Since 1903, Texas Military Forces are authorized by Title 32 of the United States Code and Article 4 of the Texas Constitution to \"execute the laws of the State, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions.\" Texas Army National Guard and Texas Air National Guard units are also subject to Title 10 of the United States Code, which legally empowers the United States government to mobilize them when more resources are needed than available in the United States Armed Forces for war, national emergency, or national security. Under Title 10, operations are conducted under command of the United States Department of Defense by the Secretary of Defense. == Award and decorations == Awards and decorations of the Texas Military are the medals, ribbons, badges, tabs, trophies, plaques, certificates, memorials, and monuments that recognize service and achievement while serving in the Texas Military Forces. == Conflicts == The history of conflicts involving the Texas Military Forces spans nearly two centuries, from 1823 to the present, under the command authority (the ultimate source of lawful military orders) of four governments including the Texan government (in 3 incarnations), the U.S. government, the Mexican government, and the Confederate regime. == Units == Texas Military Forces have undergone many re-designations, reorganizations, and reformations since 1823.
