    "text": "The Euratom Treaty, officially the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, established the European Atomic Energy Community. It was signed on 25 March 1957 at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty). The Euratom Treaty is less well known because of the lower profile of the organisation that it founded. The EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union, but Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 although it is governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own independent institutions, but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged the institutions of Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community with those of the EEC. The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment because of later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power in European public opinion. That has caused some to argue that it has become too outdated, particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the (unratified) Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which sought to combine all previous treaties, over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it. Nevertheless, it is one of the active treaties of the European Union. ==See also== * Euratom * History of the European Coal and Steel Community (1945\u20131957) * European Economic Community * Treaty establishing the European Economic Community ==References== ==External links== * * Documents of the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community on Eur-Lex * Treaties overview on EUR-Lex * Documents of Treaty of Rome's negotiations are at the Historical Archives of the EU in Florence Category:1950s in Rome Category:1957 in Europe Category:1957 in Italy Category:Treaties concluded in 1957 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1958 Category:Founding treaties of the European Union Treaty Category:Nuclear technology treaties Category:Treaties of Austria Category:Treaties of Bulgaria Category:Treaties of Belgium Category:Treaties of Croatia Category:Treaties of Cyprus Category:Treaties of the Czech Republic Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties of Estonia Category:Treaties of Finland Category:Treaties of the French Fourth Republic Category:Treaties of West Germany Category:Treaties of Greece Category:Treaties of Hungary Category:Treaties of Ireland Category:Treaties of Italy Category:Treaties of Latvia Category:Treaties of Lithuania Category:Treaties of Luxembourg Category:Treaties of Malta Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Treaties of Poland Category:Treaties of Portugal Category:Treaties of Romania Category:Treaties of Slovakia Category:Treaties of Slovenia Category:Treaties of Spain Category:Treaties of Sweden Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:Treaties extended to the \u00c5land Islands Category:March 1957 events Category:Events in Rome ",
