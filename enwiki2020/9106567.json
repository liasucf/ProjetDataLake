    "text": "{| |} Le Rh\u00f4ne was the name given to a series of popular rotary aircraft engines produced in France by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moteurs Le Rh\u00f4ne and the successor company of Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne. They powered a number of military aircraft types of the First World War. Le Rh\u00f4ne engines were also produced under license worldwide. Although not powerful (the largest wartime version produced ), they were dependable rotary engines.Le Rhone Rotary Engine Retrieved on 18 February 2009. The Le Rh\u00f4ne 9 was a development of the Le Rh\u00f4ne 7, a seven-cylinder design. Examples of nine-cylinder Le Rh\u00f4ne rotary engines are on public display in aviation museums with several remaining airworthy, powering vintage aircraft types. ==Operation== In most respects the Le Rh\u00f4ne engines were typical rotary engines, so that the crankshaft remained stationary in operation, with the entire crankcase and its attached cylinders rotating around it as a unit. The copper induction tubes had their crankcase ends located in different places on the versions; the 80 hp versions had them entering the crankcase in a location forward of the vertical center-line of each cylinder, while the 110 hp version had them located behind the cylinder's center-line. This resulted in the 80 hp version's intake plumbing being \"fully visible\" from the front, while the 110 hp version had the lower ends of its intake tubes seemingly \"hidden\" behind the cylinders. A complicated slipper bearing system was used in the Le Rh\u00f4ne engine. The master rod was of a split- type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit in the grooves. The master rod was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode in the outer groove, the shoes of three, six and nine in the middle groove and four and seven in the inner groove. Although this system was complex, the Le Rh\u00f4ne engines worked very well.Gunston 1989, p.93. The Le Rh\u00f4ne engines used an unconventional valve actuation system, with a single centrally-pivoting rocker arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve and when it moved up it opened the exhaust valve. To make this system work a two-way push-pull rod was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by using a combination of links and levers. This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements would not have been adequate at a higher power output, this should not be considered a significant design fault. ==Production== As well as production by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moteurs Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne, which had bought out Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moteurs Le Rh\u00f4ne in 1914, the Le Rh\u00f4ne was produced in Germany (by Motorenfabrik Oberursel), Austria, the United Kingdom (by Daimler), Russian Empire and Sweden. le Rh\u00f4ne engines were made under license in the United States by Union Switch and Signal of Pennsylvania, and the Oberursel Ur.II rotary engine used by Germany in World War I, in such famous fighters such as the Fokker Dr.I triplane, was a close copy of the le Rh\u00f4ne 9J version. ==Variants== Data from : Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 7A :(1910) , seven-cylinder rotary engine \u2014 twenty built for use on Borel Monoplanes and Sommer Biplanes. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 7B :(1911) , seven-cylinder rotary engine \u2014 Thirty-five prototype engines built. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 7B2 :(1912) , seven-cylinder rotary engine \u2014 350 built at Societe Moteurs le Rh\u00f4ne. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 7Z :40hp ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 9C :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 9J :(1913) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 9Ja :(1915) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 9Jb :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh\u00f4ne Type 9Jby :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine.

The Oberursel Ur.II was a straight copy of the Le Rh\u00f4ne, but the Le Rh\u00f4ne was preferred over the Oberursel due to the materials used in the French product. However, by July 1918 there was a shortage in Germany of castor oil, a plant-derived lubricant that the rotaries required, as it could not be easily dissolved into the fuel and because it possessed lubrication qualities superior to mineral oils of the day.General rotary engine lubrication information from Gnome Monosoupape Type N Rotary Retrieved on 18 February 2009. A new Voltol-based lubricant, derived from mineral oil, was substituted and was blamed for engine failures on German fighters such as the Fokker E.V, which used the Oberursel Ur.II. It has been suggested that without proper lubricants, the Le Rh\u00f4ne rotary would have been equally failure-prone. A reproduction of the Oberursel has been manufactured by The Vintage Aviator Company in New Zealand in very limited numbers by reverse engineering an original Oberursal engine, presumably for their own project aircraft. The engine has been test-run and is described at http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/projects/oberursel-engine/oberursel-ur-ii- rotary-engine-build-history. ===Le Rh\u00f4nes still flying today=== Several enthusiasts are using original Le Rh\u00f4ne engines for World War I replica aircraft today. A flying example can be seen at the Pioneer Flight Museum, Kingsbury Texas in a replica Fokker Dr 1. pioneerflightmuseum.org The engine had previously been flown in an original Thomas Morse Scout, which is now under restoration with another Le Rh\u00f4ne 80 hp engine planned for that flying aircraft. There are other reproductions of Dr 1's flying original Le Rh\u00f4ne engines, as well as the restored Thomas Morse Scouts in the United States. ==Applications== Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J mounted in the front of a Cierva C.6 autogyro replica, displayed in \"Museo del Aire\", Cuatro Vientos, Madrid, Spain A Le Rh\u00f4ne radial engine on display at the Frontiers of Flight Museum * Adamoli- Cattani fighter * Airco DH.5 * Avro 504 * Bristol M.1 * Bristol Scout * Caudron G.3 * Caudron G.4 * Hanriot HD.1 * Fokker Dr.I * Cierva C.6, autogyro, 1924 * Macchi M.14 * Morane-Saulnier N * Mosca MB 2 bis * Nieuport 10 * Nieuport 11 \"Bebe\" * Nieuport 16 * Nieuport 17, 21 & 23 * Nieuport 24 & 24bis * Nieuport 27 * Sopwith Camel * Sopwith Pup * Standard E-1 * Texas-Temple prototype * Thomas-Morse S-4C ==See also== *Clerget aircraft engines *Gnome Monosoupape *Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * Gunston, Bill.
