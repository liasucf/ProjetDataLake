In December 2011, Billboard began a Holiday Songs chart with 50 positions that monitors the last five weeks of each year to \"rank the top holiday hits of all eras using the same methodology as the Hot 100, blending streaming, airplay, and sales data\", and in 2013 the number of positions on the chart was doubled, resulting in the Holiday 100. Two Ives recordings have made appearances on the Holiday 100 and are noted below according to the holiday season in which they charted there. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=text- align:center; |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Title !colspan=\"8\"|Holiday season peak chart positions |- style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" !align=centre| 2011 !align=centre| 2012 !align=centre| 2013 !align=centre| 2014 !align=centre| 2015 !align=centre| 2016 !align=centre| 2017 !align=centre| 2018 |- | align=left |\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" | 6 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 4 | 7 | 4 | 4 |- | align=left |\"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" | 38 | \u2014 | 67 | 31 | 41 | 29 | 50 | 48 |} ===Singles (selected)=== * Foggy, Foggy Dew / Rodger Young (1945, 10 in., 78 rpm, Decca 23405) * Grandfather Kringle / The Twelve Days of Christmas (1951, 10 in., 78 rpm, Columbia MJV-124) * Great White Bird / Brighten The Corner Where You Are (1953, 7 in., 45 rpm, Decca 28849) * That's My Heart Strings / The Bus Stop Song (1956, 7 in., 45 rpm, Decca 30046) * We Loves Ye Jimmy / I Never See Maggie Alone (1959, 7 in., 45 rpm, Decca 30855) * A Little Bitty Tear / Shanghied (1961, 7 in., 45 rpm, Decca 31330) * Funny Way of Laughin' / Mother Wouldn't Do That (1962, 7 in., 45 rpm, Decca 31371) * Call Me Mr. In-Between / What You Gonna Do, Leroy?
