He graduated from Escondido High School and earned his Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from California State University, Long Beach. He resides in Long Beach, California and plays out of Virginia Country Club, along with pros John Merrick and Peter Tomasulo. Mallinger was a medalist at the 2005 Canadian Tour Qualifying School, but he earned the nickname \u201cMonday Mally\u201d by getting through several fall Monday Qualifying events and playing in enough Nationwide Tour events in 2005 to earn playing privileges for 2006 on the Nationwide Tour. He breezed through all stages of the Qualifying School that year to earn his 2007 PGA Tour Card. He earned over $1,600,000 on the PGA Tour in 2007, finishing runner-up to Brandt Snedeker for Rookie of the Year honors. He finished 91st on the 2008 money list, once again cracking the million dollar mark to retain his Tour card for 2009. Mallinger had another successful year in 2009, finishing in a tie for 3rd in the \"Fifth Major\" at The Players Championship and 2nd at the U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee where he lost a sudden death playoff to Bo Van Pelt. He finished in the top 50 of the money list for the first time.Bo Van Pelt wins PGA Milwaukee title playoff Before playing on the PGA Tour, Mallinger won two events on the NGA Hooters Tour. In 2011, Mallinger played in only 15 PGA Tour events due to his conditional status. He did not make the FedEx Cup and played on the Nationwide Tour during his time off the PGA Tour. He regained his PGA Tour card with a 14th-place finish on the Nationwide Tour money list, despite playing in only nine events, but earning six consecutive top-10 finishes. Mallinger finished in a tie for 2nd place in his second start of the 2012 PGA Tour season at the Humana Challenge, two strokes behind Mark Wilson. This was the second time that Mallinger had been a runner up on the PGA Tour and remains his best finish to date. ==Professional wins== *2010 Callaway Golf Pebble Beach Invitational ==Playoff record== PGA Tour playoff record (0\u20131) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|1 |2009 |U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee | Bo Van Pelt |Lost to birdie on second extra hole |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"center\"|Tournament !2005 !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 !2010 |- |align=left|U.S. Open |T67 |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T65 |T45 |T22 |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T60 |T60 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied Note: Mallinger never played in the Masters Tournament or The Open Championship. ==Results in The Players Championship== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012 |- |align=left|The Players Championship |T64 |CUT |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T3 |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |} CUT = missed the halfway cut \"T\" indicates a tie for a place ==See also== *2006 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates *2011 Nationwide Tour graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American male golfers Category:Long Beach State Beach men's golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Korn Ferry Tour graduates Category:Golfers from California Category:Sportspeople from Escondido, California Category:Sportspeople from Long Beach, California Category:1979 births Category:Living people ",
