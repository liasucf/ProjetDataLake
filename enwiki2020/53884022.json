    "text": "Native Invader is the fifteenth studio album (12th of entirely original material) by American singer/songwriter Tori Amos. It was released on September 8, 2017, through Decca Records. Its lead single, \"Cloud Riders\", was released on July 27, 2017. ==Background== Amos contributed the song \"Flicker\" for Netflix documentary film Audrie & Daisys ending credits. In a Billboard interview, Amos was asked about future plans, revealing there will be \"another album next year. We're in beginning stages and it might be a very different record beginning Nov. 9, but let's see where we're going.\" On April 18, Amos began a five-day countdown with a series of Instagram posts depicting a studio and a \"sacred fire\". On the fifth day, the news was revealed to be a brand new album and world tour. On April 23, an announcement was posted on Amos' official website, stating: ==Inspiration== In her fan newsletter, it states in summer 2016 Amos took a road trip through North Carolina's Smoky Mountains with intention to reconnect with the stories of her mother's family. That winter, her mother suffered a stroke. With that and the 2016 United States election, the album took a different direction. Amos states, \"It wasn't going to be a record of pain, blood and bone when I began. It wasn't going to be a record of division ... I listened and watched the conflicts that were traumatizing the nation and [wrote] about those raw emotions.\" ==Critical reception== Native Invader was well-received from music critics upon release. The album received a score of 76 out of 100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 14 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung wrote, \"Native Invader stands tall with its own vital voice and energy, alluding to beloved touchstones from throughout Amos' oeuvre while remaining fully of its time.\" Pitchfork rated the album positively, claiming that \"[Amos'] intricately arranged songs are passionate and despairingly poetic.\" ==Native Invader Tour== To promote the album, Amos embarked on the Native Invader Tour across Europe and North America. The tour began on September 6, 2017 in Cork, Ireland and concluded on December 3 in Los Angeles, California. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) N.B.
