Speech is a useless recourse in this dangerously gorgeous terrain, and the starving characters join us in simply killing time before the earth swallows them. That may be Bartas's essential idea: The waiting is the hardest part.\" ==References== ==External links== * Freedom at the production company's website Category:2000 films Category:Films directed by \u0160ar\u016bnas Bartas Category:Films set in Morocco Category:Lithuanian films Category:French- language films Category:Films produced by Paulo Branco ",
