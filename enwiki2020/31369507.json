It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 7 furlongs and 6 yards (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September. ==History== The event is named after Sceptre, a successful filly foaled in 1899. Her victories included four Classics, concluding with Doncaster's St Leger Stakes. The Sceptre Stakes used to be contested over 1 mile, and for a period it held Listed status. It was cut to 7 furlongs in 1993, and promoted to Group 3 level in 2011. The race is now staged on the opening day of Doncaster's four-day St. Leger Festival. ==Records== Most successful horse since 1986: * no horse has won this race more than once since 1986 Leading jockey since 1986 (4 wins): * Michael Hills \u2013 My Branch (1996), Mamounia (2002), Tantina (2003), Royal Confidence (2008) Leading trainer since 1986 (5 wins): * Barry Hills \u2013 Asteroid Field (1986), My Branch (1996), Mamounia (2002), Tantina (2003), Royal Confidence (2008) ==Winners since 1986== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" !
