    "text": "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends is a children's television series about the engines and other characters working on the railways of the Island of Sodor, and is based on The Railway Series books written by the Reverend W. Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the first series, which was originally broadcast in 1984. This series was initially narrated by Ringo Starr for the United Kingdom audiences, who later re-narrated 25 episodes for the United States on the American television show Shining Time Station in 1989. The entire series was narrated by George Carlin for the US audiences. All episodes from this series can be found on the DVD release Thomas: The Early Years, released by Anchor Bay Entertainment and HIT Entertainment in 2004. It was produced by Clearwater Features Ltd. for Britt Allcroft (Thomas) Ltd. ==Production== All of the stories in Series 1 were originally written by the Rev. W. Awdry, including a one-off story commissioned by the staff, Thomas' Christmas Party. The seven engines introduced in this series became the core of the cast in later episodes, with crew member (and from Series 8-12, director) Steve Asquith terming them the \"Magnificent Seven\".http://www.sodor-island.net/steveasquithinterview.html Many settings from the first series would stay with the show for years, even through its 2009 transition to CGI, such as Knapford Station, Wellsworth, Gordon's Hill, Henry's Tunnel, and Tidmouth Sheds. The pilot for the series, which was never aired on television, was an adaptation of \"Down the Mine\", which was remade entirely when the rest of the episodes were shot. ==Episodes== ==Characters introduced== * Thomas the Tank Engine (\"Thomas & Gordon\") * Edward the Blue Engine (\"Edward & Gordon\") * Henry the Green Engine (\"The Sad Story of Henry\") * Gordon the Big Engine (\"Thomas & Gordon\") * James the Red Engine (\"Thomas & the Breakdown Train\") * Percy the Small Engine (\"Trouble in the Shed\") * Toby the Tram Engine (\"Toby & the Stout Gentleman\") * Annie and Clarabel (\"Thomas & the Breakdown Train\") * Henrietta (\"Toby & the Stout Gentleman\") * Troublesome Trucks (\"Edward & Gordon\") * Terence the Tractor (\"Thomas, Terence & the Snow\") * Bertie the Bus (\"Thomas, Terence & the Snow\" / \"Thomas & Bertie\") * Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller (\"The Sad Story of Henry\") * Lady Hatt (\"Toby & the Stout Gentleman\") * Stephen Hatt (\"Toby & the Stout Gentleman\") * Bridget Hatt (\"Toby & the Stout Gentleman\") * Mrs. Kyndley (\"Thomas' Christmas Party\") ==References== Category:1984 British television seasons Category:1985 British television seasons Category:Festival Records video albums Category:Mushroom Records video albums Category:Warner Records video albums Category:Thomas & Friends seasons ",
