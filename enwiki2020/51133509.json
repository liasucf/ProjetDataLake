He is the son of actress Elizabeth Hurley and American businessman Steve Bing. ==Career== In July 2016, it was announced that Hurley had been cast as Prince Hansel von Liechtenstein in The Royals, an E! series which stars his mother as the Queen of England. Hansel plays a reality TV star in the December 2016 episode \"Aye, There's the Rub\". He reprised the role in the April 2018 episode \"My News Shall Be the Fruit to That Great Feast\". In September 2018, Hurley was signed by model agency Tess Management. ==Personal life== Hurley was born in Portland Hospital, London to actress Elizabeth Hurley and American businessman Steve Bing. Although Bing initially denied paternity, a DNA test subsequently confirmed him as the father. In a court settlement, Bing agreed to pay \u00a31.8 million in annual installments of \u00a3100,000 for Hurley, although his mother has declined to accept the payments. Hurley's godfathers include Hugh Grant, David Beckham, Elton John, and Denis Leary. Hurley grew up in Gloucester with his mother and her then-spouse Indian business tycoon Arun Nayar. Hurley later lived part time in Australia because of his mother's relationship with Australian cricket player Shane Warne. Hurley's father died by suicide on 22 June 2020, at the age of 55, by jumping from his apartment on the 27th floor of a building in the Century City neighbourhood of Los Angeles. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 births Category:21st-century English male actors Category:English male soap opera actors Category:English people of American-Jewish descent Category:Male actors from London Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:English male child actors Category:English male television actors Category:English male models ",
