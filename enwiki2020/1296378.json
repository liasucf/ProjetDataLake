    "text": "\"Dumb\" is a song by the American rock band, Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the sixth song on the band's third and final studio album, In Utero, released in 1993. Despite never being released as a single, the song reached number 37 on the US Alternative National Airplay chart, which was published by the Billboard sister publication, Radio & Records. ==Origin and recording== \"Dumb\" was written by Cobain in the summer of 1990, after he had begun to explore the more pop-influenced side of his songwriting.Crisafulli (1996). p. 93. Two lyrics sheets for the song were published posthumously in Journals in November 2002, one under the working title of \"I Think I'm Dumb,\" with a note that the lyrics were \"Not Finished,\" and the titles of two songs by Scottish rock band the Vaselines, \"Molly's Lips\" and \"Slushy,\" written under the title. The song was debuted live on September 25, 1990, when Cobain performed a solo acoustic version on the Boy Meets Girl show, hosted by Calvin Johnson of the American rock band Beat Happening, on KAOS (FM) in Olympia, Washington.St. Thomas (2004). p. 66.Gillian G. Gaar (2009). The first live version featuring the full band was at the Off Ramp Caf\u00e9 in Seattle, Washington on November 25, 1990. On September 3, 1991, the band recorded a version of the song, already featuring finished lyrics, during their second John Peel session for the BBC at Maida Vale Studios in London.St. Thomas (2004). p. 107. The full session, which also featured versions of \"Drain You\" and \"Endless Nameless\" from their then-latest release, Nevermind, was produced by Dale Griffin, and first broadcast on November 3, 1991. Three studio versions of the song were recorded by Jack Endino on October 26, 1992, at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington, but all were instrumental, as were all the other songs recorded during this session, except for one take of \"Rape Me\".Gaar (2006). pp.17, 18, 19, 20. The final studio version of \"Dumb\" was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February 1993, and was released on In Utero in September 1993. The recording features Kera Schaley on cello, who also played on the album's closing track, \"All Apologies.\" All subsequent live versions of both songs featured cello, although never by Schaley, who did not tour with the band. On November 18, 1993, the band performed an acoustic version of \"Dumb\" during their MTV Unplugged appearance at Sony Music Studios in New York City. This version featured Pat Smear on second guitar and Lori Goldston on cello. The song was performed, along with \"Serve the Servants,\" at Nirvana's final television appearance, on February 23, 1994 in Rome, Italy for the RAI television show, Tunnel. This version featured Melora Creager on cello. \"Dumb\" was performed for the final time live at Nirvana's last concert, on March 1, 1994 at Terminal Einz in Munich, Germany. ==Composition and lyrics== ===Music=== Journalist Gillian G. Gaar noted that \"Dumb\" was one of the few Nirvana songs to remain \"low-key from beginning to end,\" comparing it to the Bleach song, \"About a Girl.\"Gaar (2006). p. 18. Like \"About a Girl,\" the song has been described as \"Beatlesque.\" Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic called it \"a beautiful song. That's a really good one. I like the BBC version of the song. It's real raw, but still the beauty is strong. A sweet pop song.\"Gaar (2006). p. 59. ===Lyrics=== In a 1993 interview with Melody Maker, Cobain explained that the song was \"just about people who're easily amused, people who not only aren't capable of progressing their intelligence but are totally happy watching 10 hours of television and really enjoy it. I've met a lot of dumb people. They have a shitty job, they may be totally lonely, they don't have a girlfriend, they don't have much of a social life, and yet, for some reason, they're happy.\" Though written before Cobain's addiction to heroin, \"Dumb\" is also one of the few Nirvana songs to directly reference drug use. In Cobain's unused liner notes for the song, he blamed \"all that supposedly unaddictive, harmless\" marijuana for harming his nerves and damaging his memory, saying it \"wasn't ever strong enough\" which led him to \"climb the ladder\" to heroin. In 2015, Kurt's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, offered her own interpretation of the song in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying, \"I cry every time I hear that song. It's a stripped-down version of Kurt's perception of himself \u2013 of himself on drugs, off drugs, feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation.\" ==Reception== In his review of In Utero for Rolling Stone, David Fricke cited \"Dumb,\" along with \"Heart-Shaped Box,\" as evidence that if Generation X \"is ever going to have its own Lennon...Cobain is damn near it.\" Will Bryant of Pitchfork called the song \"one of Cobain's most underrated efforts, a populist revision of \"Lithium\" that replaces Nevermind's misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation.\" Bryant praised Kera Schaley's cello playing as the song's \"secret weapon,\" and the bridge as \"hands down, Cobain's best.\" In a 1993 Rolling Stone interview, Cobain told Fricke that he wished he had put more songs like \"Dumb\" and \"All Apologies\" on previous Nirvana albums, saying that Nirvana had so far \"failed in showing the lighter, more dynamic side of our band.\" Though never released as a single, \"Dumb\" has become a popular song on American alternative rock radio, and was played on European radio.
