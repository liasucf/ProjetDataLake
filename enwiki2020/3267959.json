    "text": "S\u00f3lo con tu pareja () is a 1991 Mexican film by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. This was the first full-feature film for Cuar\u00f3n who had previously worked at Televisa, a Mexican television company. The stars of this film are Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho (the narrator on Cuar\u00f3n's second Mexican film Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n) and telenovela star Claudia Ram\u00edrez. After Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and his brother Carlos Cuar\u00f3n wrote the script, they needed to secure financing. The government of Mexico's IMCINE (Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf\u00eda) had already decided what films they would finance that year. However, one of the projects was canceled and the IMCINE funds were assigned to S\u00f3lo con tu pareja. After the film was completed, the Mexican government refused to distribute it, but S\u00f3lo con tu pareja was presented at several international festivals. It won awards at the Ariel Awards (by the Mexican Academy of Film) and at the Toronto Festival of Festivals. After this international recognition the movie was finally shown in 1993 in its country of origin where it became a box-office success. It occupies the 87th place on the list of the 100 best movies of the cinema of Mexico. In 2006, Criterion Collection released S\u00f3lo con tu pareja in DVD (Region 1), with a new remastered transfer and with the shorts Noche de Bodas by Carlos Cuar\u00f3n and Cuarteto Para el Fin Del Tiempo (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's first short, made when he was a film student in 1983). ==Plot== Tom\u00e1s Tom\u00e1s, a womanizing bachelor who works in advertising, is having an affair with his boss Gloria. After visiting his doctor Mateo, who is also his friend and neighbor, he is struck by the new nurse Silvia and starts an affair with her too. When she finds out about Gloria, she falsifies the results of his blood test, notifying him that he has AIDS. He meanwhile has been struck by his neighbour Clarisa, a flight attendant engaged to a pilot Carlos, but realizes he cannot pursue her now. In despair at his fate, he decides to commit suicide. While contemplating various methods, Clarisa bursts in in despair. She has found Carlos in bed with another woman and wants to end her life, so the two decide to go to the Torre Latinoamericana and jump from the top. Tom\u00e1s leaves a voice message for Mateo and in the middle of the night the pair set off. When Mateo gets the message among friends at a party, he rushes to the Torre with the whole group, including his wife Teresa, Carlos, and Silvia. At the top, Tom\u00e1s tells Clarisa he loves her but can go no further because he has AIDS. She says, since they are both about to die, that does not now matter and the two make ecstatic love. Climbing the emergency stairs, Silvia calls out that the blood test was not positive. Instead of jumping, the lovers think about marrying. ==Awards== ===Ariel Award in 1992=== *Best Original Story - Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n & Carlos Cuar\u00f3n Also nominated for: *Best Cinematography - Emmanuel Lubezki *Best First Feature Film - Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n *Best Screenplay - Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n & Carlos Cuar\u00f3n ==Cast== * Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho as Tom\u00e1s Tom\u00e1s * Claudia Ram\u00edrez as Clarisa Negrete * Luis de Icaza as doctor Mateo Mateos * Dobrina Liubomirova as Silvia Silva * Astrid Hadad as Teresa de Teresa * Isabel Benet as Gloria Gold * Toshir\u00f4 Hisaki as Takeshi * Carlos Nakasone as Koyi * Ricardo Dalmacci as Carlos * Claudia Fern\u00e1ndez as Luc\u00eda * Luz Mar\u00eda Jerez as Paola * Nevil Wilton as Pasmal * John Keys as Absolut Boozer * Ra\u00fal Valerio as guard at the Torre Latinoamericana * Montserrat Ontiveros as Mrs. Panza * Regina Orozco as Mrs. Dolores * Rodolfo Arias as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s on the commercial for \"Jalape\u00f1os Caseros G\u00f3mez\" * V\u00edctor Carpinteiro as Montezuma on the commercial for \"Jalape\u00f1os Caseros G\u00f3mez\" * Claudette Maill\u00e9 as la Burbus * Ariel L\u00f3pez Padilla as Burbus' boyfriend * Marcos Mohar as boy at the elevator * Jiussana Brise\u00f1o as Nancy of Continental Airlines * Arturo R\u00edos as contratenor in a dream about the Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n plane * Adriana Olivera as voice of the beeper operator * Jon\u00e1s Cuar\u00f3n as Kid at Wedding ==External links== * S\u00f3lo con tu pareja at the Cinema of Mexico page of the ITESM * * *S\u00f3lo con tu pareja: Sex, Lies, and Mariachis an essay by Ryan F.
