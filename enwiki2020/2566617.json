    "text": "Christian hardcore (or Christcore) refers to hardcore punk bands that promote Christian beliefs. How these bands promote Christianity, and to what extent, varies between bands. Christian hardcore bands often openly state their beliefs and employ Christian imagery in their lyrics, and may be considered a part of the Christian music industry. Fans of Christian hardcore music are not exclusively believers in the Christian religion. Thanks to some innovators in the hardcore movement such as Extol, Zao, Living Sacrifice, and the hardcore movement in general, the audience has become less exclusive. Though the audience of Christian music has changed over the years, the same underlying message of hope and truth still remains a cornerstone in the lyrics of Christian hardcore. ==Related genres== *Christian punk *Christian rock *Christian alternative rock *Christian metal ==See also== *List of Christian hardcore bands ==External links== *Christian Hardcore Interviews and Information *God Save the Teens: Local Kids Seek a New Kind of Church Through Hardcore and Hip-Hop by Lauren Sandler in the Village Voice 30 May - 5 June 2001 *Review As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean by Ben Bishop in HM Magazine *Rock and Pop > Christian Punk and Hardcore in the Yahoo!
