On that date Knife 04 was chalk two on a short notice tasking for an urgent personnel recovery mission behind enemy lines. Due to severe weather along the route and a radar malfunction in the lead aircraft, Knife 04 assumed lead in an attempt to get the formation clear of the weather. While flying through the blinding weather, the two aircraft lost sight of one another. As Knife 04 tried to relocate their wingman, they lost radio contact. Contacting airborne command and control assets, Knife 04 confirmed that the other aircraft was on the ground. Several attempts to reach the downed crewmembers that had sustained injuries and were now exposed to subzero temperatures and enemy ground forces were unsuccessful. Knife 04 began coordinating the first of four aerial refuelings and initiated on scene command responsibilities while evading bad weather and taking enemy ground fire. As the weather cleared, Knife 04 located the crash site and began an approach to the rugged area. The extremely slim power margin forced them to dump all but the very minimum fuel required for the approach. After a perilous landing, the downed aircrew were brought aboard. The takeoff in blinding snow with rotor speed decreasing to dangerous levels was accomplished through superior effort and ability from the crew. During the egress from hostile territory, Knife 04 was forced to aerially refuel several times as the minimum power margin prohibited their loading all of the required fuel in one engagement. |- |2002|| GRIM 31 16th Special Operations Squadron || For rescuing 82 U.S. Army soldiers, including 28 wounded, trapped in a rugged valley in Afghanistan by Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces.

On 26 March 2003, Vijay 10 led Operation Northern Delay with an airdrop of 1,000 members of the US Army 173rd Airborne Brigade soldiers over Bashur, Iraq which opened the northern front to combat operations. After the initial insertion, Vijay 10 crewmembers, along with active and reserve crews from Charleston and McChord Air Force Bases flew four more night missions. |- |2004 || Crew of Jolly 11 First Lieutenant Bryan Creel Captain Joseph Galletti Staff Sergeant Vincent J. Eckert Staff Sergeant John Griffin Staff Sergeant Patrick Ledbetter Sergeant Thomas Ringheimer Crew of Jolly 12 Captain Rob Wrinkle First Lieutenant Gregory Rockwood Tech Sergeant Michael Preston Tech Sergeant Paul Silver Staff Sergeant Matthew Leigh Staff Sergeant Michael Rubio Senior Airman Edward Ha || Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 crewmembers distinguished themselves by gallantry in connection with rescue operations near Kharbut, Iraq, on 16 April 2004. While supporting of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Jolly 11 Flight launched to rescue a five-person crew of a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook that crashed in a sandstorm with near zero-visibility. En route to the crash scene, crews realized their forward looking infra-red and night vision goggles were ineffective. Despite this handicap the crew of Jolly 11 was able to locate the survivors. Both aircraft then made near zero-visibility approaches relying nearly exclusively on the flight engineers and aerial gunners inputs for precision navigation. Following the successful survivor contacts and recovery by the Flight's Pararescuemen, Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 were individually engaged by separate multiple surface-to-air missiles attacks. Using evasive maneuvers Jolly 11 evaded two missiles. Both Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 continued to provide support with defensive fire until the formation was clear of the threat area saving the lives of five U.S. Army personnel. |- |2005C-130 Crew Honored with Mackay Trophy || Crew of Train 60 Major Michael S. Frame Major Brian Lewis Master Sergeant Tommy Lee Master Sergeant John Spillane Tech Sergeant Corey Turner || Train 60 crewmembers were C-130 Hercules instructors for the newly formed Iraqi Air Force. The crew's unprecedented mission was to act as the inaugural Iraqi \"Air Force One\" and take the Iraq Prime Minister from Baghdad to Al Sulaymania to meet with Kurdish leaders. During the mission, Train 60 crewmembers instructed Iraqi aircrew members on flight procedures in a combat environment, quickly improvised a low-level route through mountains to avoid low ceilings and landed on a taxi way at an uncontrolled and uncompleted Iraqi airfield that did not have an American security presence. Their efforts ensured the safety of the all Iraqi crew and the Iraqi head of state during this landmark airlift event. |- |2006A-10 pilot awarded Mackay Trophy || Captain Scott Markle || A-10 pilot Captain Markle was diverted to support special forces troops along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in contact with Taliban forces. He arrived just before dawn and heavy gunfire and tracers and poor visibility made it difficult to find the team's location. Captain Markle, unable to employ weapons due to the enemy's close proximity to the team, flew a dangerously low pass over the area while releasing self-protection flares. When flares momentarily halted enemy fire. The ground controller requested a few more close passes to the special forces team time to create more distance between themselves and the Taliban. The separation allowed Captain Markle to strafe the enemy area with more than 1,000 30 millimeter rounds on his final pass. The special forces team was able to disengage with no casualties. Captain Markle was credited with destroying three machine gun nests and killing 40 enemy combatants. |- |2007F-16 Pilots receive Mackay Trophy || Panther 11 Flight Colonel Charles Moore Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Williams Captain Lawrence Sullivan Captain Kristopher Struve || A 4-ship formation of F-16 Fighting Falcons based at Joint Base Balad, Iraq flew an 11-hour mission over 6 countries and requiring 13 air refuelings supported ground operations in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan |- |2008B-1B crew to get Mackay Trophy for bombing run || Crew of Bone 23 Major Norman Shelton Captain Kaylene Giri Captain Louis Heidema Captain Boyd Smith || Confronting a two hundred-strong enemy force that was attempting to overrun their base, the Joint Terminal Attack Controller requested a two thousand pound guided weapon. When the crew of BONE 23 realized friendly forces were in Danger Close range, they suggested a five hundred pound guided weapon, instead. Faced with a critical fuel situation, the crew coordinated to move their tanker closer providing more time on station and, within thirty minutes, BONE 23 accomplished three bomb runs decisively slowing the enemy attack, allowing coalition forces to regroup. |- |200933d Rescue Squadron crew earns MacKay Trophy US Air Force, 20 May 2010, retrieved 20 May 2010 || Crew of Pedro 16 Captain Robert Rosebrough First Lieutenant Lucas Will Master Sergeant Dustin Thomas Staff Sergeant Tim Philpott ||The crews of \"Pedro 15\" and \"Pedro 16\" operating HH-60G Pavehawks came under enemy fire 29 July 2009 during a medical evacuation mission as part of the 129th Expeditionary Rescue Squadron at Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan. Three Soldiers had been wounded near Forward Operating Base Frontenac when their convoy was hit with an improvised explosive device and became engaged by enemy combatants. During the recovery operation \"Pedro 15\" was downed by enemy fire, injuring the crew. \"Pedro 16\", along with Army OH-58 Kiowas, suppressed enemy fire.
