    "text": "The Scottish Singles Sales Chart and Scottish Albums Sales Chart are charts compiled by the Official Charts Company, based on physical and digital sales in Scotland. The Scottish Singles Sales Chart and Scottish Albums Sales Chart are regional listings that indicate how the UK Singles Chart and UK Albums Chart are being contributed to from Scotland. Currently, these charts are based only on paid-for sales so, with the growth of streaming, they only reflect a minority of the music consumption in Scotland. ==History== In the late 1970s and early 1980s Radio & Record News and Record Business magazines compiled Scottish charts which were broadcast on Independent Local Radio stations such as Radio Clyde and Radio Forth; these showed particular favour for hard rock, punk and new wave while soul and other \"black\" styles would fare less well; for example, on 23 June 1978, Radio & Record News placed Heatwave at number 15 UK-wide but number 40 in Scotland, The O'Jays at number 21 UK-wide but not in the Scottish Top 40 and Bob Marley at number 26 UK-wide but not in the Scottish Top 40, but AC/DC at number 38 UK-wide and number 20 in Scotland, The Clash at number 62 UK-wide and number 22 in Scotland, and The Vibrators at number 65 UK-wide but number 39 in Scotland.Radio & Record News UK-wide and Scottish charts for 23 June 1978. In the late 1980s, as frustration in Scotland at perceived isolation from the Thatcher government grew, pressure was applied for the creation of an official Scottish chart; Brian Guthri of the Scottish Record Industry Association claimed that the official UK charts did not pick up many sales by Scottish acts as they were not polling enough shops in Scotland, citing Win's \"You've Got the Power\" (the theme song from McEwan's Lager adverts) as an example\"Scots plan break away music chart\", The Stage and Television Today, 23 March 1989 and a month of research determined significant differences from the UK charts, with indie acts selling particularly well.\"Scotland gets own hit parade\" (sic), The Stage and Television Today, 11 May 1989 That autumn, the SRIA voted to set up its own chart, suggesting that the balance of 75 chart return shops in Greater London to 45 in Scotland was unfair.\"SRIA hits back at 'English bias'\", The Stage and Television Today, 19 October 1989 Although a Scottish chart had been broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland beforehand,See for example listings in the Newcastle Journal, 4 May 1990 the first official Scottish Gallup charts were published on 17 March 1991; notably, they placed Scottish band The Silencers at number 6 in the album chart (only number 39 UK-wide) and The Simpsons' album higher than the Inspector Morse soundtrack, which was 11 places higher UK-wide.Record Mirror - UK charts for 23 March 1991 The launch of this chart was heralded by Neil Ross of the Scottish Record Industry Association, who again suggested that the UK charts were disproportionately slanted towards sales in London and the south of England, while music manager Bruce Findlay suggested that Scotland could potentially produce a music TV show with as much international appeal as the then-popular DEF II series Rapido.\"Putting Scotland on the map\", The Stage and Television Today, 18 April 1991 From 20 September 1991, a short weekly TV programme based around the Scottish chart was broadcast by BBC1 Scotland on Friday nights, hosted by Nicky Campbell, then of Radio 1\"New Series\", The Stage and Television Today, 19 September 1991 and the chart continued to be broadcast on Monday nights on BBC Radio Scotland.See many listings in the Perthshire Advertiser up to May 1993 Frankie Miller's song \"Caledonia\", also included in McEwan's adverts which were only shown in Scotland and Northern Ireland, topped the Scottish chart while only being a minor UK-wide hit.Perthshire Advertiser, 10 April 1992 An unofficial Scottish Network Chart was also taken by Scottish commercial stations, including Radio Tay, in the early 1990s.See many listings in the Perthshire Advertiser from 18 January 1991 to 14 October 1994, with two further listings in November 1996. Archives on the Official Charts Company website go back to February 1994, when Millward Brown took over as chart compilers and the number of retailers sampled throughout the UK increased.Official Scottish Singles Chart Top 100: 27 February 1994 \u2013 5 March 1994 Official Charts Company After this relaunch, Scottish Television launched a show based around the official Scottish chart, called Chart Bite.\"Television News: It'll be an even later night for the South Bank Show in Scotland\", The Stage and Television Today, 10 February 1994 Until 2000, the Scottish album chart included albums eligible only for the compilation album chart at a UK-wide level. How the UK and Scottish charts have been complied have diverged several times since 1994. Whereas digital downloads were incorporated into the UK singles chart from July 2005 and albums from April 2006, the Scottish charts remained physical sales only until the week ending 10 October 2009 when digital sales were finally included. This brought how the two charts were compiled in line for almost five years until the week ending 6 July 2014, when streaming was included in the UK singles chart. Streaming was later included in the UK album chart for the week ending 1 March 2015. As of 2020, the Scottish charts remain complied of digital and physical sales only, therefore only representing a minority of music consumption in Scotland. ==Number ones== ===1994=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:center;\" |- !
