    "text": "Lee Greer Brewster (April 27, 1943 \u2013 May 19, 2000) was an American drag queen, transvestite activist, and retailer. He was a founding member of the pre- Stonewall activist group, Queens Liberation Front and in the 1970s and 1980s published Drag magazine. Brewster helped to raise funds for the very first U.S. celebration of Pride, Christopher Street Liberation Day 1970. He continued to help raise funds and organize Christopher Street Liberation Day for several years. Lee Brewster was active in the homophile and gay liberation movements, working with the Mattachine Society of New York as well as the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. == Personal life == Lee Brewster was born in a log cabin in Honaker, Virginia on April 27, 1943. He was primarily raised in West Virginia, where his father was a coal miner. He moved to New York City in the 1960s after being fired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for being a homosexual. Brewster died of cancer on May 19, 2000 in New York City. He was survived by a sister and three brothers. == Professional life == Brewster worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a file clerk in the early 1960s, until he was fired for being a homosexual. In the 1970s and 1980s, he published Drag magazine. === Lee's Mardi Gras Boutique === Brewster owned Lee's Mardi Gras Boutique (now Michael Salem Boutique), a clothing store in a loft on West 14th Street in New York City's Greenwich Village. The store catered heavily to drag performers. He announced its opening on October 31, 1969 at a ball he was hosting. He described it as the first one devoted to cross-dressers. Initially the business was mail order based, but after so many people began coming directly to his apartment, he opened a store around the corner from his Hell's Kitchen apartment. It included a bookstore with a comprehensive collection of books on topics related to transvestites. The store moved several times before arriving at its location on West 14th Street. His boutique made efforts to provide privacy to its customers, including never having a street-level entry. However, some customers have been public about utilizing the store. Among its public and notable customers were Lady Bunny, and costume designers for The Birdcage, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, and Tootsie. Brewster described his clientele in an interview in The Village Voice saying, \"Half of my clients are respectable-looking businessmen,\" and that they were \"very normal, but they know better than to present that side of themselves.\" == Drag performances == Brewster staged numerous balls and often performed as a drag queen. Following the tradition of old-time drag performers, Brewster preferred to be called by male pronouns, rather than female pronouns, as has become more popular in modern time. == Activism == Brewster advocated for people who wanted to engage in cross-dressing, notably at times when this was an unpopular position in the LGBT movement in the United States. He became active in the Mattachine Society after moving to New York City in the 1960s, and was even nominated for the position of Secretary of the organization. He coordinated the organization's drag balls and fundraising events. Some members of the organizations disliked public cross-dressing, so he began holding the balls at the Diplomat Hotel on West 43rd Street. The balls, held from 1969 to 1973, became notable enough that the final one was attended by Carol Channing, Shirley MacLaine and Jacqueline Susann. In the 1970s, Brewster financed a successful legal challenge to a New York City ordinance that allowed people to be removed from public places because they were homosexuals. Though seldom enforced, he felt the regulation gave law enforcement an opportunity to harass LGBT people. === Queens Liberation Front === At his first ball in February 1969, he announced plans to form what would become known as the Queens Liberation Front, with October 31, 1969 to be its formal founding date. Lesbian Feminist Liberation opposed the performance by drag queens at the 1973 LGBT Pride March in New York City. As they passed out flyers, Sylvia Rivera, of Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, took the microphone from emcee Vito Russo and spoke against the sentiment and spoke of the harassment and arrests of drag queens on the street, some of whom had been involved with the Stonewall riots. Lesbian Feminist Liberation's Jean O'Leary then insisted on responding by denouncing drag as misogynist and criticizing the march for being too male-dominated. This prompted Brewster to denounce anti-transgender lesbian feminists. The increasingly angry crowd only calmed when Bette Midler, who heard on the radio in her Greenwich Village apartment, arrived, took the microphone, and began singing \"Friends\". This was one of many events in early 1970s where lesbian and transgender activists clashed. === Collaboration with Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.) === ==== March on Albany ==== The Queens Liberation Front, including founders Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower, joined with S.T.A.R. including Sylvia Rivera to lead a protest for the repeal of crossdressing laws in New York. They marched to the Capital in Albany, \"...in support of the bills currently before the legislators in behalf of liberalized laws on homosexuality. Amongst them are bill for the repeal of impersonation laws...\". The groups and their supporters travelled to Albany on four buses that had been chartered by the NY Gay Activists Alliance. Other notable protest attendees included Reverend Troy Perry. Drag Magazine includes two full pages of photographs from the protest, including Lee Brewster and Sylvia Rivera together holding their protest signs. ==== Panel Discussion with Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson ==== In 1972, Lee Brewster was part of a panel discussion on \"transvestism\" with S.T.A.R. representatives Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson and \"Bebe\" representing of the Queens College Group. The coverage of this event and a corresponding photograph of the panel can be found in Drag magazine Vol.2 No.7, near the end of the article on Male Prostitution. == See also == * History of the transgender community in the United States * LGBT movements in the United States == References == Category:1943 births Category:2000 deaths Category:American civil rights activists Category:American drag queens Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Category:Gay entertainers Category:LGBT businesspeople from the United States Category:LGBT history in New York City Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:LGBT people from Virginia Category:Transgender rights activists Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:Activists from New York City ",
