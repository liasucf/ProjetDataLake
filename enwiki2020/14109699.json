    "text": "Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures is a nature documentary video/television series that ran in first-run syndication from 1993 to 2008 and has since been rerun. The series was hosted by Jack Hanna, Director Emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. It is shown weekly in syndication across the country on numerous stations and networks. It is particularly popular in part because of Hanna's mainstream name recognition as an animal expert, but also because the show meets programming criteria for federally mandated educational and informational requirements which all stations must follow. Because of this, the program is available for syndication up to five days per week, thus covering all but a half hour of the three-hour E/I mandate. == External links == * * * Category:1993 American television series debuts Category:2008 American television series endings Category:1990s American children's television series Category:2000s American children's television series Category:Litton Entertainment Category:Nature educational television series Category:Television series about animals Category:English-language television shows Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States ",
