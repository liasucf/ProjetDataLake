    "text": "1875 was the 89th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Nottinghamshire regained its place as the unofficial \"Champion County\". It was in many ways the last season before pitches began to improve and produce much heavier scoring: it was definitely the last season where \"dead shooters\" were frequently seen at Lord's\"The Memorial Biography of Dr. W.G. Grace\" before the heavy roller made for regular bounce there. ==Champion County== * Nottinghamshire ===Playing record (by county)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! County !! Played !! Won !!

Although there are ante- dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketer\u2019s Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1876 * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1876 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1876 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1875 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
