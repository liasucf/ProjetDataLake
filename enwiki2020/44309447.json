    "text": "Al-Rahim Mosque or al-Raheem is the one and only mosque in the area of Dubai Marina, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Masjid means mosque. \"Al-Rahim\" could be translated by \"the merciful\" or \"the forgiving\". Al-Rahim mosque is almost at the southest point of Dubai Marina. It is opened since October 2013. == History == The mosque was built at the request of HH (His Highness - HH) Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates . Its construction took between 3 and 4 years. It is open to the public since October 2013 . == Architecture == Rahim al-Masjid meets the basic criteria of Islamic architecture . It includes a minaret, high tower from which the imam (or officer Imam) calls to prayer (the role of the muezzin is here taken by the imam ). The mosque is crowned by a single dome, symbolic representation of the vault of heaven in Islamic architecture. It also includes a Ziyada, that is to say, a patio surrounded by a double wall . The facade of the mosque turned to the marina is bordered by a waterfall. In the evening, the chamber is illuminated with white and blue colors. The mosque is composed of two speakers: The first speaker is mainly made of the prayer room devoted to men whose entrance faces the patio. On the floor of the same block is the smallest prayer room devoted to women whose entrance is oriented outwards. Their floor, far and through glass coated with an opaque film sandblasted silver, women can observe the prayer room for men below. Women have their own room with ablution with seating \"high-tech\" with motion detectors. The second enclosure comprises three separate rooms. The part facing the patio houses the great hall of ablutions for the toilet men before prayer. The outward-facing side (almost like an annex partially hidden) houses a Koranic school and a library devoted to Islamic studies, both on behalf of His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan . ==Other== According to the Auxiliary of the imam, the mosque could accommodate up to 2,000 people. It is especially crowded on Friday between 11h and 13h (during the midday prayer in Arabic called adh-Dhuhr and which usually takes place around 12:30 pm) and during special Islamic festivals such as the Eid . Masjid al-Rahim is not really a tourist place (except that it is often photographed from the outside) and remains primarily a place of prayer. == See also == * Mosqu\u00e9e al-Rahim - Translation ==References== Category:Mosques in Dubai Category:Mosque buildings with domes Category:Mosques completed in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in the United Arab Emirates ",
