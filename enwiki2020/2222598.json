    "text": "Parokya ni Edgar (lit: Edgar's Parish) is a Filipino band formed in 1993. The band is known for its original rock novelty songs and often satirical covers of popular songs both foreign and local. The band is adept at playing in various musical genres. Parokya ni Edgar has been referred to by local media outlets and numerous award-giving bodies as \"Pambansang Banda ng Pilipinas\" (The National Band of the Philippines). Despite having \"Edgar\" in the band's name, none of the members are named Edgar. ==History== ===Formation and early years=== Originally named Comic Relief, the band's initial members were a group of high school students composed of vocalists Chito Miranda, Jeric Estaco, and Vinci Montaner, along with guitarists Mikko Yap and Gab Chee Kee, all hailing from Ateneo de Manila University. They were regulars in after- school jam sessions, before performing an opening number for an Eraserheads concert. This served as their break in the music industry and prompted them to add a drummer and bassist \u2013 Ateneo schoolmate Dindin Moreno and Miranda's childhood friend Buwi Meneses, respectively. Around the same time they changed the band's name to Parokya ni Edgar. After high school, Mikko and Jeric withdrew from the band to pursue other interests. Soon after, the remaining band members invited Darius Sema\u00f1a, Meneses's former bandmate, to take the role of lead guitar. ===Career=== ====Name origin==== The band name's origin had been a subject of debate among fans as the band members had never given full confirmation. It was not until 2013 that Chito Miranda officially addressed it through a post on their Facebook page. The title \"Parokya Ni Edgar\" came from a joke a classmate named Bambi Cuna made during one of their high school classes. Sources state that the class subject was Filipino. When the teacher asked Cuna where Jose Rizal's fictional hero, Crisostomo Ibarra (in the novel Noli Me Tangere) was educated, it was said that Cuna made up a daft answer, \"sa Parokya ni Edgar\". Then-vocalist Jeric Estaco decided on impromptu to introduce the band as \"Parokya ni Edgar\" in their first live performance. From there, the band name just stuck. ====Mainstream==== By the late 1990s, PNE became regular performers in Club Dredd, a popular club in Manila at the time. The band slowly gained popularity during the height of the Filipino rock explosion, with the local rock community welcoming the influence of foreign grunge acts such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Eventually, the late managing director of Universal Records, Bella Dy Tan, signed them as contract artists after witnessing one of their Club Dredd performances. Soon, their initial recordings \"Buloy\", \"Trip (Siopao Na Special)\" and \"Lutong Bahay (Cooking Ng Ina Mo)\" gained radio airplay. Their first album, Khangkhungkherrnitz (1996) became a triple platinum hit in the Philippines, having sold 120,000 units. The next albums were equal successes - Buruguduystunstugudunstuy (1997) was awarded triple platinum, Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow (1998) with gold, and Gulong Itlog Gulong (1999) with triple platinum. This included the single \"Halaga\", one of the most popular songs in their career. \"Halaga\" was such a hit in the country that it further boosted PNE's career, cementing their name into OPM history. In 1999, 2 years after Eraserheads won as Best Southeast Asian Music Video Award Winner for \"Ang Huling El Bimbo\" in 1997, Parokya won as Best Southeast Asian Music Video Award Moon Man Winner for the music video, \"Harana\" in the MTV Music Video Music Awards 1999 was also held in New York City, Parokya was the 2nd OPM Rock band & last MTV Music Video Awards Winner Moon Man Trophy after Eraserheads and in 2001, Kyla won as the last Filipino OPM Performer to win the MTV Award winner for the entry for the music video \"Hanggang Ngayon\". The same year, Parokya is also popular to perform mostly on Television and also on radio shows for upcoming gigs and new albums to come. After a five-year hiatus, they released their junior studio album Edgar Edgar Musikahan in 2002. On July 14, 2003, they released the studio album Bigotilyo, with the main single \"Mr. Suave\". \"Mr. Suave\" proved to be just as popular as its predecessors and stayed on the music charts for more than a year. The song became so popular in the Philippines that a few commercials and political campaigns borrowed stanzas from it. Same Year in 2003, Parokya celebrated their 10th Year Anniversary with new gigs and concerts in various shows in the Philippines and also around the world like Hong Kong, Canada such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario & more Canadian provinces tour were performed for PNE, and the United States such as New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Arizona, California and among other U.S. States. were performed by PNE. 2004 was the year of release of Inuman Sessions Vol. 1, PNE's first compilation DVD album celebrating their 11th anniversary. The DVD showcased the band's prerecorded live studio performance of their hit songs to a selected audience. The DVD album met success in sales nationwide. They released their 8th studio album, Middle-Aged Juvenile Novelty Pop Rockers in 2010 with the single \"Paki-usap Lang (Lasingin Nyo Ako)\". The album was met with moderate success in both charts and sales. In 2011, PNE joined the roster of Tanduay's First Five and RockFest replacing long running Tanduay endorser 6cyclemind. The following year, PNE released their 2nd compilation DVD album Inuman Sessions Vol. 2 - a follow up to their Inuman Sessions Vol. 1. Later that same year, Montaner officially left the band on good terms with both the members and crew. 2013 marked PNE's 20th anniversary in the OPM industry. The band launched their 13th album Bente as commemoration, and as this was a milestone, Vinci Montaner temporarily reunited with the band for the album's cover art and signings. In 2014, PNE was awarded with the MYX Magna Award for their artistic contribution to OPM Rock History & also celebrating their 20th anniversary of their opm rock band of the mid 1990s. They are the 2nd OPM Rock Band to receive this award after Eraserheads in 2009. All throughout 2015, the band toured selected cities in the United States; they headlined at the Landmark Loews Theater in Jersey City, New Jersey on March 21, 2015.EventBrite website, accessed March 10, 2015. That same year, the band began recording for their next album and contained the tracks \"Sing\" and \"Lagi Mong Tatandaan\", the former featuring Rico Blanco. Their 9th studio album and their 14th overall album is entitled Pogi Years Old. The cover album was revealed on September 2, 2016 through their Facebook page and expected to be released by 2016. Former member Vinci Montaner will appear on the album as a featured artist. On September 9, 2016, the band held a free surprise show at the Bonifacio Shrine in Manila. The album was released on October 17, 2016 nationwide and on digital format. The band would held an album launch at Eastwood Central Plaza on October 16, 2016. This marks the return of Vinci Montaner, who would join permanently days later. On November 22, 2017, Parokya was now named as the newest celebrity music star inductee in the 2017 Eastwood City Walk of Fame in Eastwood City Mall Quezon City for their influence in Pinoy rock music. Parokya was the 3rd related music group and 1st OPM Rock band to be inducted to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame. Parokya Ni Edgar also recently celebrated their 25th silver anniversary last October 2018 following with more concerts and more new gigs to come. A musical adaptation of Parokya Ni Edgar's discography in cooperation with longest running gag comedy show Bubble Gang entitled Bubble Gang Parokya Na To: A Laugh Story The Musical was recently performed last February 15, 2019 at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City, produced by GMA Kapuso Concerts. This was Parokyas 1st musical stage play and also the 4th OPM music artist overall for musical staging play after Eraserheads \"Ang Huling El Bimbo\" in 2015, Apo Hiking Society's \"Eto Na: Musical nAPO\" in 2017,and Aegis \"Rak Of Aegis: The Musical\" in 2018. The band also performed for their 25th silver anniversary concert in the U.S. & Canada Tour entitled Parokya 25 Live In The U.S. & Canada last March 2019. As of this 2020, Parokya is still active with more concerts and is scheduled to release their new single together with the band Kamikazee. == Activism == Parokya joined PETA's Free Mali campaign in 2013. \"Mali has been sentenced to a miserable life of solitary confinement with absolutely nothing to do day after day, year after year,' says lead vocalist Chito Miranda. 'Scientists, politicians, religious leaders, and tens of thousands of other concerned people have joined PETA in calling for Mali to be freed. We in Parokya ni Edgar do, too. Even if the elephant exhibit at the Manila Zoo were to be doubled or tripled in size, it would still not be adequate to house one elephant, never mind additional ones. While zoos around the world have spent upwards of 2 billion pesos on attempts at more appropriately sized elephant exhibits, more and more zoos have recognized that the needs of these complex and intelligent animals cannot be met in captivity. ==Band members== ;Current members *Chito Miranda \u2013 lead vocals (1993\u2013present) *Buwi Meneses \u2013 bass guitar (1993\u2013present) *Darius Sema\u00f1a \u2013 lead guitar (1993\u2013present) *Gab Chee Kee \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals (1993\u2013present) *Dindin Moreno \u2013 drums (1993\u2013present) *Vinci Montaner \u2013 backup vocals, monologue, live vocal ad-libs, occasional percussion (1993\u20132012, 2016\u2013present; on hiatus) ;Touring and session members *Paolo Bernaldo (of Moonstar 88) \u2013 bass guitar (2015\u2013present) ==Discography== ===Albums=== ====Studio albums==== * Khangkhungkherrnitz (1996) * Buruguduystunstugudunstuy (1997) * Gulong Itlog Gulong (1999) * Edgar, Edgar Musikahan (2002) * Bigotilyo (2003) * Halina Sa Parokya (2005) * Solid (2007) * Middle-Aged Juvenile Novelty Pop Rockers (2010) * Pogi Years Old (2016) ====Christmas albums==== * Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow (1998) ====Compilation albums==== * Matira Matibay: PG-13 (Singles 1994-2007) (2007) * Bente (2013) ====Live albums==== * Inuman Sessions Vol. 1 (2004) * Inuman Sessions Vol. 2 (2012) ===DVDs=== * Inuman Sessions VOL.1 DVD (2004) * Matira Matibay: PG-13 (\"Singles 1994-2007\") DVD (2007) * Inuman Sessions VOL.2 DVD (2012) * Bente: Parokya Ni Edgar 20th Anniversary DVD (2013) ===Collaborative album appearances=== * Akustic Natin (Universal Records, 2004) * Akustic Natin Vol. 2 (Universal Records, 2004) * The Best of OPM Acoustic Hits (Universal Records, 2005) * The Best of OPM Love Ballads (Universal Records, 2005) * Pinoy Ako (Star Music, 2005) * OPM Superstars Christmas (Universal Records, 2005) * Superbands (Universal Records, 2005) * Kami nAPO muna (Universal Records, 2006) * OPM Gold Christmas Album (Universal Records, 2006) * The Biggest OPM Hits of The Year SUPER (Universal Records, 2006) * Bandang Pinoy, Lasang Hotdog (Sony Music Philippines, Repackaged 2006) * Kami nAPO muna ulit (Universal Records, 2007) * Pinoy Biggie Hits Rewind (Star Music, 2007) * Level Up: The Album (Star Music, 2007) * OPM Platinum Christmas (Universal Records, 2007) * Another Biggest OPM Hits of The Year SUPER 2 (Universal Records, 2007) * Pinoy Biggie Hits Vol. 3 (Star Music, 2007) * Astig...The Biggest Band Hits (Universal Records, 2008) * Harana: OPM's Biggest Hits In Guitar (Ivory Music, 2009) * I-Star 15: The Best Of Alternative & Rock Songs (Star Music, 2010) * OPM All Star Christmas (Universal Records, 2010) * A Perfectly Acoustic Experience (PolyEast Records, 2011) * Awit Kapuso: Kay Sarap Maging Kapuso (GMA Music, 2012) * Super Astig Hits (Universal Records, 2016) ===Singles=== * 1996: \"Buloy\" * 1996: \"Lutong Bahay (Cooking ng Ina Mo)\" * 1996: \"Tatlong Araw\" * 1996: \"Maniwala Ka Sana\" * 1997: \"Silvertoes\" * 1997: \"Sayang\" * 1997: \"Harana\" (Original composed and song by former Smokey Mountain frontman now Finance Undersecretary Tony Lambino.) * 1999: \"Picha Pie\" * 1999: \"Halaga\" * 1999: \"Inuman Na\" *1999: \"Oka Tokat\" * 1999: \"Wag Mo Na Sana\" (originally composed and performed by Frasco as \"Oo Na Mahal Na Kung Mahal Kita\") * 2002: \"Swimming Beach\" * 2002: \"Sorry Na\" * 2002: \"This Guy's in Love with You Pare\" (a song of Himig Handog 2002) * 2002: \"Beh!
