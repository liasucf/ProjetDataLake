    "text": "Maria Anna of Bavaria (21 March 1551, Munich - 29 April 1608, Graz)Maria von Wittelsbach was a politically active Archduchess of Austria by marriage to Archduke Charles II of Austria. She played an important role in the counter reformation in Austria. ==Life== Maria Anna was the daughter of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria and Anna of Austria. She was given an elementary education in Latin and religion, but a high education in music, likely by Orlando di Lasso. On 26 August 1571 in Vienna, Maria Anna married her maternal uncle, Charles II of Austria. The marriage was arranged to give Charles political support from Bavaria, and Bavaria an agent in Vienna. The relation between Maria Anna and Charles are described as good. Maria Anna was described as confident, ambitious and a great lover of pomp and power, but foremost as a devoted Catholic. She participated in the affairs of state, and successfully benefited a powerful counter reformation in the domains of her spouse. She continued her education in music, benefited the Jesuit school in Graz, and spent her time in religious worship and religious charity. Maria Anna was widowed in 1590. She continued to participate in politics as the adviser of her son and encouraged him to continue the counter reformation and work against the Protestant clergy and nobility. In 1608, she retired to the Nunnery of St Clare in Graz. Her correspondence is partially preserved. ==Issue== * Ferdinand (b. Judenburg, 15 July 1572 \u2013 d. Judenburg, 3 August 1572). * Anne (b.
