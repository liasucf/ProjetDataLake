    "text": "\"Eve of Destruction\" is a protest song written by P. F. Sloan in mid-1964. Several artists have recorded it, but the best-known recording was by Barry McGuire. The song references social issues of its period, including the Vietnam War, the draft, the threat of nuclear war, the Civil Rights Movement, turmoil in the Middle East, and the American space program. The American media helped popularize the song by using it as an example of everything that was wrong with the youth of that time. Due to its controversial lyrics, some American radio stations, \"claiming it was an aid to the enemy in Vietnam\", banned the song.Blecha, Peter; Taboo Tunes/A History of Banned Bands & Censored Songs; Backbeat Books, 2004. The song was also criticized by conservatives. It was also banned by some British radio stations. ==Background== The song had initially been presented to The Byrds as a Dylanesque potential single, but they rejected it. The Turtles, another L.A. group which often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as a track on their 1965 debut album It Ain't Me Babe, shortly before McGuire's version was cut; it was eventually released as a single and hit #100 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1970. ==Lyrical references== * \"You\u2019re old enough to kill, but not for votin'\" refers to the United States law requiring registration for the draft at age 18, while the minimum voting age (in all but four states) was 21, until a Constitutional amendment changed it to 18 in July, 1971. * \"And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'\" refers to The War over Water. * \"If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away.\" Refers to the threat of a nuclear war at any moment, and the damage that this would cause. * The song's mention of Selma, Alabama pertains to the Selma to Montgomery marches and \"Bloody Sunday\" in March 1965. (The Jan and Dean version substitutes \"Watts, California\" in the lyrics, in apparent reference to the Watts riots.) * \"You may leave here for four days in space, but when you return it's the same old place\" refers to the June 1965 mission of Gemini 4, which lasted just over four days. * The lyric \"The pounding of the drums, the pride and disgrace\" refers to the November 1963 John F. Kennedy assassination and his funeral, which featured muffled drumming as the casket was slowly taken to Arlington National Cemetery. == Barry McGuire version == McGuire's recording was made between July 12 and July 15, 1965, and released by Dunhill Records. The accompanying musicians were top-tier Los Angeles session players: P. F. Sloan on guitar, Hal Blaine (of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew) on drums, and Larry Knechtel on bass guitar. The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the recording \"leaked\" out to a disc jockey, who began playing it. The song was an instant hit, and as a result, the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded. McGuire recalled in later years that \"Eve of Destruction\" had been recorded in one take on a Thursday morning, reading lyrics scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. The following Monday morning he got a phone call from the record company at 7:00 am, telling him to turn on the radio \u2014 his song was playing.McGuire stated this on Spicks and Specks, Australian ABC TV shown on March 12, 2008. McGuire's single hit #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1965. After becoming a born-again Christian, McGuire re-recorded \"Eve of Destruction\" as the lead track on his second contemporary Christian release: \"Lighten Up\". He updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line about the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches replaced by the words \"Columbine, Colorado\", referring to the student massacre of 1999. On March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show Spicks and Specks, performing an updated version of \"Eve of Destruction\", with new lines such as \"You're old enough to kill/you just started voting\" and \"...can live for ten years in space\". The reference to \"Red China\" was also removed, and in its place were the more generic \"Now think of all the hate, still living inside us/it's never too late, to let love guide us\". ===Reception=== In the first week of its release, the single was at No. 103 on the Billboard charts. By August 12 Dunhill released the LP, Eve of Destruction. It reached its peak of #37 on the Billboard album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to #1 on the chart, and repeated the feat on the Cashbox chart, where it had debuted at No. 30. McGuire would never again break into the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. It went to #1 in Norway for two weeks. ===Chart history=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1965) !Peak position |- |Belgium | style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Germany | style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 |- | |- |Netherlands | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Norway | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |UK (OCC) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|1 |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1965) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |US Billboard Hot 100Musicoutfitters.com | style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |- |US Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 |- |} === Controversy, parodies, and response songs === In addition to its being banned in some parts of the U.S., it was also banned by Radio Scotland.Chapman, Robert;Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio; Routledge, 1992.

The song briefly appeared in Stephen King's 1994 miniseries The Stand. With a burning Des Moines, Iowa, as a backdrop, Larry Underwood sits atop the hood of a car, belting out the song to amuse himself until interrupted by another survivor of the superflu. It also appeared in The Simpsons episode GABF16, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\", and was featured in Michael Winterbottom's 1997 film Welcome to Sarajevo. A Joey Scarbury cover was played repeatedly in the original airing of The Greatest American Hero episode \"Operation Spoil Sport,\" to encourage the hero to prevent an automated nuclear strike being triggered by a renegade U.S. general (the aliens who provided the hero's super-powers commandeered his car radio and tuned it to stations playing the song). Due to copyright issues, the song does not appear in the DVD version of the episode. A French translation is used in the closing credits of Michael Moore's film Sicko. \"Eve of Destruction\" also makes an appearance in The Doors (directed by Oliver Stone), as the opening act performs it before The Doors take the stage in Miami. The song is played during the fourth-season finale of The A-Team, \"The Sound of Thunder,\" when the team returns to Vietnam and flashbacks recall their tours of duty. The song, like many other popular songs of the day, gave its name to a gun truck used by United States Army Transportation Corps forces during the Vietnam War. The truck is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum and is believed to be the only surviving example of a Vietnam era gun truck. The song is featured in the soundtrack of Mafia III. * The song is referenced in the July 19, 1991 strip for Big Nate. ==See also== *Civil rights movement in popular culture *List of anti-war songs ==References== ==External links== *MerseySide itunes link *Barry McGuire Homepage * Category:1965 singles Category:1965 songs Category:Anti-war songs Category:Barry McGuire songs Category:The Screaming Jets songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Jan and Dean songs Category:Number-one singles in Norway Category:Protest songs Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Song recordings produced by Lou Adler Category:Songs about nuclear war and weapons Category:Songs against racism and xenophobia Category:Songs of the Vietnam War Category:Songs written by P.
