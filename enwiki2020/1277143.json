Upper Black Eddy is officially part of Bridgeton Township which also borders the adjacent Borough of Milford, Hunterdon County, New Jersey via the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission's free Upper Black Eddy- Milford Bridge over the Delaware River. ==History== Upper Black Eddy originates from the Black family who operated a hotel at this point of Delaware River and did share part of its unique name with the former village of (Lower Black Eddy) now known as Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania. The village's growth in the early 19th century was due to the opening of the Pennsylvania Canal passing through the village as a result canal-related businesses sprang up quickly, including a shipyard, mule stables, general store and several hotels; the most notable was the Upper Black Eddy Inn. This was later transformed into Chef Tell's Manor House, which closed in 2004 and demolished in 2010. The Upper Black Eddy portion of the Pennsylvania Canal was also known as \"Candy Bend\". Origins of that name are unknown but local lore suggests that the Upper Black Eddy Inn also operated as a brothel, and a popular stop for \"candy\" - a slang term of the time for a prostitute. There is no conclusive evidence to validate this local lore. Upper Black Eddy has two notable geographic features: 1: Ringing Rocks Park. This is a 4-acre (16,000 m\u00b2) boulder field of weathered Diabase rocks, some of which \"ring\" much like a bell when struck with a hammer. This park also includes Buck County's highest waterfall situated on High Rocks Creek. 2: Nockamixon Cliffs. 400 foot shale cliffs overlooking the Delaware River is located within the Delaware Canal State Park. ==Businesses== Homestead General Store, the oldest continually operating general store on the Delaware Canal is located in Upper Black Eddy along with Homestead Coffee Roasters, an artisan coffee roaster specializing in organic and fair trade coffee. The Bridgeton House on the Delaware, a B&B; inn, which opened in 1981, continues the tradition of lodging on the Delaware. Upper Black Eddy was supposedly a favored vacation spot for President Grover Cleveland due to his love for fishing. The Narrows Restaurant opened on River Road in April 2019.
