Quick Six continues a Stampeders tradition, which began in 1993, of having a horse charge down the east sidelines of a field, after Calgary scores a touchdown. Out of the nine current CFL teams, only one has replaced their mascot, the Toronto Argonauts. Prior to Jason, the Argonauts had a mascot named \"Scully,\" who was \"traded\" by the team, for Jason, in 2003. Jason was later, \"promoted to starting mascot,\" in 2005.http://www.argonauts.ca/jason-the-mascot/ The now defunct franchise, the Ottawa Renegades' mascot was Ruffy the Beaver. ==References== Category:Canadian Football League mascots Category:Lists of mascots ",
