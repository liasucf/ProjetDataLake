    "text": "Barron Gorge is a locality in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. == Geography == Kuranda Scenic Railway tourist train, 2004 Almost the entire area of the locality is undeveloped land within the Barron Gorge National Park which also extends into a number of neighbouring localities. The land rises from approximately 10 metres above sea level to the east of the locality up to such as Red Peak (590 metres above sea level in the north of the locality), North Peak (730 metres in the middle of the locality), and Mount Williams (also known as Tokim Peak, 1010 metres in the south of the locality). The name of the locality derives from the gorge created by Barron River through the Great Dividing Range. The Cairns-to-Kuranda railway line provides the north- western boundary of the locality and also part of the south-eastern locality. The railway line is used by the Kuranda Scenic Railway tourist service which includes stops at scenic lookouts. There is only one road through the locality, the Barron Gorge Road, which starts in Carvonica and Kamerunga and provides access to the Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station. == References == == External links == Category:Cairns Region Category:Localities in Queensland ",
