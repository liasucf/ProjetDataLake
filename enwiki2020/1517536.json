He served as Prime Minister between 1 and 16 November 1918 and as President between 16 November 1918 and 21 March 1919. ==Early life and career== Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in Franzensbad around 1887. ===Early life=== The K\u00e1rolyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was born on March 4, 1875, in the K\u00e1rolyi Palace in the aristocratic palace district of Pest. K\u00e1rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: Cleft lip and cleft palate, and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih\u00e1ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. He was teased and humiliated during his childhood, despite the power and wealth of his family, which influenced his subsequent vanity, ambition and desire for power. Mih\u00e1ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother. He was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F\u00f3t, because Count Julius K\u00e1rolyi, the politician father had not enough time for Mih\u00e1ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih\u00e1ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was lower in a comparison with other members of the higher aristocracy. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty, the traditional anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi, his adoration of the 1848 revolution in Hungary, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop\u00e9die and Jules Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of social justice, unbroken optimistic faith in the fast development of science and technology, which will solve all problems of humankind. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. Nevertheless, he obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. Francophone as was traditional in the family, he spent several years in Paris; he also traveled across the United Kingdom and the United States. Mih\u00e1ly became a passionate collector of racecars and yachts. As a gambling addict, he was known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \"dandy\" lifestyle in famous casinos across Western Europe. The young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.

In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, K\u00e1rolyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. In 1910, K\u00e1rolyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence. Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi became implacable political enemies since the 1905 elections. Their debates in the parliament further increased their personal mutual antagonism by time. In January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by prime minister Istv\u00e1n Tisza, after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement. The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut K\u00e1rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel. === World War I, political campaign for the Allied Powers === On August 5, when the war broke out, his ship has arrived to Le Havre, he has come back from his long trip from the United States. He was shortly arrested, as a citizen of an enemy country, despite Austria-Hungary was not at war with the French Republic yet, thus he was released from the prison. Later, he was arrested again for several weeks in Bordeaux for being a citizen of an enemy country. After K\u00e1rolyi promised that he won't fight against the French during the war, the French authorities allowed him to return to Hungary via Switzerland. During the First World War, the pro-Entente K\u00e1rolyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. K\u00e1rolyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war. The K\u00e1rolyi Party was always a weak group with no mass organization and only 20 members in Parliament, most of whom had little commitment to the party. K\u00e1rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K\u00e1rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza. In 1916 K\u00e1rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K\u00e1rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the K\u00e1rolyi Party. In January 1918, K\u00e1rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. == Marriage and family == On 7 November 1914 in Budapest, K\u00e1rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy de Cs\u00edkszentkir\u00e1ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K\u00e1rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K\u00e1rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law. ==Leading the Democratic Republic== President Mihaly Karolyi's speech after the proclamation of the First Hungarian Republic on 16 november, 1918 B\u00e9la Linder's pacifist speech for military officers, and declaration of Hungarian self-disarmament on 2 November, 1918. Following the Aster Revolution of October 1918, K\u00e1rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K\u00e1rolyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited. King-Emperor Charles IV designated him as prime minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the Habsburgs. K\u00e1rolyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to Austria if possible. Only after Charles's withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918 made K\u00e1rolyi proclaim the Hungarian Democratic Republic, with himself as provisional president. On 11 January 1919 the National Council formally recognized him as president. The Hungarian Royal Honv\u00e9d army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. K\u00e1rolyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of B\u00e9la Linder, (minister of war) on 2 November, 1918.Dixon J. C. Defeat and Disarmament, Allied Diplomacy and Politics of Military Affairs in Austria, 1918\u20131922. Associated University Presses 1986. p. 34.Sharp A. The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919\u20131923. Palgrave Macmillan 2008. p. 156\\. . Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco- Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411 km\u00b2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. Military and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary. On 13 November, K\u00e1rolyi signed the Armistice of Belgrade with the Allied nations. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.Krizman B. The Belgrade Armistice of 13 November 1918 in The Slavonic and East European Review January 1970, 48:110. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made. The lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of Upper Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Maros (Mure\u0219) . However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied P\u00e9cs.Breit J. Hungarian Revolutionary Movements of 1918\u201319 and the History of the Red War in Main Events of the K\u00e1rolyi Era Budapest 1929. pp. 115\u2013116. Many citizens thought that K\u00e1rolyi could negotiate soft peace terms with the Allies for Hungary. K\u00e1rolyi headed the Provisional Government from 1 November 1918 until 16 November, when the Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed. K\u00e1rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large Hungarian Social Democratic Party and the small Civic Radical Party led by Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi. At the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the Soviets (Councils) that existed in Russia in 1917. This situation of Dual Power gave K\u00e1rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility. Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in a speech During their brief periods in power, K\u00e1rolyi and J\u00e1szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic. Additional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. Austria-Hungary had signed the lenient Armistice of villa Giusti (close to Padua, Italy) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice. Against his better judgement, K\u00e1rolyi agreed to this idea, and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in Belgrade with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General Louis Franchet d'Esperey. General Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had. This was the source of much criticism of K\u00e1rolyi, who had been expected \u2013 and who himself expected \u2013 the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy. Moreover, K\u00e1rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K\u00e1rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation. Furthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K\u00e1rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions. K\u00e1rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants. To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. K\u00e1rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants in K\u00e1polna on 23 february, 1919 In another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K\u00e1rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918. All through the winter of 1918\u201319, the Romanians, the Yugoslavs and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K\u00e1rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself. In addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore, the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from Transylvania and Galicia. Making things worse was the creation of Czechoslovakia which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German coal. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918\u201319, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass unemployment. Making things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive inflation and even more impoverishment. K\u00e1rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K\u00e1rolyi. Baron Lajos Hatvany described K\u00e1rolyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions \u2013 no actions. A cabinet? No, it was a debating club\".Vermes, Gabor \"The October Revolution In Hungary\" from Hungary in Revolution edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971 page 49. In the same vein, the British writer Harold Nicolson, who had known K\u00e1rolyi during his exile in Britain, when reviewing K\u00e1rolyi's memoirs in 1957 noted that: \"he had many qualities, but unfortunately lacked those for which a man is taken seriously by serious people\".Menczer, Bela \"Bela Kun and the Hungarian Revolution of 1919\" pages 299\u2013309 Volume XIX, Issue #5, May 1969, History Today Inc: London page 301. Sigmund Freud, the Austrian psychologist--who had known the two politicians personally--wrote about the assassination of Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the appointment of Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi as new prime minister of Hungary: On 20 March 1919 the French presented the Vix Note ordering Hungarian troops further back into Hungary; it was widely assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers. K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister D\u00e9nes Berinkey were now in an untenable position. Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either. On 21 March, Berinkey resigned. K\u00e1rolyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government. Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by B\u00e9la Kun. Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced K\u00e1rolyi's resignation and the formation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At that point, K\u00e1rolyi accepted the fait accompli and retired from active politics. ===K\u00e1rolyi's cabinet=== *Minister of Agriculture: Barna Buza *Minister of Commerce: Ern\u0151 Garami *Minister of Defense: B\u00e9la Linder (31 October 1918 to 9 November 1918); Albert Bartha (9 November 1918 to 12 December 1918; Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi (12 December 1918 to 29 December 1918; S\u00e1ndor Festetics (29 December 1918 to 19 January 1919) *Minister of Finance: Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi (31 October 1918 to 25 November 1918; P\u00e1l Szende (25 November 1918 to 19 January 1919) *Minister of Food: Ferenc Nagy *Minister of the Interior: Tivadar Batthy\u00e1ny (31 October 1918 to 12 December 1918; Vince Nagy (12 December 1918 to 19 January 1919) *Minister of Justice: Barna Buza (31 October 1918 to 3 November 1918; D\u00e9nes Berinkey (3 November 1918 to 19 January 1919) *King's Personal Minister: Tivadar Batthy\u00e1ny (31 October 1918 to 1 November 1918) *Minister of Religion and Education: M\u00e1rton Lov\u00e1szy (31 October 1918 to 23 December 1918) *Minister of Welfare and Labour: Zsigmond Kunfi (12 December 1918 to 19 January 1919) *Minister Without Portfolio: Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi (31 October 1918 to 1 November 1918); Zsigmond Kunfi (31 October 1918 to 12 November 1918); B\u00e9la Linder (9 November 1918 to 12 December 1918) *Minister Without Portfolio for Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia: Zsigmond Kunfi (6 November 1918 to 19 January 1919) *Minister Without Portfolio for Nationalities: Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi (1 November 1918 to 19 January 1919) ==Later life== K\u00e1rolyi in 1948 On 10 April 1919, \"Romanian troops began to invade Hungary to forestall reconquest of Transylvania. A provisional government was set up by Count Julius Karolyi (brother of Michael), Count Istv\u00e1n Bethlen, Admiral Horthy, and Archduke Joseph at Szeged (under French occupation).\"Penfield Roberts, \"Hungary\", in William L. Langer (1948), ed., An Encyclopedia of History, Rev. Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 1014. In July 1919, K\u00e1rolyi went into exile in France and during World War Two, in Britain. Throughout the Horthy era, K\u00e1rolyi was in a state of official disgrace in his homeland. In 1924, while K\u00e1rolyi's wife was in the United States she came down with typhoid fever. K\u00e1rolyi applied for a visa to come to the United States to visit her, but the State Department imposed a gag order, preventing him from giving any political speeches, as the State Department believed him to be a Communist. A year later, Countess K\u00e1rolyi was denied a visa to visit the United States, but Secretary Kellogg of the State Department refused to explain on what grounds her visa denial was made. THE CABINET: Law and Discretion, Time, Monday, Nov. 02, 1925 Morris Ernst acted as K\u00e1rolyi's lawyer for these issues. In 1946, K\u00e1rolyi, who by that time had become a socialist, returned to Hungary and from 1947\u201349 served as the Hungarian Ambassador to France. In 1949, he resigned in protest over the show trial and execution of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk. He wrote two volumes of memoirs in exile; Egy eg\u00e9sz vil\u00e1g ellen (\"Against the Entire World\") in 1925 and Memoirs: Faith without Illusion in 1954. He died in Vence, France, on 19 March 1955 at the age of 80. ==Legacy== K\u00e1rolyi's statue where it stood on Lajos Kossuth Square, Budapest In 1975, a memorial to K\u00e1rolyi, sculpted by Imre Varga, was installed in Budapest's Kossuth Lajos t\u00e9r. In 2012, the government began renovation to the square to the way it looked before World War II, and K\u00e1rolyi's statue was moved to Si\u00f3fok.Taking a stand on Kossuth square , Budapest Times At the same time, throughout Hungary, many cities changed the name of their own streets named after Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi. In Budapest for example the name of the prominent street in downtown, was changed from \"K\u00e1rolyi Mih\u00e1ly utca\" to simply \"K\u00e1rolyi utca\", removing the association with him. ==Footnotes== ==References and further reading== * Deak, Istvan. \"Budapest and the Hungarian Revolutions of 1918-1919.\" Slavonic and East European Review 46.106 (1968): 129-140. online *Deak, Istvan \"The Decline and Fall of Habsburg Hungary, 1914\u201318\" pages 10\u201330 from Hungary in Revolution edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971. * Hajdu, Tibor. \"Michael K\u00e1rolyi and the Revolutions of 1918\u201319.\" Acta Historica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 10.3/4 (1964): 351-371. online * K\u00e1rolyi, Mih\u00e1ly.
