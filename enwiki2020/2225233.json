Tecmo World Cup Soccer is not to be confused with Nintendo World Cup of the same year,http://www.gamespot.com/nes/sports/worldcupsoccer/index.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 nor Tecmo Cup Soccer Game released in September 1992,http://www.gamespot.com/nes/sports/captaintsubasa/index.html?tag=similargames%3Bimg%3B1 is a port of Tehkan World Cup adapted to the NES hardware. Although the two games appear virtually identical, Tecmo World Cup Soccer lacks some of the speed and fluidity of its arcade progenitor. While the gameplay is ostensibly unchanged, the lack of support for analog control in the NES version renders it a digital-control-only game that requires almost completely different tactics. ==World Cup Teams== The national teams in Tecmo World Cup Soccer are as follows (in order, they are available to choose in game \"Team Select\" menu): * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Similarities to Tehkan World Cup== Tecmo World Cup Soccer, released five years after its arcade ancestor, is a direct conversion of Tehkan World Cup squeezed with some concessions into the smaller NES hardware. These are the principle similarities: *the same musical score (albeit adapted to the NES sound hardware) *nearly identical gameplay, although significantly hampered by the absence of analog control *almost identical graphics, partially simplified and slowed down ==Differences to Tehkan World Cup== As Tehkan World Cup utilized two processors for gameplay and four processors for sound, certain concessions were made to playability on the NES. While the gameplay and graphics remained largely unaltered, certain features were omitted. In recognition of its new home system format, some arcade elements such as the instant knockout format were abandoned in order to provide greater longevity. A partial list of difference is below: *A choice of teams was now available *Competition format *Game lengths *On-screen \"scoreboard\" (includes large font game clock and score) omitted *Field radar showing player positions omitted *The \"grass\" had a simpler, more unified texture *Players do not celebrate during the goal sequence *The goal net is shown to bulge upon receipt of the ball *Slide tackles can be initiated by the player *The ball could bounce after a high kick *The ball rebounded from the net and goalposts in a slightly different manner ==See also== *Tehkan World Cup *Tecmo Cup Football Game ==References== ==External links== * Tecmo World Cup Soccer tournaments on VK.com * Clip of Tecmo World Cup Soccer on youtube Category:1990 video games Category:Association football video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Tecmo games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
