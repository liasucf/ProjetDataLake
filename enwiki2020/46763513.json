Gentleman and Lady in a Bedroom. To the right a lady in bed converses with her husband who is sitting in his night-gown on a chair, pulling on his stockings. A fur-trimmed cape and a hat lie near him on a table covered with a cloth. In the foreground a comely servant-girl stands, holding with both hands a dish and a mug. An open door looks into another room ; the sun shines on the wall. Canvas, 22 inches by 27 inches. Sale. Aron de Joseph de Pinto, in Amsterdam, April n, 1785, No. 2.\"entry 80 for Gentleman and Lady in a Bedroom in Hofstede de Groot, 1908 == History == According to the MET's museum website, the painting has been cut down to remove a woman lying in bed, and the man next to the bed was previously painted over.
