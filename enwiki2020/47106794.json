Its various offices can be accessed through its website. These are the Pope's website and other offices such as Vatican News on internet (including the former Vatican Media Center which distributes segments for television), the Holy See Press Office, L'Osservatore Romano, Photograph Service, Vatican Radio, , and the Vatican Publishing House. The Pontifical Council for Social Communications has been subsumed into this new Dicastery. Pope Francis established the Secretariat for Communication in June 2015, with Monsignor Dario Edoardo Vigan\u00f2, former director of the Vatican Television Center, as its first prefect.
