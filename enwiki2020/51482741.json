He aims to capture the essence of the outside world in his music by using different field recordings to do so. He's slept in the Sahara desert, been chased by bears, hung out in the Amazon for a bit and climbed some of the world's tallest mountains alongside his trusty recorder while he does so to capture the sounds of those different landscapes. The sound ends up being reminiscent of Sigur Ros, Olafur Arnalds, or Explosions in the Sky, and it's absolutely stunning.\" On June 22, he released a full-length album entitled \"Elements.\" This music originated as the soundtrack for Tony's G's series with Udaya.com.
