If it could pick one plot point and work with it, Good Luck would be a much stronger manhwa.\" \u2014 Nadia Oxford, Mania. \"It's a refreshing change of pace from what we're used to seeing in the shojo titles we've been offered lately.\" \u2014 A. E. Sparrow, IGN. \"Good Luck by E-Jin Kang is a romance and drama manhwa (Korean comics), or better yet, a romantic, teen melodrama.\" \u2014 Leroy Douresseaux, Comic Book Bin. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manhwa titles Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Romance comics Category:Sh\u014djo manga Category:Daewon C.I. titles ",
