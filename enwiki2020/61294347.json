Sweden could win only the home game against Ireland, also played two draws and lost the last decisive match for the group victory in the Netherlands. In second place they scored in the first quarter-final on Denmark and won in Odense with 5: 1. This was enough to make it 1-1 in the second leg to reach the finals.

In the small final Sweden then secured by a 2: 1 victory after extra time against Italy in third place. ==Euro 1991== In qualifying for the following European Championship finals, the Swedes met France and Poland. Sweden won the four games and conceded only in the two 4: 1 home victories goals. In the quarter- finals Italy were the opponents and after a 1-1 in Malm\u00f6 it was enough in Castellammare only to a goalless draw. This was the departure of Sweden on the basis of the away goals rule. As the best quarter-final losers, the Swedes qualified for the first 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup in China. ==Euro 1993== 23 teams took part in the qualification for the following European Championship. In order to qualify for the quarter-finals Sweden had to play again in the group stage against Ireland and for the first time Spain, against which the qualification began with a 4-0 victory.

In the quarterfinals then the Danes were the opponents. First they lost 2-1 at home Bor\u00e5s and then only 1-1 in the second leg. Sweden was not qualified for the top four again. ==Euro 1995== Just nine months after the quarter-finals began with 29 teams qualifying for the next European Championship, which was held again and for the last time without a final round. Sweden first met Latvia and the Slovakia, which participated for the first time. With four wins without conceding Sweden was group winner again.

By a 3-0 in the second leg Sweden could qualify for the semi-finals, which was played as in 1984 with a return match. Opponent was Norway, who won at home 4: 3. With a 4: 1 win in the second leg, the Swedes could make up for this defeat and move into the final. This took place in a game in Germany.

Due to the different skill level of the teams announced the qualification was divided into two categories. The 16 strongest teams, which also included Sweden, played for the direct qualification to play the 18 weaker teams for the possibility of the next qualification in the higher category. In the first match Sweden once again met Denmark and won there 2-1. Sweden then met Romania for the first time and won 8-0. Against the third opponent Spain, there was the only point loss in the home game 1-1, but the other three games were won, and a a. 8-0 in Spain, which is still the highest defeat for Spain.

With a 3-0 win over France Sweden then closed the group stage and met in the semifinals on defending Germany. In a long open game, Bettina Wiegmann could score the only goal in the 84th minute. Germany could then defend the title in the final against Italy. ==Euro 2001== In qualifying for the 2001 European Championships, the Swedes played again in the higher category and met three old acquaintances: France, Spain and the Netherlands.

Two years later, both stood in the World Cup final again and again won the Germans by a golden goal. ==Euro 2005== For the European Championship 2005, the host was first determined in advance and England was awarded the contract for the host. In category A this time 20 teams played in four groups of five and Sweden met Italy, Finland, Switzerland and for the first time Serbia and Montenegro.

Italy in second and Finland in third could then qualify in the playoffs as well. In the final round, Sweden met Denmark in the first game and both drew 1-1. Also against qualifying opponents Finland it was enough only to a draw, this time without goals. Thus, Sweden was only in third place before the last game against hosts England and needed a victory to progress. This secured Anna Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m through the only goal of the game in the third minute and as the Finns surprisingly won against Denmark in the parallel match, Sweden was even group winner. In the semi-final against Norway, it was dramatic, because twice Hanna Ljungberg could compensate for a Norwegian lead, with one last minute before the end of the game. This was followed by an extra-time, in which Solveig Gulbrandsen secured the final for Norway with her second goal. There, the Norwegians lost but once again against Germany.

With eight goals, Victoria Sandell Svensson was the best Swedish and sixth overall top scorer in qualifying. In the final round, the Swedes met Russia in the first game and won 3-0. The second game was followed by a 2-0 win over Italy. Thus, the Swedes needed from the last game against England only one point to become group winners and England was enough to reach a point as the best group Knights also the knockout round. And so both parted with 1: 1. In the quarterfinals, the Swedes were then favored against Norway, but lost with 1: 3. ==Euro 2013== For the EURO 2013, Sweden and the Netherlands had applied as hosts and Sweden was awarded the contract, making it the second time in Sweden that Sweden did not qualify.
