    "text": "Eidgen\u00f6ssische Sammlung (German; literally \"Confederate Collection\") was a Swiss political party, founded in 1940 by Robert Tobler as a successor to the recently dissolved National Front.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 391 The party demanded an adjustment in Swiss policy to favour the Axis powers. This was particularly important as, after June 1940 the country was surrounded by fascist and Nazi states. It was open in its loyalty towards Nazi Germany.Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bergier, Unabh\u00e4ngige Expertenkommission Schweiz--Zweiter Weltkrieg, Switzerland, National Socialism, and the Second World War: final report, Berghahn Books, 2002, p. 395 The Eidgen\u00f6ssiche Sammlung was closely supervised by the state because of its origins and so could not develop freely. In 1943 the police finally cracked down on the group and it was outlawed along with all of its sub- organisations as part of a wider government initiative against the National Front and its offshoots. ==References== Category:Defunct political parties in Switzerland Category:Nazi parties Category:Political parties established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in Switzerland Category:Political parties disestablished in 1943 ",
