    "text": "The Chansons gaillardes (Ribald songs) FP 42, are a song cycle of eight pieces composed by Francis Poulenc in 1925\u20131926 \"In euphoria and post-war\"Guide de la m\u00e9lodie et du lied, p. 497 on anonymous texts of the 17th century. The work was dedicated to Mme Fernand Allard. This cycle was premiered in concert on 2 May 1926, salle des Agriculteurs8 in the 9th arrondissement of Paris,Correspondance 1910-1963, p. 269 by Pierre Bernac, as a 26-year-old baritone virtually unknown, and Francis Poulenc, 27 years old, as the pianist. It was the memory of this first collaboration that would bring together Poulenc and Bernac several years later for many international tours, from 1934 to 1959. == Composition of the cycle == The titles of the eight pieces, of which the tempi alternate quick and slow movements, are as follow: # La Ma\u00eetresse volage \u2013 Rondement # Chanson \u00e0 boire \u2013 Adagio # Madrigal \u2013 Tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cid\u00e9 # Invocation aux Parques \u2013 Grave # Couplets bachiques \u2013 Tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9 # L'Offrande \u2013 Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 # La Belle Jeunesse \u2013 Tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9 # S\u00e9r\u00e9nade \u2013 Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 == Analysis == Just out of the surrealist experience of Les Six, Poulenc dared to bring the bawdy songs into the concert halls. On the one hand, the text of Les Chansons gaillardes comes from anonymous texts of the seventeenth century, written in a tone of celebration and alcohol: \"texts rather scabrous\",Correspondance 1910-1963, p. 266 according to Francis Poulenc himself. On the other hand, in the Journal de mes m\u00e9lodies, Poulenc explains about them: \"I hold this collection dear where I tried to demonstrate that obscenity can accommodate music. I hate ribaldry\". Most texts imply a particular play on words, a lightness in the form of code. For example, in the Chanson \u00e0 boire, the words celebrate \"the kings of Egypt and Syria\" because they \"wanted their body to be embalmed, to last longer, dead\", and conclude, Buvons donc selon notre envie ! [...] Embaumons-nous ! (Let's therefore drink according to our desire! [...] Let us embalm!\") == References == == Bibliography == *1964: Francis Poulenc, Journal de mes m\u00e9lodies, \u00e9ditions Grasset ; Reissued in 1993, a full text prepared and annotated by Renaud Machart, \u00e9ditions Cic\u00e9ro and \u00c9ditions Durand-Salabert-Eschig, Paris, 1993 ; *2011: Francis Poulenc, J'\u00e9cris ce qui me chante, Texts and interviews presented and annotated by Nicolas Southon, 2011, , 982 p. ; *1994: Francis Poulenc, Correspondance 1910-1963, Collected, selected, presented and annotated by Myriam Chim\u00e8nes, Fayard, , 1128 p. *1994: Brigitte Fran\u00e7ois- Sappey and Gilles Cantagrel (dir.), Guide de la m\u00e9lodie et du lied, Fayard, , 918 p. *1926: Chansons gaillardes, score published by par Heugel & Cie, (ISMN M-047-29356-5) == External links == * Texts of the songs at the LiederNet Archive * Poulenc, Chansons gaillardes : Chanson \u00e0 boire on YouTube * 8 Chansons gaillardes, FP 42 (Poulenc, Francis) on IMSLP * Bilingual texts on Melodie Treasury * Chansons gaillardes, FP42 on Hyperion * Chansons gaillardes on data.bnf.fr Category:Compositions by Francis Poulenc Category:1925 compositions Category:Choral compositions ",
