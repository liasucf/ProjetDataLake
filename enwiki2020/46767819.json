He made the decision because it was closer to his hometown and he was expected to immediately get playing time from coach John T. Reilly.

Mississauga vice president of basketball operations John Wiggins said of his performance: \"What's great about it is it's unbridled, he's just going out there and playing. Imagine what happens when A) he learns (head coach Kyle Julius') systems and the philosophies of what we're trying to do and B) just getting more time with the kid \u2026 By the time the playoffs come, he'll be ready.\" In 18 games, Newby averaged 5.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game and was named to the NBL All-Rookie Team.
