It is named in honor of Isabella I of Castile. Isabela is spread over 13 barrios and Isabela Pueblo, which is the downtown area and administrative center. It is a principal part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==Nicknames== The town is known as the \"Jard\u00edn del Noroeste\", the \"Garden of the Northwest\", because of the many wild flowers in its landscape. It is also known as \"El Pueblo de los Quesitos de Hoja\", the \"Town of Leaf Cheeses,\" for its production of a typical fresh white cheese wrapped in banana plant leaves, reputed to be the best. It is also known as la Ciudad de los Gallitos or the \"City of the Fighting Cocks.\" Since the 18th century, cock fighting was very common throughout the island, and the town became famous and well known for the quality of its fighting cocks and special breeding and training techniques used by its people. == History == === Foundation === The chief Mabodamaca, one of the most important chieftains of the Island of Borinquen (name for the island of Puerto Rico) during the first decades of the 16th century, ruled the region of the 'Guajataca' (Ta\u00edno name for the northwestern region of Puerto Rico) where Isabela was founded. Although the actual date of the origins of the first Spanish settlement is not precisely known, a small settlement/hermitage is known to have existed by the end of the 17th century or beginning of the 18th century in a great extension of land into what encompass today the municipalities of Isabela, Camuy and Quebradillas. The settlement was bordered to the east with the shoreline of the Guajataca River and was located on the grounds of an earlier Ta\u00edno settlement. Around 1725, Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Mendiz\u00e1bal y Azares, Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico granted authorization to base a population on the existing hermitage/village. Its given name, San Antonio de La Tuna, derives from the avocation of the Spanish settlers to the saint San Antonio de Padua and in honor of a wild cactus growing in the region (Tuna is the Spanish name for cactus). At the end of the 18th century San Antonio de la Tuna had a church, more than sixty houses, and almost 1,200 inhabitants, which was a considerable population for those times. === Relocation === Prompted by economic and health factors, the decision to relocate the hermitage to a more favorable location was pursued. Around 1818, the village obtained authorization from then Governor Salvador Mel\u00e9ndez to transfer the population to a new location closer to the coast. Mel\u00e9ndez approved the transfer request and a new town was founded the following year on May 21, 1819. In the same year the construction of the church began, and was finished in 1824. In 1918 the church was damaged during a strong earthquake that affected the western region of the island, it was rebuilt soon after. ===Hurricane Maria=== In September 2017 thousands of people were evacuated from their homes in Isabela when Hurricane Maria caused structural damage to the nearby Guajataca Reservoir. == Demographics == According to the 2010 Census, there were 45,631 people in the city.

Geographically, the municipality of Isabela belongs to the Northern Coastal Plains. Running through the south, the Aymam\u00f3n mountains, a prolongation of the Jaicoa Mountain Range that begins in the neighboring town of Aguadilla, boasts peaks of over above sea level.

The central part of the territory consists mostly of flatlands, the mountains do not surpass 656 feet (200 m) in height and the coastline flats (Bajuras) are slightly above sea level. === Barrios === Subdivisions of Isabela. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Isabela is subdivided into barrios.

A favorite for snorkelers, scuba and free divers and underwater caverns enthusiasts. == Economy == === Agriculture === The early economy of the hermitage had been based mainly on cattle [ranching], its derivative products and hogs products, but trading was limited due to many factors: its inland location and topography. The settlement was posted above a hill overlooking the river (now river Guajataca) which made it difficult to use the river as a trading route, as did the location's propensity to disease and outbreaks. After the transfer to the present Isabela location the economic realities that resulted from the new land and property opportunities that were readily available, the healthier environment formed due to the wide open plains and prevalent northern winds, and the proximity to the coast and the natural sea port at the bay of 'Punta Sardina' prompted for the diversification of the agricultural products and an increase in trade. The cultivation of sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, cotton, Cassava/yuca, coconut and other fruits was stimulated further. Isabela continued to flourish until recent years due to the island's economic crisis, the closing of important factories and the rising crime rate. === Industry === Isabela also has a hi- tech plant, a higher education institution, a world-renowned agricultural research center and a major shopping center, Plaza Isabela. ==Culture== === Festivals and events === Isabela celebrates its patron saint festival in June.

Isabela had a basketball team that played at the Jose \"Buga\" Abreu Coliseum, the Isabela Roosters (\"Gallitos de Isabela\"). The team had average success. In 1987, one of its superstars, Frankie Torruella, was diagnosed with heart disease, and the trading of another star player, Edwin Pellot, to the Coamo team, hastened the team's fallout. In 1984, the team lost the championship, four games to two, to the Canovanas Indians team (\"Indios de Can\u00f3vanas\"). Between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, the Bantams were serious championship contenders. In the late 1970s their star player, Mickey Coll, died in a motorcycle accident. The team's first home court was named after him. The Bantams where Isabela's home team until October 2005 when they moved the franchise to Guaynabo. The Playeras, a female volleyball team, played in Isabela for 2 seasons until they also moved to Aguadilla becoming Las Divas. The Isabela Muscle Cars Club, celebrating annual events since 2002 is a popular event in Isabela. On August 28, 2016 the club celebrated their 15th Anniversary at the Coliseum Jose \"Buga\" Abreu. The town also has its own classic car club, called \"Club de Autos Clasicos y Antiguos del Noroeste\" (Classic and Old Car Club from Northwest). They also celebrate their own Exhibition of Classic Cars at the coliseum in November. The local basketball team was called the \"Gallitos\" (\"Little Cocks,\" in reference to the slim, lightweight body of the fighting variety) due to the town's fame for quality fighting cocks. The name was translated literally into English as \"Bantams\", a variety of dwarf cocks. The town has a cockfighting arena, traditionally called a gallera. Fights were customarily held on Sunday mornings, and the bets and stakes were controlled by the government of Puerto Rico. Prizes were paid based on the fighting record of the cocks. A law prohibiting cockfighting in the U.S. and its territories went into effect in early 2019. Isabela has amateur baseball teams. Also, Isabela is well known for its Fine Step Horses (\"Caballos de Paso Fino\") and its world class board, wind and kite surfing spots. ==Government== Like all municipalities in Puerto Rico, Isabela is administered by a mayor. The current mayor is Carlos Delgado Altieri, from the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Delgado was elected at the 2000 general election.

It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top and bottom stripe are yellow and the center one green. The coat of arms may be superposed on the green stripe in the center. === Coat of arms === The Original Coat of Arms of Isabela The town's coat of arms, dated 1819, is divided an olive tree in its center, symbolizes the first inhabitants of Isabela and of the island of Puerto Rico, the Igneris Indians. The gold represents the Ta\u00edno Indians (they made extensive use of gold), who lived in this area about two hundred years before the discovery of the island. The gold bell represented in the center stripe between two cactus is a symbol of the town of San Antonio de la Tuna. The two cocks represent the bravery of the inhabitants and Isabela's famous fighting cocks. The horse represents the cattle wealth of the region and honors the fine step horses (Paso Fino) for which Isabela is famous. The coat of arms is embellished with a mural crown having three towers, the standard emblem at the time for formally established 'pueblos' (townships) under Spanish rule. A new coat of arms is shown here; it depicts a revised mural crown with five towers to represent a city, but historically, only 11 communities in Puerto Rico were conferred this title under Spanish rule. On the occasion of the celebration of 186 years of Isabela ur was necessary to adopt an ordinance to establish properly the historical veracity and heraldic elements of the emblazoned shield and official seal of the City of Isabela. The following information was drafted pursuant to Ordinance Number 3, series 2005-2006 and approved by the Municipal Legislature on August 5, 2005: \"The Mural Crown: Current mural crown that has the coat of Isabela has three towers. Due to population increase of over 50,000 inhabitants who had Isabela in this last decade, the HUD office in Washington DC, conferred status as a \"city\" to Isabela last year. Given this demographic reality and focused on the mural crown that represents the spirit of unity and growth of the inhabitants of our city of Isabela, we understand appropriate that the crown mural consists of \"five\" distinct towers that symbolize the passage from town to city.\" ==Gallery== Playa de Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio.jpg|Beach in Isabela Villa Monta\u00f1a Beach Resort - Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio (9).jpg|Villa Monta\u00f1a Beach Resort Bosque Estatal de Guajataca, Puerto Rico.jpg|Guajataca State Forest Isabela, Puerto Rico - panoramio (1).jpg| == See also == *List of Puerto Ricans *History of Puerto Rico *Did you know-Puerto Rico? == References == == Books == * Isabela Economy (18th Century) *Bibliography Colecci\u00f3n de Tesis: Tesis de maestros presentadas en el Departamento de Historia Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Rio Piedras: Col\u00f3n, Maria Judith, Historia de Isabela vista a traves de su desarrollo urbano, 1750\u20131850.
