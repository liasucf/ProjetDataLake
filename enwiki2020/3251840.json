    "text": "Ker\u010bem () is a village on the island of Gozo, Malta, with a population of 1,938 people as of March 2014. The village of Ker\u010bem lies close by to the south-west of Victoria, spread between the picturesque Lunzjata Valley, the green hills of Tal-Mixta, G\u0127ar Ilma and Ta' Dbie\u0121i, and stretching up to the Pond of G\u0127adira ta' San Rafflu and Xlendi cliffs. Archaeological discoveries show that the sizeable area of Ker\u010bem was inhabited as early as the G\u0127ar Dalam phase (5000\u20134500 BC). The Roman Baths and an early Christian cemetery at G\u0127ar Gerduf, referred to by Gozitan historian Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis as Roman Catacombs, are also significant discoveries. However, to date, these historic sites are not accessible to the public. Ta' Ker\u010bem evolved into a village community in the late Middle Ages, around an ancient chapel dedicated to Pope Gregory the Great built around 1581. The site gained historical importance due to the annual traditional St. Gregory procession from the Matrix church in Rabat (Victoria) to this medieval chapel, upon the saint's feast, namely on 12 March. The chapel was, however, replaced by the present parish church in 1851, which in turn was enlarged later on to its present state between 1906 and 1910. Ta' Kercem became a distinct parish on 10 March 1885 by Bishop Pietru Pace. The Ta' Kercem parish church is the only Gozitan church which is jointly dedicated to two saints. As referred earlier, it was traditionally dedicated to Pope Gregory, but, since 17 August 1885, the church was additionally co-dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The village of Ta' Ker\u010bem has a population of around 1700 people. Cultural activities include the annual G\u0127adira Fair, which is a popular traditional family fair in the countryside area of San Rafflu. The hamlet of Santa Lu\u010bija, Gozo, although in itself incorporated within Ta' Ker\u010bem, is quite distinct with its rustic church square. Santa Lu\u010bija is inhabited by country folk with a few old houses built around an old chapel dedicated to St. Lucy. In 2018, the former police station in the locality was vacated and put for sale. ==Zones in Ker\u010bem== *Fuq il-Blat *G\u0127ajn Abdul *G\u0127ar Ilma *I\u010b-\u010anus *Ix-Xag\u0127ri *Klula *Lekx *Sarraflu *Ta' Berrini *Ta' \u010aajplu *Ta' \u0120anton *Ta' Katas *Ta' Majru *Ta' Summina *Ta' Xkura *Tal-Warda *Wardija *Wied il-\u0120ifna *Wied tal- Grixti ==References== ==External links== *Awarded \"EDEN - European Destinations of Excellence\" non traditional tourist destination 2008 *Images from the picturesque hamlet of Santa Lucija Category:Towns in Malta Category:Local councils of Malta Category:Gozo ",
