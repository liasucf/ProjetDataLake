    "text": "\"Kivotos (2020 Version)\" (, ) is a song by Greek singer Katy Garbi featuring Antonis Remos. It was released on digital platforms on 27 April 2020 by Panik Platinum, a sub-label of Panik Records, as the fourth single from her upcoming twenty-first studio album. \"Kivotos (2020 Version)\" will be one of five new duets of previously recorded songs by Garbi written and produced by Phoebus to be featured on the upcoming album. To promote the song, Garbi released a music video in conjunction with Kivotos tou Kosmou (), a non-profit charity organisation supporting special care and protection of \"mother and child\". All proceeds from the sale of the single are donated to Kivotos tou Kosmou. ==Background and composition== \"Kivotos\" was written by Phoebus and first included on Garbi's eighth studio album Evaisthisies, released in 1997. The album was one of the largest commercial successes of the 1990s, with nine of the twelve tracks (including \"Kivotos\") becoming singles. On 10 January 2019, music news websites began reporting on the re-collaboration of Garbi and Phoebus and the release of an upbeat track with a \"fresh\" sound penned by the songwriter. On 22 January 2019, Garbi\u2019s official fanclub, Garbofans, and Pheobus' official fanclub held a competition in which five social media users would be chosen to attend the songwriter's studio and listen to the new track before its public release. On 30 January 2019, Garbi and Phoebus appeared on Rythmos Radio 94,9, announcing during the interview that they would be recording a full album together, which would incorporate five new songs and five previously released tracks performed as duets. One of those songs was an updated version of \"Kivotos\", which was released for airplay and streaming on 27 April 2020. ==Music video and promotion== On 8 April 2020, Panik Platinum posted a video of Garbi on their Instagram account, asking fans to send in photos symbolising their relationship with their parents. The photos would be featured in the music video for \"Kivotos (2020 Version)\", promoting the non- profit charity Kivotos tou Kosmou () in their campaign for the special care and protection of mothers and children. The music video was released on 28 April 2020. ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- !
