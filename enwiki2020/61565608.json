It was the first BDO World Darts Championship not held at the Lakeside Country Club since 1985. Gabriel Pascaru and Thibault Tricole became the first players from Romania and France respectively to play in a World Darts Championship. Three-time men's defending champion Glen Durrant was absent from the event, having switched to the Professional Darts Corporation in January 2019. The reigning women's champion was Mikuru Suzuki. She successfully retained her title, by defeating Lisa Ashton 3\u20130 in the final. Wayne Warren won his first world title with a 7\u20134 win over fellow Welshman Jim Williams in the final. He became the oldest player ever to win a world title. It was the final World Darts Championship organised by the BDO after the collapse of the organisation in September 2020. Following the tournament, the World Darts Federation announced plans to launch the WDF World Championship in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic these plans were pushed back to 2021. == Prize money == On 30 December 2019, less than a week before the tournament was due to start, it was announced that due to ticket sales of only 15%, the prize money would be 'reduced somewhat'. A reduction from \u00a3359,000 to \u00a3150,000 was reported in the media but prize money aside from the winners was unconfirmed. It was thought that the prize money would be reduced by half in most cases, although this was unconfirmed. On 15 January 2020, the prize fund was finally revealed with the men's champion portion dropping from \u00a3100,000 last year to only \u00a323,000 this year. On 11 February 2020, it was reported that players had still not received any prize money, despite payment being due by 9 February, 28 days after the tournament ended.
