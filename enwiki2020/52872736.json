    "text": "The FC Basel 1898\u201399 season was their sixth season since the club's foundation on 15 November 1893. This was the first season in which they competed for the Swiss championship. The club's chairman was Charlie Volderauer, who was chairman between 1896 and 1900. He was the third chairman in the club's history, following Roland Geldner (1893\u20131896) and Emanuel Schiess (1896). FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof, in the Quarter Kleinbasel. == Overview == Although the first national championship in Switzerland took place in 1897\u201398 it is considered as unofficial because it was not organized by the Swiss Football Association (SFA; founded in 1895). FC Basel did not participate in this first championship, but did in the second edition during the season 1898\u201399. The club did not compete in the following season either, but have participated in every season since 1900\u201301. The 1898\u201399 championship was played as a knock out competition, divided into three regional groups, East (region Z\u00fcrich) Central (regional north-west Switzerland) and West (Romandy). The winners of each group played the finals in a Round-robin tournament. Basel played in the central group against Old Boys. Because the game ended was drawn it required a replay, which was also drawn, despite an agreed two times 20 minutes extra time. Because the Old Boys complained that one of the two FCB goals had been scored by hand and protested, the SFA had to deal with the matter. Subsequently, the protest was approved - and the disputed goal simply deducted from the final result. == Players == == Results == === Legend === === Serie A === ==== Central group ==== NB: Old Boys win 2\u20131 after protesting to the SFA ==See also== * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons == Sources == * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2014/2015.
