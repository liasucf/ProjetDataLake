    "text": "Within piston engines, a wet sump is part of a lubrication system whereby the crankcase sump is used as an integral oil reservoir. An alternative system is the dry sump, whereby oil is pumped from a shallow sump into an external reservoir.Wet sump and dry sump compared - https://www.knowyourparts.com/technical-resources/engine/oil-system- differences/#:~:text=Dry%20Oil%20Systems%20Wet%20sump%20systems%20store%20the,is%20used%20to%20pump%20oil%20from%20the%20motor. Piston engines are lubricated by oil which is pumped into various bearings, and thereafter allowed to drain to the base of the engine under gravity. In most production cars and motorcycles, which use a wet sump system, the oil is collected in a 3 to 10 l volume pan at the base of the engine, known as the sump or oil pan, where it is pumped back up to the bearings by the oil pump, internal to the engine. A wet sump offers the advantage of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir. Since the sump is internal, there is no need for hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak. An internal oil pump is generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design. A wet sump design can be problematic in a racing car, as the large g-force pulled by drivers going around corners causes the oil in the pan to slosh, gravitating away from the oil pick-up, briefly starving the system of oil and damaging the engine. However, on a motorcycle this difficulty does not arise, as a bike leans into corners and the oil is not displaced sideways. Nevertheless, racing motorcycles usually benefit from dry sump lubrication, as the shallow sump allows the engine to be mounted lower in the frame; and a remote oil tank can enables improved lubricant cooling. On some dry sump motorcycles, such as the Yamaha TRX850 and the Yamaha TDM, the oil tank is integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox. Early stationary engines employed a small scoop on the extremity of the crankshaft or connecting rod to assist with the lubrication of the cylinder walls by means of a splashing action. == Two- stroke and four-stroke engines == Small two-stroke engines, such as in motorcycles and lawnmowers, have total loss lubrication. Such engines use crankcase compression to feed the fuel/air mixture through the crankcase. This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry sump systems, as excess oil here would contaminate the mixture, leading to excess oil being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions. These engines consume a fuel/air/oil mixe, the oil contained in a pre-mixed petroil fuel, or separately injected by a pump into the engine cylinders and bearings. Four- stroke engines large (non-petrol) two-stroke engines used in locomotives and ships may have either wet or dry sumps. Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots supercharger or a turbocharger. ==Types of Wet Sump== * The Splash System * The Splash and Pressure System * The full Pressure Feed System ==References== Category:Engine lubrication systems ",
