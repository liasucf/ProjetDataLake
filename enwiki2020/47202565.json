The inaugural concert was held at Gran Teatro La Fenice in Venice, Italy on the 10th May 2010 and was directed by Riccardo Chailly. == History == The Association Orchestra Filarmonica del Gran Teatro La Fenice di Venezia performs its activity in concordance with Consiglio di Amministrazione della Fondazione Teatro La Fenice, intending the promotion and diffusion of music, especially the symphonic genre, regionally, nationally and internationally.
