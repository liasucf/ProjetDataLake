It replaced the historic Church of the Dormition of Our Lady as the Greek Cathedral for the city. With its consecration it became the new cathedral of the Greek Orthodox diocese of Aleppo. In April 2013 during the Syrian civil war, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop Paul (Yazigi), who resided in the cathedral, was kidnapped together with the Syrian Orthodox Archbishop Gregorios Yohanna Ibrahim by forces allegedly loyal to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The two clergymen have not appeared since then, and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Prophet Elijah has been without an archbishop since 2013. ==See also== *List of churches in Aleppo ==References== Category:Cathedrals in Aleppo Category:Eastern Orthodox church buildings in Syria Category:Churches completed in 2000 Category:Greek Orthodoxy in Syria Category:Jdeydeh quarter Category:Church buildings with domes Category:Greek Orthodox cathedrals in Asia ",
