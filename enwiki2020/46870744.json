    "text": "Cortinarius luteicolor is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). It was described as new to science in 1944 by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith, who called it Cortinarius orichalceus var. olympianus f. luteifolius. Molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer DNA regions demonstrated that this taxon was sufficiently distinct genetically to warrant designation as a species, and it was renamed in 2014. The mushroom is found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, and British Columbia in Canada. The specific epithet luteicolor refers to yellowish colors of the cap and gills. ==See also== *List of Cortinarius species ==References== ==External links== * luteicolor Category:Fungi described in 1944 Category:Fungi of Canada Category:Fungi of the United States ",
