    "text": "{| |} The Acacia class was a class of twenty-four sloops that were ordered in January 1915 under the Emergency War Programme for the Royal Navy in World War I as part of the larger which were also referred to as the \"Cabbage class\", or \"Herbaceous Borders\". They were ordered in two batches, twelve ships on 1 January and another twelve on 12 January, and all were launched within about four or five months, and delivered between May and September 1915. They were used almost entirely for minesweeping until 1917, when they were transferred to escort duty. They were single-screw fleet sweeping vessels (sloops) with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working. == Ships == * -- built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson, Wallsend on Tyne, launched 15 April 1915.
