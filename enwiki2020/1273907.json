    "text": "Levin Sch\u00fccking, 1848 Levin Sch\u00fccking (full name: Christoph Bernhard Levin Matthias Sch\u00fccking; September 6, 1814 \u2013 August 31, 1883) was a German novelist. He was born near Meppen, Kingdom of Prussia, and died in Bad Pyrmont, German Empire. He was the uncle of Levin Ludwig Sch\u00fccking. ==Biography== Born into the Westphalian nobility on the estate of Klemenswerth, near Meppen, his mother, Sibilla Katharina n\u00e9e Busch (1791\u20131831) was a poet who occasionally published, whilst his father was Paulus Modestus Sch\u00fccking. Levin's mother became friend of the poet Annette von Droste- H\u00fclshoff, who wrote her son a letter of introduction when he left home for the gymnasium in M\u00fcnster. Shortly after he left home, his mother died, and Droste- H\u00fclshoff did her best to fill this gap in his life. After studying law at Munich, Heidelberg and G\u00f6ttingen, Sch\u00fccking wished to enter the government judicial service, but, confronted by serious difficulties, abandoned the legal career, and settling at M\u00fcnster in 1837, devoted himself to literary work. In 1841 he removed to Schloss Meersburg on the Lake of Constance. In 1843, Sch\u00fccking married Luise von Gall. Up to this time, Droste-H\u00fclshoff had been a major inspiration in his life, but she and his wife did not get along. Droste- H\u00fclshoff felt he neglected her and that his head was too turned by the revolutionary \"young Germany\". And then Sch\u00fccking published a novel on the Westphalian nobility, which did not depict them favorably, and Droste- H\u00fclshoff's friends, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, traced many of the depictions back to Droste-H\u00fclshoff. This annoyance led to her avoiding Sch\u00fccking for the rest of her life. Also in 1843, he joined the editorial staff of the Allgemeine Zeitung in Augsburg, and in 1845, he joined that of the K\u00f6lnische Zeitung in Cologne as a literary editor and occasional foreign correspondent. In 1852 he left his career in journalism for his estate in Sassenberg near M\u00fcnster to have more time for writing. He died at Pyrmont on 31 August 1883. ==Works== His first efforts were descriptive: *Das Malerische und romantische Westfalen (1842) *Der Dom zu K\u00f6ln und seine Vollendung (1842) Among his numerous romances, which are distinguished by good taste and patriotic feeling, largely reflecting the sound, sturdy character of the Westphalians, the most noteworthy include: *Ein Schloss am Meer (1843) *Ein Sohn des Vosges (1849) *Ein Staatsgeheimnis (1854) *Verschlungene Wege (1867) *Die Herberge der Gerechtigkeit (1879) Schucking wrote a number of short stories: *Aus den Tagen der grossen Kaiserin (1858) *Neue Novellen (1877) In Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff (1862) he gives a sketch of this poet and acknowledges his indebtedness to her beneficial influence upon his mind. There appeared posthumously, Lebenserinnerungen (1886) and Briefe von Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff und Levin Sch\u00fccking (1893). His wife, Luise (1815\u20131855), daughter of the General Freiherr von Gall, in the Hessian service, published some novels and romances of considerable merit. Among the latter may be mentioned Gegen den Strom (1851) and Der neue Kreuzritter (1853). She also wrote a successful comedy, Ein schlechtes Gewissen (1842). Sch\u00fccking's Gesammelte Erz\u00e4hlungen und Novellen appeared in 6 vols (1859\u20131866); Ausgew\u00e4hlte Romane (12 vols, 1864; 2nd series, also 12 vols, 1874\u20131876). Several of Sch\u00fccking's works appeared in the popular German weekly Die Gartenlaube (such as \"Pulver und Gold\" in January 1871). ==Sources== * * Carl Schurz, Reminiscences (3 vols.), New York: McClure Publ. Co., 1907, Vol. 1, Ch. 3, p. 65\\. Schurz recalls how, as an aspiring writer attending a gymnasium in Cologne, he sent a manuscript to Sch\u00fccking requesting an appointment to get his opinion on the work. Sch\u00fccking granted the appointment, but told the disappointed boy he should regard the work as a \"study.\" Schurz later appreciated the wisdom of this advice. ==Notes== ==References== ;Attribution * * ==External links== * * Sch\u00fccking Museum * * \"Pulver und Gold\", Die Gartenlaube, January 1871, Commons page-image: Comm-Pulver, Wikisource: WikiS- Pulver. *\"Levin Sch\u00fccking (Christoph Bernhard Levin Matthias)\" (schuecking- museum.de) Category:1814 births Category:1883 deaths Category:People from Meppen, Germany Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni Category:German journalists Category:German male journalists Category:19th- century German journalists Category:German male novelists Category:19th- century German novelists Category:19th-century German male writers ",
