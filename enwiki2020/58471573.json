    "text": "David A. Reingold (born 1968) is an American sociologist and higher education administrator. He is the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University. Previously he was the Executive Associate Dean at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs from 2008-2015 and Director of Public Affairs and Public Policy Ph.D. Programs in the School of Public & Environmental Affairs from 2006-2008. ==Education and career== David Reingold was born in 1968 in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood. He attended the University of Chicago Laboratory High School and received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He earned his master's and doctorate from the University of Chicago\u2019s Department of Sociology. He became an Assistant Professor at Indiana University\u2019s School of Public and Environmental Affairs in 1997, an Associate Professor with tenure in 2003, a Professor in 2009. He has also served as Visiting Professor at Central European University, School of Public Policy in 2013-2015. In 2006, he was named Director of Public Affairs and Public Policy Ph.D. Programs in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. In 2008, Reingold was named Executive Associate Dean for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs for the campus at Indiana University Bloomington. In 2015, he was named Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University. ==University leadership== In December 2014, Purdue University announced it had named Reingold the next dean of its College of Liberal Arts. He assumed office on March 1, 2015, as the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University. A letter to the College's faculty and staff set the tone for his administration later that spring. In his first year as Dean, Reingold convened a faculty task force to develop an integrated liberal arts program to engage more students across all Purdue majors, particularly those in STEM majors, with the humanities. The result was the Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts program, which in September 2020 became the model for an initiative led by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Teagle Foundation to replicate the program's general education delivery at colleges and universities across the country. Launched in fall 2017 as a 15-credit certificate program, Cornerstone established a faculty-taught first year sequence to fulfill core curriculum requirements in oral and written communication built around transformative texts, among the greatest that has been said and written. Cornerstone has gained significant notice in the higher education press. Reingold advocated for the importance of general education classes at large research universities, referencing Cornerstone, in an op-ed for the Washington Post. Also in his first year, Reingold came under fire for efforts to strengthen graduate education by managing graduate student enrollments to help increase stipends to a competitive level. The strategy was part of a larger goal of raising the academic profile of the College. Within three years, Purdue stipends had increased from $14,000 to $18,000. Reingold advocated for undergraduate student career aspirations by creating Job-Ready, an award fund to assist students on unpaid and low-paid career-launching internships. In 2016, the College opened the Liberal Arts Career Center to support student internship and job search. Under his leadership, the College launched Degree in 3, which enables students enrolled in each of the College's 10 academic units the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years. A part of Purdue's commitment to value in higher education, the Degree in 3 plans can save students thousands of dollars and enable them to enter the workforce earlier. Degree in 3 was highlighted in a Bloomberg feature on Purdue President Mitch Daniels. In 2019, the College entered into a partnership with Ivy Tech Community College-Lafayette to create three year bachelor's degree paths for graduates of its ASAP accelerated associates degree program. In September 2018, Purdue launched Degree+, a program created to help students complete a bachelor of arts from the College along with a bachelor of science degree without adding time to degree. Degree+ accepts university core curriculum credits and those from the student's first major to fulfill the breadth required by the liberal arts core. On September 25, 2019, it was announced that Purdue University received a planning grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. to create a model program focused on developing curriculum around professional ethics at the intersection of the liberal arts and technological innovation. Reingold serves as principal investigator for the project. As Executive Associate Dean for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University-Bloomington (now the Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs), Reingold was the chief academic and administrative officer for the Bloomington campus. Under his leadership, the School moved to the top of the U.S. News and World Report rankings in 2016. He doubled the School's total revenue in five years within an RCM budgeting environment and also raised over $4M to launch and support the School's VISTA Fellows Program and the Vietnam Young Leaders Award Program. ==Public service== From 2002-04 he served as Director of the Office of Research and Policy Development for the U.S. Corporation for National and Community Service in Washington D.C.

He represented the Corporation for National and Community Service on the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, 2002-2004.
