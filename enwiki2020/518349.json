They were champions of the Saddleworth and District Cricket League in 2003 and moved into the Lancashire County League for 2004 and then into the Greater Manchester Cricket League in 2016. An early member and very young player for Flowery Field Cricket Club was Warren Bradley who later played football for Manchester United and scored in the F.A. Cup. ==Education== Schools in the area include Hyde High School and Flowery Field Primary School and Nursery. Hyde Community College is a secondary school in the area. It is noted for its ICT teaching. The school has a rich history in the area and has been on its current site since the 1940s. As part of the governments building schools for the future programme, the school was completely rebuilt and was opened in November 2012. Flowery Field infants and junior schools are now in a combined building on the original site which opened in January 2015. == Transport == Flowery Field railway station is located on the Glossop/Hadfield Line, running from Manchester Piccadilly to Hadfield.

There are numerous other bus routes and services running throughout the region. ==Facilities== Flowery Field Church is a Tudor Gothic style building, designed by the architect Thomas Worthington, and was completed in 1878. Thomas Ashton (who owned the cotton mill across the road) built the church at his own expense and donated it to the congregation as a sacred trust. During the build the congregation were tasked with raising \u00a31000, which was a huge amount at that time. Upon completion Thomas Ashton then made a magnificent gesture by returning this sum on condition that the money be invested and the interest used to augment a Minister's stipend. The church still has weekly services and an active social calendar, and is open to any denomination as a Free Christian Fellowship 'We uphold the right of everyone to practise the Christian faith in their own personal way'. There is also a local surestart/children's centre. ==References== ==External links== * www.tameside.gov.uk Category:Areas of Greater Manchester Category:Hyde, Greater Manchester ",
