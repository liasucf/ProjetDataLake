    "text": "Fadhel M. Ghannouchi (born 1958 in Gabes, Tunisia) is a Tunisian-Canadian electrical engineer, who conducts research in radio frequency (RF) technology and wireless communications. He has held several invited positions at academic and research institutions in Europe, North America, and Japan. He has provided consulting services to a number of microwave and wireless communications companies. He is currently Professor, Alberta Innovates/the Canada Research Chair, and the Founding Director of the Intelligent RF Radio Technology Laboratory (iRadio Lab), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB. == Education == Professor Ghannouchi obtained his B.Sc. in 1983 from Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal in (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). He completed his M.Sc. in 1984 and Ph.D. in 1987 at the University of Montreal and became a researcher at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. == Career == In 1990, he was appointed Assistant Professor Ecole Polytechnqiue, Montreal, and Associate Professor and director of the Ampli Lab in 1994. In 1997, he became a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Director of the M.Sc. in Micro-electronics program at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (Montreal, Canada) until 2005. In 2005, Dr. Ghannouchi joined the University of Calgary as a Professor and Research Chair at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where he founded the Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), supported by grants from the Government of Alberta (iCORE) and the Government of Canada (Canada Research Chair) and the Canada Foundation of Innovation (CFI), as well as industrial partners. In 2005, he moved to the University of Calgary, as Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, holdings Tier-1 Canada Research Chair in Green Radio Systems and an Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Tier-1 strategic Chair in Intelligent Radio-Frequency (RF) Radio Technology. . He is the founder and director of Calgary's Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab). He also holds an Honorary Distinguished Professorship at the Ningbo University in China , China as well as several short-term position as invited professor in serval academic institutions cross Europe, Asia and Africa. Ghannouchi has supervised 60+ PhD and 40+ postdoctoral researchers. He has founded numerous spin-off companies with his collaborators and students: EMWorks (1995), Amplix (1998) [acquired by Mitec Telecom in 2001], Green Radio Technologies (2011), and AgileMIMIC (2018). ==Research== Dr. Ghannouchi is well known for his contribution in the area of RF amplifier linearization using digital predistortion technique. In May 2009, Dr. Ghannouchi invented the multi-dimensional digital pre-distortion technique and filed a breakthrough patent (US Patent 8,767,857) that have been allowed in 2014 to eliminate the high and costly processing speed requirements of digital predistortion techniques for MIMO transmitters and for concurrent multi-band transmitters driven by carrier aggregated signals. The innovative technology protected by this patent is a key enabling technology for 4G and 5G wireless communications systems. His research interests are microwave and RF instrumentation and measurements, nonlinear modelling of microwave devices and communications systems, design of power and spectrum efficient microwave amplification systems and design of intelligent RF transceivers and SDR radio systems for wireless and satellite communications and Radio over Fiber (RoF) Transceiver Design. He has over 750 referred publications with more than 550 refereed publications in IEEE journals and conferences, 25 US patents (5 pending), one Chinese patent , one Swedish patent and three Canadian patents, and multiple books in the area. His work on designing energy-efficient wireless transmitters has been featured in media outlets such as CBC Radio. Group shot of Prof. Ghannouchi with the iRadio Lab team (2011). ==Books== *W.
