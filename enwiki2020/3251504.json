It is located on Church Street, opposite Sheffield Cathedral, in Sheffield City Centre. ==History and architecture== The Cutlers' Hall was built in 1832 by Samuel Worth and Benjamin Broomhead Taylor at a cost of \u00a36,500. It was extended in 1865-7 by Flockton & Abbott, and again in 1888 by J. B. Mitchel-Withers.\"Pevsner Architectural Guides - Sheffield\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, , Gives details of architecture. It is Sheffield's third Cutlers' Hall, the previous buildings, which were built in the same location, were constructed in 1638 and 1725. Prior to 1638, the cutlers met in rented accommodation with tradition saying that this was a public house on Fargate, although there is no documentary evidence to back this up. The first Cutlers' Hall, a stone building with a slated roof, was built in 1638 at a cost of \u00a3155 15s 10d, of which \u00a357 18s 4d was raised by subscription. The building was quickly found to be inadequate, having to be repaired on many occasions and in 1725, a new Cutlers' Hall was erected on the same site at a cost of \u00a3442 (). It was an attractive, narrow Georgian three storeyed building with a string course cornice. Towards the end of the 18th century the Cutlers' Hall was used as an overspill court room as the Town Hall across Church Street could not cope with the increasing number of crimes.\"Sheffield: Its Story and its Achievements\", Mary Walton, , Info on 1638 and 1725 buildings. The Hall's front is of the Corinthian order. Behind the classical fa\u00e7ade is an intricate series of rooms which reach back almost as far as Fargate.
