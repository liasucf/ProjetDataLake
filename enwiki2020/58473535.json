Specimens collected by Watts are held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. == Education == Watts graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with a MSc (Hons) in Ecology in 1999, and gained a PhD in Invertebrate Ecology from the University of Canterbury in 2006. == Conservation and entomology work == Watts is employed by Landcare Research in Hamilton, New Zealand, in the Biodiversity and Conservation team. Watts has been involved in the conservation of w\u0113t\u0101, including the Mahoenui giant w\u0113t\u0101, a large and endangered species native to New Zealand. Watts has also been involved with Landcare's tui conservation work. Watts has also researched the impacts of predator-fences at Maungatautari, Waikato. In 2006, Watts was part of a team who first described Houdinia flexilissima, a species of moth endemic to New Zealand. == Selected works == * Innes, J.; Watts, C.; Fitzgerald, N.; Thornburrow, D.; Burns, B.; Mackay, J.; Speedy, C.
