In connection with the general election of 1985, he was employed as a campaigner at MUF in S\u00f6rmland.[TT: Nyvald ordf\u00f6rande kritiserar borgerlig trepartisamverkan ] Published 26 November 1988 On 26 November 1988, he rose to become new Chairman of MUF succeeding Beatrice Ask. In 1991, the centre-right Bildt Cabinet took power and soon Kristersson become a vocal critic of the government's crisis agreement with the Social Democrats. In 1992, he was challenged as chairman by Fredrik Reinfeldt, who is the former leader of the Moderate Party. The congress was preceded by considerable ideological divisions between Libertarians and Conservatives. All this erupted at the congress in Lycksele, which came to be known as the Battle of Lycksele. Kristersson, the Libertarian alternative, lost narrowly. It is said that his loss caused his withdrawal from front-line politics and he was subsequently known as part of \"Lost Generation\" of the Moderate Party. === Member of Parliament (1991\u20132000) === In 1991, Kristersson became a Member of the Riksdag (MP). He served in the Social Security Committee. He developed a friendship with the former party leader, G\u00f6sta Bohman, who in some respects also supported his criticism of the Bildt Cabinet.

Kristersson was also asked by Fredrik Reinfeldt to lead the committee responsible for developing a new family policy for the party. He immediately caused controversy by suggesting that fathers must take a month of paternity leave for the family to receive all benefits. This was clearly in conflict with traditional Moderate Party policy, which has centred on individual choice. ==Minister of Social Security (2010\u20132014)== On 5 October 2010, Fredrik Reinfeldt appointed Kristersson to become Minister of Social Security, a position he held for four years. == Return to Parliament (2014\u2013 ) == In 2014, the Reinfeldt cabinet resigned and Kristersson became a Member of the Riksdag (MP) again. === Shadow Minister for Finance === Following the election of Anna Kinberg Batra as Moderate leader and Opposition leader, she appointed him as Shadow Finance Minister in December 2014. ===Leader of the Moderate Party (2017\u2013 )=== Anna Kinberg Batra resigned as leader of the Moderate Party on 25 August 2017.
