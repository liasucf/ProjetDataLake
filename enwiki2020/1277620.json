    "text": "Apollo 17 image Heinrich is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Imbrium, a lunar mare in the northwest quadrant of the Moon's near side. It was named after Czechoslovakian astronomer Vladim\u00edr V\u00e1clav Heinrich. It is a circular, bowl-shaped formation very similar to many other craters of comparable size on the Moon. Heinrich lies to the southwest of the prominent crater Timocharis, and was previously designated as Timocharis A before being given its current name by the IAU. It is otherwise a relatively isolated formation with only a few tiny satellite craters of Timocharis located nearby. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * LTO-40B4 Heinrich -- L&PI; topographic map Category:Impact craters on the Moon Category:Mare Imbrium ",
