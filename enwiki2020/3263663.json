Like his father, he was retained as a martial arts instructor by the Chinese Imperial family. He eventually became the formal teacher of Wu Ch'uan-yu (Wu Quanyou), a Manchu Banner cavalry officer of the Palace Battalion. Wu Ch'uan-yu's son, Wu Chien-ch'uan (Wu Jianquan), also a Banner officer, became known as the co-founder (along with his father) of the Wu- style t'ai chi ch'uan. Yang Pan-hou's younger brother Yang Chien-hou was a well known teacher of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan as well. Yang Pan-hou's son, Yang Shao-p'eng (1875-1938) was also a t'ai chi teacher.
