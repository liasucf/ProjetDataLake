He is one of the protagonists of Germany's MinimalTechno scene. == Biography == Born in Thuringia Dapayk initially came into contact with BrokenBeats and Drum and Bass in the early 90s. His first stage appearances happened as the DrumandBass Live Act 'Frauds in White' and marked the beginning of his career in the electronic music business. With 'Frauds in White' and his former alter ego 'Sonstware' Dapayk became a well- known Resident DJ in Central Germany. By the end of the 90s he reformed his sounds. His productions transcended from broken beats to straight Techno. A form of Techno that is known today as an experimental platform under the alias Dapayk. In 2000, after his first releases Dapayk founded his label 'Mo's Ferry Productions'. The label is mainly dedicated to minimalistic Techno and was extended by the sublabels 'Fenou' in 2005 and 'Rrygular' in 2006. His significant role in MinimalTechno today is due to his appearances as a live act, remixer and various collaborations.
