Played at Amini Park and the Colts Cricket Ground, it will be followed by the men's tournament at the same venues the following week. Six teams participated in the tournament, two more than in the men's version \u2013 at earlier editions of the Pacific Games (previously known as the South Pacific Games), no women's tournament was played. Samoa defeated Papua New Guinea by three runs in the final to win the gold medal, becoming only the second country (after Papua New Guinea) to win a Pacific Games gold medal in cricket. Fiji defeated Vanuatu in a play-off for the bronze medal. The tournament also served as part of the qualification process for the 2018 World Twenty20 in the West Indies, with the top two teams joining Japan in a tri-series in 2016 to decide the ICC East Asia-Pacific region's representative at the World Twenty20 Qualifier in 2017. Because New Caledonia is not an ICC member, a separate system was used to decide which two teams proceeded.(16 June 2015). \"Women's Squads Announced for the 2015 Pacific Games\" \u2013 ICC EAP. Retrieved 8 July 2015. However, the separate system produced the same teams as the regular table.Andrew Nixon (9 July 2015). \"PNG and Samoa progress in World Twenty20 Qualification\" \u2013 Cricket Europe.
