    "text": "An immunity passport, also known as an immunity certificate, recovery certificate or release certificate, is a document attesting that its bearer is immune to a contagious disease. The concept has drawn much attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential way to contain the pandemic and permit faster economy recovery. Similar to quarantine, the registration of citizens is an action of states against an epidemic. ==Concept== Immunity certificates are a legal document granted by a testing authority following a serology test demonstrating that the bearer has antibodies making them immune to a disease. These antibodies can either be produced naturally by recovering from the disease, or triggered through vaccination. Such certificates are practical only if all of the following conditions can be satisfied: * Recovered patients have protective immunity that prevents them from being reinfected * The protective immunity is long-lasting * The pathogen mutates sufficiently slowly for immunity to work against most strains * Immunity tests have low false- positive rates If reliable immunity certificates were available, they could be used to exempt holders from quarantine and social distancing restrictions, permitting them to work (including high-risk occupations such as medical care) and travel. ===COVID-19=== As of May 2020, it remains unclear if any of these conditions have been met for COVID-19. On April 24, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that \"At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an 'immunity passport'\". ==History== An Italian health pass (fede di sanit\u00e0) for travel during times of plague, 1722 Quarantine has been used since ancient times as a method of limiting the spread of infectious disease. Consequently, there has also been a need for documents attesting that a person has completed quarantine or is otherwise known not to be infectious. Since the 1700s, various Italian states issued fedi di sanit\u00e0 to exempt their bearers from quarantine.http://www.passaporto- collezionismo-scripofilia.com/category/fedi-di-sanita/ In 1959, the WHO created the International Certificate of Vaccination (Carte Jaune) as a certificate of vaccination, particularly for yellow fever. However, these are certificates of vaccination, not immunity. An early advocate of immunity passports during the COVID-19 pandemic was Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian opposition leader. In exile and under confinement in Paris, he proposed immunity passports as a way to help restart the economy in a series of articles which he began in March 2020 and published in The Geopolitics and The Brussels Times.The Geopolitics, How to Prevent COVID-19 From Paralysing the World\u2019s Economy, March 27, 2020 The Brussels Times, Immunity Passports: A proposal to revive tourism, international trade and transport April 12, 2020 The Geopolitics, International Immunity Passports Can Help Restore Freedom of Movement, April 8, 2020 The proposals were also published in French.http://www.gavroche-thailande.com/actualites/ailleurs-en- asie/111853-cambodge-coronavirus-l-appel-de-sam-rainsy-pour-des-passeports- immunitaires-afin-de-combattre-l-epidemie-mondiale-de- covid-19?fbclid=IwAR0z21dP7To08ukzp1rKgoxUmGlfrcn4NXoBuWdtede0fnzYlm6BnR58548 In May 2020, Chile started issuing \"release certificates\" to patients who have recovered from COVID-19, but \"the documents will not yet certify immunity\". Many governments including Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States have expressed interest in the concept. ==Arguments== Ethical concerns about immunity certificates have been raised by organizations including Human Rights Watch (HRW). According to HRW, requiring immunity certificates for work or travel could force people into taking tests or risk losing their jobs, create a perverse incentive for people to intentionally infect themselves to acquire immunity certificates, and risk of creating a black market of forged or otherwise falsified immunity certificates. By restricting social, civic, and economic activities, immunity passports may \"compound existing gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality inequities.\" On the other side, it is argued that it would be disproportionate to deprive immune persons \u2013 who can neither infect themselves nor others \u2013 of their basic freedoms. This general prevention would only justified as ultima ratio. Accordingly, Govind Persad and Ezekiel J. Emanuel stress that an immunity passport would follow the \u201cprinciple of the \u2018least restrictive alternative\u2019\u201c and could even benefit society:Persad, Emanuel: The Ethics of COVID-19 Immunity-Based Licenses (\u201cImmunity Passports\u201d). 2020, p. 2241. ==Covid-free certificates== In contrast to immunity certificates, so-called Covid-free certificates assert a person's Covid test result for a short period of time (typically in the range of a few days). In this context, Covid-free certificates link a person's identity to the Covid test result. ==References== Category:Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Passports Category:Immunology ",
