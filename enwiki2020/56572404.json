Christian Cannuyer traces in five chapters the history, the rich artistic and spiritual heritage of the Egyptian Christians known as Copts in a densely illustrated, pocket-sized volume from Gallimard's \"D\u00e9couvertes\" collection\u2014\u2014published in 2000, in the series. The book starts with \"The First Church of Alexandria\" (chap. I), from Roman times (chap. II, \"When Egypt was Christian\"), Islamic Egypt (chap. III, \"Under the Sign of the Crescent\"), Turkish conquest and the rediscovery of Coptic Christians by the West (chap. IV, \"Crossing the Desert\"), up to modern era (chap. V, \"The Copts in the Modern Era\"). The author also gives a brief explanation of the influence of ancient Egyptian culture and religion on the Copts. The \"Documents\" section at the back contains a compilation of excerpts which is divided into five parts: 1, Origins of the Egyptian church; 2, The Desert Fathers; 3, The echoes of ancient Egypt; 4, On earth as it is in heaven; 5, The Copts as seen by the West. In addition to the excerpts, it also features in this section a map of Coptic Egypt, a list of further reading, list of illustrations and an index. The English-language edition entitled Coptic Egypt: The Christians of the Nile, came out in 2001. This book has only been translated into English. In ancient Egypt, religion was an omnipresent phenomenon. The Romans occupied the country at about the time when Christianity was born, an extraordinary phenomenon then took place: little by little, Christ replaced the Egyptian god Osiris, and all the more easily as the Gospels report the almost four-year stay of the Holy Family in the Nile Valley. Alexandria, the great Mediterranean city, was the home to the first Christians in Egypt. According to the tradition, the Church was born here with Saint Mark the Evangelist, which later became part of the Eastern Christian Empire. Egypt even adopted Christianity as its state religion in the 4th century. Egypt at that time\u2014especially Alexandria\u2014was a real crossroads where the ancient culture of the Pharaohs, the Greek and Roman cultures, Judaic and Gnostic currents have had a strong influence on the young Christian communities. The Copts today still use in their liturgy the Coptic language, derived from the ancient Egyptian, to pray in churches and monasteries founded in the 4th century by the Desert Fathers\u2014Anthony, Pachomius, Paul of Thebes\u2014and gather at festivals and pilgrimages dedicated to the Lord, the Mother of God, the saints and the martyrs.
