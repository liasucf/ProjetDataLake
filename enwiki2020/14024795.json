    "text": "In enzymology, a methylated-DNA-[protein]-cysteine S-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :DNA (containing 6-O-methylguanine) + protein L-cysteine \\rightleftharpoons DNA (without 6-O-methylguanine) + protein S-methyl-L-cysteine Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are DNA containing 6-O-methylguanine and protein L-cysteine, whereas its two products are DNA and protein S-methyl-L-cysteine. The S-methyl-L-cysteine residue irreversibly inactivates the protein, allowing only one transfer for each protein. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is DNA-6-O-methylguanine:[protein]-L-cysteine S-methyltransferase. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and . ==References== * * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of known structure ",
