In 1837, some 40 years after he first graduated from Harvard, the university awarded him the Honorary Doctorate of LLD in recognition of his achievements in the field. === Family === White married three times altogether. He married his first wife, Mary van Schalkwyck (the daughter of Dr Josiah Wilder), on 24 May 1807 and had two daughters with him. Some years after van Schalkwyck's death on 29 June 1811, White would marry Eliza Wetmore (the daughter of William Orne) on 1 August 1819 in Salem. Like his White's first wife, Wetmore would die very soon after marrying him. White would be made a widower for the second time after Eliza's death on 27 March 1821. Before her death, though, White and Wetmore would have a son together named Henry. White's third and final wife was Ruth Rogers whom he married on 24 January 1824.
