    "text": "The Legacy Collection is a collection of VST instruments from Korg and was released in 2004. It consists of the Korg MS-20, Korg Polysix, Korg Wavestation, ARP Odyssey (under the later released Korg collection), Korg Mono/Poly, Korg M1, Korg MDE-X Multi FX processor and, as of December 2019, Korg Triton. They use Korg's proprietary CMT (Component Modeling Technology) to emulate the original hardware. The Legacy collection is compatible with ASIO RTAS VST and stand alone so it can be used without a DAW. It is compatible with both the PC and Mac and the software was originally supplied on CD-ROM but can now be downloaded via Korg's online store. ==Instruments== ===MS-20=== Replicates the original monophonic synth but now has 32 voice polyphony. Complete with patch cables. Each knob can be controlled via MIDI. ===Korg Polysix=== The original was only 6-voice polyphonic, but is now up to 32 voices. The LFO and Arpeggiator can be synchronized to MIDI clock. ===Korg Wavestation=== The original had a 32 kHz sample rate and the new plug-in supports 44.1 through 96 kHz and 550 presets. ===Korg Mono/Poly=== Korg have added eight powerful virtual patches for near infinite modulation routing and up to 128 voices. ===Korg M1=== Is 8 part multi-timbral and features up to 256 notes of polyphony. Contains all 19 optional ROM cards, and the full sound set of the T Series. ==Korg Collection== On December 22, 2017 Korg renamed from KORG Legacy Collection series to KORG Collection which now includes: ===Arp Odyssey=== Faithfully reproducing the sounds and parameters based on its original circuitry from its physical state. ===Korg Triton=== Faithfully replicates the Korg Triton hardware, including all factory patches and waveforms, as well as a full collection of the additional EXB-PCM cards. Released December 26, 2019. ==References== ==External links== * KORG Collection Lineup Category:Software synthesizers Category:Audio software Category:Music technology ",
