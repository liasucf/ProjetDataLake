As its name suggests, the road used to run along Singapore's southeastern coastline before extensive land reclamation shifted the coastline southwards. The road started in the west as Mountbatten Road, then continuing eastwards after the junction with Haig Road and Amber Road as East Coast Road. Moving further eastwards, the road continues as Upper East Coast Road () before making a turn northwards and continue as Bedok Road. ==References== Category:Roads in Singapore ",
