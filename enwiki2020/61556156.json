    "text": "Niilo Rudolf Tammisalo (originally Ekbom; 15 October 1894, Helsinki - 5 February 1982, Helsinki) was an influential figure in Finnish sports in the first half of the 20th Century. He was a versatile athlete who represented Finland as a player with the national teams in football, ice hockey, and bandy; he was also on Finnish Champion teams in each of the three sports with domestic clubs. When his career as a player came to a close in the early 1930s, he dedicated himself to coaching, refereeing, teaching, and administrating sports organizations. Tammisalo was a founding member of the Ilves Sports Club and won the Finnish Championship in ice hockey as head coach of Ilves in 1936 and 1937. He was the first chairman of Basketball Finland (1939-1943), served as head coach of the Finnish national football team (1937-38 & 1946), was a sports instructor and lecturer at the University of Helsinki (1938-1958), and served as a referee in international competitions for football, ice hockey, and bandy. == Playing career == The 1911 HJK representative team, winners of the club's first Finnish Championship Cup.
