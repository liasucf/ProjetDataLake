    "text": "{| |} RFA Brambleleaf (A81) was a Leaf-class support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She should not be confused with the support/freighting tanker RFA Brambleleaf of 1959, also with the pennant number A81. Originally built as MV Hudson Deep she was chartered by the Ministry of Defence in 1980. ==Operational history== In April 1982, Brambleleaf was diverted from Armilla Patrol duties in the Persian Gulf for service during the Falklands Conflict.http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa-brambleleaf Due to damage sustained due to severe weather, Brambleleaf transferred her cargo to RFA Tidespring off South Georgia and returned to the UK for repairs during May prior to returning to the South Atlantic in June, and again in August. On 18 November 1983, Brambleleaf sailed along with the assault ship HMS Fearless to support Operation Offcut, providing naval support for British troops in the multi- national force in the Lebanon. In 2003, Brambleleaf was one of 13 RFA ships deployed in support of the second Gulf War. On 18 August 2009 she was towed to Ghent for scrapping. ==References== Category:Tankers of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:Leaf-class tankers Category:Falklands War naval ships of the United Kingdom Category:1976 ships ",
