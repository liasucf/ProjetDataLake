This conference served many high schools located in Cass, Hamilton, Howard, and Miami Counties. The conference dissolved at the end on the 2014-15 academic school year. ==History== The Mid-Indiana Conference can trace its roots back to the late 1940s, when school consolidation reduced the Howard County Conference from nine schools to three in the matter of three years. These three remaining schools joined three nearby schools from Miami County and began the new Howard-Miami Conference. The conference renamed itself the Tri-County Conference in 1955, as two schools from Grant County joined. Further school consolidation reduced membership to four schools by 1965, forcing the conference to reach out of its footprint to find similar-sized schools. This expansion also brought with it the change to its current and final name. Though only one member has consolidated since the MIC name has taken hold, geography, size differences, and competitiveness have all caused various roster changes through the years, with membership as many as nine schools and as few as six. However, membership stabilized after 2000, when Hamilton Heights joined from the folding Rangeline Conference. This ended in 2015, as Eastern and Taylor elected to join an expanding Hoosier Heartland Conference. Maconaquah and Peru are also leaving to join the Three Rivers Conference, while the four remaining schools are off to the Hoosier Athletic Conference. ==Membership== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
