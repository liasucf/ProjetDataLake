The flag carrying the seal of the Philippine President is hoisted outside the cockpit of Philippine Airlines Flight PR001 during President Rodrigo Duterte's official visit to Myanmar in March 2017. The Seal of the President of the Philippines () is a symbol used to represent the history and dignity of the President of the Philippines. Its original form was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo, Secretary of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, and patterned after the Seal of the President of the United States.Executive Order No. 310, Manuel L. Quezon III, May 29, 2005 It was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947. ==Description and Symbolism== The seal is composed of the coat of arms of the president, which, according to Executive Order \u2116 310 of 2004 consists of: The Seal of the President of the Philippines shall consist of the Coat-Of-Arms of the President of the Philippines, and a white circle around the Coat-of-Arms enclosed by two (2) golden-yellow marginal rings. The white circle shall contain the words SAGISAG NG PANGULO NG PILIPINAS (\"Seal of the President of the Philippines\") in black letters on the upper arc, the lower arc divided by three (3) five-pointed golden-yellow stars. Some of the symbols in the arms are derived from the National Flag, and retain their meaning. The eight-rayed sun represent the eight provinces placed under martial law in 1896 at the onset of the Philippine Revolution. On the sun there is an equilateral triangle (colored red as opposed to the Flag's white), representing liberty, equality, and fraternity, which were ideals of the Revolution. The stars at the corners of the triangle represent the three major island groups of Luz\u00f3n, Visayas and Mindanao. At the center of the coat-of-arms is a Sea-lion, which is derived from the coat-of-arms of the City of Manila granted by Philip II of Spain in 1596. It has the upper half of a lion, and the lower half and curled tail of a fish. The Sea-lion as a heraldic device ultimately comes from the lion on the coat-of-arms of Castile and Le\u00f3n; since the islands were an overseas (ultramar) possession, the lion became a sea lion. ==History== The seal was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947. It was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, who also designed the Coat of arms of the Philippines. The Seal was officially prescribed on January 7, 1947, when Executive Order \u2116 38 of 1947 was signed into law. It prescribed the coat of arms and seal of the President as: On July 4, 1951, President Elpidio Quirino, signed Executive Order \u2116 457 into law prescribing that: : At the time of signing, the Philippines had 52 provinces. On August 27, 1998, President Joseph Estrada signed Executive Order \u2116 19, amending Executive Order \u2116 38 of 1947 (as amended) in view of the fact that 1951, the number of provinces has increased to 78 and that there is a need to synchronize the number of stars to match the number of provinces at a given time. After Estrada's Executive Order came into law, Roxas's Executive Order read: On April 20, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order \u2116 310, which standardized the Seal and its derivative material. The Seal as it appears on government documents and property has since been redesigned to conform with the Executive Order. == Evolution of the Presidential Seal == Image: Presidential Seal 1.png|The first seal, with the text SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES.
