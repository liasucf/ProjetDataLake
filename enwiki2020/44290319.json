    "text": "The Quiet Hour is a British science fiction film written and directed by St\u00e9phanie Joalland and produced by Sean Anthony McConville. It stars Dakota Blue Richards, Karl Davies, Jack McMullen, and Brigitte Millar. Humans are few and far between since Earth was invaded by unseen extraterrestrial machines that harvest the planet's natural resources and relentlessly kill its inhabitants. In a remote part of the countryside, where starved humans have become as dangerous as the alien machines hovering in the sky, a feisty 19-year-old girl, Sarah Connolly, sets out on a desperate attempt to fight back a group of bandits and defend her parents' farm, their remaining livestock, and the solar panels that keep them safe from extraterrestrials. If she doesn't succeed, she will lose her only source of food and shelter; but if she resists, she and her helpless blind sibling will be killed. And if the mysterious intruder dressed like a soldier who claims he can help them turns out to be a liar, then the enemy may already be in the house. The film was shot in County Tipperary in Ireland and made its world premiere in July 2014 at the 26th Galway Film Fleadh. It was nominated for Best UK Feature at the 22nd Raindance Film Festival, where it made its UK premiere on 3 October 2014. The film was produced by Frenzy Films and distributed by Vision Films. ==Notes== ==References== *http://www.screendaily.com/news/skins-star-on-quiet- hour-shoot/5058787.article *http://critics- associated.com/events/raindance-2014-rundown-best-uk-feature-film/ *http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/movies/raindance-film-festival-must-see- movies-539471.html *http://www.britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=14596 *http://blueprintreview.co.uk/2014/11/quiet-hour/ ==External links== * Category:2014 films ",
