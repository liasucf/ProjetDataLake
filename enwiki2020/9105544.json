The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui\u00e8mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 p. 885 One former owner of Croizet-Bages was the American Jean-Baptiste Monnot, son of Jean Ferreol Monnot, creator of the Klaxon horn (as well as being a successful miner of gold, silver and copper). Owners Anne Francoise Qui\u00e9 and Jean Philippe Qui\u00e9, who took over from their father Jean-Michel at the estate in 2001, are twins. The family has three M\u00e9doc estates that are all 30 hectares. The original chateau building for Croizet-Bages was built in 1875 along the quays of Pauillac, away from the vines (as is true for Grand-Puy-Ducasse and Duhart-Milon) but it was sold to the town, leaving this estate without the focal point of a grand building. The former chateau is now the Maison de la Culture de Pauillac. Current works are being done to upgrade the buildings in Bages, as the family counts an architect among its members. == References == Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
