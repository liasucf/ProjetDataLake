    "text": "The start of the congress in Prague The Prague Slavic Congress of 1848 (, ) took place in Prague between 2 June and 12 June 1848. It was the first occasion on which voices from nearly all Slav populations of Europe were heard in one place. Several other Slavic Congresses were held in different central and eastern European cities over the next century. ==Background== The seal of the Prague Slavic Congress 1848 The initiative came from Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik and Josip Jela\u010di\u0107, but was organized by Czech activists Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd, Karl Zapp, Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd, and Franti\u0161ek Ladislav Rieger. The exact goal of the Congress was unclear even as it was beginning. In addition to lacking a goal, the conference planners also quarreled over the format and the agenda of the gathering.(Orton 57) Perhaps this was an indication of how difficult the conference would be for the factions to come together. Once underway, the conference met in three sections: Poles and Ukrainians (at that time Ruthenians); South Slavs; and Czecho-Slovaks. The Pole-Ukrainian section contained a combination of Ruthenes, Mazurians, Greater Poles, and Lithuanians.(Orton 62) Of the total 340 delegates at the Congress, the greatest number came from the Czecho-Slovak section. 237 Czecho-Slovaks participated along with 42 South Slavs and 61 Pole-Ukrainian.(Orton 63) German was the primary language used during discussions. During the Congress, there was debate about the role of Austria in the lives of the Slavs. Dr. Josef Fri\u010d argued that the \u201cprimary goal is the preservation of Austria\u201d, adding that the Congress \u201conly differs on the means.\u201d(Orton 69) This point was disputed by \u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far who told the Congress, \u201cour goal is self-preservation\u201d.(Orton 69) Such a disconnect was typical of the environment of this conference. One important statement did come out of the conference around 10 June, when the Manifesto to the Nations of Europe was pronounced. The statement was a strongly worded proclamation that demanded an end to the oppression of the Slav people.(Orton 87) The Slavs did not look for any type of revenge,(Orton 88) but they wanted to \u201cextend a brotherly hand to all neighbouring nations who are prepared to recognize and effectively champion with us the full equality of all nations, irrespective of their political power or size\u201d.(Orton 88) This was an important development because it indicated some sort of unity among all of the Slav people of Europe.(Poli\u0161ensk\u00fd 147) The Congress was cut short on 12 June because of the Prague Uprising of 1848 that erupted due to Austrian garrison in Prague opened fire on a peaceful demonstration.(Orton 86)Gogina, K. 1848 Prague Uprising. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia. 1979 This later became known as the Whitsuntide events because of the timing during the Christian holiday of Pentecost. The delegates left in disgust and some were even arrested because of the revolutionary nature of the Congress(Orton 86) which marked a period in the history of Austria as the Bach's absolutism (after the Interior Minister Baron Alexander von Bach). Among arrested was Mikhail Bakunin who became apprehended in Dresden in 1849 for his involvement in 1848 Prague events and deported to the Russian Empire. == Congress Commissions == ===Czech-Slovak Commission=== * Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd, Czech historian, oversaw the entire conference as president. * Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik, Slovak philologist, poet, literary historian and ethnographer, chairman of the Czecho-Slovaks. * \u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far, Slovak poet, journalist, publisher, teacher, philosopher, linguist and member of the Hungarian Parliament. * Franti\u0161ek Zach, Czech-born soldier and military theorist. ===Polish-Ukrainian Commission=== The commission was created on the initiative of Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd and Mikhail Bakunin.
