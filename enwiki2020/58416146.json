The family was identified as Jewish, and after the order was received to report for deportation they went into hiding. To reduce the risk of discovery, children were separated from their Jewish parents under these circumstances, and Hanneke was accommodated in a succession of secret locations, organised by the (\"Utrechts Kindercomit\u00e9\").

She bonded closely with her \"aunt\", Cor van Starkenburg, and has remained close to the von Starkenburg family subsequently. After the war she returned to her birth-parents' Amsterdam home, now in the house of an uncle who had died in the war. The mood was troubled.

Although the riots were instigated as a protest against the housing shortage under the slogan \"No homes, no coronation\" (\"Geen woning, geen kroning\"), their scale and the accompanying violence led to suggestions that many of the participants had arrived with a larger agenda, and there was a public backlash against the protestors. It was very clear that both Groenteman and Stan van Houcke - with the backing of VARA radio director Piet van den Ende - sympathised with the squatter movement.
