He was minister of the East Church, Aberdeen from 1859 to 1862, and of Kilconquhar church in Fife from 1862 to 1864, a small country village parish, which gave him leisure for study, improved by visits to Germany. On the death of James Frederick Ferrier in 1864, Flint was elected to succeed him in the moral philosophy chair at the University of St Andrews, among the competing candidates being Thomas Hill Green. This chair he held till 1876, when he succeeded Thomas Jackson Crawford in the divinity chair of the University of Edinburgh. On this appointment he was awarded doctorates by both the University of Glasgow (LLD) and the University of Edinburgh (DD). Thomas Chalmers had similarly migrated from the one chair to the other. Flint was appointed to a number of foundation lectureships. He was Baird lecturer (1876-7); in 1880 he travelled to America, and delivered a course as Stone lecturer at Princeton University; in 1887-8 he was Croall lecturer.
