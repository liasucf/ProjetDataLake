    "text": "Rehearsals for Retirement is Phil Ochs's sixth album, released in 1969 on A&M; Records. ==Background== Recorded in the aftermath of Ochs's presence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (where Ochs claimed to have witnessed the symbolic \"death of America\") it is often considered to be the darkest of Ochs's albums, exemplified not just by the lyrical matter but also by its cover: a tombstone sardonically proclaiming that Ochs had died in Chicago. Rehearsals for Retirement saw Ochs exploring folk rock, incorporating orchestral accompaniments and electric guitar into his music. According to English studies scholar David Pichaske, songs such as \"Pretty Smart on My Part\" and \"The Scorpion Departs but Never Returns\" functioned as \"art-protest songs\". The former was written from the perspective of a John Birch Society member who is paranoid of switchblade-toting thieves, foreign operatives, dissident hitchhikers, and dominant, large-breasted women, and acts on this paranoia by killing them and others with a rifle and his friends from the NRA. Pichaske interpreted the narrative as a psychological analysis finding insecurity to be the source of violence in the United States. The latter song used the 1968 disappearance of the Scorpion nuclear submarine as an allegory for a modern \"Lost Generation\" who abandon the U.S. in response to the Vietnam War. ==Reception== Rehearsals for Retirement was the poorest-selling of all of Ochs's albums released during his lifetime, having been deleted from the A&M; Records catalog before sales of 20,000 units had occurred. Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1969, Robert Christgau said the musical arrangements are \"excellent and work for [Ochs'] voice\". While observing \"some predictable bummers\", Christgau highlighted two flashes of greatness with \"The Scorpion Departs But Never Returns\" and \"Another Age\". ==Track listing== All songs by Phil Ochs. ===Side one=== # \"Pretty Smart on My Part\" \u2013 3:18 # \"The Doll House\" \u2013 4:39 # \"I Kill Therefore I Am\" \u2013 2:55 # \"William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed\" - 2:55 # [Untitled] (commonly called \"Where Were You in Chicago?\") \u2013 0:29 # \"My Life\" \u2013 3:12 ===Side two=== # \"The Scorpion Departs but Never Returns\" \u2013 4:15 # \"The World Began in Eden and Ended in Los Angeles\" \u2013 3:06 # \"Doesn't Lenny Live Here Anymore?\" \u2013 6:11 # \"Another Age\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Rehearsals for Retirement\" \u2013 4:09 ==Personnel== *Phil Ochs \u2013 guitar, vocals *Larry Marks \u2013 producer *Lincoln Mayorga \u2013 piano, accordion *Bob Rafkin \u2013 guitar, bass *Kevin Kelley \u2013 drums (rumored) *Ian Freebairn-Smith \u2013 arrangements ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1969 albums Category:Phil Ochs albums Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Albums recorded at A&M; Studios ",
