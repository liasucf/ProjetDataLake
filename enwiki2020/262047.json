It is the centre of the largest district in Brest Region. The population is 10,491 people (2012). The Belarusian-Ukrainian border is about away, so Stolin is now a border city that hosts many Ukrainians on market days. Russian speech is common here, but villagers prefer their own dialects that are akin partly to the Belarusian language, partly the Ukrainian language. ==History== Stolin grew up at the heart of the Polesia region on the Haryn River, at the crossroads of two important routes, one leading northwards to Pinsk, two others eastwards to Davyd-Haradok and Tura\u016d, that are now in Belarus, southwards to Sarny and Kyiv, that are now in Ukraine. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area which Stolin now occupies, was settled as far back as the 12th century AD. The first mention of Stolin dates to 1555. There are three stories regarding the origins of the name \"Stolin\". The first refers to a group of local fisherman who cast their fishing nets into a lake a pulled out 100 fish or Sto [100 in Russian] \"Leeni\" [a type of local fish]. The second story refers to a ferry-boat which sunk in the river and required 100 men with 100 ropes to drag it out [100 lines in Russian]. The third refers to twelve brothers who ruled over seven nearby cities and chose what became Stolin as their meeting place and capital city, hence the name may be a derivation of stol (table)> Stolny Gorod (capital city). website of Stolin in Russian about its history Stolin was occupied by the Germans from July 1941 to 1944. In August 1941, many Jewish refugees \u2013 especially women and children \u2013 from the nearby town of David-Gorodok came to Stolin. A ghetto was created in May 1942, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. About 7,000 Jews lived in this small and unhealthy area, along the Bank River. The liquidation of the ghetto was conducted on September 11, 1942 by a squadron of German cavalry, the local police and the SD. The shooting took place near the airfield, in a large ditch.http://yahadmap.org/#village/stolin- brest-belarus.468 ==International relations== ===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities=== Stolin is twinned with: * Homberg, Germany The memorial in the central square commemorates the first record about Stolin dated 1555.
