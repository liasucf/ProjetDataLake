    "text": "James the Deacon (died after 671) was a Roman deacon who accompanied Paulinus of York on his mission to Northumbria. He was a member of the Gregorian mission which went to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, although when he arrived in England is unknown. After Paulinus left Northumbria, James stayed near Lincoln and continued his missionary efforts, dying sometime after 671 according to the medieval chronicler Bede. ==Life== James was presumably an Italian, like the other members of the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth and his arrival in Britain are unknown.Blair World of Bede p. 98 He went with Paulinus to Northumbria accompanying \u00c6thelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 66\u201367 Edwin died in battle at Hatfield fighting against Penda of Mercia and Caedwalla in 633.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 68 Edwin had been the main supporter of Paulinus' mission, and with his death, a pagan backlash set in. Paulinus fled to Kent, along with \u00c6thelburg and Edwin and \u00c6thelburg's daughter Eanfl\u00e6d. James, however, remained behind in Northumbria and continued missionary efforts. James' efforts were centred in Lincoln, at a church that Paulinus had built there, the remains of which may lie under the church of St. Paul-in-the-Bail.Brooks \"From British to English Christianity\" Conversion and Colonization p. 22 This was in the dependent kingdom of Lindsey, where Paulinus had preached prior to Edwin's death,Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 65 and it was reconquered by one of Edwin's successors, Oswald of Northumbria in the 640s.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 74 Bede writes that James lived in a village near Catterick, which \"bears his name to this day\".Bede History of the English Church p. 139 He reports that James undertook missionary work in the area and lived to a great age. During the reign of King Oswiu of Northumbria, James attended the royal court, for he celebrated Easter with Oswiu's queen, Eanfl\u00e6d, Edwin's daughter. Both James and Eanfl\u00e6d celebrated Easter on the date used by the Roman church, which led to conflicts with Oswiu, who celebrated Easter on the date calculated by the Irish church. These dates did not always agree and were one of the reasons that Oswiu called the Synod of Whitby in 664 to decide which system of Easter calculation his kingdom would use.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 87 James was present at the Synod of Whitby, according to Bede's account of events there.Lapidge \"James the Deacon\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England Bede states that after the synod, and the return of Roman customs, James, as a trained singing master in the Roman and Kentish style, taught many people plainsong or Gregorian chant in the Roman manner. James' date of death is unknown, but Bede implies that he was still alive during Bede's lifetime, which presumably means that he died after Bede's birth, sometime around 671 or 672. This would mean that he was at least 70 years old at his death. It has been suggested that James was Bede's informant for the life of Edwin, the works of Paulinus, and perhaps for the Synod of Whitby.Higham Kingdom of Northumbria p. 107 The historian Frank Stenton calls James \"the one heroic figure in the Roman mission\".Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 116 This reflects the fact that many of the Gregorian missionaries had a habit of fleeing when things went wrong.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 75 After his death, James was venerated as a saint. His feast day is 17 August (Catholic) or 11 October (Church of England). ==See also== * List of members of the Gregorian mission ==Notes== ==Citations== ==References== * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Roman Catholic deacons Category:Gregorian mission Category:History of Yorkshire Category:Northumbrian saints Category:7th-century Christian saints Category:7th-century Christian clergy Category:7th-century English people Category:7th-century English clergy ",
