    "text": "Starting its activities in 1813, the Royal Conservatory of Brussels (French: Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles, Dutch: Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel) received its official name in 1832. Providing performing music and drama courses, the institution became renowned partly because of the international reputation of its successive directors such as Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert, Edgar Tinel, Joseph Jongen or Marcel Poot, but more because it has been attended by many of the top musicians, actors and artists in Belgium such as Arthur Grumiaux, Jos\u00e9 Van Dam, Sigiswald Kuijken, Josse De Pauw, Luk van Mello and Luk De Konink. Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, also studied at the Brussels Conservatory. In 1967, the institution split into two separate entities: the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel, which teaches in Dutch, and the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles, which continued teaching in French. The former entity became a School of Arts of Erasmus University College alongside film school RITCS, and associated with Vrije Universiteit Brussel it also offers Ph.D. degrees in the Arts through Art Platform Brussels. Since 2009, the latter entity has been associated with the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts Visuels La Cambre and the Institut National Sup\u00e9rieur des Arts du Spectacle (INSAS), forming ARTes, an organisation that embraces the three aforementioned art schools of the French Community of Belgium in Brussels. == Building == The current Royal Conservatory building consists of three wings arranged around a courtyard and is the work of architect Jean-Pierre Cluysenaer, built to his designs between 1872 and 1876. The style is neo-Renaissance, influenced by the Lescot Wing of the Louvre. The decorative program of the facade is very elaborate, with five separate pediment sculptures (Instrumental Music by Li\u00e8ge sculptor Adolphe Fassin, Orchestration by Charles van der Stappen, Composition by Antwerp sculptor Frans Deckers, Performing Arts by Antoine-F\u00e9lix Bour\u00e9, and Poetry by Tournai sculptor Barth\u00e9lemy Frison) and other incidental work including garlands, caryatids, palm trees and musical instruments by sculptors Georges Houtstont, Paul de Vigne, Antoine-Joseph Van Rasbourgh, Auguste Braekevelt, and \u00c9gide M\u00e9lot. == Auxiliary activities == === Concerts === Each year a variety of regular student concerts and performances is organised by the Conservatory, boasting over hundred events and enhanced by two festivals. The right wing of the Conservatory contains a 600 seats ornate concert hall in Napoleon-III style with exceptional acoustic qualities, equipped with a Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ. Concert hall of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, SLZ) === Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) === Founded in 1877 to provide students with a practical education about ancien instruments, the Conservatory museum, currently referred to as the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) of Brussels displays over 8.000 ancient instruments acquired by F\u00e9tis, rare pieces from the initial collection, from the various funds or from new acquisitions. Since 2000, the museum, one of the most important ones of its kind, is located in the prestigious Art Nouveau building conceived in 1899 by the Belgian architect Paul Saintenoy for Old England. === Library === Initially created with a pedagogic aim, the Conservatory library hosts about 250.000 references, representing a scientific instrument of international resonance. 350x350px It primarily consists of works about music (including more than 1200 musical or musicological periodicals), as well as of autograph, printed or digitized (scanned) scores. There is also an important collection of more than 8.000 libretti of Italian, French or German operas from the XVIIe and XVIIIe s., lute and guitar tablatures, several thousands of handwritten letters of musicians, iconographic documents (over 9.000 pieces), concert programmes and various types of recordings (magnetic tapes, video, 78 and 33 rpm vinyl, CD, etc.). Next to the core collections, the library possesses several subcollections of historical importance, together forming an extensive patrimony: * the Johann J.H. Westphal collection bought by F\u00e9tis (manuscripts of C.P.E. Bach and G.P. Telemann), * the Richard Wagener collection acquired by the librarian Alfred Wotquenne (German music from the XVIIe, XVIIIe and XIXe s. including 40 autograph manuscripts from three sons of J.-S. Bach), * the Jean-Lucien Hollenfeltz collection (documents of Constance Mozart and her youngest son Franz Xaver Amadeus Mozart), * the Maria Malibran collection (documents and objects from the cantatrice and her close family), * the Edmond Michotte collection (pieces from Rossini's private library), * the J\u00f3zef Wieniawski collection (autograph scores from the pianist), * the Laurent Halleux collection, * the Joseph Jongen collection. The library is open to the general public. In 2015, the library acquired the score collection of CeBeDeM (Belgian Centre for Music Documentation). In doing so it also took over the latter's objectives in promoting Belgian contemporary music worldwide. == Personalities linked to the Royal Conservatory of Brussels == Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste F\u00e9tis, first director of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels === Directors === * 1833-1871: Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis * 1871\u20131908: Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert * 1908\u20131912: Edgar Tinel * 1912\u20131925: L\u00e9on Du Bois * 1925\u20131939: Joseph Jongen * 1939\u20131949: L\u00e9on Jongen * 1949\u20131966: Marcel Poot ==== Directors of the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles ==== * 1966\u20131973: Camille Schmit (in French) * 1974\u20131987: \u00c9ric Feldbusch (in French) * 1987\u20132002: Jean Baily (in French) * 2003\u2013present: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Roos ==== Directors of the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel ==== * 1966-1994: Kamiel D'Hooghe (in Dutch) * 1994-2004: Arie Van Lysebeth (in Dutch) * 2004-2008: Rafael D'Haene * 2008\u20132017: Peter Swinnen * 2017\u2013present: Kathleen Coessens === Notable faculty === * Daniel Blumenthal (piano) * Boyan Vodenitcharov (piano) * Igor Oistrach (violin) * Barthold Kuijken (baroque) * Katarina Glowicka, computer music * Luc Devos (piano) * Jan Michiels (piano) * Lola Bobesco (violin) * Yossif Ivanov (violin) * Adrien Fran\u00e7ois Servais (cello) * Paul Dombrecht (hobo) * Philippe Pierlot (baroque) * Norbert Nozy (brass band) * Andr\u00e9 Souris (direction, composition) * Jacques Leduc (direction, composition) * Charles-Auguste de B\u00e9riot, violin * Fran\u00e7ois Daneels, saxophone * Bernard Foccroule, organ * Julien Ghyoros, direction * Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, organ * Jean Lou\u00ebl, piano * Marie Pleyel, piano * Eliane Reyes, piano * Adolphe Samuel, composition * Henri Vieuxtemps, violin * Henryk Wieniawski, violin * Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, violin * Zygmund Kowalsky (violin) * Yuzuko Horigome (violin) * Valery Oistrach (violin) * Viviane Spanoghe (chamber music) * Erik Robberecht (chamber music) * Alain Gervreau (baroque) * Fran\u00e7ois Fernandez (baroque) * Bart Coen (baroque) * Bruno Castellucci, jazz percussion * Ernest Van Dijck, lyrical art * Annelies Van Parys, form analysis * Jules Zarembski, piano * Philippe Graffin, violin ===Notable alumni=== * Elie Apper * Isaac Alb\u00e9niz * Peter Benoit * Oskar Back * Fabrizio Cassol * Claire Chevallier * Alain Cr\u00e9pin * Fran\u00e7ois Daneels * John Giordano * Edwin Grasse * Mansoor Hosseini * D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Magnus * Alma Moodie * Norbert H.
