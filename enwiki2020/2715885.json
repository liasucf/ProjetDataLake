    "text": "Mabel E. Cahill, from an 1892 publication. Mabel Esmonde Cahill (2 April 1863 \u2013 1 January 1905) was an Irish female tennis player, active in the late 19th century, and was the first foreign woman to win a major tennis tournament when she won the 1891 US National Championships. ==Early life and family== Mabel Cahill was born on 2 April 1863 in the family home of Ballyragget House, Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, the twelfth child of thirteen born into her family. She had 5 sisters and 7 brothers. Being part of this society resulted in having social events held by the upper class. In this case, tennis parties. During this time, it was quite uncommon for women to obtain a secondary level school degree however it has been recorded that Mabel attended Roscrea School with two of her brothers, a fee paying school. There is strong evidence to suggest that Mabel and two of her sisters enrolled in Sacred Heart Convent Secondary School. After school, Mabel moved from her family town of Ballyraggett to the city of Dublin in the year of 1886. At this point she then took part in a club that played lawn tennis which would then spark her love for the sport. Three years after moving to Dublin, Mabel then decided to emigrate to America via the ship, The Arizona which departed from Liverpool and landed in the USA where she took up residency in New York City at the age of 29. ==Career== Cahill won the Orange Club ladies championship in 1890 and 1891. Cahill became the first foreign woman to win a major tournament when she defeated Ellen Roosevelt in the 1891 US Championships women's final at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. She successfully defended her women's singles title in 1892 and also won the women's doubles title with Adeline McKinlay and the mixed doubles title with Clarence Hobart. She did not defend her titles in 1893. ==Grand Slam finals == ===Singles (2 titles) === {| class='sortable wikitable' !style=\"width:65px\"|Outcome !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1891 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Ellen Roosevelt || 6\u20134, 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1892 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Elisabeth Moore || 5\u20137, 6\u20133, 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20132 |} ===Doubles (2 titles) === {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:65px\"|Outcome !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Partner !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1891 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Emma Leavitt-Morgan || Ellen Roosevelt Grace Roosevelt || 2\u20136, 8\u20136, 6\u20134 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1892 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Adeline McKinlay || Helen Day Harris Amy Reeve Williams || 6\u20131, 6\u20133 |} ===Mixed doubles (1 title) === {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:65px\"|Outcome !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Partner !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1892 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Clarence Hobart || Elisabeth Moore Rodmond Beach || 6\u20131, 6\u20133 |} == Later life and death == Cahill also attempted to start a career as a writer during her time in America. She wrote a romantic novel called Her Playthings: Men which was published in 1891 but it was not successful. She tried to write shorter stories, Carved in marble and Purple Sparkling but they too were not well received. In 1893 she contributed two articles to the Ladies Home Journal named The art of playing good tennis and Arranging a tennis tournament, respectively. She died on 1 January 1905 in Ireland. After her death, in 1936, the Irish Lawn Tennis Association placed an advert in the national press asking that a representative of hers could come forward to collect a gold medallion struck to honour her achievements in tennis in America. It is not known if the medallion was collected. In 1976, Cahill was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, where she is the only Irish representative. == References == == External links == * Category:1863 births Category:19th-century female tennis players Category:19th-century Irish people Category:British female tennis players Category:Irish female tennis players Category:Sportspeople from County Kilkenny Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees Category:United States National champions (tennis) Category:1905 deaths Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's singles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's doubles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in mixed doubles ",
