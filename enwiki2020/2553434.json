Songwriter Gretchen Peters received the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1995 for \"Independence Day.\" ==Content== In the song, a daughter (Heidi Butler Prine) recalls a tragic incident she experienced as a child. Her mother (Darcie Jones) was involved in a domestic abuse incident with her alcoholic father (Aaron Wrench). On Independence Day, the daughter walks to the town fair and hears rumors going on about the father's abuse. That day, the mother burns down their house, presumably with the husband and herself inside it, and the daughter is sent to a county home. According to McBride, the mother does not die in the fire, as she has now gained her independence from an abusive relationship. The music video was produced by American director team Deaton- Flanigen Productions, consisting of William Deaton III and George Flanigen IV, and premiered on CMT May 20, 1994. The lyrics have a double meaning in that the woman in the story is finally gaining her \"freedom\" from her abusive husband. Thus, it is her \"Independence Day.\" The title also refers to the fact that the events noted in the song happened on the United States' Independence Day, or July 4. ==In media== Beginning shortly after September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, Sean Hannity began using part of the chorus as an opening bumper for his Premiere Radio Networks radio talk show. The song is about domestic violence, not patriotic values, according to the writer of the song, Gretchen Peters, who does not agree with Hannity's use of the song. Since she could not stop his use, she collected royalties from him every time it was played and used those royalties to donate to her causes, until Hannity's program dropped the song in mid-2014.http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7957 ==Personnel== The following musicians perform on this track: *Joe Chemay - bass guitar *Ashley Cleveland - backing vocals *Paul Franklin - pedal steel guitar *Vicki Hampton - backing vocals *Bill Hullett - acoustic guitar *Mary Ann Kennedy - backing vocals *Brent Mason - electric guitar *Martina McBride - lead and backing vocals *Steve Nathan - keyboards *Pam Rose - background vocals *Lonnie Wilson - drums *Paul Worley - acoustic guitar ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1994) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |} ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Ceremony !align=\"left\"|Award !align=\"left\"|Result |- |align=\"left\"|1994 |align=\"left\"|Academy of Country Music Awards |align=\"left\"|Video of the Year |align=\"left\"|Nominated |- |align=\"left\"|1995 |align=\"left\"|Grammy Awards |align=\"left\"|Best Country & Western Vocal Performance - Female |align=\"left\"|Nominated |- |align=\"left\"|1995 |align=\"left\"|Grammy Awards |align=\"left\"|Best Country Song |align=\"left\"|Nominated |- |align=\"left\"|1995 |align=\"left\"|Country Music Association Awards |align=\"left\"|Song of the Year |align=\"left\"|Won |- |align=\"left\"|1994 |align=\"left\"|Country Music Association Awards |align=\"left\"|Video of the Year |align=\"left\"|Won |} It received the RIAA Gold Certificate on December 12, 2018https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ Accessed on December 27, 2018.. ==Cover versions== In 2002, singer Taylor Horn covered the song for her debut album taylor-made at the age of nine.
