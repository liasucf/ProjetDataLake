Some of the internal units are to be combined and converted to health or leisure units due to continued low demand for retail https://fora.ie/the-point-village-receivers-change-of-use-retail- leisure-4677040-Jun2019/ The office space has been taken by Oath, moving some operations from their main location at East Point Business Park, and Voxpro.
