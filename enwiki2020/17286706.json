    "text": "The George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering is the oldest and second largest department in the College of Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The school offers degree programs in mechanical engineering and nuclear and radiological engineering that are accredited by ABET. In its 2019 ranking list, US News & World Report placed the school ranks 2nd in undergraduate mechanical engineering, 5th in graduate mechanical engineering, and 9th in graduate nuclear and radiological engineering. The school took its present name in 1985, honoring George W. Woodruff (class of 1917), a major benefactor. The school is the only academic institution to be recognized as a Mechanical Engineering Heritage Site by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. == Degrees offered == J.
