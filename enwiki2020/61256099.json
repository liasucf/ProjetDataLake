In his review, Armando B. Chavez of Philippine Daily Inquirer said that the love story stood out due to the \"backdrop of the plight of OFWs in Hong Kong.\" He also praised the musical editing, the close-up shots of the protagonists, and performances of Bernardo and Richards, describing them as tour de force.

Tito Genova Valiente however disagreed and considered the trio's performances as \"aggravating\" while praising Bernardo and Richard, stating, \"There is Bernardo with perhaps the quietest performance for any actress of her generation. Bernardo can act within a small frame, holding her face solidly as if a slight movement will mar that portrayal... Alden gets the cinematographic love, as well. His Ethan starts fun and ends tragic but with lots of hope, even if it does not matter what happens to that hope. When those tears fall from Richards's eyes, they bring us back to those old, old cinemas of leading men looking beautiful and strong in grief.\" ==Possible sequel== On August 1, 2019, during the opening week of the film, lead actor Alden Richards and director Cathy Garcia-Molina expressed openness on working on a sequel for the film despite the latter's confirming plans to retire from directing to focus on her family.
