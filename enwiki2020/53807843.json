    "text": "In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a k-synchronized sequence is an infinite sequence of terms s(n) characterized by a finite automaton taking as input two strings m and n, each expressed in some fixed base k, and accepting if m = s(n). The class of k-synchronized sequences lies between the classes of k-automatic sequences and k-regular sequences. ==Definitions== ===As relations=== Let \u03a3 be an alphabet of k symbols where k \u2265 2, and let [n]k denote the base-k representation of some number n. Given r \u2265 2, a subset R of \\mathbb{N}^{r} is k-synchronized if the relation {([n1]k, ..., [nr]k)} is a right-synchronized rational relation over \u03a3\u2217 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 \u03a3\u2217, where (n1, ..., nr) \\in R.Carpi & Maggi (2010) ===Language-theoretic=== Let n \u2265 0 be a natural number and let f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} be a map, where both n and f(n) are expressed in base k. The sequence f(n) is k-synchronized if the language of pairs \\\\{(n, f(n))\\\\} is regular. ==History== The class of k-synchronized sequences was introduced by Carpi and Maggi. ==Example== ===Subword complexity=== Given a k-automatic sequence s(n) and an infinite string S = s(1)s(2)..., let \u03c1S(n) denote the subword complexity of S; that is, the number of distinct subwords of length n in S. Go\u010d, Schaeffer, and Shallit demonstrated that there exists a finite automaton accepting the language : \\\\{(n, m)_k \\mid n \\geq 0 \\text{ and } m = \\rho_S(n)\\\\}. This automaton guesses the endpoints of every contiguous block of symbols in S and verifies that each subword of length n starting within a given block is novel while all other subwords are not. It then verifies that m is the sum of the sizes of the blocks. Since the pair (n, m)k is accepted by this automaton, the subword complexity function of the k-automatic sequence s(n) is k-synchronized. ==Properties== k-synchronized sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below. *Every k-synchronized sequence is k-regular.Carpi & Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.6 *Every k-automatic sequence is k-synchronized. To be precise, a sequence s(n) is k-automatic if and only if s(n) is k-synchronized and s(n) takes on finitely many terms.Carpi & Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.8 This is an immediate consequence of both the above property and the fact that every k-regular sequence taking on finitely many terms is k-automatic. *The class of k-synchronized sequences is closed under termwise sum and termwise composition.Carpi & Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.1Carpi & Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.2 *The terms of any k-synchronized sequence have a linear growth rate.Carpi & Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.5 *If s(n) is a k-synchronized sequence, then both the subword complexity of s(n) and the palindromic complexity of s(n) (similar to subword complexity, but for distinct palindromes) are k-regular sequences. ==Notes== ==References== *.
