    "text": "This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in the northern part of the province of Saskatchewan. ==Regional profile== Like southern Saskatchewan, the northern areas traditionally feature a strong urban-rural split, although it is less pronounced here. The Conservatives swept here in 2004 and the former Canadian Alliance also nearly swept the region in 2000. The rural areas (except for far Northern Saskatchewan) are almost as conservative as their counterparts in Alberta. The far north with its high first nations population has stronger support for the New Democrats and Liberals, and the Liberals were able to pick up the far northern seat in 2006 in a controversial close election. While Saskatoon also has large Liberal support as well as traditional NDP support, this was diluted for much of the early part of the millennium by the riding map. While Saskatoon has double the population of a typical Canadian urban riding, until 2015 the surrounding rural areas were thought to be too thinly populated for ridings of their own. As a result, for almost two decades Saskatoon's four federal ridings included large blocks of rural territory, a major reason why the NDP and Liberals were shut out in Saskatoon from 2000 to 2015. With the 2015 redistribution, Saskatoon is split between three ridings located almost entirely within the city limits. The NDP won one Saskatoon seat in 2015, and also took the far northern seat. Those gains were reversed in 2019, as the massive Conservative wave that swept through Saskatchewan saw the party sweep every seat in the province. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Battlefords\u2014Lloydminster #Blackstrap #Desneth\u00e9\u2014Missinippi\u2014Churchill River #Prince Albert #Saskatoon\u2014Humboldt #Saskatoon\u2014Rosetown\u2014Biggar #Saskatoon\u2014Wanuskewin Image:nskcpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada Image:nskgpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada Image:nsklpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada Image:nskndp.PNG|New Democratic Party ==2000 - 37th General Election== Saskatchewan, North Category:Elections in Saskatchewan ",
