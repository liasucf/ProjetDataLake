The name literally means 'North Land Way'. It also refers to a series of roads that connected the capitals (\u56fd\u5e9c kokufu) of each of the provinces that made up the region. When the Gokishichid\u014d system was initially established after the Taika reforms, it consisted of just two provinces: Wakasa and Koshi. During the reign of Emperor Temmu, Koshi was divided into three regions: Echizen, Etch\u016b and Echigo and Sado Island was added as a fifth province. Later, Noto and Kaga were carved out of Echizen to form seven provinces in total. The Hokuriku subregion of Ch\u016bbu region constitutes Hokurikud\u014d region today. ==See also== * Comparison of past and present administrative divisions of Japan * Hokuriku subregion * Koshi Province ==Notes== ==References== * Nussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and K\u00e4the Roth.
