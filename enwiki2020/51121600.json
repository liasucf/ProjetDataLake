    "text": "Blue Anchor Line advertisement, 1903 Lund's Blue Anchor Line was a shipping company operating between the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia between 1870 and 1910. The owners of this shipping company in later years were Messrs. W. Lund and Sons. The Blue Anchor Line was founded in London by Wilhelm Lund (b. Denmark 1837, d. Kent, 1928) in 1869. His two sons were Albert Edward Lund and Friedrich Wilhelm Lund, who was also called Frederick Lund, and is also recorded as F.W. Lund Jr. (because his grandfather, also a ship-owner, was also called Friedrich Wilhelm Lund). An \"H. Lund\" also appears in relation to the business. Originally sailing ships were used. Between 1880 and 1890, sailing ships were replaced by steamers. Ships operated by this company include Waratah, Commonwealth, Bungaree, Geelong, Wilcannia, Narrung, and Wakool. The disappearance of the Waratah near Durban in 1909 resulted in the commercial failure of the company. Its ships were sold to P&O;, and it was wound up in 1910. An inquiry was held in London to investigate the disappearance of the Waratah, and F.W.Lund Jr., who gave evidence at the inquiry on behalf of the owners, was described in some newspaper reports as the chairman of directors of the company, although it appears to have actually been a partnership, in which Wilhelm Lund was still the senior partner. The wreck of the Waratah has never been found, and the cause of its loss remains inconclusive and still attracts controversy. Despite this setback, Wilhelm Lund and F.W. Lund continued to be respectable businessmen. == References == ==External links== * Category:Defunct shipping companies of the United Kingdom Category:Transport companies disestablished in 1910 Category:Transport companies established in 1869 Category:1869 establishments in England Category:1910 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1910 Category:British companies established in 1869 ",
