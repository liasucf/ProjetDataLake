A convent had been present at the site, dedicated to Santa Margherita of Cortona. The structures were refurbished circa 1830 under the Austrian administration, incorporating a church and buildings which served as a school for orphans.Comune of Modena entry on Palazzo Margherita. The exterior facade was designed by Francesco Vandelli.Modena e provincia: le regge del ducato estense, Carpi, Vignola, Nonantola, Guida d'Italia, Touring Club Italiano, page 47. The building now houses a series of civic museums, including the Galleria Civica di Modena and the Museo della figurina, as well as the Istituto Musicale Orazio Vecchi and the public library Biblioteca Delfini. In 1995, the civic gallery was moved to this building. Since 1983, another hall for exhibitions has been the nearby Palazzina dei Giardini: formerly a hunting casino, in the gardens of the Ducal Palace of Modena.
