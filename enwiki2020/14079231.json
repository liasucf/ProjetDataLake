    "text": "A flying gyroscope (also known as a flying cylinder or flying tube) is a cylindrical wing or annular airfoil. It is thrown like a football, and can fly very far. The William Mark Corporation invented their flying gyroscope, X-Zylo, in 1993. It was invented by Mark Forti, a Baylor University student, and refined within the aerospace industry. In 1994, X-Zylo unofficially broke the existing world flying disc distance record when it was thrown . \"Toobee, The Amazing Flying Can\" is a flying gyroscope developed in 1978. It resembles the top third of an aluminum soda can.
