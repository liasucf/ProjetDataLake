    "text": "Euphorbia cedrorum is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae endemic to Madagascar. ==Distribution and habitat== Although described in 1993 from a cultivated specimen, in the wild the species is known only from one single later collection on the side of the Antananarivo-Tulear road, Tulear (Toliara) area, in south-west Madagascar. Only a few mature specimens are known to occur within this only known locality. Based on this collection, its natural habitat appears to be subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. ==Conservation== Very little is known about the status of the species, but it appears not to be common. Its habitat is considered to be threatened by clearing for farming and charcoal burning. ==References== Category:Endemic flora of Madagascar cedrorum Category:Endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
