The man behind the Foreign Policy Society was Ole Lippmann, a member of the Danish resistance movement. In his mind, foreign policy was a matter far too important to be entrusted only to politicians and government officials. Civil society should participate in the debate on international affairs, whose involvement should take place on an informed and qualified basis. The Society was established in Copenhagen on 31 October 1946. The founders were well-known men from the resistance movement, including Ole Lippmann, Svend Truelsen, Erik Husfeldt, Ebbe Munck; politicians such as Per Federspiel and Thorkil Kristensen from the Liberal Party, Ole Bj\u00f8rn Kraft from the Conservative Party, and the communists Ib N\u00f8rlund and Peter P. Rohde. Academia was represented by, among others, professors Alf Ross and Hartvig Frisch. ==References== Category:Foreign policy and strategy think tanks in Europe Category:Think tanks based in Denmark Category:1946 establishments in Denmark ",
