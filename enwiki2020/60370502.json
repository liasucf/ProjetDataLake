    "text": "Daphnella tetartemoris is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Raphitomidae.J.C. Melvill (1917), A revision of the Turridae (Pleurotomidae) occurring in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and North Arabian Sea, as evidenced mostly through the results of dredgings carried out by Mr. F. W. Townsend, 1893-1914; Proceedings of the Malacological Society of London vol. 12, 1917 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 8 mm, its diameter 2.5 mm This is a remarkably graceful, attenuate-fusiform shell. It contains seven whorls, of which three in the protoconch. The shell is conspicuous for its strong yet thread-like angled keels, one upon the upper whorls, two on the lower, while a rectangular appearance is obtained by the six longitudinal remote yet regular ribs on each whorl, these not being exactly continuous, as is the case with the sculpture of some Mangiliae. The apical whorls are beautifully cancellate. The colour of the remainder is pale ochreous or straw-colour, slightly intensified on the ribs. The spiral lines crossing the whorls are close and uniform. The sinus is broad, but shallow. The outer lip is thin. The aperture is narrowly oblong. The siphonal canal is slightly prolonged. J.C. Melvill (1910) Descriptions of Twenty-nine Species of Marine Mollusca from the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and North Arabian Sea; The Annals and magazine of natural history; zoology, botany, and geology being a continuation of the Annals combined with Loudon and Charlesworth's Magazine of Natural History; 8th ser. vol. VI It differs from Daphnella omaleyi (Melvill, 1899) in its quadrate sculpture, two acute keels existing on the lower whorls, one on the upper, crossing six remote yet regular ribs. The whorls of the protoconch are delicately decussately cancellate. ==Distribution== This species occurs off Astola Island in the Arabian Sea. ==References== ==External links== * tetartemoris Category:Gastropods described in 1910 ",
