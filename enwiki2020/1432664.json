    "text": "A choice function (selector, selection) is a mathematical function f that is defined on some collection X of nonempty sets and assigns to each set S in that collection some element f(S) of S. In other words, f is a choice function for X if and only if it belongs to the direct product of X. == An example == Let X = { {1,4,7}, {9}, {2,7} }. Then the function that assigns 7 to the set {1,4,7}, 9 to {9}, and 2 to {2,7} is a choice function on X. == History and importance == Ernst Zermelo (1904) introduced choice functions as well as the axiom of choice (AC) and proved the well-ordering theorem, which states that every set can be well-ordered. AC states that every set of nonempty sets has a choice function. A weaker form of AC, the axiom of countable choice (AC\u03c9) states that every countable set of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, in the absence of either AC or AC\u03c9, some sets can still be shown to have a choice function. *If X is a finite set of nonempty sets, then one can construct a choice function for X by picking one element from each member of X. This requires only finitely many choices, so neither AC or AC\u03c9 is needed. *If every member of X is a nonempty set, and the union \\bigcup X is well- ordered, then one may choose the least element of each member of X. In this case, it was possible to simultaneously well-order every member of X by making just one choice of a well-order of the union, so neither AC nor AC\u03c9 was needed. (This example shows that the well-ordering theorem implies AC. The converse is also true, but less trivial.) == Choice function of a multivalued map == Given two sets X and Y, let F be a multivalued map from X and Y (equivalently, F:X\\rightarrow\\mathcal{P}(Y)is a function from X to the power set of Y). A function f: X \\rightarrow Y is said to be a selection of F, if: :\\forall x \\in X \\, ( f(x) \\in F(x) ) \\,. The existence of more regular choice functions, namely continuous or measurable selections is important in the theory of differential inclusions, optimal control, and mathematical economics. See Selection theorem. ==Bourbaki tau function== Nicolas Bourbaki used epsilon calculus for their foundations that had a \\tau symbol that could be interpreted as choosing an object (if one existed) that satisfies a given proposition. So if P(x) is a predicate, then \\tau_{x}(P) is one particular object that satisfies P (if one exists, otherwise it returns an arbitrary object). Hence we may obtain quantifiers from the choice function, for example P( \\tau_{x}(P)) was equivalent to (\\exists x)(P(x)). However, Bourbaki's choice operator is stronger than usual: it's a global choice operator. That is, it implies the axiom of global choice.John Harrison, \"The Bourbaki View\" eprint. Hilbert realized this when introducing epsilon calculus.\"Here, moreover, we come upon a very remarkable circumstance, namely, that all of these transfinite axioms are derivable from a single axiom, one that also contains the core of one of the most attacked axioms in the literature of mathematics, namely, the axiom of choice: A(a)\\to A(\\varepsilon(A)), where \\varepsilon is the transfinite logical choice function.\" Hilbert (1925), \u201cOn the Infinite\u201d, excerpted in Jean van Heijenoort, From Frege to G\u00f6del, p. 382.
