Pua ala inhabits mesic shrublands and forests on rocky cliffs from sea level to on the island's northern windward coast. Associated plants include \u014dhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), alahee (Psydrax odorata), lama (Diospyros sandwicensis), \u016blei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia), and naupaka (Scaevola gaudichaudii). Pua ala reaches a height of and has a succulent, trunk-like stem that tapers from the base. The oval-shaped leaves are long and wide and form a rosette on the top of the plant. Each inflorescence contains three to eight trumpet-shaped white flowers. ==Conservation== Pua ala has been extirpated from the islands of L\u0101nai and Maui. Threats to its survival include habitat loss, competition with alien plants, predation by goats and deer, and a lack of pollinators. There are five occurrences of the plant remaining in the wild, with a total estimated population of fewer than 200.The Nature Conservancy It is federally listed as an endangered species. It is now pollinated by the introduced hawk moth Daphnis nerii. Some individuals have been cultivated and planted in the habitat.USFWS. Brighamia rockii Five Year Review.
