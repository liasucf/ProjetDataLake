If a team scored four tries in a match and loses by seven points or fewer, they are awarded both bonus points. * Three bonus points are awarded to a team that wins all five of their matches (a Grand Slam). This ensured that a Grand Slam winning team would top the table with at least 23 points \u2013 a team could lose a match but still win two bonus points and win the other four matches with four try bonus points for a maximum of 22 points. * Tiebreakers ** If two or more teams were tied on match points, the team with the better points difference (points scored less points conceded) is ranked higher. ** If the above tiebreaker failed to separate tied teams, the team that scored the higher number of total tries in their matches is ranked higher. ** If two or more teams remained tied for first place at the end of the championship after applying the above tiebreakers, the title will be shared between them. ==Fixtures== The fixtures were announced on 20 March 2019 along with the previous year's fixtures. As with 2020, no matches were scheduled on a Friday night and the final match of the tournament was scheduled for peak time. ===Round 1=== \\---- \\---- ===Round 2=== \\---- \\---- ===Round 3=== \\---- \\---- ===Round 4=== \\---- \\---- ===Round 5=== \\---- \\---- ==References== 2019 Category:2021 rugby union tournaments for national teams Category:2020\u201321 in European rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in Irish rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in English rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in Welsh rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in Scottish rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in French rugby union Category:2020\u201321 in Italian rugby union Category:February 2021 sports events in Europe Category:February 2021 sports events in the United Kingdom Category:March 2021 sports events in Europe Category:March 2021 sports events in the United Kingdom Six Nations Championship 2021 ",
