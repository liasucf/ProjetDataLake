    "text": "Spring steel is a name given to a wide range of steels used in the manufacture of springs, prominently in automotive and industrial suspension applications. These steels are generally low-alloy manganese, medium-carbon steel or high- carbon steel with a very high yield strength. This allows objects made of spring steel to return to their original shape despite significant deflection or twisting. ==Grades== Many grades of steel can be hardened and tempered to increase elasticity and resist deformation; however, some steels are inherently more elastic than others: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Common spring steel grades |- ! rowspan=2 | SAE grade (ASTM grade) ! rowspan=2 | Composition ! rowspan=2 | Yield strength ! colspan=2 | Hardness (HRC) ! rowspan=2 | Comments |- !
