The station's format is classified as Adult Album Alternative or \"Triple A.\" WTTS uses the slogan \"World Class Rock\" to describe its music mix. The station plays a variety of rock-based music from the mid-1960s to the present, including acoustic, reggae, classic rock, blues and alternative rock. In 2001, WTTS was among the first American radio stations to play music by the artists John Mayer and Norah Jones, both of whom went on to become Grammy Award winners. The station maintains studios in both downtown Indianapolis and Bloomington, its former city of license. WTTS' main transmitter is located in Trafalgar. WTTS and its sister station, WGCL (1370 AM), have been locally- owned since their inceptions by Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. ==History== WTTS began broadcasting a Big Band format in 1960 as WTTV-FM, sharing call letters with then-sister television station WTTV (channel 4). In the mid-1970s, the call letters were changed to WGTC-FM, which stood for Good Time Country to reflect its new country music format. In 1984, WGTC-FM became WTTS (the former callsign of its AM sister station), and in 1988, it changed to an AOR/CHR hybrid format under their new moniker \"The New Power 92\". Four years later, in 1992, WTTS adopted its present format. WTTS has been named \"Best Local Radio Station\" by Indianapolis alternative newspaper Nuvo multiple times since 1998.
