The film stars Purdee, John Donchak, Nathan Purdee, and Kassie DePaiva along with an ensemble cast that features YouTuber Maddi Jane and Oscar winner Lee Grant. \"Killian & the Comeback Kids\" follows a mixed-race musician who finds himself back in his struggling rural hometown after graduating from an expensive university. ==Plot== Killian returns home after his college graduation before heading off on a modest musical tour with his bandmate Ben. When Ben abandons their plan in favor of a stable A & R job Killian finds himself stuck in the once prosperous Pennsylvania steel-town. When it's announced that the major music festival that comes to town every summer is finally open to local acts, Killian gathers a group of former childhood friends and acquaintances, all of whom have returned home after college degrees, in an attempt to win the gig. Elements of the film are based on the real life withdrawal of Bethlehem Steel and creation of Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. ==Production== In August 2017 it was announced that filming had begun in Easton, Pennsylvania. The cast is made up largely of actor-musicians including members of the hit broadway and off-broadway shows Once (musical), Blue Man Group, Kinky Boots, and Spring Awakening. The film was shot entirely on location in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. Both the film's original soundtrack and score were written by The Cumberland Kids, a folk-rock act fronted Purdee and Liam Higgins. In 2018 it was announced via the film's social media that YouTube star Maddi Jane and Academy Award winner Lee Grant would also appear in the film. ==Release== During the COVID-19 crisis it was announced that Hope Runs High had acquired distribution rights for the film.https://www.playbill.com/article/killian-the-comeback- kids-with-taylor-a-purdee-kassie-depaiva-shannon-oboyle-more-eyes-summer- release A teaser for the film played in virtual cinemas ahead of 20th Century Woman: The Documentary Films of Lee Grant, a re-release series of the actress's non-fiction work. Fandango premiered the first official trailerhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPT9G9JPocg&feature;=emb_logo and two weeks later IndieWire premiered a second teaser with a new release date of September 18, 2020.https://www.instagram.com/p/CEkBNyPHGH2/https://twitter.com/IndieWire/status/1300491038734323715 That date would make Killian & the Comeback Kids one of the first new films to play in American theaters during the coronavirus outbreak, and one of the only independent films released exclusively to theaters during the crisis. Due to its \"platform release\" structure, during its first few weeks it was sometimes the only fully theatrical film opening in a given city, marking the first time in history that this happened. https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/10/6/21500485/knew-him-as-a-teen-now- chicago-native-returns-as-lead-in-new-movie-killian-the-comeback- kidshttp://www.wboc.com/story/42714938/indie-music-movie-killian-the-comeback- kids-becomes-one-of-the-only-fully-theatrical-platform-releases-in-major- cinemas With Killian & the Comeback Kids, Purdee became the youngest director of the year with a film in major US cinemas.https://www.lvpnews.com/20201010/at-the-movies-comeback-kids-charms/ ==Reception== The film has received a largely enthusiastic reaction from critics, being compared favorably to the films of Alan Parker, Greta Gerwig, and John Carney's Academy Award winning \"modern musical\" Once. https://www.lvpnews.com/20201010/at-the-movies-comeback-kids-charms/ Film Threat praised Purdee's complex portrait of the title characterhttps://filmthreat.com/reviews/killian-the-comeback-kids/.
