The artist describes The Entire City as her \"landscape album\". She further explains that she was \"illustrating places and times and alien landscapes, but warped memories too\". ==Critical reception== The Entire City garnered critical acclaim upon release. Charlotte Richardson Andrews of The Guardian gave the album a five-star review, calling it a \"stunning debut\". Simon Price wrote the record \"will haunt you long after listening\", in his review for The Independent on Sunday. Jazz Monroe, writing for Drowned in Sound, gave it an eight out of ten, opining that \"The Entire City - while slippery as a fish out of water, by all accounts - is crystal clear of ambition and concept.\" He also did another review for NME, giving it a similar score and calling it a \"triumph of art-pop splendour \u2013 equal parts terror and temerity.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Entire City. * Gazelle Twin \u2013 composition, recording, production, lyrics * Shawn Joseph \u2013 mastering * Russ Keffert \u2013 mastering * Suzanne Moxhay \u2013 artwork ==References== Category:2011 debut albums Category:Gazelle Twin albums ",
