    "text": "In five-dimensional geometry, a 5-simplex is a self-dual regular 5-polytope. It has six vertices, 15 edges, 20 triangle faces, 15 tetrahedral cells, and 6 5-cell facets. It has a dihedral angle of cos\u22121(), or approximately 78.46\u00b0. The 5-simplex is a solution to the problem: Make 20 equilateral triangles using 15 matchsticks, where each side of every triangle is exactly one matchstick. == Alternate names == It can also be called a hexateron, or hexa-5-tope, as a 6-facetted polytope in 5-dimensions. The name hexateron is derived from hexa- for having six facets and teron (with ter- being a corruption of tetra-) for having four-dimensional facets. By Jonathan Bowers, a hexateron is given the acronym hix. == As a configuration== This configuration matrix represents the 5-simplex. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, cells and 4-faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 5-simplex. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column's element occur in or at the row's element. This self- dual simplex's matrix is identical to its 180 degree rotation. \\begin{bmatrix}\\begin{matrix}6 & 5 & 10 & 10 & 5 \\\\\\ 2 & 15 & 4 & 6 & 4 \\\\\\ 3 & 3 & 20 & 3 & 3 \\\\\\ 4 & 6 & 4 & 15 & 2 \\\\\\ 5 & 10 & 10 & 5 & 6 \\end{matrix}\\end{bmatrix} == Regular hexateron cartesian coordinates == The hexateron can be constructed from a 5-cell by adding a 6th vertex such that it is equidistant from all the other vertices of the 5-cell. The Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of an origin-centered regular hexateron having edge length 2 are: :\\begin{align} &\\left(\\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{15},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{10},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{6},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{3},\\ \\pm1\\right)\\\\\\\\[5pt] &\\left(\\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{15},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{10},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{6},\\ -\\tfrac{2}\\sqrt{3},\\ 0\\right)\\\\\\\\[5pt] &\\left(\\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{15},\\ \\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{10},\\ -\\tfrac\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2},\\ 0,\\ 0\\right)\\\\\\\\[5pt] &\\left(\\tfrac{1}\\sqrt{15},\\ -\\tfrac{2\\sqrt 2}\\sqrt{5},\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0\\right)\\\\\\\\[5pt] &\\left(-\\tfrac\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{3},\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0\\right) \\end{align} The vertices of the 5-simplex can be more simply positioned on a hyperplane in 6-space as permutations of (0,0,0,0,0,1) or (0,1,1,1,1,1). These construction can be seen as facets of the 6-orthoplex or rectified 6-cube respectively. == Projected images == {| class=wikitable width=320 |320px Stereographic projection 4D to 3D of Schlegel diagram 5D to 4D of hexateron. |} == Lower symmetry forms == A lower symmetry form is a 5-cell pyramid ( )v{3,3,3}, with [3,3,3] symmetry order 120, constructed as a 5-cell base in a 4-space hyperplane, and an apex point above the hyperplane. The five sides of the pyramid are made of 5-cell cells. These are seen as vertex figures of truncated regular 6-polytopes, like a truncated 6-cube. Another form is { }v{3,3}, with [2,3,3] symmetry order 48, the joining of an orthogonal digon and a tetrahedron, orthogonally offset, with all pairs of vertices connected between. Another form is {3}v{3}, with [3,2,3] symmetry order 36, and extended symmetry 3,2,3, order 72. It represents joining of 2 orthogonal triangles, orthogonally offset, with all pairs of vertices connected between. These are seen in the vertex figures of bitruncated and tritruncated regular 6-polytopes, like a bitruncated 6-cube and a tritruncated 6-simplex. The edge labels here represent the types of face along that direction, and thus represent different edge lengths. {| class=wikitable |+ Vertex figures for truncated 6-simplexes !colspan=2|( )v{3,3,3}||colspan=2|{ }v{3,3}||{3}v{3} |- |160px |160px |160px |160px |160px |- align=center |truncated 6-simplex |truncated 6-cube |bitruncated 6-simplex |bitruncated 6-cube |tritruncated 6-simplex |} == Compound== The compound of two 5-simplexes in dual configurations can be seen in this A6 Coxeter plane projection, with a red and blue 5-simplex vertices and edges. This compound has 3,3,3,3 symmetry, order 1440. The intersection of these two 5-simplexes is a uniform birectified 5-simplex. = \u2229 . :240px == Related uniform 5-polytopes == It is first in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs, expressed by Coxeter as 13k series. A degenerate 4-dimensional case exists as 3-sphere tiling, a tetrahedral dihedron. It is first in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs, expressed by Coxeter as 3k1 series. A degenerate 4-dimensional case exists as 3-sphere tiling, a tetrahedral hosohedron. The 5-simplex, as 220 polytope is first in dimensional series 22k. The regular 5-simplex is one of 19 uniform polytera based on the [3,3,3,3] Coxeter group, all shown here in A5 Coxeter plane orthographic projections.
