    "text": "Thomas Jeremy King, Baron King of Bridgwater, (born 13 June 1933) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet from 1983\u201392, and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bridgwater in Somerset from 1970\u20132001. He was made a life peer in 2001. ==Life and career== ===Education=== King was educated at two independent schools: at St Michael's School, a former boys' preparatory school (later co-educational), in the village of Tawstock in North Devon, followed by Rugby School (Sheriff House), a boarding school for boys in Warwickshire, before attending Emmanuel College, Cambridge. ===Military service=== King was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry in 1952 and during his period of national service he was seconded to the King's African Rifles. ===Political career=== King was elected to Parliament at the 1970 Bridgwater by-election, following the death of the sitting MP, Sir Gerald Wills. King was brought into the Cabinet in 1983 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. After brief stints as the Environment Secretary and Transport Secretary, he went on to hold the posts of Employment Secretary and Northern Ireland Secretary at a time when these were high-profile roles with the potential for controversy. In October 1988, John McCann, Finbar Cullen and Martina Shanahan, all from the Republic of Ireland, were convicted at Winchester Crown Court of conspiracy to murder King near his home in Wiltshire and sentenced to 25 years in gaol. No evidence was produced in the trial that the defendants belonged to the IRA. The trio were freed after serving two and a half years after their convictions were quashed. The Court of Appeal ruled that their trial could have been prejudiced by comments made by King who said the defendants should not have the right to remain silent. The former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, criticised the Appeal Court ruling, stating: \"British justice has been betrayed by the Court of Appeal, in my opinion. Justice was done at Winchester Crown Court.\" King went on to serve as Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War. He left the Cabinet after the 1992 general election, and returned to the backbenches where he served as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Select Committee from 1994\u20132001, during which time KGB agent Vasili Mitrokhin defected to reveal 87-year-old Melita Norwood as a Soviet spy. King left the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, and was created a life peer as Baron King of Bridgwater, of Bridgwater in the County of Somerset on 9 July 2001. He now sits in the House of Lords. He serves as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party's Policy Group on National and International Security, which was set up by David Cameron in 2006. ==In popular culture== King was portrayed by Peter Blythe in the 2004 BBC production of The Alan Clark Diaries. King was the subject of a song in the satirical ITV programme Spitting Image in which he was depicted as the Invisible Man during his term as Employment Secretary. ==References== == External links == * |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:King's African Rifles officers Category:1933 births Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:British Secretaries of State for Employment Category:British Secretaries of State for the Environment Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Living people Category:Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Secretaries of State for Defence (UK) Category:Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland Category:Secretaries of State for Transport (UK) Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:UK MPs 1997\u20132001 ",
