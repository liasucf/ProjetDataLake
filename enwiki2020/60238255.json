    "text": "Magnolia is an unincorporated community in Clinch County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== An old variant name was \"Polk\". A post office called Polk was established in 1851, the name was changed to Magnolia in 1852, and the post office closed in 1861. The present name is after a grove of magnolia trees near the original town site. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Magnolia as a town in 1854; the town's municipal charter was repealed in 1995. Magnolia once held the county seat, a courthouse having built at the site in 1852. The courthouse burned to the ground in 1856, at which time the county seat was transferred to Homerville. ==References== Category:Former municipalities in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Clinch County, Georgia Category:Populated places disestablished in 1995 ",
