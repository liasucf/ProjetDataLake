    "text": "Happiness is a British sitcom with dramatic, melancholy overtones written by Paul Whitehouse and David Cummings with Whitehouse in the lead role. There were two series broadcast on BBC2, the first running in 2001 and the second in 2003. Whitehouse has stated that there will probably not be a third. ==Synopsis== Whitehouse plays Danny Spencer, a successful voice artist for a popular cartoon bear called Dexter. Spencer is trying to come to terms with the death of his wife, though much of his concern is that he finds he isn't feeling the loss as deeply as he should. Approaching his fortieth birthday he is independent and single and the programme's themes are largely bound up with the opportunities and problems that this situation creates. His friends are a disparate group, ranging from the strait-laced Terry and Rachel (Mark Heap, Fiona Allen), through the down and outs - Charlie and Sid (Johnny Vegas and Pearce Quigley), to the archetypal man in a mid-life crisis, Angus (Clive Russell). To varying degrees these friends offer Spencer inspiration and cautionary tales as to how Spencer can fill his life. ==Episodes== ===Series 1=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! # !! Title !!

Nicholas Barber thought it \"an impressive leap from catchphrase-heavy sketch comedy\" with \"topnotch supporting actors\". Many reviews singled out Johnny Vegas's performance as being the strongest among the cast. == References == ==External links== * * * Category:2001 British television series debuts Category:2003 British television series endings Category:2000s British sitcoms Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in England ",
