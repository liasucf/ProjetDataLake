Opinion polls have shown that the public preferred former President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam to hold the post once again, which was supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On 15 June, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) announced Pranab Mukherjee as its presidential candidate. There were signs of a split within the Janata Dal (United) with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar saying that \"like the other constituents, the JD (U) too will abide by the final decision on the presidential poll,\" though Shivanand Tiwari said that \"a senior and respected leader like Pranab Mukherjee, who is going into retire [from active politics] should be given a graceful send off.\" Tiwari added that \"[Mukherjee] is a very senior and a respected leader, and my personal opinion is that as he should be elected to the president's post with consensus.\" The Shiv Sena supported Mukherjee's candidates according to its spokesman Sanjay Raut. On 18 June, Kalam said he would not run in the race following statement from JDU leader Nitish Kumar and SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav that they would prefer to support Mukherjee. Following Kalam's decision, the BJP-led NDA turned to supporting Sangma. ===Unofficial list=== The final candidacy application had 45 names.

He defeated Sangma, who got 145,848 MP votes and 170,139 MLA votes for a total of 315,987 votes. Mukherjee's win was aided by cross-voting. He took the oath of office on 25 July at 11:00 in the Central Hall of the parliament building.

I have received much more than I have given.\" He also said he would \"protect, defend and preserve [the Constitution of India]. I will try to justify in a modest way as I can to be trustworthy.\" He was also congratulated by his former party colleagues Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, as well as Vice-President Hamid Ansari and BJP President Nitin Gadkari. While Sangma congratulated Mukherjee he also added: \"The process in this Presidential election has been exceptionally partisan and political. The public perception is certainly that in identification and projection of its candidate, the UPA did not genuinely build consensus and that it persuaded political parties commanding major sections of the presidential electoral college by economic and other packages...as well as inducements, threats and promises. For election to the Lok Sabha and Assembly, there is a code of conduct for free and fair elections. Such a code of conduct does not exist for presidential and vice- presidential elections...Rs. 57,000 crore were given to U.P., Rs 27,000 crore to Bihar and so many other things have happened. We are meeting a day after tomorrow to review the whole situation where this matter will come up for discussion.\" He also added that this was an opportunity lost to elect a tribal candidate as president. INC spokesman Manish Tewari responded in saying: \"Magnanimity should mark the conduct of people, who contest elections. Gritting after losing an election only endorses the proverb that grapes are sour [when you cannot reach them];\" its General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi added to criticism of Sangma's allegations that \"I think one should not talk with such a narrow vision.\" In response to cross-voting against party lines as Mukherjee had support from 98 MLAs of the INC and JDS yet won with 19 extra votes and the Sangma got only 103 votes of BJP's 119 MLAs, Karnataka BJP General Secretary Dharmendra Pradhan said that \"the party is taking this matter very seriously. The Central leadership has asked the Karnataka BJP unit to form a committee to probe this cross-voting by our MLAs. Once we get the committee's report we will take appropriate action.\" The issue also follows infighting within the Karnataka BJP that culminated in the recent appointment of Jagadish Shettar as chief minister. Anti-corruption activist group Team Anna criticised Mukherjee in saying the country now had a \"corrupt president.\" Biocon CEO Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said of the election: \"We are making a mockery of the presidential post. This is considered the highest office in our country and should be apolitical. The president should be an apolitical appointee who has the stature and integrity that can hold the political system accountable. How can persons who are in office, holding key ministerial posts, be even eligible for such a post? This is becoming a political chess game which is devaluing this very lofty post.\" ==References== ==External links== * Election Commission information on the presidential election * Official Website of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat for the Presidential Election ;Media * Presidential poll 2012: Full Coverage collected news and commentary at The Indian Express * Next President: Race for President, 2012 collected news and commentary at CNN- IBN * Coming up: Presidential Polls 2012 Category:2012 elections in India Category:Presidential elections in India Category:July 2012 events in Asia ",
