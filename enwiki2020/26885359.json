They raised \u00a3304 towards building and William Hewat, a local Blackrock member of the congregation, suggested the church be named St. Andrew's and later donated \u00a3800 enabling the purchase of Albion House in March 1896.

Patrick Caufield on the Directory of Irish Architects The foundation stone of the church was laid on 27 October 1898 and the church was opened with its first service on 5 February 1899. The building is designed in an octagonal shape fronted by a large tower containing the main entrance. The church organ was installed in 1912 with half of the money donated by Andrew Carnegie (a Scottish-American industrialist, businessman, entrepreneur and a major philanthropist). His conditions for donating the money were simple. Once the congregation had raised half of the \u00a3900 required, he would donate the rest. Under the ministry of Rev. Desmond Black a new hall was built and opened on 5 December 1959 to a cost of \u00a315,000. The hall was opened by Mrs. Scott McLeod, the wife of the United States Ambassador to Ireland at the time, and dedicated by Rt. Rev. Thomas Alexander Byers Smyth, the Moderator of the General Assembly. ==Ministers== Rev. James Snowdon (minister 1895\u20141936). Rev. James Noel Thompson (minister 1936\u20141956). Rev.
