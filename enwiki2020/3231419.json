    "text": "\"Be a Man\" is the thirteenth and last single by alternative rock band Hole before their breakup in 2002. The song was co-written by Hole members Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson with contribution from frequent guest Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins. Released in 2000 as a double A-side (the other track being from P.O.D.) this track also featured on the soundtrack to the film Any Given Sunday (1999). It was the last single by the band for ten years, until \"Skinny Little Bitch\" in 2010. ==Music video== The video (directed by Joseph Kahn) for Be a Man features a blue-haired Courtney Love with a dress in the same color in a football field, interacting with, seducing and French-kissing the game players from the film as a rain starts. It is the first Hole video not to feature Eric Erlandson (the only member remaining in the band besides Love at that point), plus it also featured her naked in the video. ==Track listing== CD single # Be a Man (radio edit) \u2013 3:18 # Be a Man (album version) \u2013 3:18 # Whatever It Takes (by P.O.D.) \u2013 4:02 US promotional CD PRCD 9166 # Be a Man (radio edit) \u2013 3:18 # Be a Man (album version) \u2013 3:18 ==References== Category:2000 singles Category:Hole (band) songs Category:Music videos directed by Joseph Kahn Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Songs written by Billy Corgan Category:Songs written by Eric Erlandson Category:Songs written by Courtney Love Category:1997 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Michael Beinhorn ",
