    "text": "Kristj\u00e1n \u00d6rn Sigur\u00f0sson (often spelled Sigurdsson) (born 7 October 1980 in Akureyri) is an Icelandic footballer who is a player-assistant manager for \u00de\u00f3r. ==Club career== He started his career at his local club \u00cdF V\u00f6lsungur H\u00fasavik, and moved to Stoke City in England as a teenager. Failing to grab a place on the first team, he returned to Iceland to play for KR. After the 2004 season he moved to SK Brann in Bergen, Norway where he plays as a defender. He showed acceptable defensive skills, but clear weaknesses in his passing game and general offensive play from his right back position. Before the 2006 season, Kristj\u00e1n was moved into the central defence, after both Ragnvald Soma and Paul Scharner were sold after the 2005 season. Kristj\u00e1n showed that he is a supreme centre back with his great speed - he was tested to be the fastest Brann player on 40 metres relay before the 2006 season. He is also considered to have great strength in the air, even though he is shorter than most players who play in his position. Some commentators have compared Kristj\u00e1n's style of play to that of Argentine centre back Roberto Ayala, although both players differ greatly in quality. Kristj\u00e1n and his teammate \u00d3lafur \u00d6rn Bjarnason started the season excellently and were nicknamed \u00d8rneredet which means Eagle's nest (both players have \u00d6rn as their middle name, and \u00d6rn/\u00d8rn is the Norwegian and Icelandic word for eagle). After several years in Bergen including the 2007 season which ended at the top position in the Norwegian Premier League, his contract with Brann ended after the 2009 season. Kristj\u00e1n retired after 2014 season. However, he came out of his retirement in 2017 after his brother, L\u00e1rus Sigur\u00f0sson, took over as manager of \u00de\u00f3r.http://fotbolti.net/fullStory.php?id=216594 ==International career== Iceland national team Kristj\u00e1n made his debut for Iceland in 2003 and went on to earn 53 caps. On 9 February 2012 he announced his retirement from international football.http://fotbolti.net/fullStory.php?action=viewStory&id;=121321 ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |V\u00f6lsungur |1996 |1. deild karla |15||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |KA |1997 |1. deild karla |15||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |rowspan=5|Stoke City |1997\u201398 |First Division |0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |1998\u201399 |Second Division |0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |1999\u20132000 |Second Division |0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2000\u201301 |Second Division |0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |rowspan=3|KA |2001 |1. deild karla |17||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||2 |- |2002 |\u00darvalsdeild |17||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !34!!3!!0!!0!!34!!3 |- |rowspan=3|KR |2003 |\u00darvalsdeild |16||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||0 |- |2004 |\u00darvalsdeild |17||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !33!!1!!0!!0!!33!!1 |- |rowspan=6|Brann |2005 |Tippeligaen |24||0||5||0||29||0 |- |2006 |Tippeligaen |24||3||4||1||28||4 |- |2007 |Tippeligaen |25||4||3||0||28||4 |- |2008 |Tippeligaen |19||1||1||0||20||1 |- |2009 |Tippeligaen |28||2||4||0||32||2 |- !colspan=2|Total !120!!10!!17!!1!!137!!11 |- |rowspan=6|H\u00f8nefoss |2010 |Tippeligaen |27||0||1||0||28||0 |- |2011 |Norwegian First Division |28||6||4||0||32||6 |- |2012 |Tippeligaen |28||3||2||0||30||3 |- |2013 |Tippeligaen |25||1||0||0||25||1 |- |2014 |Norwegian First Division |27||1||0||0||27||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !135!!11!!7!!0!!142!!11 |- |\u00de\u00f3r |2017 |1. deild karla |18||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !370!!27!!24!!1!!394!!28 |} ===International=== Source: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=9|Iceland |2003||1||0 |- |2004||8||0 |- |2005||8||2 |- |2006||2||0 |- |2007||9||0 |- |2008||6||0 |- |2009||9||2 |- |2010||5||0 |- |2011||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!52!!4 |} ==Honours== === Norway=== *Norwegian Premier League: 2007 ===Iceland=== *Icelandic Premier League: 2003 ==References== ==External links== * *KS\u00cd Profile Category:1980 births Category:Living people Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Akureyrar players Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Category:SK Brann players Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway Category:Expatriate footballers in England Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson Category:Eliteserien players Category:Norwegian First Division players Category:H\u00f8nefoss BK players Category:Association football defenders ",
