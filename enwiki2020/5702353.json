    "text": "Belgian absurdist film director Jean-Jacques Rousseau (December 16, 1946 \u2013 November 5, 2014) was a Belgian absurdist independent film director. He was born in Souvret, Belgium (Courcelles) and died in Montigny-le-Tilleul. He shot his films with very small budgets (\u20ac2000 to 2500 per film) and used unknown or non-professional actors. He called himself the director of the absurd and always fiercely protected his anonymity by masking his face during his public appearances. He shot over 50 films making him one of Belgium's most prolific film directors. His life was supposed to be the subject of a Yann Moix film, called Palme d'or, starring Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde. The project was not filmed. Moix did make, without Poelvoorde, the disastrous '. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sojcher's film ', also known as Born to Film, was selected and shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004, is dedicated to Rousseau's work as well as Max Naveaux's and Jacques Hardy's. It stars the actors Bouli Lanners and Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde. Rousseau's first few films were fairly conventional examples of the fantasy genre. However, some of them won regional awards in the 1970s (people's choice, best screenplay). A semi-permanent lack of financial resources prevented him from making technically accomplished films. However, he financed, edited, directed and acted in most of them. He was also known for carrying a gun on set and sometimes firing it to get the actors' attention. Having a fertile imagination fueled by esoteric tastes in books, his films shunned the mainstream more and more, thus becoming marginalized. He never received subsidies to finance his films. Patrick Moriau, a Belgian politician, stated once that \"If one asked me to allocate part of the Walloon Community's finances to the Committee for Film Selection, the money would undoubtedly never go into Rousseau's pockets. He may be a kind man, but his films are frankly wild and scare people.\" On the evening of July 15, 2014 after an altercation outside a caf\u00e9 between two men, he was run over by a car driven by one of the men and remained in a coma until his death later that year on November 5. ==Filmography== * Igor Yaboutich (1964) * Le Poignard maudit (1965) * Les Malfaiteurs (1966) * La Vall\u00e9e de la S\u00fbre (1966) * L'Abstrait (1968) * Le Cauchemar (1969) * Germaine Grandieu (1972) * Les Compagnons de justice (1974) * Le Reposoir (1975) * Les Immortels (1975) * Catalepsie (1976) * L'\u00e9toile du mal (1977) * Dossier R\u00e9incarnation (1977) * Les Marcheurs de la grande arm\u00e9e (1978) * The Diabolical Dr. Flak (1978) * L'histoire du cin\u00e9ma 16 (1983) * Cannes ann\u00e9e europ\u00e9enne du cin\u00e9ma (1988) * Cin\u00e9 effet (1988) * Massacre au pied de biche * Les Incubes d'Escargnole * Xeno-Zenit * Furor Teutonicus (1999) * Road Movie (2001) * Wallonie 2084 (2003) * Irkutz 88 (2004) * La Revanche du sacristain cannibale (2004) * Le Chasseur de succubes (2005) * La m\u00e9canique du rasoir (2006) * L'invasion des succubes (2006) * Rock Mend\u00e8s (2007) * Le Retour du Docteur Loiseau (2008) * Un colonial chez les Celtes (2011) * Karminsky-Grad (2011) * L'amputeur wallon (2011) * 1er juillet chez Olga (2011) * Le Couturier (2014) * Docteur Loiseau : la solution finale (2014) ==Notes== ==External links== * Official website * Rousseau on the Lausanne Underground Film and Music Festival's website * Interview * Ecran Large Interview: The Belgian Ed Wood * La Revue Toudi: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, cin\u00e9aste wallon\" par Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 Category:1946 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Belgian film directors Category:Walloon people ",
