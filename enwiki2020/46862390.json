She is well known for making history by winning both the Two Oceans and 90th Comrades marathon in the same year. W\u00f6stmann began her running career (2009) after the birth of her first child. She required a workout that could fit into her family life and busy professional career. Professionals took note of her when she positioned 15th place in only her third Comrades with a silver medal at the 2012 Comrades Marathon. Thereafter, she joined the Nedbank Running Club and trained at the University of Pretorias\u2019 High Performance Centre. Lindsey Parry coached her and Candice Attree helped her to stay focused on core- and strength training. During 2014 W\u00f6stmann placed 6th in her fourth attempt at the Comrades. After winning the Two Oceans Marathon earlier in 2015, she became the first South African woman, in 14 years, to win the prestigious Comrades Marathon. W\u00f6stmann is only the second South African woman, after Frith van der Merwe (1989) to win both the Two Oceans Marathon and Comrades Marathon in the same year. After consistent improvement of her personal best times she was named the Athletics Gauteng North's Female Athlete of 2014. Caroline W\u00f6stmann won the 2015 Two Oceans Marathon on only her second attempt. == Races == Notable past running performances: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !! Race !! Time !!
