The project is characterized by its personal themes, such as substance abuse, depression, and Rashad's personal struggles with alcohol and Xanax addiction. The album incorporates stylistic and production elements of southern hip hop, jazz, neo soul, trap music, and progressive hip hop. Musically, the project has been noted by publications for its diversity and unique sonic palate, and for being \"much more jazzy and upbeat\" than Cilvia Demo. Rashad's vocals are layered and textured. His voice throughout the record displays a \"heavy rasp\" and \"sing- songy flow\". ==Critical reception == The Sun's Tirade received critical acclaim from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 80, which indicates \"generally positive reviews,\" based on 11 reviews.http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-suns-tirade/isaiah-rashad Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork Media praised The Sun's Tirade, dubbing the album \"a complex portrait of a man in transition\", and further applauded Rashad for \"wear[ing] his anxieties\" on his sleeve. Ryan Lunn of Line of Best Fit lauded the album, saying \"while the album may have been crafted during a two-year tsunami of struggle, Isaiah Rashad still manages to sound as calm as an ocean\u2019s gentle waves; sounding so effortless has never taken so much effort.\" Andy Kellman of Allmusic similarly praised the album, citing its creativity and production as a highlight, while also directing praise at Rashad's rapping, stating \"Rashad's voice is dispirited, on the brink of disintegration\". Stephen Kearse of Consequence of Sound reviewed the album favorably, noting the album's \"experimental aesthetic\" as more refined than on Rashad's previous efforts. In a less positive review, Michael G. Barilleaux of No Ripcord found the album to be boring, stating \"Each song on this album makes its own point, but does it in exactly the same tone as the last. The end result is 17 tracks of one sound in a row, all bleeding into each other.\" ===Accolades=== The Sun's Tirade appeared on numerous end-of-year best album lists from various publications. {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
