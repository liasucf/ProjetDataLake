    "text": "The 2015\u201316 network television schedule for the five major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers prime time hours from September 2015 to August 2016. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2014\u201315 season. NBC was the first to announce its fall schedule on May 10, 2015, followed by Fox on May 11, ABC on May 12, CBS on May 13, and The CW on May 14. PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Ion Television and MyNetworkTV are also not included since the majority of both networks' schedules comprise syndicated reruns (with limited original programming on the former). The CW is not included on weekends, since it does not offer network programming. New series are highlighted in bold. All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central and Mountain times. Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.Highest-rated series is based on the annual top-rated programs list compiled by Nielsen Media Research and reported on TimBrooks.net/Ratings ==Legend== ==Sunday== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;margin-right:0;text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|Network ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|7:00 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|7:30 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|8:00 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|8:30 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|9:00 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|9:30 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|10:00 PM ! style=\"background-color:#C0C0C0;text-align:center\"|10:30 PM |- ! rowspan=\"4\"|ABC !
