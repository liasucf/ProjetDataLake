    "text": "Oxford High School (OHS) is a public high school in Oxford, Mississippi. It educates 1,210 students in grades nine through twelve. It is part of the Oxford School District. ==History== High-school students first attended public school in Oxford in 1886 when a building was erected to accommodate twelve grades of students. The University High School was the primary school in Oxford until 1963 when the town was integrated and the Oxford School District was formed. http://uhsoxford.org/history-and-highlights/ As the city of Oxford grew, so did the student population. A transition to class 5A in 2008 was followed up by a move to 6A, Mississippi's highest classification. In 2014, Oxford High School relocated and moved into a new $30 million building at 101 Charger Loop, due to the increasing number of students. The former building, which stood as the high school for nearly half a century, became the middle school for grades 7 and 8 in the district. https://www.djournal.com/news/education/new-oxford-high-school-almost- complete/article_a60fe1d5-65ad-545b-bf4c-89f6b8a8b4db.html ==Arts== Between 2007 and 2017, the OHS Theatre program was invited five times to the American High School Theater Festival at the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. ==Athletics== The Oxford Chargers have won the Mississippi High School Athletic Association's All Sports Award 4A or 5A several years, fulfilling a commitment to being a first-class athletic program.
