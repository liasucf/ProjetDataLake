    "text": "\"For a Better Day\" is a 2015 single by Swedish EDM producer Avicii featuring American singer Alex Ebert released on Universal Music. The track appears on his album Stories and on his two-track EP Pure Grinding / For a Better Day. It was written by Tim Bergling (Avicii) and Alex Ebert. A music video was produced for the song, which was filmed in Hungary. ==Music video== The official music video for \"For a Better Day\" was released on September 3, 2015. Avicii made his directorial debut by co-directing the video alongside filmmaker Levan Tsikurishvili. Filmed in the summer of 2015 in Hungary, the video stars Swedish actor Krister Henriksson and tackles the issues of child slavery and child sex trafficking. The music video for \"For a Better Day\" is split into three time streams, dealing with child sexual slavery. The video begins with a car driving into a field where men are waiting around a truck. Another man gets out of the car and one man opens a truck displaying something. The other men present look on, interested. It appears to be a purchase of something unknown. A second time stream is in black and white, and shows a boy and a girl running through a cornfield, being chased by someone who appears to be a soldier. They come out of the corn field, and take a look over the cliff, before jumping to the sea below, to the horror of the person chasing them. The third time stream shows a pair of a masked male and female in a car, who attack one of the men from the first time stream - from the \"purchase\" that was seen prior. They brand him with a word that cannot be read and then they kill him. An Asian man is forced to commit suicide with a pistol. In each case, the masked women mark the person off with a big red X across their photo on a wall. The third time stream finishes as the two masked individuals go through a riotous crowd, calling for freedom. The last individual appears to be a leader, perhaps the country's political leader. They brand him and bring him to the roof top with a noose around his neck. Just prior to shoving him over the edge to die, they reveal themselves to be the boy and girl, who had been running away in the cornfield. Finally, the first time stream is replayed - with no music and full dialog audio - we see the boy and girl being bought from the truck (shown to be full of barely dressed boys and girls), and shoved into the trunk of what appears to be the same man - the one who became the political leader. In the final scene, we see the wristwatch of the dead man - matching the unseen purchaser - and the camera pans to the man's back, which is branded with the word \"pedofilia\". ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 51 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Slovenia (SloTop50) | align=center|25 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Dance Top 40) | 60 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (R\u00e1di\u00f3s Top 40) | 24 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Single Top 40) | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 90 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 84 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 70 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Dance Top 40) | 25 |} == Certifications == ==References== Category:2015 songs Category:Avicii songs Category:Songs written by Avicii ",
