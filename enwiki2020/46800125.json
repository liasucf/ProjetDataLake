    "text": "On 25 May 2015, a mass murder took place at the Bouchoucha military base in Tunis. A Tunisian soldier, later identified as Corporal Mehdi Jemaii, who was forbidden from carrying weapons, stabbed a soldier, then took his weapon. He then opened fire on soldiers during a flag-raising ceremony, killing seven and wounding ten, including one seriously injured who died on May 31, before he was killed during an exchange of gunfire. The army claimed Mehdi Jemaii had \"family and psychological problems,\" and brushed off assertions the attack was terror-related, calling it an \"isolated incident\". The shooting happened two months after the Bardo National Museum attack. ==See also== * 2009 Fort Hood shooting * 2014 Fort Hood shooting * List of rampage killers (workplace killings) ==References== ==External links== *Base militaire Bouchoucha on Wikimapia Category:2015 crimes in Tunisia Category:2015 mass shootings Category:2015 murders in Africa Category:2010s mass shootings in Africa Category:2010s murders in Tunisia 2015 barracks shooting Category:Deaths by firearm in Tunisia Category:Mass murder in 2015 Category:Mass murder in Tunisia Category:May 2015 crimes Category:May 2015 events in Africa 2015 barracks shooting ",
