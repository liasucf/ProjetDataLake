    "text": "The BlackSheeps was a Norwegian Sami band from Nesseby. Their breakthrough came following their participation in the MGP jr, a song contest for children organised by Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. Having won MGP jr 2008 with the song Oro jaska, beana (Be Quiet, Dog) the group went on to represent Norway in the MGP Nordic 2008. They also won this competition after receiving more than half the votes. The band was recently the subject of a legal dispute over the dismissal of two band members, unpaid royalties, and the right to use the band name. However, it was ruled that the band still holds the right to the name, and former band members Alexander Touryguin and Viktoria Eriksen are not owed any money. ==Career== The group was formed in 2008 by singer Agnete Johnsen, guitarist Emelie Nilsen, bassist Alexander Touryguin, and drummer Viktoria Eriksen. On June 2, 2007, the group participated in Melodi Grand Prix Junior 2008 with their song \"Oro, Jaska, Beana.\" The group won the contest and went on to represent Norway in MGP Nordic 2008. On November 29, 2008, the group won MGP Nordic 2008 after receiving more than half of the votes. \"Oro, Jaska, Beana\" reached #1 in the Norwegian Singles Charts afterwards. In June 2010, Touryguin and Eriksen were dismissed from the band and were replaced by Nikolaj Gloppen and Simon Stenvoll Pedersen respectively. In 2011, the band participated in Melodi Grand Prix 2011, with their song \"Dance Tonight.\" They ultimately came 2nd place, losing out to the song \"Haba Haba\" by Stella Mwangi. The band became the subject of a legal dispute over the dismissal of Touryguin and Eriksen, unpaid royalties and the right to use the band name. However, it was recently ruled that the band still holds the right to the name, and Touryguin and Eriksen are not owed any money. ==Personnel== ===Current members=== * Agnete Johnsen (born July 4, 1994) \u2013 Vocals * Nikolaj Gloppen (born 1992) - Bass * Simon Stenvoll Pedersen (born 1992) \u2013 Drums * Emelie Nilsen (born March 29, 1993) \u2013 Guitar ===Former members=== * Alexander Touryguin (born October 16, 1993) \u2013 Bass * Viktoria Eriksen (born July 6, 1993) \u2013 Drums ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NOR |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Blacksheeps | * Released: 2009 * Label: MBN * Format: Digital download, CD | 4 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14.5em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NOR |- | 2008 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Oro jaska, beana\" | 1 | rowspan=\"4\"| The Blacksheeps |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2009 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Edwin\" | 14 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gold Lion\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"No Milk Today\" | \u2014 |- | 2011 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dance Tonight\" | 15 | |- |} == Trivia == In a live chat on the website of Norwegian newspaper VG, the group was confronted with the grammatical incorrectness of their name. The group said they were aware that \u201csheeps\u201d was not the correct plural form but contended that this did not matter. \u201cMany bands have spelling mistakes in their name, such as The Beatles. Remember it\u2019s just a band name, so anything works,\u201d was their reply. ==References== ==Official website== http://www.blacksheeps.no/ Category:Norwegian pop music groups Category:Melodi Grand Prix contestants Category:Melodi Grand Prix Junior contestants Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in Norway Category:Musical groups from Finnmark ",
