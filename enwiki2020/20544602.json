    "text": "Mario Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 (born 20 August 1991) is a Croatian footballer who plays as a winger for Bosnian Premier League club Zrinjski Mostar. He has amassed a total 44 youth caps for Croatia under six different age groups. ==Club career== ===Hajduk Split=== Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 began his playing career at Hajduk Split, he didn't graduate from all the youth levels of Hajduk. That decision would later affect his career. His first game for Hajduk was on 3 August 2008 against Varteks, he came on for Mladen Bartolovi\u0107 which made him at that time the youngest player ever that debuted for Hajduk on senior level with only 16 years of age. The game ended in a one all draw. Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 scored his first goal for the team in a 4\u20130 win over Birkirkara, becoming the youngest Hajduk's scorer in European competitions ever. Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 was often hailed by the media as the new Croatian star and was expected to make a significant international career. Despite his talent he did manage to find himself in the starting 11 and was mostly used as a substitute which affected him negatively. In 2008, he suffered an injury which kept him of the field for nearly 1 year. In 2009 under manager Edoardo Reja he was used more often in the first team but after suffering another injury during the winter preparations in Marbella he paused for 2 months and after Reja left the club Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 found himself again on the bench. He won the Croatian Cup in 2010. In the following season he joined Karlovac on loan but after 6 months he returned to Hajduk again to find himself with minor minutes on the field. In 2011, manager Krasimir Balakov came to Hajduk and started using young Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 as a left back. He did not prove himself to the new manager and was used again as a late substitute. In November 2011 Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 was kicked from the first team for breaking the door in the club restaurant and for disrespecting manager Balakov. He was given the status as a not needed player and was loaned to F.C. Nordsj\u00e6lland. Finally he was sold to them at the end of the season. ===Nordsj\u00e6lland=== In January 2012, Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 was loaned to Danish club Nordsj\u00e6lland for the rest of the season. He would make 11 appearances and score 1 goal during his loan spell, helping the Farum club win their first Danish Superliga championship. On 1 June 2012, Nordsj\u00e6lland confirmed the purchase of Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 from Hajduk Split who signed a three-year contract. ===Lokeren=== On 9 July 2015, it was confirmed that Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 had signed a four-year contract with Belgian club Lokeren. On 31 January 2019, it was announced, that Ti\u010dinovi\u0107, Julian Michel and \u0110or\u0111e Jovanovi\u0107 had been promoted to reserve team due to a lack of commitment. The club was in a very bad position, which with 7 matches to go was very close to relegation.Sporting Lokeren stuurt drie spelers naar de B-kern, voetbalkrant.com, 31 January 2019 On 4 March 2019, Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 got his contract terminated by mutual consent.Mario Ticinovic vertrekt bij degradant Lokeren na onderling overleg, gva.be, 4 March 2019 ===Zrinjski Mostar=== On 5 July 2019, Ti\u010dinovi\u0107 signed with Bosnian Premier League club Zrinjski Mostar on a free transfer.
