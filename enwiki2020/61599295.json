However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the opening was rescheduled several times. Initially, it was rescheduled to open at the end of May, 2020, then the opening was postponed again until July 19th. The official opening date is now officially on July 12th. It will serve as one of the three main facilities of Upopoy (meaning \"singing in a large group\"), alongside the National Ainu Park, and a memorial site on high ground on the east side of where Ainu services will be held. Exhibits will be displayed according to six principal themes: the Ainu language, Ainu history, Ainu views of the world, Ainu livelihoods (hunting, gathering, fishing, farming), Ainu lifestyles (food, clothing, shelters, music, dance), and Ainu trade and exchange with surrounding peoples, including projected \"multicultural coexistence\" in the Japan of the future. The museum's mission is \"to promote a proper understanding and awareness of Ainu history and culture in Japan and elsewhere out of respect for the dignity of the indigenous Ainu people, while contributing to the creation and development of new aspects of Ainu culture\". The new National Museum supersedes and replaces the former Ainu Museum, which closed on the 31st of March, 2018 to make way for the new museum. The former museum was nestled beside a traditional Ainu village, a kotan. This traditional village will remain in place on the west side of the grounds for visitors to experience a taste of traditional Ainu life. ==See also== * Nibutani Ainu Culture Museum * Historical Museum of the Saru River * Hakodate City Museum of Northern Peoples ==References== ==External links== * Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park // \u6c11\u65cf\u5171\u751f\u8c61\u5fb4\u7a7a\u9593 * The Foundation for Ainu Culture // \u516c\u76ca\u8ca1\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u6587\u5316\u8ca1\u56e3 Category:Museums in Hokkaido Category:Shiraoi, Hokkaido Category:Museums established in 2020 Category:2020 establishments in Japan Category:National museums of Japan Category:Ainu Category:Ethnic museums ",
