The name Lucronio was first used in a document from 965 where Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona donated the so-called place to the Monastery of San Mill\u00e1n. In the fuero from 1095 it appeared under the name Logronio, except once when it was called illo Gronio. The most broadly accepted theses seem to be those which indicate it is a late latinization by prefixing the article \"lo/illo\" to the old toponym Gronio/Gronno,I. Rodr\u00edguez y R. de Lama, Colecci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica medieval de La Rioja, vol. I, Logro\u00f1o 1979, 272-293 a word of Celtic origin which means the ford or the pass. It is believed that this name was due to the frequent use of this place to cross the Ebro river. Other historians have proposed alternative theories, such as a possible derivation from Lucus Brun or Lucus Beronius (\"Sacred place in the Beronian forest\"), but its etymology remains unknown. === Titles === John II of Castile granted it the title of \"City\" on 7 February 1431 in Palencia and ratified it on 20 February in Valladolid,Rolled leather parchment sealed with lead and the royal seal.
