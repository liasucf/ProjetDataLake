It had 1,319 inhabitants in 2010. The town got its name from its location on the island of Marstrand. Despite its small population, for historical reasons Marstrand is often referred to as a city. The town has expanded to the neighbouring island of Ko\u00f6n, which has bridge access to the mainland. ==History== Marstrand has held city privileges since 1200. The most striking feature of Marstrand is the 17th-century fortress Carlsten, named for King Carl X Gustav of Sweden. During the last quarter of the 18th century Marstrand had free port status granted by King Gustav III. Religious liberty established by the same sovereign allowed the first Swedish congregation of Jews to be established there in 1775Pages by the Swedish Tax Authority on historical congregations and Scandinavia's first synagogue to be set up in the fortress in 1780. Administratively Marstrand with immediately surrounding islands was a municipality of its own until the local government reform of 1971 when it was merged into Kung\u00e4lv Municipality. == Sports == === Sailing === Being an island makes Marstrand popular for sailing and boat races. Marstrand is the host venue for Match Cup Sweden, part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws international sailing teams to Marstrand. DS-37 boats are raced two at a time.
