    "text": "Pompeiopolis () was a Roman city in ancient Paphlagonia, identified in the early 19th century with the ruins of Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe, located near Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc, Kastamonu Province in the Black Sea Region of Turkey. The exact location is 40 km north-east of Kastamonu and a short distance across the river from modern Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc, in the valley of the G\u00f6k\u0131rmak or G\u00f6k River (, Amn\u00edas). The borders of Pompeiopolis reached the K\u00fcre mountains to the north, Ilgaz mountains to the south, Halys river to the east and P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131 valley to the west. Pompeiopolis was established together with Neoclaudiopolis as one of a number of cities founded by the Roman general and politician Pompey (Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus) and integrated into the new Roman double province of Bithynia and Pontus in the year 64 BC. It was later assigned by Mark Antony to the vassal princes of Paphlagonia, and in 6 BC, after the death of Deiotaros Philadelphos, the last king, Paphlagonia was re-integrated into the Roman Empire and placed under the governor of the province of Galatia. While the city flourished and grew during this period, it was the metropolis of Paphlagonia from the reign of Antoninus Pius until that of GallienusJulie Dalaison, \"L'atelier mon\u00e9taire de Pompeiopolis en Paphlagonie\", in Delrieux (F.) et Kayser (Fr.), \u00e9d., Hommages offerts \u00e0 Fran\u00e7ois Bertrandy, Tome 1: Des d\u00e9serts d'Afrique au pays des Allobroges, Laboratoire Langages, Litt\u00e9ratures, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Collection Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Religions, Politiques, n\u00b0 16, Chamb\u00e9ry, 2010, p. 45-81, having a civic mint in the same period, as well. During its peak in the 2nd Century AD the city was capital of the Roman Province Paphlagonia as some inscriptions on stone and coins bear the title \"Metropolis of Paphlagonia\". During the imperial era, several families from Pompeiopolis rose to the imperial aristocracy, such as those of Gaius Claudius Severus (consul suffectus in AD 112), Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus (consul in AD 146) and Gnaeus Claudius Severus (consul in AD 173) and possibly Tiberius Claudius Subatianus Aquila (praefectus of Egypt in AD 206\u2013211) and Tiberius Claudius Subatianus Proculus (governor of Numidia in AD 208\u2013210). Being a bishopric since the early 4th century at latest, Pompeiopolis received the title of autocephalous archdiocese at some time during the reign of Justinian I. Within the church province of Paphlagonia, Pompeiopolis always ranked immediately after Gangra, and above the other bishoprics. This region was conquered by the invading Turks in the late 12th century. In the 10th/11th century, Pompeiopolis was a metropolitan see until the 14th century, when this diocese was suppressed. Among the fourteen known titular holders of the Christian diocese are Philadelphus at the First Council of Nicaea, Severus of Constantinople and Theodore of Constantinople. The bishopric of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 954 Archaeological finds recovered in the past from this area are currently being exhibited or stored in the Museum of Archaeology of Kastamonu and in the local Museum and the small excavation museum at the site. In 2006, an international project for a holistic investigation of Pompeiopolis was initiated and designed by L\u00e2tife Summerer who directed extended surveys and goal-oriented excavations between 2006 and 2012 on behalf of the University of Munich and between 2012 and 2016 in cooperation with the Museum of Kastamonu.for annual excavation reports see https://kvmgm.ktb.gov.tr/TR-238493/kazi-sonuclari- toplantisi-02---35.html. Since 2017, the Kastamonu Museum together with its scientific adviser, prof. Tayyar Gurdal of the Zonguldak B\u00fclent Ecevit University, is directing the annual excavations and the conservation activities for the touristic development of the site No annual excavation reports were published since 2017, but some statements appeared in local newspapers emphasizing the focus on the conservation of the site turning the tide of the previous management. Although no remains were visible on the surface in 2005, a systematic geophysical survey over Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe detected the outline of a large city with roads, public buildings, and two theaters that were successively archaeologically investigatedJ\u00f6rg W.

The excavations in the major theatre unearthed the lowest marble seat rows as well as inscribed architraves with decorated friezes from the scaenae frons. From the inscription, it is understood that at least the stage was built around AD 150 by the evergetism of Gnaeus Claudius Severus, Marcus Aurelius' son-in-law and patron of the city. The theatre was dismantled within the 5th century. Scarce remains of an octagonal building were previously identified as the tholos of a macellum*Ruth Bielfeldt, Das Macellum von Pompeiopolis: eine neue kleinasiatische Marktanlage mit oktogonaler Tholos , in: L\u00e2tife Summerer (ed.), Pompeiopolis I: eine Zwischenbilanz aus der Metropole Paphlagoniens nach f\u00fcnf Kampagnen (2006\u20132010).

Luisa Musso of the University of Roma Tre was invited to join the archaeological mission and continued the investigation of a multiphase Roman domus at the north-eastern foot of Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe which was first discovered in 1984 by a rescue intervention of the Museum of Kastamonu and reopened in 2006-2008 by the German team Z.

The grand-house occupies a whole block within a network of orthogonal roads that organize the urban plan of this part of the city. The north-eastern blocks were built around the mid-3rd century AD and were progressively deserted since the beginning of the 7th century, with few episodes of partial reoccupation recorded until the 12th century. The grand-house is 2550 square metres wide, its layout is organized around a central peristyle and the northern side is provided by a honour court with direct accesses to wealthy reception rooms decorated with opus sectile wall revetments and mosaic floors. At least four rooms were equipped with a hypocaust heating system. The extensive excavation of the grand-house, still in progress, is accompanied by a systematic conservation program financed by the Meda Foundationhttps://www.fondazionemeda.it/, aimed at preserving and developing the monument into a public archaeological area with the involvement of local expertises and stakeholders. It is argued that Pompeiopolis was founded to take over the administrative function of the Hellenistic fortress Pimolisa located in today\u00b4s Boyabat which was abandoned and destroyed in the aftermath of the Mithridatic WarsL\u00e2tife Summerer, Revisiting Strabo 12.3.40: Along the Amnias Valley toward Pompeiopolis, Pimolisa and Sandracurgium, Geographia Antiqua 28 (2019), 113-125). The stone bridge which spans the Amnias River (G\u00f6kirmak)linked the Roman period urban center on the Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe with the opposite riverbank where the farmlands of the city were situated L\u00e2tife Summerer, The \u03b3\u03ad\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f10\u03ba \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd of Pompeiopolis and the Stone Bridge of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc, in: A. K\u00fcnzel and G. Fingerova, Proceedings of the Workshop \u201cCrossing Rivers at Byzantium and Beyond\u201d University of Vienna 2018. The city center was gradually moved to the floodplain at the southern riverbank during the early Byzantine period. The Byzantine Pompeiopolis is covered today by Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc where building remains and finds are observed in the construction pits of the underground car park of Cumhuriyet Meydan\u0131. Two hundred years after Pascale Fourcade's identification of Pompeiopolis P. Fourcade, M\u00e9moire sur Pompeiopolis ou Tash-Kouprou, Annales des voyages de la g\u00e9ographie et de l\u00b4histoire ou collection, Paris 1811, 30-58. , the massive work carried out over the last fifteen years by the University of Munich first and the Museum of Kastamonu thereafter, has finally provided a detailed archaeological knowledge of Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe that has yet to be completed and interpreted in all its historical potential. A first problem concerns precisely the location of Pompey's foundation: apart from some isolated coins of the 1st century BC, the earliest finds on the Z\u0131mb\u0131ll\u0131 Tepe date from the 2nd century AD, authorizing to rethink the location of the late Hellenistic foundation in a nearby site. ==Bibliography== *Annual excavation reports published in KST by L\u00e2tife Summerer (2006-2016): https://kvmgm.ktb.gov.tr/TR-238493/kazi-sonuclari- toplantisi-02---35.html *Christian Marek, \"Pompeiopolis\", Der Neue Pauly (DNP).
