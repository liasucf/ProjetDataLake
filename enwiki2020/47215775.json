    "text": "Saint Peleus was an early Christian martyr. An Egyptian bishop, Peleus was one of four Christians who led Mass for the persecuted Christians condemned to work in the Palestinian quarries in the wake of the Diocletianic Persecution. When the Roman emperor Galerius learned of this, he had Peleus burned alive along with the other leaders (Nilus, Elias and Patermutius), and the Christians dispersed to mines in Cyprus and Lebanon. He is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church. ==See also== *Diocletianic Persecution ==References== Category:Persecution of early Christians Category:4th-century Christian martyrs ",
