Green rejects the idea, dominant in the period after the revival of pagan witchcraft by Gerald Gardner, that witchcraft needs to be coven-based and organised around formal initiations conferred by coven leaders. She teaches that the old divinities can be encountered in the natural world, alone and without prescribed ritual forms.Hutton, pp. 337, 384.
