    "text": "Coward is the sixth studio album from Haste the Day. Solid State Records released the album on May 18, 2015. The album was released following the band's successful funding campaign via the crowdfunding website IndieGoGo, to which fans contributed more than twice the band's original goal. Coward is unique in that it features contributions from every member throughout the band's career, and is the first studio album to feature original vocalist Jimmy Ryan since the band's 2005 release When Everything Falls. == Critical reception == Awarding the album three and a half stars from Alternative Press, Tyler Sharp writes, \"Coward tends to lack an overall sense of cohesion, creating a slight disconnect for the listener, yet doesn\u2019t hold the band back from creating arguably some of their most profound material to date, in bouts of progressive, titan metalcore.\" Timothy Estabrooks, giving the album three and a half stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, writes, \"Unfortunately, the results are as mixed as the band itself ... Foundationally, Coward is as solid as you would expect from a veteran band.\" Indicating in a four star review by HM Magazine, Taylor Boyce says, \"It's as aggressive as any of their previous releases, and their keen ability to craft well-written songs with an ear for the listener solidifies this release...and the band...as true marks of talent.\" Rating the album four stars at Indie Vision Music, Brody Barbour describes, \"With multiple listens, however, I soon discovered this album plays out best as a greatest hits album, with all the best parts of Haste the Day placed within.\" Jesse Striewski, awarding the album three stars by New Noise Magazine, says, \"Like any Haste The Day album, this won\u2019t appeal to everyone; but those who have been waiting for these guys to release new music should be able to appreciate it.\" Assigning the album nine and a half stars at Jesus Wired, Topher P. states, \"Coward is still a phenomenal effort with minimal flaws, if any at all.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == ===Haste the Day=== * Stephen Keech \u2013 lead vocals * Jimmy Ryan \u2013 lead vocals * Brennan Chaulk \u2013 rhythm guitar, clean vocals * Scotty Whelan \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Dave Krysl \u2013 lead guitar * Jason Barnes \u2013 lead guitar on \"Accept\" * Mike Murphy \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Giuseppe Capolupo \u2013 drums, percussion * Devin Chaulk \u2013 drums on \"Accept\" ===Additional musicians=== * Vocals by Janell Belcher of The Ember Days * Background vocals by Colin Baney, Marcus Baney, David Dove, Ryan Green, Corey Joseph, Stephen Keech, Jeff Keys, Jedidiah Lachmann, Sam Lowell, Logan Mackenzie and Alex Ramirez ===Production=== * Producer \u2013 Stephen Keech * Recording \u2013 Dirty Denim Studio, Nashville, TN / Threshold Studios, Indianapolis, IN * Engineer \u2013 Jason Belcher, Seiji Itaru Inouye, Lane Johnson, Stephen Keech and Brian Thorburn * Mixing \u2013 Matt Goldman at Glow in the Dark, Atlanta, GA * Mastering \u2013 Sam Moses * Management \u2013 Mark LaFay ===Artwork and design=== * Artwork \u2013 Ryan Scott * Cover photo \u2013 Marcus Baney == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2015) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} == References == Category:2015 albums Category:Haste the Day albums Category:Solid State Records albums ",
