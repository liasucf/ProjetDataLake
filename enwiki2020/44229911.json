His death focused the attention given to the safety of Guatemalan journalists. == Personal history == At the time of his murder, Luis de Jes\u00fas Lima was 68 years old. He was buried in the general cemetery in Zacapa. == Career == Luis de Jes\u00fas Lima started his career as a journalist in February 1968 and was well into his fourth decade in the profession.

The station is located in La Reforma neighborhood. Lima had just arrived to work and had not yet gotten out of his car. Two men on motorcycles drive past and shot into the car. He was found to have been hit by two bullets; one in his head and the other in his thorax. He was dead at the scene of the crime. Several motivations were under investigation. The police ruled out robbery as his wallet was still with his body. The police originally believed his murder might have been politically motivation. Another reason may have been a discussion that took place between Lima and these men in the vicinity of a school. And still another point of investigation centered around an altercation Lima may have had with the men at a gas station minutes before his death. His death has also come along with other murders of Guatemalan journalists. == Context and impact == Lima was the third journalist murdered in Guatemala in 2013.

Reporters Without Borders issued a joint statement with Cerigua Journalists' Oberservatory saying, \"The safety of journalists should be a priority for the authorities. The motive for Lima\u2019s murder is not yet known and we urge the investigators not to rule out any hypothesis, including a possible link to his work as a journalist.\" Irena Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said \"Letting violence against journalists go unpunished is detrimental to media professionals\u2019 ability carry out their work; it undermines both freedom of expression and freedom of information.\" Freedom House has called on the authorities in Guatemala to better protect its journalists. A spokesperson issued the following statement, \"Freedom of the press is foundational for the democratic development of any society, yet press freedom will not flourish when violence is directed against journalists. In Central America such incidences of violence are becoming tragically commonplace, and the Guatemalan government must take serious, credible, and immediate steps to safeguard press freedom. Journalists must be free to report \u2013 safely \u2013 on the most pressing issues affecting the country.\" == See also == * List of journalists killed in Guatemala == References == Category:2013 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Guatemala Category:Guatemalan journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Journalists killed in Guatemala Category:Murdered journalists Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
