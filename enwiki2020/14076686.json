    "text": "Mutant Chronicles is a 2008 British-American science fiction action-horror film, loosely based on the role-playing game of the same name. The film was directed by Simon Hunter, and stars Thomas Jane and Ron Perlman. It was released throughout Europe in 2008, followed by a North American VOD on March 27, 2009, and a theatrical release for selected cities on April 24, 2009. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 4, 2009. ==Plot== The story is set in the year 2707.The world is loosely based on that of the Mutant Chronicles role-playing game, where many technologies are steam powered and mankind has exhausted Earth's natural resources. The protagonists must battle against mutated humans that were accidentally unleashed. The plot revolves around a \"machine\" which came from space 10,000 years ago. The \"machine\" mutates people into barely intelligent killing drones, known as \"mutants\", that drag new victims to the machine for conversion. Sealed away thousands of years ago by human tribes, the machine is accidentally uncovered during a large battle in Eastern Europe between two of the four corporations that now rule the world. Within six weeks the world is almost completely conquered by the mutant gangs. Some of the population has been evacuated to Mars, but millions remain on the doomed Earth. A group of soldiers are assembled to take another ancient device to the heart of the machine in an attempt to destroy it in a suicide mission. In return, their loved ones receive coveted tickets to Mars. En route their spaceship is shot down by a kamikaze airship piloted by a mutant. The group is forced to battle through the mutants in tunnels to reach the machine, hoping to save the last of humanity. In their attempt to reach the machine most die, with Mitch being partially transformed into a mutant and Brother Samuel being fully transformed. Mitch is able to halt his own transformation, but is forced to kill Brother Samuel. Mitch, being the last survivor, is ultimately successful in activating the ancient device, causing the machine (which was actually part of a spacecraft) to blast off into space. A dying and mutated Samuel tells him to \"have faith\" as Mitch jumps from the slowly ascending rocket, landing in an underground lake beneath the rocket. Crawling onto land he sees the rocket disappear into the sky, realizing he is the prophesied savior of mankind, despite not believing in a god. Grievously wounded and partially mutated, he lights a final crooked cigarette. ==Cast== *Thomas Jane as Sergeant John Mitchell \"Mitch\" Hunter *Ron Perlman as Brother Samuel *Devon Aoki as Corporal Valerie Chinois Duval *Benno F\u00fcrmann as Lieutenant Maximillian Emile von Steiner *Sean Pertwee as Nathan Rooker *John Malkovich as Constantine *Anna Walton as Severian *Luis Echegaray as Corporal Jesus \"El Jesus\" de Barrera *Shauna Macdonald as Adelaide *Tom Wu as Corporal Juba Kim Wu *Steve Toussaint as Captain John Patrick McGuire *Roger Ashton- Griffiths as Science Monk *Curtis Walker as Bigboy ==Critical reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18% based on , with a weighted average rating of 3.5/10.
