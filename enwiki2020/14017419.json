The stores stock 3,700 articles contained within 300-1,000 square meters of sales area. Kiwi has about 8000 employees. In addition to premium brands it also carries the private label First Price. In Denmark, Kiwi is a joint venture between NorgesGruppen and Dagrofa. In Denmark Kiwi primarily operates in Jutland and Funen. It has only two stores in other locations. In June 2010 it opened its first store in the capital region. It is located in the \u00d8sterbro region of Copenhagen. Kiwi was owned and operated by Norwegian businessman Per-Erik Burud, who in July 2011 died in a boating accident. After Burud's death, Jan Paul Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y was constituted as new leader of the chain. Especially conspicuous is their corporate-color which is green. The company is a participant in the N\u00f8kkellhullsmerket (\"keyhole mark\") program. This is an initiative backed by health and nutrition institutions throughout Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, which aims to mark certain food items as healthy. In April 2017 it was announced that all stores in Denmark would cease to operate under the Kiwi brand. Thirty stores would continue under the SPAR or Meny brands. ==References== ==External links== * Norwegian Website * Danish Website Category:Supermarkets of Norway Category:Retail companies established in 1979 Category:Supermarkets of Denmark Category:Norwegian brands Category:Norwegian companies established in 1979 ",
