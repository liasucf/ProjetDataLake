    "text": "First edition (Faber and Faber, 1957) The Hawk in the Rain is a collection of poems by the British poet Ted Hughes. Published in 1957, it was Hughes's first book of poetry. The book received immediate acclaim in both England and America, where it won the Galbraith Prize.\"The Private Man,\" The Economist November 22, 2007 Many of the book's poems imagine the real and symbolic lives of animals, including a fox, a jaguar, and the eponymous hawk. Other poems focus on erotic relationships, and on stories of the First World War, Hughes's father being a survivor of Gallipoli. The book, dedicated to Hughes' first wife Sylvia Plath, is a collection of 40 poems. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Plath considered her husband's poetry \".. the most rich and powerful since that of Yeats and Dylan Thomas\". She had typed out almost all his poems and submitted them, in this collection, to a competition for a first book of poems being run by the Poetry Centre of the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York. In February 1957 the judges, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Marianne Moore, awarded the first prize (publication by Harper and Row) to Hughes. Marianne Moore wrote: \"Hughes's talent is unmistakable, the work has focus, is aglow with feeling, with conscience; sensibility is awake, embodied in appropriate diction.\" Hughes rejected the Latinate and courtly iamb in favour of bludgeoning trochees and spondees. The strong alliteration, onomatopoeia, and hyperbole gave his poems an impact not heard in English verse since the demise of Middle English. ==Contents == Earth-Moon: A Ted Hughes Website # The Hawk in the Rain # The Jaguar # Macaw and Little Miss # The Thought-Fox # The Horses # Famous Poet # Song # Parlour-Piece # Secretary # Soliloquy of a Misanthrope # The Dove-Breeder # Billet-Doux # A Modest Proposal # Incompatibilities # September # Fallgrief's Girl-Friends # Two Phases # The Decay of Vanity # Fair Choice # The Conversion of the Reverend Skinner # Complaint # Phaetons # Egg-Head # The Man Seeking Experience Enquire His Way of a Drop of Water # Meeting # Wind # October Dawn # Roarers in a Ring # Vampire # Childbirth # The Hag # Law in the Country of the Cats # Invitation to the Dance # The Casualty # Bayonet Charge # Griefs for Dead Soldiers # Six Young Men # Two Wise Generals # The Ancient Heroes and the Bomber Pilot # The Martyrdom of Bishop Farrar ==References== Category:English poetry collections Category:1957 poetry books Category:Poetry by Ted Hughes Category:Faber and Faber books ",
