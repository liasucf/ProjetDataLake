    "text": "The Peruvian racket-tail (Ocreatus peruanus) is a species of hummingbird. It is found on the east slope of the Andes in Ecuador and northeastern Peru. It previously was considered conspecific with the white-booted racket-tail and the rufous-booted racket-tail, together called the booted racket-tail. In fact, many taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to lump the species together. ==Description== Peruvian Racket-tails have pronounced sexual dimorphism (sexes have different plumage). Only the male has elongated racket-shaped outer rectrices (tail feathers) that are about 7 to 7.5 cm long. These tail feathers have bare shafts with long terminal oval shaped flags that have blunted ends. In perching birds, the rackets are held parallel with a slight overlap of the flags. Both sexes are shining green above with a small white postocular spot. The underparts of the male are also shining green with an iridescent green throat patch that can be seen in good light. The female has white underparts with many large dark green spots, and its black tail has white tips. Both sexes have cinnamon colored leg puffs (booties), although the male's are longer and fluffier. Female in eastern Ecuador ==References== Peruvian racket-tail Category:Birds of the Peruvian Andes Peruvian racket-tail Peruvian racket-tail ",
