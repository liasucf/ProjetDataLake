    "text": "Whiplash is an American thrash metal band, formed in 1984 in Passaic, New Jersey. The band has been centered around guitarist and vocalist Tony Portaro, who is the only constant member of the lineup. Despite never achieving major success, Whiplash has been recognized as one of the first East Coast thrash metal bands in the 1980s, and they are also notable for featuring drummer Tony Scaglione, who had been in and out of Whiplash since its inception and was a temporary fill-in for Dave Lombardo in Slayer on the latter's Reign in Blood tour. ==History== The original lineup of Tony Portaro, Tony Scaglione and Tony Bono recorded their debut album Power and Pain for Roadrunner Records in 1986. Joe Cangelosi replaced Tony Scaglione that same year when the latter left for a seven-week tour with Slayer. Joe Cangelosi recorded Ticket to Mayhem in 1987 with the two Tonys. In 1989, Glenn Hansen joined the band as the new singer for the album titled Insult to Injury. The band split up due to business reasons, but reunited in 1995 after Portaro and Scaglione joined forces in a revamped lineup of Billy Milano's M.O.D. for a European tour. Whiplash released two further albums, Cult of One and Sit, Stand, Kneel, Prey before the three Tonys recorded a final album together in 1998, Thrashback. Bassist Tony Bono died in 2002 after suffering a heart attack, at the age of 38. In 2009, founding member Tony Portaro and Joe Cangelosi reformed the band, adding bassist Rich Day, and recorded Unborn Again, released in September 2009. Whiplash played many festivals in Europe that year including Wacken Open Air in Germany, Jalometalli festival in Finland and shows in Italy, Norway, Mexico and Colombia. In 2010, the band took a limited break due to personal legal reasons. In the start of December 2010, Tony Portaro announced the return of their original drummer, Tony Scaglione, to the band. They recruited New York bassist David DeLong, a Pennsylvania-Dutch native, with music influences from the 80's NY Metal/Hardcore/Punk scene. However, after two weeks, Tony Scaglione announced personal scheduling issues became his priority. With the help of Ben Ward of Orange Goblin and Nathan Perrier of Alabaster Suns, Labrat and Capricorns, Dan \"Loord\" Foord (SikTh) entered into the band. Whiplash launched their POWER AND PAIN 2011 tour with dates in Greece and Italy in April 2011. Following performances at HELLFEST (France) and Portaro's hometown of Clifton, New Jersey, Whiplash headlined at the San Francisco festival SLAUGHTER BY THE WATER 2. After returning from California, they began writing new material, and held another New Jersey performance before finishing their tour with three shows in Chile. In January 2012, Whiplash headlined thrash metal shows in Philadelphia and New Jersey before embarking on the heavy metal cruise 70000 TONS OF METAL aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Majesty Of The Seas. In March and April, Whiplash performed at shows in the Netherlands, and at the Keep It True Festival in Germany and the SWR Barroselas Metalfest in Portugal. The band also headlined at the Convivencia Rock festival in Pereira, Colombia in July 2012. On October 10, 2015, Whiplash announced they were reuniting with original drummer Tony Scaglione. However, this reunion did not last for long, and the band replaced him with Tom Tierney, who was later replaced by former Overkill drummer Ron Lipnicki. In July 2018, Whiplash signed with Metal Blade Records and they are currently working on a new album. The band has also been working on a new EP, entitled Old School American Way. ==Band members== Tony Portaro, 2015 Current * Tony Portaro \u2013 lead vocals, guitars (1984\u20131999, 2007\u2013present) * David DeLong \u2013 bass, backing vocals (2011\u2013present) * Ron Lipnicki \u2013 drums (2018\u2013present) Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:15 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:100 top:0 right:0 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1984 till:09/01/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:5 start:1985 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1985 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:Guitars value:green legend:Guitars id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_album LineData = layer:back color:studio at:03/01/1986 at:10/02/1987 at:08/14/1989 at:03/26/1996 at:12/08/1997 at:10/05/1998 at:09/08/2009 BarData = bar:Orosz text:\"Mike Orosz\" bar:Hansen text:\"Glenn Hansen\" bar:Gonzo text:\"Rob Gonzo\" bar:Portaro text:\"Tony Portaro\" bar:Conditi text:\"Warren Conditi\" bar:Burns text:\"Pat Burns\" bar:Harding text:\"Rob Harding\" bar:Bono text:\"Tony Bono\" bar:Preziosa text:\"James Preziosa\" bar:Day text:\"Rich Day\" bar:DeLong text:\"David DeLong\" bar:Scaglione text:\"Tony Scaglione\" bar:Cangelosi text:\"Joe Cangelosi\" bar:Candella text:\"Bob Candella\" bar:Foord text:\"Dan Foord\" bar:Zeleny text:\"Charlie Zeleny\" bar:Tierny text:\"Tom Tierny\" bar:Lipnicki text:\"Ron Lipnicki\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,4) bar:Portaro from:07/01/1984 till:01/01/1989 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Portaro from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Portaro from:01/01/2009 till:end color:Vocals width:3 bar:Orosz from:01/01/1984 till:07/01/1984 color:Vocals bar:Hansen from:01/01/1989 till:01/01/1991 color:Vocals bar:Gonzo from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1997 color:Vocals bar:Conditi from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1998 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Portaro from:01/01/1984 till:01/01/1991 color:Guitars bar:Portaro from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1999 color:Guitars bar:Conditi from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1998 color:Guitars bar:Portaro from:01/01/2009 till:end color:Guitars bar:Burns from:01/01/1984 till:03/01/1984 color:Bass bar:Harding from:03/01/1984 till:07/01/1984 color:Bass bar:Bono from:07/01/1984 till:01/01/1991 color:Bass bar:Bono from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 color:Bass bar:Preziosa from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1998 color:Bass bar:Day from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2011 color:Bass bar:DeLong from:01/01/2011 till:end color:Bass bar:Scaglione from:01/01/1984 till:01/01/1987 color:Drums bar:Scaglione from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/1997 color:Drums bar:Scaglione from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 color:Drums bar:Scaglione from:12/01/2010 till:01/06/2011 color:Drums bar:Scaglione from:10/10/2015 till:01/01/2016 color:Drums bar:Cangelosi from:01/01/1987 till:01/01/1991 color:Drums bar:Cangelosi from:01/01/2009 till:12/01/2010 color:Drums bar:Candella from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1998 color:Drums bar:Foord from:01/06/2011 till:06/03/2014 color:Drums bar:Zeleny from:06/03/2014 till:10/10/2015 color:Drums bar:Tierny from:01/01/2016 till:01/01/2018 color:Drums bar:Lipnicki from:01/01/2018 till:end color:Drums ==Discography== ===Demo=== *Fire Away (1984) *Thunderstruk (1984) *Looking Death in the Face (1985) *Untitled 3 Track demo (1985) ===Full length=== *Power and Pain (1986) *Ticket to Mayhem (1987) *Insult to Injury (1989) *Cult of One (1996) *Sit Stand Kneel Prey (1997) *Thrashback (1998) *Unborn Again (2009) ===EPs=== *Old School American Way (TBA) == Notes == Category:American thrash metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from New Jersey Category:Music and politics Category:Musical groups established in 1984 ",
