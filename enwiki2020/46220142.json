    "text": "\u03b2 Microscopii, Latinised as Beta Microscopii, is a faint, white-hued star in the constellation Microscopium. It is close to the lower limit of stars that are visible to the naked eye having an apparent visual magnitude of +6.04. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 6.76 mas as seen from Earth, this star is located roughly 480 light years from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an extinction factor of 0.19 due to interstellar dust. This is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A2 Vn, where 'n' indicates nebulous absorption lines caused by fast rotation. It is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 275 km/s. The star has about 2.2 times the radius of the Sun and it is radiating 66 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 8,586 K. ==References== Category:A-type main-sequence stars Category:Microscopium Microscopii, Beta Category:Durchmusterung objects 198529 102989 7979 ",
