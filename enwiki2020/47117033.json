    "text": "520px The online music magazine Pitchfork Media began awarding songs Best New Track (BNT) in its track reviews in 2009 as part of its Best New Music section. A total of 98 tracks, which the source reviewed album-only cuts, singles, remixes, a-sides and b-sides of singles and so forth, were given the title in its first year. All BNTs have a rating of 8/10 or higher, although not all tracks awarded 8/10 were titled BNT. Only two tracks were awarded a perfect 10/10 score in 2009: \"While You Wait for the Others\" (Grizzly Bear) and \"What Would I Want? Sky\" (Animal Collective). This list does not contain tracks that were included on Pitchfork's best of year lists but did not receive BNT. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Track !Artist !Rating !Date of review !Album |- |\"Knotty Pine\" |Dirty Projectors and David Byrne |8 |January 15 |Dark Was the Night |- |\"Sunlight\" |tUnE-yArDs |8 |February 23 |Bird-Brains |- |\"The Breeze/My Baby Cries\" |Bill Callahan (original song by Kath Bloom) |8 |rowspan=2|February 25 |Loving Takes This Course |- |\"Black Lake\" |Real Estate |8 |Real Estate |- |\"My Girls\" |Animal Collective |9 |February 27 |Merriweather Post Pavilion |- |\"Wind Phoenix\" |Cymbals Eat Guitars |8 |March 2 |Why There Are Mountains |- |\"Young Hearts Spark Fire\" |Japandroids |9 |March 4 |Post-Nothing |- |\"Glass\" |Bat for Lashes |8 |March 5 |Two Suns |- |\"1901\" |Phoenix |8 |March 8 |Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix |- |\"Skeletons\" |Yeah Yeah Yeahs |8 |March 13 |It's Blitz! |- |\"Is She There?\" |Nodzzz |8 |March 18 |Nodzzz |- |\"Rain On\" |Woods |8 |March 27 |Songs of Shame |- |\"It Gets Your Body Movin'\" |Suckers |8 |March 31 | - |- |\"Daniel\" |Bat for Lashes |9 |April 6 |Two Suns |- |\"Die Slow\" |Health |8 |April 10 |Get Color |- |\"my life, my swag\" |jj |8 |April 13 |\"jj n\u00b0 1\" |- |\"Stillness Is the Move\" |Dirty Projectors |9 |April 16 |Bitte Orca |- |\"Freeway\" |Kurt Vile |8 |April 17 |Constant Hitmaker |- |\"Raindrops\" |Basement Jaxx |8 |April 24 |Scars |- |\"Lisztomania\" |Phoenix |8 |April 27 |Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix |- |\"Young Adult Friction\" |The Pains of Being Pure at Heart |8 |April 29 |The Pains of Being Pure at Heart |- |\"Velvet\" (Gang Gang Dance remix) |Remix of a song originally by The Big Pink |8 |May 4 |A Brief History of Love (Limited edition) |- |\"I Want You to Know\" |Dinosaur Jr. |8 |May 7 |Farm |- |\"Moth's Wings\" |Passion Pit |8 |May 11 |Manners |- |\"Two Weeks\" |Grizzly Bear |9 |May 13 |Veckatimest |- |\"Version (Test Mixxx)\" |patten |8 |May 14 | - |- |\"While You Wait for the Others\" |Grizzly Bear |10 |rowspan=2|May 22 |Veckatimest |- |\"Chi Don't Dance\" |BBU |8 |Fear of a Clear Channel Planet |- |\"Northern Lights\" |Bowerbirds |8 |May 26 |Upper Air |- |\"Bode\" |Julianna Barwick |8 |May 27 |Florine |- |\"Dream City\" |Free Energy |8 |May 28 |Stuck on Nothing |- |\"Divinations\" |Mastodon |9 |May 29 |Crack the Skye |- |\"It Ain't Gonna Save Me\" |Jay Reatard |8 |June 1 |Watch Me Fall |- |\"Psychic City (Voodoo City)\" |Y\u25b3CHT |9 |June 2 |See Mystery Lights |- |\"Love the Nite Away\" (Tiedye remix) |Remix of a track originally by DJ Kaos |9 |June 4 | - |- |\"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell\" (Wallpaper. remix) |Remix of a song originally by Das Racist |8 |June 8 | - |- |\"Dreamer\" |Tiny Vipers |8 |June 15 |Life on Earth |- |\"So Insane\" |Discovery |8 |June 17 |LP |- |\"Valiant Brave\" |Ganglians |8 |June 18 |Monster Head Room |- |\"Beggar's Bowl\" |Polvo |8 |June 24 |In Prism |- |\"Tunguska\" |Cymbals Eat Guitars |8 |June 26 |...And the Hazy Sea/Tunguska |- |\"Be My Girl\" |Smith Westerns |8 |June 29 |The Smith Westerns |- |\"Keep It Goin' Louder\" |Major Lazer featuring Nina Sky and Ricky Blaze |9 |June 30 |Guns Don't Kill People...
