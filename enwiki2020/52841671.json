From then the team competed in many seasons with a Ducati Superstock 1000 including a maiden race win with Tristan Palmer. They also entered the British Superbike class and every race improved their bike and results. In 2015 the team signed a deal with Lloyds British to compete in the Superbike class with Czech contender Jakub Smr\u017e, but after several good results, Smrz had a crash at the Snetterton Circuit, meaning he would be out. American John Hopkins took his place as a replacement rider and took the team to a record result at the final round of the 2015 season of 3rd place. In 2016 the team signed Danny Buchan but after a successful start to the year in testing, things didn't work during the start of the season. The team's replacement rider was Scotsman Stuart Easton, but he also dropped out, and Ducati test rider Alessandro Polita was the final rider of the season. For 2017 the team signed American John Hopkins to compete in the British Superbike class.
