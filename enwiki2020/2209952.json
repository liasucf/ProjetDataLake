    "text": "Biograd na Moru ( or ), commonly shortened to simply Biograd, is a town in northern Dalmatia, Croatia and is significant for being the former capital of the medieval Croatian Kingdom. Biograd is administratively part of the Zadar County. It is located on the Adriatic Sea coast, overlooking the island of Pa\u0161man, on the road from Zadar and Suko\u0161an towards Vodice and \u0160ibenik. Biograd na Moru is known as a tourist resort, with the first tourists arriving in the 1920s from Czechoslovakia, and its first hotel was built in 1935. ==Etymology== The town's native Croat name fully translates as \"the white town on the sea\". The name Biograd is a compound literally meaning \"white city\" and etymologically corresponds to several other toponyms spread throughout the Slavic-speaking world: Beograd (Belgrade), Belgorod, Bia\u0142ogard etc. The name was first mentioned in the 10th century as a town founded by the Croats. It was rendered in Latin as Alba Maritima, meaning \"the white maritime (one)\". ==Geography== Biograd na Moru is located 28 km south from the county capital, Zadar. It is located on small peninsula surrounded by two little bays: Soline on south and Bo\u0161ana on north; in front of it are the islands Planac and Sveta Katarina. Average temperature in January is 7.3 \u00b0C and 23.9 \u00b0C in July. The only settlement in the Town is Biograd na Moru itself. == History == Ruins of Biograd from 1487. ===Early medieval=== A three naved basilica was built on the basis of an older 6th century church during the reign of duke Branimir in the 9th century. The building later became the cathedral of the Bishop of Biograd. One of the very significant characteristics of this building are the semi-circular buttresses, found only on the buildings in Croatia at that time.Nikolina Uroda, Biogradska katedrala, Muzej hrvatskih arheolo\u0161kih spomenika-Split, Zavi\u010dajni muzej Biograd na Moru pp. 22 The city is first mentioned as Belgradon in the mid-10th century chronicle De Administrando Imperio as one of the populated towns in \"christened Croatia\". It was the centre of the county (\u017eupanija) of Sidraga. There are allegations that the bishopric was founded during this time based on a charter whose authenticity is disputed. Thus, this is not universally accepted by historians. During the wars between Croatia and the Republic of Venice in 1000, the town was captured for a brief time by the Venetians. During this time the Biograd was mentioned as a castle, and its citizens subsequently swore an oath of fealty to the Doge, who installed Vitale Michiel as a governor.http://templari.hr/strucni- radovi/ZNANSTVENI%20RAD%20-%20Detaljna%20povijest%20grada%20Biograda%20na%20Moru.pdf During the 1050s, it is for the first time mentioned as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alba Maritima, a suffragan of Salona, until its 1226 suppression, when its territory was merged into the nearby Diocese of Skradin. The city flourished during this time. King Peter Kre\u0161imir IV founded the monasteries of St. John the Evangelist and St. Thomas in 1059 and 1066, both of them being three-naved basilicas. The nearby 9th century Cathedral was also expanded with a belltower and by adding the southern part of the walls. The function of prior (head of city elected by its commune in Dalmatia) is attested. The city was also a major port during the latter half of the 11th century. During the succession crisis in 1096, the Norman princess Felicia of Sicily disembarked in the port of the city to marry the Hungarian king Coloman. It was the city where Coloman of Hungary was crowned in 1102 by the Biograd bishop Bono, as the crown of Croatia was passed to the Hungarians. In the subsequent years its rule was exchanged between Venice and the \u00c1rp\u00e1d family. At this point, the city is mentioned as a \"royal city\" (urbe regia) for the first time in surviving documents. The expanded name Belgradum supra mare (Biograd na Moru) is also for the first time attested during this period. Around the year 1115, the city was acquired by the Republic of Venice, which then tore down the city walls towards the sea, so it would \"for all times (per tutti tempi) remain in the possession of the Serenissima\". It was eventually reconquered by Stephen II of Hungary in 1124. In 1125, after it again fell to the Venetian hands, it was destroyed on the orders of the Venetian doge because of it vicinity to Zadar. According to the Historia Ducum Veneticorum, only the citizens of Biograd na Moru \"... dared resist the doge and his army ...\", during his reconquest of Dalmatia but \"... their city was razed to its foundations.\" pp. 204 The city core, consisting of the royal palace, ban's court, as well as monasteries and churches, was plundered. Much of the local monks fled to the nearby islands of Tkon and Pa\u0161man and the Biograd bishopric was abolished; its territories were added to the Bishopric of Zadar. The population, along with the bishop, moved to Skradin. A 15th-century drawing that depicts the ruins of Biograd also attest the bishop's palace beside the cathedral, as well as stone buildings and residences. It was the capital of most Croatian regnants such as Stephen Dr\u017eislav and Peter Kre\u0161imir IV, as well as an important religious place. ===Later history=== In 1202, when the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade occupied Zadar, many of its citizens took refuge in Biograd, then noted as Jadra Nova (\"New Zadar\"). Two years later, the most of them left back to Zadar, after which the city was also referred to as Jadera Vetula (\"Old Zadar\") or Zara vecchia in Italian translation.N. Klai\u0107, I. Petricioli, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Pro\u0161lost Zadra - knjiga II, Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976, page 181. During the 13th and 14th century the city was run by the dukes of Cetina, the Knights Templar of Vrana and the dukes of Bribir the \u0160ubi\u0107es. It was acquired by the Venetian Republic in 1409 and would remain its property until its downfall in 1797. During the Venetian-Turkish wars, the city was gravely damaged, and on two occasions, in 1521 and in 1646, it was destroyed and burned. In the 16th and 17th century, the Croatian militia formed in Biograd and had much involvement in the wars against the Turks. In recent history, the Serbian forces inflicted considerable damage by long-range bombardment in the period 1991-1993 during the Croatian War of Independence. ==Population== The town and the settlement itself have a population of 5,569 (2011 census). The majority are Croats (95%). ==Gallery== File:Biograd_1.JPG|Biograd na Moru waterfront ==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities== Biograd na Moru is twinned with: * Kressbronn am Bodensee, Germany, since 2010 * Slovenske Konjice, Slovenia, since 2019 ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Biograd.info Category:Former capitals of Croatia Category:Cities and towns in Croatia Category:Populated coastal places in Croatia Category:Populated places in Zadar County ",
