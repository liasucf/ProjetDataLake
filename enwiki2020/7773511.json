It was written by band members Alesha Dixon, Su-Elise Nash, and Sabrina Washington along with Mushtaq for their debut album, Lickin' on Both Sides (2001). Rather than the album version, Grant Nelson's Bump & Flex Remix of the song was chosen as the fourth single from the album. It reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. The music video features the group dancing on a beach scene, moving into a shack for Alesha's rap. A Steel Drum player is shown throughout the video, highlighting the Caribbean feel of the song. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (2002) !Peak position |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |39 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Charts (2002) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |114 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 songs Category:2002 singles Category:Mis-Teeq songs Category:Music videos directed by Jake Nava Category:Songs written by Alesha Dixon Category:Songs written by Sabrina Washington Category:Songs written by Su-Elise Nash Category:UK garage songs ",
