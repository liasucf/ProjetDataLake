Macelwane Medal in 2008 from the American Geophysical Union for her research on coupled water and carbon cycles. The award is given to \u201csignificant contributions to the geophysical sciences by an outstanding early career scientist.\u201d == Early life and education == Diane E. Pataki was born in New York City, NY. She attended Jamaica High School and was included in the first group of students to participate in the Gateway to Higher Education (program) which started in 1986. The Gateway program allowed for students to receive extra exposure and mentorship in science and math. Pataki has cited this as what inspired her to pursue scientific research. Pataki took extra science, research and writing classes at the City University of New York. Pataki graduated from Barnard College with a major in Environmental Science in 1993. During this time she worked as an intern at the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund assisting the Executive Director, Fred Krupp. Pataki attended the Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment to pursue a M.S. and Ph.D.. While at Duke, she met Professor Ram Oren who became her Ph.D. advisor. Pakati's dissertation is titled \"Water use of co-occurring species in response to environmental conditions at varying temporal scales\". Her two post-doctoral mentors were James Coleman at the Desert Research Institute and James Ehleringer at University of Utah. == Career and research == After her doctoral research, Pataki became a professor at the University of California, Irvine in 2004. While at UCI, she was the founding Director of the Center for the Environmental Biology and the Steele Burnard Anza Borrego Desert Research Center in 2011. Pataki then went to the University of Utah in 2012 as an associate professor for the Department of Biology as well as an adjunct in the Department of City & Metropolitan Planning. In 2014, she served as a Program Director of the Division of Environmental Biology at the National Science Foundation. In the same year, Pataki was also a member of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Board of Scientific Counselors. Diane's earlier research under Ram Oren while at the Desert Research Institute looked at the variance of somatic conductance in species. She now specializes in the coupling of biogeochemical cycles in urban environments and how they interact with ecosystem services and she also uses carbon isotopes in ecosystem studies to calculate carbon dioxide fluxes produced. Diane was honored in 2015 by the Leopold Leadership Program to be inducted as a Fellow for her research on the effects of urban ecosystems on local climate, pollution, and water resources in cities. She currently serves on National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Biological Sciences as well as the NSF's Advisory Committee on Environmental Research and Education. == Honors == * Chief Specialty Editor for Urban Ecology at the Journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution * Member of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for Biological Sciences Advisory Committee 2017 *National Science Foundation Advisory Committee on Environmental Research and Education 2018 * Program Director in the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology 2014-2015 * Member of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Board of Scientific Counselors 2014 === Awards === * 2015 Fellow of the Leopold Leadership Program * 2008 James B.
