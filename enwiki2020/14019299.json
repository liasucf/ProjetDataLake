This hospital was first medical school in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and was used by Dr. Green to train more than 60 locals as doctors during his 30-year tenure in Ceylon as part of the American Ceylon Mission. In the middle of the 20th century, it was a state of the art medical institution that served the rich and the poor alike. It is no longer considered to be a premier medical institution in Jaffna Peninsula in Sri Lanka. ==References== Category:American Ceylon Mission Category:Buildings and structures in Manipay Category:Hospitals established in 1848 Category:Hospitals in Jaffna District Category:Non-profit hospitals in Sri Lanka Category:1848 establishments in Ceylon Category:Charitable hospitals ",
