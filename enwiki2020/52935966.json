She is unsure of what kind of wish she wants and is generally the spectator of the dark nature of WIXOSS. Despite becoming more and more aware of the terrible nature of the Selector battles, she often finds herself enjoying battles. Ruko later finds her own wish, which is to free the LRIGs from their cards and return them to their own lives. In the end of season 1, Ruko loses Tama, and her new LRIG card becomes Yuki. In Spread, she adds the condition to turn all LRIGs into humans so that even those who were originally LRIGs can also become human, which she does in the final episode. She starts looking for Tama some time afterwards. Ruko has already become a high school student alongside Yuzuki and Hitoe in conflated. She is approached by Kiyoi who asked for her help to put a stop to the new Selector Battle, but she refused out of concern for Tama's safety. Unfortunately, she is then chosen to become Selector once more. ; : : Ruko's LRIG, white in color. She has a cutesy appearance and lively personality. In battle, however, she displays a frightening bloodlust. After failing to form a contract with Ruko, she ends up becoming Ulith's LRIG. She at first forgot about Mayu, but remembers fully later in Spread. She is the 'Girl of Light', an LRIG created by Mayu, and her true name is Shiro. She later rejects taking over Iona's body, and returns to Mayu as a result, only to shortly after get locked up by Mayu. She is later freed and merges with Yuki.

After becoming an Eternal Girl, she becomes Ruko's LRIG, while Ulith takes over her body as part of her wish is to become the LRIG of a Selector who is stronger than her. In Spread, It is later revealed that she is originally an LRIG named Kuro that created by Mayu along with Tama, and she's referred as \"The Girl of Dark\". Yuki also begins to bond with Ruko, and later becomes her friend, and like Tama desires to help Mayu become their friend as well. After the original Iona Urazoe manages to return to her original body, Ruko gives her the name Yuki to distinguish them. After Ruko does her wish in the last episode of Spread, although Yuki is not shown, she is assumed to also have become human, as Ruko's wish was to turn even those who were originally LRIGs into humans. ; : :Kiyoi Mizushima is the main heroine of Selector infectred WIXOSS - Peeping Analyze and Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS.

For this reason, she refuse to open her heart when her classmate, Ayumi Sakaguchi, constantly tried to befriend her. When Sakaguchi got hit by a truck in attempt to save her and realizing that Sakaguchi truly wanted to become friends with her, Kiyoi became determined to save her and became a Selector with an LRIG named Remember. However, when becoming an LRIG Pirulurk, Mayu shows her the outcome of her wish: Remember, who now inhabits her body, \"saves\" Sakaguchi by turning off her life support and leaving her to die, ending her suffering. Since then she set her goal to take revenge on Remember. Unfortunately, as Pirulurk, she is known as LRIG who brings misfortune to her Selectors as they can never win. Kiyoi's desire for revenge faltered when she was paired with a Selector named Amika Hashimoto who not only bears resemblance with Sakaguchi but also has similar wish as hers when she was a Selector. When she reunited with Remember who was using her body, Kiyoi evolved into Level 5 and used her power to rewrote Amika's wish that resulted with Amika having her wish fulfilled when they lost against Remember.
