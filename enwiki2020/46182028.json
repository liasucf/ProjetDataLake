In Birmingham the Labour Party went against the trend across the United Kingdom, as they lost the General Election the Labour Party managed to strengthen its hold on Birmingham City Council as well as performing well in the Westminster seats. This is despite the problems facing the Council in the form of the recent Operation Trojan Horse scandal and the Kerslake review, which was highly critical of Birmingham City Council.
