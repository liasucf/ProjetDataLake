    "text": "Oil Patch Hotline is a semi-monthly newsletter about the oil and gas production industry in North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. It is published in Williston, North Dakota. The parent company is based out of Plymouth, Florida. Publication began in 1978 as the domestic oil industry flourished with rising energy prices. The cycle of high crude oil prices ended in the early 1980s and with it much of the oil exploration activity in the United States. As a result, the newsletter suspended publication in 1986. Publication of Oil Patch Hotline resumed in June 2006 as worldwide energy demand generated renewed interest in domestic oil production. ==References== ==External links== *Oil Patch Hotline website *WorldCat record Category:Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Category:Business magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1978 Category:Magazines published in North Dakota Category:Petroleum magazines Category:Williston, North Dakota ",
