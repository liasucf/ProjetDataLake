It previously could be found on all main islands, but today populations only exist on Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and L\u0101nai, and the Big Island. ==Conservation== The total population of G. brighamii is between 15 and 19 trees. There are only two plants in the wild on Oahu and one on the Big Island. Major threats to the survival of this species include loss of dry forest habitat and the establishment of invasive species, such as fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum). ==Uses== Native Hawaiians made kua kuku (kapa anvils) and pou (house posts) from the wood of n\u0101n\u016b. A yellow kapa dye was derived from the fruit pulp. The white, fragrant flowers are used in lei. Today, it is grown as an ornamental plant on the islands. ==References== ==External links== * brighamii Category:Plants described in 1867 Category:Endemic flora of Hawaii Category:Trees of Hawaii Category:Critically endangered flora of the United States Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
