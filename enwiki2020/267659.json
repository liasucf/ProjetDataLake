    "text": "Zhao Yun ( ) (died 229), courtesy name Zilong (), was a military general who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217\u2013219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han \u2013 founded by Liu Bei in 221 \u2013 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life have been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. ==Historical sources on Zhao Yun's life== Zhao Yun's original biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), written by Chen Shou in the third century, is only 346 Chinese characters long. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi added annotations from the Zhao Yun Biezhuan (\u8d99\u96f2\u5225\u50b3; Unofficial Biography of Zhao Yun) to Zhao Yun's biography in the Sanguozhi, providing a relatively clear, though still incomplete picture of Zhao Yun's life. ==Early career under Gongsun Zan== Zhao Yun displays valour in front of Gongsun Zan, an illustration from a Qing dynasty edition of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Zhao Yun was from Zhending County, Changshan Commandery.(\u8d99\u96f2\u5b57\u5b50\u9f8d\uff0c\u5e38\u5c71\u771f\u5b9a\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. The Zhao Yun Biezhuan described his physical appearance as follows: eight chi tall (approximately 1.85 metres), with majestic and impressive looks.(\u96f2\u5225\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u96f2\u8eab\u9577\u516b\u5c3a\uff0c\u59ff\u984f\u96c4\u5049\uff0c ...) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. After receiving a recommendation from the Administrator of Changshan Commandery to serve in the government, Zhao Yun led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province.(... \u70ba\u672c\u90e1\u6240\u8209\uff0c\u5c07\u7fa9\u5f9e\u540f\u5175\u8a63\u516c\u5b6b\u74da\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Around the time, the warlord Yuan Shao had experienced a surge in fame after his recent appointment as the Governor of Ji Province, so Gongsun Zan was worried that many people in You Province would choose to serve under Yuan Shao instead of him.(\u6642\u8881\u7d39\u7a31\u517e\u5dde\u7267\uff0c\u74da\u6df1\u6182\u5dde\u4eba\u4e4b\u5f9e\u7d39\u4e5f\uff0c ...) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. When Zhao Yun showed up with his volunteers, Gongsun Zan asked him mockingly: \"I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. Why did you have a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?\"(... \u5584\u96f2\u4f86\u9644\uff0c\u5632\u96f2\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u805e\u8cb4\u5dde\u4eba\u7686\u9858\u8881\u6c0f\uff0c\u541b\u4f55\u7368\u8ff4\u5fc3\uff0c\u8ff7\u800c\u80fd\u53cd\u4e4e\uff1f\u300d) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Zhao Yun replied: \"The Empire is in a state of chaos and it is unclear who is right and who is wrong. The people are in danger. Those in my home province, after careful deliberation, decided to follow a lord who governs with benevolence. Therefore, I chose to join you, General, instead of Lord Yuan.\" Gongsun Zan then accepted him. Zhao Yun later fought on Gongsun Zan's side in some battles against rival forces.(\u96f2\u8345\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5929\u4e0b\u8a29\u8a29\uff0c\u672a\u77e5\u5b70\u662f\uff0c\u6c11\u6709\u5012\u7e23\u4e4b\u5384\uff0c\u9119\u5dde\u8ad6\u8b70\uff0c\u5f9e\u4ec1\u653f\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u4e0d\u70ba\u5ffd\u8881\u516c\u79c1\u660e\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u9042\u8207\u74da\u5f81\u8a0e\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ==Meeting Liu Bei== Around the early 190s, Zhao Yun met Liu Bei, who was taking shelter under Gongsun Zan at the time. Zhao Yun became very close to Liu Bei and desired to switch his allegiance to Liu Bei.(\u6642\u5148\u4e3b\u4ea6\u4f9d\u8a17\u74da\uff0c\u6bcf\u63a5\u7d0d\u96f2\uff0c\u96f2\u5f97\u6df1\u81ea\u7d50\u8a17\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. When Gongsun Zan sent Liu Bei to assist his ally, Tian Kai, in a battle against Yuan Shao, Zhao Yun followed Liu Bei and served as a cavalry officer under Liu Bei.(\u672c\u5c6c\u516c\u5b6b\u74da\uff0c\u74da\u9063\u5148\u4e3b\u70ba\u7530\u6977\u62d2\u8881\u7d39\uff0c\u96f2\u9042\u96a8\u5f9e\uff0c\u70ba\u5148\u4e3b\u4e3b\u9a0e\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. When Zhao Yun received news of his elder brother's death, he asked for a temporary leave of absence from Liu Bei to mourn his brother. Liu Bei knew that Zhao Yun would not return after leaving, so he held Zhao Yun's hand while bidding him farewell. Before departing, Zhao Yun told Liu Bei: \"I will never forget your favour.\"(\u96f2\u4ee5\u5144\u55aa\uff0c\u8fad\u74da\u66ab\u6b78\uff0c\u5148\u4e3b\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53cd\uff0c\u6349\u624b\u800c\u5225\uff0c\u96f2\u8fad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7d42\u4e0d\u80cc\u5fb7\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ==Service under Liu Bei== In early 200, after Liu Bei lost his base in Xu Province to his rival Cao Cao, he fled north across the Yellow River and sought refuge under Yuan Shao, Cao Cao's rival. Around the same time, Zhao Yun also came to Ye, Yuan Shao's headquarters, where he met Liu Bei again. Zhao Yun and Liu Bei shared the same room during their stay in Ye.(\u5148\u4e3b\u5c31\u8881\u7d39\uff0c\u96f2\u898b\u65bc\u9134\u3002\u5148\u4e3b\u8207\u96f2\u540c\u5e8a\u7720\u5367\uff0c ...) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Liu Bei secretly instructed Zhao Yun to help him gather hundreds of men who were willing to follow him, and claim that they served under the General of the Left (). Yuan Shao was unaware of this. Zhao Yun then accompanied Liu Bei and his followers as they left Yuan Shao and headed south to join Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province.(... \u5bc6\u9063\u96f2\u5408\u52df\u5f97\u6578\u767e\u4eba\uff0c\u7686\u7a31\u5289\u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd\u90e8\u66f2\uff0c\u7d39\u4e0d\u80fd\u77e5\u3002\u9042\u96a8\u5148\u4e3b\u81f3\u834a\u5dde\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ===Saving Xiahou Lan=== In 202, when Cao Cao was away on campaigns in northern China against Yuan Shao's sons and their allies, Liu Bei took advantage of Cao Cao's absence to launch an attack on Cao Cao's territories in central China. Cao Cao sent his general Xiahou Dun and others to lead an army to resist Liu Bei.(\u5148\u662f\uff0c\u8207\u590f\u4faf\u60c7\u6230\u65bc\u535a\u671b\uff0c ...) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. During the battle, Zhao Yun captured Xiahou Lan (), an old friend who was from the same hometown as him. He requested that Liu Bei spare Xiahou Lan's life and recommended Xiahou Lan to serve as a military judge because he knew that Xiahou Lan was knowledgeable about law.(... \u751f\u7372\u590f\u4faf\u862d\u3002\u862d\u662f\u96f2\u9109\u91cc\u4eba\uff0c\u5c11\u5c0f\u76f8\u77e5\uff0c\u96f2\u767d\u5148\u4e3b\u6d3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u85a6\u862d\u660e\u65bc\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u8ecd\u6b63\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Zhao Yun earned praise for being conscientious and careful when he maintained a professional relationship with Xiahou Lan despite their friendship.(\u96f2\u4e0d\u7528\u81ea\u8fd1\uff0c\u5176\u614e\u616e\u985e\u5982\u6b64\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ===Battle of Changban=== A mural depicting Zhao Yun at the Battle of Changban inside the Long Corridor at the Summer Palace in Beijing. The rider in white is Zhao Yun. After Liu Biao died in 208, his younger son Liu Cong succeeded him as the Governor of Jing Province. When Cao Cao launched a military campaign in the same year to eliminate opposing forces in southern China, Liu Cong surrendered and yielded Jing Province to him. Liu Bei and his followers abandoned their stronghold in Xinye County and headed further south towards Xiakou, which was guarded by Liu Biao's elder son Liu Qi and was independent of Cao Cao's control. Cao Cao personally led a 5,000-strong elite cavalry force to pursue Liu Bei. They caught up with Liu Bei at Changban and inflicted a devastating defeat on his forces. While Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled,(\u66f9\u516c\u4ee5\u6c5f\u9675\u6709\u8ecd\u5be6\uff0c\u6050\u5148\u4e3b\u64da\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e43\u91cb\u8f1c\u91cd\uff0c\u8f15\u8ecd\u5230\u8944\u967d\u3002\u805e\u5148\u4e3b\u5df2\u904e\uff0c\u66f9\u516c\u5c07\u7cbe\u9a0e\u4e94\u5343\u6025\u8ffd\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u591c\u884c\u4e09\u767e\u9918\u91cc\uff0c\u53ca\u65bc\u7576\u967d\u4e4b\u9577\u5742\u3002\u5148\u4e3b\u68c4\u59bb\u5b50\uff0c\u8207\u8af8\u845b\u4eae\u3001\u5f35\u98db\u3001\u8d99\u96f2\u7b49\u6578\u5341\u9a0e\u8d70\uff0c\u66f9\u516c\u5927\u7372\u5176\u4eba\u8846\u8f1c\u91cd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 32. Zhao Yun carried Liu Bei's young son Liu Shan and protected Liu Bei's wife Lady Gan (Liu Shan's mother) during the battle and delivered them to safety. He was later promoted to the rank of General of the Standard () for his efforts.(\u53ca\u5148\u4e3b\u70ba\u66f9\u516c\u6240\u8ffd\u65bc\u7576\u967d\u9577\u962a\uff0c\u68c4\u59bb\u5b50\u5357\u8d70\uff0c\u96f2\u8eab\u62b1\u5f31\u5b50\uff0c\u5373\u5f8c\u4e3b\u4e5f\uff0c\u4fdd\u8b77\u7518\u592b\u4eba\uff0c\u5373\u5f8c\u4e3b\u6bcd\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u5f97\u514d\u96e3\u3002\u9077\u70ba\u7259\u9580\u5c07\u8ecd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. Earlier on, after his defeat at Changban, Liu Bei heard rumours that Zhao Yun had betrayed him and defected to Cao Cao' side. Refusing to believe the rumours, he threw a short ji to the ground and said: \"Zilong will never abandon me.\" He was right as Zhao Yun returned to him a short while later.(\u96f2\u5225\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u521d\uff0c\u5148\u4e3b\u4e4b\u6557\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u8a00\u96f2\u5df2\u5317\u53bb\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u4e3b\u4ee5\u624b\u621f\u64ff\u4e4b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5b50\u9f8d\u4e0d\u68c4\u6211\u8d70\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u9803\u4e4b\uff0c\u96f2\u81f3\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. In the winter of 208\u2013209, Liu Bei formed an alliance with the warlord Sun Quan and they defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. As Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat, Liu Bei and Sun Quan advanced and conquered Nan Commandery, which used to be under Cao Cao's control. ===As the Administrator of Guiyang=== Zhao Yun was later promoted to Lieutenant-General () for his contributions towards Liu Bei's conquests of the four commanderies in southern Jing Province: Changsha, Lingling, Wuling and Guiyang. After the capture of Guiyang Commandery, Liu Bei appointed Zhao Yun as the new Administrator to replace Zhao Fan.(\u5f9e\u5e73\u6c5f\u5357\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u504f\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u9818\u6842\u967d\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u4ee3\u8d99\u7bc4\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Zhao Fan had a widowed sister-in-law who was famous for her beauty. He wanted to arrange for her to marry Zhao Yun so as to build connections with Zhao Yun. However, Zhao Yun rejected the idea and told Zhao Fan: \"We share the same family name. Your elder brother is also like an elder brother to me.\"(\u7bc4\u5be1\u5ac2\u66f0\u6a0a\u6c0f\uff0c\u6709\u570b\u8272\uff0c\u7bc4\u6b32\u4ee5\u914d\u96f2\u3002\u96f2\u8fad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u76f8\u8207\u540c\u59d3\uff0c\u537f\u5144\u7336\u6211\u5144\u3002\u300d\u56fa\u8fad\u4e0d\u8a31\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. There were others who urged Zhao Yun to accept the marriage but Zhao Yun firmly refused and said: \"Zhao Fan was forced to surrender because of the circumstances. His intentions are unclear and suspicious. Besides, there are many other women in this world.\" Not long later, Zhao Fan escaped, and Zhao Yun was able to avoid any association with him because he did not agree to the marriage.(\u6642\u6709\u4eba\u52f8\u96f2\u7d0d\u4e4b\uff0c\u96f2\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7bc4\u8feb\u964d\u8033\uff0c\u5fc3\u672a\u53ef\u6e2c\uff1b\u5929\u4e0b\u5973\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002\u300d\u9042\u4e0d\u53d6\u3002\u7bc4\u679c\u9003\u8d70\uff0c\u96f2\u7121\u7e96\u4ecb\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ===Guarding Jing Province=== Around 211, Liu Bei led an army west into Yi Province to assist the provincial governor Liu Zhang in countering a rival warlord, Zhang Lu of Hanzhong Commandery. Zhao Yun and others remained behind to guard Jing Province.(\u5148\u4e3b\u5165\u8700\uff0c\u96f2\u7559\u834a\u5dde\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36.(\u5148\u4e3b\u5165\u76ca\u5dde\uff0c\u96f2\u9818\u7559\u71df\u53f8\u99ac\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Sometime in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun, to strengthen the Sun\u2013Liu alliance. Lady Sun also remained in Jing Province when Liu Bei left for Yi Province. As she saw herself as the sister of a powerful warlord, Lady Sun not only acted in an arrogant and unbridled manner, but also allowed her bodyguards and personal staff to behave lawlessly in Jing Province. For this reason, Liu Bei specially appointed Zhao Yun, whom he deemed a serious and conscientious person, to oversee domestic affairs in Jing Province and maintain law and order during his absence.(\u6b64\u6642\u5148\u4e3b\u5b6b\u592b\u4eba\u4ee5\u6b0a\u59b9\u9a55\u8c6a\uff0c\u591a\u5c07\u5433\u540f\u5175\uff0c\u7e31\u6a6b\u4e0d\u6cd5\u3002\u5148\u4e3b\u4ee5\u96f2\u56b4\u91cd\uff0c\u5fc5\u80fd\u6574\u9f4a\uff0c\u7279\u4efb\u638c\u5167\u4e8b\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had left for Yi Province, he sent a vessel to fetch his sister home. Lady Sun attempted to bring Liu Bei's son Liu Shan along with her, but Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei led their men to stop her and retrieved Liu Shan.(\u6b0a\u805e\u5099\u897f\u5f81\uff0c\u5927\u9063\u821f\u8239\u8fce\u59b9\uff0c\u800c\u592b\u4eba\u5167\u6b32\u5c07\u5f8c\u4e3b\u9084\u5433\uff0c\u96f2\u8207\u5f35\u98db\u52d2\u5175\u622a\u6c5f\uff0c\u4e43\u5f97\u5f8c\u4e3b\u9084\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ===Conquest of Yi Province=== Liu Bei and Liu Zhang were friendly towards each other in the beginning, but tensions between them gradually increased until the point of armed conflict around late 212. Liu Bei was initially stationed at Jiameng Pass (\u846d\u840c\u95dc; in present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan), where he was helping Liu Zhang defend the area from Zhang Lu. However, he turned against Liu Zhang later and attacked him. He ordered Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and others to lead reinforcements from Jing Province into Yi Province to help him, while Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province.(\u5148\u4e3b\u8ecd\u76ca\u5f37\uff0c\u5206\u9063\u8af8\u5c07\u5e73\u4e0b\u5c6c\u7e23\uff0c\u8af8\u845b\u4eae\u3001\u5f35\u98db\u3001\u8d99\u96f2\u7b49\u5c07\u5175\u6eaf\u6d41\u5b9a\u767d\u5e1d\u3001\u6c5f\u5dde\u3001\u6c5f\u967d\uff0c\u60df\u95dc\u7fbd\u7559\u93ae\u834a\u5dde\u3002\u5148\u4e3b\u9032\u8ecd\u570d\u96d2\uff1b\u6642\u748b\u5b50\u5faa\u5b88\u57ce\uff0c\u88ab\u653b\u4e14\u4e00\u5e74\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 32. The reinforcements marched along the Yangtze River and conquered the commanderies and counties in the surrounding areas.(\u5148\u4e3b\u81ea\u846d\u840c\u9084\u653b\u5289\u748b\uff0c\u53ec\u8af8\u845b\u4eae\u3002\u4eae\u7387\u96f2\u8207\u5f35\u98db\u7b49\u4ff1\u6cdd\u6c5f\u897f\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5b9a\u90e1\u7e23\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. When they reached Jiangzhou, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun to lead a separate force to attack Jiangyang Commandery (\u6c5f\u967d\u90e1; around present-day Neijiang, Sichuan) and take an alternate route, and later rendezvous with Liu Bei and the other armies outside Yi Province's capital, Chengdu.(\u81f3\u6c5f\u5dde\uff0c\u5206\u9063\u96f2\u5f9e\u5916\u6c34\u4e0a\u6c5f\u967d\uff0c\u8207\u4eae\u6703\u4e8e\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. In 214, Liu Zhang gave up resistance and surrendered to Liu Bei, who gained control over Yi Province. Zhao Yun was appointed as General of the Assisting Army ().(\u6210\u90fd\u65e3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ee5\u96f2\u70ba\u7fca\u8ecd\u5c07\u8ecd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 36. After taking Yi Province, Liu Bei held a discussion on how to distribute the households in Chengdu and the fields outside the city among his followers because he wanted to reward them for their efforts in the campaign.(\u96f2\u5225\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u76ca\u5dde\u65e3\u5b9a\uff0c\u6642\u8b70\u6b32\u4ee5\u6210\u90fd\u4e2d\u5c4b\u820d\u53ca\u57ce\u5916\u5712\u5730\u6851\u7530\u5206\u8cdc\u8af8\u5c07\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36.

Liu Bei's general Huang Zhong killed Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan at the Battle of Mount Dingjun of 218\u2013219. After Xiahou Yuan's defeat, Huang Zhong heard that enemy troops were transporting food supplies in the vicinity so he led a detachment of troops to attack the convoy and seize the supplies.(\u590f\u4faf\u6df5\u6557\uff0c\u66f9\u516c\u722d\u6f22\u4e2d\u5730\uff0c\u904b\u7c73\u5317\u5c71\u4e0b\uff0c\u6578\u5343\u842c\u56ca\u3002\u9ec3\u5fe0\u4ee5\u70ba\u53ef\u53d6\uff0c\u96f2\u5175\u96a8\u5fe0\u53d6\u7c73\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36.

At the time, Cao Cao had sent his forces to attack Liu Bei's positions. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's vanguard force and engaged them in battle until Cao Cao's main force showed up and surrounded him. Despite the overwhelming odds, Zhao Yun attempted to charge and break through the enemy formation and alternated between fighting back and retreating. Cao Cao's forces regrouped, got back into formation and surrounded Zhao Yun. Left with no choice, Zhao Yun had to fight his way out and head back to camp. During the battle, Zhao Yun's deputy Zhang Zhu () was wounded but Zhao Yun turned back, saved him and brought him back to camp.(\u503c\u66f9\u516c\u63da\u5175\u5927\u51fa\uff0c\u96f2\u70ba\u516c\u524d\u92d2\u6240\u64ca\uff0c\u65b9\u6230\uff0c\u5176\u5927\u8846\u81f3\uff0c\u52e2\u903c\uff0c\u9042\u524d\u7a81\u5176\u9663\uff0c\u4e14\u9b2c\u4e14\u5374\u3002\u516c\u8ecd\u6563\uff0c\u5df2\u5fa9\u5408\uff0c\u96f2\u9677\u6575\uff0c\u9084\u8da3\u570d\u3002\u5c07\u5f35\u8457\u88ab\u5275\uff0c\u96f2\u5fa9\u99b3\u99ac\u9084\u71df\u8fce\u8457\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Cao Cao's forces pursued Zhao Yun as he retreated back to his camp. Upon seeing the enemy's approach, Zhao Yun's subordinate Zhang Yi wanted to shut the camp's gates and get the troops to hold their position. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums to be silenced so as to create an illusion of an empty camp.(\u516c\u8ecd\u8ffd\u81f3\u570d\uff0c\u6b64\u6642\u6c94\u967d\u9577\u5f35\u7ffc\u5728\u96f2\u570d\u5167\uff0c\u7ffc\u6b32\u9589\u9580\u62d2\u5b88\uff0c\u800c\u96f2\u5165\u71df\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u958b\u9580\uff0c\u5043\u65d7\u606f\u9f13\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Cao Cao's forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just as they were retreating, Zhao Yun launched a counterattack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other as they panicked and fled, while many of them fell into the Han River and drowned.(\u516c\u8ecd\u7591\u96f2\u6709\u4f0f\u5175\uff0c\u5f15\u53bb\u3002\u96f2\u96f7\u9f13\u9707\u5929\uff0c\u60df\u4ee5\u620e\u5f29\u65bc\u5f8c\u5c04\u516c\u8ecd\uff0c\u516c\u8ecd\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u81ea\u76f8\u8e42\u8e10\uff0c\u58ae\u6f22\u6c34\u4e2d\u6b7b\u8005\u751a\u591a\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. The following day, when Liu Bei came to inspect Zhao Yun's camp and survey the battlefield, he remarked: \"Zilong is full of courage.\" He then threw a feast to celebrate Zhao Yun's victory and they made merry until nightfall.

Guan Yu was later captured in an ambush and executed on Sun Quan's order when he refused to surrender. Following Cao Cao's death in March 220, his son and successor Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian later that year, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Wei with himself as the new emperor. In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu to challenge Wei's legitimacy. In the same year, Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi and agreed to become a vassal under Wei; in return, Cao Pi granted him the title \"King of Wu\". Liu Bei bore a grudge against Sun Quan for the loss of Jing Province and wanted to attack Sun Quan.(\u5b6b\u6b0a\u8972\u834a\u5dde\uff0c\u5148\u4e3b\u5927\u6012\uff0c\u6b32\u8a0e\u6b0a\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36.

In October 222, Liu Bei suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting against Sun Quan's forces, and was forced to retreat to Baidicheng. By the time Zhao Yun showed up with reinforcements at Yong'an, Sun Quan's forces had given up on pursuing Liu Bei and retreated back to Wu.(\u5148\u4e3b\u5931\u5229\u65bc\u79ed\u6b78\uff0c\u96f2\u9032\u5175\u81f3\u6c38\u5b89\uff0c\u5433\u8ecd\u5df2\u9000\u3002) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. ==Service under Liu Shan== After Liu Bei died in June 223, his son Liu Shan succeeded him as the emperor of Shu, with the Imperial Chancellor Zhuge Liang serving as regent because Liu Shan was still underage at the time. Following his coronation, Liu Shan appointed Zhao Yun as Central Protector of the Army () and General Who Attacks the South (), and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Yongchang Village ().

Zhao Yun was already a relatively well-known hero from the Three Kingdoms period, as folktales about his exploits have been passed down through centuries.
