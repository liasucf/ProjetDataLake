Founded as Boiling Springs High School in 1905, Gardner-Webb is one of only three private, Carnegie-classified Doctoral/Professional Universities (along with Duke University and Wake Forest University) in North Carolina. Approximately 4,000 students attend Gardner\u2013Webb, including undergraduates, graduates and online students. A total of 6 professional schools and 14 academic departments offer more than 80 undergraduate and graduate major fields of study. GWU's Runnin' Bulldogs compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the Big South Conference. == History == === Beginnings === On December 2, 1905, the Boiling Springs High School was chartered as a result of an initiative sponsored by the Kings Mountain Baptist Association (Cleveland County) and the Sandy Run Baptist Association (Rutherford County). The institution served as a place \"where the young...could have the best possible educational advantages under distinctive Christian influence.\" In May 1905 Boiling Springs Baptist Church voted to offer its old church house, five acres of land, and $2,700 to the institution, and on July 10, 1905 Boiling Springs was officially chosen for the site of the school. The location of the High School was essential, as it was located near the border of the school's sponsors, Kings Mountain and Sandy Run, and had easy access to brick building materials. The institution's name, Boiling Springs High School, was decided on October 27, 1905, and its charter was accepted less than two months later by the school's trustees. The town of Boiling Springs is named after the natural springs that can be found on campus. They provided clean water for the school when it began operation in 1907. J.D. Huggins was made the High School's first principal on July 25, 1907. The complete faculty, which consisted of only five teachers, including Huggins, was hired by the fall of 1907. Classes started in October of the same year, although the main building, the Huggins-Curtis Building, was not complete. Students lived in various homes in the community and used classrooms from the nearby elementary school until the building's completion in 1908. The building included classrooms, auditoriums, a chapel, library, principal's office, cafeteria, living quarters, literary societies, a music room, and parlors. Although it burned down in 1957, it signified the promise and progress of the school so far. Boiling Springs High School focused on Christian education, as evident in the school's motto, Pro Deo et Humanitate (for God and Humanity). These words were inscribed upon \"the ageless granite arch\" on campus, which still exists today. Original tuition was $76.05 for a term of nine months, and although the school attracted a wide variety of students with varied interests, its focus centered around ministerial education. === Expansion and growth === The high school became Boiling Springs Junior College in 1928 due to the changing educational needs of the area. The Great Depression created many obstacles for the college, but its survival was secured by the sacrifices of loyal supporters. The college began with seven departments: English, mathematics, natural science, foreign language, social science, Bible, and education. The first graduating class consisted of roughly 200 students, with one of the earliest graduates being W. J. Cash, author of The Mind of the South. In 1942, Governor O. Max Gardner began devoting his energy, time, and wealth to strengthening the college. On June 15, the trustees voted to change the name to Gardner\u2013Webb Junior College in honor of Gardner and his wife, Fay Webb-Gardner. During the following year, the institution embarked on a $300,000 financial campaign. At the conclusion of this initiative the trustees announced the school to be debt-free. The decades following World War II were years of physical growth and academic development. New buildings went up as enrollments increased. A major step in the institutions' development was its full accreditation as a senior college in December, 1971. In 1980 the college began a graduate program, which became the Graduate School in the 1990s. The School of Divinity was also founded during this time. The institution officially became known as Gardner\u2013Webb University in January 1993, culminating years of preparation, and by the early 2000s the school had more than 3,200 students and 135 faculty members. E. B. Hamrick Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. === Recent history === Today, Gardner\u2013Webb offers eight distinct degree programs and a campus of over 200 acres. The campus has recently grown with the addition of the Tucker Student Center, a building made possible by a $5 million donation by Robert and Carolyn Tucker, owners of Shoe Show, Inc. in Concord, North Carolina. The College of Health Sciences facility (at the former Crawley Hospital complex) opened in 2015 and it houses the Hunt School of Nursing, the Physician Assistant Studies program and the Department of Exercise Science. GWU received a gift from the Gardner Foundation to support undergraduate research by establishing the Fay Webb Gardner Master Mentorship Program in 2017. In 2019, the university established the first-ever comprehensive and competitive scholarship focusing on students\u2019 character, service, academics and Christian life; the inaugural Tucker Scholar recipient was Leah Carpenter, of Stanley, N.C. ==Campus== The main campus in Boiling Springs is situated on 225 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains between Charlotte and Asheville.

The service itself often consists of scripture readings and musical performances by the University Choir and Orchestra as well as congregational singing.

There is often a reception that follows in the Tucker Student Center. This event is widely attended by students, faculty, and the public. * Pancake Bingo: Often considered as a favorite tradition among students, every semester on the Monday night of exam week, the student body gathers in the dining hall to play bingo and eat pancakes. This popular tradition often sees students waiting well in advance for entry. * Miss Gardner-Webb: The Miss Gardner-Webb Pageant is an annual event sponsored by the Office of Student Activities as a means of fostering personal presentation, maturity, poise, and public speaking in an appropriate competitive setting. The contestants compete in several different categories: Fun Fashion, Talent, Individual Interviews, Evening Gown, and On-Stage Question.

In the past nine years, the team has won a total of six seasons and at least eight matches in a single-season eight times. == Christian focus == As a Baptist founded university, Gardner\u2013Webb offers and exhibits many Christian aspects. The Office of Christian Life and Service encourages and challenges the university community in its Christian growth, offering pastoral care to students, faculty, administration and staff. It provides vocational counseling and referral service to students interested in church related vocations as well, and coordinates the planning of worship services held for the university and community, like the Dimensions program. The Office hopes that \"through ministry organizations, students are encouraged and challenged in personal discipleship, corporate worship, and life-changing ministry and mission experiences.\" === Dimensions === Dimensions is a graduation requirement for all Gardner\u2013Webb students. The purpose is to nurture attendants spiritually, intellectually and culturally from the perspective of a Christian world view and to promote a sense of community. The program is offered every Tuesday during both the Fall and Spring semesters and counts as 1/2 credit hour. A new speaker addresses the university every week, ranging from staff and faculty to artists, professional athletes, and political speakers, all of whom address subjects that relate to the school's core Christian beliefs. Students must attend 10 sessions each semester for four semesters to obtain all of the Dimensions credits needed to graduate, having a total of 2 credit hours in the course by the end of their academic careers. Credit is given on a pass/fail basis. This means that a total of four semesters, or 40 dimensions, must be attended before graduation. === Student ministries === Campus Ministries United is an umbrella association that has worked with Gardner\u2013Webb to create student run ministry groups. Each CMU Council is composed of student leaders who well represent the ideas of Christian Life and Service. Along with the university's ministerial staff, the Council seeks to \"promote a passionate and enduring devotion to Christ among students of Gardner\u2013Webb.\" Student Ministries supports student-led worship services like The Verge, which welcomes all students to worship with others through music, speakers, drama, and fellowship.
