    "text": "Amanita muscaria var. guessowii, commonly known as the American yellow fly agaric, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Amanita. It is one of several varieties of the Amanita muscaria fungi, all commonly known as fly agarics. ==Description== ===Cap=== The cap is 4.5\u201316 (18) cm wide, convex, and becomes broadly convex to flat in age. It is bright yellow or yellow-orange, usually more orange or reddish orange towards the disc, and fading to pale yellow. The volva is distributed over the cap as cream to pale tan warts; it is otherwise smooth and sticky when wet. The margin becomes slightly striate in age. The flesh is white and it does not stain when cut or injured. ===Gills=== The gills are free to narrowly adnate, subcrowded to crowded, cream to pale cream, truncate, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful. ===Spores=== Amanita muscaria var. guessowii spores are white in deposit, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid (infrequently subglobose or elongate) and inamyloid. The spores are (7.0\u2013) 8.7-12.2 (-14.8) x (5.9) 6.5\u20138.2 (9.5) \u00b5m. ===Stipe=== The stipe is (4)6 \u201315 x 1\u20133 cm, more or less equal or narrowing upwards and slightly flaring at the apex. It is white to yellowish cream, densely stuffed with a pith, the skirtlike ring is membranous, persistent, the lower stipe and upper bulb are decorated with partial or complete concentric rings of volval material that are bright pale yellow to cream or sordid cream. ===Microscopic features=== Clamps are present at bases of the basidia. ==Distribution and habitat== Amanita muscaria var. guessowii is found growing solitary or gregariously, it is mycorrhizal with conifers mostly but also deciduous trees as well, it is found often in the fall but sometimes in the spring, common in the northeast, from eastern Canada to North Carolina west to Michigan. ==Biochemistry== As other amanita muscaria, the guessowii variety contains ibotenic acid and muscimol which can cause hallucinations. As with other wild-growing mushrooms, the amounts depends on a lot of external factors, including season, age, and habitat, and it can also vary from mushroom to mushroom. ==Gallery== File:Amanita muscaria DWC 7656.jpg File:Amanita muscaria var. formosa pic 2.jpg File:Amanita muscaria var. formosa pic 3.jpg == See also == * Amanita muscaria var. formosa ==References== ==External links== *http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+muscaria+var.+guessowii muscaria var. guessowii Category:Fungi described in 1933 ",
