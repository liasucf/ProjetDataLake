Built in 1910, the building served as both the town's first high school, and as a private school before being converted to an elementary school. The school close in 1975, and the building was sold to a developer in 1999. After several failed redevelopment proposals, it was sold to St. Paul Roman Catholic Church in 2013.\"KGS: Thanks for the memories\" Berlin Citizen, September 26, 2014 The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012; it was demolished in 2014. The school was considered architecturally significant, its 1910 portion built out of brick with brownstone trim. The bricks were sourced from local brickyards (a major 19th- century industry in Berlin), and its brickwork was of unusually high quality. It had terra cotta frieze panels depicting a variety of subjects, including St. George slaying the dragon. In the 1930s, a major addition was made to house the private Jean E. Hooker School. After closing, it was used for a time as a community center before deteriorating. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut == References == Category:High schools in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Berlin, Connecticut ",
