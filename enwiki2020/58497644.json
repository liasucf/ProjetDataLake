At the National Indigenous Music Awards of 2017, the album won Album of the Year. ==Reception== Working Bull said \"It is very much a Troy Cassar-Daley sounding album, staying true to his sounds and his style of music we have all come to love. This album is composed of songs about reflection; some are deep and meaningful, there are also songs that are great easy listening around a fire but they all seem honest and are strong story telling in nature. This album paints a picture of Troy's life from childhood to young adult.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 8 |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Australian Artist Albums Chart | 49 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 72 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 26 August 2016 | CD, digital download | Liberation Records | LMCD0300 |- |} ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Liberation Records albums Category:Troy Cassar- Daley albums ",
