The album was released on Constant Clip Records. > \"Portland native Raina Rose is everything a young female folksinger should > be. If occasionally a touch too naive or overreaching in her eagerness to > express a surfeit of emotion, she's always so sincere, sweet and disarmingly > goofy and such a heckuva singer that one instantly forgives such > transgressions with a grin. From her late duo the Gypsy Moths to her latest > and best-yet CD, The Prophet, the Panhandler, and the Moon, her vocal, > guitar and songwriting chops continue to flourish. Next week, she heads to > Texas' Kerrville Folk Festival as a finalist in their renowned New Folk > contest.\" Jeff Rosenberg \u2013 Willamette Week, May 2007 ==External links== *Raina Rose dot com *High Sierra Music Festival *Kerrville Folk Festival Category:Living people Category:American folk singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Musicians from Austin, Texas Category:Musicians from Portland, Oregon Category:1982 births Category:Songwriters from Texas Category:Songwriters from Oregon Category:Singers from Oregon Category:21st-century American singers ",
