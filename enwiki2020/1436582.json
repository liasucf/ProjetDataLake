Launched in 1955 as HMS Blaxton (M1132) for the Royal Navy (RN), the minesweeper was transferred to the Irish Naval Service on 22 February 1971, and renamed after F\u00f3la, a legendary queen of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann and a poetic name for Ireland. The minehunter remained in service until 1987, when she was sold for breaking. Blaxton was launched on 21 June 1955. ==Irish Naval Service== HMS Blaxton was handed over to the Irish Naval Service on 22 February 1971. Together with (previously HMS Alverton), the newly acquired vessel was commissioned as Fola the next day. Following her commissioning, Fola in company with Banba, worked up in the Western Mediterranean so that they could complete Harbour Acceptance Trials and Sea Acceptance Trials. On 20 March both ships left the Mediterranean for home, however on the way a storm blew up forcing them to take refuge in Lisbon. The two newest additions to the Navy finally arrived on 29 March 1971, and were used for training and fisheries protection. ==Decommissioning and fate== In 1987, Fola was decommissioned and sold to Spanish interests for breaking. == References == Category:1955 ships Category:Former naval ships of the Republic of Ireland Category:Ton-class minesweepers of the Naval Service (Ireland) Category:Ton-class minesweepers of the Royal Navy Category:Cold War minesweepers of the United Kingdom Category:Ships built in Southampton Category:Ships built by John I.
