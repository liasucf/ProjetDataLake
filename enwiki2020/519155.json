He played for three teams during his 11-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). ==Early life== Brandon was born in Portland, Oregon and attended Grant High School, where he led his team to the 1988 Class AAA Oregon high-school basketball championship, being named Oregon high school player of the year. As a child, he suffered from chronic foot deformation. ==College== Brandon attended the University of Oregon, leading his team to the National Invitational Tournament (NIT) in 1989\u201390 as a sophomore. He then went on to hold several school records: career- and single- season scoring average, assists in a single game (13), single-season steals (twice), and single-game steals (eight). Brandon earned team MVP honors in 1990 and 1991. After being an honorable mention All-American, he became the first Oregon player to leave school early for the NBA. == NBA == === Cleveland Cavaliers (1991\u20131997) === Brandon was selected 11th overall in the 1991 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He spent his first three and a half seasons as the backup to All\u2013Star point guard Mark Price. Filling in for an injured Price during the 1994\u201395 season, Brandon responded by leading Cleveland on an 11\u2013game winning streak. After the season, Cleveland traded Price to Washington. As Cleveland's starting point guard, Brandon earned consecutive All-Star Game appearances in 1996 and 1997, the second of which Cleveland hosted. Sports Illustrated labeled him \"The Best Point Guard in the NBA\" in a 1997 issue, the year he led the Cavaliers in points, assists and steals. He was also awarded the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 1997, for his work with underprivileged youth. Brandon would hold basketball camps, even counting LeBron James as a 7th grade participant.http://www.stepienrules.com/2011-articles/october/terrell- brandon.html === Milwaukee Bucks (1997\u20131999) === In September 1997, Cleveland traded Brandon to the Milwaukee Bucks.

Both Brandon and Newman received letters demanding money. Brandon and his friend, Timothy Upshaw, went along with the letter's request for Brandon to leave a bag outside of his garage with money inside (though they only placed a single dollar bill and plain paper in the bag). Bobby Hayes, the man responsible for the letters, arrived to retrieve the bag when he was confronted by Upshaw. Police were later called to the scene after a resident heard men talking about killing someone. Bobby Hayes was brought into custody and later released on bail, receiving orders not to contact Brandon, Newman or their families. ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1991\u201392 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 82 || 9 || 19.6 || .419 || .043 || .806 || 2.0 || 3.9 || 1.0 || 0.3 || 7.4 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1992\u201393 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 82 || 8 || 19.8 || .478 || .310 || .825 || 2.2 || 3.7 || 1.0 || 0.3 || 8.8 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1993\u201394 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 73 || 10 || 21.2 || .420 || .219 || .858 || 2.2 || 3.8 || 1.2 || 0.2 || 8.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1994\u201395 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 67 || 41 || 29.3 || .448 || .397 || .855 || 2.8 || 5.4 || 1.6 || 0.2 || 13.3 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1995\u201396 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 75 || 75 || 34.3 || .465 || .387 || .887 || 3.3 || 6.5 || 1.8 || 0.4 || 19.3 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1996\u201397 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 78 || 78 || 36.8 || .438 || .373 || .902 || 3.9 || 6.3 || 1.8 || 0.4 || 19.5 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1997\u201398 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Milwaukee | 50 || 48 || 35.7 || .464 || .333 || .846 || 3.5 || 7.7 || 2.2 || 0.3 || 16.8 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1998\u201399 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Milwaukee | 15 || 14 || 33.7 || .409 || .250 || .839 || 3.5 || 6.9 || 1.6 || 0.2 || 13.5 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1998\u201399 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 21 || 20 || 33.9 || .425 || .263 || .830 || 3.9 || 9.8 || 1.9 || 0.3 || 14.2 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 1999\u201300 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 71 || 71 || 36.4 || .466 || .402 || .899 || 3.4 || 8.9 || 1.9 || 0.4 || 17.1 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2000\u201301 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 78 || 78 || 36.2 || .451 || .363 || .871 || 3.8 || 7.5 || 2.1 || 0.3 || 16.0 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2001\u201302 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 32 || 28 || 30.1 || .425 || .174 || .988 || 2.9 || 8.3 || 1.6 || 0.2 || 12.4 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 724 || 480 || 29.8 || .448 || .355 || .873 || 3.0 || 6.1 || 1.6 || 0.3 || 13.8 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star | 2 || 0 || 18.5 || .381|| .375 || 1.000 || 2.9 || 5.5 || 1.5 || 0.5 || 10.5 ===Playoffs=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1992 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 12 || 0 || 13.1 || .400 || .000 || .750 || 1.8 || 2.5 || 0.3 || 0.1 || 3.9 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1993 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 8 || 0 || 16.5 || .435 || .400 || 1.000 || 2.1 || 2.1 || 0.9 || 0.4 || 6.4 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1994 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 3 || 0 || 18.7 || .632 || .000 || .667 || 1.3 || 1.7 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 8.7 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1996 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland | 3 || 3 || 41.7 || .447 || .333 || .867 || 3.0 || 8.0 || 1.3 || 0.3 || 19.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 1999 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 4 || 4 || 40.3 || .449 || .600 || .923 || 7.5 || 7.0 || 2.3 || 0.5 || 19.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2000 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 4 || 4 || 40.5 || .508 || .364 || .909 || 5.8 || 8.5 || 0.8 || 0.0 || 19.5 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2001 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Minnesota | 4 || 4 || 38.3 || .435 || .444 || 1.000 || 4.3 || 6.3 || 1.9 || 0.5 || 15.3 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 38 || 15 || 24.9 || .457 || .381 || .897 || 3.2 || 4.3 || 0.8 || 0.2 || 10.5 == References == ==External links== * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:African Americans in Oregon Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Oregon Category:Businesspeople from Portland, Oregon Category:Cleveland Cavaliers draft picks Category:Cleveland Cavaliers players Category:Grant High School (Portland, Oregon) alumni Category:Milwaukee Bucks players Category:Minnesota Timberwolves players Category:National Basketball Association All-Stars Category:Oregon Ducks men's basketball players Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon ",
