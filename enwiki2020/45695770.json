This event count shows a remarkable exponential growth in time, pointing to one event per day in 2025. While moderate in magnitude, the sheer number of events acts as a physical stressor to living conditions and gives an adverse outlook long term on structural integrity of homes and buildings. , van Putten, M.H.P.M., van Putten, A.F.P., & van Putten, M.J.A.M., 2016, Earthquakes and Structures, 11, 861 == Heaviest earthquakes == Since 1904, there were seven earthquakes in the Netherlands with a magnitude of 4.0 or higher.
