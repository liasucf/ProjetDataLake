    "text": "Briggs Automotive Company (BAC) is a British car manufacturing company based in Speke, Liverpool. ==Background== BAC was founded by brothers Neill and Ian Briggs in 2009. The first Mono car was produced in 2011 and made its inaugural public appearance at the VIP launch of the Retro Classics show in Stuttgart, Germany. ==BAC Mono== The company produced the Mono, a single-seater road- legal sports car launched in 2011. Engineers from Cosworth, Hewland, Sachs, AP and Kumho Tires partnered with designers at BAC. The Mono uses carbon fibre composite construction over a steel chassis (with FIA compliant rollover structure) inspired by the construction principles employed in DTM race cars. The nose of the vehicle provides a storage compartment and doubles as impact protection. The Mono was originally powered by a heavily modified Ford Duratec 2,300 cc four-cylinder Cosworth gasoline engine producing at 7,700 rpm. The Mono weights . These specifications result in a time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of . In 2015, the engine was replaced by a 2.5-litre unit developing at 8,000 rpm. The car has a F3-specification six-speed sequential transmission developed by Hewland. Weight distribution is focussed on maintaining a low centre of gravity. The engine is mounted longitudinally to maintain the centralized balance of the car. It includes a fully-adjustable pushrod suspension system with damping elements made by SACHS Racing. AP Racing developed the retardation and stopping ability of the car. The Mono runs on specifically designed Kumho V70A road tires. During production, each vehicle is custom-built around the purchaser's body shape. The size of the seat, pedal reach, and steering wheel position are modified in order to suit the individual's ergonomic requirements. The Mono ran 1:14.3 at the Top Gear test track. This made it the 2nd fastest car to go around the track at the time. ===Reception=== * GQ Track Day Car of the Year 2012 *Top Gear Stig's Car of the Year 2011 *Steve Sutcliffe's \"Car of the Year\" *Xcar Best Drive 2012\u20132013\" Editor's Choice ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manufacturing companies based in Liverpool Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Privately held companies of the United Kingdom Category:Sports car manufacturers Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Roadsters Category:Cars introduced in 2011 ",
