    "text": "Aurat Aurat, also known by its English title Woman, is a 1940 Indian film directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Sardar Akhtar, Surendra, Yakub, Kanhaiyalal and Arun Kumar Ahuja. The film's music is by Anil Biswas and dialogue is by Wajahat Mirza. Mehboob Khan later remade this film as Mother India (1957), which is considered as one of the biggest hits of all time in Indian Cinema (and again repeated Wajahat Mirza for dialogues, Kanhiyalal as Sukhi Lala and Faredoon Irani for cinematography). The movie was reported to have the shades of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth.https://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/may/19copy.htm ==Plot== Radha (Sardar Akhtar) is an indomitable woman, toiling away to feed her three sons and to pay off Sukhilala (Kanhaiyalal), the village's rapacious moneylender. When she learns that she is pregnant again, her husband, Shamu (Arun Kumar Ahuja), runs far away, leaving her to fend for herself against poverty and the lecherous advances of Sukhilala. Later, the two eldest children die, leaving her with only two sons: the strait-laced Ramu (Surendra) and the wild Birju (Yakub). The latter of the two becomes a bandit, who kills Sukhilala and kidnaps his childhood sweetheart. As a result, Radha and Ramu are cast out of the village. Eventually, Radha kills Birju for dishonoring her. ==Cast== A scene from the film * Surendra as Ramu * Sardar Akhtar as Radha * Yakub as Briju * Aroon as Shamu * Harish as Bansi * Jyoti as Jamna * Kanhaiyalal as Sukhi * Vatsala Kumtekar as Kamla * Sunalini as Sunder Chachi * Brijrani as Tulsi * Akbar Gulam Ali as Laloo * Kanu Pande as Chandoo * Wasker as Fulchand * Amirbanu as Kashibai ==References== == External links == * * * Full movie on YouTube Category:1940 films Category:Indian black-and-white films Category:1940s Hindi-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films directed by Mehboob Khan Category:Films about women in India Category:Filicide in fiction Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Urdu-language films Category:Indian drama films Category:1940 drama films ",
