    "text": "Michael Berrin (born May 7, 1967), best known by his stage name MC Serch, is an American rapper and music executive. He is a former member of 3rd Bass and Non Phixion. ==Early life and education== Serch grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was raised by his parents. He attended Far Rockaway High School and graduated from Music & Art High School. He is of Jewish descent. ==Career== After recording three albums with 3rd Bass\u2014The Cactus Album (1989), The Cactus Revisited (1990), and Derelicts of Dialect (1991)\u2014Serch launched a solo career with Return of the Product (1992, Def Jam). The album featured two hit singles: \"Here It Comes\" (which hit #1 on Billboard's Hot Rap Tracks chart); and \"Back to the Grill\" featuring Chubb Rock, Red Hot Lover Tone, and Nas. Serch was the executive producer of Nas\u2019 Illmatic, the best album of hip hop. He also helped to cultivate the rapper O.C. after hearing him on the Organized Konfusion song \"Fudge Pudge,\" helping him secure a record contract with Wild Pitch Records. In 1995, Serch also mentored the newly formed Non Phixion. Since retiring from performing, Serch has run a promotions company (Serchlite Music). He appeared in Spike Lee's Bamboozled (2000) as a member of the fictitious hip-hop group Mau Maus (played by other real-life hip-hop performers such as Mos Def, Charli Baltimore and Canibus). His character was a white revolutionary who was supposed to be \"1/16 black\". From 2003 he hosted Serch In The AM on Detroit urban radio station FM 98 WJLB; he was the first Jewish DJ at that station. MC Serch was dismissed from WJLB in March 2006, reportedly due to a dispute over a Super Bowl weekend party at the club Motor City Live. Serch also hosted the VH1 reality series Ego Trip's The (White) Rapper Show which ended in March 2007. On the show he was known for his catchphrase \"Woop-WOOP!\". A follow-up show, Ego Trip's Miss Rap Supreme, debuted in 2008. Serch has since returned to the radio airwaves in Detroit on the urban station Hot 102.7. Serch has also worked with Hot 102.7's youngest intern (The Black Intern) Daniel Berry, and Rucka Rucka Ali (Comedy Music Artist). Serch appeared in some of Rucka Rucka Ali's music videos. In 2018 he gave an interview with DJ Vlad in which he claimed MC Hammer had once taken out a $50,000 contract on Serch's life, following a misunderstanding over lyrics. ==Discography== ===Solo=== *Return of the Product (1992, Def Jam) ===with 3rd Bass=== *The Cactus Album (1989, Platinum) *The Cactus Revisited (1990) *Derelicts of Dialect (1991, Gold) ===Guest appearances=== *DJ Tomekk - \"Fuck You\" *Kaptain Nemo - The Legend of Kaptain Nemo - Official Mixtape - \"For the Love of Hip-Hop\" (with PJ Sumroc) *Hot Karl - \"Let's Talk\" *Krohme - \"Around Here\" * Non Phixion - \"Legacy\" * Non Phixion - \"5 Boros\" (with D.V.
