Described from top to bottom, the falls consist of non-segmented tiered cascades over bedrock with a few smaller plunges, followed by a single large plunge into a pool. The falls are recessed into a punchbowl feature making it impossible to view the entire waterfall from a single location on the ground. == Location and features == The forbidding terrain around Tin Mine Falls The falls are located in remote country within the Kosciuszko National Park.

Official data from Geoscience Australia list the most significant waterfalls in Australia as: * Wallaman Falls - Queensland, 305mGeosciences Australia * Wollomombi Falls - New South Wales, with a single drop * Ellenborough Falls - New South Wales in a single drop == Conclusions == The estimated height of corresponds with topography but contradicts Geoscience Australia's list of the tallest waterfalls in Australia (this would make Tin Mine Falls the 3rd highest on the continent). Unless the upper limit of the falls is fixed well upstream, to include a long section of shallow-slope non-bedrock streambed, the rumoured height of cannot be substantiated. ==See also== * List of waterfalls of New South Wales ==References== Category:Waterfalls of New South Wales Category:Cascade waterfalls Category:Kosciuszko National Park ",
