    "text": "SV Drochtersen/Assel is a German association football club from the municipality of Drochtersen, Lower Saxony. The club's greatest success has been promotion to the tier four Regionalliga Nord in 2015 after winning the Niedersachsenliga. ==History== The club was formed in 1977 in a merger of the football departments of two local clubs, VTV Assel and TVG Drochtersen. First, unsuccessful attempts to combine the two had already been made three years earlier but were voted down by the members of VTV. It took until 1985 to see the new club having some success when it won promotion to the Bezirksliga. From there the club rose to the Bezirksoberliga L\u00fcneburg, now the Landesliga, in 1987. After an era of success the club declined again in the late 1990s, suffering relegation down to the Bezirksliga in 1997. In 2001 the club returned to what was now the Landesliga L\u00fcneburg.Geschichte SV Drochtersen/Assel website \u2014 Club history, accessed: 21 May 2015 A runners-up finish in the Landesliga in 2004\u201305 took SV Drochtersen/Assel up to the tier five Verbandsliga Niedersachsen-Ost where it played as a lower table side for the next three seasons. In 2008, with the disbanding of the Oberliga Nord, the league was renamed to Oberliga Niedersachsen-Ost. Drochtersen/Assel achieved two upper table finishes in the league in the next two seasons. A seventh place in 2009\u201310 qualified the club for the now single division Oberliga but a 17th place in 2010\u201311 meant it had to drop down to the Landesliga again. Winning a championship in the Landesliga L\u00fcneburg in 2011\u201312 took the club back up to the Niedersachsenliga. After three seasons at this level the club won the league in 2014\u201315 and earned promotion to the Regionalliga Nord. After winning the Lower Saxony Cup in 2018, SV Drochtersen/Assel qualified for the DFB-Pokal. In the first round, they were drawn at home against Bayern Munich \u2013 winner of the previous six Bundesliga titles \u2013 and lost by a sole goal from Robert Lewandowski in the last ten minutes.
