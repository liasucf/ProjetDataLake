    "text": "The Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway is located northeast of Silverton, Colorado in San Juan and Hinsdale Counties. The route is circular, running from the ghost town of Animas Forks to Lake City and return. The Byway combines crossings of Engineer and Cinnamon Passes with high country scenery that features river meadows, alpine tundra, and ghost towns. While the meadows and tundra are accessible to ordinary passenger vehicles, a high-clearance 4-wheel drive vehicle is required to travel the entire route. \"Wilderness along the Alpine Loop in Colorado\". __TOC__ ==Route description== The Alpine Loop is generally considered to begin and end at Lake City. From there the route commonly followed is west over Cinnamon Pass to Animas Forks, and then returning east over Engineer Pass back to Lake City. This clockwise circuit generally puts the vehicle on the inside \"lane\" of the mountainous portions (but moot because almost all is single track) with the driver on the outside, providing a better view of the relative position of the vehicle and the outer edge of the road at the top of the drop-off. ==Major intersections== ==Alpine Loop gallery== File:Engineer pass road, CO.jpg|Along the road to Engineer pass File:Animas Forks shack.jpg|Abandoned building in Animas Forks, on the Alpine Loop File:Capitol City, Colo.jpg|Capitol City ghost town File:California Gulch Rd, Colo.jpg|California Gulch Road, near Animas Forks File:Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway.JPG|Signs at the start of the road in Lake City ==References== ==External links== * BLM Alpine Loop website Category:Colorado Scenic Byways Category:Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways Category:Bureau of Land Management areas in Colorado Category:San Juan Mountains (Colorado) Category:San Juan National Forest Category:Transportation in Hinsdale County, Colorado Category:Transportation in San Juan County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Hinsdale County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in San Juan County, Colorado ",
