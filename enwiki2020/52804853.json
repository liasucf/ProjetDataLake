McCollum is currently the defensive coordinator for Western Carolina. ==Coaching career== McCollum was an assistant at Georgia Tech from 2010\u20132018. Head coach Paul Johnson retired at the end of the 2018 season. Incoming head coach Geoff Collins did not retain any of the former staff, although there was some thought McCollum's ability as a recruiter might lead to his retention. McCollum returned to coaching in 2020 when Western Carolina hired him as defensive coordinator under head coach Mark Speir, replacing John Wiley. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Western Carolina profile Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:American football offensive guards Category:American football tight ends Category:Austin Peay Governors football players Category:Baylor Bears football coaches Category:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football coaches Category:Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football coaches Category:NC State Wolfpack football coaches Category:UTEP Miners football coaches Category:Western Carolina Catamounts football coaches ",
