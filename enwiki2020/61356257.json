    "text": "The lion's tail is a daiquiri-like cocktail made with bourbon, allspice dram, lime juice, simple syrup or gomme syrup, and angostura bitters, and garnished with orange peel oil or a lime zest twist. Egg white can also be added. The drink has much in common with a whiskey sour except with lime in place of lemon. Tuxedo No. 2 notes the counterintuitive nature of the drink's pairings: \"Allspice dram and lime are ready made for rum, but instead we get bourbon, which typically partners with lemon.\" Punch describes it as \"a whiskey-based cocktail that seems to have all the trappings of a tiki drink.\" The drink debuted in the 1930s. It is similar to None But the Brave, but uses bourbon in place of the brandy and rum. ==Variants== The Tiger's Tail has aged cacha\u00e7a and a salted honey syrup. ==References== Category:Cocktails ",
