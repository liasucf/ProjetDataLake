She released her debut extended play, Junk, on June 7, 2019. ==Early life and education== Hanson was born and raised in Onalaska, Wisconsin. She was inspired to become a singer by Justin Bieber, and at 14, she and a friend began posting cover songs on YouTube, hoping to follow Bieber's path. ==Career== === 2016\u20132018: Career beginnings === In May 2016, while working as a cashier at McDonald's, Hanson entered a local iHeart Radio contest to see Zayn in concert. As her entry, she recorded a video of herself singing \"Pillowtalk\" by Zayn while sitting in a parked car outside a shopping mall. She posted the video to Instagram, and it was quickly reposted by iHeart, drawing significant attention. Hanson was subsequently contacted by a talent agent who invited her to Toronto to audition and record for producers from House of Wolf. While in Los Angeles, she worked with songwriter Dale Anthoni. In November 2017, Taylor Swift included Hanson's second single, \"Only One\", on an Apple Music playlist of her favorite songs. Hanson released a video for the song in March 2018, directed by Similar But Different, who assembled an all-female crew for the shoot. In April 2018, \"Only One\" was averaging 400,000 streams daily. In September 2018, Hanson began touring with Troye Sivan and Kim Petras on Sivan's Bloom Tour, playing at venues including Radio City Music Hall in New York and the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. In a review of the Minneapolis show, Twin Cities Media wrote: \"She's badass, she\u2019s unapologetic, she\u2019s poppy yet gritty, she's effortlessly cool, her music absolutely bangs, and she\u2019s selfmade. Carlie Hanson is a little bit of Lorde, a little of Billie Eilish meets Kiiara, and a lot of something all her own.\" === 2019: Junk === In January 2019, Hanson supported Yungblud on a series of shows in Europe. She then signed with Warner Bros. Records in February 2019, and Primary Wave Music in March 2019. On April 26, 2019, Hanson released \"Back in My Arms\". The song was later announced to be the lead single from her debut EP, Junk. On May 24, 2019, she released \"WYA\", the second single from Junk. Later that day, Taylor Swift added another of Hanson's songs, \"Back in My Arms\", to her Apple Music playlist. The EP, consisting of five songs, was released on June 7, 2019. In September 2019, she embarked on The WYA Tour across Europe and the United Kingdom. ==Personal life == Hanson came out on Twitter in 2018. She has publicly spoken out about LGBTQ+ rights in the media, including an interview with Subvrt Magazine in 2018 where she voiced her opinion about the importance of LGBTQ+ role models. ==Discography== === Extended plays === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" |Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Junk | * Released: June 7, 2019 * Label: Warner Bros. * Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| DestroyDestroyDestroyDestroy | * Released: October 23, 2020 * Label: Warner Bros. * Format: Digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Why Did You Lie\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2017 | rowspan=\"6\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Only One\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Us\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2018 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mood\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Toxins\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Numb\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Back in My Arms\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2019 | rowspan=\"2\"| Junk |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"WYA\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Side Effects\" | rowspan=\"5\" | DestroyDestroyDestroyDestroy |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Daze Inn\" | rowspan=\"4\" | 2020 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Stealing All My Friends\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Good Enough\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ego\" |} === Music videos === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Director(s) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Only One\" | 2018 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Numb\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | Nicholas Jandora |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Back in My Arms\" | Danilo Parra |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Daze Inn\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2020 | Serena Reynolds |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Stealing All My Friends\" | Danielle DeGrasse-Alston |} ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:Warner Records artists Category:American child singers Category:People from Onalaska, Wisconsin ",
