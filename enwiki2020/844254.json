    "text": "thumb A Wartenberg wheel, also called a Wartenberg pinwheel or Wartenberg neurowheel, is a medical device for neurological use. Robert Wartenberg (1887\u20131956) designed the wheel to test nerve reactions (sensitivity) as it rolled systematically across the skin.Lehrner J., e.a.: Klinische Neuropsychologie: Grundlagen - Diagnostik - Rehabilitation, Springer, 2005, S. 135, , here online A Wartenberg wheel is generally made of stainless steel with a handle of approximately in length. The wheel, which has evenly spaced radiating sharp pins, rotates as it is rolled across the flesh. A disposable plastic version is available. Because of hygienic concerns, these devices are rarely used for medical purposes any more.Kornhuber E., e.a.: Die neurologische Untersuchung, Birkh\u00e4user, 2005, p. 16, , here online The Wartenberg wheel is also used as a BDSM or sensation sex toy, sometimes while connected to a violet wand electrical device.Matthias T. J. Grimme: Das SM- Handbuch. Charon-Verlag 2002, Clothing pattern-making can use a version of the Wartenberg wheel, called a pounce wheel, to transfer markings from fabric to paper. Pounce wheels resemble standard Wartenberg wheels in shape but have wooden handles. == See also == * Tracing wheel == References == == Further reading == * Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A.
