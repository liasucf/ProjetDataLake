    "text": "STRO-1 (Stro-1 in mouse, rat, etc.) is a gene for a protein marker of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Molecular mass of Stro-1 is 75kD. The name STRO-1 is firstly proposed in the 1990s' as the name of an anti- CD34+-mesenchymal-stem-cell monoclonal antibody. The name \"STRO-1\" consists of STRO, which means mesenchyme, and \"1\", which means it's the first isolated monoclonal antibody to identify mesenchymal stem cells. The term \"STRO-1\" then was applied to the antigen for this antibody. In human body, STRO-1 exists in many organs, like lung and liver. ==See also== *Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) ==References== Category:Stem cells Category:Human proteins ",
