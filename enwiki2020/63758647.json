The investors were George S. Safford Sr., president; Robert Wankowski, E.G. Howard, Frank R. Rule and Fred W. Forrester. E.A. Forrester & Sons was the agent for the land company.\"Courthouse Note: Incorporations,\" Los Angeles Times, November 4, 1909, image 18 \"Opening of Big Tract, 480 Acres,\" Los Angeles Herald, February 27, 1910, page 15 It was a subdivision of the Joughlin Tract on Slauson Avenue, comprising 2,000 lots, or 99 city blocks, said to be the largest single tract ever placed on the market in Los Angeles. (The figures were later publicized as and 88 city blocks.) The company forbade any billboards from being erected. \"Billboards Barred From Angeles Mesa Tract by Owners,\" Los Angeles Express, February 12, 1910, page 1\"The No-Billboard Roll of Honor \u2014 Who's Next?\" Los Angeles Express, February 22, 1910, page 9 It identified the property as \"on the first decided rise south of West Adams street hill, . . . a fine, smooth piece of tableland which will require little grading.\" A water belt underlay the entire tract. A 1910 news release said: > The subdivision is purely for residences, and . . . no unsightly business > stands in struggling one-story shacks, such as mar even some of the most > exclusive neighborhoods, can ever possibly find a foothold in this > fastidious suburb. A building on the casino (pavilion) order will centralize > all business, and house the company's offices, as well as the butcher, the > baker, and the candlestick maker. By 1916, the community had \"10 stores, an apartment hotel with accommodations for 20 people and a high class motion picture theater in course of construction.\"\"Boulevard Through Angeles Mesa Tract,\" Evening Express, Los Angeles, December 30, 1916, image 20 In that same year, a community celebration, with a torchlight parade, a brass band, \"gaily decorated automobiles\" and fireworks, was held to commemorate the installation of two hundred ornamental street lights, \"set on marbleite pillars.\" Rubie Henrionnet was selected to reign over the festivities as queen of the carnival.\"Noise Greets Lights,\" Los Angeles Times,\" January 16, 1916, image 8 ===Water and annexation=== View Park residential tract.

Ritchey.\"Angeles Mesa Association to Celebrate Light Installation,\" Los Angeles Times, January 8, 1916, image 9 Angeles Mesa's water supply came from Inglewood, so residents petitioned the City of Los Angeles to provide service instead. In August 1916, the Los Angeles Public Service Commission decided to take no action because \"of a large annexation movement\" in unincorporated territory to the west of the then-current Los Angeles city boundary.\"Await Annexation,\" Los Angeles Times, August 31, 1916, image 2 Angeles Mesa voters favored annexation of their unincorporated area by Los Angeles in an election held on April 6, 1917, by a vote of 237 to 200.\"Angeles Mesa Votes for L.A. Annexation,\" Evening Express, Los Angeles, April 7, 1917, image 9\"The Official Canvass,\" Los Angeles Times, April 9, 1917, image 9 A month later, the Business Men's Committee of Angeles Mesa, headed by Fred W. Forrester, campaigned in favor of a large annexation into the city of Los Angeles stretching from Angeles Mesa on the northeast to the coastal Los Angeles sewage-treatment plant at Hyperion on the southwest, adjoining El Segundo. Proponents said that any increase in property tax would be more than offset by a decrease in water rates.\"Angeles Mesans Will Vote on Annexation,\" Evening Express, Los Angeles, April 5, 1917, image 3 According to the Evening Express, Forrester stated it was \"of vital importance\" that the entire area, with its two thousand residents, be annexed to forestall \"at any point down the line [being] converted into a small municipality.\"\"Angeles Mesa Annexation,\" Evening Express, Los Angeles, June 2, 1917, image 1 The West Coast Annexation area of , including the southern part of Angeles Vista, was admitted into Los Angeles in a citywide vote of 49,556 in favor and 26,241 opposed on June 5, 1917.\"Election Figures,\" Evening Express, Los Angeles, June 6, 1917, image 1 On July 29, 1919, Angeles Mesa rejected a proposal to buy the Inglewood Water Company's system at a cost of $80,000 and turn it over to the city of Los Angeles after annexation.\"No Water Purchase,\" Los Angeles Times, July 30, 1919, image 20\"Angeles Mesa Vote,\" Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1919, image 21 The vote was 127 in favor and 103 against, with two-thirds needed for passage.\"Council Ratifies Peck's Annexation,\" Los Angeles Times, June 19, 1919, image 19 Angeles Mesa voters approved a separate annexation to Los Angeles north of 54th Street on July 21, 1922, by a vote of 174-149.

Forrester & Sons announced in August 1910 that it would dedicate a \"public park on each side of the Inglewood-Redondo car line, half a mile long, which will be improved with lawns, flower beds and all kinds of ornamental and flowering shrubbery.\"\"Plan Improvements for Angeles Mesa Tract,\" Los Angeles Herald, August 2, 1910, image 4 Until the 1950s, tracks for the 5 Line streetcar line ran in the median strip along Crenshaw Boulevard between Leimert Boulevard on the north close to Florence Ave on the south. Since the abandonment of the streetcars, the former railway median has been narrowed, the driving lanes improved and the street reconfigured for automobiles, buses and trucks. The southern end of Crenshaw Boulevard was at Adams Street until 1916-1918, when the road was extended between Adams on the north and Slauson Avenue on the south. The extension saved in travel over the nearest through road (Western Avenue) and over the nearest paved road (Vermont Avenue).\"Road Project Is in Peril,\" Los Angeles Times August 20, 1916, image 23\"After Many Delays,\" Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1918, image 82 ==Education== ===Construction=== Artist's conception of the Angeles Mesa Elementary School while it was being built, 1915, from the Los Angeles Times Angeles Mesa Elementary School, 2018 Angeles Mesa Elementary School was completed in 1917 at 2611 W. 52nd Street by the Hyde Park Board of School Trustees, which had to take over construction after the builder failed to fulfill his contract. At that time, Angeles Mesa and Hyde Park were in the same local school district. All three of the trustees lived in Hyde Park.\"Vote New School Bonds,\" September 7, 1915, image 16 In 1915, district voters approved a $100,000 bond issue to build a $60,000 school in Hyde Park and a $40,000 campus in Angeles Mesa.\"Must Vote on New School Bonds,\" Los Angeles Times, September 7, 1915, image 11 The funds available were not sufficient to complete the Angeles Mesa school, so another bond election was held. The Times reported: \"Hyde Park voted solidly against the bonds \u2014 119 to 1 \u2014 while Angeles Mesa mustered eighty-nine votes for and five against.\" > With the bond election lost, a school building less than half completed and > no way to complete it, school opening next week and nowhere, except in an > overcrowded and temporary frame building to house the children, Angeles Mesa > does not know exactly what to do about it.

The solution was for the school trustees to take \"personal charge of the building, buying materials and hiring labor, and deducting the cost from the original contract price.\"\"Trustees Take School Work From Contractor,\" Los Angeles Times December 20, 1915, image 4 In June 1916, a campaign for $20,000 in bonds succeeded, by a vote of 339 to 113. Angeles Mesa's votes in favor, 332-2, overwhelmed Hyde Park's votes against, 7-111. Angeles Mesa residents celebrated with \"music and fireworks,\" saying they had already spent so much \"for street, light and water improvements that they were willing to wait a year for a new school.\"\"Difficulties End,\" Los Angeles Times, June 13, 1916, image 17 Graduation exercises were finally held on May 31, 1917, in the new school auditorium as construction drew to a close. By that time, Angeles Mesa had a representative on the school board, Henry M. Lannan, who told the gathering that his time on the board had been \"very unpleasant.\"\"In New Auditorium,\" Los Angeles Times, June 1, 1917, image 22 ===Description=== A 1915 description of the structure read: > The building is 170x194 feet in size, the classrooms being grouped around an > open court with a large entrance loggia in front and an auditorium in the > rear, seating 500.

In 1978, a Los Angeles Times reporter wrote that the school's \"broad grass yard and airy American Colonial architecture make it one of the prettier schools\" in the Los Angeles Unified School District. ===Desegregation busing=== In 1963, a lawsuit, Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles,Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles was filed to end segregation in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The California Supreme Court required the district to come up with a desegregation busing plan in 1977.

Board of Educ. of the City of Los Angeles, 200 Cal. App. 3d 1397, 1402 (1988). A desegregation plan was developed, to be implemented in the 1978 school year.Bustop, Inc. v.

Ettinger, \"The Quest to DESEGREGATE Los Angeles Schools \", Los Angeles Lawyer, March 2003 The Supreme Court upheld the decision that Proposition 1 was constitutional, and that, therefore, mandatory busing was not permissible. ==Buildings== ===Mesa Theater=== The Mesa Theater at 5807 Crenshaw Boulevard was opened on April 21, 1926, with motion picture actors Gertrude Astor, Junior Coghlan, Ethel Gray Terry, Helene Chadwick, Grace Gordon, and Vera Gordon in attendance.
