    "text": "A measure space is a basic object of measure theory, a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes. It contains an underlying set, the subsets of this set that are feasible for measuring (the -algebra) and the method that is used for measuring (the measure). One important example of a measure space is a probability space. A measurable space consists of the first two components without a specific measure. == Definition == A measure space is a triple (X, \\mathcal A, \\mu), where * X is a set * \\mathcal A is a -algebra on the set X * \\mu is a measure on (X, \\mathcal A) == Example == Set X = \\\\{0, 1\\\\}. The \\sigma-algebra on finite sets such as the one above is usually the power set, which is the set of all subsets (of a given set) and is denoted by \\mathcal{P}(\\cdot). Sticking with this convention, we set :\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{P}(X) In this simple case, the power set can be written down explicitly: :\\mathcal{P}(X) = \\\\{\\emptyset, \\\\{0\\\\}, \\\\{1\\\\}, X\\\\}. As the measure, define \\mu by :\\mu(\\\\{0\\\\}) = \\mu(\\\\{1\\\\}) = \\frac{1}{2}, so \\mu(X) = 1 (by additivity of measures) and \\mu(\\emptyset) = 0 (by definition of measures). This leads to the measure space (X, \\mathcal{P}(X), \\mu). It is a probability space, since \\mu(X) = 1. The measure \\mu corresponds to the Bernoulli distribution with p = \\frac{1}{2}, which is for example used to model a fair coin flip. == Important classes of measure spaces == Most important classes of measure spaces are defined by the properties of their associated measures. This includes * Probability spaces, a measure space where the measure is a probability measure * Finite measure spaces, where the measure is a finite measure * \\sigma-finite measure spaces, where the measure is a \\sigma -finite measure Another class of measure spaces are the complete measure spaces. == References == Category:Measure theory ",
