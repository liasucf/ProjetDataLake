In 1799 the East India Company (EIC) took her up for a voyage to Britain. A French privateer captured her on her return voyage to India. ==Early career== She made one trip to Britain for the EIC. On that trip she left St Helena on 6 July in the company of the East Indiamen , Triton, and , and under escort by the 18-gun Cornwallis.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.353. Armenia arrived in Britain on 27 September. Armenia was admitted to the Registry in Great Britain on 16 November 1799. Armenia appears in the 1800 issue of the Register of Shipping with T. Meek, master, and Walker, owner, and trade London\u2212India.Register of Shipping (1800), Seq. \u2116A661. ==Capture and postscript== The French privateer Clarisse captured Armenia on 5 July 1800 and sent her into Mauritius.Lloyd's List, no.4117, - accessed 11 November 2014. Clarisse was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 180 men under the command of Captain Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Le M\u00eame. Armenia encountered Clarisse at ; after a five-hour chase Clarisse caught up with Armenia and combat ensued. Captain Meik resisted, but after about 40 minutes of exchanging fire he stuck. Armenia had lost her Third Officer killed and six men wounded, one of whom died later; Clarisse appeared to have had three men killed. Another report has Clarisses casualties as seven killed and 20 wounded. Le M\u00eame took Captain Meik (or Meek), his second officer, and the crew on board the privateer. The four passengers, one of them a woman, and the wounded remained on Armenia and reached Mauritius on 17 July, where the French government provided good care. The passengers were then able to return to India in about a month later.Anon. (1868), p.269. Meik and his crew were apparently left on the Seychelles. On 29 October Meik, his crew, and two midshipmen and 15 men from and were put in a small boat of 35 tons bound to Colombo.Although the account offers no explanation for the source of the men from the two Royal Navy ships, the numbers suggest they were prize crews on vessels that the French had recaptured. On 9 November, at about midnight, the boat ran into rocks in the Maldives. Five of the navy men, three of Armenias crew, and five Frenchmen died in an attempt to reach shore on a makeshift raft. The survivors took two Maldivian boats and set sail again. Meik arrived at Cochin on 4 December. Mr. Maddox, a midshipman from Lancaster, died of sickness on the passage. At the time of Meek's letter (6 January 1801) reporting his trials, the second boat, which also had some navy personnel aboard, had not been heard from.Asiatic Annual Register, (1801), Vol. 3, p.56. On 20 July 1801, the members of the Bengal Phoenix Insurance Society presented Captain Meik with an elegant, engraved sword worth 1600 sicca rupees.The Asiatic Annual Register; Or, A View of the History of Hindustan,: And of the Politics, Commerce, and Literature of Asia, .... (1803;J. Debrett, Piccadilly), p. 6. Then on 24 September, the Calcutta Insurance Company voted a donation of \u00a3150 to the mother of Armenias Second Officer, \u00a3100 to the Steward, who distinguished himself in the action, and 500 sicca rupees to establish an annuity fund for the two seamen who suffered in the action.Anon.
