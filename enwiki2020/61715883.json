    "text": "The New York Collegiate Hockey Association was an intercollegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA's Second Division. The league was created in 1977 between 6 then-existing SUNYAC schools as well as Buffalo and Elmira. ==History== With the NCAA instituting a Division II Championship beginning with the 1977\u201378 season 8 upstate New York schools formed the NYCHA to have a better chance at securing one of the bids. So as to not lose those member schools, ECAC 2 began holding two separate conference tournaments the same year, (East and West), allowing those 6 teams to compete with other established division II schools for an NCAA bid. Plattsburgh State left the conference in 1981 and was replaced by RIT. The Conference added Canisius and Hobart over each of the succeeding two seasons but by 1986 the effort to keep the conference as a separate entity stopped and the NYCHA was dissolved. For the duration of the conference all teams played one another twice during the season in conference games. ==Member schools== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! !Location !Athletic nickname !Enrollment# !Colors !Founded !Joined !Left !Succeeding Conference !Current Conference\u2020 |- ! |Brockport, New York |Golden Eagles |8,275 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1867 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |SUNYAC |- ! |Buffalo, New York |Bulls |30,648 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1846 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |Dropped Program |- ! |Buffalo, New York |Ice Griffs |3,464 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1870 |1982 |1986 |ECAC West |Atlantic Hockey |- ! |Cortland, New York |Red Dragons |7,234 |style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1868 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |SUNYAC |- ! |Elmira, New York |Soaring Eagles |1,170 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1855 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |UCHC |- ! |Geneseo, New York |Knights |5,585 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1871 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |SUNYAC |- ! |Geneva, New York |Statesmen |2,237 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1822 |1983 |1986 |ECAC West |NEHC |- ! |Oswego, New York |Lakers |8,909 | style=\"text- align:right;\" | |1861 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |SUNYAC |- ! |Plattsburgh, New York |Cardinals |6,358 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1889 |1977 |1981 |ECAC 2 |SUNYAC |- ! |Potsdam, New York |Bears |4,325 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1816 |1977 |1986 |ECAC West |SUNYAC |- ! |Henrietta, New York |Tigers |16,842 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1829 |1981 |1986 |ECAC West |Atlantic Hockey |- |} # enrollment in 2018 \u2020 as of 2018 ==Membership timeline== DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:20\"<# Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:men value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.8) legend:men id:line value:black id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.8) # PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1981 text:Plattsburgh State (1977\u20131981) bar:2 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Brockport State (1977\u20131986) bar:3 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Buffalo (1977\u20131986) bar:4 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Cortland State (1977\u20131986) bar:5 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Elmira (1977\u20131986) bar:6 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Geneseo State (1977\u20131986) bar:7 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Oswego State (1977\u20131986) bar:8 color:Full from:08/01/1977 till:05/01/1986 text:Potsdam State (1977\u20131986) bar:9 color:Full from:08/01/1981 till:05/01/1986 text:RIT (1981\u20131986) bar:10 color:Full from:08/01/1982 till:05/01/1986 text:Canisius (1982\u20131986) bar:11 color:Full from:08/01/1983 till:05/01/1986 text:Hobart (1983\u20131986) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:1 start:1978 ==See also== *ECAC 2 ==References== ==External links== Category:NCAA Division II conferences ",
