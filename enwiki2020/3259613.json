It is the sister grassland of Cimarron National Grassland and contains both prairie grasslands and canyons. It is separated into two sections, each operated by a local ranger district, one of which is in Springfield and the other of which is in La Junta. The grassland is administered by the Forest Service together with the Pike and San Isabel National Forests, and the Cimarron National Grassland, from common headquarters located in Pueblo, Colorado. ==Geography== Comanche National Grassland consists of in two units: (1) Timpas, south of La Junta, and (2) Carrizo, south of Springfield.accessed Jan 20, 2011 Both units have privately owned tracts of ranchland mixed in with the government-owned land. Elevations on the grassland range from in the southeastern corner of the Carrizo Unit on the Oklahoma border to on Fallas Mesa in the northwestern part of the same unit.DeLorme, Topo, 6.0 Average annual precipitation on the grassland ranges from at La Junta to at Springfield. Summer temperatures are hot with the average high above ; winters are cold with average low temperatures in January below .accessed Jan 20, 2011 Vegetation is mostly steppe and shortgrass prairie, although pinyon and juniper trees are found in rocky canyons and cottonwoods and willows grow near streams. Western soapberry and netleaf hackberry are common in some areas near canyon bottoms, as well as some larger Gambel oak. Chickasaw plum and fragrant mimosa are occasional on uplands within grass cover. A few ponderosa pines are found on cool, moist hillsides. Wildlife on the grassland includes pronghorn, prairie dogs, lesser prairie chickens, mule deer, elk, wild turkey, golden eagle, swift fox, and infrequent roadrunners.accessed Jan 20, 2011 Three hundred and twenty-eight species of birds, including many Eastern birds at the limit of their range, have been recorded in Baca County where most of the Carrizo unit is located. Most of the Carrizo Unit is in the watershed of Carrizo Creek, a tributary of the Cimarron River. The Timpas Unit is in the watershed of the Purgatoire River, also called the Purgatory and Picketwire River. ==History== The marks of ancient American Indians are found in the Grassland in petroglyphs on many of the rocks and cliff faces in the canyons. Some of the rock art may be as old as 8,000 years and some are so new that they depict horses which arrived in the Southwest with the Spanish in the 16th century. The early Indians lived in rock shelters, some of which have been found in the Grassland, and practiced a hunting and gathering culture. Around 1000 AD, a people called the Apishipa began farming in the region, however their efforts were unsuccessful . Apache inhabited this area when the Spaniards arrived. They were pushed southward by the Comanche in the 18th century. Tipi rings \u2013 stones holding down the edges of circular tipis \u2013 are common.accessed Jan 20, 2011 A branch of the Santa Fe Trail ran through the Timpas unit and from the 1820s onward wagon trains from Missouri and Kansas loaded with goods for New Mexico followed the trail. Among the first non-Indian settlers on the Grassland was a group of eleven New Mexican families who settled along the Purgatory River in 1871. In the same year, Eugene and Mary Rourke established a ranch nearby.accessed Jan 20, 2011 Homesteaders soon followed the ranchers and much of the grassland was devoted to growing Broomcorn. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s defeated the farmers and the Federal government bought the land comprising the present National Grassland from its bankrupt owners. Comanche National Grassland was established in 1960.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cootero2/baca.htm, accessed Jan 21, 2011 Grazing permits for cattle are issued by the Forest Service to ranchers for most lands belonging to the National Grassland. An important addition occurred in 1991 when the U.S. Army transferred of land in the Purgatoire River Canyon to the National Grassland. The Army lands were part of the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), a facility devoted to military exercises. However, In 2007, the Army announced a plan to expand the PCMS by purchasing additional land and seeking to transfer the lands of the Comanche National Grassland to Army ownership. The expansion plan, to be implemented in several phases, would increase the size of the PCMS to several million acres, making it the largest military base in the United States. If implemented, the plan would virtually eliminate private land ownership and ranching in Southeastern Colorado as well as abolish the National Grassland and displace 17,000 people. Local citizens and politicians protested the expansion plan of PCMS. On 25 November 2013, the Army announced that its plan to expand the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver site had been cancelled.\"Mark Udall Welcomes the U.S. Army'd Decision on the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site\", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o94-Jd5L7DM, accessed 29 July 2015 ==Recreation, Timpas Unit== Fossilized brontosaur tracks in Picketwire Canyon. Picketwire Canyon is about deep and contains the Purgatoire River track site, one of the largest dinosaur track-ways in the world, in the Morrison Formation. More than 1,300 tracks of Brontosaurs and Allosaurs 150 million years old are preserved in the rocks. Comanche Paleontology brochure The canyon and the dinosaur tracks are accessible by a hiking, biking, and horseback trail that leads one-way through the canyon to the Dolores Mission, the ruins of a small 19th century Catholic church, the dinosaur tracks, and the adobe-buildings of the Rourke ranch, which operated between 1871 and 1971 and is preserved as a National Historic Site.
