It encompasses a broad range of ideas and sentiments harbored by the Vietnamese people for many centuries in the history to preserve and defend the national identity of the Vietnamese nation. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries, Vietnam is the most culturally distinct from the rest, with the country being part of Sinosphere world, and Vietnamese is recognized as the only language in the country. Most Vietnamese nationalism focuses on the military history of the country; however, there are also other aspects of the nationalism in Vietnam. However, most of Vietnamese modern nationalist concepts aim mainly on China, which has many times fueled the anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam, although there were other anti-Cambodian and anti-French in the past. ==History of Vietnamese nationalism== During the first states like Au Lac and Nanyue, nationalism among the population was weak, as there was no centralized Vietnamese nation. However, the nationalism grew following with the later Chinese millennium in Vietnam, several attempts against Chinese occupation resulted with many wars that happened throughout thousand years of Chinese rule, after which Vietnam finally regained independence in the 10th century following the battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng. L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t's famous declaration of Vietnam's independence, Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\u00e0 (Mountains and Rivers of the Southern Country), is a patriotic and nationalistic poem that still lives on in Vietnamese society generations later and now. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i's B\u00ecnh Ng\u00f4 \u0111\u1ea1i c\u00e1o is considered the other declaration of Vietnam's independence against the Chinese Dynasties. In 17th century, in the North during the time of the Tr\u1ecbnh Lords, the Tr\u1ecbnh mandated that the Chinese entering the country had to strictly follow Vietnamese customs and refrain from contacts with the local Vietnamese populace in the cities. However, in the south, the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords favored the Chinese, allowed many Chinese settling in new conquered land from Khmer Kingdom. The immigrated Chinese scholars even became Nguy\u1ec5n Lord officials. The Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty under that influence once saw themselves as \"Han nhan\" (Chinese people). The Nguy\u1ec5n Lord after defeating the Tay Son formed Nguyen Dynasty. The Nguyen Dynasty completed the Vietnamese \"March to the South\" or Nam ti\u1ebfn, in which they over the span of 700 years starting from the L\u00fd dynasty gradually invaded and colonized the entire state of Champa and parts of the Khmer Empire. Under the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty (the most Confucius and sinicized Vietnam dynasty), they attempted to assimilate all of the ethnic minorities in the territories that they had captured by forcing them to adopt sinicized Vietnamese customs. Copying the Chinese idea of Central Plain, the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty saw themselves as belonging to a superior culture, unlike the Indianized states of Champa and the Khmer Empire. As such, they saw themselves as carrying out a civilizing mission against the minorities who were not civilized and were seen as barbarians. In spite of considering themselves as superior due to being sinicized, members of the Vietnamese royalty looked down upon those that were non-Vietnamese as inferior due to Chinese influence. On the later time, after the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty ruling Vietnam, the dynasty had been using the Vietnamization concepts to begin its massive Vietnamization of non-Vietnamese people. During the nam ti\u1ebfn period of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, the Gia Long Emperor stated that \"H\u00e1n di h\u1eefu h\u1ea1n\" \u6f22\u5937\u6709\u9650 (\"the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders\") when differentiating between Khmer and the Vietnamese. Emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng, the son of Gia Long stated with regards to the Vietnamese forcing the ethnic minorities to follow Sino-Vietnamese customs that \"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\" ==Modern Vietnamese nationalism== As for the French invasion, many resistances came around but failed. However, following from time, Vietnamese nationalism also changed and through it, it also focused on only one goal - independence of Vietnam. After 1979 war with China, Vietnam nationalism became anti-China. The sentiment grows bigger because of South China Sea/Vietnam East Sea dispute. ===Economy=== There has been a growing movement among Vietnamese by boycotting Chinese products, and rather using the Vietnamese-made products, which is called \"made in Vietnam\" to counter with \"made in China\". ===Culture=== Despite of being part of Sinosphere cultural influence and sharing many cultural aspects such as Confucianism, and having Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m as its former writing script, Vietnamese nationalists mostly refuse to accept the solely Chinese influence. They believe the Vietnamese already had a profound culture before Chinese influence i.e Dong Son, rice cultivating... Adding with the interactions and later conquests of Indianized Kingdom of Champa, Vietnamese nationalists believe it is a major cross-road of two civilizations rather than one. Vietnamese textbooks also refer to the influence of China but refuse to recognize Chinese elements in Vietnamese nation. The current north Vietnam was part of the land of Bai Yue tribes, so they believe the similarities are because of the Chinese culture was influenced by the culture of Bai Yue tribes when the Han Chinese conquered the land of Bai Yue tribes. ===Military=== For much of its history being razed by wars, Vietnamese developed its nationalism based on its successful history of warfare. Many Vietnamese generals are revered and are a source of pride and nationalism in Vietnamese society, such as Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, the famous general who stood up to the mighty Mongol Empire by successfully repelling the 3 Mongol invasions of Vietnam in 1258, 1285, 1287\u201388 and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7, a revered Emperor and general who defeated the Qing Dynasty of China in the Battle of Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ed3i-\u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a, which was a large battle that is considered to be one of the greatest military victories in Vietnamese history. Both Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 have several streets named after them and statues erected to honor them in Vietnam named, and both are listed as being among the greatest generals in history. Vietnam also heavily honors its long lists of generals in ancient Vietnamese history that fought against Chinese imperialism, such as the Tr\u01b0ng Sisters and Lady Tri\u1ec7u, who were female generals that led major independent movements against Chinese occupation. Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n is well honored for being the first to successfully defeat the Southern Han of China at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (938) and establishing Vietnamese independence, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n for defeating the Song dynasty at the same river in 981, and L\u00ea L\u1ee3i who liberated Vietnam by defeating the Ming dynasty and founding the L\u00ea dynasty. ===Education=== Vietnamese national pride is heavily promoted in Vietnamese textbooks, especially of its development and its heroism. Many Vietnamese stories are still heavily mentioned in the youth education system and among the older generations which have been regarded as a major factor that keeps Vietnamese nationalism alive. ==See also== *History of Vietnam *Culture of Vietnam *Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam *Ho Chi Minh Thought *Ho Chi Minh *V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p *Ngo Dinh Diem *Phan Chu Trinh *Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u *Vietnamization *Vietnamese irredentism ==References== ==External links== Category:History of Vietnam Category:Politics of Vietnam ",
