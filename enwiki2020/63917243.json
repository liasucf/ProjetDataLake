    "text": "Below is a list of covered bridges in Illinois. There are nine authentic covered bridges in the U.S. state of Illinois. Five of them are historic. A covered bridge is considered authentic not due to its age, but by its construction. An authentic bridge is constructed using trusses rather than other methods such as stringers, a popular choice for non-authentic covered bridges. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
