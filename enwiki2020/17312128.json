    "text": "__NOTOC__ {| |} The ICA IS-32 is an open class high-performance metal two- seat sailplane produced in Romania in the 1970s. A refinement of the IS-28B, it shared most of that aircraft's fuselage, mated to new wings and empennage. This new wing had a span of 20 metres, featuring interconnected ailerons and flaps, Schempp-Hirth-type airbrakes. It had no provision for water ballast. The monowheel undercarriage differed from the IS-28 in being fully retractable. ==Specifications== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:1970s Romanian sailplanes Category:Glider aircraft Category:ICA aircraft ",
