It started as an organised activity in Sweden around 2016 and spread to other countries in 2018, following increased concern about plastic pollution. As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running, hiking, or walking. ==Examples and initiatives== Erik Ahlstr\u00f6m started plogging in the Swedish capital city, Stockholm, when he moved there from the \u00c5re ski resort. He created the website Plogga to organise the activity and encourage volunteers. Author David Sedaris combines litter picking with exercise in the Parham, Coldwaltham and Storrington districts of West Sussex, taking up to 60,000 steps a day in pursuit of local rubbish. He was so effective in keeping his neighbourhood clean that the local authority named a waste vehicle in his honour. The Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, Susan Pyper, said \"The sign on this truck is a very fitting way to say a huge \u2018thank you\u2019 to David for his tireless efforts ... he is a real local hero.\" The Keep America Beautiful organisation is now promoting plogging to its affiliates and has found that some already combined exercise with clean up, such as the Trashercize program in Tennessee. In New York, a Meetup group, Plogging NYC, had about 100 members in 2018, with events in four boroughs. In Indianapolis in 2018, a Summer of Plogging was organised by the November Project and the local affiliate of Keep America Beautiful. National Cleanup Day advocates plogging as a way to clean up and keep the outdoors clean. There is a group in Oakland, CA, called Fit4Good that aims to pick up trash around Lake Merritt each week. The Indian PM, Narendra Modi, has plogged to lead by example for his Swachh Bharat Mission to clean up India.PM goes plogging on TN beach, gives Swachh & Fit India drives a big boost, Times of India, 13 October 2019.PM Modi receives Global Goalkeeper award for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, The Hindu, 25 Sept 2019. Pune Ploggers founded by Vivek Gurav is the largest community of ploggers in a single city with more than 500 routine ploggers throughout Pune, and has collected more than 40,000 kilograms of plastic.. In December 2019 the organization coordinated the largest plogging drive, with 105,000 people involved who collected 19,000 kilograms of trash in 1 hour. A non-profit initiative called Go Plog! has collected 16 Tonnes of dry waste in Kolar through plogging. They organise an event every month.
