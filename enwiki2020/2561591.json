    "text": "Scott J. Shenker (born January 24, 1956 in Alexandria, Virginia) is an American computer scientist, and professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. He is also the leader of the Initiatives Group and the Chief Scientist of the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California. Over his career, Shenker has made research contributions in the areas of energy- efficient processor scheduling, resource sharing, and software-defined networking. In 2002, he received the SIGCOMM Award in recognition of his \"contributions to Internet design and architecture, to fostering research collaboration, and as a role model for commitment and intellectual rigor in networking research\". Shenker is an ISI Highly Cited researcher. According to Google Scholar he is one of the five highest-ranked American computer scientists, with total citations exceeding 100,000.See Scott Shenker's Google Scholar Profile == Biography == Shenker received his Sc.B. in Physics from Brown University in 1978, and his PhD in Physics from University of Chicago in 1983. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from the same university. After working as a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University, he joined the research staff at Xerox PARC. He left PARC in 1998 to help found the AT&T; Center for Internet Research, which was later renamed the ICSI Center for Internet Research (ICIR). In 1995, Shenker contributed to the field of energy- efficient processor scheduling, co-authoring a paper on deadline-based scheduling with Frances Yao and Alan Demers. In 2002, Scott Shenker received the SIGCOMM Award in recognition of his \"contributions to Internet design and architecture, to fostering research collaboration, and as a role model for commitment and intellectual rigor in networking research\". In 2006, he received the IEEE Internet Award \"For contributions towards an understanding of resource sharing on the Internet.\" He is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 2016 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is brother of string theorist Stephen Shenker. Shenker is a leader in the movement toward software-defined networking (SDN). He is the co-founder of the Open Networking Foundation and of Nicira Networks. == Publications (selection) == * H. Li, A.
