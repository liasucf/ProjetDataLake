    "text": "Jovan Cviji\u0107 (, ; 12 October 1865 \u2013 16 January 1927) was a Serbian geographer and ethnologist, president of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences and rector of the University of Belgrade. Cviji\u0107 is considered the founder of geography in Serbia. He began his scientific career as a geographer and geologist, and continued his activity as a human geographer and sociologist. == Early life and family == Cviji\u0107 was born on 1865 in Loznica in the westernmost part of Principality of Serbia. His family was part of the Spasojevi\u0107 branch of the Piva tribe (Pivljani) in Old Herzegovina (currently Montenegro). Cviji\u0107's father, Todor, was a merchant; his grandfather, \u017divko, was head of Loznica and a supporter of the House of Obrenovi\u0107 in Ma\u010dva.\"\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\", \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 1927. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u017divko fought in the 1844 Katana Uprising against the Defenders of the Constitution, and died after torture. Cviji\u0107's great-grandfather, Cvijo Spasojevi\u0107, patriarch of the Cviji\u0107 family, was a well-known hajduk leader in Old Herzegovina and fought the Ottoman Empire in the First Serbian Uprising. After its failure in 1813 he moved to Loznica, built a house and opened a store. His father, Todor (d. 1900) was a trader before accepting a clerkship in the municipality. Cviji\u0107's mother, Marija (born Avramovi\u0107), was from a family in the village of Koremita in the Jadar region (near Trono\u0161a and Tr\u0161i\u0107, the birthplace of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107). Todor and Marija had two sons, \u017divko and Jovan, and three daughters. Cviji\u0107 often said that in his childhood his spiritual education was primarily influenced by his mother and her family; he said less about his father and his father's family. However, in his works on ethnic psychology Cviji\u0107 praised the Dinaric race of his father. == Education == Cviji\u0107 as a young man After completing elementary school Cviji\u0107 attended grammar school in Loznica for two years, in \u0160abac for his third and fourth years, and graduated from the First Belgrade Gymnasium's department of natural sciences and mathematics in 1884. After graduation, he wanted to study medicine, but Loznica could not provide him a scholarship to study abroad. A grammar-school teacher suggested that he attend geography classes at the Velika skola in Belgrade (now the University of Belgrade). Cviji\u0107 took his advice, enrolling in the natural sciences department and graduating in 1889. Cviji\u0107 studied in several languages; in grammar school, he studied English, German and French, which was helpful at university (which had little work translated into Serbian), and wrote his scientific and other papers in those three languages. During the 1888\u201389 school year Cviji\u0107 was a geography teacher at the Second Male Grammar School in Belgrade, and in 1889 enrolled to study physical geography and geology at Vienna University. At that time geomorphology was taught by Albrecht Penck, geotectonics by Professor Sis (president of the Austrian Academy) and climatology by Julius von Hann. House of Jovan Cviji\u0107 in Belgrade, street view Cviji\u0107 received his PhD from Vienna University in 1893. His thesis was Das Karstph\u00e4nomen, introducing him to the scientific world, and was later translated into several languages (into Serbian as Karst in 1895). == Marriage == In 1911, Cviji\u0107 married Ljubica Nikoli\u0107, a widow from Belgrade, n\u00e9e Krsti\u0107 (1879\u20131941). == Research == Cviji\u0107 did his first (and most important) field research in eastern Serbia, observing the structure of the Ku\u010daj mountains and Prekonoska Cave in his PhD thesis (accepted in Vienna on 22 January 1893). Ethnographic map of the Balkans, co- authored by Cviji\u0107 He was interested in geology and geomorphology. Cviji\u0107's monograph on lime karst was well received in European scientific circles, and an introductory academic lecture established him as the first South Slavic tectonicist. The Serbian lime fields had been studied only peripherally by Otto von Pirch (1830), Ami Bou\u00e9 (1840), Felix Philipp Kanitz, Milan Mili\u0107evi\u0107, Jovan \u017dujovi\u0107 and Vladimir Kari\u0107 before him. Cviji\u0107 studied Mid\u017eor and Rila in the Balkan Mountains, recognizing the glacial origin of 102 mountain lakes. It was previously unknown that the region was influenced by the last glacial period, and Cviji\u0107's discovery was a turning point in the study of regional dispersion. Cviji\u0107 conducted a pioneering human-geographical survey in \"Balkan Peninsula 1918\", 1922\u2013I, 1931\u2013II, based on his research of Balkan personality types. He researched for 38 years, leading expeditions in the Balkans, the southern Carpathian Mountains and Anatolia which produced a number of research papers. Cviji\u0107's two-volume Geomorphology is an important starting point for research into the Balkan peninsula. === Karst geomorphology === When studying under Albrecht Penck's tutelage he was encouraged to focus on the study of karst phenomena in the northern Dinaric Alps which was a region Penck was already acknowledged with. His first major work was Das Karstph\u00e4nomen published in 1893. This work was a publication of the key points of his doctoral thesis. Das Karstph\u00e4nomen was published as a slightly modified translation in Serbo-Croat in 1895. This work describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes. In a 1918 publication, Cviji\u0107 proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development. The results of this work written in French were made accessible to English-language scientists in 1921 when it was commented by E.M. Sanders. Differences in climate and geology were used by Cviji\u0107 to explain various shapes and types of karst landforms, sometimes incorrectly. Nevertheless, his views on the role of climate on the development of karst were more accurate than those of various climatic geomorphologists that succeeded him and who greatly exaggerated the role of climate. It has been attributed to Cviji\u0107 that the term karst prevailed over Edouard Martel's proposed term \"Le Causse\". Another terminology usage indebted to Cviji\u0107 is that of doline, a term he introduced, and that overlaps with that of sinkhole. Eventually, Cviji\u0107 emerged as the \"father of karst geomorphology\". === Human geography === Milan Jovanovi\u0107 (1911) In his human-geographical research, Cviji\u0107 studied migrations, village and town habitat, types of housing and the culture of populations in regions influenced by a variety of civilizations, psychological types, folklore and dress. He traveled during difficult social and political times, exposing himself to unpleasant and life-threatening situations (especially in countries under Ottoman and Austrian rule before World War I). During these trips Cviji\u0107 became acquainted with the living conditions of the Balkan population, leading to his interest in ethnographic and psycho-social issues; he noted how little he had known about the difficulty of life in Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia until 1896\u20131898. Until then, he later said, he had little of the interest in folklore, ethnology and national politics he later developed. Cviji\u0107 organized a number of research expeditions to dangerous, unexplored regions. In 1896 Cviji\u0107 published \"Instructions for studying villages in Serbia and other Serbian lands\", which was later revised to apply to other Balkan regions. In Serbia, interest developed in folkloric research; this encouraged the first systematically-gathered data in ethnology. The research was conducted by Cviji\u0107's students and colleagues and interested laypeople (primarily village teachers and priests), constituting a large, unified scientific effort. Cviji\u0107's thesis on the effects of climate and geography on human life is the basis of his approach to human geography, where he emphasizes that humankind is ecologically sensitive. When classifying anthropological types Cviji\u0107 considered social structure (work, endogamy, exogamy and migration) the primary factor, stressing the effects of the physical environment on a population's psyche. His basic concepts are presented in the 1902 Balkan- peninsula paper, \"Human-geography problems\". Influenced by Cviji\u0107's paper, Milorad Dragi\u0107 (a former student) elaborated on psychological anthropological research in his 1911 paper \"Instructions for studying settlements and psychological characteristics\" (after which Cviji\u0107 expanded his thesis on \"The Balkan peninsula and South Slavic lands\" in Serbian). Cviji\u0107 introduced the term 'metanastasic movements', which referred to slow, gradual, a place-to- place human movement. He and his students took wide exploration of this phenomenon, eventually establishing the Serbian ethnological-historic school which gathered ethnological material from all around the Balkan peninsula and encompassed exploration of written sources. The sparking of interest in human- geographical and ethnographical research was one of the greatest achievements of Cviji\u0107's scientific career. His efforts and research helped him gather crucial data, which he used during negotiations on the state borders of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I. ==== Influence on Yugoslav state borders ==== After World War I Cviji\u0107 helped determine the state borders of the new Yugoslav state, using his research in demography and human geography in the negotiations; his data was used in determining the ethnic expansion of the South Slavs. French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache invited Cviji\u0107 to Paris on behalf of the University of Paris twice (in 1917 and at the beginning of 1919), where he lectured on Balkan physical and political geography. At the end of 1918, the Serbian government named him their chief expert on ethnographic borders; in 1919, he was elected president of a unit dealing with territorial issues as part of the state delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Here, with Mihajlo Pupin (another influential scientist), Cviji\u0107's efforts in creating ethnographic charts of the Yugoslav countries in 1918\u20131919 helped determine the borders of a new country: the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was agreed that the new country should incorporate Banat, Ba\u010dka, Baranya and Carniola as well as the Bled triangle (Bled, Bohinj and Triglav). == Teaching == After Cviji\u0107's return from Vienna in March 1893 he became a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy of the Velika Skola in Belgrade, teaching geography, physical geography and ethnography. Traveling as a student and a professor throughout the Balkans later in life, he developed an interest in folklore and culture and organized ethnographical research in the department of geography. After the Velika Skola became the University of Belgrade on 12 October 1905, Cviji\u0107 was one of eight tenured professors; the others were Jovan \u017dujovi\u0107, Sima Lozani\u0107, Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 Alas, Andra Stevanovi\u0107, Dragoljub Pavlovi\u0107, Mili\u0107 Radovanovi\u0107 and Ljubomir Jovanovi\u0107, and they chose other colleagues for tenured positions. Cviji\u0107 played an active role in reforming the school, helping found an ethnography department whose first professor was his oldest student and assistant, Jovan Erdeljanovi\u0107 (followed by Tihomir \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107); Cviji\u0107 remained in the geography department. He was influential in establishing five new faculties: medicine, agriculture and theology in Belgrade, philosophy in Skopje and the Subotica Law School. ==Views== === Critique of education === Cviji\u0107 thought that the grammar-school education of that era should last seven years, instead of eight, and felt that young men should be included early in adult life and independent work. He published detailed instructions for conducting field research into populations and habitats to help his colleagues, including the 1907 article \"On scientific research and our University\". === Territorial expansion === Cviji\u0107' s scientific impartiality has been criticized for his support of Serbia's political advancement; his geographic work was used to scientifically justify politics of territorial expansion and further territorial claims.Jovan Cvijic, Selected statements According to Cviji\u0107, Bulgarians were \"different from the other South Slavs in their ethnic composition\". He described as Slav three ethnographic groups previously considered Bulgarians: the Macedonian Slavs, the Shopi and the Torlaks. Cviji\u0107 excluded the region around Sofia (Bulgaria's capital) from the Bulgarian group, maintained that the aforementioned groups were Slavic (and therefore Serbian).\"The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics\", Ivo Banac, pp. 307\u2013328, Cornell University Press, 1984. He believed that Serbia could govern a much larger area than the territory it held.Cvijic, \"O nacionalnom radu\", commemorative speech 1907, reprinted in Govori i Clanci, I, Beograd 1921 pp. 51\u201376 == Legacy == With a group of geographers and biologists, Cviji\u0107 founded the Serbian Geographic Society in Belgrade in 1910 and was its president until his death. In 1912 he began a magazine, the Serbian Geographic Society Herald, which is still published. Cviji\u0107 conducted weekly seminars for science students, which were also attended by teachers from Belgrade grammar schools. He founded the Faculty of Philosophy's Geographical Institute in 1923 (the first such organization in the Balkans), managing it until his death. Statue of Cviji\u0107 in Belgrade Cviji\u0107's grave In 1947, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts founded the Jovan Cviji\u0107 Geographical Institute in Belgrade to advance the science of geography. On 21\u201322 November 2002, the Academy hosted a meeting on \"the socio-political work of Jovan Cviji\u0107\". The Jovan Cviji\u0107's house is housed in his family's house in Belgrade at 5 Jelena \u0106etkovi\u0107 Street. Since 1996, the house (built in 1905) has been declared a cultural monument by the state and was decorated by Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak; Cviji\u0107 favored a decorative style based on Balkan folklore. The museum features manuscripts, letters, notes, books, paintings, geographical charts, atlases and personal items, and occasional lectures are presented. In Serbia, a number of schools and streets are named after Cviji\u0107 and he is still considered the most important Serbian geographer. His work has been continued by his students, six of whom later became members of the Serbian Academy (including Pavle Vujevi\u0107, Borivoje Z. Milojevi\u0107 and Milisav Lutovac). The scientist's life and work were researched by geographer Milorad Vasovi\u0107 for his 454-page book, Jovan Cviji\u0107: Scientist, Public Worker, Statesman (1994). == Academic honors == Internation medals awarded to Cviji\u0107 Cviji\u0107 received a number of awards. He belonged to 30 scientific societies (academies, geographical and natural societies), receiving ten decorations. Cviji\u0107 received a gold medal for his work in 1924 from the New York Geographical Society and medals from England and France. Two varieties of saffron were named after him. Cviji\u0107 was awarded: *1917: Medal of Geographical society of Paris *1918: Medal of the Charles University in Prague *1920: Patron's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society *1924: Cullum Geographical Medal *1924: Medal of the Paris-Sorbonne University *1924: Gold medal of the American geographical society, New York Cviji\u0107 was named: *Honorary doctor, University of Paris *Honorary doctor, Charles University in Prague *Member of the Serbian Royal Academy *Member of the Czech Academy *Member of the Academy in Brussels *Corresponding Member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb *Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Italy *Corresponding Member of the Parmasus Science Association, Athens *Corresponding Member of the Russian Geographical Society, Saint Petersburg *Corresponding Member of geographical societies in Budapest, Vienna, Geneva, Warsaw, Bucharest, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam and London *Honorary president of the Congress of Geographers and Ethnologists, Prague (1922) *President of the Serbian Royal Academy from 12 April 1921 until his death in 1927 *Rector of the University of Belgrade (twice) == Works == Monument to Jovan Cviji\u0107 in Academy Park, Belgrade In more than 30 years of scientific study, Cviji\u0107 published many works.
