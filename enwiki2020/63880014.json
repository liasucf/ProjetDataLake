Hayes came to St John's College, Oxford as an Overseas Scholar in 1955. At St John's, he was Fellow and Tutor from 1960 to 1987; and Principal Bursar from 1977 to 1987. Hayes was a University Lecturer from 1962 to 1985, and Professor from 1985 to 1987. Hayes was President of St John's College, Oxford'University news' The Times Saturday, Mar. 1, 1986 Issue 62393 p.10 from 1987 to 2001. He was Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1990 to 2001. Hayes specialised in crystals, and studied imperfections in crystals and defects in solids. He investigated the spectroscopic signatures of imperfections in alkali halides and semiconductors, using varied research techniques that included inelastic light scattering (Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy), magneto-optics (Zeeman effect), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagoetic resonance (EPR) and muon spin resonance (mu-SR). His publications included the books: * Scattering of Light by Crystals (co- written with Rodney Loudon) * Defects and Defect Processes in Nonmetallic Solids (co-written with A.M. Stoneham) In 1990 he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society for \"creative applications of spectroscopy and laser techniques to the understanding of defects in solids. phase transitions, and semi-conductor physics\" Hayes married Joan Ferris in 1962. Their marriage produced three children, and lasted until her death in 1996. ==References== ==External links== * St John's College, Oxford page on William Hayes * Department of Physics, Oxford University page on William Hayes * 'William Hayes, Honorary Degree Recipient'.
