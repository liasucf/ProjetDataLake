    "text": "Blind Man's Eyes is a 1919 American silent drama film directed by John Ince and starring Bert Lytell, Frank Currier, and Naomi Childers. It was released on March 10, 1919. ==Plot== Hugh Overton has been falsely convicted of the murder of Matthew Latrone and sent to prison. In order to clear his name, he escapes and heads back to the scene of the crime, traveling under the name of Philip Eaton. While on the train he runs into Basil Santoine, a blind attorney who he knows has the evidence to prove his innocence. Latrone has also learned of Overton's trip and has sent his henchman, Donald Avery, to dispose of Eaton. Unfortunately, Avery mistakes Santoine for Eaton and attempts to kill him, but simply leaves him unconscious. When he awakes, Santoine suspects Eaton, due to his voice, who he had heard earlier in the evening, and which he remembered as he was one of the witnesses at Overton's trial. Santoine invite him back to his home, in order to figure out what his role is in everything. While under Santoine's roof, Eaton/Overton falls in love with Harriet, Basil's daughter, who refers to her as his \"eyes\", hence she is the \"blind man's eyes\". Overton knows that Santoine has evidence in his safe which will prove his innocence. Latrone, who everyone thinks is dead, also knows this. Both men attempt to break into Santoine's safe on the same night. Overton and Latrone struggle, but Latrone is shot and killed by Avery, who had come as backup to his employer. The evidence comes to light, and Overton is declared innocent, after which he and Harriet become a couple. ==Cast== * Bert Lytell as Hugh Overton, aka Philip D.
