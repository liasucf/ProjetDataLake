    "text": "Spotlight on Nilsson is the debut album by Harry Nilsson. It is essentially a compilation of all four of the singles (and their respective B-Sides) that were released during his tenure on the Tower label (1964\u20131966), plus two previously unreleased tracks. It has been re-issued numerous times over the years with different sleeves, attempting to capitalize on his later success at RCA. It was released on Pickwick as Rock 'N' Roll, without \"The Path That Leads to Trouble.\" The track \"Good Times\" would be later covered by the Monkees as the title track for their 2016 reunion album. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Harry Nilsson; except where indicated #\"The Path That Leads to Trouble\" (Johnny Cole) \u2013 2:08 - with The New Salvation Singers #\"Good Times\" \u2013 1:50 - with The New Salvation Singers #\"So You Think You've Got Troubles\" (Marvin Rainwater) \u2013 2:20 #\"I'm Gonna Lose My Mind\" (Johnny Cole) \u2013 2:06 #\"She's Yours\" (Nilsson, J.R.
