His two sons, Jovo and Lazo started trading business and established trading connections with Trieste. Their descendants continued trading business but were also active in political and cultural life, some of them being actors in theater. Members of Radulovi\u0107's family participated in the uprisings of 1875 and 1882 so Radulovi\u0107 was brought up as an enemy of Austria-Hungary. == Editorial work == In 1897 Radulovi\u0107 was an editor of the school paper \"Serbdom\" () published since Summer of 1896 by the \"Serb consciousness\" (), \u0430 secret students' society of the Gymnasium in Mostar established in Autumn of 1895. In 1897 Radulovi\u0107 was the first student who was expelled from Mostar school. At the beginning of 1907 a group of Serb intellectuals in Mostar began publishing of the journal \"People\" () which was edited by Radulovi\u0107. Radulovi\u0107 closely collaborated with Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107, Svetozar \u0106orovi\u0107, Atanasije \u0160ola and other notable Mostar intellectuals, and was also very active in Gusle Singing Society.

In his article, Radulovi\u0107 explained that he did not see glorious moments of the nation nor a single tragedy which he believed was necessary to temper the struggle. When \u017deraji\u0107 read these words he yelled \"There will be a tragedy!\". Radulovi\u0107 was the central figure of anti occupational movement before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria Members of Young Bosnia followed his political course. Still, he disagreed with their glorification of the peasantry. He believed that authentic nationalism is cultural phenomenon connected with educated people in enlightened civic societies.
