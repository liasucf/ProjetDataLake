Playbill. 19 October 2011. http://www.playbill.com/article/sandi-patty-will-sing-hello-dolly-with-gary- beach-as-her-quarry-in-indy-symphony-concert-com-183731 and expressive flexibility, which has led music critics to dub her \"The Voice\". ==Biography == ===Early life=== Patty was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, into a family of musicians; her father was a minister of music, and her mother served as the church pianist. She first performed at the age of two when she sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" for her church, Phoenix First Church of God (Anderson, Indiana). First growing up in Phoenix, then San Diego, she and her brothers joined their parents in a performing group known as \"The Ron Patty Family\", and sang at churches nationwide during summer holidays. After graduating from Crawford High School in San Diego, she attended San Diego State University and Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana, where she studied voice with soprano Greta Dominic, but graduated with an emphasis in conducting. While studying at Anderson University, she worked as a studio musician for area recording studios, singing background vocals and recording commercial jingles, including one for Juicy Fruit gum. Her reputation as a performer and studio singer grew during the late 1970s, and it was during this time that she initiated contact with legendary Christian musician Bill Gaither. ===Singing career=== Patty recorded her first album, For My Friends, an independent effort, that landed in the hands of executives at Singspiration! records. In 1979, she was signed to Singspiration! and released her first professional record, Sandi's Song. According to the FAQ section on her website, the name on her birth certificate is Sandra Patty. A printer's error on the labeling listed her name as Sandi Patti, and she used this moniker as her stage name for the next fifteen years, before correcting it to Sandi Patty. Patty's career expanded after she won her first two GMA Dove Awards in 1982 and began singing backup for Bill Gaither and the Bill Gaither Trio. She headlined her first national tour in 1984 and reached national acclaim after her rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was included during the ABC Statue of Liberty re-dedication broadcast on July 6, 1986. This exposure led to multiple mainstream television appearances including The Tonight Show, Christmas in Washington, Walt Disney's Fourth of July Extravaganza, and the 1998 Pepsi 400; the clip was frequently used on television sign-offs for the remainder of their existence. She was invited to sing the national anthem at the Indianapolis 500 in 1987\u201388, 1990\u201392, and once again in 2013. In 1990, Patty's inspirational single release, \"I'll Give You Peace\", written by Constant Change aka Dawn Thomas and Thomas Yarbrough, was released on one of her most popular records, entitled, \"Another Time, Another Place\", which peaked at #2 on the Christian billboard charts. At the peak of her career, Patty's concerts were so heavily attended that she performed in often sold-out mainstream arenas and concert halls across the United States. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she averaged over 200 concerts a year and supported a staff of over 30 that managed her career. During this period of time Patty was noted, often critically, as the highest-paid singer in the Christian music industry averaging over $100,000 per appearance, largely due to massive touring and high-profile public appearances. ===Divorce=== In 1992, the news of Patty's divorce from manager John Helvering shocked the gospel music industry. The reason for the split was later revealed to be infidelity which subsequently stalled her career in the mid 1990s. It was later reported that during her marriage she had an extramarital affair with her backup singer, Don Peslis, who was also married at the time. Patty divorced Helvering in 1993 and married Peslis in August 1995. Confronted with rumors of the affair just two weeks into her marriage with Peslis, Patty made a full confession to her church congregation. During this time, Patty received support from national figure, Charles Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts comic strip. He referenced her in a comic strip, and Patty is quoted in a recent spiritual biography of Schulz as having been touched by the gesture.Lind, Stephen J. \"A Charlie Brown Religion: Exploring the Spiritual Life and Work of Charles M. Schulz\" Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2015 ===Comeback=== Patty slowly rebuilt her career by expanding her musical appeal which included pop concert performances with symphony orchestras including the New York Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Prague Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Pops, and the Dallas Symphony as well as headlining and hosting the Yuletide Celebration with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2015 under the direction of Maestro Jack Everly. Patty again hosted the extravaganza in December 2017. In both interviews and in her autobiography, Broken on the Back Row, Patty expressed remorse and took full responsibility for her past actions, revealing the steps she took in seeking the forgiveness from those that her actions most affected. In 2000, Patty had a guest singing appearance at the end of a 7th Heaven episode (season 4, episode 20). She appeared in the 2006 annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. A televised performance of Sandi Patty's Yuletide Special was filmed for syndication in 2006, with other performers\u2014including the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the U.S. Air Force Reserve Band. In 2004, Patty was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and in 2007 was awarded the GMA Music in the Rockies Summit Award. In May 2008, Patty released her 30th studio recording, Songs for the Journey, in which she covers classic hymns of the church and other modern gospel classics. 2008 also saw the release of five separate compilation recordings of past songs taken from previous albums. In 2009, Patty received two GMA Dove Award nominations: Female Vocalist of the Year, and Inspirational Album of the Year (Songs for the Journey). Simply Sandi, an acoustic album, is the first solo project to be released on her own record label, Stylos Records (a label with three artists\u2014Sandi, Ben Utecht, and Heather Payne). It was released on May 5, 2009. This album includes new renditions of some of Sandi's most beloved songs including \"In Heaven's Eyes\", \"Via Dolorosa\" and \"The Stage is Bare\". WEA Distribution is the distributor for Stylos Records, although this album is not being released commercially. In Fall 2009, Patty released her first live Christmas album entitled Christmas: LIVE. The album includes live performances of her past Christmas favorites including \"O Holy Night\", \"Someday\", and a duet with her husband Don Peslis in \"The Prayer\". ===2010\u2013present=== In Fall 2010, Patty released The Edge of the Divine. The album featured eight new songs, including a duet with Heather Payne. A book of the same name was also released with the sub-title \"Where Possibility Meets God's Faithfulness.\" In October 2011, Patty released Broadway Stories which capitalized on Patty's pops concerts popularity. From iTunes Review: \"Before Sandi Patty was a Christian music star, she developed her craft by performing stage standards and pop tunes from the Great American Songbook. Broadway Stories reaffirms her mastery of such material against gorgeous backdrops provided by the 64-piece Prague Symphony Orchestra. From the first track to the last, Patty shows an easy command of the Broadway idiom, applying her formidable pipes to material worthy of her talents.\" In January, 2012, Patty starred as Dolly Levi in the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra's world premiere concert stage version of the Broadway musical, \"Hello, Dolly!\" to rave reviews. In 2012 and 2013, Patty was a judge and mentor for the Songbook Academy, a summer intensive for high school students operated by the Great American Songbook Foundation and founded by Michael Feinstein.http://www.broadwayworld.com/indianapolis/article/Michael-Feinstein- Sylvia-McNair-et-al-to-Judge-Songbook-Vocal-Competition-612-20120604 broadwayworld.com Retrieved 21 July 2015 In 2015, Patty announced her retirement from touring, citing age and a desire to spend time with grandchildren. In 2016, Patty released Forever Grateful, an album of new and re-recorded material, and embarked on a farewell tour of the same title between February 2016 through March 2017. She is currently the Artist in Residence at Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City, OK. In 2020, Patty announced she had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). She released a video urging her fans to take the disease seriously and practice social distancing, handwashing, etc., adding, \"This is NOT fake news!\" https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/march/sandi-patty- covid-19-coronavirus-positive-not-fake-news.html ==Style and voice== Patty is known for her wide vocal range, flexibility, and emotional expression. In her early recordings, she created a trademark for herself by exploiting her range to its fullest advantage, through the \"power ballad\" vehicle, sweeping orchestral gestures, and a series of key modulations building to a crescendo and signature high vocal ending. This style, often defined as \"Inspirational\" within the genre of Christian music, flourished throughout the 1980s, and influenced a range of additional CCM artists including Steve Green, Larnelle Harris, and Karla Worley. In later years, Patty's versatility has allowed her to expand into other styles, such as black gospel, southern gospel, classic and modern pop, and American musical theater. On her official website, she discusses her range saying \"To be honest, my range has changed a bit over the years but my mom says it\u2019s about four octaves (F below middle C to high F above double high C; F3 - F6). Really, singing high is just like screaming on pitch.\" ==Personal life== In 2009, Patty and her family relocated from Anderson, Indiana, to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She is married to Don Peslis. As a blended family, they have eight children and three grandchildren. Patty has supported charities such as Charity Music Inc.http://www.charitymusic.orghttps://www.looktothestars.org/charity/charity- music ==Discography== *1978: Sandi Patty \u2013 For My Friends (Burlap Sound Inc., Anderson, Indiana) *1979: Sandi's Song *1981: Love Overflowing *1982: Lift Up the Lord *1983: Live: More Than Wonderful *1983: Christmas: The Gift Goes On *1984: Songs from the Heart *1985: Hymns Just for You *1986: Morning Like This *1988: Make His Praise Glorious *1989: The Finest Moments *1989: Sandi Patti and The Friendship Company *1990: Another Time...Another Place *1991: The Friendship Company: Open for Business *1992: Hallmark Christmas: Celebrate Christmas! *1993: Le Voyage *1994: Find It On the Wings (released under Sandi Patty) *1996: O Holy Night!
