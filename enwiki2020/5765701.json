DanceSport Alberta was founded in 1989 as a non-profit organization. In addition to Alberta, it has jurisdiction over Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories, which do not have their own amateur associations. Prior to 1989, dancers on the Canadian prairies belonged to the Western Canadian Amateur Ballroom Dance Association (WCABDA); DanceSport Alberta was formed when the WCABDA became DanceSport BC (British Columbia and Yukon only).
