    "text": "Guillaume Le Breton (sometimes also called Gabriel) was a French dramatist of the sixteenth century. Little is known of his life, although the title of his play Adonis mentions he was from the Ni\u00e8vre region. Like his contemporary Fran\u00e7ois d'Amboise, he associated himself with the king's Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Gilles Bourdin, as well as other dramatists of the period, such as Odet de Turn\u00e8be and Pierre de Larivey. According to Fran\u00e7ois d'Amboise, Le Breton wrote several tragedies -- Tullie, Charit\u00e9, Didon and Doroth\u00e9e -- which are today lost. His only extant theatrical work is a mythological play entitled Adonis, which was probably produced in 1569 before Charles IX, then again eight years later at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, and finally in 1579 at the Coll\u00e8ge de Boncourt. Le Breton was also responsible for a translation of the travels of Cort\u00e9s. ==Works== Original editions: * Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, Voyages et conquestes du capitaine Ferdinand Courtois, es Indes occidentales, histoire traduite de la langue espagnole par Guillaume le Breton, Paris, A.
