It grows to about high by wide and has purple, lavender or white coloured flowers and fine foliage. The Latin word hyssopifolia (which also occurs in several other plant names, including that of Bassia hyssopifolia) means \"hyssop-leafed\".James Donn, Hortus Cantabrigiensis: or, a Catalogue of Plants, Indigenous and Exotic (1809), p. 5 The species is naturalised in Hawaii, and regarded as a serious weed there. In cultivation, the species adapts to a range of soils in a sunny or partially shaded situation with good drainage. It can be cultivated outdoors in USDA hardiness zones 8B-11. In colder regions it may be cultivated as an annual. Plants may be propagated by cuttings, layering or division. They seed freely, and new seedlings that appear are easily transplanted. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).
