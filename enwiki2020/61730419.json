    "text": "Leo Gauriloff (5 October 1956 \u2013 23 August 2019) (original Russian surname: Gavrilov, ) was a Skolt S\u00e1mi singer, guitarist and composer. He was known mainly for playing acoustic steel string guitars, but he also played other acoustic string instruments, such the sambur, the mandola, the buzuki, as well as synthesizers. Gauriloff grew up in Mustola, Inari, in the vicinity of Nellim. He lost his mother in an act of murder, which upset the whole village. He was then raised by his grandmother, from whom he learnt the Skolt S\u00e1mi language. Gauriloff built his first guitar from particle board, and he would amplify the sound by pressing it against the boiling pot of the sauna. There were others, too, in the family who had an active interest in cultural matters. Music became the choice of career for Leo Gauriloff and his older brother Jaakko (b. 1939). Their niece Katja Gauriloff became a well-known film director. Hopes were placed in Leo Gauriloff that he would become the first Skolt S\u00e1mi teacher and that we would take up teaching the language at Sevettij\u00e4rvi. After he had completed his high school studies in the Kuopio Senior High of Music and Dance, he began his studies at Oulu University. However, he never completed them, and he ended up in Tampere and the local music circles. He never forgot his Skolt S\u00e1mi roots and he would sometimes sing in Skolt S\u00e1mi, along with Finnish. He would borrow the musical form from various forms of popular music, e.g. the blues, but his scale in singing was wide, and included ditties and ethic music. Leo Gauriloff toured with Nils- Aslak Valkeap\u00e4\u00e4 ja Paroni Paakkunainen. He played the guitar on Valkeap\u00e4\u00e4's records entitled S\u00e1mi eatnan duoddariid (1978) and Davas ja Geassai (1982). Gauriloff was known especially for performing together with Mikko Perkoila. He played on seven of Perkoila's album releases. But he also played with Heikki Lund and Kiti Neuvonen and had a short stint with Piirpauke in 1984. Gauriloff also played with Jukka Tervo in the guitar duo Tervo & Gauriloff in the 1970s and 1980s, both in clubs and on major festivals in Finland, such as Provinssirock in Sein\u00e4joki in 1980 and in the Suistomaan soittop\u00e4iv\u00e4t in Pori in 1981. Gauriloff also played second guitar in the documentary film called Kurki josta ei tullut lintua (\u2018The crane that never became a bird\u2019, 1981). Juice Leskinen Grand Slam released a single with the pseudonym of Trio Jyrkk\u00e4kallio, a single with the title \u201cKissa ja korttipakka\u201d (\u2018The cat and a pack of cards\u2019) (1985). Gauriloff composed the music to the play Skoavdnji, which told about the fate of the Skolt S\u00e1mi in World War II and which was premiered in the S\u00e1mi theatre Beaivv\u00e1\u0161 in 1994. During 1992\u20131993 Gauriloff worked with Ahaa Teatteri, which is specialized in children's and youth theater. Around the turn of the millennia Gauriloff moved to Stockholm, where he worked as a musician as well as in day care centers. He died of cancer at the age of 62. == References == Category:Finnish Sami musicians Category:Finnish guitarists Category:Skolts Category:1956 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Gauriloff family Category:Finnish expatriates in Sweden ",
