Bernal was also a leader of the Bolivarian Circles. ==Controversy== In an 18 March 2015 interview with Globovisi\u00f3n, Bernal was asked \"Can a homosexual be a police officer?\" to where he replied, \"Yes ... so long as they don\u2019t manifest their sexual preference publicly. Because imagine if a police officer that might want to wear a pink shirt, or wear lipstick. I think that that, at least in Venezuela, I don\u2019t know in other places, doesn\u2019t go with our culture.\" He then attempted to clarify, stating \"I have nothing against sexual diversity ... But they couldn\u2019t manifest it publicly, because it goes against the structure of what a police officer should be.\" Bernal's remarks raised concerns of homophobia in Venezuela among the Venezuelan and the international LGBT communities. ===Sanctions=== Bernal has been sanctioned by several countries. ====Canada==== Canada sanctioned 40 Venezuelan officials, including Bernal, in September 2017.
