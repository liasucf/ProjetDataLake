    "text": "Josta was a soft drink brand that was produced by PepsiCo and the first energy drink ever introduced by a major US beverage company. Josta's flavor has been described as predominantly fruity, with a hint of spice and a touch of the key ingredient guaran\u00e1. It was marketed as a \"high-energy drink\" with guaran\u00e1 and caffeine. Josta was introduced in 1995, but PepsiCo pulled the drink from its lineup due to a change in corporate strategy in 1999. Shortly before the beverage was discontinued, an \"Association for Josta Saving\" was started. A \"Save Josta\" campaign was also launched by fans of the drink; their website \"www.savejosta.com\" was defunct for several years but was reactivated in 2011. ==Advertising== Josta used the slogan \"better do the good stuff now.\" In a commercial for Josta an old man speaks to a younger man. The older man tells the younger man about his life as a youth, and how he wished he had more fun.Josta at snackmemory.com ==References== Category:PepsiCo soft drinks Category:Energy drinks Category:American soft drinks Category:Products introduced in 1995 Category:Defunct brands ",
