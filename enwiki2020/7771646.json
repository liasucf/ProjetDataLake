    "text": "Charles Marie Louis Joseph Sarrabezolles (December 27, 1888 \u2013 February 11, 1971), also known as Carlo Sarrabezolles (or Charles or Charles-Marie), was a French sculptor. Carlo Sarrabezolles (1888-1971), statue of Victory at Hell- Bourg, in the Hauts de la R\u00e9union. ==Life== Sarrabezolles was born in Toulouse, studied at that city's \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts (1904\u20131907), then from 1907 to 1914 at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he settled for good. In 1914 he was runner-up (premier second) in Prix de Rome competition. From 1914 to 1918, during World War I, he was held prisoner in Germany. In 1920 he married Nicole Cervi, with whom he had three children. In 1923 they moved into a studio at 16 rue des Volontaires where he remained until his death. A square there, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, bears his name. 16 rue des Volontaires (Paris 15\u00e8me) His best-known work is probably The Soul of France, which he executed in three different materials: the first in plaster in 1921, the second in stone in 1922, and the last in bronze in 1930. In 1926 the sculptor developed a method of direct carving in setting concrete, and much of his subsequent work was integrated with architecture, particularly in collaboration with architect Paul Tournon, and in monumental scale. Sarrabezolles was a member or president of artistic associations including Art Monumental, the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais, and the Foundation Taylor. == Selected works == * 1920\u20131922 \u2013 first monumental work, The Soul of France, winning National Prize and silver medal at the Salon * 1925 \u2013 The Triumphal Dance of Pallas Athena and The Virgin of Peace exhibited at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes * 1926 \u2013 tower, Villemomble Church (Seine-St-Denis).
