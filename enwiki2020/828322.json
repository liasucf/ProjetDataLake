    "text": "Merritt Island Airport is a general aviation public airport under the administration of the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority. It located in Merritt Island, Brevard County, Florida, USA, northwest of Patrick Air Force Base. ==History== In the early 1940s, the Brevard County Mosquito Control District constructed the Central Brevard Airport. The airfield included two sod landing strips: (1) a north-south strip measuring approximately 1,800 feet in length; and, (2) a northwest southeast strip measuring approximately 3,000 feet in length. An operations building and maintenance hangar were located on the south side of the airfield and the Mosquito Control District had a maintenance hangar on the north side of the airfield. The north-south landing strip was eventually abandoned, replaced by various facilities such as T-hangars that currently occupy this area. The Brevard County Mosquito Control District subsequently deeded the Central Brevard Airport property over to the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority in exchange for ten acres of land located within Space Coast Regional Airport. Central Brevard Airport was renamed Merritt Island Airport and became a public general aviation facility. ==Facilities== Merritt Island Airport runway Merritt Island Airport covers and has one runway: * Runway 11/29: , Surface: asphalt ===Government Activities=== * Brevard County Sheriff's Office Aviation Unit ===Businesses=== * Space Coast Aviation Merritt Island's FBO * International Pilot training located at Merritt Island Airport * Aerocomp, an airplane manufacturer is located at the Merritt Island Airport. * Baer Air offers aircraft charters and has a base at the airport. * Voyager Aviation International offers flight training. * Sebastian Communication Inc.
