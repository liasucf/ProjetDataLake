Dutcher joined then-interim coach Fisher in 1989 when Michigan won the national championship. Dutcher is credited for having a central role in recruiting the Fab Five to Michigan and for bringing Kawhi Leonard to San Diego State. Dutcher was named San Diego State's \"head coach in waiting\" in 2011. Following Fisher's decision to retire, Dutcher was formally named as his replacement on April 11, 2017. Thanks to Dutcher bringing in transfers Malachi Flynn, Yanni Wetzell, K.J. Feagin, and Trey Pulliam, along with the development of returnees Matt Mitchell, Jordan Shackel, Nathan Mensah, and Adam Sieko, the Aztecs started the 2019-20 season 26-0, with impressive road/neutral site wins over BYU, Creighton, Iowa, and Utah State - the preseason Mountain West favorite. This resulted in a #4 ranking for five straight weeks for SDSU while Dutcher was named to the Naismith Coach of the Year Late-Season Watch List. Dutcher was named Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year on March 3, 2020. ==Personal life== Dutcher and his wife, Jan, have two daughters: Erin and Liza.
