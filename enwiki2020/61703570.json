    "text": "Stephanie Weirich ( ) is an American computer scientist specializing in type theory, type inference, dependent types, and functional programming. She is a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. Weirich graduated magna cum laude in 1996 from Rice University, with a bachelor's degree in computer science. At Rice, she became interested in programming languages through an undergraduate research project with Matthias Felleisen. She moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, completing her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation, Programming with Types, was supervised by Greg Morrisett. She joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty in 2002. Weirich's work on type inference has been incorporated into the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. She has also been a leader of the POPLmark challenge for benchmarking type systems of programming languages. Weirich won the Robin Milner Young Researcher Award of ACM SIGPLAN in 2016. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American computer scientists Category:American women computer scientists Category:Programming language researchers Category:Rice University alumni Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania faculty ",
