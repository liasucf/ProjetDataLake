He is probably best remembered for commanding the destroyer in World War II during an intense Japanese kamikaze attack. ==Early life== Becton was born in Des Arc, Arkansas, on May 15, 1908 to John E. and Ruby Brown Becton. He attended Hot Springs High School. ==Naval career== ===Pre-war=== Becton graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1931 and was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy on June 4 of that year. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) exactly three years later and to lieutenant on July 1, 1939. He served on the battleships and , then the destroyers and , the gunboat , and the destroyers and . ===World War II=== When the United States entered World War II, Becton was the executive officer of the destroyer . He was promoted to lieutenant commander on June 15, 1942. On April 7, 1943, now in command of Aaron Ward, he was escorting three landing craft tanks to Savo Island. As they approached Tulagi harbor, he was ordered to go to the aid of USS LST-449 off Togoma Point, Guadalcanal. One of the passengers aboard the Landing Ship, Tank was then-Lieutenant (junior grade) John F. Kennedy, on his way to take command of Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109. While escorting LST-449 and several other small craft to safety, Aaron Ward was attacked by three Aichi D3A \"Val\" dive bombers, then three more bombers. Aaron Ward sustained such damage that she sank that evening. The casualties were 20 men killed, 59 wounded and seven missing. Becton was awarded the first of four Silver Stars \"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Operations Officer on the Staff of Commander, Destroyer Squadron Twenty-one\" in combat in night engagements in the Solomon Islands campaign in July and August 1943. Made a commander on November 1, Becton was the commanding officer of USS Laffey during the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. The ship was struck by an 8-inch shell, which did not explode. Laffey broke up an attack by German E-boats on June 12 and bombarded Cherbourg on June 25. Becton was awarded a second Silver Star for his actions in June. Transferred back to the Pacific Theater, he received his third Silver Star for his handling of Laffey in support of the landing of the 77th Division at Ormoc Bay, Leyte, the Philippines, on December 7, 1944. His fourth was for entering the \"restricted waters of Lingayen Gulf during the initial bombardment and assault at Luzon\" in January 1945. In February, Laffey escorted aircraft carriers in airstrikes against Tokyo. On April 16, 1945, Laffey came under attack from 22 or 30 Japanese kamikaze and bomber aircraft while on radar picket duty off Okinawa. In a battle lasting 79 minutes, the ship was struck by five, six or eight kamikazes and two bombs, but Becton refused to abandon his ship. For his \"unremitting tenacity of purpose, courageous leadership and heroic devotion to duty under fire\", Becton was awarded the Navy Cross. The ship had to be towed to Seattle.Among his other decorations were the Croix de Guerre with Gold Star, awarded by the French government, and two Presidential Unit Citations. ===Post-war=== On January 1, 1951, Becton was promoted to captain. He became a rear admiral effective December 1, 1959. Becton retired from the navy in 1966 and moved with his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Reuss) to her hometown of Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. He wrote a book about Laffey entitled The Ship That Would Not Die, published by Prentice- Hall in 1980. ==Death== Becton died at the age of 87 on Christmas Day 1995 at his home in Wynnewood. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by Elizabeth, his wife of 46 years, and their two daughters. ==Award citations== ===Navy Cross=== > The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting > the Navy Cross to Commander Frederick Julian Becton (NSN: 0-70065), United > States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line > of this profession as Commanding Officer of the Destroyer U.S.S.
