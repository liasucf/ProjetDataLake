    "text": "This list of dinosaur specimens preserved with agonistic or feeding traces enumerates those dinosaur specimens which bear traces of aggressive behavior or evidence that the specimen was fed upon by another animal prior to fossilization. Traces preserved in bone that shows signs of healing confirm that the injury was obtained during life and can be a considered a pathology. Traces that show no sign of healing may have been inflicted either too shortly before death for healing to occur or afterwards, and therefore cannot technically be demonstrated to be pathologies. ==Theropods== ===Dromaeosaurs=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" |- !
