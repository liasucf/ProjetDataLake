It is the northern terminal of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. === History === This elevated station opened on August 15, 1896 to connect with the adjacent Franklin Avenue station of the Fulton Street Elevated (see ). It was a replacement for the August 18, 1878-built Bedford Terminal station originally built by the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway. It was a two-track through station with side platforms and the point where steam railroad trains from the Fulton Street Line turned onto the BMT Brighton Line to access Brighton Beach. The station also had a connection with the Franklin Avenue Line streetcars, as well as Fulton Street Line streetcars. In 1920, the track connection to the Fulton Street Line was severed as Brighton Line trains to Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan were rerouted via a new tunnel under Flatbush Avenue. In 1924, the station was rebuilt as a single-track station. The former westbound (now northbound) track was decked over with a wood platform to accommodate crowds transferring between the Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue Lines. The station platforms were also extended south to accommodate longer trains. Originally accommodated for five elevated BU cars for a length of ~250 ft (~76 m), they were now able to hold six subway-type AB Standard cars for a length of ~402 feet (~123 m). The next stop to the south was Dean Street but only for Brighton Line trains. The next stop to the west was Grand Avenue. When the BMT system was taken over by the City of New York on June 1, 1940, the Fulton Street Elevated Line was closed and later demolished while paper transfers were issued at Franklin Avenue for passengers to access the new IND Fulton Street Line subway. In 1985, the station had only 210 paying daily riders on a typical weekday in 1985 not counting farebeaters, making it one of the least used stations in the system. === Rehabilitation === Platform awaiting shuttle train This station was completely rebuilt between 1998 and 1999 as a single- track station with a single platform on the west side of the track. The new platform is only long and can accommodate a train of two -long cars, or three -long cars. The track ends at a bumper block at the north end of the platform. The 1999 artwork here is called Life and Continued Growth by Eric Pryor. It consists of stained glass panels on the top of the entranceway to the shuttle platform. ===Exit=== At the north end of the platform is the station's main station house, a three-story building on the southwest corner of Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue that connects to both platforms of Franklin Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line. One up-only escalator and one long staircase go down to the fare control area at ground level, where one staircase goes down to the southbound IND platform and one turnstile bank provides access to/from the station. A set of doors then lead out to the streets after the token booth. The shuttle platform has another short staircase that goes down to a mesh- enclosed bridge above Fulton Street. On the other end is an elevator and one staircase going down to the northbound IND platform. A second elevator from the shuttle platform goes down to the overpass, main fare control area, and the southbound IND platform. These two elevators make the entire station complex ADA-accessible. == IND Fulton Street Line platforms == Franklin Avenue is an underground local station on the IND Fulton Street Line. ===History=== The Franklin Avenues station was constructed as part of the IND Fulton Street Line, the main line of the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND)'s main line from Downtown Brooklyn to southern Queens. The groundbreaking for the line was held on April 16, 1929, at Fulton Street and Arlington Place. This station opened on April 9, 1936, as part of an extension of the Independent Subway System (IND) from its previous Brooklyn terminus at Jay Street\u2013Borough Hall, which opened three years earlier, to Rockaway Avenue. The new IND subway replaced the BMT Fulton Street Elevated, and this station replaced its namesake Franklin Avenue, which closed on May 31, 1940. ===Station layout=== Opened on April 9, 1936, it has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are used by the A train during daytime hours. Both platforms have a lime green trim line on a dark green border with small \"FRANKLIN\" signs below them in white lettering on a black border. The name tablets read \"FRANKLIN AVE.\" in white sans serif font on dark green background and lime green border. Directional signs are underneath them. Prior to introduction of the MetroCard, the Euclid Avenue-bound platform had a same- level fare control and a paper bus-style transfer was handed out at either IND fare control areas (the only place in the subway where this was still being done) for access to the shuttle station only. After the MetroCard was introduced, a paper MetroCard transfer was issued from a machine that resembled a bus farebox. These transfers were good for 20 minutes and were discontinued after construction of the in-system transfer. ===Exits=== Fare control areas are at the extreme east (railroad south) end of the platforms. On the Manhattan-bound side, there is an unstaffed turnstile bank and one staircase going up to the northeast corner of Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street. Inside fare control, one staircase and one elevator go up to the overpass above Fulton Street that connects to the shuttle platform. On the Euclid Avenue-bound platform, a staircase goes up to the main station house, where a connection to the Franklin Avenue Shuttle is available. An elevator from the platform goes up to the shuttle platform with intermediate stops at the main station house and overpass. Directional signs obscured with paint, along with newly tiled rooms, point to evidence of a closed exits on the west (railroad north) end of the station, which went to both eastern corners of Classon Avenue and Fulton Street. These exits were closed in the 1980s. The exit to the Manhattan-bound platform is blocked by a trapdoor, while the exit to the eastbound platform is completely sealed. == BMT Fulton Street Line platforms == This original elevated station at this intersection opened on April 24, 1888 along the demolished BMT Fulton Street Line. It was originally built by the Kings County Elevated Railway, and was not only one of the original stations along the line, but the penultimate station, until it was extended to Albany and Sumner Avenues the next month, Rockaway Avenue by the end of the year, Van Siclen Avenue in 1889, Montauk Avenue in 1892, and Grant Avenue in 1894. In 1896, the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad connected the former BF&CI; line to the station. It was a two-track through station with side platforms, gaining a third track along the south side at the point where steam railroad trains from the Fulton Street Line turned onto the BMT Brighton Line to access Brighton Beach. The southern platform was shared with the northbound Brighton Line platform, with the different sections of the platform located at right angles. As with the Franklin Street platforms, the station also had a connection with the Franklin Avenue Line streetcars. When the extension of the Montague Street Tunnel under Flatbush Avenue rerouted Brighton Line trains to Downtown Brooklyn in 1920, the track connection to the BMT Franklin and Brighton Lines were severed. The connection to the now Franklin Avenue Shuttle was rebuilt in 1924 as a single-track station. The former westbound (now northbound) track was decked over with a wood platform to accommodate crowds transferring between the Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue Lines. The next stop to the east was Nostrand Avenue. The next stop to the west was Grand Avenue. When the BMT system was taken over by the City of New York on June 1, 1940, the Fulton Street Elevated Line was closed and later demolished as the IND Fulton Avenue Subway station built four years earlier was used as a replacement. The portion of the Fulton Street Elevated line beneath the Franklin Avenue shuttle platforms remained standing until the reconstruction project of 1998 and 1999. == References == == External links == NYC Subway.org: * * * nycsubway.org \u2014 Life and Continued Growth Artwork by Eric Pryor (1999) Station Reporter: * Station Reporter \u2014 C Train * Station Reporter \u2014 Franklin Shuttle * Station Reporter \u2014 Fulton Elevated Other: * The Subway Nut - Franklin Avenue Pictures * MTA's Arts For Transit \u2014 Franklin Avenue Google Maps Street View: * Franklin Avenue entrance to Manhattan bound Fulton Street Line * Franklin Avenue entrance to Rockaway bound Fulton Street Line and Shuttle * Overpass * BMT platform * IND platforms Category:BMT Franklin Avenue Shuttle stations Category:IND Fulton Street Line stations Category:New York City Subway transfer stations Category:BMT Fulton Street Line stations Category:Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway terminals Category:New York City Subway stations located aboveground Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1936 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1896 Category:1936 establishments in New York (state) ",
