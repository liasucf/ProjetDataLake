It stars Jefferson Moore, Matt Wallace (reprising his role as Tony Vincent from The Perfect Gift), and Juliana Allen as Nikki Cominsky (replacing Pamela Brumley who played Nikki in the first movie). == Plot == The third and final chapter in the 'Perfect Stranger' movie series, features the return of Nikki Cominskey, now in her forties and no longer a high-powered attorney, who has done everything she knows to grow spiritually, and wonders where her closeness with Jesus has gone. Burned out and hopeless, she wails her complaints to God during a late-night interstate trip. Running out of fuel, she finds Jesus once again....along the roadside with a can of gas. The Wonderful Counselor hops in and offers answers she never heard in a church and a nighttime of adventure ensues beyond anything Nikki could have ever imagined. == References == == External links == * * Category:Films about Evangelicalism Category:2013 films Category:Films shot in Kentucky Category:Films shot in Indiana Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:2010s drama films Category:Films based on American novels Category:2013 drama films ",
