    "text": "The Roswell Artist-in-Residence Compound, at 1404 W. Berrendo Rd. in Roswell, New Mexico, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. The Roswell Artist-in-Residence (RAiR) program used the listed compound until 2007, when the program was transferred to a new compound on the other side of Roswell. The program and compound was conceived, funded, and built by oilman and artist Donald B. Anderson. It was located on a farm whose old farmhouse served as a residence. Two barns were restored to serve as studio and wood shop. From 1967 to 1975 Anderson expanded the compound to include six houses and nine studios, arranged around two courtyards. According to the Roswell Daily Record: > The program provided significantly more generous grants than the handful of > artist-in-residence programs that existed nationwide in the late 1960s. From > 1967 to 1975, Anderson conceived of the idea of an artist-in-residence > program, constructed the compound of studios and residences and, with the > help of resident artists, developed and professionalized the RAiR Program. > Anderson funded the program, which provided five artists with a one-year > residency, a stipend for living expenses, and an unlimited stipend for > materials. Anderson welcomed artists\u2019 families and increased the living > stipend for each family member. The program provided artists with the \u201cgift > of time,\u201d a full year to focus on art without the distractions of everyday > life. More than 200 artists have been invited to Roswell through this > program and their stay here has enriched the lives of the Roswell community > and Roswell has enriched their lives as well. And > The Berrendo Road compound operated as the RAiR program from 1967 to 2007. > Throughout its 40-year history the grant at the historic site of the RAiR > program fostered the career of many artists who went on to achieve great > success and recognition in the art world. Luis Jimenez, Stuart Arends, Eddie > Dominguez, Robert Colescott, Diane Marsh, Milton Resnick, Bill Midgette, > David Reed, Wook-Kyung Choi, Michael Aakhus, Ted Kuykendall, Scott Green, > Pat Passlof, Phillis Ideal, Alison Saar, James McGarrell, Rachel Hayes and > Eric Sall are just a few of the notables who have been part of the \u201cgift of > time.\u201d Their works appear in public and private collections throughout the > nation and globally. The historic compound is located on the northwest outskirts of Roswell. The new compound, to which the RAIR program relocated in 2007, is east of the town. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chaves County, New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures in Chaves County, New Mexico ",
