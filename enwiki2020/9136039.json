Every time a customer purchased fuel at an Esso fuel station in Canada, they received a small packet of \"6 - Power Players Trader's Stickers\". These were then pasted into an album. Two albums were available, the standard (paperback) issue and a deluxe (hardcover) edition. The front cover of the softcover album read in French: \"NHL Les Grands Du Hockey Album\" and in English: \"NHL Power Player Saver\". == Overview == In the French edition, the first team listed was Montreal Canadiens; in the English version, the first team was Toronto Maple Leafs. An obvious attempt at regional marketing. Each team had space for 18 player cards, which were about half the size of a hockey card, cut horizontally. Hard cover sets retail for approximately $250, while soft cover sets are approximately $100. Along with the cards, collectors got a plastic wallet which folded in half and when opened, had four slots for storing cards. At some time later in the season, ESSO issued additional stickers for players traded during the season. At the end of the season, it was possible to write to Esso to order any cards one did not have. When one received the cards, they also came with 252 additional stickers to go below the cards in the album. These additional stickers showed the games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes for each player. ==References== Category:Ice hockey collectibles Category:Trading cards Category:ExxonMobil Category:Advertising campaigns Category:1970s in Canada Category:1970s in North American sport ",
