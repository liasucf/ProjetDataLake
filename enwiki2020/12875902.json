My inspiration is, on one side, my experiences in my studio, on the other, a succession of memories of the jungle in Putumayo. It is this constant trail of memory and dreams passing by in my mind when I am in front of that other window: the empty canvas.\"\u2013Carlos Jacanmijoy, 2007 ==Notes== ===References=== * Serrano, Eduardo.
