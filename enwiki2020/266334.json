    "text": "Paul Gustave Louis Christophe Dor\u00e9 (; ; 6 January 1832 \u2013 23 January 1883) was a French artist, printmaker, illustrator, comics artist, caricaturist, and sculptor who worked primarily with wood-engraving. ==Biography== Dor\u00e9 by Carolus-Duran (1877) Dor\u00e9 was born in Strasbourg on 6 January 1832. By age 5 he was a prodigy artist, creating drawings that were mature beyond his years. Seven years later, he began carving in stone. At the age of 15, Dor\u00e9 began his career working as a caricaturist for the French paper Le journal pour rire. Wood-engraving was his primary method at this time.\"Books: A Living History\" by Martin Lyons In the late 1840s and early 1850s, he made several text comics, like Les Travaux d'Hercule (1847), Trois artistes incompris et m\u00e9contents (1851), Les D\u00e9s-agr\u00e9ments d'un voyage d'agr\u00e9ment (1851) and L'Histoire de la Sainte Russie (1854). Dor\u00e9 subsequently went on to win commissions to depict scenes from books by Cervantes, Rabelais, Balzac, Milton, and Dante. He also illustrated \"Gargantua et Pantagruel\" in 1854. In 1853 Dor\u00e9 was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron.Complete Works of Lord Byron illustrated by Ch. Mettais, Bocourt, G. Dor\u00e9. Published by J. Bry, Paris, 1853. The version at archive.org is in French. The illustrations are not attributed to any one of the three named on the title-page. A handwritten note at page 5 remarks that another edition of 1856 made no mention of Dor\u00e9 among the illustrators, but his designs still appeared in the book. This commission was followed by additional work for British publishers, including a new illustrated Bible. In 1856 he produced 12 folio-size illustrations of The Legend of The Wandering Jew, which propagated longstanding antisemitic views of the time,Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, Oxford 2005, p 186 for a short poem which Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger had derived from a novel of Eug\u00e8ne Sue of 1845. In the 1860s he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's Don Quixote, and his depictions of the knight and his squire, Sancho Panza, have become so famous that they have influenced subsequent readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of the physical \"look\" of the two characters. Dor\u00e9 also illustrated an oversized edition of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\", an endeavor that earned him 30,000 francs from publisher Harper & Brothers in 1883.Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. p. 252. Dor\u00e9's illustrations for the Bible (1866) were a great success, and in 1867 Dor\u00e9 had a major exhibition of his work in London. This exhibition led to the foundation of the Dor\u00e9 Gallery in Bond Street, London.McQueen, A. \"Gustave Dor\u00e9,\" in Nineteenth-Century Art, Highlights from the Tanenbaum Collection, London: 2015, p. 54. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold, the son of Douglas William Jerrold, suggested that they work together to produce a comprehensive portrait of London. Jerrold had obtained the idea from The Microcosm of London produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson (published in three volumes from 1808 to 1810). Dor\u00e9 signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant & Co that involved his staying in London for three months a year, and he received the vast sum of \u00a310,000 a year for the project. Dor\u00e9 was mainly celebrated for his paintings in his day. His paintings remain world-renowned, but his woodcuts and engravings, like those he did for Jerrold, are where he excelled as an artist with an individual vision. The completed book London: A Pilgrimage, with 180 wood-engravings, was published in 1872. It enjoyed commercial and popular success, but the work was disliked by many contemporary critics. Some of these critics were concerned by the fact that Dor\u00e9 appeared to focus on the poverty that existed in parts of London. Dor\u00e9 was accused by The Art Journal of \"inventing rather than copying\". The Westminster Review claimed that \"Dor\u00e9 gives us sketches in which the commonest, the vulgarest external features are set down\". The book was a financial success, however, and Dor\u00e9 received commissions from other British publishers. Dor\u00e9's later work included illustrations for new editions of Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Milton's Paradise Lost, Tennyson's Idylls of the King, The Works of Thomas Hood, and The Divine Comedy. Dor\u00e9's work also appeared in the weekly newspaper The Illustrated London News. Dor\u00e9 never married and, following the death of his father in 1849, he continued to live with his mother, illustrating books until his death in Paris following a short illness. The city's P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery contains his grave. At the time of his death in 1883, he was working on illustrations for an edition of Shakespeare's plays. The government of France made him a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1861. ==Works== Dor\u00e9 was a prolific artist; thus the following list of works is not complete and it does not include his paintings, sculptures, and many of his journal illustrations: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Date!!Author!!Work!!Volumes / Format!!Illustrations!!Publisher!!Ref |- |1854|| Gustave Dor\u00e9 ||Histoire pittoresque dramatique et caricaturale de la Sainte Russie, d'apr\u00e8s les chroniqueurs et historiens Nestor Nikan Sylvestre Karamsin S\u00e9gur etc. ||1 vol.||500|| Paris: de Bry ||indyworld.com Gustave Dor\u00e9's \u00abHoly Russia\u00bb by Bill Kartalopoulos.

For one, she places this reference with the other books published in 1865, for another, she uses the word also when mentioning that Sampson Low brought out a copy in London in 1866. Additionally, an English publication would most likely be translated and have a title of Toilers of the Sea.
