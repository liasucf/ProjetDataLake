    "text": "Clearing the Eye is the first DVD release by the Los Angeles post-metal band Isis. It features live videos (including an entire live performance), the \"In Fiction\" music video, photo galleries, lyrics for all songs featured, a complete discography, and a 20-page booklet. The DVD was originally to include a full documentary of the band, but was removed just prior to its release. According to the DVD's documentarian Seldon Hunt, \"[t]he ISIS documentary was shelved at the last minute due to deadlines with Ipecac and some sound quality issues where there was not enough time to resolve before the release came out.\" This recording, as of 2015, has gone missing. ==Track list== All songs written and performed by Isis. ===The Troubadour in Los Angeles on November 5, 2005=== # \"Glisten\" \u2013 6:39 # \"Weight\" \u2013 12:53 ===CBGB in New York on August 26, 2001=== # \"Celestial\" \u2013 10:38 # \"Collapse and Crush\" \u2013 6:24 ===Club Quattro in Tokyo, Japan on February 5, 2005=== # \"Grinning Mouths\" \u2013 9:18 ===CBGB in New York on June 3, 2001=== # \"CFT\" \u2013 7:23 # \"Gentle Time\" \u2013 7:26 ===Annandale Hotel in Sydney, Australia on February 11, 2005=== # \"Intro\" \u2013 0:49 # \"So Did We\" \u2013 8:38 # \"Backlit\" \u2013 10:20 # \"The Beginning and the End\" \u2013 8:42 # \"In Fiction\" \u2013 10:32 # \"Wills Dissolve\" \u2013 7:32 # \"Grinning Mouths\" \u2013 9:49 # \"Altered Course\" \u2013 16:19 # \"From Sinking\" \u2013 9:02 ===Music video=== # \"In Fiction\" \u2013 5:37 ==Reception== Dave Kerr of The Skinny described it as a \u201cno-frills package without any great technical jiggery pokery,\u201d and that \u201cas a visual spectacle (the bonus promo video for In Fiction notwithstanding) there's little of note going on but a band throwing down onstage. For all the great music on show, the package still smacks of their having been a mate with a camcorder on the tour bus.\u201d ==Personnel== * Jeff Caxide \u2013 bass guitar * Aaron Harris \u2013 drums * Michael Gallagher \u2013 guitar * Bryant Clifford Meyer \u2013 electronics, guitar * Aaron Turner \u2013 vocals, guitar * Justin Chancellor \u2013 additional sounds/bass guitar on \"Weight\" * Troy Zeigler \u2013 additional percussion on \"Weight\" * Greg Moss \u2013 live sound * Jason Hellman \u2013 website design ==References== ==External links== *Stonerrock.com release information Category:Isis (band) video albums Category:2006 video albums Category:Live video albums Category:2006 live albums Category:Ipecac Recordings live albums Category:Ipecac Recordings video albums ",
