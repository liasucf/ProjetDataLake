Dr. Cook is also chief medical advisor to HeartCloud.io. Cook's work has largely focused on the care of mental disorders and disorders of complex human behavior. He is a co-inventor of the cordance method for studying regional brain activity with electroencephalograms. Research by Cook and his colleagues has shown that past use of antidepressants can influence the brain's reaction to antidepressant placebos, that standard advice on diet and exercise for heart health can also lead to better brain health, that different types of advertisement evoke different types of brain activity, that electroencephalogram measurements could predict the outcome of antidepressant drug treatment on an individual patient long before the drugs make any observable changes to the patient's moods, and that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve can be an effective alternative to drug therapy for depression. ==Fellowships== *2009 - Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association ==References== ==External links== * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American psychiatrists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Yale School of Medicine alumni Category:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA faculty ",
