Ysgol Clywedog is located in the south-west suburbs of Wrexham. The school takes its name from the nearby River Clywedog. The school's name was chosen by the public in a competition which the governors of the school judged. ==History== In 2001, Wrexham County Borough Council decided to reorganise the secondary schools of Wrexham to solve the problem of surplus places and to update ageing infrastructure by merging the three town schools. The Groves High School, St Davids High School and Ysgol Bryn Offa were closed in July 2003. This was opposed by several staff, parents and pupils of all three schools, and a petition bearing more than 1000 names was made during 2002.BBC Superschools The Welsh Assembly Government reinforced the local councils decision. In 2003 two new schools were established on the sites of St.Davids and Bryn Offa. In the same year work began on the new schools. The Groves site was used to house Rhosnesni High School in 2003/04 and Ysgol Clywedog in 2004/05 BBC Both Ysgol Clywedog and Rhosnesni High School were dubbed \"super\" schools by the media and the local council and were designed to cater for 1200 pupils each. ==Performance== In March 2013 it was announced that the school had been put into special measures due to poor performance.Performance The Estyn (the equivalent of Ofsted in England)January 2013 report, said that the school was 'Unsatisfactory' in several areas, the worst of the four judgement grades that could be usedhttp://www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6654049/ By March 2015 the school was removed from special measures following significant improvements in exam results and the quality of teaching.Monitoring Report.pdf The school achieved record exam results in 2014 and 2015.
