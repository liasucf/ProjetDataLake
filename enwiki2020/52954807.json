The band has never performed live or given any official interviews.band_id=2757&bandname;=Silencer Silencer biography Retrieved January 23, 2017 == History == === Early years === Silencer was formed in 1995 as a solo project of guitarist/bassist Andreas Casado, under the pseudonym Leere. At some point prior to 1998, Nattramn was enlisted as the band's vocalist and lyricist. In late 1998, with the help of session drummer Jonas Mattsson, Silencer released their first professional demo, which was composed of a single, eleven minute song titled \"Death - Pierce Me\". === Death - Pierce Me === In July 2000, Silencer began recording their album Death - Pierce Me (2001), which was released by Prophecy Productions. Recording sessions included a total of three members performing on the album, which included Steve Wolz (Bethlehem and Imperia) playing drums. The song \"Sterile Nails and Thunderbowels\" had a promotional video released for it, which contains images from the 1990 experimental horror film, Begotten by E. Elias Merhige.Videos musicales que perturban (spanish) Retrieved January 22, 2017 === Breakup and subsequent projects === Following the release of Death - Pierce Me, it is speculated that Nattramn was institutionalised at Sankt Sigfrids sjukhus (English: \"Saint Sigfrid's Hospital\"), a mental hospital located in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, although there is no conclusive evidence to support this. In 2007, he released a dark ambient solo album called 'Transformalin', under the project name Diagnose: Lebensgefahr (roughly translated from German as \"Diagnosis - mortal danger\"). Nattramn released a book, Grishj\u00e4rta (meaning \"pig's heart\" in Swedish) in 2011, a limited edition work containing his artwork and poetry, and a small selection of new photographs of him - albeit with his face obscured. These, and his promotional photographs from his time in Silencer, in which his face is also obscured, are the only publicly available photographs of Nattramn. The other member, guitarist/bassist/songwriter Andreas \"Leere\" Casado, went on to join Shining between 2005 and 2006, under the mononym \"Casado\". He contributed lyrics to the song \"Eradication of the Condition\" from the album IV - The Eerie Cold. In 2006, he worked with the band Zavorash, as composer of the song \"Worthlessness\" from the album Nihilistic Ascension & Spiritual Death as Andreas Casado. == Discography == * Death - Pierce Me (demo, 1998) * Death - Pierce Me (full-length album, 2001) == Members == === Official lineup === * Nattramn (1995-2001): vocals * Andreas Casado (1995-2001): guitars, bass === Session musicians === * Jonas Mattsson \u2013 drums (demo, 1998) * Steve Wolz \u2013 drums (studio album, 2001) === Chronology === == References == == External links == * Category:Swedish black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2001 Category:Musical groups from Stockholm Category:Heavy metal duos ",
