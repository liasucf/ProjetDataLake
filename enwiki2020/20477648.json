    "text": "The South Plateau languages, also known as Jilic\u2013Eggonic, are spoken in central Nigeria. Eggon has 150,000 speakers and Jili (Lijili, Mijili) perhaps 100,000. ==Classification== Jilic (Koro) and Eggonic are clearly valid groups. Their connection was proposed in Blench (2006, 2008). Two languages or dialects, Koro-Ija and Koro-Zuba (collectively known as Ija-Zuba), are said to be \"nearly intelligible\" with Jijili, but no language data exists.Blench (2008) Prospecting proto-Plateau.
