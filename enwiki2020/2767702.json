They were accorded the status of prisoners of war. Among the prisoners were the future Hollywood actor Arthur Shields and sportsman and referee Thomas Burke. It is a common misconception that \u00c9amon de Valera was also imprisoned at Frongoch.During this time de Valera was held at Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons. The camp became a fertile seeding ground for spreading the ideology of the Irish rebels, with inspired organisers such as Michael Collins giving impromptu lessons in guerrilla tactics. Later the camp became known as ollscoil na r\u00e9abhl\u00f3ide, the \"University of Revolution\". Lord Decies was appointed as Chief Press Censor for Ireland after the Rising in 1916, and he warned the press to be careful about what they published. William O'Brien's Cork Free Press was one of the first papers he suppressed under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 (DORA regulations) after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners at the camp.Peter Martin Censorship in the two Irelands 1922-39, Introduction p.9, Irish Academic Press (2008) The camp was emptied in December 1916 when David Lloyd George replaced H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister. The local school Ysgol Bro Tryweryn now stands on the site of the former camp but a commemorative plaque stands nearby, with inscriptions in Irish, Welsh and English. In 2016, the hundredth anniversary of the internment of Irish prisoners at Frongoch, the local community organized a number of commemoration events and the history of the camp was widely reported. ==List of Internees involved in the Easter Rising== This list is not complete.
