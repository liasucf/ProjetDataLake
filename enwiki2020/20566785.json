    "text": "Tetrabrachium ocellatum (four-armed frogfish) is a species of anglerfish, closely related to the true frogfishes. It is the only member of its genus. Like the true frogfishes, it is a small fish, no more than in length, with a flattened body and loose skin. It has prehensile pectoral fins, helping it to move along the seabed, and giving it its \"four-armed\" appearance. It lives in shallow waters, around depth, off the coasts of New Guinea, Indonesia, and Australia. ==References== Category:Lophiiformes Category:Monotypic marine fish genera Category:Taxa named by Albert G\u00fcnther ",
