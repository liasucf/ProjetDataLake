    "text": "Nickel(II) bromide is the name for the inorganic compounds with the chemical formula NiBr2(H2O)x. The value of x can be 0 for the anhydrous material, as well as 2, 3, or 6 for the three known hydrate forms. The anhydrous material is a yellow-brown solid which dissolves in water to give blue-green hexahydrate (see picture). == Structure == The structure of the nickel bromides varies with the degree of hydration. In all of these cases, the nickel(II) ion adopts an octahedral molecular geometry. *Anhydrous NiBr2 adopts the cadmium chloride structure. The interatomic distance for Ni-Br is 2.52\u20142.58 \u00c5. *The structure of the trihydrate has not been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. It is assumed to adopt a chain structure.DeFotis, G. C.; Goodey, J. R.; Narducci, A. A.; Welch, M. H. \"NiBr2\u00b73H2O, a lower dimensional antiferromagnet\" Journal of Applied Physics (1996), 79(8, Pt. 2A), 4718-4720. *The di- and hexahydrates adopt structures akin to those for the corresponding chlorides. The dihydrate consists of a linear chain, whereas the hexahydrate features isolated trans-[NiBr2(H2O)4] molecules together with two noncoordinated water molecules. == Reactions and uses == NiBr2 has Lewis acid character. NiBr2 is also used to prepare catalysts for cross-coupling reactions and various carbonylations. Empirically, NiBr2-glyme has shown increased activity compared to that of NiCl2-glyme for some transformations. NiBr2-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. == Safety == Nickel(II) is toxic and suspected to be a cancer agent. == References == Category:Nickel compounds Category:Bromides Category:Metal halides ",
