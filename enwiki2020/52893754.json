This date was the first recording by American saxophonist Glenn Spearman, who moved to Paris in 1972 and co-founded this international quintet with bassist Bob Reid along with French guitarist Boulou Ferre and two Japanese musicians: pianist Takashi Kako and drummer Sabu Toyozumi.Glenn Spearman discography by Rick Lopez ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states \"A true, fiery blowout of honk and skronk, Spearman observes the dictums of his teacher Frank Wright, and attempts to turn his horn inside out. This is a must for anyone who is interested in the development of free jazz in the 1970s.\" ==Track listing== # \"Emergency Theme\" (Gency) \u2013 15:22 # \"People in Sorrow\" (Roscoe Mitchell) \u2013 7:57 # \"Kako Tune\" (Takashi Kako) \u2013 11:32 # \"Infidels\" (Bob Reid) \u2013 9:34 ==Personnel== *Glenn Spearman \u2013 tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone *Takashi Kako \u2013piano *Boulou Ferr\u00e9 \u2013 electric guitar *Bob Reid \u2013 bass *Sabu Toyozumi \u2013 drums ==References== Category:1973 live albums Category:Glenn Spearman live albums Category:America Records live albums ",
