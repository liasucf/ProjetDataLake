    "text": "The 2019 San Jose State Spartans football team represented San Jose State University in the 2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Spartans were led by third year coach Brent Brennan and played their home games at CEFCU Stadium. San Jose State was a member of the Mountain West Conference in the West Division. They finished the season 5\u20137, 2\u20136 in Mountain West play to finish in a three-way tie for fourth place in the West Division. On June 5, 2019, San Jose State broke ground on its new Football Operations Building. The first phase of the project involved replacing the bleachers on the east side of the stadium with grass, which reduced the seating capacity by 8,936. It will be demolished and rebuilt along with the new Football Operations Building by 2023. On September 21, 2019, San Jose State beat Arkansas for their first win over a Power 5 opponent since 2006. This was also San Jose State's first ever win over an opponent from the Southeastern Conference. ==Previous season== The Team finished in last place in the West Division with a 1\u201311 record and a conference record of 1\u20137 in Mountain West play for the second straight year. ==Recruiting== ===Position Key=== ===Recruits=== ==Preseason== ===Mountain West media days=== The Mountain West media days were held from July 23\u201324, 2019 at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson, NV. ====Media poll==== The preseason poll was released at the Mountain West media days on July 23, 2019.
