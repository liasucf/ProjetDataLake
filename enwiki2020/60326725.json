    "text": "The Quincunx Cycle is a series of novels written by Trinidadian-Canadian author Andr\u00e9 Alexis. Each novel is based on one of the themes of faith, place, love, power and hatred and all take place in and around Southern Ontario with Fifteen Dogs and The Hidden Keys both set in Toronto. Alexis began the series in 2014 with Pastoral. The second novel in the series, Fifteen Dogs, was the recipient of the 2015 Giller Prize. Alexis conceived of the project as a response to Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1968 film Teorema. Alexis completed Pastoral, the first novel in the cycle, in 2009 but was unable to find a publisher for years. In 2019, while promoting Days by Moonlight Alexis suggested that when the final novel in the cycle was published he would re- edit the entire series for cohesion. ==Novels== ===Pastoral=== Quincunx 1 Pastoral was published in 2014 and examines faith. ===Fifteen Dogs=== Quincunx 2, Fifteen Dogs, deals with the theme of place. The novel was nominated for, and won, two of the highest prizes available to literature in Canada: the 2015 Scotiabank Giller Prize and the 2015 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize. ===Ring=== While labelled the third in the series, Quincunx 3 will be the last in order of publication. While promoting Days by Moonlight Alexis revealed that the final novel would be called Ring and also suggested that, while characters from each series have cameos in other books, Ring would more clearly link the works together. ===The Hidden Keys=== Quincunx 4, was published in 2016. The novel dealt with the theme of power. ===Days by Moonlight=== Quincunx 5 was published in 2019, the furthest gap between novels in the Quincunx thus far. == References == Category:Book series introduced in 2014 Category:Novels by Andr\u00e9 Alexis Category:Novel series Category:Novel sequences ",
