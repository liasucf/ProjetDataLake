    "text": "Oblique Lunar Orbiter 5 image with Lents at center and Lents C below right, facing west Lents is a small lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It is located within the north-northwestern section of the immense skirt of ejecta that surrounds the Mare Orientale impact basin. To the south is the Montes Cordillera mountain ring, and to the north-northeast is the damaged crater Elvey. This is a bowl-shaped formation with an interior floor that is about half the diameter of the crater. Attached to the northeastern exterior of Lents is the satellite crater Lents C, a feature of roughly the same dimension. Slightly more than a crater diameter to the east of Lents C is Pierazzo, which produced a broad, wispy ray system that extends for more than 100 km in all directions. The ray material from this impact lies across both Lents C and Lents, reaching as far north as Elvey. On some maps, Lents is called Lenz. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lents. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Lents !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|C |align=\"center\"|3.3\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|101.6\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|23 km |- |align=\"center\"|J |align=\"center\"|3.7\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|97.3\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|16 km |- |align=\"center\"|K |align=\"center\"|2.3\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|98.8\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|21 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
