Nes, September\u2013October 1977, The Link, Volume 10, Issue 4, Page 2. Link Carter elaborated on this new approach in another interview with her that startled the Arabs. It was a generous face-saving offer to Begin by Carter, giving Israel the opportunity to accept the notions of withdrawal from the West Bank and of participation by the Palestinians in a gradual, limited process of self-determination.Worldview, \"The U.S. and Israel: In the Eye of the Storm\", Mark A.
