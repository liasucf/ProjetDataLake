    "text": "The Engelbert\u2013Schmidt zero\u2013one law is a theorem that gives a mathematical criterion for an event associated with a continuous, non-decreasing additive functional of Brownian motion to have probability either 0 or 1, without the possibility of an intermediate value. This zero-one law is used in the study of questions of finiteness and asymptotic behavior for stochastic differential equations. (A Wiener process is a mathematical formalization of Brownian motion used in the statement of the theorem.) This 0-1 law, published in 1981, is named after Hans-J\u00fcrgen Engelbert and the probabilist Wolfgang Schmidt (not to be confused with the number theorist Wolfgang M. Schmidt). ==Engelbert\u2013Schmidt 0\u20131 law== Let \\mathcal{F} be a \u03c3-algebra and let F = (\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0} be an increasing family of sub-\u03c3-algebras of \\mathcal{F}. Let (W, F) be a Wiener process on the probability space (\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P). Suppose that f is a Borel measurable function of the real line into [0,\u221e]. Then the following three assertions are equivalent: (i) P \\left( \\int_0^t f (W_s)\\,ds < \\infty, \\text{ for all } t \\ge 0 \\right) > 0 (ii) P \\left( \\int_0^t f (W_s)\\,ds < \\infty \\text{ for all } t \\ge 0 \\right) = 1 (iii) \\int_K f (y)\\,dy < \\infty \\, for all compact subsets K of the real line. ==See also== *zero-one law ==References== Category:Probability theorems ",
