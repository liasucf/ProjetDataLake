    "text": "An illustration of an early magic lantern from the Collegium Experimentale sive Curiosum (1676) The Collegium Curiosum or Collegium Experimentale was a twenty-member scientific society founded by Johann Sturm, a professor at the University of Altdorf, in 1672. It was based on the model of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento. Sturm published two volumes of the academy's proceedings in Nuremberg, under the title Collegium Experimentale sive Curiosum (1676 and 1685). It was as much a private club as a formal academy,Neil Kenny, The Uses of Curiosity in Early Modern France and Germany (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 184. and a lot of the time seems to have been spent with Sturm demonstrating experiments to the other members. ==Proceedings== * Volume 1 (1676), available online from Wolfenb\u00fctteler Digitale Bibliothek and on Google Books * Volume 2 (1685) available online from S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2014 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden (SLUB) and on Google Books ==References== Category:1672 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Scientific societies based in Germany ",
