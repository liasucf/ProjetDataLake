    "text": "Clithon spinosum is a species of brackish water and freshwater snail with an operculum, a nerite. It is an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Neritidae, the nerites. == Distribution == Distribution of Clithon spinosum include Indo-Pacific and it ranges from New Guinea and south-eastern Asia and eastern Asia to Marquesas. It also occurs in Japan, New Georgia,Haynes A. (1990). \"The numbers of freshwater gastropods on Pacific islands and the theory of island biogeography\". Malacologia 31: 237-248. Fiji and Tahiti and in French Polynesia including the following Society Islands: Tahiti, Mo'orea, Raiatea, Huahine.Myers M. J., Meyer C. P. & Resh V. H.

Freshwater Biology 44(3): 535\u2013545. . ==Description== There are always spines on its shell.Haynes A. (1988). \"Notes on the stream neritids (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) of Oceania\". Micronesica 21: 93\u2013102. PDF. Spines are long and thin and they are directed rearward. The width of the shell is 15\u201320 mm.Tryon G. W. (1888\u20131889) Manual of Conchology, structural and systematic, with illustrations of the species. Volume 10, 322 pp., 69 plates. page 63, plate 23, figure 6\u20137. ==Ecology== Clithon spinosum is a dioecious (it has two separate sexes) and amphidromous snail. Adults live in freshwater and larvae are marine. Larvae are long-lived planktotrophs. Adults prefer boulders and cobbles over granules as a substrate.Blanco J. F. & Scatena F. N.

They were found mainly on bottom of rocks in aquaria and in situ. They are reported from altitude 0\u201310 m a.s.l..Liu H. T. T. & Resh V. H.

They can reach densities up to 57.0 \u00b1 17.3 snails per square meter of a stream. Adults can survive 8 hours in seawater (longer exposure was not tested). It is not used as food source by humans. ==References== == External links == Category:Neritidae Category:Gastropods described in 1825 Category:Taxa named by George Brettingham Sowerby I ",
