    "text": "David Arthur Russell Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford, (born 18 January 1936) is a British Conservative politician, journalist, and economic consultant. Having been successively Secretary of State for Energy and then for Transport under Margaret Thatcher, Howell has more recently been a Minister of State in the Foreign Office from the election in 2010 until the reshuffle of 2012. He has served as Chair of the House of Lords International Relations Committee since May 2016. Along with William Hague, Sir George Young and Kenneth Clarke, he is one of the few Cabinet ministers from the 1979\u201397 governments who continued to hold high office in the party, being its deputy leader in the House of Lords until 2010. His daughter, Frances, was married to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. ==Family== Howell is the son of Colonel Arthur Howard Eckford Howell, and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Alfred Russell Howell, and his wife (married 9 April 1931) Beryl Stuart Bowater, daughter of Sir Frank Henry Bowater, 1st Baronet and Ethel Anita Fryar. Howell's father, an army officer with the Royal Artillery, for many years lived at 5 Headfort Place, London. He was decorated with the awards of the Territorial Decoration (TD) and Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO and bar). ==Early life== Howell was educated at Eton College, before entering King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1959 with a 1st Class Master of Arts in Economics. He went to work in HM Treasury joining the Treasury Economic Section from 1959 to 1960. In 1960 he wrote the book Principles to Practice, published jointly, and spent four years as a journalist, leader writer and special correspondent on The Daily Telegraph. He succeeded Geoffrey Howe as editor of Crossbow (the journal of the Bow Group) from 1962 to 1964 before he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Dudley in the 1964 general election. He then became Director of the Conservative Political Centre between 1964 and 1966 writing and publishing the pamphlet The Conservative Opportunity. ==Political career== Two years later, in 1966, he was elected MP for the safe seat of Guildford in Surrey, for the Conservative Party, a seat he held until retiring at the 1997 general election. On 6 June 1997 he was made a life peer as Baron Howell of Guildford, of Penton Mewsey, in the County of Hampshire. Howell, a junior minister in the Edward Heath Government (1970\u201374), served as Lord Commissioner of Treasury between 1970 and 1971 and Parliamentary Secretary for the Civil Service Department between 1970 and 1972, and played a key role in the establishment of the Central Policy Review Staff, a \"central capability\" policy unit based in the Cabinet Office. He also held the offices of Under-Secretary for Employment (1971\u201372), Under-Secretary for Northern Ireland (1972), Minister of State for Northern Ireland (1972\u201374) and Minister of State for Energy (1974). When Margaret Thatcher was elected in 1979, she made Howell her first Secretary of State for Energy and then moved him to Transport in the reshuffle of September 1981 and until 1983. His time at the Ministry of Transport saw the commissioning and publication of the highly controversial Serpell Report into Britain's Railways. The report which emerged included proposals which would have greatly reduced the rail network in Britain and met with an extremely hostile reaction. Although these proposals were not pursued the episode caused considerable political problems for the Government and contributed to Thatcher dropping Howell from the Cabinet. He wrote the book Freedom and Capital, published 1981. In 1979 he was also sworn into the Privy Council. He then wrote the book Blind Victory: a study in income, wealth and power, published 1986. In 1987 he became chairman of the Select committee on Foreign Affairs. He later wrote the book The Edge of Now: new questions for democracy in the network age, published in 2000. In 2007 he published \u2018Out of the Energy Labyrinth\u2019 (with Carole Nakhle) and in 2013 \u2018Old Links and New Ties: Power and Persuasion in the Age of Networks\u2019,mainly on the Commonwealth. In 2016 he published \u2018Empires in Collision; the green versus black struggle for our energy future\u2019. From 2005 to 2014 he was President \u2018of the British Institute of Energy Economics, and chairman of the Windsor Energy Group since 2003. He was decorated with the award of Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan in 2001. In the House of Lords, he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 2005 to 2010. On the election of the Coalition government he was quickly recommended to Foreign Secretary by the Prime Minister as an enthusiastic advocate of HS2, the only conservative in the government with the relevant ministerial experience. In September 2012 In the September 2012 reshuffle, having served two years as initially agreed, he was asked by the Prime Minister to stand down to provide a Foreign Office place for Baroness Warsi. \u2018 Lord Howell was Opposition Spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2000 to 2010. He is now Chairman of the new House of Lords International relations Committee\u2019. Lord Howell is also Chairman of The Commonwealth Societies Association.http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-howell-of- guildford/993 Retrieved 2 November 2015 Howell has long been an active supporter of the Commonwealth lobbying its many members from the business council, secretariat, and Eminent Persons Group. The Commonwealth with strong connections to Africa and African nations economic groups seeks to promote Britain's role as a friend and trading partner of countries across the region, and to alleviate poverty-stricken areas. On 29 September 2011 Lord Howell chaired and important meeting of the Eminent Persons Group at the Royal Commonwealth Institute in London with Heads of Government and State being present. Britain took an active part in coming to the rescue in responding to Darfur Crisis in which thousands were victims in the desert civil war of pestilence, famine and destitution.http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/africa/horn-of- africa/sudan/b110-the-chaos-in-darfur.aspx Lord Howell has been a powerful advocate for the lawless nation of Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth when he declared he \"was living for the day\" he revealed the deep undercurrents of feelings within the UK which 'will actively support human rights defenders when fighting for their rights in Commonwealth countries'. He has likewise encouraged the application of the new State of South Sudan to join the Commonwealth of Nations when they are fit for purpose. From the election of May 2010 until the reshuffle of 2012, Lord Howell served as Minister of State in the Foreign Office in David Cameron's government, under William Hague as Foreign Secretary. From September 2012 to April 2013, he was personal adviser to the Foreign Secretary on Energy and Resource Security. Lord Howell has never lobbied on behalf of the IAEA or performed any role related to it at any time. He had nothing to do with the State Visit of the Chinese Chairman or with the deal to build a nuclear power station. He has, however, described the French/Chinese nuclear Hinkley Point C deal as \u2018one of the worst deals ever for the British consumer\u2019.(FDI).https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34601823 dated 23 October 2015. Retrieved on 3 November 2015. In November 2012, Greenpeace released secret film of an interview with Lord Howell about the advantages of natural gas over wind power, in which he said that David Cameron \"is not familiar with these issues, doesn't understand them\", but that George Osborne, his son-in-law, \"is of course getting this message and is putting pressure on\". In May 2013, he was appointed president of the Energy Industries Council.http://www.worldoil.com/Lord_Howell_of_Guildford_appointed_president_of_the_EIC.html Retrieved 3 November 2015 In July 2013, he said, in a Lords' discussion on fracking, \"there are large, uninhabited and desolate areas, certainly in parts of the north-east, where there is plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody's residence, and where it could be conducted without any threat to the rural environment\". After much adverse reaction, he apologised, said he been totally misunderstood, had never said the north was \u2018desolate\u2019 as misreported by some papers and that he was thinking of drilling preferably in areas left derelict by the Industrial Revolution in both the north east and north west which needed repair and new investment. He went on to say he wanted the derricks in \"unloved places\". ==Marriage and issue== Lord Howell married in 1967 Cary Davina Wallace, daughter of David John Wallace (born 1914, killed in action, World War II, Greece, 1944, son of Euan Wallace by first wife Idina Sackville) and wife (m. 1939) Joan Prudence Magor (who later remarried on 3 March 1948 Gerald Frederick Walter de Winton), and had three children: * Hon. Frances Victoria Howell (b. 18 February 1969), a writer, former wife of George Osborne * Hon. Katherine \"Kate\" Davina Howell (born 6 October 1970), wife of Paul Bain, by whom she had Jack-Daniel Maconald (b. 22 June 1992) and Oliver Bartholomew (b. 20 September 1995) * Hon. \"Toby\" David Howell (born 1975), married for six years to Isabel Usera de Moreno with two children, Tristan David, born 2011 and Grace Isabel, born 2014. == Ministerial career == {| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" |+Table to show Ministerial posts held !scope=\"col\"style=\"width:300px\"|Post !scope=\"col\"style=\"width:100px\"|Date |- | Minister of State (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) (International Energy Policy) ||May 2010Sep 2012 |- |Shadow Deputy Leader of the House of Lords||Jun 2005May 2010 |- |Shadow Minister (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs) ||Jul 2000May 2010 |- |Secretary of State for Transport |Sep 1981Jun 1983 |- |Secretary of State for Energy ||May 1979Sep 1981 |- |Shadow Minister (Business, Innovation and Skills) ||Jul 1977May 1979 |- |Minister of State (Department of Energy) ||Jan 1974Mar 1974 |- |Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Northern Ireland Office)||Mar 1972Nov 1972 |- |Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Department of Employment)||Jan 1971Mar 1972 |- |Lord Commissioner (HM Treasury) (Whip) ||Jun 1970Jan 1971 |- |Parliamentary Secretary (Civil Service Department)||Jun 1970Mar 1972http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord- howell-of-guildford/993 Retrieved on 3 November 2015 |} {| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" |+Table to show Select Committee membership !scope=\"col\"style=\"width:300px\"|Committee !scope=\"col\"style=\"width:50px\"|House !scope=\"col\"style=\"width:100px\"|Date |- |Soft Power Committee ||Lords || May 2013Mar 2014 |- |Procedure Committee (L) ||Lords||Jun 2005Nov 2006 |- | EU Sub-Committee C ||Lords||Dec 1999Nov 2000 |- |European Union Committee (L) ||Lords||Dec 1998Nov 2000 |- |EU Sub-Committee B ||Lords||Nov 1998Nov 1999 |- |Liaison Committee (Commons) ||Commons||Jun 1987Mar 1997 |- |Foreign Affairs Committee ||Commons||Feb 1986Mar 1997 |} ==References== == Bibliography == * Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, pages 51 and 456. * Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 107th edition, volume 2, page 1989. * * * * ==External links== * * |- |- Category:1936 births Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:British Secretaries of State Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Living people Category:Members of the Bow Group Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Secretaries of State for Transport (UK) Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:Politics of Guildford Category:Northern Ireland Office junior ministers Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Guildford ",
