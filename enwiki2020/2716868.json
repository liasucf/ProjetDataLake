Simeus returned to Haiti to be a candidate in the 2006 presidential elections. ==Early life== Sim\u00e9us was born in Pont-Sond\u00e9 in Haiti's Artibonite Valley, the son of peasant rice farmers who never had a chance to get a school education. He grew up helping his parents work the land in Haiti to feed himself and his 11 siblings. In 1961, his family sold some land so he could fly to the United States to pursue a college education at Florida A&M; University. Sim\u00e9us transferred to Howard University in Washington, DC, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering. In 1970, he became a US citizen.\"Would-be candidate fights for chance to change Haiti\", Boston Globe, October 19, 2005 In 1972, he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.University of Chicago Business School ==Career== He worked his way up the corporate ladder. He was a financial analyst at Rockwell International and KB Home, a director of Latin American operations for Bendix, general manager of Hartz Pet Food, France, and vice president of international business development at Atari.\"Profits (and perils) abroad\" ANTIC Vol. 2, No. 12, March 1984, p14 He quickly rose in the corporate world, becoming president of Beatrice Foods, Latin America, and eventually president and chief operating officer of TLC Beatrice International Foods. In 1984, Sim\u00e9us started working for TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., the $2.1 billion, black-owned food processing and distribution company. He served as president and CEO for two years before leaving in 1992 to buy and run his own business. In 1996, with $55 million financing, Sim\u00e9us bought Portion-Trol Foods from Flagstar Corp in Mansfield, Texas, and renamed it Sim\u00e9us Foods International Inc. Sim\u00e9us Foods, based south of Fort Worth, manufactures value-added food products for national multichain restaurants and large institutions such as El Pollo Loco, Denny's, T.G.I. Friday's, and Burger King in the United States and Canada. Sim\u00e9us Foods Intl. now generates $155 million a year. In 1999, Sim\u00e9us established Org. Sov\u00e9 Lavi www.sovelavi.org, a nonprofit foundation to provide medical care, education, and clothing to Haitians. Between October 2004 and February 2005, he served on Florida Governor Jeb Bush's advisory board for Haiti. The group made a series of recommendations for Ha\u00efti's security, economic development, and disaster preparedness. A group of about 40 U.S.-based Haitian business and civic leaders has urged him to run for president. ==Run for Haitian presidency== After months of speculation, Sim\u00e9us decided to contest the Haitian presidency in August 2005.\"Businessman returns to Haiti to run for president\", USA Today, 17 August 2005 Sim\u00e9us' political platform includes making it easier for companies to invest in Haiti, promoting jobs, and rooting out corruption by making government accountable. Sim\u00e9us said, \"I want to create a Haiti where people are proud to stay because there are opportunities.\" ...\"I want a Haiti where there is access to capital for the average guy, for the poor guy who was born in a hut like I was born in.\" During his campaign, he ran into a few challenges. His status as a dual citizen became a challenge. Sim\u00e9us said that he still has Haitian citizenship, despite taking the US oath of allegiance. The Haitian Electoral Board disagreed. Eventually, this matter was taken to the Supreme Court of Haiti, which recently ruled that Sim\u00e9us could place his name on the ballot, but he still faces election council challenges to his candidacy and a threat of prosecution alleging false candidacy claims on election papers. Article 135 states a presidential candidate must \"be a native-born Haitian and never have renounced Haitian nationality\" and have resided in the country for five consecutive years before the election. Another challenge is his public acceptance. Sim\u00e9us was essentially unknown in Haiti prior to 2004 and many viewed him as an outsider. At a campaign rally, he was cordially received in Solino, a crumbling and crime-plagued neighborhood of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, but when his tour reached the Bel Air neighborhood, a stronghold for supporters of ex-president Aristide, dozens of angry men and women rushed onto the streets, hurling rocks and chunks of concrete at Sim\u00e9us' car, forcing him to flee.\"A Bitterly Divided Haiti Is Lurching Toward an Election\", New York Times, 30 Oct 2005 On September 27, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on a 6-hour visit to Haiti, publicly and pointedly called on Haiti's interim government to hold \"inclusive\" elections. Rice reportedly pressed Prime Minister G\u00e9rard Latortue for Sim\u00e9us to be readmitted to the race. On October 11, the Supreme Court ruled in Sim\u00e9us\u2019 favor, ordering the CEP to put the Texan back on the ballot. A day after the ruling, half of the members of the Supreme Court were forced into retirement by the orders of Gerard Latortue, and his justice minister.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4515870.stm ===Family=== Sim\u00e9us is married and a father of three.
