It is down the line from via . ==History== The first railway to reach Pulborough was that from Horsham to Petworth, opened on 10 October 1859 and extended to in 1866. Pulborough and were the only two intermediate stations at the time. Four years later a link was made to the Brighton to Portsmouth line; the new line diverged from the Petworth branch at Hardham Junction just south of Pulborough. Three platform faces were provided: a Down side platform on which the main station buildings stood, and an island platform whose western face was used by Midhurst line trains. By World War II, these terminated at Pulborough rather than running to Horsham or beyond. Goods facilities and a cattle market were provided. Passenger train services to Midhurst and were withdrawn in 1955, leaving just the Arun Valley Line serving Pulborough. The goods yard was closed in the mid-1960s and converted into a car park, and the goods shed is now a car repair centre. The station buildings, including a large, wide canopy on the island platform, remain largely unchanged but only two platform faces are now in use. The former up loop line used by Midhurst line trains has been removed. ==Services== The typical Monday-Saturday off peak service is: *2 trains per hour (tph) to *2 tph to Bognor Regis On Sundays this is reduced to: *1 tph to London Victoria *1 tph to Bognor Regis and Portsmouth Harbour (dividing at Barnham) ==Gallery== File:Pulborough Station 02 (07-07-2007).JPG|Northward view with London Victoria train that has departed the station File:Pulboroughstation.jpg|Southward view from the island platform File:Pulborough Station 04 (07-07-2007).JPG|Another general southward view File:Pulborough Station 06 (07-07-2007).JPG|The signal box and filled-in Midhurst platform File:Pulborough Station 10 (07-07-2007).JPG|Station buildings from the platforms File:Pulborough Station 12 (07-07-2007).JPG|Station buildings with a Portsmouth-bound train arriving at Platform 2 in the foreground. ==References== ==External links== Category:Horsham District Category:Railway stations in West Sussex Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1859 Category:Railway stations served by Southern ",
