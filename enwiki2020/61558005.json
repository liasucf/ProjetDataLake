    "text": "Villa Madama in Attard Interior of Villa Madama Philip Tortell or Filippo Tortell was a Maltese architect. Tortell built three private residences for wealthy Dr Filippo Nicol\u00f2 Buttigieg, a Maltese lawyer with extensive travel experience to Europe: in Main Street, Balzan; in Tign\u00e9 Street, Sliema (signed by Giuseppe Psaila); and Villa Madama, Attard (1925). According to Mark G. Muscat, \"Villa Madama shows clear indication of similarities to Frank Lloyd Wright's motifs, particularly in the interior. On the other hand, the house in Tign\u00e9 Street is reminiscent of the style of Louis Sullivan's handling of fa\u00e7ade decoration\". According to Edward Said, Tortell \"designed buildings on corner of St. Anthony Street and Tigne\u2019 Street without any floral motifs. It has been suggested that he drew inspiration from contemporary American star architect Frank Lloyd Wright\"Sliema's Built Heritage, FAA The \u2018Maronna\u2019, \u2018Licinia\u2019 and \u2018Lavinia\u2019 houses in Qui-Si-Sana, Sliema are also of Tortell's design, \"of a unique type of Art Deco architecture designed by Filippo Tortell in the early 1930s\". Their Italian-sounding names are deemed to have been in defiance to British colonial authorities.Malta Today Tortell also authored the Basilica of Christ the King in Paola, Malta. \"When Paola was made a parish in 1910, the need for a new church was being felt much more, especially when, ten years later, the population exceeded 5000. The idea to build a new church originated when Parish Priest Nerik Bonnici went to live in a house near Guze D'Amato who offered to prepare and design the plans. Three designs were prepared, out of which one was chosen and the architect Philip Tortell was made responsible for the project... On 30th June, 1923, the first foundation stone was laid.\" Alamy ==References== Category:20th-century Maltese architects ",
