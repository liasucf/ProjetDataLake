    "text": "Us is the second album from Scottish indie band Mull Historical Society, and the follow-up to Loss. It includes the singles \"The Final Arrears\" and \"Am I Wrong\". Us (2003) received generally positive reviews; NME called it \"a joyous slice of orchestral prozac\". The track \"The Supermarket Strikes Back\" is a riposte to \"Barcode Bypass\" from Loss. After the album was released the record label, Warners, dropped the band. ==Track listing== #\"The Final Arrears\" \u2013 5:02 #\"Am I Wrong\" \u2013 3:29 #\"Oh Mother\" \u2013 3:05 #\"Asylum\" \u2013 4:38 #\"Live Like the Automatics\" \u2013 4:09 #\"Don't Take Your Love Away from Me\" \u2013 3:52 #\"Minister for Genetics & Insurance M.P.\" \u2013 5:25 #\"5 More Minutes\" \u2013 3:32 #\"Gravity\" \u2013 4:04 #\"Can\" \u2013 3:42 #\"The Supermarket Strikes Back\" \u2013 4:23 #\"Clones\" \u2013 4:33 #\"Her Is You\" \u2013 1:58 #\"Us/Whiting of the People\" \u2013 7:38 #\"Can\u2019t Do It (CD Rom track)\" #\"You Asked Her to Marry You (CD Rom track)\" #\"MHS Lady (CD Rom track)\" #\"When I\u2019m Awake (Cavum) (CD Rom track)\" ==References== Category:2003 singles Category:Mull Historical Society albums ",
