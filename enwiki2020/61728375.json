    "text": "Ernest-Charles Las\u00e8gue (5 September 1816-20 March 1883) was a French physician that released over one hundred scientific papers. He became recognized in the mid-19th century from his work in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. He published many of his works in a journal called Archives G\u00e9n\u00e9rales de M\u00e9decine (Archives of General Medicine), in which he was an editor.Wartenberg, R. (1951). Las\u00e8gue sign and Kernig sign: historical notes. AMA Archives of Neurology & Psychiatry, 66(1), 58-60. A few of his major contributions consisted of his work with delusions of persecutions, a concept coined \"folie \u00e0 deux,\" and his description of hysterical anorexia.Chabrol, H., & Corraze, J. (2001). Charles Las\u00e8gue, 1809\u20131883. American Journal of Psychiatry, 158(1), 28-28. Aside from his publications, he worked various jobs before becoming the Chair of Clinical Medicine at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital. He remained positioned there until dying at the age of 66 due to complications from diabetes.Vandereycken, W., & Deth, R. (1990). A Tribute to Las\u00e8gue's Description of Anorexia Nervosa (1873), with Completion of its English Translation. British Journal of Psychiatry, 157(6), 902-908. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Ernest-Charles Las\u00e8gue was born on September 5, 1816, in Paris, France. His father, Antoine Las\u00e8gue, was a librarian and botanist. Recognizing his son's potential at an early age, he enrolled him at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris where Las\u00e8gue quickly distinguished himself among his peers. He spoke fluent Latin, showed a great comprehension of the Greek language, and excelled in philosophy and rhetoric.Dalfardi, B., & Mahmoudi Nezhad, G. (2014). Ernest-Charles Las\u00e8gue (1816\u20131883). Journal of Neurology, 261(11), 2247-2248. ===Education=== In 1838, Las\u00e8gue was offered a teaching position at the lyc\u00e9e by Victor Cousin, his philosophy teacher, which he accepted at the age of 22. Las\u00e8gue met and became good friends with physiologist Claude Bernard and psychiatrist B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel. Interns at the time, both Bernard and Morel worked under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Falret at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital.Streletski, C. (1908). Essai sur Ch. Las\u00e8gue, 1816\u20131881. Steinheil: Paris. Influenced by his friends and Falret, Las\u00e8gue enrolled in the Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine at the University of Paris in 1839 but it wasn't until he attended a lecture from Armand Trousseau at the H\u00f4pital Necker that he decided to abandon his studies in philosophy and pursue an education in medicine with a particular interest in psychiatry. Las\u00e8gue became a favorite pupil of Trousseau, as well as a dear friend, and went on to collaborate with him on multiple publications. He received his doctoral degree in 1847.Vandereycken, W., & Van Deth, R. (1989). Who was the first to describe anorexia nervosa: Gull or Las\u00e8gue? Psychological Medicine, 19(4), 837-845. That summer, he was summoned by the French government and sent to Southern Russia to study and research the cholera epidemic. === Occupations === Las\u00e8gue became fascinated with medicine, especially psychiatry. His period of time at the Prefecture de Police working as a physician consultant further fostered that interest. During this line of work, he was responsible for analyzing people who committed crimes. Las\u00e8gue wrote articles about abnormal behaviour when common patterns were found in the standardized notes he would take of his cases.Koehler, P. J., Bruyn, G. W., & Pearce, J. (2000). Neurological eponyms. New York: Oxford University Press. Las\u00e8gue was also a physician at Piti\u00e9- Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital and H\u00f4tel Necker and was employed as Trousseau's Chef de Clinique from 1852 to 1854. In 1853, he obtained his agr\u00e9gation with his thesis \"De la paralysie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale progressive.\" That same year, he became editor of the Archives g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de M\u00e9dicine. He gave multiple lectures on mental and nervous diseases throughout the 1860s and became professor of clinical medicine at the H\u00f4tel Necker in 1867. In 1869 at the Piti\u00e9- Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, he became the Chair of clinical medicine. Shortly afterwards, he was elected member of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine. He died on March 20, 1883 from complications relating to diabetes at the age of 66. == Contributions in medicine and psychiatry == ===General paralysis and thesis of aggregation=== In the year 1846, Las\u00e8gue graduated from medicine and completed his thesis on vitalistic doctrine from the work done by George Stahl. Following this in 1853, he obtained his professorship and put forth his work on progressive generalized paralysis.Finn, M.R. (2005). Doctors, Malady, and Creativity in Rachilde. Nineteenth-Century French Studies 34(1), 121-133. Almost a decade later, he educated patients at Salpetriere about neurological and mental diseases through the course he taught. He also received another professorship in the 1860s, this time for General Pathology. Due to his work on general paralysis, Las\u00e8gue was able to point out how varying determinants can manifest as the same symptom regardless being caused by brain disorders. This work was later published by Falret.Falret Goetz, C. G., Goetz, B. G., Bonduelle, M., & Gelfand, T. (1995). Charcot: constructing neurology. Oxford University Press on Demand. ===Delusions of persecution (aka \"Lasegue Disease\")=== In his 1852 publication \"Delire de Persecutions\", Las\u00e8gue was the first to introduce the idea that typical persecutory delusions were a disorder of its own. He disagreed with both the view of new wave neurologists and old school theorists; he divided persecutory delusions into two categories: general and partial, and argued that further divisions were not unnecessary.Dowbiggin, I. (2000). Delusional diagnosis? The history of paranoia as a disease concept in the modern era. History of Psychiatry, 11(41), 037\u2013069. He theorized that symptoms were not seen in people under the age of 28 and were more common in women. Additionally, he proposed that the cause of delusions was independent of socioeconomic status, intelligence, and mood. Contrary to popular belief at the time, he believed that auditory hallucinations were not necessarily the cause or effect of persecutory delusions.Berrios, G. E. (1996). The history of mental symptoms. Cambridge University Press. ===Earliest accounts of anorexia nervosa=== Las\u00e8gue undertook many clinical observations therefore was one of the first to cultivate objective psychology. He firmly believed that in order to determine the cause of mental illnesses, it is crucial that a patient's history is recorded in detail. This is why he clearly established the roles of psychiatry and physiology as being complementary. Las\u00e8gue took a great interest in psychosomatic disorders. In his classic paper \"De l\u2019Anorexie Hyst\u00e9rique\" written in 1873, he described hysterical anorexia. Even though a description of a condition similar to anorexia called hysterical apepsia was published by a British physician named William Gull 5 years prior, their descriptions differed. This is because Las\u00e8gue focused on aspects revolving around psychological systems, such as the role of family interactions and parental attitudes. Despite this however, both Las\u00e8gue and Gull did not acknowledge the fear people have of weight gain and their overall body image which is actually classified as one of the diagnostic criteria today for anorexia nervosa. Again, Las\u00e8gue provided more description in his work as he gathered information from eight cases and concluded that this mental illness involved gradually decreasing the amount of food consumed and also becoming more strict with food preferences.Soh, N., Walter, G., Robertson, M., & Malhi, G. S. (2010). Charles Las\u00e8gue (1816\u20131883): beyond anorexie hyst\u00e9rique. Acta Neuropsychiatrica, 22(6), 300-301. ===Concept of \"folie \u00e0 deux\" === In their 1877 publication \"La folie a deux (ou folie communiquee)\", Las\u00e8gue alongside Falret were the first to introduce a term called Las\u00e8gue\u2013Falret syndrome or \"folie a deux\", which translated to \"insanity of two\".Lazarus, A. (1985). Folie \u00e0 deux: psychosis by association or genetic determinism?. Comprehensive psychiatry, 26(2), 129-135. They described a shared psychological disorder in which delusional symptoms are transferred from one psychotic individual to one or multiple closely associated healthy individuals. Lasegue and Falret acknowledged that typical psychotic behaviour was not contagious. Therefore, they took an interest in the role of interpersonal communication in transferring psychosis. In their paper, they described communication between three pairs of closely associated individuals. The direction of communication was from: an adult to a child, an adult to an elderly individual, and an elderly individual to an adult. They theorized that the pairs\u2019 proximity of contact, duration of contact, and imbalance in intellect and suggestibility (the child being less intelligent and more gullible) allowed the syndrome to manifest.Lasegue, C. E., & Falret, J. (2016). La folie \u00e0 deux (ou folie communiqu\u00e9e). Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental & Neuro Sciences, 9(2), 62\u201368. They also suggested that transference was more common among women who were living in confinement.Arnone, D., Patel, A., & Tan, G. M.-Y. (2006). The nosological significance of Folie \u00e0 Deux: a review of the literature. Ann Gen Psychiatry, 5(11). Their paper was only translated to English in 1964, despite being referenced several times. However, their coined term \"folie a deux\" is still commonly used internationally amongst the psychiatric vocabulary today. The Las\u00e8gue's sign, also known as the straight leg raise, is a test used in the physical examination of patients with low back pain to determine the presence of sciatic pain. ===Eponym Las\u00e8gue\u2019s sign'=== One of Las\u00e8gue's most well known contributions to neurology was termed \"Las\u00e8gue\u2019s sign\" otherwise known as \"Las\u00e8gue\u2019s test.\" In his publication he introduced effects that manifest from stretching the sciatic nerve by flexing the hip and extending the leg. In the field of clinical practice, it became the standard test. He actually stated in his 1864 paper that the level of pain will not increase from passively extending or flexing the leg. This means it was most likely that he had not tried it with the combination flexing the hip at the time. However, Las\u00e8gue noted that he could tell malingerers apart from patients experiencing real sciatic pain by just conducting the leg raise test. Although Las\u00e8gue was the one to emphasize its presence in sciatica and the importance it held for diagnostics, it was his student named Forst in 1881 who first described the sign.Passive Straight Leg Raise Test: Definition, Interpretation, Limitations and Utilization. (2014). Journal of Current Clinical Care , 4(6).Schmidt, Eder & Simanke, Richard. (2014). CHARLES LAS\u00c8GUE: A RESISTANCE TO AN \"ORGANICIST\" ALIENISM 1. ===Described exhibitionism === In 1877, Las\u00e8gue described the phenomenon of exhibitionism. Shortly after this, the term started to appear in literature with no significant changes being made of the description to date. Las\u00e8gue believed that the behaviour of an exhibitionist was only typical of males, and was marked by an intense urge to display their genitals. Although Las\u00e8gue described this phenomenon as impulsive, acts of this display typically seemed to occur at the same areas with the same victims.Myers, R. G., & Berah, E. F. (1983). Some features of Australian exhibitionists compared with pedophiles. Archives of sexual behavior, 12(6), 541-547. ===Study on alcoholism=== Las\u00e8gue was recognized as one of the most prominent French specialists in alcoholism. His daily work routine consisted of a great number of alcoholic patients whom he studied and accessed in police hospitals. He conducted research on intoxicated patients and the sufferers\u2019 obsessions. His study on alcoholism lead him to the belief that alcoholic disorder, is in fact, a mental disorder. However, Las\u00e8gue had several critics to his theory, as they argued that alcoholic delirium was \"a vague concept that it filled asylums with people who were neither true alcoholics or true lunatics.\" At last, doctors needed to revise and re-examine the classification and description of alcoholism, as it didn't fit the concept that all alcoholics are mentally ill.Prestwich, P.E. (1994). Drinkers, Drunkards, and Degenerates: The Alcoholic Population of a Parisian Asylum, 1867-1914. ===Scurvy=== Las\u00e8gue described the conditions people faced in the scurvy epidemic from extreme food shortages in his publication. He accurately described the symptoms of scurvy while really focusing on the impact that the cold and nutritional deficits had. He believed these to be key factors, especially for the group of German prisoners at the H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9 he cared for.Walusinski, O. (2016). Neurology and Neurologists during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). War Neurology, 38(1), 77-92. Las\u00e8gue, alongside another physician named Alexis Charles Legroux, when on to establish a correlation between cases of scurvy in German prisons and the lack of physical activity relative to the duration of enclosure.Magiorkinis, E., Beloukas, A., & Diamantis, A. (2011). Scurvy: past, present and future. European journal of internal medicine, 22(2), 147-152. ==Publications == Ernest-Charles Las\u00e9gue had \"published about 115 scientific papers on different medical topics in the areas of neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, and the history of medicine.\" His most prominent publications include: * Archives G\u00e9n\u00e9rales de M\u00e9decine (Archives of General Medicine), 1823- issued majority of his papers here. * De l\u2019Anorexie Hyst\u00e9rique (Hysterical Anorexia), 1873- Las\u00e9gue speaks about Hysterical Anorexia and the psychological aspect of the disorder. * La folie a deux, 1877 (accompanied by Jean-Pierre Falret)- introduced the Las\u00e9gue-Falret Syndrome, a psychological disorder and spoke in-depth about the disorder. * Les C\u00e9r\u00e9braux, 1880- Las\u00e9gue addresses the significance of psychosomatic medicine associated with medicine overall. * Questions de therapeutique mentale, 1884- Las\u00e9gue examines delusional ideas. ==References == Category:French psychiatrists Category:1816 births Category:1883 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
