    "text": "The Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary (CCAD) from HarperCollins, first published in 1987 is a dictionary that distinguished itself by providing definitions in full sentences rather than excerpted phrases. Example sentences are given for almost every meaning of every word, drawn from a large corpus of actual usage. Except for the 6th edition, it included phonetic transcriptions based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In some editions, a digital version on CD-ROM was included with the dictionary in book form. The CCAD seems to skimp on American English, but there is its equivalent titled Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of American English. ==Editions== *First edition published in 1987 as Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary *Second edition published in 1995 as Collins COBUILD Learner's Dictionary *Third published in 2001 as Collins COBUILD English Dictionary for Advanced Learners *Fourth published in 2003 as Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner's English Dictionary *Fifth published in 2006 *Sixth edition published in 2008 as Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary (CCAD) *Seventh edition published in 2012 as Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of English *Eighth edition published in 2014 as Collins COBUILD Advanced Learner's Dictionary *Ninth edition published in 2018 ==Notes== == External links == *Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary Category:English dictionaries ",
