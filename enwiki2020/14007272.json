    "text": "Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala (Polish for Lw\u00f3w's Merry Wave) was a weekly radio program of the Polish Radio Lwow, broadcast every Sunday by the Polish Radio. The broadcast, composed mostly of light music, sketches and humour, was among the most popular programmes of the Polish Radio in the period between the world wars. Started in 1933, it remained on the air until the Invasion of Poland of 1939. As the idea of an all-day-long programme prepared by one of the regional branches of the Polish Radio, rather than by the central editorial office, was a novelty, the initial broadcasts were prepared almost free of charge by amateur journalists and comedians. With time it became one of the most successful broadcasts of the Polish Radio, recognized countrywide. The author of most of the sketches was Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski. Among the best-known comedians associated with the Merry Wave were the Szczepcio and To\u0144cio duo, known for their dialogues in the Lw\u00f3w dialect. Other notable personalities were Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer and Adolf Fleischen who parodied the local Jewish community, as well as W\u0142ada Majewska, Wilhelm Korabiowski and many more. After the outbreak of World War II most of the artists were mobilized into the Polish Army and successfully evacuated from Poland. They served as the Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala Theatre on various fronts of the war. After the war most of them remained in exile. ==Sources== * * * ==See also== *Radio stations in interwar Poland ==External links== *One of the most popular songs about prewar Lwow, sung by Kazimierz Wajda and Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger *W\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119gi, a 1939 film, featuring most popular characters of the Merry Lw\u00f3w Wave Category:Polish radio programs Category:Culture in Lviv Category:1933 radio programme debuts Category:1939 radio programme endings Category:Comedy radio programs Category:History of Lviv ",
