    "text": "Flanker 2.0 is a combat flight simulator developed by Eagle Dynamics released in 1999. In 2001, a major patch titled Flanker 2.5 was released for free to users who already owned Flanker 2.0, but was also available as a fully new purchasable game. ==Reception== Flanker 2.5 won PC Gamer USs \"2002 Best Simulation\" award. The magazine's Andy Mahood wrote, \"When a $10 upgrade package (for a three-year-old combat flight sim, no less!) takes our 2002 Flight Sim of the Year honors, it's a remarkably sad commentary on the state of the genre\". However, he praised the game as superior to Combat Flight Simulator 3 and Strike Fighters: Project 1, and declared that it \"absolutely deserves\" players' attention. == References == ==External links== * Flanker 2.0 at MobyGames * http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/flanker-25-review/1900-2863737/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20050112000010/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/april02/flanker/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20051227233811/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r15531.htm Category:1999 video games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:Ubisoft games Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ",
