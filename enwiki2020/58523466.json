The leaves are alternate, distichous and 1-foliolate, with a narrow lamina. It flowers from late winter to spring with flowers which are about 20 mm long and on pedicels which are 3\u20135 mm long. The bracts are few, obtuse and less than 1 mm long with the bracteoles being similar (and sometimes persistent). The sparsely pubescent calyx is 5\u20137 mm long. The standard and wing petals are mostly yellow or orange, while the keel is dark red and longer than the other petals by 8\u201310 mm. The ovary is glabrous and has about 8 ovules, while the pod is about 15-20 mm long and oblong. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described as Bossiaea rupicola in 1864 by Allan Cunningham. The name has not been revised, and nor are there any synonyms. == References == == External links == * The Australasian Virtual Herbarium \u2013 Bossiaea rupicola occurrence data * Thompson, I.R.
