In addition, it invokes a law that allows the President to bar transactions involving donations, food, clothing, and medicine and other articles \"intended to be used to relieve human suffering\", when the President finds donations would \"seriously impair his ability to deal with any national emergency\", are coerced or would endanger U.S. armed forces. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
