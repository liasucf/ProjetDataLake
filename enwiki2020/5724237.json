Introduction to Herpetology, Third Edition. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman. xi + 378 pp. . (Genus Enhydris, pp. 326-327). ==Species== The following 6 species are recognized:\"Enhydris \". ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). www.itis.gov.\"Enhydris \". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. * Enhydris chanardi Murphy & Voris, 2005 * Enhydris enhydris (Schneider, 1799) * Enhydris innominata (Morice, 1875) * Enhydris jagorii (W. Peters, 1863) * Enhydris longicauda (Bourret, 1934) * Enhydris subtaeniata (Bourret, 1934) Several additional species have traditionally been placed here, but are now often in genera such as Subsessor and Pseudoferania. Another species, Enhydris smithi , was considered to be a valid species by herpetologists M.A. Smith 1943, Das 2010, and Wallach et al. 2014, but was considered to be a synonym of Enhydris jagorii by Cox et al. 1998, and Murphy & Voris 2014.\"Enhydris jagorii \". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Enhydris. ==Etymology== The specific names, jagorii and smithi, are in honor of German naturalist Fedor Jagor and British herpetologist Malcolm Arthur Smith, respectively.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).
