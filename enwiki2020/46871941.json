Its headquarters was at Youngsfield in Cape Town, where the Artillery Air Defence School had been established from the same date. ===Incidents=== 13 October 2007: An Oerlikon GDF Mk.5 35 mm anti-aircraft twin-barrelled gun malfunctioned, spraying hundreds of high-explosive 0,5 kg 35mm cannon shells around the five-gun firing position. By the time the gun had emptied its dual 250-round magazines, nine soldiers were dead and eleven injured. The accident occurred just before 9 am, when a battery from 10 Anti- Aircraft Regiment began a live-fire exercise at the Army Combat Training Centre at Lohatlha as part of the SANDF's Exercise Seboka.http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/9-killed-in-army-horror-374838 ===Starstreak missile development=== 10 AA Regiment participated in the first live firing of Starstreak missiles on African soil.
