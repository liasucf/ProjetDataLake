    "text": "Sadhan Kumar Adhikari is a Brazilian-Indian professor of physics, since 1991, at the Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT) of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP). ==Early life== Sadhan Kumar Adhikari was born to Nalini Ranjan and Mira Adhikari on 2 January 1948 in Kharagpore, India. In 1962 he graduated from Hindu School, Kolkata and then joined the Bachelor of Science program at the Presidency University, Kolkata which he finished with honours by 1965. The same year he started the Master of Science course at the Calcutta University which he completed by 1968. For a year he was a post-M.Sc fellow at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, India and in 1973 obtained PhD in physics from the University of Pennsylvania, USA. From 1973 to 1976 worked at the University of New South Wales, Australia as a post-doc scholar and since 1976 till 1991 was an associate professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco , Brazil. ==Research== He contributed to the area of few-body scattering in nuclear and atomic physics, renormalization in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, and the physics of cold atoms and superfluids. He formulated the quantum scattering theory in two dimensions using Lippmann\u2013Schwinger equations and the asymptotic wave function for scattering. From 2002 to 2009 he used Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation to study the formation of bright solitons in a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate using FORTRAN 77 programs. He, in collaboration with P. Muruganandam and Antun Bala\u017e, and colleagues from the Institute of Physics, Scientific Computing Laboratory, Belgrade wrote popular Fortran and C programs to solve the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation and study properties of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates using the Crank\u2013Nicolson method. He is the author of two books on scattering theory published by Academic Press, San Francisco, Hard cover (1988), Paperback (2012) and eTextbook (2012) and by John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1998 ==Awards== Dr. Adhikari is a Graduate fellow of the University of Pennsylvania (1970), and a Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1996). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Federal University of Pernambuco faculty Category:University of New South Wales faculty Category:National Science Foundation Category:University of Pennsylvania fellows Category:S\u00e3o Paulo State University faculty ",
