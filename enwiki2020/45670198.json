    "text": "Emanuel Buchmann (born 18 November 1992) is a German professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam . In 2015 he won the German National Road Race Championships. He has competed in the Tour de France four times, finishing fourth in 2019, and twice in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, in 2017 and 2018. ==Career== Buchmann is the son of carpenter Manfred Buchmann and hails from Vogt near Ravensburg in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. , he lives in Bregenz, Austria. === Bora\u2013Argon 18 (2015\u2013present) === ==== 2015 ==== Buchmann at the 2015 Tour de France In 2015, Buchmann denied the strong sprinters their chance at the German National Road Race Championships when he attacked from a leading group to take the title. During the subsequent Tour de France, he finished a strong third on the stage finishing at the top of the Col du Tourmalet. ==== 2017 ==== Buchmann (right) finishing second behind teammate Marcus Burghardt at the 2017 German National Road Race Championships After a quieter 2016 season, he finished tenth at the 2017 Tour de Romandie, losing a podium position only during the race's final stage time trial. Buchmann then finished seventh overall and first in the young riders' classification at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, one of the major preparation races for the Tour de France. During the last stage, he finished ahead of strong general classification riders such as Chris Froome, Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador at Plateau de Solaison. Buchmann commented after the stage that he was delighted to have been able to \"stay with the best\" of the race. At the German National Road Race Championships the week after, Buchmann set up the victory for his teammate Marcus Burghardt, finishing in second place. His form faded slightly at the Tour de France, where he was set to work for team leader Rafa\u0142 Majka, who withdrew early; he eventually finished in 15th place overall. ==== 2018 ==== Buchmann opened the season strong, with a 10th place overall at the Abu Dhabi Tour. He followed that up with his best result, at that time, 4th at the Tour of the Basque Country. He finished 9th at the Tour de Romandie, and 18th at the Eschborn\u2013Frankfurt race. At the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 in June, Buchmann finished sixth in the general classification, repeating his strong performance from the previous year. He attacked multiple times on the final stage, but was brought back and finished the stage fourth. He was selected to ride the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. He performed well in the opening stages. On stage 4, he attacked the group of favourites on the finishing climb of Alfacar, gaining time which moved him into second place overall, within seven seconds of the race lead. After falling back during the subsequent mountain stages, Buchmann eventually finished the Vuelta in 12th place overall, his best result in a Grand Tour up to that point. ====2019==== Buchmann raced the Tour of the Basque Country, winning stage 5 after attacking on the penultimate climb of the day to take the overall lead. He lost the leader's jersey on the final stage of the race. In the closing metres, Buchmann took a wrong turn and lost significant time. The time he lost through this was later reinstated, meaning that he finished the race in third overall. At the Tour de Romandie, Buchmann finished seventh overall. In preparation for the upcoming Tour de France, Buchmann raced the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, where he finished third overall, after Adam Yates abandoned the event during the final stage, handing the podium spot to Buchmann. He remained in good form all the way through the Tour, answering nearly every attack by the elite general classification riders. By the time the race reached the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he was barely two minutes behind race leader Egan Bernal, just off the podium in fourth place. ====2020==== Buchmann started his 2020 season strongly, winning the Trofeo de Tramuntana, the second leg of the Challenge Mallorca. He was part of a breakaway that formed on the penultimate climb of the day and used the descent to create a gap, which he held to the finish. His last race before the season was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic was the UAE Tour, which he was forced to abandon after a crash. His next objectives after racing resumes were the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 before leading his team at the Tour de France. At the Dauphin\u00e9, Buchmann was third overall when a crash on stage four forced him to withdraw. The injuries he sustained put his Tour de France participation in doubt, but he eventually started the race. ==Major results== ;2010 : 9th Ronde van Vlaanderen Junioren : 10th Overall Tour du Valromey ;2012 : 6th Overall Tour d'Azerba\u00efdjan ;2014 : 3rd Overall Okolo Ji\u017en\u00edch \u010cech ::1st Stage 3 : 7th Overall Tour de l'Avenir : 7th GP Capodarco : 8th Overall Tour d'Azerba\u00efdjan : 8th Overall Mzansi Tour ;2015 : 1st 20px Road race, National Road Championships : 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Giro del Trentino ;2016 : 4th Rudi Altig Race : 8th Overall Giro del Trentino ;2017 : 2nd Road race, National Road Championships : 6th Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana : 7th Overall Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 ::1st 20px Young rider classification : 7th Overall Tour of the Alps : 10th Overall Tour de Romandie : 10th Vuelta a Murcia ;2018 : 4th Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 6th Overall Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 : 7th Overall Tour de Pologne : 9th Overall Tour de Romandie : 10th Overall Abu Dhabi Tour ;2019 : 1st Trofeo Andratx\u2013Lloseta : 2nd Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country ::1st Stage 5 : 3rd Overall Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 : 4th Overall Tour de France : 4th Overall UAE Tour : 4th Gran Piemonte : 7th Overall Tour de Romandie : 8th Giro di Lombardia ;2020 : 1st Trofeo Serra de Tramuntana : 9th Pollen\u00e7a\u2013Andratx ===General classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |colspan=7 align=\"center\"|Grand Tour general classification results |- ! scope=\"col\" |Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 2015 ! scope=\"col\" | 2016 ! scope=\"col\" | 2017 ! scope=\"col\" | 2018 ! scope=\"col\" | 2019 ! scope=\"col\" | 2020 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" |alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia | style=\"color:#4d4d4d;\" colspan=6|Has not contested during his career |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" |alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France | 83 | 21 | 15 | \u2014 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |4 | 38 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" |alt=A red jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a | \u2014 | \u2014 | 65 | 12 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- |colspan=7 align=\"center\"|Major stage race general classification results |- !Race ! scope=\"col\" | 2015 ! scope=\"col\" | 2016 ! scope=\"col\" | 2017 ! scope=\"col\" | 2018 ! scope=\"col\" | 2019 ! scope=\"col\" | 2020 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Paris\u2013Nice | \u2014 | \u2014 | DNF | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Tirreno\u2013Adriatico | \u2014 | 66 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Volta a Catalunya | style=\"color:#4d4d4d;\" colspan=5|Has not contested during his career | style=\"color:#4d4d4d;\" rowspan=3|NH |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Tour of the Basque Country | \u2014 | \u2014 | 13 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |4 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |3 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Tour de Romandie | \u2014 | \u2014 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |10 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |9 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |7 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 | 32 | 20 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |7 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |6 | style=\"background:#ddddff;\" |3 | DNF |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Tour de Suisse | style=\"color:#4d4d4d;\" colspan=5|Has not contested during his career | style=\"color:#4d4d4d;\"|NH |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |} ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:German male cyclists Category:People from Ravensburg Category:German cycling road race champions Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Germany ",
