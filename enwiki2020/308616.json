    "text": "Phelsuma astriata semicarinata is a subspecies of Seychelles day gecko. It is a small, slender gecko, has a bright green colour and feeds on insects. It is found on different islands of the Seychelles, where it often lives near human dwellings. == Description == The body of this smallish day gecko is lime green with rost-coloured dots and bars on the back which are irregularly shaped. Those reddish dots form a thin mid-dorsdal stripe, which may be broken and may have some bars extending from it. There is a rust-coloured stripe between the nostril and the eye. On the head there is a rust-coloured, v-shaped marking with two transverse bars. Males often have a bluish or turquoise coloured tail and lower back. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe is extending from the nostrils to the eye. The undersurface of the body is white. These lizards reach a total length of about 12.5 cm. == Distribution == This gecko is endemic to the Seychelles island Praslin but it has also been introduced to La R\u00e9union, where it had been recorded first in 2004.[Mozzi, D\u00e9so & Probst, 2005. Un nouveau gecko vert introduit \u00e0 la R\u00e9union: Le Phelsuma astriata semicarinata (Cheke, 1982). - Bulletin Phaethon 21: 1-4 http://reptilvar.free.fr/Gecko_introduit_Reunion.pdf] == Habitat == This species is typically found on coconut palms and banana trees. It often lives near human settlements. == Diet == These day geckos feed on insects, small spiders, fruit, nectar and pollen. == Reproduction == Phelsuma astriata semicarinata normally lays two 10 mm large eggs. The eggs are not glued to leaves, as this species is among the \"non-gluer\" variety. Eggs should generally hatch in 70 \u2013 75 days and should be incubated at approximately 25 degrees Celsius.Day Geckos in Captivity by Lean and Greg Christenson, Page 114 (2002) == Care and maintenance in captivity == Phelsuma astriata semicarinata should be housen in pairs. They need a vertically oriented and well planted terrarium with vertically oriented and horizontally oriented bambus sticks as thick as a thumb. == Bibliography == *Henkel, F.-W. and W.
