    "text": "Pennantia is the sole genus in the plant family Pennantiaceae. In older classifications, it was placed in the family Icacinaceae. Most authorities have recognised three or four species, depending on whether they recognised Pennantia baylisiana as a separate species from Pennantia endlicheri. Mabberley, however, has recognised only two species. Pennantia species grow naturally in New Zealand, Norfolk Island, and eastern Australia. In Australia, P. cunninghamii grows across a broad latitudinal natural range (nearly ), from the south coast of New South Wales northwards through to north eastern Queensland. == Species == The following four species were recognised by Gardner and de Lange in 2002. * Pennantia baylisiana, \u2013 Three Kings Islands * Pennantia corymbosa , 'kaik\u014dmako' \u2013 New Zealand * Pennantia cunninghamii , 'brown beech' \u2013 NSW, Qld, Australia * Pennantia endlicheri \u2013 Norfolk Island == References == == External links == * Missouri Botanical Garden Website\u2212Mobot.org: Pennantiaceae + Pennantia Category:Pennantiaceae Category:Apiales genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
