    "text": "Timr\u00e5 IK is a Swedish ice hockey team from Timr\u00e5. After failing the 2019 SHL qualifiers, Timr\u00e5 has been relegated for play in the second-tier league, HockeyAllsvenskan, in the 2019\u201320 season. Previous seasons in the top Swedish division include 1956\u201357 to 1975\u201376, 1977\u201378, 1981\u201382, and 2000\u201301 to 2012\u201313. ==History== The club origins from Wifstavarfs GIF, founded in 1921, Wifstavarvs IK, founded in 1928, and \u00d6strands IF, founded in 1931. Both clubs started playing ice hockey in 1938 and in the summer of 1942 they merged into Wifsta/\u00d6strands IF, more commonly called W/\u00d6. W/\u00d6 made its first Swedish Championship appearance in 1943. The championships were played independently from the national league at the time. Five seasons later, 1948\u201349 the team was accepted for play in the national league system in Sweden. Starting in third league, Wifsta/\u00d6strands IF won nine out of ten games and directly advanced to second league or Division II Norra (North Division). In the spring of 1956, having spent seven seasons facing teams like Bryn\u00e4s IF, Mora IK and Leksands IF, W/\u00d6 qualified for the top national league on March 10, 1956 as the top league, Division I, nicknamed Allsvenskan by many, was expanded from 6+6 to 8+8 teams, a North and South Division. In 1963, the local club Fagerviks GF was absorbed and W/\u00d6 was renamed Wifsta/\u00d6strand\u2013Fagerviks IF or simply W\u00d6F. Starting with the 1958\u201359 season, W/\u00d6 was playing its home games on an artificial ice rink. Some years later an ice arena was built, and W\u00d6F played its first indoor season 1965\u201366 under the roof of what is now NHK Arena. Just one year later, the lengthy name Wifsta/\u00d6strand\u2013Fagerviks IF was finally replaced by Timr\u00e5 IK as of 1966\u201367. Timr\u00e5 IK continued to play successful hockey and stayed in the top league in Sweden until Elitserien was formed in 1975. Having finished last of the 10 teams, the club received their first relegation and was demoted after 20 years in the top league. Back in second league for the 1976\u201377 season, Timr\u00e5 stood undefeated in all 22 games and qualified for promotion again. However, it did not last. Two one-year visits in Elitserien 1977\u201378 and 1981\u201382 ended in low results and relegation. Magnus P\u00e4\u00e4j\u00e4rvi-Svensson in Timr\u00e5 IK's primary jersey Many winters later, still in second league, an effort to regain the status of old times was made. On May 22, 1990, the collaboration Sundsvall/Timr\u00e5 Hockey was formed with the nearby club IF Sundsvall Hockey. Still no success, and just a few years after, the joint Main/Farm team relationship was ended. Some confusion followed when the former Timr\u00e5 club was named ST Hockey during the 1994\u201395 season, but is since April 6, 1995 known as Timr\u00e5 IK yet again. After qualifying for the Kvalserien in 2000, the Red Eagles finally earned promotion to Elitserien on April 14, 2000, and returned to Elitserien after 18 years of absence. Almost three years later, March 1, 2003, Timr\u00e5 IK played the Swedish Championship playoffs for the first time since 1974. In the 2007\u201308 season Timr\u00e5 IK moved up Anton Lander and Magnus P\u00e4\u00e4j\u00e4rvi-Svensson from the junior teams. Despite both being only 16 years old at the time, their game was a success. They were both offered, and signed, professional hockey contracts with the club. In the 2012\u201313 season, Timr\u00e5 finished eleventh in the regular season and therefore had to play in the 2013 Kvalserien to stay in the top-tier league, but the team finished outside the top two spots and was relegated to the second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan for the first time since the 1999\u20132000 season. After playing five seasons in HockeyAllsvenskan, Timr\u00e5 were able to earn a promotion to the SHL following the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 HockeyAllsvenskan season. Some of the key players during the season and the subsequent promotion playoffs were Jonathan Dahl\u00e9n, Vilmos Gall\u00f3, Anton Wedin and goaltender Henrik Haukeland.Direktkval till SHL #1 Victor
