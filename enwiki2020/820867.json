The album On a Distant Shore recorded in 2016, was posthumously released in September 2017. The album has 12 songs written by Leon. Leon's daughters Coco Bridges and Sugaree Noel Bridges perform backing vocals on the album. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Leon Russell among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Death and legacy== Russell died in his sleep at his suburban Nashville home in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, on November 13, 2016, at the age of 74, his wife said in a statement on his website. In 2010, he had undergone surgery, and in July 2016 he suffered a heart attack. He was recovering from heart surgery. Russell's funeral was on November 18 at Victory Baptist Church in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, and a public memorial was held at The Oral Roberts University Mabee Center on November 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is interred at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Elton John, who had once been Russell's opening act, acknowledged him as his \"biggest influence as a piano player, a singer and a songwriter.\" On hearing of Russell's death, he said: \"My darling Leon Russell passed away last night. He was a mentor, inspiration and so kind to me. I loved him and always will.\" John once recalled: Pixies vocalist Black Francis credits Russell with influencing his vocal style: \"I realise there's a certain kind of vocalising I do that takes its cue from Leon Russell. He sang in a Southern accent but it was very blown- out and exaggerated, very free and loose.\" One of Russell's titles and signature nicknames is: Master of Space and Time. ==Personal life== Russell had six children. His oldest daughter Blue was with Carla McHenry. She was born February 20, 1972 and was named Blueagle after Oklahoman and Native American Artist Acee Blue Eagle. Leon married Mary McCreary on June 20, 1975. Mary was a musical partner. They had two children, son Teddy Jack (born January 1, 1976) and daughter Tina Rose (born November 13, 1978). Leon and Mary divorced on October 3, 1980. He married Janet Lee Constantine on February 6, 1983. They had three daughters together, Sugaree Noel (born October 9, 1982), Honey (born January 19, 1986), and Coco (born April 29, 1990). In 2013 on Willie Nelson's To All the Girls... album, Willie sang the song \"After the Fire Is Gone\" with Tina Rose. ==Discography== ===Studio and live albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
