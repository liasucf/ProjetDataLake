Despite EE Jump's success, Goto disliked performing in the group and was constantly told by staff that he lacked skill in singing and keeping in rhythm. During promotions for EE Jump's fourth single, , Goto had an argument with the group's female manager over their crowded schedules, which led him to physically assault her and check out of his hotel room without permission, fleeing to Tochigi Prefecture.

After issuing an apology, Goto rejoined EE Jump in February 2002; however, shortly after graduating middle school, tabloid magazine Friday published photographs of him drinking alcohol while underage at a cabaret club in a VIP room with a member of Johnny's Jr. Wada warned Goto to keep his personal life private, but when Goto refused, he and EE Jump's music producer, Tsunku, agreed to terminate his contract, which led to EE Jump disbanding on April 13, 2002. ===2013-present: Sange and comeback=== After serving five years in prison, in 2013, Goto released a memoir titled Sange: Gomaki no Ot\u014dto to Yobarete, which discussed his parents' deaths, his relationship with his sister Maki, and his struggles with fame.
