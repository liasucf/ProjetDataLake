There's a major road in the corporate downtown in Karachi bearing his namesake as Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar Road. The Bombay University confirms his name written as Ismail Ibrahim Chundrigar in their graduating listings. (; 15 September 1897 \u2013 26 September 1960), best known as I. I. Chundrigar, was the sixth Prime Minister of Pakistan, appointed in this capacity on 17 October 1957 until being removed due to the vote of noconfidence movement on 11 December 1957. Trained in the constitutional law from Bombay and one of the Founding Fathers of the Dominion of Pakistan, Chundrigar's tenure is the second shortest served in the parliamentary history of Pakistan just after that of Nurul Amin who served as prime minister for 13 days. Chundrigar served only for just 55 days into his term himself. ==Biography== ===Early life and law practice=== Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar was born in Godhra, Gujarat in India on September 15, 1897. He was the only child of his Gujarati-speaking Chundrigar family, a Muslim community in India. From his Chundriger community, he was of the Arabian descent.Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Gujarat Population: Musalmans and Parsis, Volume IX page 72 Government Central Press, Bombay Chundrigar was initially schooled in Ahmedabad where he finished his matriculation and moved to Bombay for his higher studies. He went to attend Bombay University where he secured his graduation with the BA degree in philosophy, and later the LLB degree from Bombay University in 1929. From 1929 till 1932, Chundrigar served as a lawyer for the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. From 1932 until 1937, Chundrigar began practicing civil law, and moved to practice and read law at the Bombay High Court in 1937, where he established his reputation. During this time, he became acquainted with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, sharing the similar ideology, work ethics, and political views. In 1935, Chudrigar was represented by the Muslim League to give a response to the Government of India Act 1935 introduced by the British government in India. Over the role of the Governor-General as head of state, Chundrigar notably contradicted the powers enjoyed by the Governor-General under the act introduced in 1935. From 1937 till 1946, Chundrigar practiced and read law, taking several cases on civil matters where he advocated for his clients at the Bombay High Court. ===Legislative career in India and Pakistan Movement=== In 1936, Chundrigar joined the Muslim League and successfully participated in the provincial elections to be elected as a member of the Bombay Legislative Assembly in 1937. He took over the Muslim League's provincial presidency based in Bombay, and successfully retained his role as the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) of the Bombay Assembly for a Muhammadan Urban constituency until 1946. In 1946, he was named and appointed as Commerce Minister under the presidential administrations of Viceroys of India, Archibald Wavell (1946) and Louis Mountbatten (1946-47). Peter Lyon, a reader emeritus in international relations, describes Chundrigar as a \"close supporter\" of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the Pakistan Movement. ==Public service in Pakistan== ===Diplomacy and governorships=== After the partition of India by the act of the British Empire that laid the establishment of Pakistan, Chundrigar endorsed Liaquat Ali Khan's bid for the Premiership and was retained as the Commerce Minister in the administration of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on 15 August 1947.The Leader at pakistan.gov.pk On 1 May 1948, Chundrigar was relieved his Commerce ministry and was appointed as the Pakistan Ambassador to Afghanistan, presenting his credentials to Afghan King Zahir Shah in Kabul. Though, his appointment was met with favorable views in Afghanistan, Chundrigar was at odd with the Afghan government of supporting the issue of separating the country's north-west frontier, with Indian involvement as early as 1949. His tenureship remained for a short brief of time when he was recalled to Pakistan due to Foreign Office's objections, which viewed Chundrigar's inability to understand the Pashtun culture may have factor in fracturing relations between two nations. In 1950, Chundrigar was appointed Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, which he tenured until 1951. A Cabinet reshuffle in 1951 allowed him to be appointed as the Governor of Punjab but was removed amid differences developed in 1953 with Governor- General M.G. Muhammad when he enforced martial law at the request of Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin to control violent religious riots that occurred in Lahore, Pakistan. He was appointed as Pakistan's Ambassador to Turkey and presented his diplomatic credentials in Ankara. ===Law ministry in Coalition administration=== In 1955, Chundrigar returned to Pakistan from his ambassadorship from Turkey when he was invited to join the central government of three-party coalition: the Awami League, Muslim League and the Republican Party. He was appointed as Minister of Law and Justice. During this time, he also acted as a Leader of the Opposition, opposing the mainstream agenda presented by the Republican Party. At the National Assembly, he established his reputation as more of constitutional lawyer than a politician and gained a lot of prominence in public for his arguments in favour of parliamentarianism when he pleaded the case of \"Maulvi Tamizuddin vs. Federation of Pakistan\". ==Prime Minister of Pakistan (1957)== ===Shortest tenure as Prime Minister=== After the resignation of Prime Minister Suhrawardy in 1956, Chudrigar was nominated as the Prime Minister and was supported by Awami League, Krishak Sramik Party, Nizem-i-Islam Party, and the Republican Party. However, this coalition of mixed parties weakened him to exercise his authority to run the central government, with reaching a compromise with the Republican Party led by its presidents Feroze Khan and Iskander Mirza to amend the Electoral College. On 18 October 1957, Chundrigar became the Prime Minister of Pakistan oath from Chief Justice M. Munir. At the first session of the National Assembly, Chundrigar presented his plans to reform the Electoral College which was met with great parliamentary opposition even by his Cabinet ministers from the Republican Party and the Awami League. With President Iskander Mirza and his Republican Party exploiting and manipulating the opponents of Muslim League, a successful vote of no-confidence movement in the National Assembly by Republicans and Awami Party effectively ended Chundrigar's term when he was forced to resign from his office on 11 December 1957. Chundrigar served the shortest term of any Prime Ministers' tenure served in Pakistan: 17 October 1957 \u2013 11 December 1957, 55 days into his term. ==Death and reputation== In 1958, Chudrigar was appointed as president of the Supreme Court Bar Association which he remained until his death. In 1960, Chundrigar traveled to Hamburg where he addressed the International Law Conference and suffered a haemorrhage while visiting in London. For treatment, he was taken to the Royal Northern Hospital and suddenly died. His body was brought back to Karachi in Pakistan, where he was buried in a local cemetery. In his honour, the Government of Pakistan renamed the McLeod Road in Karachi after his namesake. ==See also== * Constitutionalism in Pakistan * Parliamentary history of Pakistan ==References== ==External links== * I.
