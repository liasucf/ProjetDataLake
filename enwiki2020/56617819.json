    "text": "For All Mankind is an American science fiction web television series created and written by Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi and produced for Apple TV+. The series dramatizes an alternate history depicting \"what would have happened if the global space race had never ended\" after the Soviet Union succeeds in the first crewed Moon landing ahead of the United States. The series stars Joel Kinnaman in the lead role as fictionalised NASA astronaut Edward Baldwin and Apollo 11 crew Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins as characters in the story. Michael Dorman, Wrenn Schmidt, Shantel VanSanten, Sarah Jones, Jodi Balfour, Michael Harney and Colm Feore appear in supporting roles in the series. Seth Gordon directed the first two episodes of season 1. For All Mankind Premiered on November 1, 2019, and was renewed by Apple TV+ in October 2019 for a second season. ==Premise== The first crewed mission to the Moon during the Space Race in the late 1960s was a global success for NASA and the United States. This drama poses the question: \"What if the Space Race had never ended?\" In an alternate timeline, a Soviet cosmonaut, Alexei Leonov, becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA, but also catalyzes an American effort to catch up. With the Soviet Union emphasizing diversity by including a woman in subsequent landings, the US is forced to match pace, training women and minorities who were largely excluded from the initial decades of US space exploration. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Joel Kinnaman as Edward Baldwin * Michael Dorman as Gordo Stevens * Wrenn Schmidt as Margo Madison * Sarah Jones as Tracy Stevens * Shantel VanSanten as Karen Baldwin * Jodi Balfour as Ellen Wilson (n\u00e9e Waverly) ===Historical figures=== * Chris Agos as Buzz Aldrin * Matt Battaglia as John Glenn * Chris Bauer as Deke Slayton * Jeff Branson as Neil Armstrong * Dan Donohue as Thomas O.
