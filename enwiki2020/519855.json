    "text": "Argenis is a book by John Barclay. It is a work of historical allegory which tells the story of the religious conflict in France under Henry III of France and Henry IV of France, and also touches on more contemporary English events, such as the Overbury scandal. The tendency is royalist, anti-aristocratic; it is told from the angle of a king who reduces the landed aristocrats' power in the interest of the \"country\", the interest of which is identified with that of the king. ==Some early editions== * 1621 - Paris, Nicolas Buon (Latin) * 1622 - London, Eliot's Court Press (Latin) * 1623 - Frankfurt, Danielis & Davidis Aubriorum & Clementis Schleichij (Latin) * 1625 - London, G.

Later translations were made by Kingsmill Long (1625), and Robert Le Gruys (1628). Clara Reeve translated it as The Phoenix (1772). ==References== * The Cambridge Companion to Writing of the English Revolution - Neil Howard Keeble (2001) ==External links== * Argenis - Edited and translated by Mark Riley & Dorothy Pritchard Huber (2004) * Argenida - Scans of a Polish poetic translation by Wac\u0142aw Potocki, Warszawa 1697 * Argenis in Latin - 2nd edition.
