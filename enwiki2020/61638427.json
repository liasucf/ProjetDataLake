In 1863, he enrolled in the preparatory department of Loyola College in Maryland, where he studied for two years. He then entered the Society of Jesus, and was sent to the Jesuit novitiate in Frederick, Maryland, in August 1865. There, he was the spiritual reader to the Jesuit brothers. He remained in Frederick until 1869, before completing his higher studies at Woodstock College. A member of the first class at Woodstock, he studied philosophy for three years. In 1872, Daugherty was sent to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to teach mathematics. After two years, he was transferred to Boston College, where he continued teaching, now Latin and Ancient Greek. He then resumed his education at Woodstock College in 1877, taking up the study of theology under Camillo Mazzella, a future cardinal. In June 1880, he was ordained a priest by Cardinal James Gibbons.

The following year, he became minister and vice president at Gonzaga College, where he was well-liked and remained for four years. He was then transferred to Georgetown, where he remained a minister for seven years. In 1895, he went continued his ministry at Woodstock College, and took up the additional positions of professor of mathematics and treasurer. The following year, he was sent to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, as minister. In January 1901, he returned to New York, where he was appointed , or advisor to the Jesuit provincial superior. However, he remained in this position for only a few months, before being appointed president of Georgetown University. === Georgetown University === Succeeding John D. Whitney, Daugherty took office on July 11, 1901. During his presidency, he undertook several building campaigns. He oversaw the start of construction on Ryan Gymnasium, and as well as the erection of Ida Ryan Hall, which required built in the place of the demolished Old South Hall (the oldest building on campus). He also saw that a new wing of the Georgetown University Hospital was built, as well as Kober operating amphitheater, and the Hirst Library, which was dedicated on December 18, 1902.

This included adding a fourth year to the course of study at the Law School, beginning lectures in ethics at the School of Medicine, and presided over the establishment of the antecedents of the School of Dentistry, which was then a department of the School of Medicine. There had long been tension between Georgetown and the Catholic University of America, which opened in Washington, D.C., in 1887. During Daugherty's tenure, the president of Catholic University complained to the Jesuit provincial superior that Georgetown's graduate programs were detracting from those of Catholic University. As a result, the provincial ordered Daugherty in 1903 to revise the graduate curriculum; otherwise, the Graduate School would be closed down. Daugherty complied, but the Jesuit Superior General later pressured the university to merge the Graduate School into the College in 1907. In 1905, Daugherty's health began to deteriorate, and in August of that year, he resigned the presidency, and was succeeded by David Hillhouse Buel. Overall, he was one of the most well-liked presidents of the university in that era. == Later years == After leaving Georgetown, he was sent to Fordham University as spiritual father, where his health recovered and he again took up teaching.
