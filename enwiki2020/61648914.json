    "text": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py (born 1984) is a French Canadian white nationalist, former neuroscience researcher, and alt-right political commentator. Gari\u00e9py hosts the YouTube channel The Public Space where he calls for the creation of a white ethnostate, pushes antisemitic messages, and advocates for the genetic superiority of white people. The Anti-Defamation League lists The Public Space among \"White Supremacist Channels\". Gari\u00e9py has been described as a \"standard bearer of the alt-right.\" == Personal life == Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py was raised in Saint-Sophie, Qu\u00e9bec and has been married three times. Gari\u00e9py and his third wife separated in July 2015. In December 2015, his wife gave birth to his first son. In the ensuing custody case, his wife accused Gari\u00e9py of \"emotional abuse\" and of \"threatening to abduct their child to his native Canada.\" Gari\u00e9py's wife was given custody, to which Gari\u00e9py appealed. The appellate court judge ordered Gari\u00e9py to undergo a psychological evaluation which resulted in Gari\u00e9py being \"very bright, intellectually\", while also showing a \"lack of insight and impulse control\". During the custody case, Gari\u00e9py started a relationship with a 19-year old mestizo autistic woman from Texas, and eventually convinced her to drive to North Carolina to be with him and attempted to get her pregnant. As the parents objected to her daughter's relationship with Gari\u00e9py, a case was filed in which the woman was revealed to have \"the social and mental maturity of a 10- or 11-year-old child\u201d, according to a psychologist. Gari\u00e9py claimed she was pregnant with his child, but this was proven false. Guardianship was consequently transferred to the parents who severed the relationship. In an interview, Gari\u00e9py told The Daily Beast that the current family court system is designed to \"harass men, to harass white, heterosexual males. Right now I\u2019m currently being treated as a criminal by courts that don\u2019t have the power to put me in jail, but they have the power to ruin my life.\" == Scientist == Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py studied biology at the Universit\u00e9 de Montreal. In 2008, the Society for Neuroscience awarded Gari\u00e9py the Next Generation Award. In 2012, he finished a doctoral thesis in French about the neural networks involved in the respiratory rhythm in lampreys. From September 2011 until September 2015, Gari\u00e9py studied social interactions in monkeys at the Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University. Over his scientific career, Gari\u00e9py published 21 research items that were cited 529 times. Gari\u00e9py told The Daily Beast he left Duke University for Canada because \"he'd grown disillusioned with the scientific community.\" Gari\u00e9py explained his departure from academia on Facebook: \"Academia is a weird thing; it is populated with very intelligent, motivated and brilliant people, who are operating in a system that is simply defective to the point of impeding on the very ability of these individuals to engage in a true search for knowledge. In this sense, I am leaving research academia for the same reason that I joined it 12 years ago: in search for a better way to satisfy my hunger for a scientific understanding of the world.\" Daily Beast author Kelly Weill, however, suggests Gari\u00e9py left Duke University as his legal status in the US came under question during divorce proceedings from his third wife. In 2014, Gari\u00e9py received $25,000 from the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to start the nonprofit organization NEURO.tv which was dedicated to education on science and philosophy via YouTube. Asked whether he felt any regrets for having taken money from a sex offender, Gari\u00e9py said: \"I'd cash a check sent straight from the devil if it could allow me to advance science or science education [...] I did know about the earlier conviction of Epstein when I accepted the money. I didn't know of the most recent allegations though, which are worse than I thought. In any case, I do not regret taking the money. Evil people are not just evil.\" In 2019, Gari\u00e9py published The revolutionary phenotype which is influenced by The selfish gene (1976) and The extended phenotype (1982) by Richard Dawkins. In it, Gari\u00e9py builds on the RNA-world hypothesis to introduce his own theory of how life emerged four billion years ago and how genetic code has developed since then. Gari\u00e9py argues that the combination of artificial intelligence and gene editing might lead to the emergence of a new life form that could potentially be controlled by machines. In October 2014, Gari\u00e9py requested another round of funding from Epstein for The revolutionary phenotype to which Epstein did not respond. == Political commentator == Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py made his first public appearance on episode 157 of the podcast Drunken Peasants in 2015.. In 2017, Gari\u00e9py joined the YouTube channel Warski Live as co-host. At Warski Live, Gari\u00e9py introduced topics like scientific racism by discussing ethnic differences with guests like Richard B. Spencer, Millennial Woes, Andrew Anglin and Sargon of Akkad. At Warski Live, Gari\u00e9py gained notoriety among the alt-right as a moderator of the so-called \"YouTube Bloodsports\" where two or more mainly right-wing guests engage in often highly abusive discussions on politics. After a falling out with his co- host, Andy Warski, in April 2018, Gari\u00e9py founded his own YouTube channel \"The Public Space\". The channel has, among many others, featured white nationalists and alt-right figures like Richard B. Spencer, David Duke, Mike Peinovich and Greg Johnson. == Selected works == * == References == == External links == * Jean-Francois Gari\u00e9py at ResearchGate * Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py at Duke University Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Alt-right Category:Alt-right writers Category:Antisemitism in Canada Category:Canadian eugenicists Category:Canadian neuroscientists Category:Canadian white nationalists Category:Canadian white supremacists Category:Canadian YouTubers Category:Far-right politics in Canada Category:Male critics of feminism Category:Race and intelligence controversy Category:Scientific racism Category:YouTube controversies ",
