    "text": "Evoluci\u00f3n Ciudadana or simply Evoluci\u00f3n , is an Argentine political coalition founded by Martin Lousteau in the City of Buenos Aires. ==History== It was founded in 2015 as Organized Citizen Energy, or simply ECO, to compete against Horacio Rodriguez Larreta in the 2015 City of Buenos Aires elections. The coalition was made up of Public Trust, Radical Civic Union, Civic Coalition ARI, Socialist Party and the Authentic Socialist Party. In 2017 ECO was renamed Evolution, and now it is only made up of the UCR (led by Lousteau) and the PS (led by Roy Cortina), because Elisa Carri\u00f3 (Civic Coalition) and Oca\u00f1a (Public Trust) joined to Vamos Juntos. The coalition ran in the legislative elections of 2017, winning three seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Evoluci\u00f3n integrates the \"Radical Evolution\" bloc, in the Chamber of Deputies of Argentina. ==References== Category:Political parties established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in Argentina ",
