    "text": "The Bruce\u2013Mahoney Trophy The Bruce\u2013Mahoney Trophy is a trophy awarded annually to the winner of an annual sports competition series between Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory and St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco, California. The rivalry began with a Thanksgiving day football game in 1892. The two Catholic high schools are longtime cross-town rivals. The trophy was inaugurated in 1947 and is named in honor of Bill Bruce and Jerry Mahoney, each an alumnus exclusively representing one of the schools, both of whom were killed in World War II. The two schools play against each other in football, basketball, and baseball. In the latter two sports, where the teams play more than one game, only the first game counts towards winning the trophy. The trophy goes to the school that wins in two out of three sports. St. Ignatius has won the trophy a total of 51 times and Sacred Heart Cathedral has won the trophy 21 times through 2018\u20132019.\"The Bruce-Mahoney Trophy.\" St. Ignatius College Preparatory, San Francisco, CA.
