Most settlements are therefore concentrated in oases along the Saoura valley and its tributaries. An aquifer under the Erg Er Raoui supports the main exception, Tabelbala. Natural resources include coal deposits in the north around Bechar and Kenadsa and copper in the south in Djebel Ben Tagine. The oases' traditional economic basis was agriculture, notably growing date palms and grain. The inhabitants of several oases, notably Igli, Ouakda, Lahmar and Boukais, speak Berber languages, while the rest speak Arabic; in one oasis, Tabelbala, a Songhay language, Korandje, continues to be spoken. Many of the oases had significant populations of haratin or shurfa. There are notable zaouias, traditional religious schools, at Kenadsa and Kerzaz. The region also supported a substantial mainly Arab pastoralist nomadic population, notably the Doui- Menia, Ouled Djerir, Ghenanma, Chaamba, and Reguibat; some of these still remain nomadic, but most have settled in the oases. Trans-Saharan trade routes passing through this region played an important role in its economy in pre- modern times, but have at present been superseded. A small tourism industry exists, focused particularly on Taghit. B\u00e9char, whose growth from a minor village began only in the early 20th century, has become the principal urban and administrative centre. The region has a distinctive musical scene influenced by sub-Saharan African rhythms, whose best known representative is the Gnawi singer Hasna El Becharia. Another locally well-known group is El Sed, from Kenadsa. Disagreements between Morocco and Algeria over their mutual border in this province and Tindouf led to conflict after Algeria's independence, the so-called Sand War. ==Administrative divisions== The province is made up of 12 districts and 21 municipalities. The districts are: # Abadla # B\u00e9char # B\u00e9ni Abb\u00e8s # B\u00e9ni Ounif # El Ouata # Igli # K\u00e9nadsa # Kerzaz # Lahmar # Ouled Khode\u00efr # Tabelbala # Taghit The municipalities are: # Abadla # B\u00e9char # Beni Abbes # Beni Ikhlef # Beni Ounif # Boukais # El Ouata # Erg Ferradj # Igli # Kenadsa # Kerzaz # Ksabi # Lahmar # Mechraa Houari Boumedienne # Meridja # Mogheul # Ouled Khoudir # Tabelbala # Taghit # Tamtert # Timoudi ==References== Category:Provinces of Algeria ",
