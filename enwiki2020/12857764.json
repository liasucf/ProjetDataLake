    "text": "Aquilaria malaccensis is a species of plant in the Thymelaeaceae family. It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. It is threatened by habitat loss.Barden, Angela (2000) Heart of the Matter: Agarwood Use and Trade and CITES Implementation for Aquilaria malaccensis TRAFFIC International, Cambridge, The World List of Threatened Trees (Oldfield et al., 1998) listed Iran as one of the countries with a population of A. malaccensis, but an exploratory 2002 CITES review confirmed that Iran has no record of the species. As a result Iran is no longer considered as habitat for or producer of agarwood.-PC14 -09-02-02-A2.pdf page 47 ==Economics== Aquilaria malaccensis is the major sourceNg, L.T., Chang Y.S. and Kadir, A.A.

The resin is produced by the tree in response to infection by a parasitic ascomycetous mould, Phaeoacremonium parasitica,formerly Phialophora parasitica Crous, P. W. et al.

Due to large-scale logging operations, many forested areas where A. malaccensis was once abundant have been destroyed. === Conservation === Despite its endangerment, A. malaccensis is highly adaptable and can perform well in areas contaminated by pollution. Due to this, conservation plans have been set in place to raise agarwood in contaminated areas as well as homestead gardens. ==References== malaccensis Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Critically endangered flora of Asia Category:Plants described in 1783 Category:Symbols of Tripura ",
