It is adjacent to Weston-on-Trent and near Chellaston, very close to the border with Leicestershire. On the north bank of the River Trent, about a mile from the river on rising ground, it is out of its flood plain. The Trent and Mersey Canal runs between the village and the river. All Saints\u2019 Church is Celtic.

Under this charter \u00c6\u00feelr\u00e6d gave his minister, Morcar, a number of rights that made him free from tax and enabled his own rule within the manor.Charter of \u00c6thelred, The Great Council, 1009, accessible at Derby records This manor came under the control of the King again following Morcar being murdered in 1015 and the lands were later given to \u00c6lfgar, the Earl of Mercia, but he lost this at the Norman Conquest. Aston is in the Domesday book where it is mentioned as an outlying farm of Weston-on-Trent and listed amongst the lands given to Henry de FerrersDomesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p. 749 by the King. The land given to HenryHenry de Ferrers held a considerable number of manors including a massive number in Nottinghamshire given to him by the King. These included obviously Aston on Trent, but also included Barrow upon Trent, Breaston, Chellaston, Etwall, Hungry Bentley, Markeaton, Normanton, Spondon and Swarkestone included of land that was valued at eight shillings. The name is of Anglo-Saxon descent ('ton' an Old English suffix meaning farm). Being in the east, the name literally means 'East Farm'. The 'On-Trent' suffix of both Aston and nearby villages simply means they are near the river Trent. Shardlow and Great Wilne were included in the parish of Aston-on-Trent until 1838, when Shardlow constructed its own church. ==Notable residents== General Sir Drury-Lowe was born here and William Darwin Fox was born nearby. Edward Holden, Joseph Greaves and James Sutton were High Sheriffs of Derbyshire.
