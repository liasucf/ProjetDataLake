    "text": "thumbnail The Italian Society of Silviculture and Forest Ecology (, or SISEF), established in 1995, is a non-profit cultural association promoting the diffusion of scientific forest culture in Italy, and all over the world. ==Mission== SISEF mission is to promote researches on: * structure, functionality and sustainable management of forest ecosystems * forest habitat, forest biodiversity and genetics * dendro-ecology, silviculture, wood production and technology, forest harvesting * landscape, forest ecosystem services right SISEF aims also to promote * Coordination, strengthening and networking of forest research * Forest education SISEF supports communication among its members interested in studying forest science and forestry issues, covering all aspects of an interdisciplinary science, including biology, ecology, silviculture, wood production, climate change, environmental and socio-economy aspects. SISEF is accredited by ANVUR, the Italian National Agency for the evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes; and is a member of AISSA, the Italian Association of Scientific Agriculture Societies. SISEF's headquarters is in Viterbo, Italy, at the Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, of Tuscia University. ==Members== All the Italian and foreign researchers interested in the activities carried out by the Society can be members of SISEF. The SISEF members elect every two years five members of the Board, one Secretary and one President. Three auditor board members are also elected for supervising the SISEF budgeting. An annual fee is due by the SISEF members. Currently, SISEF has about 260 members. ==Board== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Years !! President !! Secretary !! Members of Board !!

The journal encompasses a broad range of research aspects concerning forest science: forest ecology, biodiversity/genetics and ecophysiology, silviculture, forest inventory and planning, forest protection and monitoring, forest harvesting, landscape ecology, forest history, wood technology. iForest is freely and universally accessible online. It has been selected for coverage by Thomson Reuters Web of Science (Impact Factor 2013 JCR: 1.150) and SCOPUS. Forest@ is an Open Access, peer-reviewed online journal published in Italian. It aims at disseminating scientific articles, short communications, technical reports, review papers about forest and environmental sciences. ==References== ==External links== * Sisef.org * Sisef.org * Sisefcongressi.org * Sisef.it Category:Forestry in Italy Category:Forest conservation organizations Category:Scientific societies based in Italy Category:Viterbo ",
