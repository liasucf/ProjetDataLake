Upon the independence of Pakistan, it was introduced and adopted as the national motto by the country's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It is inscribed in Urdu at the base of the state emblem. The emblem itself is an adaptation of four components: wreath, crescent, star and scroll, with all components in the shield bounded by the wreath of the Jasmine flower, and the crescent and star crest depicted at the top. ==Origin== The origin of the motto is derived from the country's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Jinnah related it to his personal example of life, and instilled a message to the youth of his time, as well as for Pakistan's future generations. Four months after the emergence of Pakistan on world's map December 28, 1947 Jinnah said: > \"We are going through fire: the sunshine has yet to come. But I have no > doubt that with Unity, Faith and Discipline we will compare with any nation > of the world. Are you prepared to undergo the fire? You must make up your > minds now. We must sink individualism and petty jealousies and make up our > minds to serve the people with honesty and faithfulness. We are passing > through a period of fear, danger, and menace. We must have faith, unity and > discipline.\" ;Roman Urdu Transliteration > \u012am\u0101n, Itti\u1e25\u0101d, Na\u1e93m ;In Urdu > ;In English > Faith, Unity and Discipline. Describing Faith, Unity and Discipline Jinnah delivered many addresses, on 23 March 1945 he said: > \"In Pakistan lies our deliverance, defence and honour\u2026In our solidarity, > unity and discipline lie the strength, power and sanction behind us to carry > on this fight successfully. No sacrifice should be considered too great. I > can assure you that there is nothing greater in this world than your own > conscience and, when you appear before God, you can say that you performed > your duty with the highest sense of integrity, honesty and with loyalty and > faithfulness.\" On September 11, 1948 Jinnah gave his last message: > \"The foundations of your state have been laid and it is now for you to build > and build as quickly and as well as you can. Pakistan is proud of her youth, > particularly the students, who are nation builders of tomorrow. They must > fully equip themselves by discipline, education, and training for the > arduous task lying ahead of them. With faith, discipline, unity and selfless > devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve.\" ==Popular connotations== Popular connotations also include: ; in English: * Unity, Faith, Discipline * Unity, Faith and Discipline ; In Urdu Transliteration * Iman, Ittehad, Nazm * Iman, Ittehad, Tanzeem * Iman, Ittehad, Munazam * Ittehad, Yaqeen, Tanzeem * Ittehad, Tanzeem, Yaqeen-e- Mohkam ==See also== * National symbols of Pakistan ==External links== * ==References== Category:National mottos Category:National symbols of Pakistan ",
