It is described by Jeff Benjamin of Billboard as having \"a color and floral theme as the ladies try to conjure and coax a lover into opening up to them like a flower on the verge of blooming\". It offers a more uptempo and choreography-focused than the previous Korean song \"La Vie en Rose\". Jack Wannan of LWOS Life praised the song as \"[an] amazing production\". ==Commercial performance== In South Korea the song peaked at number 18 which making it the group's lowest charting single on the Gaon Digital Chart. On the K-Pop Hot 100 the song peaked at number five making it the group's highest charting song on the chart. On the US World chart the song peaked at number 8 becoming their second top 10 hit. Despite being a Korean single the song was successful in Japan too peaking at number 13 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. ==Music video== The music video for \"Violeta\" was released on April 1, 2019. Directed by Digipedi, the video gives a \"vibrant and nature-themed imagery [...] featuring meadow flowers, glowing prisms, splashing water and more aesthetically pleasing designs\".
