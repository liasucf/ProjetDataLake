The station's volume contains its mezzanine and ticket hall, connected to a single entrance. This is one of the few downtown stations not to have an entrance integrated into another building, and plans for the vacant lot around the station continually surface; the current plan is for a cultural centre, including a school of contemporary dance.Dance School File:\u00c9dicule M\u00e9tro Saint-Laurent.jpg|Bixi bicycle rack at the west entrance ==Architecture and art== The station contains non-figurative tiled murals by noted ceramicist Claude Vermette. ==Origin of the name== The station takes its name from Saint Lawrence Boulevard (in French, boulevard Saint-Laurent), a main thoroughfare of Montreal, opened and named by 1720 as the road joining Montreal to the village of C\u00f4te-Saint-Laurent, now a borough of Montreal. The latter was named for Saint Lawrence, probably by allusion to the Saint Lawrence River. Saint Lawrence Boulevard is considered the dividing line between eastern and western Montreal, and divides addresses between east and west. ==Connecting bus routes== {| align=center class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background: #; font- size:100%; color:#FFFFFF;\"| |- !
