    "text": "In general topology, the pseudo-arc is the simplest nondegenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum. The pseudo-arc is an arc-like homogeneous continuum, and played a central role in the classification of homogeneous planar continua. R.H. Bing proved that, in a certain well-defined sense, most continua in Rn, n \u2265 2, are homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc. == History == In 1920, Bronis\u0142aw Knaster and Kazimierz Kuratowski asked whether a nondegenerate homogeneous continuum in the Euclidean plane R2 must be a Jordan curve. In 1921, Stefan Mazurkiewicz asked whether a nondegenerate continuum in R2 that is homeomorphic to each of its nondegenerate subcontinua must be an arc. In 1922, Knaster discovered the first example of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum K, later named the pseudo-arc, giving a negative answer to a Mazurkiewicz question. In 1948, R.H. Bing proved that Knaster's continuum is homogeneous, i.e. for any two of its points there is a homeomorphism taking one to the other. Yet also in 1948, Edwin Moise showed that Knaster's continuum is homeomorphic to each of its non-degenerate subcontinua. Due to its resemblance to the fundamental property of the arc, namely, being homeomorphic to all its nondegenerate subcontinua, Moise called his example M a pseudo-arc. Bing's construction is a modification of Moise's construction of M, which he had first heard described in a lecture. In 1951, Bing proved that all hereditarily indecomposable arc-like continua are homeomorphic \u2014 this implies that Knaster's K, Moise's M, and Bing's B are all homeomorphic. Bing also proved that the pseudo-arc is typical among the continua in a Euclidean space of dimension at least 2 or an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. Bing and F. Burton Jones constructed a decomposable planar continuum that admits an open map onto the circle, with each point preimage homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc, called the circle of pseudo-arcs. Bing and Jones also showed that it is homogeneous. In 2016 Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen classified all planar homogeneous continua, up to a homeomorphism, as the circle, pseudo-arc and circle of pseudo-arcs. In 2019 Hoehn and Oversteegen showed that the pseudo-arc is topologically the only, other than the arc, hereditarily equivalent planar continuum, thus providing a complete solution to the planar case of Mazurkiewicz's problem from 1921. == Construction == The following construction of the pseudo-arc follows . === Chains === At the heart of the definition of the pseudo-arc is the concept of a chain, which is defined as follows: :A chain is a finite collection of open sets \\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_1,C_2,\\ldots,C_n\\\\} in a metric space such that C_i\\cap C_j e\\emptyset if and only if |i-j|\\le1. The elements of a chain are called its links, and a chain is called an \u03b5-chain if each of its links has diameter less than \u03b5. While being the simplest of the type of spaces listed above, the pseudo-arc is actually very complex. The concept of a chain being crooked (defined below) is what endows the pseudo-arc with its complexity. Informally, it requires a chain to follow a certain recursive zig-zag pattern in another chain. To 'move' from the mth link of the larger chain to the nth, the smaller chain must first move in a crooked manner from the mth link to the (n-1)th link, then in a crooked manner to the (m+1)th link, and then finally to the nth link. More formally: :Let \\mathcal{C} and \\mathcal{D} be chains such that :# each link of \\mathcal{D} is a subset of a link of \\mathcal{C}, and :# for any indices i, j, m, and n with D_i\\cap C_m e\\emptyset, D_j\\cap C_n e\\emptyset, and m, there exist indices k and \\ell with i (or i>k>\\ell>j) and D_k\\subseteq C_{n-1} and D_\\ell\\subseteq C_{m+1}. :Then \\mathcal{D} is crooked in \\mathcal{C}. === Pseudo-arc === For any collection C of sets, let C^{*} denote the union of all of the elements of C. That is, let :C^*=\\bigcup_{S\\in C}S. The pseudo-arc is defined as follows: :Let p and q be distinct points in the plane and \\left\\\\{\\mathcal{C}^{i}\\right\\\\}_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}} be a sequence of chains in the plane such that for each i, :#the first link of \\mathcal{C}^i contains p and the last link contains q, :#the chain \\mathcal{C}^i is a 1/2^i-chain, :#the closure of each link of \\mathcal{C}^{i+1} is a subset of some link of \\mathcal{C}^i, and :#the chain \\mathcal{C}^{i+1} is crooked in \\mathcal{C}^i. :Let ::P=\\bigcap_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\left(\\mathcal{C}^i\\right)^{*}. :Then P is a pseudo-arc. == References == Notes Citations Bibliography * R.H.
