It is located on the south-eastern slopes of Gilf Kebir, 40 m to the south of the Cave of Swimmers.Maria Cristina Tomassetti, Giulio Lucarini, Mohamed A. Hamdan, Andrea Macchia, Giuseppina Mutri, Barbara E. Barich; Preservation and Restoration of the Wadi Sura Caves in the Framework of the Gilf Kebir National Park Egypt, in: International Journal of Conservation Science, Vol.7,October 2016, pp. 913-934. ==Description== The south-west oriented entrance of the cave is 10 m wide and 5 m tall and opens into a large cupoliform formation modeled in the sandstone. The rock paintings of the cave feature a few panels of persons with bows and arrows as well as a herd of bovines. The paintings are dated between 6300 BP and 5500 BP during the African humid period, much different from the present hyper-arid one. Due to bedrock deterioration the sandstone is heavily weathered or fragmented and only a few painted sandstone blocks remain.Restoring rock art in Egypt\u2019s great Gilf Kebir Retrieved 2020/04/20. ==References== Category:Saharan rock art Category:New Valley Governorate Category:Caves of Egypt Category:Archaeological sites in Egypt ",
