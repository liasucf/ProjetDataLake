    "text": "Miau is a realistic novel by Spanish writer Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, released in 1888. It tells a story about a middle-low class family of Madrid in the 19th century. The main character is Ram\u00f3n Villaamil, an ex-employ\u00e9e from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. He lives with his wife do\u00f1a Pura, his sister- in-law Milagros, his daughter Abelarda, his grandson Luis Cadalso, and his detestable son-in-law V\u00edctor Cadalso. V\u00edctor's wife, Luisa Villaamil, who is dead, was the mother of Luis. Miau is the Spanish onomatopoeia for the sound made by cats, but it also stands for: Moralidad, Impuesto progresivo, Aduanas y Unificaci\u00f3n de la deuda (morality, income tax, customs and unification of the debt), the four main ideas of Villaamil to improve the ministry administration.
