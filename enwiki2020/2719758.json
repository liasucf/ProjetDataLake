The station is owned by the Educational Public TV Corporation, a subsidiary of Daystar sister company Word of God Fellowship, Inc. WYDN's studios are located on Sprague Street in Dedham, and it shares transmitter facilities with Concord, New Hampshire-licensed Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXG-TV (channel 21) on Fort Mountain near Epsom, New Hampshire. On cable, WYDN is available on Comcast Xfinity digital channel 295 and on Verizon FiOS channel 25. ==History== The station first signed on the air on May 5, 1999, as an affiliate of Prime Time Christian Broadcasting (now God's Learning Channel) as a straight simulcast of KMLM in Odessa, Texas.http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-990521.html Originally licensed to Worcester, Massachusetts, WYDN operated its analog transmitter atop Asnebumskit Hill in Paxton (a site which is and has been used by Worcester area FM and TV stations since FM pioneer Edwin Howard Armstrong erected the tower in the 1940s) until the June 12, 2009, digital transition; its digital transmitter operated from the WBZ-TV tower in Needham. By the early 2000s, the station switched to Daystar after it was acquired by its Word of God Fellowship, Inc. licensing subsidiary, and Daystar immediately pushed for successful must-carry carriage from local cable providers. WYDN sold its frequency rights as part of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s 2017 spectrum incentive auction and reached a channel sharing agreement with Ion Television O&O; WPXG-TV; it began broadcasting from WPXG's transmitter on April 23, 2018. As WPXG's broadcasting radius does not cover Worcester, WYDN changed its city of license to Lowell, Massachusetts. ==Digital television== === Digital channel === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Channel !
