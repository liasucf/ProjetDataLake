It was originally produced by the London-based James Buchanan & Co Ltd founded by James Buchanan. Originally known as House of Commons (after the British House of Commons), its nickname, referring to the black and white labelling, was eventually adopted as the official brand instead.\"A Black & White Scotch Whisky review\", \"Collins Pocket Reference:Whisky\" via www.awa.dk. Article retrieved 2006-11-07. The brand's motif (featuring a black Scottish Terrier and a white West Highland White Terrier) was conceived by James Buchanan himself during the 1890s.\"Our Brands: Black & White\" , Diageo corporate website (diageo.com).

Fleischmann Distilling Corp., 390 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. 1968) when a brewing company started manufacturing beer under the brand name \"Black and White\". After a series of mergers and acquisitions involving Dewar's (1915), Distillers Company, and Guinness (forming United Distillers), the brand is now owned by Diageo. It claims to be the most successful in France, Venezuela, and Brazil. At present, the brand is sold only outside the United Kingdom. ==In popular culture== *In Cheers season 6 episode 5 \u201cThe Crane Mutiny\u201c, Frasier orders a scotch, and Woody pours him a Black & White on the rocks. * A bottle is seen on a table in a bar somewhere in the Congo in Tarzan Escapes (1936). *Dick Diver, the main character in F.
