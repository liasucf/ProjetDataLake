It was broken up and ceased to exist after 1996 other than as a consumer electronics brand specializing in disk recordable media for CD and DVD drives, flash memory, computer accessories and other electronics. == History and evolution == MRX V Memorex magnetic tape Established in 1961 in Silicon Valley, Memorex started by selling computer tapes, then added other media such as disk packs. The company then expanded into disk drives and other peripheral equipment for IBM mainframes. During the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Memorex was worldwide one of the largest independent suppliers of disk drives and communications controllers to users of IBM-compatible mainframes, as well as media for computer uses and consumers. Memorex brand Mini-Disc Memorex entered the consumer media business in 1971 and started the ad campaign, first with its \"shattering glass\" advertisements and then with a series of legendary television commercials featuring Ella Fitzgerald. In the commercials, she would sing a note that shattered a glass while being recorded to a Memorex audio cassette. The tape was played back and the recording also broke the glass, asking \"Is it live, or is it Memorex?\" This would become the company slogan which was used in a series of advertisements released through 1970s and 1980s. In 1982, Memorex was bought by Burroughs. Over the next six years, Burroughs and its successor Unisys shut down, sold off or spun out the various parts of Memorex. The computer media, communications and IBM end user sales and service organization were spun out as Memorex International. In 1988, Memorex International acquired the Telex Corporation becoming Memorex Telex NV, a corporation based in the Netherlands, which survived as an entity until the middle 1990s.\"SEC Filing for MEMOREX TELEX N.V.
