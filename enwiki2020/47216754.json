The courthouse has functioned as the seat of Pennington County government since it was built in 1922. Architecture firm W.E. Halse and Company designed the building in the Beaux-Arts style. The three-story building is built from Indiana limestone and has terra cotta trim. The two-story front entrance is divided into sections by four pairs of Ionic columns; three large arched windows decorated with muntin and topped by keystones decorate the three main sections. The entrance, located at what would be the bottom of the middle window, features iron grilles on its windows and transom and is topped by a cartouche. A frieze with ornamental medallions and a dentillated cornice surround the building above its second story. . The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 28, 1976. ==References== Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota Category:County courthouses in South Dakota Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in South Dakota Category:Government buildings completed in 1922 Category:Buildings and structures in Pennington County, South Dakota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pennington County, South Dakota ",
