    "text": "AtariWriter is a word processor for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers published by Atari, Inc. as a 16KB cartridge in 1982. It replaced the Atari Word Processor, which shipped on a copy protected disk, required 48KB, and was incompatible with the XL computers. ==Features== AtariWriter includes automatic word wrap, full-screen editing, dual-column printing, search and replace, undo, block editing and a print preview feature that allows users to view a printable page by scrolling across the screen. Printing attributes are set directly into the document using control characters. This allows direct changes to formatting such as margins, spacing, justification, etc. AtariWriter has only one menu, the main menu, for creating and editing documents, file directory, file management and printing. The cartridge only has built-in printer drivers for Atari printers. Printer drivers for other printers were not available from Atari. However, third-party sources and driver kits were made available.Antic Vol.5 No.2 I/O Board - Printer Drivers - June 1986 Furr estimates that he sold 10,000 disk-based driver kits through the Atari Program Exchange. ==Development== A replacement for the Atari Word Processor was needed that could run on any of the Atari 8-bit computers, which meant using a cartridge instead of a disk. Cartridges on the Atari normally held 8KB or less of ROM, requiring a smaller program. To fill this need, Atari licensed Text Wizard from William Robinson. Robinson originally distributed Text Wizard through Datasoft, but was able to license it to Atari after his deal with that company expired. Gary Furr was the designer and manager of developing the AtariWriter cartridge, working with product manager Peggy Allen. They wrote the original specifications documents using the original Atari Word Processor on an Atari 800.AtariWriter Designer Sells All , by Gary W. Fu \u00bb Sat, 18 Jan 1997 04:00:00, I sat down at my Atari 800 using the original Atari Word Processor to design the specifications for the AtariWriter cartridge word processor. ==Reception== Furr believes that 800,000 cartridges were sold over the product's lifetime. The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the software an overall A rating. The book stated that it \"heralds a new era in word processing\" for Atari 8-bit owners, and \"a good reason in itself to purchase an Atari\". It praised AtariWriter's ease of use and print preview, and concluded that the software was \"a must for every serious writer and Atari owner.\" ==Legacy== *AtariWriter Plus - disk only.
