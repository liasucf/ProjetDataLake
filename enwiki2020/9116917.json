    "text": "\"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\" is a single by the British band Tears for Fears. It was the band's eleventh single release, and as a live re-recording of a song from their second LP Songs from the Big Chair, it effectively served as that album's fifth single. It was Tears for Fears' ninth UK Top 40 hit (peaking at #23). The song also reached the Top 10 in Ireland and peaked at #28 in New Zealand. The song was written by Roland Orzabal who had originally planned to offer it to British musician Robert Wyatt to record, though it was later decided that Tears for Fears would record the song themselves for their album Songs from the Big Chair. Additionally, a cover of Robert Wyatt's \"Sea Song\" served as the single's B-side. The album version of \"I Believe\" is dedicated to Wyatt in the liner notes. Roland Orzabal has confirmed the song is about Primal Therapy, particularly in the last line (which includes references to \"a newborn scream\" and \"the shaping of a life\"). It was the first Tears for Fears release on which the band itself is listed as producer. Although the single was not released in the United States, the re-recording of the song was done in the midst of the band's 1985 American tour. In the course of the song, Orzabal shouts \"William!\" prior to a saxophone solo. The shout was directed to Tears for Fears' touring saxophonist of the time, Will Gregory, best known today as the keyboardist, producer, and composer of the electronic music duo Goldfrapp. The music video for the song, featuring a shirtless Orzabal (as seen on the single's picture sleeve), was filmed in an aircraft hangar in Seattle, Washington. It was again directed by Nigel Dick. ==Track listings== ===7\": Mercury / IDEA11 (UK)=== # \"I Believe (A Soulful Re- Recording)\" (4:35) # \"Sea Song\" (3:52) ===2x7\": Mercury / IDEA1111 (UK)=== # \"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\" (4:35) # \"Sea Song\" (3:52) # \"I Believe (Album Version)\" (4:37) # \"Shout (Dub Version)\" (6:45) ===10\": Mercury / IDEA1110 (UK)=== # \"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\" (4:35) # \"I Believe (Album Version)\" (4:37) # \"Sea Song\" (3:52) ===12\": Mercury / IDEA1112 (UK)=== # \"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\" (4:35) # \"Shout (Dub Version)\" (6:45) # \"Sea Song\" (3:52) # \"Shout (U.S. Remix)\" (8:00) ==Credits and personnel== Tears for Fears *Roland Orzabal \u2013 lead vocals, grand piano,Tears for Fears - Songs from the Big Chair Liner Notes. guitar *Curt Smith \u2013 backing vocals, triangle, bass guitar *Ian Stanley \u2013 keyboards *Manny Elias \u2013 drums Additional personnel *Will Gregory \u2013 saxophone ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tears for Fears songs Category:1985 singles Category:Music videos directed by Nigel Dick Category:Songs written by Roland Orzabal Category:1985 songs Category:Phonogram Records singles Category:Mercury Records singles ",
