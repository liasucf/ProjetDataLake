VVS can only represent the students in the Flemish community of Belgium due to the historically grown federalisation of the country. For the French Community of Belgium there is a separate student union (FEF). VVS is a member of the European Students' Union. ==See also== * Education in Flanders * Education in Belgium ==External links== * Category:Student organisations in Belgium ",
