In 2013, he warned that it could incite violence and split society in France: \"This is the way a violent society develops. Society has lost its capacity of integration and especially its ability to blend differences in a common project.\" He insisted that as long as the government is not listening to French citizens, this could lead to more violence. ==See also== * Catholic Church in France * List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of France ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops of Paris Category:Archbishops of Tours Category:Auxiliary bishops of Paris Category:Cardinals created by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Institut Catholique de Paris alumni Category:French cardinals Category:Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV alumni Category:Members of the Congregation for Bishops Category:Members of the Congregation for the Clergy Category:Members of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches Category:Members of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre Category:People from Paris Category:Anti-same-sex-marriage activists ",
