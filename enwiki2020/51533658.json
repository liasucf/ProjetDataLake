    "text": "J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus (16 August 1852 \u2013 11 March 1915) was a Hungarian journalist and councillor, who served as Mayor (1896\u20131897), then Lord Mayor of Budapest (1897\u20131906). He was also a Member of Parliament from 1910 until his death. ==Early life== He was born into a Transdanubian bourgeois family in Szombathely on 16 August 1852, as the third child of J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus, Sr. (1822\u20131873), who worked as a miller at the local gristmill, owned by Prince F\u00fcl\u00f6p Batthy\u00e1ny. His mother was Anna Roz\u00e1lia Horv\u00e1t (1823\u20131916), a sister of jurist and politician Boldizs\u00e1r Horv\u00e1t, who served as Minister of Justice between 1867 and 1871, in the cabinet of Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy. His parents married on 25 November 1846 in Szombathely. J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus had six siblings, including politician Istv\u00e1n M\u00e1rkus (1847\u20131880), poet Mikl\u00f3s M\u00e1rkus (1849\u20131882) and actress Em\u00edlia M\u00e1rkus (1860\u20131949). When the mill burned down after an accident, the extended family moved to Boldizs\u00e1r Horv\u00e1t. After the early death of their father in 1873, the smaller M\u00e1rkus children were raised by Horv\u00e1t in Budapest, who retired from politics by then. J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus finished his elementary and secondary studies in his birthplace. He attended the Faculty of Law of the University of Pest (today E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, ELTE). After graduation, he got a job in the Ministry of Justice, when his uncle still held the position of minister. Decades later Ferenc Harrer pointedly noted in his memoir (Egy magyar polg\u00e1r \u00e9lete, \"The Life of a Hungarian Bourgeois\") that M\u00e1rkus could thank his professional career merely because of his family relationships. He added that M\u00e1rkus \"was lack of knowledge and diligence\". In contrast, other contemporaries argued that M\u00e1rkus had \"classical education, brilliant oratorical skills and extraordinary working capacity\". M\u00e1rkus married to a Hungarian noblewoman Janka Feigler (1858\u20131931) in 1877. They had two children, author and civil servant Jen\u0151 (born 1879) and pianist Lily (born 1888) who was the wife of painter and graphic Lajos Sz. Gyenes (1890\u20131971). ==Early career== M\u00e1rkus soon continued his career as a journalist. He was an author of the progressive Reform daily newspaper, before joining as a columnist responsible for Budapest affairs to the Nemzeti H\u00edrlap, edited by Istv\u00e1n Toldy, in 1873. In that capacity, M\u00e1rkus began increasingly interested in politics and administration of Budapest. Due to the encouragement of his uncle, he took a draftsman traineeship at the Budapest City Hall in 1875. After a few months, he was appointed assistant clerk by Mayor K\u00e1roly Kamermayer in 1876, thus M\u00e1rkus became a direct employee to the mayor. In 1879, he was appointed notary at the city council's meetings. He played a major role in the establishment of the Elevator House and several other warehouses in the early 1880s, as a result he was awarded the Crowned Gold Cross of Merit by King Francis Joseph in 1884. Following this success, he was promoted to Chief Notary of Budapest on 1 April 1885. He was elected a councillor to the Municipal Local Board of the General Assembly of Budapest five years later, on 1 April 1890, he was the youngest person who held the dignity during that time. In that capacity, he chaired the Finance and Economy Department. Following the death of the incumbent office-holder Guszt\u00e1v Alk\u00e9r, M\u00e1rkus was elected Second Deputy Mayor by the General Assembly on 21 February 1894. As the youngest councillor, he gained 231 of the 279 votes. Mayor Kamermayer cited M\u00e1rkus' \"irreproachable character, unparalleled intellectual ability and professionalism [...]\" when his protegee took the office. Shortly thereafter M\u00e1rkus led a 25-member delegation to Turin, where freedom fighter and statesman Lajos Kossuth died after spending his last years in exile on 20 March 1894. M\u00e1rkus personally arranged for the repatriation of his corpse. Amid a sensitive political climate, Kossuth was buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery following a huge and ceremonious funeral procession on 1 April 1894. Having regard to the monarch Francis Joseph and the Austrian counterpart, the Hungarian cabinet did not represent officially itself at the event. On behalf of the city administration, M\u00e1rkus actively involved in the organization of the funeral. Kamermayer also had to stay away from the ceremony, thus Budapest was represented by First Deputy Mayor K\u00e1roly Gerl\u00f3czy at the highest level, who gave a speech too. M\u00e1rkus took part in the establishment of a new administrative structure in Budapest, which increased the importance of district offices (called prefectures during that time). Formerly, he was a co- author, alongside Kamermayer, of a draft (\"Memoir concerning the market halls\"), which described the plan of development of a network of market halls in the 1890s. The most impressive piece of this project was the Great Market Hall, which was completed in 1897, when M\u00e1rkus already occupied the mayoral seat. In May 1895, along with Jen\u0151 R\u00e1kosi and Count J\u00f3zsef Majl\u00e1th, he was a founding member of the National Association (), which set the objective of improve social conditions for workers, and ethnic reconciliation to counteract socialist and nationalist conflicts and protests countrywide. M\u00e1rkus' political influence gradually increased in parallel with Kamermayer's deteriorating health condition. Throughout the 1896 millennium celebrations, lasted from 2 May to 31 October, which commemorated the anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, M\u00e1rkus personally managed the program of events on behalf of the city administration and maintained contact with the B\u00e1nffy government. In many banquets and ceremonies, he represented Budapest. His activity was acknowledged by Francis Joseph, who awarded a title of royal counselor to M\u00e1rkus after the events. ==Mayor of Budapest== J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus in 1896 In October 1896, Kamermayer announced his retirement and resigned from his position of mayor after 23-year term. He considered the relatively young M\u00e1rkus as his trusted successor, despite the fact that Gerl\u00f3czy held the office of First Deputy Mayor since the unification of the city in 1873. According to the first mayor's will, M\u00e1rkus was elected by the General Assembly as the next Mayor of Budapest, receiving 244 votes, while his opponent, the elderly Gerl\u00f3czy gained only 110 votes. The election of M\u00e1rkus as Mayor marked a generational change within the city administration (Gerl\u00f3czy retired from politics at the end of 1897). Ferenc Harrer argued that M\u00e1rkus became favorite of the urban population owing to his \"bohemian nature, powerful presence, but especially singing talent.\" Harrer, who was critical against the city administration, added that M\u00e1rkus' \"adaptability guided among an emerging political class, which bursted into the place of the dying patriarchy, and they considered [M\u00e1rkus] as perfect executive of their plans and aspirations\". M\u00e1rkus took his office on 25 November 1896. After taking the oath, he gave an inaugural speech, where he promised that the city administration will be respect the government's supervision and inspection rights, however he personally will prevent any effort to unauthorized influence and intentions, which fell outside the scope of the municipality law, and, especially, which sought to diminish the city's autonomy. In his speech, M\u00e1rkus emphasized the need for reform of administrative structure, and also promised the establishment of new departments. During that time, a lot of administrative scope concentrated in the hands of the Mayor of Budapest (for instance, even civil registration of births) which provided a \"water-headed\" characteristics to the city administration. As a result, M\u00e1rkus was determined to adopt decentralization laws. At the time of his 11-month term as Mayor of Budapest, M\u00e1rkus began intensively to reorganize the office of city prosecution, the engineering office and the district agencies. However his proposals were discussed by the General Assembly only in 1899 due intentions from the Ministry of the Interior. However M\u00e1rkus could manage to implement some corrections: few minor administrative cases (e.g. tax collection) were assigned to the lower-ranking committees and councils of the districts. He established the separate Transport Department too. ==Lord Mayor of Budapest== After spending 23 and a half years in office, Lord Mayor K\u00e1roly R\u00e1th died on 30 July 1897. The position remained vacant for several months due to an intense election struggle. According to the city unification law (Statute XXXVI of 1872), the General Assembly had to elect the next Lord Mayor among the three candidates nominated by countersignature of Francis Joseph after consultations with the Ministry of the Interior. M\u00e1rkus was elected as Lord Mayor on 25 October 1897 with 311 of 339 votes. His two opponents, J\u00e1nos Ludvigh, President of the Administrative Court and P\u00e9ter R\u00e1th, Director of Kassa-Oderbergi Railway received just 28 votes jointly. Harrer published an urban legend in his memoir which suggested that M\u00e1rkus was actually nominated by Wilhelm II, German Emperor to the position, when visited the millennium celebrations in 1896. As Lord Mayor, M\u00e1rkus represented his predecessor's role perception, maintaining a broker relationship between the national government and the city administration. Enjoying the confidence of both sides, his election also demonstrated the basically good relations between the two sides then. In comparison to R\u00e1th, M\u00e1rkus tried to enforce the office's audit function by adopting a more ambitious approach, but that did not lead to conflict regarding Budapest's autonomy. J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus (left) with sport shooter S\u00e1ri Soml\u00f3 and his sister, actress Em\u00edlia M\u00e1rkus during an international shooting competition in Pestszentl\u0151rinc in May 1905 According to the contemporary press, the general public in Budapest considered M\u00e1rkus' election as waste of an agile and energetic career, since the position of Lord Mayor was associated with limitied and more passive powers. M\u00e1rkus put the emphasis on the balance of interests and rarely came into conflict with the national cabinet. A journalist of the Pesti H\u00edrlap argued that the Lord Mayor showed his forceful behavior only against employees, which vanished during negotiations with equal partners. Nevertheless, M\u00e1rkus had social prestige in the Hungarian public life. Francis Joseph granted him lifetime membership in the House of Magnates on 21 April 1898. M\u00e1rkus was also awarded Knight Cross of the Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold on 20 November 1898. He was a member of the Memorial Committee for Empress Elisabeth of Austria, who was assassinated on 10 September 1898. He also received 2nd Class of the Order of the Crown (Prussia), Knight Cross of the Order of the Crown (Romania) and the 2nd Class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus of the Russian Empire. As a member of the House of Magnates, M\u00e1rkus was active in the legislative and evaluation committees. He participated in the work of several social organizations; he served as a member of the Directorate of the Railway Society of Budapest and functioned as Chairperson of the Home of Private Officials. In 1900, he organized among the members of the General Assembly a fundraising for the deceased civil servants' widows and orphans, called M\u00e1rkus Fund after him. On 28 October 1903, M\u00e1rkus was re-elected as Lord Mayor of Budapest. By then the previous balanced relationship disintegrated between the Hungarian government and the city administration, in addition to economic downturn. Following the 1905 parliamentary election, a major constitutional crisis broke out when Francis Joseph appointed G\u00e9za Fej\u00e9rv\u00e1ry as Prime Minister, ignoring the election results which saw a massive victory of the opposition Party of Independence and '48. Along with others, the Budapest administration declared that the Fej\u00e9rv\u00e1ry ministry was unconstitutional, and participated in the passive resistance against it. Accordingly, the General Assembly decided not to provide the collected taxes to the central budget, and also authorized Mayor J\u00e1nos Halmos to deny to execute the government decrees. M\u00e1rkus and his narrow circle disagreed with the resistance, thereafter the Minister of the Interior J\u00f3zsef Krist\u00f3ffy declared void the General Assembly's decision. Lord Mayor M\u00e1rkus became an unpopular figure within the city administration. He was unable to mediate between the two parties, as a result he submitted his resignation on 17 February 1906, along with Mayor J\u00e1nos Halmos. On behalf of the General Assembly, he was farewelled by G\u00e9za Pol\u00f3nyi (a member of the Second Wekerle cabinet one month later), who said M\u00e1rkus \"remained a constitutionalist and patriot even in difficult times, who chose the respect for constitution against the high and dignified office in a risky situation.\" After his resignation, M\u00e1rkus was granted Commander with Star of the Order of Franz Joseph by the eponymous monarch. ==Member of Parliament== M\u00e1rkus first appeared as an ordinary councillor in the General Assembly on 24 February 1906. When Francis Joseph intended to appoint a royal commissioner (Budapest Police Chief B\u00e9la Rudnay) to lead the resistant city administration, M\u00e1rkus argued that the monarch should also respect the Hungarian laws and constitutionalism. He proposed that the General Assembly should declare the appointment of Rudnay as unconstitutional and invalid. His proposal was accepted by the administrative body without changes. M\u00e1rkus' funeral in March 1915 After his resignation, M\u00e1rkus did not retire, but entered politics at national level. He ran as a candidate of the National Constitution Party to represent Erzs\u00e9betv\u00e1ros (today 7th district of Budapest) in the 1906 parliamentary election, but did not obtain a mandate, defeated by B\u00e9la Barab\u00e1s, an influential member of the Party of Independence and '48. Nevertheless M\u00e1rkus was elected Member of Parliament for Erzs\u00e9betv\u00e1ros four years later in the 1910 parliamentary election, defeating incumbent MP K\u00e1roly E\u00f6tv\u00f6s and industrialist M\u00f3r L\u00e1nyi. M\u00e1rkus joined the National Party of Work parliamentary group. He was appointed a member of the Committee of Public Administration and the Financial Committee at the inaugural session of the House of Representatives. J\u00f3zsef M\u00e1rkus made his last public appearance on 17 November 1913. He died on 11 March 1915 after a lengthy illness at the Pajor Sanatorium in Budapest. His coffin was laid in repose in the St. Elizabeth Church of Erzs\u00e9betv\u00e1ros, before being transferred by a solemn funeral procession to the Kerepesi Cemetery. He was farewelled by then-mayor Istv\u00e1n B\u00e1rczy during the event. He said M\u00e1rkus' \"operation was permeated by a Hungarian democratic patriotic sentiment, a humanist liberal thought, and a versatile knowledge, which covered every field of urban management [...]\". ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1852 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Hungarian journalists Category:Mayors of Budapest Category:Lord Mayors of Budapest Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary Category:National Constitution Party politicians Category:National Party of Work politicians Category:People from Szombathely Category:E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University alumni ",
