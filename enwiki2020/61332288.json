Oracabissa ran into a gale that damaged her masts and caused a leak. She arrived at Charleston around 9 October and crossed the bar on 16 October. On 17 October 1797 a French privateer believed to be Vortitude (or Vertitude or Fortitude), commanded by a Captain Jourdain and belonging to Cape Francois, captured and burnt Oracabessa within the bar of Charleston Harbour, in violation of the United States's neutrality. Governor Charles Pinckney forwarded to President John Adams affidavits about the incident. Pinckney stated that he had dispatched the cutter to the scene, but that by the time she arrived Oracabessa had burnt and the privateer had fled.Founders Online: To John Adams from Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, 22 October 1797.United States Congress (1851), Appendix, p.3277-8. Lloyd's List (LL) reported on 15 December 1797 that a French privateer had burnt Orracabeza, Storey, master, off Charleston.
