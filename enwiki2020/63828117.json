Matthew England of CBR, meanwhile, ranks it as number eight on their list of 5 Manga That Need An Anime Adaptation (& 5 That You Didn't Know Already Have One). == References == Category:Media Factory manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Seinen manga Category:Surreal comedy anime and manga Category:Yonkoma ",
