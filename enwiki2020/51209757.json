    "text": "Bunsen Is a Beast is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. It revolves around a small eccentric monster named Bunsen who begins attending a middle school that previously only admitted humans. In spite of prejudice against beasts, Bunsen befriends a human boy named Mikey Munroe and his homeschooled companion, Darcy. Together, Bunsen and his friends attempt to navigate through school life while outsmarting a student named Amanda who wants to rid society of Bunsen's kind. The show is based on a drawing of a monster and a boy that Hartman created in 2009. He originally considered writing a picture book featuring the characters, but decided against going forward with the idea until an executive from Nickelodeon saw the drawing and encouraged him to develop the concept into a television program. Prominent themes highlighted in the series include the positive aspects of social integration and the celebration of different cultures. Bunsen Is a Beast was Hartman's fourth and final animated series produced for Nickelodeon before his departure with the network before moving to Sony Pictures Animation to plan any direct-to-video sequels, after The Fairly OddParents (2001\u20132017), Danny Phantom (2004\u20132007), and T.U.F.F. Puppy (2010\u20132015). The first season, consisting of twenty-six episodes, was ordered by Nickelodeon in December 2015. The series had two runs on two different networks; Nickelodeon from January 16 to November 20, 2017, then Nicktoons from December 18, 2017 to February 10, 2018. ==Premise== Bunsen Is a Beast centers around a blue monster named Bunsen, the first beast to attend Muckledunk Middle School. Mikey Munroe, his human friend, helps him navigate through school, as he feels the pressure to prove that monsters can coexist peacefully without eating and harming others. Episodes typically focus on Bunsen learning how to complete human tasks and discovering a human tradition. Mikey also learns more about the monster world, meeting new creatures whenever he visits Bunsen's home. However, a girl named Amanda Killman believes Bunsen is dangerous and wants to destroy him so that his kind will suffer from extinction. Bunsen and Mikey must outwit Amanda whenever she comes up with a new scheme, occasionally with the help of their friend, Darcy. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Bunsen Beast (voiced by Jeremy Rowley) \u2013 A beast who becomes friends with Mikey and is the first beast to become a student in a human school.

Mikey, who stands in the way of this, has become her enemy, although she has a secret crush on him, as hinted in several episodes where she has made comments on him such as praising his tan and shorts. She likes boys in gym shorts, men in tanks and uniform, and her toys Princess Sassafrass and Queen Elizabear.

According to an article published in Variety, he kept the drawing in his office at Nickelodeon until a network executive noticed it and asked him to pitch the concept as a television show. The message that \"no matter who you are, you can always find a place to fit in\" inspired the show's underlying theme of embracing integration. When asked in an interview with Heidi MacDonald's Comics Beat if the show could be interpreted as a metaphor for \"accepting and befriending refugees,\" Hartman mentioned that the social commentary was \"a little bit\" intentional. Animation began about a year before the show premiered. === Cancellation === Butch Hartman announced the show's cancellation after a single season in a 2018 YouTube video in which he announced he had left Nickelodeon. The show is Hartman's shortest running series. == Episodes == == Broadcast == A sneak peek of Bunsen Is a Beast was first shown at Comic-Con in 2016. The series has aired on YTV in Canada on June 3, 2017. The series premiered on Israel on June 4, 2017, Nickelodeon in Australia and New Zealand on June 5, 2017. The series premiered on Greece on July 15, 2017 and Nicktoons in the United Kingdom on September 4, 2017. == Reception == === Critical === The show received mixed to positive reviews overall by critics. Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times praised Bunsen Is a Beast in his review, likening it to \"an early Hanna- Barbera cartoon with the engine of Tex Avery at his eye-popping extreme\" and commending its message about embracing outsiders as \"particularly timely.\" Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series 3 out of 5 stars; saying that, \"This series has an admirable premise that's illustrated by a surprising friendship, but the show's more irritating elements can overshadow its better points.\" But added that, \"kids will like the show's over-the-top situations and Bunsen's bizarre reactions to them.\" The show currently holds a 4.9/10 on IMDb and a 5.9/10 on TV.com, indicating mixed reviews.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6433606/http://www.tv.com/shows/bunsen- is-a-beast/ === Accolades === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Award !Category !Nominee !Result ! |- |2018 |45th Annie Awards |Outstanding Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Television / Broadcast Production |Jeremy Rowley as \"Bunsen\" | | align=center| |} ==References== ==External links== * * on Nickelodeon Category:Nicktoons Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2010s American school television series Category:2010s Nickelodeon original programming Category:2017 American television series debuts Category:2017 animated television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American flash animated television series Category:Animated television series about children Category:English-language television shows Category:Middle school television series Category:Television series created by Butch Hartman Category:Nickelodeon original programming Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming ",
