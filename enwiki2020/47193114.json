    "text": "The Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBDRS) is a 45-question screening measure, completed by either parents or teachers, designed to identify symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder in children and adolescents. For each question, the respondent is asked to indicate the degree to which a statement describes the child\u2019s behavior. Response options include \u201cnot at all\u201d, \u201cjust a little\u201d, \u201cpretty much\u201d, and \u201cvery much\u201d. For any question they do not know the answer to, respondents are asked to write \u201cDK\u201d for \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. The behavioral rating scale takes 5\u201310 minutes to complete and is designed for use with children ages 5 and up. The scores of the scale have been shown to be reliable and valid across multiple different study samples. == See also == *Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder *Oppositional defiant disorder *Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology *EffectiveChildTherapy.Org information on rule-breaking, defiance, and acting out == References == ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) Rating Scale Category:Psychiatric diagnosis Category:Childhood psychiatric disorders Category:Psychiatric instruments: child and adolescent psychiatry ",
