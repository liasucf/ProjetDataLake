    "text": "The Flying Hat Band were an early 1970s Birmingham, England hard rock act that, alongside Judas Priest, ranked as the Midlands' favourites to succeed. Despite not having released an album, the band proved a successful club act and eventually went on to support Deep Purple on one of their European tours. The band folded in April 1974 following Glenn Tipton's departure to become the second guitarist in Judas Priest, who at the time had just signed their first record deal with Gull Records. Peter \"Mars\" Cowling joined Canadian rocker Pat Travers in 1975, and was part of Travers' band for several years. Trevor Foster joined folk rock group The Albion Band and Little Johnny England. ==Personnel== ;Final lineup * Glenn Tipton - vocals, guitar * Peter \"Mars\" Cowling - bass guitar (d. 2018) * Steve Palmer - drums ;Former members * Trevor Foster - drums * Andy Wheeler - bass * Pete Hughes - vocals *Steve Burton - vocals * Frank Walker - bass guitar *Dave Shelton - bass and guitars == Discography == Signed to Vertigo, in 1973 the trio recorded a studio album which was never released.
