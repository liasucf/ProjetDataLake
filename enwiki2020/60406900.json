    "text": "The Mercedes-Benz N1300 is a light commercial vehicle designed and manufactured by the Spanish subsidiary IMOSA (Industrias del Motor SA) based in Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the Basque Country, north of Spain. Its body had its roots in the DKW F1000 L (or DKW-IMOSA F1000) van (designed by Fissore) in 1963, in three different versions: cargo van, passenger van with windows, and chassis with cab . The maximum load admitted was 1,000 kilos, plus the driver, and the maximum speed in the best conditions was 100 km/h. The DKW F1000 was the modern successor of the DKW F89 L, and in 1975 it was renamed the Mercedes-Benz N1000 and later the N1300. In 1987, it was succeeded by the Mercedes-Benz MB100.www.euskomedia.org Mercedes-Benz Espa\u00f1a - Factor\u00eda de Vitoria - Consultado el 11/12/2012 == References == N1300 N1000 N1000 Category:Vans ",
