In both seasons he helped Mississippi State to a conference championship, but 1966 may have been a breakout year. He led the team runs with 31, hits with 39, and his .333 batting average. That same year he was also named to The Sporting News All- American. In 1997, the university inducted Unser into the school's hall of fame.https://msfame.com/inductees/delbert-unser/ ==Pro career== The Minnesota Twins had selected Unser in the June draft in 1965, but Unser did not sign with them, nor did he sign with the Pittsburgh Pirates after they selected him in the winter draft in 1966. However, Unser was drafted in the first round of the June 1966 draft by the Washington Senators and signed with them, reporting to their Double-A team, the York White Roses of the Eastern League. Unser struggled his first season, in the minors, batting only .220. However, management in Washington saw something in Unser, and in 1968, he made the leap from double-A to the majors. At the age of 23, on April 10, 1968, Unser made his MLB debut, against the team that had drafted him a year earlier, the Minnesota Twins. Unser got a hit in his major league debut.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=unser-001del Unser played for the Washington Senators from 1968 to 1971.

Unser stayed with Washington when the team made its move to Texas to become the Rangers. However, he did not play a game for the franchise in its new city. The Rangers dealt Unser to the Cleveland Indians as part of a seven player deal in 1972. Unser was traded again after one season in Cleveland, this time to the Philadelphia Phillies along with minor league third baseman Terry Wedgewood for Oscar Gamble and Roger Freed on December 1, 1972.Durso, Joseph. \"A's Send Epstein to Rangers; Scheinblum, Nelson to Reds,\" The New York Times, Saturday, December 2, 1972.

After the 1974 season, Unser was sent to the New York Mets along with John Stearns and Mac Scarce in exchange for Tug McGraw, Don Hahn and Dave Schneck. He hit .294 for the Mets in 1975, and might have hit .300 that year, but sustained a late- season rib injury which affected his swing. He was hit by a pitch early in the 1976 season and sustained an arm injury, then was traded to the Montreal Expos on July 21. In 1977, he began to be used primarily as a pinch-hitter, and also split his time on the field between the outfield and first base, and in winter of 1978 became a free agent, returning to the Phillies from 1979 to 1982. Unser played a key role in the Phillies' 1980 World Series victory over the Kansas City Royals, getting crucial doubles to drive in runs as a pinch hitter in the late innings of Games 2 and 5. The first cut the Royals' lead from 4-2 to 4\u20133 in the bottom of the 8th inning, and scored the tying run before Mike Schmidt drove in the winning run with a double for a 2-0 Series lead for Philadelphia. In Game 5 in Kansas City and with the series tied at two games apiece, the Phillies were at bat in the top of the ninth and trailing by a score of 3\u20132. After Schmidt led off with a single, Unser again delivered a double to score Schmidt with the tying run. He later scored the go-ahead run on Manny Trillo's single as the Phillies won the game 4-3 to take a 3\u20132 lead in the World Series back to Philadelphia, where they closed it out in the 6th game. Unser played a few more years in Philadelphia after that World Series win.

Though Unser never hit in the pros the way he did in college, he was a star on defense. After he was released by the Phillies, Unser ran a sporting goods store, then returned to baseball as a coach, returning to the city of Philadelphia. Hired in 1983 by Team President Bill Giles to be a roving minor league instructor. When John Felske became the manager in 1985, Unser was offered the role of first base coach and hitting coach and jumped at the chance for the role.
