    "text": "Martin \"Marty\" Wright (born July 15, 1964), better known by the ring name The Boogeyman, is an American retired professional wrestler and aerobics instructor. ==Professional wrestling career== ===World Wrestling Entertainment=== ====Tough Enough and Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004\u20132005)==== Wright first entered the world of professional wrestling to take part in the fourth season of the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced reality television competition Tough Enough. On October 15, 2004, he attended the two- day event in Venice Beach, California, where he was among eight finalists chosen. After surviving the first day of eliminations he admitted that he was actually 40 years old \u2014 five years over the competition's cut off point \u2014 and not 30 as he'd claimed. As a result, he was cut from the competition. Though he had been cut from Tough Enough, WWE officials invited him to come to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for possible training. He trained between January and June 2005, making his OVW debut on June 25, 2005. During a dark match pitting the team of Seth Skyfire and Robert Fury against Robbie Dawber and his partner, Wright entered the ring and squashed all three men, no-selling the offense of Skyfire in the process. He then announced that he was \"The Boogeyman\" before leaving the building. The Boogeyman gimmick further evolved into a \"monster\" face who would appear when another wrestler said his name and attack him, while not selling any offense he received. ====SmackDown! (2005\u20132007)==== On the July 11, 2005 episode of Raw, horror movie-style vignettes began airing to promote the debut of \"The Boogeyman\". After a few weeks, the vignettes were moved from Raw to SmackDown!, but the planned debut was delayed when Wright hyperextended both knees and needed time to recover. He made his debut on the October 14, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, being brought in by network executive Palmer Cannon as part of a \"new talent initiative\". The storyline referenced to vignettes months ago as promos for a television series on the network called \"The Boogeyman\". The show was cancelled before it could air, but they still had the actor under contract, so he was brought to SmackDown! to wrestle. The Boogeyman then proceeded to recite a modified version of the chant One, two, Freddy's coming for you from the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street before smashing an oversized alarm clock on his own head. For the next few weeks, The Boogeyman appeared in unexpected places backstage (closets, vans, et cetera), reciting different nursery rhymes and holding up clocks before screaming his catchphrase \"I'm The Boogeyman and I'm comin' to get'cha!\" and laughing maniacally. At Survivor Series, The Boogeyman helped SmackDown! general manager Theodore Long defeat his Raw counterpart, Eric Bischoff. He made his official in-ring debut on the December 2 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Simon Dean in a squash. During this match, he took a handful of live worms from his pocket and stuffed them into his mouth. Over the next few weeks, Boogeyman's opponents were generally \"flattened\" in the ring, left with worms in their mouths and/or spit on their faces. His official pay-per-view debut was at December's Armageddon when he came to the ring to confront Vito and Nunzio who were dressed as Santa Claus and an elf. Boogeyman's first major feud occurred with John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) and his \"fixer\" Jillian Hall, and it began when he stalked the duo throughout a number of shows. During the January 6 episode of SmackDown!, he caught a fleeing Hall and shoved worms down the back of her skirt. On the January 13 taping of SmackDown!, during a Piper's Pit segment, The Boogeyman not only sniffed a \"growth\" on Jillian's face, but then licked it, bit it off and ate it. The Boogeyman faced JBL at the Royal Rumble, winning in under two minutes. After defeating The Dicks in a handicap match on the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, The Boogeyman dumped a bucket of worms on the announce table, frightening special guest commentators Booker T and his wife Sharmell. The Boogeyman subsequently began to stalk Booker T and Sharmell over the next few weeks. He and Booker T were set to face off on the March 18 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, but the match was canceled due to Booker T faking a knee injury to escape competition. The feud eventually culminated at WrestleMania 22, with The Boogeyman defeating Booker T and Sharmell in a handicap match. During the match, Boogeyman kissed Sharmell with a mouthful of worms. The match had to be cut short because of a biceps tear at a house show. To explain his absence to rehab his injury, Booker T and Sharmell obtained a restraining order against The Boogeyman on the April 7 episode of SmackDown!. As SummerSlam approached, The Boogeyman began appearing in TV spots to promote the event. Vignettes also began airing advertising his return to SmackDown!. On September 20, WWE.com reported that Wright had been released from the company, however, on October 6, WWE.com announced that Wright had re-signed with the company and would be sent to be trained at Booker T and Stevie Ray's wrestling school in Houston, Texas. Wright returned on the October 27 episode of SmackDown!, attacking and spitting worms into the faces of The Miz and Kristal Marshall. During the feud he again terrorized and stalked his opponents, and eventually ended The Miz's undefeated streak at the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 17. Wright then feuded with Finlay, who ended The Boogeyman's undefeated streak when Hornswoggle interfered. On the February 2 edition of SmackDown! during a match against Chris Benoit for the WWE United States Championship, Boogeyman abducted Hornswoggle, distracting Finlay and giving Benoit a chance to win the match with a roll-up. On the February 16 edition of SmackDown! The Boogeyman appeared with a little person of his own, Little Boogeyman, who was portrayed by an actor named Chris Hollyfield. Chris also previously had played Lil Booker T. His purpose was to counteract Hornswoggle, who was proving a problem in one-on-one matches with Finlay. The Boogeyman and the Little Boogeyman lost to Finlay and Hornswoggle in a mixed tag team match at No Way Out. The team lost a rematch the following week on SmackDown!; Little Boogeyman was pinned by Finlay, after Wright had chased away Hornswoggle. On OVW's 400th anniversary show, The Boogeyman made an appearance, losing to Ryan Wilson in a tables match. The Boogeyman returned to in ring action when teamed with Kane during his feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. This also marked the return of Little Boogeyman. The feud would be short lived as Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman would then start another feud with Finlay and Hornswoggle. Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman were defeated in a mixed tag match by Finlay and Hornswoggle at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIV on June 2. The Boogeyman ended his tenure on SmackDown! with a loss to Mark Henry in a squash match, as part of Henry's new \"Path of Destruction\" gimmick. After that match, Mark Henry then beat up Little Boogeyman who was at ringside, and Henry gave him a body splash, (kayfabe) severely injuring him. ====ECW and departure (2007\u20132009)==== On the June 11 edition of Raw, The Boogeyman was drafted to the ECW brand in the annual WWE draft. The next day he debuted for the brand and defeated Matt Striker, beginning a feud with him. On July 10 in New Orleans, The Boogeyman was a guest during a Striker's Classroom segment, ostensibly to be educated on worms, only to be attacked by Striker's debuting enforcer, Big Daddy V. The Boogeyman was not seen for the next three weeks, finally re-emerging on the July 31 episode \u2014 with a new face paint design and black contact lenses \u2014 to scare Big Daddy V off after he finished a match. Boogeyman was taken out by Big Daddy V from behind after a distraction from Striker a week later. On the August 14 episode of ECW, Boogeyman scored a disqualification victory over ECW Champion John Morrison after Morrison shoved the referee. Boogeyman went on to successfully team with CM Punk at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV on August 18 against Morrison and Big Daddy V. On the August 28 episode of ECW, Boogeyman was one of the participants in the Fatal Four Way match for a shot at Morrison's title; however, CM Punk was the victor. On September 4, on ECW, Boogeyman defeated Matt Striker by disqualification when Big Daddy V interfered, and went on to hit Boogeyman with a ghetto drop on the outside of the ring. On the September 18 episode of ECW, Boogeyman and Big Daddy V finally faced off in their first one-on-one match, which Boogeyman lost. Boogeyman's return to wrestling action was initially delayed due to a torn calf muscle, but it had also been reported that he was having dental surgery done to replace missing teeth. On the October 7 episode of ECW a vignette was aired promoting The Boogeyman's return. Additional vignettes aired for a few weeks after that. On the October 13, 2008 edition of Raw, The Boogeyman made his return, appearing during a segment with Jackass's Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, and Big Dick Johnson ending with The Boogeyman bringing live worms out of a bag and after putting them in his own mouth spat them into the mouth of Pontius. The Boogeyman made his ECW return on the November 25 episode, in a segment with John Morrison and The Miz. He made his return to in ring competition on December 9 against Scott Reed, a local talent, who he defeated with ease. On the December 30 episode of ECW, he lost to John Morrison and The Miz in a No DQ match with Finlay as his partner. On the January 20, 2009 edition of ECW, he defeated Paul Burchill by disqualification, his first victory over a non-enhancement talent since returning to the brand. His last appearance on WWE programming was on the March 3 episode of ECW where he lost in a match against Kane. The next day on March 4, 2009, WWE announced that they had released Wright from his WWE contract. ===Independent circuit (2009\u20132017, 2019)=== After WWE, Wright returned to the Pro Wrestling Alliance using his Boogeyman gimmick. Later, using a new gimmick called Slither, he wrestled at Northeast Wrestling as The Nightcrawler, defeating Jake Manning. Wright made his debut for The Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) at Soul Survivor VI on April 24, 2010. He defeated \"Executioner\" Brian Milonas. During late December 2011 Wright made an appearance on UWD (United Wrestling Destruction) where he defeated newcomer Harry Janes at the special event \"Win Or Lose.\" He returned using his old The Boogeyman gimmick at Cyberstarz event of Millennium Wrestling Federation on February 2012, where he defeated Lukas Sharp. After that, he left the wrestling business for quite some time, before he decided to return on July 9, 2012, where he was available on independent scene bookings. On August 11, 2013, Wright using The Boogeyman gimmick made an appearance for Juggalo Championship Wrestling's Bloodymania 7 teaming with Kongo Kong to face 2 Tuff Tony and a returning Vampiro in a losing effort. On September 3, 2017, as The Boogeyman, he defeated The Horror for All Out Mayhem wrestling. In March 2019 he wrestled the Dreamcather at WWW in a losing effort. In 24 of August he wrestled against Orange Cassidy in Big Time Wrestling and won. ===Return to WWE=== ====Sporadic appearances (2012\u20132019)==== On the December 16, 2012 episode of Raw, Wright returned as The Boogeyman during the Slammy Awards, sneaking up on former rival Booker T. Boogeyman appeared in Halloween themed videos on the WWE YouTube channel in both November 2013 and October 2014. On the December 22, 2014 episode of Raw, Boogeyman appeared in a segment on the WWE App. On January 25, 2015 at Royal Rumble, Boogeyman entered the Royal Rumble match as a surprise entrant at number 7 marking his first WWE in\u2013ring performance in almost six years, but was quickly eliminated by Bray Wyatt. On November 6, it was announced that Wright has signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) with WWE. On January 22, 2018, Boogeyman made an appearance on Raw 25 Years.
