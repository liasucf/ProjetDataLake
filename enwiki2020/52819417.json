Most of the non-winning pieces nominated for the awards were omitted. ==Contents== *\"Introduction\" (Ursula K. Le Guin) *\"Acknowledgements\" (Ursula K. Le Guin) *\"Catch That Zeppelin!\" [Best Short Story winner, 1976] (Fritz Leiber) *\"End Game\" (Joe Haldeman) *\"1975: The Year in Science Fiction, or Let's Hear It for the Decline and Fall of the Science Fiction Empire!\" (Peter Nicholls) *\"Home is the Hangman\" [Best Novella winner, 1976] (Roger Zelazny) *\"Child of All Ages\" [Best Short Story nominee, 1976] (P.

P. J. Stevens in Australian SF News writes \"I shouldn't have to sell you on this volume, you should be up and running to the nearest bookstore to buy a copy of this collection of the best sf for 1975.\"Stevens, P. J. Review in Australian SF News v. 1, no. 6, Dec. 1978, p. 6.
