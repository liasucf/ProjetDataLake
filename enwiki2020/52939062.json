Ilyas Rashidi acquired experience in entertainment journalism through his association with Umer Azad (his older brother) and his daily newspaper Anjum, which had shifted its offices from Delhi to Karachi in 1947. Ilyas had been inspired by Filmfare magazine and thus purchased a children's magazine Monthly Nigar from his friend Ibne Hassan Nigar, and re-branded it as a weekly film magazine. In 1957, the Nigar Awards were founded, as an extension of Nigar (magazine). The magazine has news and feature articles relating to Pakistani cinema and recently it has added Pakistani dramas as well. The magazine includes extensive photography of actors and actresses. ==References== Category:Film magazines Category:Magazines established in 1948 Category:Magazines published in Pakistan Category:Weekly magazines published in Pakistan Category:Mass media in Karachi Category:Urdu-language magazines ",
