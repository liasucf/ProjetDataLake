    "text": "John Mew (born 1928) is a British orthodontist and the creator of \"orthotropics\", an unconventional and controversial method claimed to be able to guide facial growth. The practise of \"mewing\", a form of do-it-yourself oral posture training, is named after him. == Career == Mew practised dentistry for 40 years in Surrey and Kent. He is and visiting professor at Victor Babe\u0219 University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timi\u0219oara, Romania.http://www.stomaeduj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mew.pdf He got life membership of the British Dental Association in 1999. In 2010 the General Dental Council reprimanded Mew for disparaging regular orthodontics in his advertisements. In 2013 Mew received an award at the American Academy of Physiological Medicine and Dentistry. He authored the book The Tropic Premise. == Theories == === Orthotropics === Mew's orthodontic methods have consisted of using palatal expanders, changing the patient's diet, and having the patient push their teeth with the tongue. He views crooked teeth not as being due to a genetic cause, but instead being a symptom of jaws being too small and recessed due to the modern lifestyle. These theories have not received support from mainstream orthodonists, and are considered fringe science. === Mewing === \"Mewing\" is a form of do-it-yourself oral posture training named after John Mew and his son Michael Mew (born 1969). Mewing involves resting the whole of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, breathing only through the nose, keeping the teeth and lips gently closed, chewing food well before swallowing, and swallow chewed food at the back of the mouth without engaging the lip and buccinator muscles. It spread from the Mews' YouTube videos about orthotropics. It was picked up by followers of the \"looksmax\" trend (in which people try to maximise their looks) and became a mainstream internet subject in 2018. Mewing is derived from orthotropics but has taken a direction that is distinct from what the Mews have promoted, in particular orthotropics is intended for children and not as a beauty enhancement for adults. Mewing is not supported by research and is also considered a fringe theory. == Personal life and interests == Aged 18, shortly after the end of the Second World War, Mew learnt to fly a Tiger Moth. He subsequently took up fixed wing gliding and later hang gliding. At 19 Mew he and built his own sports car, fabricating much of it from scratch. Between 1957 and 1967 he was involved in motor racing, moving from Formula Three to Formula One.https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1963/57/brands- hatch Motorsports Magazine 1963 archive article He was one of the last private entrants, entering events all over Europe. In 1963 he twice broke the Formula One club circuit record at Brands Hatch, beating times set by World Champions Jim Clark, and John Surtees.https://twmc.org.uk/profiles/john_mew.html Tunbridge Wells Motor Club Profile In 1958 he was selected for the British Team for the first post-war challenge for the Americas Cup, though he was subsequently unable to participate in the event itself. In 1971 he was selected to crew for John Prentice, captain for the British International 14 dingy racing team in Annapolis, USA, where Britain came second.
