Podhorzer was the CEO of Tempo Beverages, founded and owned \"Neviot\" (mineral water) and is very involved in real estate in the United States and Europe. == Biography == Podhorzer was born in Israel. He is the son of Sarah and the attorney Yehuda Aryeh Podhorzer. Podhorzer is married to Bilha, the daughter of industrialist Moshe Bornstein, the founder and owner of Tempo. After his military service, he studied economics and business administration at Bar-Ilan University and at the same time studied law at the University of Tel Aviv and received his law degree 1972. Toward the end of his studies and upon obtaining his lawyer's license, Podhorzer joined \"Tempo\" Industries Ltd. and served as the company's CEO for nearly 20 years until the early 1990s. At \"Tempo\" Podhorzer led a number of strategic and innovative moves that significantly affected the company and the Israeli food and beverage market in general. Tempo, under Podhorzer's management, was the first to introduce to the Israeli market the PET-bottled soft drinks instead of the glass bottles that were customary at the time by all soft drink companies. In addition, during this period Tempo became \"Tempo Beer Industries Ltd\" after acquisition of the only beer company in Israel. Also during those years, Tempo began producing and marketing Pepsi Cola, which brought about an \"earthquake\" in the beverage market in Israel. Tempo was chosen by the Dutch company \"Heineken\" and became Heineken's representative in Israel. In 1989 \u2013 Podhorzer initiated, established, and privately owned the \"Neviot\" company (mineral water), which within a short time managed to hold 50% of the market shares in Israel. After only three years from its establishment, in 1992, it was issued on the Israeli Stock Exchange. Since then, \"Neviot\" has gained an excellent reputation and is a leading brand, all this due to Podhorzer's reputation and proven management and marketing skills in the food and beverages industry. In 2000 \u2013 Podhorzer added the \"Coca-Cola\" company as a partner, having Coca-Cola acquire 40% of Neviot's stock. Podhorzer continued to serve as the company's chairman of the board. Following this agreement, \"Coca-Cola\" became the distributor for Neviot bottles while \"Neviot\" distributed its own home water containers. \"In 2003 \u2013 Podhorzer sold 45% of Tempo's stock held by him and his wife to other partners in the company. In 2005 \u2013 Podhorzer sold the remaining shares of Neviot to Coca-Cola and left the soft drink industry. That year, he was awarded the Kiryat Shmona City Notable, along with Shlomo Nehama who was the Chairman of the Board of Hapoalim bank at that time and Eli Horowitz, founder and CEO of Teva. During those years, he began to engage in the field of real estate development in Spain and Cyprus, where he established projects for the construction of hundreds of resort units. In the United States and Europe, Podhorzer continues to invest in real estate by \"Podhorzer Holdings Ltd.\" Additional investments are made through his other company investment arm, P.I.M. \u2013 Podhorzer Investment & Management Ltd. P.I.M examines companies that require a \"change of direction\" and invests in them. Podhorzer serves as a member of the executive committee and member of the board of trustees of Bar- Ilan University. Podhorzer lives in Tel Aviv and has four children: Eyal, Dana, Yossi and Yonatan. His son Eyal is the owner of Econergy Systems Ltd., which invests in the solar energy field in Israel and in Europe. == References == Category:Israeli businesspeople ",
