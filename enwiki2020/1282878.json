Archived 2009-10-31. and leader of the Hungarian uprising against the Habsburgs in 1703-11 as the prince () of the Estates Confederated for Liberty of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was also Prince of Transylvania, an Imperial Prince, and a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Today he is considered a national hero in Hungary. His full title was: Franciscus II. Dei Gratia Sacri Romani Imperii & Transylvaniae princeps Rakoczi. Particum Regni Hungariae Dominus & Siculorum Comes, Regni Hungariae Pro Libertate Confoederatorum Statuum necnon Munkacsiensis & Makoviczensis Dux, Perpetuus Comes de Saros; Dominus in Patak, Tokaj, Reg\u00e9cz, Ecsed, Somly\u00f3, Lednicze, Szerencs, Onod. His name is historically also spelled R\u00e1k\u00f3czy, in Hungarian: II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Ferenc, in Slovak: Franti\u0161ek II. R\u00e1koci, in German: Franz II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, in Croatian: Franjo II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czy (Rakoci, Rakoczy), in Romanian: Francisc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi al II-lea, in Serbian \u0424\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446 II \u0420\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0446\u0438. ==Childhood== He was the richest landlord in the Kingdom of Hungary and was the count (comes perpetuus) of the Comitatus Sarossiensis (in Hungarian S\u00e1ros) from 1694 on. He was the third of three children born to Francis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, elected ruling prince of Transylvania, and Ilona Zr\u00ednyi, who was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban of Croatia, and niece of Petar's older brother, Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi. His paternal grandfather George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II and great-grandfather George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi were also Princes of Transylvania. He had a brother, George, who died as a baby before Francis was born, and a sister, Julianna R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, later Countess of Aspremont-Lynden, who was four years older than Francis. His father died when he was four months old. Upon Ferenc I's death, his widow requested guardianship of her children; however, the advisors of Emperor Leopold I insisted that he retain guardianship of both Ferenc and his sister, especially as Francis I had willed this before death. Despite further difficulties, Zr\u00ednyi was able to raise her children, while the Emperor retained legal guardianship. The family lived in the castle of Munk\u00e1cs (today Mukacheve, in Ukraine), S\u00e1rospatak and Reg\u00e9c until 1680, when Ferenc's paternal grandmother, Sofia B\u00e1thory, died. Then, they moved permanently into the castle of Munk\u00e1cs. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi retained strong affection for this place throughout his life. Aside from his mother, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's key educators were Gy\u00f6rgy K\u0151r\u00f6ssy, castellan to the family, and J\u00e1nos Badinyi. ==End of the Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly uprising== The memorial plate of Francis II embedded in the northern wall of the St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia Zr\u00ednyi's second husband, Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly took little interest in R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's education, as he was by then heavily involved in politics. However, the failure of the Turks to capture the Habsburg capital in the Battle of Vienna in 1683 frustrated Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's plans to become King of Upper Hungary. When the Turks began to grow suspicious of his intentions, Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly proposed sending the young R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to Constantinople as a guarantee of his goodwill. But R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's mother opposed this plan, not wishing to be separated from her son. In 1686 Antonio Caraffa besieged their residence, the castle of Munk\u00e1cs. Zr\u00ednyi successfully led the defence of the castle for three years, but capitulated in 1688. The two R\u00e1k\u00f3czi children fell again under the guardianship of Leopold I, and moved to Vienna with their mother. They regained their possessions, but could not leave the city without the Emperor's permission. At the age of 17, the Emperor emancipated R\u00e1k\u00f3czi from his mother, thereby allowing him to own property. His sister Julianna had interceded for him after marrying a powerful Austrian, General Aspremont. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi lived with the Aspremonts until his marriage in September 1694, to 15-year-old Princess Amelia, a daughter of Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried and a descendant of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. The couple moved to the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi castle at S\u00e1rospatak, where R\u00e1k\u00f3czi began to manage his properties. The Treaty of Karlowitz on 26 January 1699, forced Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly and Zr\u00ednyi into exile. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi remained in Vienna under the Emperor's supervision. Relying on the prevalent anti-Habsburg sentiment, remnants of Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's peasant army started a new uprising in the Hegyalja region of Northeastern present-day Hungary, which was part of the property of the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi family. They captured the castles of Tokaj, S\u00e1rospatak and S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely, and asked R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to become their leader, but he was not eager to head what appeared to be a minor peasant rebellion. He quickly returned to Vienna, where he tried his best to clear his name. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi then befriended Count Mikl\u00f3s Bercs\u00e9nyi, whose property at Ungv\u00e1r (today \u0423\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 (Uzhhorod), in Ukraine), lay next to his own. Bercs\u00e9nyi was a highly educated man, the third richest man in the kingdom (after R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and Simon Forg\u00e1ch), and was related to most of the Hungarian aristocracy. ==R\u00e1k\u00f3czi uprising== As the House of Habsburg was on the verge of dying out in Spain, France was looking for allies in its fight against Austrian hegemony. Consequently, they established contact with R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence. An Austrian spy seized this correspondence and brought it to the attention of the Emperor. As a direct result of this, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was arrested on 18 April 1700, and imprisoned in the fortress of Wiener Neustadt (south of Vienna). It became obvious during the preliminary hearings that, just as in the case of his grandfather P\u00e9ter Zr\u00ednyi, the only possible sentence for Ferenc was death. With the aid of his pregnant wife Amelia and the prison commander, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi managed to escape and flee to Poland. Here he met with Bercs\u00e9nyi again, and together they resumed contact with the French court. Three years later, the War of the Spanish Succession caused a large part of the Austrian forces in the Kingdom of Hungary to temporarily leave the country. Taking advantage of the situation, Kuruc forces began a new uprising in Munk\u00e1cs, and R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was asked to head it. He decided to invest his energies in a war of national liberation, and accepted the request. On 15 June 1703, another group of about 3000 armed men headed by Tam\u00e1s Esze joined him near the Polish city of \u0141awoczne. Bercs\u00e9nyi arrived too, with French funds and 600 Polish mercenaries. Gyula Bencz\u00far (1844\u20131920): Capture of Francis II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi in Nagys\u00e1ros Castle (1869) Most of the Hungarian nobility did not support R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's uprising, because they considered it to be no more than a peasant rebellion. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's famous call to the nobility of Szabolcs County seemed to be in vain. He did manage to convince the Hajduk (Hungarian soldiers) (emancipated peasant warriors) to join his forces, so his forces controlled most of Kingdom of Hungary to the east and north of the Danube by late September 1703. He continued by conquering Transdanubia soon after. Since the Austrians had to fight R\u00e1k\u00f3czi on several fronts, they felt obliged to enter negotiations with him. However, the victory of Austrian and British forces against a combined French-Bavarian army in the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704, provided an advantage not only in the War of the Spanish Succession, but also prevented the union of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's forces with their French-Bavarian allies. Statue of Francis II situated outside Hungarian Parliament Building This placed R\u00e1k\u00f3czi into a difficult military and financial situation. French support gradually diminished, and a larger army was needed to occupy the already-won land. Meanwhile, supplying the current army with arms and food was beyond his means. He tried to solve this problem by creating a new copper-based coinage, which was not easily accepted in Hungary as people were used to silver coins. Nevertheless, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi managed to maintain his military advantage for a while \u2013 but after 1706, his army was forced into retreat. A meeting of the Hungarian Diet (consisting of 6 bishops, 36 aristocrats and about 1000 representatives of the lower nobility of 25 counties), held near Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny (N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County) in September 1705, elected R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to be the \"vez\u00e9rl\u0151 fejedelem\" \u2013 (ruling) prince \u2013 of the Confederated Estates of the Kingdom of Hungary, to be assisted by a 24-member Senate. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and the Senate were assigned joint responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, including peace talks. Encouraged by England and the Netherlands, peace talks started again on 27 October 1705 between the Hungarians and the Emperor. Both sides varied their strategy according to the military situation. One stumbling block was the sovereignty over Transylvania \u2013 neither side was prepared to give it up. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's proposed treaty with the French was stalled, so he became convinced that only a declaration of independence would make it acceptable for various powers to negotiate with him. In 1706, his wife (whom he had not seen in 5 years, along with their sons J\u00f3zsef and Gy\u00f6rgy) and his sister were both sent as peace ambassadors, but R\u00e1k\u00f3czi rejected their efforts on behalf of the Emperor. In 1707 during the Great Northern War he was one of the candidates to the throne of Poland, supported by El\u017cbieta Sieniawska. On R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's recommendation, and with Bercs\u00e9nyi's support, another meeting of the Diet held at \u00d3nod (Borsod county) declared the deposition of the House of Habsburg from the Hungarian throne on 13 June 1707. But neither this act, nor the copper currency issued to avoid monetary inflation, were successful. Louis XIV refused to enter into treaties with Prince R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, leaving the Hungarians without allies. There remained the possibility of an alliance with Imperial Russia, but this did not materialize either. At the Battle of Trencs\u00e9n (German: Trentschin, Latin: Trentsinium, Comitatus Trentsiniensis, today Tren\u010d\u00edn in Slovakia), on 3 August 1708 R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's horse stumbled, and he fell to the ground, which knocked him unconscious. The Kuruc forces thought him dead and fled. This defeat was fatal for the uprising. Numerous Kuruc leaders transferred their allegiance to the Emperor, hoping for clemency. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's forces became restricted to the area around Munk\u00e1cs and Szabolcs County. Not trusting the word of J\u00e1nos P\u00e1lffy, who was the Emperor's envoy charged with negotiations with the rebels, the Prince left the Kingdom of Hungary for Poland on 21 February 1711. ==Peace agreement== In R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's absence, S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi was named Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian forces, and quickly negotiated a peace agreement with J\u00e1nos P\u00e1lffy. Under its provisions, 12,000 rebels laid down their arms, handed over their flags and took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor on 1 May 1711 in the fields outside Majt\u00e9ny, in Szatm\u00e1r county. The Peace of Szatm\u00e1r did not treat R\u00e1k\u00f3czi particularly badly. He was assured clemency if he took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor, as well as the freedom to move to Poland if he wanted to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. He did not accept these conditions, doubting the honesty of the Habsburg court, and he did not even recognize the legality of the Peace Treaty, as it had been signed after the death of the Emperor Joseph I on 17 April 1711, which terminated the plenipotential authority of J\u00e1nos P\u00e1lffy. Subsequently, his Hungarian properties, Munk\u00e1cs and its castle, Szentmikl\u00f3s (today Palanok Castle, Mukacheve and Chynadiyovo, Ukraine) and 200 villages were confiscated (and, in 1726, given by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor to Elector-Archbishop Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn who had helped to defeat R\u00e1k\u00f3czi). ==Exile== R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was offered the Polish Crown twice, supported by Tsar Peter I of Russia. He turned the offers down, though, and remained in Poland until 1712, where he was the honored guest of the Polish aristocracy. For a while he lived in Gda\u0144sk under the pseudonym of Count of S\u00e1ros. He left Gda\u0144sk on 16 November 1712, and went to England, where Queen Anne, pressured by the Habsburgs, refused to receive him. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi then crossed the Channel to France, landing in Dieppe on 13 January 1713. On 27 April he handed a memorandum to Louis XIV reminding him of his past services to France and asking him not to forget Hungary during the coming peace negotiations for the War of the Spanish Succession. But neither the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 nor the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714 made any mention of Hungary or R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. No provisions were even made to allow R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's two sons, who were kept under surveillance in Vienna, to rejoin their father. Prince R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, although not recognized officially by France, was much in favour in the French court. But after the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, he decided to accept the invitation of the Ottoman Empire (still at war with the Habsburgs) to move there. He left France in September 1717, with an entourage of 40 people. and landed at Gallipoli on 10 October 1717. He was received with honors, but his desire to head up a separate Christian army to help in the fight against the Habsburgs was not under serious consideration. The memorial house of Francis II in Tekirda\u011f The Ottoman Empire signed the Peace Treaty of Passarowitz with Austria on 21 July 1718. Among its provisions was the refusal of the Turks to extradite the exiled Hungarians. Two years later, the Austrian envoy requested that the exiles be turned over, but the Sultan refused as a matter of honor. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and his entourage were settled in the town of Tekirda\u011f (Rodost\u00f3 in Hungarian), relatively distant from the Ottoman capital, and a large Hungarian colony grew up around this town on the Sea of Marmara. Bercs\u00e9nyi, Count Simon Forg\u00e1ch, Count Antal Esterh\u00e1zy, Count Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00e1ky, Mikl\u00f3s Sibrik, Zsigmond Zay, the two P\u00e1pays, and Colonel \u00c1d\u00e1m J\u00e1vorka were among many who settled there, sharing the sentiment of the writer Kelemen Mikes, who said, \u201cI had no special reason to leave my country, except that I greatly loved the Prince.\u201d The memorial house of Francis II in Ko\u0161ice (a replica of his original house of Tekirda\u011f) R\u00e1k\u00f3czi lived in the Turkish town of Tekirda\u011f for 18 years. He adopted a set routine: rising early, attending daily Mass, writing and reading in the mornings, and carpentry in the afternoons; visited occasionally by his son, Gy\u00f6rgy R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Further military troubles in 1733 in Poland awakened his hopes of a possible return to Hungary, but they were not fulfilled. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was 59 years old when he died on 8 April 1735. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's testament ( will ), dated 27 October 1733, left something to all his family members as well as to his fellow exiles. He left separate letters to be sent to the Sultan and to France\u2019s Ambassador to Constantinople, asking them not to forget about his fellow exiles. His internal organs were buried in the Greek church of Rodosto, while his heart was sent to France. After obtaining the permission of the Turkish authorities, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's body was taken by his faithful chamberlain Kelemen Mikes to Constantinople on 6 July 1735 for burial in Saint-Beno\u00eet (then Jesuit) French church in Galata, where he was buried, according to his last wishes, next to his mother Ilona Zr\u00ednyi. His remains were moved on 29 October 1906 to the St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Kassa, Hungary (today Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia), where he is buried with his mother Ilona and his son.Katalin M\u00e1ria Kincses \u201eWithout Special Ceremony: The Cult of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi - Bringing Home the Prince's Mortal Remains\u201d ==Timeline== Histoire des R\u00e9volutions de Hongrie, The Hague, by Jean Neaulme, 1739 *Early life ** 27 March 1676 \u2013 R\u00e1k\u00f3czi is born. ** 26 January 1699 \u2013 Treaty of Karlowitz forces Emmeric Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly and Ilona Zr\u00ednyi into exile. ** 11 February 1701 \u2013 Negotiations begin with Louis XIV concerning the Hungarian struggle for independence. ** February, 1701 \u2013 Correspondence is seized by an Austrian spy.

In the 1950s, the first two words, Cum Deo (i.e., \"With God\"), were removed for ideological reasons; in 1989, they were restored. When, after 1945, the great Millennium Monument on Heroes' Square was purged of statues of the Habsburg kings of Hungary, the best Hungarian sculptor of the period, Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl, made a new statue of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi instead of King Lip\u00f3t II. It was erected in 1953 together with a relief on the base depicting the meeting of R\u00e1k\u00f3czy and Tam\u00e1s Esze. ===Places and institutions=== Nearly every Hungarian city has commemorated R\u00e1k\u00f3czi by naming streets and squares after him. There are 11 R\u00e1k\u00f3czi streets and 3 R\u00e1k\u00f3czi squares in Budapest alone (see: Public place names of Budapest), including one of the most prominent avenues, named (\"R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Avenue\"), forming the boundary between Districts VII and VIII.Budapest City Atlas, Szarvas- Dimap, Budapest, 2011, The street was named after him on 28 October 1906 when his remains were brought back to Hungary from Turkey and a long funeral march went along the street to the Eastern Railway Station. , in District VIII, was also named after him in 1874. A bridge on the Danube at Budapest is named R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Bridge after him. In Hungary two villages bear the name of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. R\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva in J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County was established in 1883 on the former estate of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi where the Prince had a hunting lodge. The neighbouring R\u00e1k\u00f3czi\u00fajfalu became an independent village in 1950 (before that it was part of R\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva). The village of Zavadka, today in Ukraine next to the Veretski Pass (Hungarian: Vereckei-h\u00e1g\u00f3) where R\u00e1k\u00f3czi arrived at Hungary in the beginning of the uprising in 1703 and where he said goodbye to his followers in 1711 going into exile was renamed R\u00e1k\u00f3czisz\u00e1ll\u00e1s in 1889. The neighbouring village of Podpol\u00f3c (today Pidpolozzya) where R\u00e1k\u00f3czi spent a night in 1703 was renamed that year Vez\u00e9rsz\u00e1ll\u00e1s. After 1918 the two villages got back their former names. The Mount Bovcar (today Vovcharskiy Vrh in present-day Ukraine and the neighbouring Bovcar Spring was named by the local Rusyn people after R\u00e1k\u00f3czi who drank from the spring on 18 February 1711. means \"the Tsar was here\" in Rusyn language. The library of Borsod-Aba\u00faj- Zempl\u00e9n county in Miskolc (II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Ferenc Megyei K\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r) has also been named after him. The house in which he lived has been transformed into R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Museum, Tekirda\u011f, open to the visitors every day except Mondays. ===Banknotes=== R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's portrait can be found on Hungarian banknotes. Before it had been withdrawn from circulation, it was on the 50-forint note. Since then it has been transferred to the 500-forint note. ===R\u00e1k\u00f3czi March=== A well-known patriotic tune of the 18\u201319th century (composer unknown), is also named after R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, as it was reputed to be his favourite, although actually it was composed only in the 1730s. Hector Berlioz orchestrated the piece, and it was also used by Franz Liszt as the basis of his Hungarian Rhapsody No.15. The R\u00e1k\u00f3czy March remains a popular piece of Hungarian state and military celebrations. ==Postage stamps== * Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was honored by Hungary by issuing a set of five stamps in his honor on 8 April 1935.colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/6955-Hungary/year/1935 * Another stamp was issued in his honor on 1 January 1943 in the \u201cCharacters and Relics of Hungarian History\u201d series.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/179986-Ferenc_II_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi_1676-1735-Characters_and_Relics_of_Hungarian_History- Hungary * A series of seven commemorative stamps of paintings was issued on 27 March 1976 on account of 300th birth anniversary of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi.colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/6955-Hungary/year/1976/page/2 ==See also== * Executioner's Bastion * R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's sculpture in Ko\u0161ice * Count of St. Germain theorized as son ==References== ==External links== * His life * A detailed timeline of his rebellion * His picture on the Hungarian 500 forint banknote Category:1676 births Category:1735 deaths Category:Monarchs of Transylvania Category:People from Trebi\u0161ov District Francis 02 Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:17th-century Hungarian people Category:18th-century Hungarian people Category:Rebellious princes ",
