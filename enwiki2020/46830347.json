On September 20, 2017, Qin was appointed as Deputy Director of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (minister-level). The move was seen as a demotion, taking place only days after it was revealed that Qin did not even get elected as an ordinary delegate to the 19th Party Congress. It also decisively broke with the mold of a long line of Communist Youth League chiefs who soared to higher office later on in their careers. == References == Category:Politicians from Xinxiang Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Tsinghua University alumni Category:Chongqing University alumni Category:Political office-holders in Sichuan Category:Political office-holders in Tibet Category:First Secretaries of the Communist Youth League of China Category:Alternate members of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ",
