    "text": "San Lawrenz () is a village on the island of Gozo, Malta. Its name is derived from Lawrence of Rome who is the patron saint for the village. It has a population of 748, as of March 2014. The Dwejra nature reserve is administratively part of the town. Prominently in the reserve is the Fungus Rock, and formerly also the Azure Window landmark before its collapse in 2017. ==Overview== It is built on a plain surrounded by three hills, G\u0127ammar, Gelmus and Ta' Dbie\u0121i. The last mentioned, Ta' Dbie\u0121i, rises 195 metres above sea level and is Gozo's highest point. In the limits of San Lawrenz, there is also the bay of Dwejra, known for its strange geological faults. The village has retained its traditional and rural lifestyle. San Lawrenz is one of the two Gozitan localities that have taken their name from that of their patron saint. The other is the nearby hamlet of Santa Lu\u010bija, Gozo. San Lawrenz was established a parish on 15 March 1893. Before this date, the area was known as Ta' \u010aangura. Most probably the site derived its name from a local family name or nickname. The date of origin of this area is not known. However the name Ta' \u010aangura can be dated back to before the Siege of Gozo, that is, before July 1551. Until San Lawrenz was declared a parish in 1893, it formed part of the neighbourhood of G\u0127arb. However, as time went by the people of San Lawrenz started to form a separate community and as a result they wanted their own church. The foundation stone for this new church was laid and consecrated by the Bishop Peter Pace on 21 November 1886. The relic of Saint Lawrence was placed under this stone. Every villager participated in the building of the church. The village feast of San Lawrenz is celebrated each year, in the warmest part of the Summer, namely around the first week of August. There is one restaurant, the village shop and the local bar (run by the local football club to raise funds). With a population of 748 people (as of March 2014), it is the second least populated village on Gozo and third least in all of the Maltese Islands. The village's football team is called St. Lawrence Spurs. ==Main roads== *Pjazza San Lawrenz (St. Lawrence Square) *Triq Ta' \u010aangura (Ciangura Road) *Triq id-Duluri (Our Lady of Sorrows Road) *Triq il-\u0120ebla tal- \u0120eneral (Fungus Rock Road) *Triq il-Wile\u0121 (Open Fields Street) *Triq San Lawrenz (St. Lawrence Road) ===Other streets=== *Da\u0127let Pawluzzu (Pauluzzu Lane) *Pjazza Dwejra (Dwejra Square) *Trejqa l-10 ta' Awissu (10 August Path) *Trejqet il-Wil\u0121a Ta' \u0120idrin (Gidrin's Open Field Path) *Triq Dun Salv Portelli (Fr.
