    "text": "The Mystkowski family \u2013 was one of several noble families using the Clan Jastrz\u0119biec coat-of-arms during the time of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the Commonwealth's breakup, the family's nobility status has been officially recognized until the early 1900s, when too many family members either emigrated or were lost in World War I to continue the line in Poland. The Russian Revolution of 1917 erased all hopes of regaining the territory and the heirs to the title now live in the United States. They belonged to the poorer part of the noble class ruling the town of Mystki-Rzym, a small town near Bia\u0142ystok. Unfortunately for the Polish nobility, during both world wars and the conquest of Poland by the USSR, most documents and other artifacts were destroyed. ==Family members of note== * Kazimierz Wies\u0142aw Mystkowski (born 13 April 1958) Computer engineer, formerly married to Princess Marie of Romania, youngest daughter of former King Michael I of Romania and Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma. * Ignacy Mystkowski (born 4 February 1826 - died 13 May 1863) Lieutenant-Colonel with the Polish National Government revolutionary forces during the January Uprising.
