    "text": "John Kay, 1799. Claud Irvine Boswell, Lord Balmuto (1742 \u2013 22 July 1824) was a Scottish judge. ==Biography== Boswell was born in 1742. His father, John Boswell of Balmuto, who was the younger brother of James Boswell of Auchinleck, and a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, died when Claud was an infant. At the age of six he was sent to Mr Barclay's school at Dalkeith. After finishing his education at the University of Edinburgh, he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 2 August 1766. On 25 March 1780 he was appointed sheriff depute of Fife and Kinross, and, after serving this office for 19 years was, upon the death of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, appointed an lord of session, and took his seat upon the bench with the title of Lord Balmuto on 21 June 1799. After nearly 23 years of judicial work he resigned in January 1822, and was succeeded by William Erskine, Lord Kinneder. The death, under his own roof, of his kinsman, Sir Alexander Boswell, from the effects of a wound received by him in the duel with James Stuart of Dunearn, gave him a shock from which he never entirely recovered. He died at Balmuto on 22 July 1824, in his 83rd year. He was a robust and athletic man, with black hair and beetling eyebrows. His manner was boisterous and his temper passionate. Though fond of joking, a habit he sometimes indulged in on the bench, he was not particularly keen in the perception of wit in others. In 1783 he married Anne Irvine, who, by the death of her brother and grandfather, became the heiress of Kingcussie. They had two daughters and a son. Two etchings of him will be found in Kay, Nos. 262 and 300. ==References== ==External links== Category:1742 births Category:1824 deaths Category:18th-century Scottish people Category:19th-century Scottish people Category:Clan Boswell Balmuto Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ",
