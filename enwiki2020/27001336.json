In a 2002 festschrift, one of his former students described Rao as \"a man of many interests... cross-cultural and cosmopolitan.... His writings are a blend of Eastern and Western traditions. They are an attempt to bring about, to use his own expression, the sangaman (confluence) of East-West streams of thought. Dr. K. Ramakrishna Rao is to Indian psychology what Dr. S. Radhakrishnan is to Indian philosophy\".Rammohan, V. Gowri (2002). \"K. R. Rao: The man and his mission\". In Rao was profiled in the book Eminent Indian Psychologists: 100 years of Psychology in India (2017).
