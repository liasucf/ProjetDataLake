    "text": "The Presidential Horse Guard Mounted Ceremonial Squadron (), shortened as the Representative Squadron of the Polish Army is a cavalry unit (dressed in the traditions of the uhlans) that is part of the 1st Guards Battalion, Representative Honor Guard Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces. It serves as the travelling mounted escort of the President of Poland, who serves as the Supreme Commander of the Polish Armed Forces. This cavalry unit, raised in 2000, is the successor of the heritage and traditions of the cavalry units of the Polish Land Forces dating from many centuries. Apart from the escort of dignitaries, it also participates in ceremonial military parades, official anniversary celebrations and historical reenactments.http://brepr2.wp.mil.pl/en/49.html ==Brief history and description== Cavalry units existed in the Polish Army for most of the Second World War and even during the early post-war years as purely combat units until 27 January 1947, when the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division was disbanded. That same year, the Representative Squadron of the President of Poland founded to serve the leadership of the Provisional Government of National Unity. It followed the customs of Polish-Lithuanian light cavalry. It was disbanded the following July due to the rise of the creation People's Republic of Poland and the usurpation of power by the Polish United Workers' Party. After the Fall of Nations and the Soviet Union between 1989-1991, there was hope from civil society and military historians that the military would expand to allow Polish cavalry units once again. After a public effort by enthusiasts, including negotiations between the Ministry of National Defense and the Association of Horse Squadrons on 12 November 1996, a Representative Squadron under the auspices of the Land Forces was raised in 2000.https://preprwp.wp.mil.pl/pl/pages/pododdzia-kawaleryjski-2018-04-12-o/ Originally, it was part of the 2nd Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki Brigade of Territorial Defense Forces. From 2005, the unit was transferred to the command of the 3rd Security Battalion of the Land Forces Command in Warsaw. Since 2009, it has been part of the 1st Guards Battalion, Representative Honor Guard Regiment and have been composed of only professional soldiers instead of volunteers.http://www.sprwp.waw.pl/brepr/szwadron.html On 25 June 2007, the Cavalry Squadron began the practice of taking part in state arrival ceremonies at the Presidential Palace for visiting heads of state. Despite the fact that it is officially a reconnaissance unit, it has only representative functions. Members of the squadron are armed with ceremonial sabres and lances with red and black pennant banners. An identification mark and beret pennant was introduced in April 2015.http://wp39.struktury.net/szwadron-kawalerii- dywizyjnej-organizacja-wojenna-ldz3022orgmob37.html ==Gallery== File:Po\u017cegnanie by\u0142ego premiera RP Jana Olszewskiego (9).jpg|The squadron at nighttime File:Polish president with army.PNG|The squadron escorting President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski during the 2007 Armed Forces Day parade.
