    "text": "Pablo Hidalgo (born 12 October 1974) is a Chilean-Canadian creative executive, currently working for Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise and member of the Lucasfilm Story Group. ==Early work== Hidalgo was born in Santiago de Chile and raised in Winnipeg, Canada. In 1987 he became a fan of the role-playing game (RPG) resources published West End Games, the only official source of Star Wars content in the late 1980s and took it upon himself to become knowledgeable of the universe to create better stories for the group of friends he was playing it with. He later used both content from the RPG and ideas he developed for his gaming sessions within official Star Wars media, such as the tracking device used by the Inquisitor and the name of a ship in Star Wars Rebels. He submitted content for West End Games' Star Wars Adventure Journal in 1993. Although rejected because he was not a published author at the time, his correspondence with the company resulted in him being hired as a cartoonist for the magazine by Peter Schweighofer. Since he was now a published author, he was allowed to publish material for the RPG as well as stories in the magazine. During his involvement, he collected the first large- scale database of Star Wars knowledge, parts of which he posted online in 1997 as the \"Star Wars Index\". He also used his extensive knowledge to assist Steve Sansweet with fact-checking the Star Wars Encyclopedia, the first such work published shortly before the release of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. ==Working for Lucasfilm== In January 2000 he was hired by Sansweet at Lucasfilm to build up StarWars.com, the official Star Wars website, as a resource for fans during the then-active filming and launch of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. He then served as Internet Content Manager for Lucas Online, the division of Lucasfilm responsible for maintaining StarWars.com, where he also published multiple comics until 2011. Even though Star Wars canon was not completely error-free at this point due to a previous lack of oversight and he was not in any official capacity employed to help maintain it, Hidalgo was already being consulted to ensure continuity during this time. In 2005, he had a non-speaking cameo role in Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith as a patron of the opera Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker visit. ===Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm=== After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, he approached Kathleen Kennedy about making his consulting role official which led to the creation of the Lucasfilm Story Group (other members include Kiri Hart and Leland Chee), a group of Star Wars experts tasked with maintaining the canon of the franchise after its partial reboot in 2014. Their duties range from fact-checking dialogue, e.g. whether a certain character would really say a certain line or whether it makes sense in the universe's context, to keeping track of names and locations of planets as well as naming unnamed planets, characters and other entities as well as coordinating all stories in development. Sometimes called the Yoda of Lucasfilm or \"the Indiana Jones of Star Wars\", his insider knowledge of Star Wars canon is used by multiple sources to confirm or deny rumors about certain characters, locations or events within the fictional universe. J.J. Abrams admitted that during the production of Star Wars: The Force Awakens he often e-mailed Hidalgo up to three times a day asking him questions about details about the franchise's universe. ==Partial bibliography== Hidalgo is the author of several official reference and guide books about the Star Wars franchise as well as the G.I. Joe and Transformers franchises. * Star Wars Chronicles: The Prequels (with Steve Sansweet) (2005) * G.I. Joe vs. Cobra: The Essential Guide, 1982-2008 (2009) * Transformers Vault: The Complete Transformers Universe Showcasing Rare Collectibles and Memorabilia (2011) * The Essential Reader's Companion (2012) * Star Wars: A New Hero (2014) * Star Wars Rebels: Head to Head (2014) * Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary (2015) * Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy (2016) * Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide (2016) * Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View (2017) * Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary (2017) * Solo: A Star Wars Story: The Official Guide (2018) * Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious (2018) * Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary (2019) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Canadian science fiction writers Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Winnipeg Category:Chilean emigrants to Canada Category:Writers from Santiago Category:Lucasfilm people ",
