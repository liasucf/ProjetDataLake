    "text": "Erice (; ) is a historic town and comune in the province of Trapani in Sicily, southern Italy. ==Geography== The main town of Erice is located on top of Mount Erice, at around above sea level, overlooking the city of Trapani, the low western coast towards Marsala, the dramatic Punta del Saraceno and Capo San Vito to the north-east, and the Aegadian Islands on Sicily's north-western coast. Casa Santa forms part of Erice at the base of Mount Erice, immediately adjacent to Trapani. A cable car joins the upper and lower parts of Erice. The bordering municipalities are Buseto Palizzolo, Paceco, Trapani, Valderice and Custonaci. The hamlets (frazioni) are Ballata, Casa Santa, Crocefissello, Napola, Pizzolungo, Rigaletta, San Cusumano and Torretta. ==History== Tower of the Chiesa Madre (Cathedral). The ancient Greek name of Erice was Eryx ( in Greek), and its foundation was associated with the eponymous Greek hero Eryx. It was not a Greek colony, as the Phoenicians founded it, but was largely Hellenized. It was destroyed in the First Punic War by the Carthaginians, and from then on declined in importance. Eryx was conquered by the Aghlabids in 831 and was renamed as Cebel Hamid (in Western sources Gebel Hamed, meaning Mountain of Hamid). It was ruled by the Arabs until the Norman conquest. In 1167 the Normans renamed it Monte San Giuliano, a name maintained until 1934. ==Main sights== In the northeastern portion of the city there are the remains of ancient Elymian and Phoenician walls (Cyclopean masonry) indicating different stages of settlement and occupation in antiquity. There are two castles that remain in the city: Pepoli Castle, which dates from Saracen times, and the Castello di Venere (\"Venus Castle\"), dating from the Norman period, built on top of the ancient Temple of Venus, where Venus Ericina was worshipped. According to legend, the temple was founded by Aeneas. It was well known throughout the Mediterranean area in the ancient age, and an important cult was celebrated in it. In his book On the Nature of Animals, Aelian writes that animals chosen for sacrifice would voluntarily walk up to the altar to be killed. A cable car (funivia) ran from 2005 to 2017, when it was closed due to a forest fire, from the outskirts of Trapani to the town of Erice. The cablecar was rebuilt and reopened in June 2018. ==Culture== Erice hosts scientific meetings at the Ettore Majorana center, organised by the controversial astrophysicist Antonino Zichichi. There is also an annual workshop on Molecular Gastronomy. == Gallery == File:Church (9524863018).jpg|Erice Cathedral with its bell tower File:Erice - interieur de la Chiesa Matrice.JPG|View inside the Cathedral File:EriceDomRosette.jpg|Rose window of the Cathedral File:Erice mura3.jpg|Cyclopean masonry File:Erice- streets-bjs-3.jpg|Via San Carlo File:San Giuliano church - Erice.jpg|St Julian's Church File:Erice-Castle-bjs-1.jpg|Castle of Balio File:Erice - Castello 03.JPG|The stronghold and Castle of Venere File:Erice-Castle- bjs-2.jpg|Castle of Venere File:Erice-views-bjs-1.jpg|View of monte Cofano File:Erice-views-bjs-2.jpg|Trapani seen from the castle File:Monte Cofano seen from Erice.jpg|Monte Cofano seen from an alley in Erice ==External links== * Panoramic view from Erice castle * Erice Photo Essay Category:Elymians Category:Archaeological sites in Sicily Category:Phoenician colonies in Sicily ",
