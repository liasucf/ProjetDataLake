The hospital has 244 pediatric beds and is affiliated with the University of Michigan Medical School. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults 0-21 throughout Michigan and the surrounding states. The hospital sometimes also treats older adults that require pediatric care. C.S. Mott Children's Hospital also features a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, 1 of 3 in the state. Attached to the children's hospital is the Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital that provides maternal and gynecological care for women. The hospital moved to a newly constructed building in 2011. Although commonly understood to be a physical health complex, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital also includes a youth and adolescent psychiatric ward separate from the rest of the children's hospital. The C. S. Mott Children's and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital employs about 4,000 people and is gradually hiring 500 more now that the hospital expansion is complete. == History == The University of Michigan first established a pediatric program in 1903 when they opened up a 75-bed children's unit. The unit was one of the first dedicated pediatric units' in the nation. In 1965, American businessman and philanthropist C.S. Mott donated $6.5 million to the University of Michigan to help the university build its first children's hospital. The 200 bed hospital served about 3,500 children in its first year of operation. In the late 1980s, the university renovated its pediatric wards to accommodate private patient rooms instead of previous open wards. The new facility for the C. S. Mott Children's and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital, opened in December 2011 following the completion of a $754 million, five-year construction project. It is one of the largest children's hospitals in the United States. The hospital is and consists of a 12-story inpatient wing and a nine-story outpatient wing. There are 348 beds, including 50 maternity rooms and 46 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) rooms. The expansion increases the number of beds at the hospital by 75 percent and makes the hospital the largest of Michigan's three children's hospitals. Every inpatient room is private, in contrast to the old facility, which had mostly double occupancy rooms. The new hospital has 16 operating rooms and two interventional radiology rooms. The first Women's Hospital opened in 1950, while the original C.S. Mott Children's Hospital opened in 1969 and traces its origin to a small ward for sick children that began in 1903. The new hospital was the most expensive building project in University of Michigan history and one of the most expensive construction projects in state history. Of the $754 million cost, the university financed $588 million through tax-exempt bonds, $91 million through cash reserves from hospital operations, and $75 million through fundraising. The Charles Stewart Mott foundation contributed $25 million to the construction of the new hospital. The building contains 348 single, private room beds divided between the children's and women's hospital including a dedicated pediatric emergency department and trauma center. University of Michigan officials have released plans to convert the old 1969 era C.S. Mott Children's Hospital building into renovated patient wards for the adult University Hospital. The children's hospital is consistently ranked as one of the top pediatric centers in the country according to U.S. News & World Report. == Awards == In 2015, the hospital was named as one of \"The 50 Most Amazing Children\u2019s Hospitals in the World\" by Top Master's in Healthcare Administration.
