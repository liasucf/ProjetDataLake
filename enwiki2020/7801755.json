His father, Philippe Le Muet, was a guardsman in the artillery corps of Burgundy. Pierre Le Muet is mentioned as Architecte Ordinaire du Roi in 1616, when he was paid for a model of the Palais du Luxembourg. From 1617 to about 1637, he was a military engineer. In this capacity he accompanied the royal armies in the south of France. There are surviving plans of fortifications in Picardie (dated 1631, now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Arsenal in Paris) and documentation of work in P\u00e9ronne and Corbie, Somme (1635\u20131638). There is also a ground-floor plan of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires in Paris, work on which was interrupted at an early stage. From the available evidence, he was mostly active in this period as a theorist and publisher, producing in 1623 the first edition of his Mani\u00e8re de b\u00e2tir, a collection of models for town houses in the Parisian mode, designed to occupy eleven lots from the simplest most constricted plot of urban land to h\u00f4tels particuliers of middling importance. Claude Mignot points out that Le Muet's model in this enterprise was Sebastiano Serlio, whose sixth book, Architettura, degli habitationi de tutti li gradi degli huomini was already circulating in France in manuscript.Mignot 1996, 2005. Salomon de Brosse's manuscript copy is at the Avery Library of Columbia University. The enlarged second edition of Mani\u00e8re (1647) added a second volume of Augmentations de nouveaux bastimens. Its engraved illustrations mark the earliest appearance of Jean Marot as an engraver of architectural designs. In 1631 Le Muet married Marie Autissier, daughter of Jean Autissier, one of the leading building contractors of the time. This brought Le Muet closer to the social milieu of his architect contemporaries Jacques Le Mercier, Fran\u00e7ois Mansart, and Louis Le Vau. In 1631\u20131632, Le Muet published a French translation of Vignola's Regola delle cinque ordini d'architectura, from a four-language Dutch edition of 1619. Le Muet's version includes ten previously unpublished designs for doors. He also published a French adaptation (1645) of Paladio's First Book of Architecture, which in 1650 was succeeded by a more faithful and complete version by Fr\u00e9art de Chambray. Mani\u00e8re de b\u00e2tir with his Augmentations was republished by Jean De Puis in 1663-1664 and Fran\u00e7ois Jollain in 1681, and in London a translation was published by Robert Pricke, The Art of Sound Building (1670).Mignot 2005. ==Later career as an architect== Chateau de Chavigny Beginning in 1637 Le Muet produced designs for several ch\u00e2teaux, including: Chavigny (1637\u20131645; mostly destroyed 1833) in Lern\u00e9 for Claude Bouthillier and his son L\u00e9on Bouthillier, comte de Chavigny; the Ch\u00e2teau de Pont-sur-Seine (1638\u20131644; destroyed 1814) for Claude Bouthillier; and the Ch\u00e2teau de Tanlay (1642\u20131645) for Michel Particelli d'Emery. At Tanlay he completed the part of the ch\u00e2teau begun in the 16th century in its original style, but added a vestibule-atrium in a more contemporary taste. The additional designs in the 1647 edition of Maniere also show Le Muet the builder of three Parisian residences, the maison Tubeuf,Built in 1643-1644 for the pr\u00e9sident Jacques Tubeuf (Mignot). and the h\u00f4tels Coquet and d\u2019Avaux (1644\u201350). The engraver Marot worked from drawings furnished by Le Muet which corrected some irregularities demanded by exigencies of the actual sites, regularizing the court at Tanlay, for instance or giving an elevation and section never executed at the h\u00f4tel d\u2019Avaux. Plan of the H\u00f4tel de Chevreuse Le Muet, who remained faithful to the principle of linear room arrangements, constructed several more town houses, including the H\u00f4tel de Chevreuse for Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, duchesse de Chevreuse, in 1660,Mignot 1996, p. 145. and the H\u00f4tel de Ratabon for Antoine de Ratabon in 1664.Mignot 2010, p. 305. His designs for town houses were less inventive than those of Louis Le Vau, but more classically correct. ==See also== Architecture of Paris Other French architects of the first half of the 17th century: *Salomon de Brosse *Liberal Bruant *Jacques Lemercier *Louis Le Vau *Fran\u00e7ois Mansart *Cl\u00e9ment M\u00e9tezeau ==Notes== ==References== * Le Muet, Pierre (1623).
