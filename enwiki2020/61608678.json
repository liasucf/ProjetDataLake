The site of the castle is not known and there are only few sources referring to the castle. ==History== Aborch was founded after demolition of the Kokem\u00e4ki Castle. Aborch is mentioned in 1395 as a part of lands in Satakunta. Aborch was built to protect trade in Kokem\u00e4enjoki area and scholars suggest that it has been located on an island in the river. Islands of Isoluoto and Linnaluoto are among the suggested locations. The castle was left without use in the early 15th century.Salminen, Tapio: Kumo castle, Aborch and Vreghdenborch \u2013 sources and past scholarship, a revision ==References== Category:Castles in Finland Category:Buildings and structures in Satakunta Category:History of Satakunta ",
