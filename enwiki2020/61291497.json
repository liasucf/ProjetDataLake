While clearing mines on July 15, 1919 and HMS Gentian also hit a mine and sank killing nine sailors in the two blasts. ==Design and construction== The Arabis-class was a slightly enlarged and improved derivative of the previous and sloops. They were designed at the start of the First World War as relatively fast minesweepers that could also carry out various miscellaneous duties in support of the fleet such as acting as dispatch vessels or carrying out towing operations, but as the war continued and the threat from German submarines grew, became increasingly involved in anti-submarine duties. Gentian was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal. Two cylindrical boilers fed steam to a four-cylinder triple expansion steam engine rated at , giving a speed of . The Arabis-class had a main armament of two 4.7 inch (120 mm) guns or two 4 inch (102 mm) guns, with two 3-pounder (47 mm) anti-aircraft guns also carried. Gentian was one of the first nine Arabis- class ships, ordered on 6 July 1915. She was built by the Greenock & Grangemouth Dockyard Company at their Greenock shipyard as Yard number 376, was launched on 23 December 1915, and was completed on 28 February 1916. ==Service== On commissioning, Gentian moved to Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, as one of the minesweepers attached to the Grand Fleet. As such, Gentians duties were mainly confined to keeping the approaches to Scapa Flow used by the Grand Fleet clear of mines, with daily sweeping of the prescribed channels. On 30 May 1916, Gentian was 40 miles East of the Pentland Skerries when she was missed by a torpedo, which was probably launched by the German submarine , waiting to attack ships of the Grand Fleet, which fired a torpedo against several sloops in this region on that day. Destroyers and aircraft were ordered out from Scapa to hunt U-43, but although a submarine was sighted, U-43 escaped unharmed. By July 1916, the Grand Fleet's minesweepers had been split into three Flotillas, with Gentian joining the 2nd Fleetsweeping Flotilla. Gentian was still part of the 2nd Minesweeper Flotilla attached to the Grand Fleet at the end of the war on 11 November 1918, but by December that year had transferred to the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla, still supporting the Grand Fleet. Gentian was listed as still a member of the 1st Flotilla, but paid off, in March 1919, and in May 1919, she was listed as in reserve at the Firth of Forth with a nucleus crew. ===Baltic operations=== The British campaign in the Baltic was a part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The codename of the Royal Navy campaign was \"Operation Red Trek\". The intervention played a key role in enabling the establishment of the independent states of Estonia and Latvia but failed to secure the control of Petrograd by White Russian forces, which was one of the main goals of the campaign. The taskforce was vital in supplying the Baltic states as well as containing the Soviet Navies. On 16 July 1919, the 1st Fleet Sweeping Flotilla arrived at Hanko to reinforce the British forces in the Baltic. ==Wreck== In July 2010 an Estonian minesweeper located the remains of the cruiser , Myrtle and Gentian. ==Bibliography== ===Notes=== ===References=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Maritime incidents in 1919 Category:Shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea Category:Ships sunk by mines ",
