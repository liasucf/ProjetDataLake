The website was seized on May 7, 2019 during an investigation into the owners' affiliate marketing model, in which they received money for posting links to certain darknet markets. Coverage has included darknet market drug busts, pedophile crowdfunding, the details of hacking of darknet markets, as well as the diversification of markets such as TheRealDeal selling software exploits. Site features include blacklisted markets, comparisons and reviews. In May 2015, McAfee covered a free ransomware-as-a-service called 'Tox' hosted somewhere on the dark web whose developers gave an interview to DeepDotWeb. ==Domain seizure== Lock screen when opening the page On May 7, 2019, the deepdotweb.com and its sister .onion domain were redirected to a Domain Seizure notice.
