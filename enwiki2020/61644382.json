She captained the soccer team to the 2015 U Sports women's soccer championship, scoring in the 3\u20130 final win over rivals Trinity Western Spartans. ===International career=== Under FIFA eligibility rules, Guy could play for Ireland as her maternal grandmother is Irish. She approached the Football Association of Ireland about playing for the Republic of Ireland women's national under-19 football team, and was called into a squad training camp in January 2012. She played for the under-19s in two friendlies against Scotland in August 2012.

The success of the startup venture and her increased workload as the chief executive officer prompted Guy to pause her soccer career. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Madison Guy at UBC Thunderbirds Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland women's international footballers Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Canadian people of Irish descent Category:Canadian women's soccer players Category:Vancouver Whitecaps FC (women) players Category:Republic of Ireland women's association footballers Category:Soccer people from British Columbia Category:Businesspeople from British Columbia Category:Canadian technology chief executives Category:Canadian technology company founders Category:People from Langley, British Columbia (city) Category:21st-century Canadian businesspeople Category:UBC Thunderbirds soccer players ",
