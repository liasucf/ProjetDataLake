In their fourteenth season under head coach Lon Stiner, the Beavers compiled a 5\u20134\u20133 record (2\u20133\u20132 in PCC, sixth), defeated Hawaii in the Pineapple Bowl on New Year's Day, and outscored their opponents 249 to 236. The team played its home games on campus at Bell Field in Corvallis and at Multnomah Stadium in Portland. The following spring at age 45, Stiner resigned as head coach on March 7. He said at the time, \"A football coach must have full support in his job. I have had excellent support in the past but when the full support no longer exists, a change is for the best for all parties concerned.\" With 16 years of service, he was the dean of the PCC football coaches. He compiled a record of 74\u201349\u201317 (49\u201342\u201313 in PCC) as head coach. ==Schedule== ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Oregon State at Washington State \u2013 November 6, 1948 Category:Oregon State Beavers football seasons Oregon State Beavers Category:Pineapple Bowl champion seasons ",
