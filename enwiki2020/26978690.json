The 2007 West Lancashire District Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of West Lancashire District Council in Lancashire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Party!!Seats!! \u00b1 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Conservative || 33 || +1 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Labour || 21 || -1 |} ==Background== Before the election the Conservatives had a 10-seat majority over Labour, after gaining 3 seats in the 2006 election. 19 seats were being contested in the election with the Conservative leader of the council, Geoff Roberts, being one of those who were defending seats. The election was seen as mainly being fought just between the Conservative and Labour parties, with the Liberal Democrats only standing in 2 wards. The Conservatives were expected to remain in control of the council and were targeting the wards of Scott and Wrightington where Labour only had small majorities. ==Election result== The Conservatives held control of the council after making a net gain of 1 seat to have a majority of 12 over Labour. They gained the seats of Scott and Wrightington from Labour, but lost Bickerstaffe back to Labour. Overall turnout in the election was 31.5%, down from the 32.2% recorded in 2006. ==Ward results== ===Ashurst=== ===Aughton and Downholland=== ===Aughton Park=== ===Bickerstaffe=== ===Birch Green=== ===Derby=== ===Digmoor=== ===Knowsley=== ===Newburgh=== ===North Meols=== ===Parbold=== ===Scarisbrick=== ===Scott=== ===Skelmersdale North=== ===Skelmersdale South=== ===Tanhouse=== ===Tarleton=== ===Up Holland=== ===Wrightington=== ==References== Category:2007 English local elections 2007 Category:2000s in Lancashire ",
