    "text": "The 2019 Louisiana Lieutenant gubernatorial election was held to elect the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana. Incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser won re-election to a second term. Louisiana is the only state that has a jungle primary system where all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. If no candidate had received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 12, 2019, a runoff election would have been held on November 16, 2019, between the top two candidates in the primary. (California and Washington have a similar \"top two primary\" system). ==Candidates== ===Republican Party=== ====Declared==== *Billy Nungesser, incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana ===Democratic Party=== ====Declared==== *Willie Jones, activist ==General election== ===Results=== == See also == *United States elections, 2019 *Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana ==References== ==External links== ;Official campaign websites * Billy Nungesser (R) for Lt.
