    "text": "\"En masse Attendance of Daimyo at Edo Castle on a Festive Day\" from the Tokugawa Seiseiroku, National Museum of Japanese History Sankin-k\u014dtai (, now commonly written as ) was a policy of the Tokugawa shogunate during most of the Edo period of Japanese history.Jansen, Marius B. (2000). The Making of Modern Japan, pp. 127\u2013141. The purpose was to strengthen central control over the daimy\u014ds (major feudal lords). It required feudal lords, daimy\u014d, to alternate living for a year in their domain and in Edo, the capital. ==History== Toyotomi Hideyoshi had earlier established a similar practice of requiring his feudal lords to keep their wives and heirs at Osaka Castle or the nearby vicinity as hostages to ensure their loyalty. Following the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, this practice was continued at the new capital of Edo as a matter of custom. It was made compulsory for the tozama daimy\u014ds in 1635, and for the fudai daimy\u014ds from 1642. Aside from an eight-year period under the rule of Tokugawa Yoshimune, the law remained in force until 1862. ==Description== Sightseers and merchants gazing at an entourage (sixth panel) from \"Folding Screen Depicting Scenes of the Attendance of Daimy\u014ds at Edo Castle\", National Museum of Japanese History The details changed throughout the 26 decades of Tokugawa rule, but generally, the requirement was that the daimy\u014ds of every han move periodically between Edo and his fief, typically spending alternate years in each place. His wife and heir were required to remain in Edo as hostages while he was away. The expenditures necessary to maintain lavish residences in both places, and for the procession to and from Edo, placed financial strains on the daimyo, making them unable to wage war. The frequent travel of the daimyo encouraged road building and the construction of inns and facilities along the routes, generating economic activity. There were a number of exceptions for certain fudai daimy\u014ds in the vicinity of Edo, who were allowed to alternate their attendance in Edo every six months instead. Temporary exceptional dispensations were also occasionally granted due to illness or extreme extenuating circumstances. In principle, the sankin-k\u014dtai was a military service to the sh\u014dgun. Each daimy\u014d was required to furnish a number of soldiers (samurai) in accordance with the kokudaka assessment of his domain. These soldiers accompanied the daimy\u014d on the processions to and from Edo. With hundreds of daimy\u014ds entering or leaving Edo each year, were almost daily occurrences in the shogunal capital. The main routes to the provinces were the kaid\u014d. Special lodgings, the , were available to daimy\u014ds during their travels. The sankin-k\u014dtai figures prominently in some Edo-period ukiyo-e woodblock prints, as well as in popular theater such as kabuki and bunraku. == Similar practices == King Louis XIV of France instituted a similar practice upon the completion of his palace at Versailles, requiring the French nobility, particularly the ancient Noblesse d'\u00e9p\u00e9e (\"nobility of the sword\") to spend six months of each year at the palace, for reasons similar to those of the Japanese sh\u014dguns. The nobles were expected to assist the king in his daily duties and state and personal functions, including meals, parties, and, for the privileged, rising from and getting into bed, bathing, and going to church. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Jansen, Marius B.
