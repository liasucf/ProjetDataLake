    "text": "Wunda is a bright feature at the top of this image of Umbriel. Wunda is a large crater on the surface of Uranus' moon Umbriel. It is 131 km in diameter and is located near the equator of Umbriel. The crater is named after Wunda, a dark spirit of Australian aboriginal mythology. Wunda has a prominent albedo feature on its floor, which takes the shape of a ring of bright material at least 10 km in radial width. The reason for its brightness, which stands out from the very dark composition of the moon as a whole, is unknown. It may be a deposit of carbon dioxide ice. == References == Citations Sources * * * Category:Impact craters on Uranus' moons Category:Umbriel (moon) ",
