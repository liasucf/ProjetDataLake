    "text": "Gustav Elijah \u00c5hr (November 1, 1996 \u2013 November 15, 2017), known professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as LiL PEEP), was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model. He was a member of the emo rap collective GothBoiClique. Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap and rock music, Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure of the mid\u2013late 2010s emo rap scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts and youth subcultures. Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised on Long Island, New York, Lil Peep started releasing music on SoundCloud in 2014, using the pseudonym Lil Peep because his mother had called him \"Peep\" since he was a child. He soon became popular on the platform for his collaborations with Lil Tracy and several mixtapes: Lil Peep; Part One (2015), Live Forever (2015), Crybaby (2016) and Hellboy (2016); the latter's success led him to his first solo tour across the United States. Soon after the tour, Lil Peep emigrated to London, England, where he recorded his debut studio album. While his mixtapes explored emo, trap, lo-fi and alternative rock, his debut album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 (2017) was a transition into pop punk and rap rock. His second album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 (2018) was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200. The documentary film about him, Everybody's Everything, was released in 2019. Lil Peep had substance abuse issues due to his mental health conditions, including depression and bipolar disorder, which often influenced the thematic content of his music. He died in Tucson, Arizona, on November 15, 2017, two weeks after his 21st birthday. The Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner certified the cause of death as an accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax. ==Early life== Gustav Elijah \u00c5hr was born on November 1, 1996, in Allentown, Pennsylvania to first-grade teacher Liza Womack and college professor Karl Johan \u00c5hr. He had one sibling, Karl \"Oskar\" \u00c5hr. \u00c5hr grew up on Long Island, New York. His parents were both Harvard graduates who divorced when he was a teenager. \u00c5hr claimed to have Swedish citizenship on Twitter. Growing up, \u00c5hr's father was absent, with his father and mother divorcing formally when \u00c5hr was 14. He attended Lindell Elementary School and Long Beach High School in Lido Beach, New York, where he was often absent but received good grades and made the dean's list. He later dropped out of high school and took online courses to earn his diploma. Shortly thereafter, he began posting his music on YouTube and SoundCloud. At 17, \u00c5hr got his first face tattoo, a broken heart below his left eye to help motivate him to make music. He moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music under the stage name Lil Peep. He said he moved to Los Angeles because living on Long Island depressed him. Economist and historian of Latin American liberation movements, John Womack, is \u00c5hr's maternal grandfather.Quinn Moreland, The Lil Peep Documentary Everybody\u2019s Everything Is a Cautionary Tale of Modern Music Stardom, The Pitch (Pitchfork), November 14, 2019. == Career == When Lil Peep was a teenager, he called himself a loner who made most of his friends online. Inspired by underground acts like Seshollowaterboyz and iLoveMakonnen, Peep made music while residing in Long Island under the pseudonym \"Trap Goose\" and lived temporarily with childhood friend Brennan Savage until both decided to move to Los Angeles. Lil Peep left high school early to move to Los Angeles and meet up with online friends. He initially lived in Skid Row, Los Angeles, and dipped in and out of homelessness, staying at Savage's apartment while Savage pursued a degree. The two eventually went separate ways and Peep met Atlanta rapper and producer JGRXXN and Florida rappers Ghostemane and Craig Xen, living with them while forming the collective Schemaposse. He originally met Craig Xen online and was introduced to JGRXXN who needed a singer. Lil Peep also attempted to attend Glendale Community College during his first year living in Los Angeles. In 2015, Lil Peep released his first mixtape, Lil Peep; Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever. Lil Peep (left) performing with Fat Nick in 2016 Lil Peep began to grow in popularity soon after, with the song \"Star Shopping\" (later released as a single following his death) from Lil Peep; Part One making waves in underground hip-hop circles. Lil Peep's popularity continued to grow after the release of the song \"Beamer Boy\", which led to him performing live for the first time with the rest of Schemaposse in March 2016 in Tucson, Arizona. The following month, Schemaposse broke up and Lil Peep was no longer associated with a collective, though they remained on good terms. Shortly after Schemaposse's breakup, Peep began to associate with Los Angeles-based rap collective Gothboiclique, featuring members of the group on his full-length mixtape Crybaby. The group shared a squat in Skid Row with Peep and often shared beds. Crybaby was recorded in three days with a $150 microphone. He did a majority of the mixing and mastering himself. Crybaby was released in June 2016. Later that month, First Access Entertainment (FAE) partnered with Lil Peep on a joint venture to invest in and advise him on his career. In addition to providing business guidance, co-founder/CEO Sarah Stennett was a friend who gave both moral and financial support, helping Peep realize his vision. In September 2016, Lil Peep released Hellboy. Songs from Hellboy such as \"Girls\" and \"OMFG\" received millions of views and plays on SoundCloud and YouTube. Hellboy's success led to Peep's first solo tour across the United States, the \"Peep Show\" tour, in April and May 2017. In May 2017, the band Mineral accused Peep of copyright infringement for including an unlicensed and uncredited sample of their song \"LoveLetterTypewriter\" on his track \"Hollywood Dreaming\". Peep said that he was only trying to \"show some love\" with the sample. Soon after the tour was done, Peep emigrated to London, England, during a disentanglement with Gothboiclique. There he began to associate with figures such as Atlanta rapper iLoveMakonnen and longtime friend Bexey (fka Bexey Swan), and recorded Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 and Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2, the EP Goth Angel Sinner and an untitled project with iLoveMakonnen. Peep released his debut studio album, Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1, on August 15, 2017. He also took his first world tour, starting in the UK in September and moving to Germany before finishing in the United States in November, which was cut short by his death. === Posthumous releases === 260x260pxAfter his death, Lil Peep's fanbase and popularity grew quickly, resulting in a significant increase in sales and streams of his music.

On August 17, 2018, Makonnen announced a new Lil Peep single, \"Falling Down\", a reworking of \"Sunlight on Your Skin\" that he recorded with Peep in the fall of 2017 in London. The new version features recently deceased rapper XXXTentacion, who recorded his verses following Peep's death. The creation of the single was condemned by surviving members of GothBoiClique, who said there had been unresolved conflict between the two artists stemming from latter's history of violence towards women. \"Falling Down\" was released on September 19, 2018, and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The original \"Sunlight on Your Skin\" was released on September 27, 2018.

On March 10, 2019, the documentary Everybody's Everything, which chronicles Lil Peep's life, premiered at the SXSW Film Festival. On November 1, 2019, the estate announced the release of the soundtrack to the documentary, which features both released and unreleased tracks.

The estate released the Hellboy mixtape with most samples cleared on September 25, 2020, the fourth anniversary of its original release. The song 'drive by' was reproduced due to sample clearance issues. == Fashion == Lil Peep had been into fashion since his teenage years and during the last months of his life he modelled for Vlone, and was invited to and attended several fashion shows such as Balmain men's show at Paris Fashion Week and Moncler Gamme Bleu MFW Mens Spring Summer show in Milan. Nico Amarca of Hypebeast said \u201ceven though Peep's brand of trendy sits on a far more niche spectrum than most modern-day tastemakers, something that largely attributed to his success. In a time where genuine individuality is becoming increasingly obsolete, Peep was the tattoo-covered, Manic Panic-hued mall rat the creative world needed to disrupt its ever- growing homogeny.\" Rapper Playboi Carti described Lil Peep as a \"trendsetter\". In late 2018, it was announced that a Lil Peep clothing line was being created called \"No Smoking\" (stylized as \"NO SMOK!NG\") which was developed before Lil Peep's death. == Musical style == Lil Peep was described as making lo-fi rap, being an \"emo-trap heart throb\" and an \"emo rapper\". Music journalists often compared Lil Peep to singer-songwriter and guitarist Kurt Cobain. New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica defined Peep as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap, describing his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic. Lil Peep himself encouraged the connection and persona in his musical and lyrical content, saying that he wanted to become the \"New Kurt Cobain\". According to Angus Harrison from The Guardian, Lil Peep was \"repurposing Kurt Cobain for bedroom diarists who are more used to rap than they are guitars.\" AllMusic described Lil Peep's music as a blend of hip hop and rock influences along with trap, punk, and dream pop. His songs generally drew on the triple-time hi-hats of Southern rap and the angsty introspection of post-hardcore. He combined elements of emo and pop punk into rap music, bringing a fresh take on the genre. This resulted in him being described as the \"future of emo\" by Steven J. Horowitz of online magazine Pitchfork. As an burgeoning artist, Lil Peep gained a significant amount of traction in the alternative hip-hop scene, establishing a better platform for himself to speak to fans about topics of his concern such as mental health. His lyrical themes include topics such as depression, drug use, past relationships, and suicidal thoughts and meshes together third-wave emo, alternative rock, pop-punk and dream pop with trap music and hip-hop. A close friend and the executive producer of Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 said that Peep \"wanted to give a voice to people that suffer from anxiety and depression, people who have been abused, bullied, and the people who were misunderstood like him. He had demons of his own and he faced those demons by creating music.\" == Death == On November 15, 2017, Lil Peep was found dead on his tour bus when his manager went to check on him in preparation for that night's performance at a Tucson, Arizona venue. Foul play was not suspected, with his death believed to be from an overdose. In a series of Instagram posts in the hours leading up to his death, Lil Peep claimed to have ingested psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis concentrate. In another, he claimed to have consumed six Xanax pills following a video depicting his attempts to drop an unidentified pill into his mouth several times before successfully swallowing one and shaking a full prescription bottle. A subsequent post was captioned \"When I die, you'll love me.\" In the days after his death, a police report revealed that Lil Peep had taken a nap around 5:45 p.m. before the concert. His manager checked on him twice and found him sleeping and breathing fine, but was unable to wake him. When the manager checked on Lil Peep a third time, he was unresponsive and not breathing. Lil Peep's manager performed CPR before medics arrived, though he was pronounced dead at the scene. Lil Peep's death was recorded on Instagram by his friend Bexey Swan, who believed Lil Peep was asleep. On December 8, the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner released details from a toxicology report, certifying the cause of death was an accidental overdose due to the effects of the pain medication fentanyl and the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Blood tests were positive for cannabis, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol. Urine tests also showed the presence of multiple powerful opioids, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone (dilaudid), oxycodone and oxymorphone. There was no alcohol in his system. ===Tributes=== Numerous artists in the music industry paid tribute to Lil Peep following his death, including Diplo, Post Malone, Pete Wentz, Marshmello, Mark Ronson, Zane Lowe, Sam Smith, Bella Thorne, Trippie Redd, A$AP Nast, Rich Brian, Playboi Carti, Ugly God, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Xan, Ty Dolla Sign, Lil Pump, Dua Lipa, and El-P. Jon Caramanica, a music critic for The New York Times, held a special remembrance podcast episode to honor Peep following his death which was released on November 22, 2017. Good Charlotte also honored Lil Peep, releasing a cover of \"Awful Things\", which was shown at his memorial in Long Beach, New York on December 2, 2017. Three Days Grace paid tribute by posting a video on Instagram and Twitter of a remix of Peep's song \"Witchblades\" featuring Lil Tracy. The remixed song's beat was a slowed down instrumental track of the band's song, \"The Real You\".

In The 1975 track, \"Love It If We Made It\", there is a lyric that gives a tribute to Lil Peep: \"Rest in peace Lil Peep, The poetry is in the streets\". In the song Glass House, by Machine Gun Kelly, which pays tribute to many deceased artists, Lil Peep is mentioned in the lines: \"Wish Lil Peep and me had met, but I can't get that back\". Lil Peep was cremated at Huntington Station, New York and his ashes were placed in his grandfather's garden. On December 2, 2017, friends, family and fans paid their respects to Lil Peep at his memorial in Long Beach, New York.

He earned legions of fans in a short time from both hip hop and emo subcultures. Although he did not claim so himself, he is widely considered to have made a style of music that has been since regarded \"emo rap.\" He has been credited as the leading figure of the mid\u2013late 2010s emo music scene and is commonly cited as an inspiration for upcoming emo rappers. > At the time of Lil Peep\u2019s death, he was on the cusp of something > significant.

The lengthy article resulted in an influx of think pieces centered around Lil Peep amongst writers, with music publications such as Noisey discussing his role within the broader emo genre. Though it allowed Peep to gather attention from a wide audience beyond his SoundCloud base, the piece polarized readers, some whom protested applying the \"future of emo\" label to the young rapper in the headline. However, Lil Peep has since become regarded being an integral part of a \"post-emo revival style of hip hop and rock\", and had been described as \"arguably the biggest emo icon of the past few years\" The death of Lil Peep left an impact on several of his musical contemporaries. Lil Uzi Vert offered tribute by sharing on Twitter an edited version of one of the final photos Lil Peep had shared online. The news of Lil Peep's tragic passing greatly affected Lil Uzi Vert, who shortly tweeted, \"We would love 2 stop ..... but do you really care cause we been on xanax all fucking year. [...] Rip buddy I 100% understand and I don't fault u.\" The prescription pills Xanax has since become an epidemic in the hip hop realm, particularly among the current SoundCloud generation. The SoundCloud rap scene Lil Peep originated from is notorious for its drug use, with artists often abusing prescription pills such as Xanax which have since become a go-to metaphor in their lyrics. In an assessment of the reactions, many were hopeful Lil Peep's death has served as a wake-up call for the community regarding drug abuse. After offering his thoughts, Lil Uzi Vert indicated he was looking to do something for himself in response to Lil Peep's untimely passing. Lil Uzi Vert also seemed to make attempts to detox, and the following Thursday tweeted an update saying he was sober for the day and already shaking. === Attitudes towards abuse of women === In addition to calling him \u201cthe future of emo,\u201d Pitchfork also posited that Lil Peep's willingness to be vulnerable was an antidote to the toxic attitude towards women, which in the past has been a core element of hip-hop culture and its rap-rock variant. According to fellow GothBoiClique member, Fish Narc, Lil Peep explicitly rejected contemporary SoundCloud rapper XXXTentacion for his extensive criminal history of violence against women, spending time and money removing XXX's songs from his Spotify playlists. When the posthumous 2018 single, \"Falling Down\", uniting the two deceased rappers was created without Lil Peep's consent, his fans and friends opposed the retroactive inclusion of XXXTentacion. His surviving band members posted a story onto Instagram disavowing the collaboration and imploring others not to listen to it. Following his death, Mic bemoaned: \"Sadly, Peep had barely just begun bringing emo into the future with a message that many of his less woman-friendly influences, like Brand New, have failed to put forward.\" He continued saying, \"For a 'crybaby' who left this world so young, Peep inspired a lot of people to keep going.\" The day after hearing news of his death, rapper Lil B paid tribute through a tweet. He wrote, \u201cI remember Lil peep telling me he is against the sexual abuse of women and people in the music industry... I will continue to push his vision.\u201d ===Achievements=== Having arisen from SoundCloud scene, Lil Peep was a large presence on social media and came to be revered online. His emotional, downtrodden lyrics attracted a cult following though the songs he released. Lil Peep also enjoyed the draw of his YouTube channel, where several millions of views were generated by his music videos for \"Awful Things,\" \"Benz Truck,\" \"The Brightside\" among others. According to The Atlantic, \"If you were going to bet on the young musicians most likely to soon be superstars, until yesterday, a lot of smart money would have been on Lil Peep.\" Lil Peep had laid before him a promising career, which had been on the rise since 2015 thanks to a series of tracks, EPs and mixtapes released on SoundCloud. After being around for a little more than a year, Lil Peep had already managed to amass millions of hits on YouTube and SoundCloud. A year after posting his first song, Lil Peep attracted 82,000 followers on SoundCloud and 112,000 followers on Instagram. The burgeoning rapper had generated millions of online streams before releasing his debut album Come Over When You're Sober Pt. 1 in August 2017. Despite being involved with GothBoiClique for the shortest amount of time, Lil Peep become the first of his group to be paid serious critical attention as well as tour internationally. Due in part to his divisive nature, Lil Peep made his way onto Pitchfork's \"Best Songs of the Year\" list and completed a largely sold-out tour of Russia and Europe. == Personal life == Lil Peep's growing fanbase enjoyed his refreshing candor about struggles with his sexuality in addition to depression, heartbreak, and drug use. Lil Peep came out as bisexual in a Twitter post on August 8, 2017. He took to Twitter to open up about this aspect of his personal life to his fans. Lil Peep simply stated, \u201cyes i'm bi sexual.\u201d Some time later, he followed up the post by asking his fans if any of them wanted a kiss. After coming out as bisexual, he would regularly confront homophobes on Twitter. He was also known collaborators with iLoveMakonnen, an openly gay recording artist whose music also blurs the line between rap and rock. Lil Peep came out around the time he and actress and singer Bella Thorne began dating in September 2017. Shortly after the release of his debut studio album, the two were spotted kissing. They briefly dated, before Thorne became involved with rapper Mod Sun. While on the Come Over When You're Sober tour, Lil Peep had met and started dating Instagram influencer Arzaylea Rodriguez around the time of his death in November. Lil Peep actively talked about his issues with depression, anxiety and substance abuse and stated that he had bipolar disorder. Alongside drug use, Lil Peep struggled with suicidal impulses which date back to his adolescent years. On the track \u201cOMFG\u201d from his breakthrough mixtape Hellboy, Lil Peep talked about wanting to kill himself. During an interview, he was asked if he was suicidal. Lil Peep replied, \"Yeah, it is serious. I suffer from depression and some days I wake up and I'm like, Fuck, I wish I didn't wake up. That was part of why I moved to California, trying to get away from the place that was doing that to me, and the people I was around.\" He continued, \"I realized it was just myself\u2014it's a chemical imbalance in my brain. Some days I'll be very down and out, but you won't be able to tell, really, because I don't express that side of myself on social media. That's the side of myself that I express through music. That's my channel for letting all that shit out.\" He claims the frankness with which he spoke about difficulties in his life led to an intense connection with his fans through his music. In an interview with The Times, Lil Peep stated, \"They tell me that it saved their lives. They say that I stopped them from committing suicide, which is a beautiful thing. ... It's great for me to hear. It helps. It boosts me, because music saved my life as well.\" Lil Peep was not medicated for depression. While those around him insisted, he didn't want to, and opted to just like smoking marijuana and whatever other drug came his way. In his final interview before his death with Zane Lowe, Peep confessed that his depression was getting worse saying \"Things just get worse. Things already get worse and worse and worse every day.\" Lil Peep regularly referenced addictions to cocaine, ecstasy and Xanax in his lyrics and posts on social media. where he described himself as a \"productive junkie\" and advised his audience to avoid drug use. Lil Peep had a close relationship with his mother, going so far as to tattoo her initials and birthday on his arm as his first tattoo at the age of fourteen. He played the trombone and tuba and expressed an interest in music and fashion from a young age. At the time of his death, Lil Peep was residing in Portobello Road, London with his friend and close collaborator, Bexey and Smokeasac. The move was provoked by Peep's need to escape his circumstances and his then-collective GOTHBOICLIQUE. Lil Peep may have been a fan of the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils, as he can be seen wearing a shirt bearing their logo on the cover of his mixtape, Hellboy. ==Discography== * Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 (2017) * Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 (2018) == References == == Further reading == * Category:1996 births Category:2017 deaths Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:American hip hop musicians Category:American male rappers Category:American people of Swedish descent Category:Bisexual men Category:Bisexual musicians Category:Drug-related deaths in Arizona Category:Accidental deaths in Arizona Category:East Coast hip hop musicians Category:Emo rap musicians Category:Mumble rappers Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT people from Pennsylvania Category:LGBT rappers Category:Long Beach High School (New York) alumni Category:People from Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:People from Long Island Category:People with bipolar disorder Category:Rappers from New York (state) Category:Rappers from Pennsylvania Category:Writers from New York City Category:LGBT singers from the United States ",
