    "text": "The coat of arms of the University of Notre Dame is the assumed heraldic achievement of the University of Notre Dame. ==History== The coat of arms of the University of Notre Dame was commissioned in early 1931 by university president Charles L O\u2019Donnell, C.S.C. The coat of arms was devised by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, one of America's most prominent heraldrists and designer of the coat of arms of Harvard University's Graduate Schools and the University of Chicago among others. He sent his proposed design of armorial bearings in February 1931, and it was immediately accepted and assumed. The coat of arms, inserted into a circular device with written \"Sigillum Universitatis Dominae Nostrae a Lacu\" became the university seal. Since 2003, the university relies on a two-colored academic mark consisting of a modified version of the coat of arms, with only two colors, and the official wordmark of the university. ==Design== ===Blazon=== :Azure, a passion cross patty at the extremities Or, issuant of a champagne barry wavy of four Argent and the First, in dexter chief a mullet of six points of the Third, and over all an open book proper charged with the words VITA DULCEDO SPES in letters Sable. ===Meaning=== The colors blue and gold (azure and gules in heraldry), the official colors of the university, represent Our Lady. The star represents the ancient title of Our Lady, Star of the Sea. The two wavy lines of silver at the base of the shield, used in heraldry to depict water, are used to represent the two lakes on campus form which the university gets its name (Notre Dame Du Lac). The cross represents the Congregation of Holy Cross, congregation to which university founder Edward Sorin and following presidents were part of. The open book represents learning and education, and the didactic mission of the university. On its pages is written the motto of the university \"Vita, Dulcedo, Spes,\" from the ancient prayer Salve Regina meaning \"our life, our sweetness, our hope\". ==Other versions== File:University of Notre Dame seal (3).jpg|Used between 1898 and 1901. File:Second Seal of the University of Notre Dame.png|Used between 1901 and 1930.
