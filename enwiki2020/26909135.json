In 2014, Thompson and teammate Stephen Curry set a then-NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season, earning the pair the nickname of \"the Splash Brothers.\" In 2015, Thompson helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA Championship since 1975, and was a key contributor in the Warriors' 2017 and 2018 titles. He sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals and missed the entirety of the 2019\u201320 season. ==Early life== Thompson was born in Los Angeles to Julie and Mychal Thompson. His mother was a volleyball player in college for the University of Portland and University of San Francisco, while his father was the first overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft. When Thompson was two, he and his family moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Kevin Love. At age 14, the Thompsons moved to Ladera Ranch, California, where Klay graduated from Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 2008. In his junior season he was named to the All-Area second team and to the Orange County third team. As a senior Thompson averaged 21 points per game and led SMCHS to a 30\u20135 record and a Division III State Championship appearance.

Warriors general manager Larry Riley praised Thompson for his shooting ability and expressed confidence that Thompson would improve his defensive skills with new coach Mark Jackson. The NBA did not select Thompson for the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. However, in the four games after that decision, Thompson improved in all areas of basketball over his current season averages: points per game (12.5 over 7.6), shooting percentage (54.3% overall including 55.6% for three- pointers, up from 46.7 and 48.1), rebounds (2.8 from 1.6), assists (1.5 from 1.3), steals, and turnovers. The Warriors traded Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 13, 2012. The following game, Thompson scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics. A week later, he exceeded his previous high with 27 points in a win over the New Orleans Hornets.

On February 13, he competed in the All-Star Weekend's Three-Point Contest and won the event after defeating Curry and Devin Booker in the final round. On March 25, he scored 40 points against the Dallas Mavericks. Two days later, he had another 40-point game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 40 points in consecutive games for the first time in his career. On April 7, Thompson scored 14 points against the San Antonio Spurs, helping the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season.

The Warriors went on to lose to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals in seven games, despite being up 3\u20131 in the series. ====2016\u201317 season: Second NBA Championship==== Thompson opened the first six games of the 2016\u201317 season shooting 11-of-53 from 3-point range (20.75 percent). In the last 11 games of November, Thompson then went a combined 39-of-84 from 3-point range (46.4 percent).

Thompson had an NBA season-high and career-best performance for the highest-scoring output by a Golden State player in more than 42 years. His 40 first-half points tied him for second-most scored in a half over the past decade. In addition, Thompson became the first Warrior to score 60 points since Hall of Famer Rick Barry's 64 on March 26, 1974, joining Naismith honorees Wilt Chamberlain and Joe Fulks as the only Golden State players to do so.

He relies upon a shooting form that has been described as \"textbook\" and \"picture- perfect\". Though he is capable of handling the ball in the Warriors offense, Thompson is primarily a catch-and-shoot player, taking advantage of back-cuts and screens set by teammates to make space for his exceptionally accurate quick-release shot. Although Thompson is not known for blocking shots or creating steals, he is considered a strong defender thanks to his size at the guard position and ability to defend against both elite guards and wings. He is also praised for his stamina. Thompson is also known for his quiet, laid- back personality, rarely showing emotion in or out of games. He is one of the few players in the NBA sponsored by Chinese shoe company Anta, signing a 10-year deal with it in 2016. ==Career statistics== ===NBA=== ====Regular season==== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 66 || 29 || 24.4 || .443 || .414 || .868 || 2.4 || 2.0 || .7 || .3 || 12.5 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 82 || 82 || 35.8 || .422 || .401 || .841 || 3.8 || 2.2 || 1.0 || .5 || 16.6 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 81 || 81 || 35.4 || .444 || .417 || .795 || 3.1 || 2.2 || .9 || .5 || 18.4 |- | style=\"text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;\"| \u2020 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 77 || 77 || 31.9 || .463 || .439 || .879 || 3.2 || 2.9 || 1.1 || .8 || 21.7 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 80 || 80 || 33.3 || .470 || .425 || .873 || 3.8 || 2.1 || .8 || .6 || 22.1 |- | style=\"text-align:left; background:#afe6ba;\"| \u2020 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Golden State | 78 || 78 || 34.0 || .468 || .414 || .853 || 3.7 || 2.1 || .8 || .5 || 22.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left; background:#afe6ba;\"| \u2020 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 73 || 73 || 34.3 || .488 || .440 || .837 || 3.8 || 2.5 || .8 || .5 || 20.0 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 78 || 78 || 34.0 || .467 || .402 || .816 || 3.8 || 2.4 || 1.1 || .6 || 21.5 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=2| Career | 615 || 578 || 33.1 || .459 || .419 || .848 || 3.5 || 2.3 || .9 || .5 || 19.5 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | All-Star | 5 || 1 || 20.4 || .379 || .379 || 1.000 || 5.0 || 3.4 || .4 || .0 || 12.6 ====Playoffs==== |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2013 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 12 || 12 || 41.3 || .437 || .424 || .833 || 4.6 || 1.8 || 1.0 || 0.6 || 15.2 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 7 || 7 || 36.7 || .408 || .364 || .792 || 3.4 || 3.6 || 1.0 || 0.7 || 16.4 |- | style=\"text- align:left;background:#afe6ba;\"| 2015\u2020 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 21 || 21 || 36.2 || .446 || .390 || .800 || 3.9 || 2.6 || 0.8 || 0.9 || 18.6 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2016 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 24 || 24 || 35.4 || .444 || .422|| .854 || 3.7 || 2.3 || 1.1 || 0.4 || 24.3 |- | style=\"text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;\"| 2017\u2020 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Golden State | 17 || 17 || 35.0 || .397 || .387 || .788 || 3.9 || 2.1 || 0.8 || 0.3 || 15.0 |- | style=\"text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;\"| 2018\u2020 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 21 || 21 || 37.8 || .465 || .427 || .871 || 4.1 || 1.8 || 0.8 || 0.3 || 19.6 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2019 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Golden State | 21 || 21 || 39.0 || .456 || .443 || .902 || 4.1 || 2.1 || 1.3 || 0.7 || 20.7 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2| Career | 123 || 123 || 37.2 || .442 || .415 || .841 || 4.0 || 2.2 || 1.0 || 0.5 || 19.3 ===College=== |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|2008\u201309 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Washington State |33||33||33.1||.421||.412||.903||4.2||1.9||0.9||0.6||12.5 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|2009\u201310 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Washington State |31||30||35.4||.412||.364||.801||5.1||2.3||1.4||0.7||19.6 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|2010\u201311 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Washington State |34||33||34.7||.436||.398||.838||5.2||3.7||1.6||0.9||21.6 |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career |98||96||34.4||.424||.390||.827||4.8||2.6||1.3||0.7||17.9 ==Accomplishments and awards== * 3\u00d7 NBA champion: , , * 5\u00d7 NBA All-Star: , , , , * 2\u00d7 All-NBA Third Team: , * NBA All-Defensive Second Team: * NBA Three-Point Contest champion: * NBA All-Rookie First Team: * NBA regular season record for most points scored in a quarter (37) * NBA regular season record for most three- pointers made in a game (14) * NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single playoffs (98 tied with Stephen Curry) * NBA playoff record for most three-pointers made in a game (11) ==Personal life== Thompson's older brother, Mychel, played basketball for Pepperdine University and had a brief stint in the NBA with Cleveland, while his younger brother, Trayce, became a Major League Baseball player.
