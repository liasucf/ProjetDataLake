Chronological index of patents applied for and patents. p. 9. They further lived in Waterloo Road, London in the 1870s and in Croydon, a large town in South London, in the 1880s. After working in industry for some years, Burgh started a practice as consulting marine engineer in 1859. He became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1870, and was elected the first president of the Institution of Marine Engineers.Marine Engineering and Shipbuilding Abstracts, Vol 1\u20135. p. 75. One of his apprentices was the mechanical engineer, inventor and general manager George Best Martin (1847\u20131901),George Best Martin at gracesguide.co.uk. Retrieved 06.2015. and another pupil was William Wallington Harris (1841\u20131924).William Wallington Harris at gracesguide.co.uk. Retrieved 06.2015. Burgh published his first article in the London-based monthly magazine The Engineer in 1859 about his patented design for an improved steam engine.N.P. Burgh. \"Burgh's Steam Engines: patent date 11 January 1859\" in: The Engineer, 1859/08/26. p. 154. In the 1860s he further came into prominence, when he gave several lectures at the Royal Society of Arts in LondonReview \"On Marine Engines, from 1851 to the Present Time,\" in: Andrew Betts Brown (1866), Engineering Facts and Figures. p. 218-230. and started publishing several books. More of those books were revised, enlarged and republished in the next decades. He kept writing articles for The Engineer on a regular base until the mid 1870s. == Works == === Burgh's steam engine, 1859 === Burgh's steam engine, 1859 In an 1859 article in The Engineer Burgh pictured and described an improved arrangement for a marine steam engine, which he had patented early that year. The picture showed: * the vertical sectional view of a marine engine (fig 1) being taken on the lines C, D, and B (of fig 2) * the general plan view of a pair of such engines, the cylinder of the aft engine and the air-pump and valve arrangements of the first engine being shown in section * the transverse sectional view (of Fig. 2) taken on the line G, H, showing the cylinder of one engine, And the air-pump and condenser of the other engine alongside of it, the connecting rods, guide piece, and block, being removed; and * the two main bearings and their brasses being shown in section. Burgh further explained that \"in the illustrations a is the steam cylinder, b the for~end cover, which may be either cast as part of the cylinder or may be separate therefrom; c a trunk or tube securely attached to the fore-end cover of the cylinder, the fore cod of such trunk or tube being open, whilst the back or inner end is closed perfectly steam- tight... (etc.)\" === A treatise on sugar machinery, 1863 === A treatise on sugar machinery, Plate 1, 1863 In the preface to \"A treatise on sugar machinery\" (1863) Burgh explained that the work was \"intended for the use of Sugar Planters, Refiners, Engineers, etc. showing the present process of producing sugar from the cane, and of manufacturing and arranging the machinery. The designs and rules are given from practice, but at the same time, may be susceptible of improvement.\"Burgh (1863, preface) The book was divided into three parts, which Burgh described as follows: > ANALYSIS PROCESS : ... to enable correct calculations to be made, so as to > determine the machinery, etc., requisite in proportion to the produce > required... MANUFACTURING MACHINERY: In this part of the work the author has > endeavoured to show the mode of producing effective and durable machinery of > the best kind he is at present conversant with. ERECTING AND CONNECTING: > ...the proper method of erecting and constructing the whole of the machinery > used in the produce of sugar from the cane; but more particularly that of > the sugar mill and vacuum pan, these two apparatus being the most essential. === Modern Marine Engineering, 1867 === Modern Marine Engineering, title page, 1867 An 1867 review of this work in Scientific American gave the following introduction of this work > Although the marine steam engine, in general, is essentially the same today. > as it was ten years ago, the details of it, and the practice of today > compared with thc past are so changed for the better that the mechanical > portion of the community are always ready and eager to obtain a knowledge of > the construction at the present time. English writers have, with a iew > exceptions, supplied all the literature of the profession, and to them we > look for the best works on the subject. John Bourne has rendered substantial > service in this way, and there are no works on mechanical engineering more > useful and reliable than his \"Catechism,\" and later \" Hand Book.\" We have > before us a new work on \"Modern Marine Engineering,\" applied to paddle and > screw steamers, by N. P. Burgh, engineer. The work is published in England, > and issued in New York by D. Van Nostrand, No. 192 Broadway.\"Modern Marine > Engineering,\" in: Scientific American, Vol. 14, Issue 19, (May 6, 1866) The review proceeds with a summary of the first chapter: > The first number contains drawings of a new set of engines recently built in > England for a Russian frigate. These are made to scale, and accurately > colored to represent the different metals employed. The colors are those > generally used by the profession, not attempts at pictures. They give a > clear idea of the plan and general arrangement. The style in which the work > is got up challenges attention. The type is large and fine, the matter is > double-leaded, and in point of mechanical execution faultless. The scope of > the text is somewhat comprehensive; and in view of the interest always > attaching to the subject, the reader scans every page attentively. Mr. Burgh > goes into the subject quite prepared, indeed confident of his ability to > cope with any question, and after discussing some of the types of engines in > general use, he alludes to our forefathers as follows: > \u201cTo design engines-on land, and correctly manage, or rather attend to them > at sea. would puzzle some of our forefathers, whose originations were > nevertheless fair examples of that age of progression; what may seem > perfection of arrangement, even after construction, on land, will often > betray want of foresight as to access for repair or renewal at sea.\" === The Indicator Diagram Practically Considered, 1869 === One of the later books Burgh published was on the indicator diagram, since the early 20th century named pressure volume diagram or PV diagram. This was the first (and only) book solely devoted to the indicator diagram, its theoretical background, and its applications. This type of diagram was developed late 18th century in the workshop of Boulton and Watt by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758\u20131815). It was used to improve the efficiency of engines, and kept a trade secret until the 1830s. In the 1850s William John Macquorn Rankine in 1859/1866William John Macquorn, 1820\u20131872. A manual of the steam engine and other prime movers. Published 1866 was one of the first to give a detailed description of the device. According to Miller (2011): > A detailed and influential treatment of the indicator within the framework > of a newly developing 'engineering science' was given by W. J. Macquorn > Rankine, in his A Manual of the Steam Engine (1859). Rankine not only > reconceptualized the indicator diagram as what he called the 'diagram of > energy', but also offered a substantial scientific account of how departures > of real indicator diagrams from the ideal could be linked to operating > characteristics of engines and of the indicator itself.Miller, David Philip. > \"The Mysterious Case of James Watt's'\" 1785\" Steam Indicator': Forgery or > Folklore in the History of an Instrument?.\" International Journal for the > History of Engineering & Technology 81.1 (2011): 129\u2013150. More works in those days described the diagram and its origin, such as in the 1865 Handbook of the steam-engineBourne, John. Handbook of the steam-engine, London : Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green, 1865. Chapter six. by the British engineer John Bourne. In the chapter on \"The power and performance of engines\" he introduced the device and made extensive use of indicator diagrams. In the first chapter of his 1869 work Burgh gave a general description of the state of the art on this subject in those days: Mr Richards' Indicator, 1869. Practical definition of Indicator diagram, 1869. Air and Water Pump Indicator Diagram, 1869. > A VERY large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession > look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production; and even supposing > that they comprehend how it is formed, they do not understand the causes for > the various forms of figures. There is, therefore undoubtedly, room for a > practical work on the subject which shall deal with the matter just as a > learner requires : leading him on step by step without slipping, and > impressing on his mind all the realities of the case... The best course of > instruction for the young engineer then is, that the truth of each minute > portion of the subject before him be laid bare, so that he can comprehend > it. When he understands thus far, obviously his knowledge will enable him to > put the same into practice boldly : for by being acquainted with the ground- > work of the subject, he is master also to a great extent of the result of > his labours.Burgh (1869; p. 1-2) In the preface Burgh explained, that the book describes all inns and outs of the PV diagram in the following ten steps:Burgh (1869; preface); Cited in: Tomlinson, Charles, and Henry W. Reveley. \"Publications issued,\" in: Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol. 17, no. 838.\" (1868). p. 61-62. > * Chapter I. contains the description and use of the indicator, > illustrating, at a working scale, Messrs. Maudslays' and Mr. Richards' > Indicators (see image). * Chapter II. is under the heading, \"How to take an > indicator diagram correctly:\" which treats of the action of the steam in the > cylinder ; the definition of the diagram ; correct indicator gear for > horizontal, vertical, and oscillating engines, and indicating notes. * > Chapter III. deals with the proof of atmospheric pressure and particulars of > steam pressures, and includes rules and tables bearing on the subject, with > practical examples and illustrations. * Chapter IV. is a complete > description and illustration of the theoretical geometry of the indicator > diagram in a more practical manner than hitherto published. * Chapter V. is > the practical geometry of the indicator diagram, which fully explains the > frontispiece plate and other figures in connection with it. * Chapter VI. > commences the illustrations of indicator diagrams and gear constructed by > the firms I have mentioned, and others whose names are noted under the > figures : this chapter contains twenty-one diagrams from ordinary modern > screw engines of all classes; three from compound engines ; three of steam- > launch engines ; and two illustrations of indicator gear for return acting > engines. * Chapter VII. is devoted to diagrams taken from the most modem > paddle-engines, and contains eighteen illustrations of them; also the most > improved indicator gear by Messrs. Penn and Napier, for oscillating engines. > * Chapter VIII. treats of land-engine indicator diagrams, showing eleven > examples taken from various classes, including locomotive engines. * Chapter > IX. fully explains and illustrates air and water pump diagrams. * Chapter X. > closes this work, with the explanation of the indicated horse-power in > connection with the diagram. This work was republished several times in Burgh's days. The fourth edition of this work was published in 1876,Spon's Engineers and Contractor's Illustrated Book of Prices of Machines, Tools, Ironwork, and Contractors' Material, for 1876. Spon, 1876. p. 546. and the fifth edition in 1879.Georg August D. Ritter (1879), Elementary theory and calculation of iron bridges and roofs. p. 405. == Reception == Burgh was well known is his days. Many of the books were republished in his time. His Pocket-Book of Practical Rules for the Proportions of Modern Engines and Boilers for Land and Marine purposes even ran until the 7th edition in the mid 1880s,Harry Robert Kempe (1884). A handbook of electrical testing. p. 507 and his Engineer. King's Notes on Steam, reached the nineteenth edition in 1882.Albert Benjamin Prescott (1882). Outlines of Proximate Organic Analysis. p. 196 In the 1860s his work became internationally known. In the United States the Scientific American journal published reviews of his work, and his work was published by David Van Nostrand's D. Van Nostrand Company in New York. In Germany the engineer Conrad Matschoss (1908) acknowledged, that Burgh and John Bourne where the foremost authors on marine steam engines in the 1850s and 1860s.Conrad Matschoss (1908). Die entwicklung der dampfmaschine: Eine geschichte der ortsfesten dampfmaschine und der lokomobile, der schiffsmaschine und lokomotive, Volume 2. p. 447 After his death in the 20th century new developments in the field made Burgh's works obsolete, but references to his work kept appearing regularly on a small scale. For example, one of those references from 1930s mentioned that: > ... particulars and drawings of their boilers and engines are given in > Modern Marine Engineering, by N. P. Burgh, published in 1872. The most > original design was that of J. and G. Rennie, for whereas Penns and > Maudslays both retained the locomotive boiler and non-condensing > engines...Edgar Charles Smith (1937) A short history of naval and marine > engineering. p. 235 Another 1940 publication in the Combustion journal mentioned that: > Most interesting treatise on boilers, by N. P. Burgh, published in 1873, has > just come to the attention of the Editor. Because of the many unique > arrangements therein presented, it is believed that Combustion readers will > find a description of some of these designs of particular interest in > revealing the ingenuity and thinking of engineers of those days.Carl Stripe > (1940). Combustion. Vol.12\u201313. p. 34 Burgh's work was not completely forgotten. Also in the second part of the 20th century references to his work kept being made. For example, in 1967 Adrian Arthur Bennett mentioned Burgh's books \"Rules for Designing, Constructing and Erecting Land and Marine Engines and Boilers,\" and \"Modern Screw Propulsion\" playing a role in the introduction of Western science and technology into China in the Nineteenth-century.Adrian Arthur Bennett. John Fryer: The Introduction of Western Science and Technology Into Nineteenth-century China. East Asian Research Center, Harvard University; distributed by Harvard University Press, 1967. p. 8 In 1990 Stephen Hughes referred to Burgh's correspondence on the beam engine in his The Archaeology of an Early Railway System.Stephen Hughes (1990), The Archaeology of an Early Railway System. p. 119 and Richard L. Hills mentioned his work in his \"History of the Stationary Steam Engine.\"Richard L. Hills (1993).
