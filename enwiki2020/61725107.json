In 2015, his song titled \"Bout It\", featuring Daniel James & Benjamin O, was met with commercial success and garnered millions of streams across SoundCloud and Spotify. ==Early life== Originally from Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, Zucker was raised in a musical household with his parents and two older brothers. While a student at Ramapo High School, he began making music in his bedroom and later became part of a band called the \u201cForeshadows\u201d. After graduating high school, he attended Colorado College where he graduated in 2018 with a degree in molecular biology.Gerace, Joseph M. \"Ramapo Student Inspires Giving at Paterson School; Jeremy Zucker not only gave, but inspired others to open up their hearts\", Wyckoff, NJ Patch, January 7, 2013.

And now, he's embarking on a new chapter in his life, recently releasing his fifth EP glisten and preparing for his first U.S. headlining tour in the fall.... Originally from Franklin Lakes, N.J., Zucker was raised in a musical household with his parents and two older brothers.\" Before producing his own music, he told Billboard in an interview that his first job was a snowboard instructor at a ski mountain (later becoming a skiing instructor). ==Career== In 2015, Zucker released \"Beach Island\". This EP is the oldest musical record Zucker has up on his platforms. He released his third studio EP \"Breathe\" , containing breakthrough hit \"\u2018Bout It\" in December 2016. In 2017, Zucker released his EP \"Motions\", featuring the song \"Heavy\", which later the recording artist blackbear remixed into \"Make Daddy Proud\", and included on his own LP Digital Druglord five months later.

In September 2018, Zucker released the EP \"summer,\" which contains Zucker's well known song \"comethru\". \"comethru\" is a response to the way Zucker felt after graduating college in May 2018 and moving back home to New Jersey into the same house where Zucker grew up.
