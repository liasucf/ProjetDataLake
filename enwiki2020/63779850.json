    "text": "Paenibacillus larvae is a species of bacterium, found worldwide, which causes American foulbrood, a fatal disease of the larvae of honeybees (Apis mellifera). It is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, which forms spores which can remain viable for at least thirty-five years. ==Morphology== P. larvae is a rod-shaped bacterium with slightly rounded ends, approximately 2.5\u20135 \u03bcm long and 0.5 \u03bcm wide. The spore of P. larvae is oval, approximately 0.6 \u03bcm wide and 1.3 \u03bcm long. ==Classification== In 1906, G.F. White first described the bacteria which caused American foulbrood, and named it Bacillus larvae. In 1950, a bacteria isolated from bee larvae and associated with the rare disease \"powdery scale\" was named Bacillus pulvifaciens by Katznelson. In 1993, both B. larvae and B. pulvifaciens were transferred to a new genus, Paenibacillus. The two species were combined into a single species: Paenibacillus larvae in 1996, remaining differentiated as two subspecies: P. larvae ssp. larvae (formerly Bacillus larvae) and P. larvae ssp. pulvifaciens (formerly Bacillus pulvifaciens). In 2006, the subspecies were eliminated based on spore morphology, biochemical profile and DNA testing, and when it was also demonstrated that experimental infection of honeybee larvae with the pulvifaciens subspecies caused American foulbrood signs without causing \"powdery scale\". There are four strains of P. larvae, named after their enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequences. Strains I and II correspond to the former species of Bacillus larvae, and strains III and IV correspond to the former species of B. pulvifaciens. ==Epidemiology== P. larvae is found worldwide. Strain ERIC I is found worldwide, whereas ERIC II is found only in Europe. Strains ERIC III and IV are found in bacteriology archives and are considered practically unimportant. ==American foulbrood== P. larvae causes American foulbrood in honeybees. The most virulent strain of P. larvae is ERIC II, which can cause the death of all larvae in a hive within 7 days of infecting the colony. ==References== Category:Paenibacillaceae ",
