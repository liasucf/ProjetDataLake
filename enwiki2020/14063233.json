    "text": "Anno Dracula is a 1992 novel by British writer Kim Newman, the first in the Anno Dracula series. It is an alternate history using 19th-century English historical settings and personalities, along with characters from popular fiction. The interplay between humans who have chosen to \"turn\" into vampires and those who are \"warm\" (humans) is the backdrop for the plot which tracks Jack the Ripper's politically charged destruction of vampire prostitutes. The reader is alternately and sympathetically introduced to various points of view. The main characters are Jack the Ripper, and his hunters Charles Beauregard (an agent of the Diogenes Club), and Genevi\u00e8ve Dieudonn\u00e9, an elder vampire. The two other main point of views are Captain Kostaki, a sympathetic elder vampire warrior of Dracula's Carpathian Guard, and Lord Godalming, ambitious, scheming aide of Prime Minister Ruthven. == Plot == In this world, Count Dracula has killed Van Helsing. An injury sustained to Doctor John Seward's hand during a fight with Renfield resulted in the group lacking the men to drive Dracula away from Mina Harker, resulting in Dracula killing Quincey Morris and Jonathan Harker before escaping with Mina. With no one to oppose him, Dracula turns Mina into a vampire, adding her to his collection of brides, and proceeds to spread his vampire curse creating thousands of undead throughout England. He soon marries Queen Victoria, ushering in a period of increasing British vampire domination. Dracula is well advanced in imposing a police state in the United Kingdom, where dissenters may be jailed or impaled without trial. Dieudonn\u00e9 has come down in the world, attending sick vampires in a clinic run by a doctor with a shady past. When a prostitute is murdered, Scotland Yard turns to them for an opinion. In the meantime Beauregard's social marriage preparations are interrupted by a summons to the mysterious Diogenes Club, which represents the crown in matters that cannot be made public. There, he is charged with finding Jack the Ripper. At the inquest for the recently destroyed vampire prostitute, Dieudonn\u00e9 and Beauregard appear, along with Captain Kostaki, Lestrade from Scotland Yard, and Dr. Jekyll. Each sets out independently, with differing agendas. Beauregard is abducted by an old enemy, a Tong leader who calls a truce on the understanding that Beauregard will collaborate in finding the killer. This precludes the Ripper being a member of organized crime, and periodically gives Beauregard inside information. Dieudonn\u00e9 stops at a pub, where she encounters a group of elite Carpathian mercenaries whom Dracula brought to London as his household guard. She confronts one bully, and, being the elder vampire, soundly bests him, gaining the notice and respect of one of their number who was also at the inquest, Captain Kostaki. Jack Seward, the physician at Dieudonn\u00e9's clinic, recalls the early days of Dracula in London, before the signs of vampirism were recognized. As the demands of the Diogenes Club have first priority, a rift opens between Beauregard and his fianc\u00e9e. Her fascination with social climbing is revealed: \"Only vampires get anywhere, Charles.\" The intimates of Dracula discuss their continued takeover of the government, and set their own man to find Jack the Ripper. Meanwhile, the destruction of vampire prostitutes is drawing unwanted support for an anti-vampire Christian group. Seward becomes lustfully entangled with a \"new born\" vampire. Jack the Ripper strikes twice, failing to destroy one, who is brought to the clinic. The prostitute is a vampire of Dracula's line \u2014 a contaminated bloodline, from Dieudonn\u00e9's perspective. It imperfectly changes shape, leaping at Seward as it dies. Trusting their associates, the implication is lost on Dieudonn\u00e9 and Beauregard. Seward notes the growing public hysteria, and reflects \"I meant to destroy a monster, not become one.\" Beauregard and Dieudonn\u00e9, having similar ideas, become closer, while his fianc\u00e9e is increasingly annoyed at his lack of attention. Reporting to the Diogenes, Beauregard is puzzled that his meager progress is satisfactory. Leaving, he becomes entangled in an anti-vampire riot. However, he's saved by one of the few vampires at the club, Sergeant Dravot. Beauregard's impatient fianc\u00e9e becomes a vampire by one of Dracula's men. In her arrogance, the conversion does not go well, and she is barely able to reach the safety of her house. Beauregard and Dieudonn\u00e9 take her in care, Dieudonn\u00e9 observing, without being complimentary, that she may eventually become a strong vampire. Riots escalate, symbols of rebellion are being painted throughout London. An anti-vampire leader is shot, and one of Dracula's henchmen is destroyed, both perhaps by the same mysterious vampire. The ruling vampires react decisively. A large number of prominent people are to be imprisoned and treated ruthlessly, including George Bernard Shaw, Lewis Carroll, and W. S. Gilbert. In a converging plotline, Captain Kostaki and a human Inspector named Mackenzie pursue the mysterious vampire riling everyone up, Kostaki being shot in the knee by a silver bullet in the process. Before Mackenzie can report everything he knows to his inept superior, the vampire appears in the midst of a distraction, murders him and frames Captain Kostaki for it. The Captain allows himself to be arrested and taken to the Tower of London, where Graf Orlok now resides as the Governor. Meanwhile, Seward becomes increasingly infatuated with his vampire lover, Mary Kelly, having trouble distinguishing her now from the murdered Lucy. In Dravot, Dracula's henchmen Godalming believes he has found Jack the Ripper. After questioning Kostaki in the Tower of London, he is pursuing Dravot when he is killed by an old friend who he betrayed by becoming a vampire: Seward. Beauregard and Dieudonn\u00e9 finally realize that Seward is Jack the Ripper. They race to him, finding he has destroyed his vampire lover. As they leave with him in custody, they encounter Dravot, and the destroyed body of Godalming. Seward is murdered, but then Dravot produces a fabricated story about what happened: that there were two Rippers. Bemused, Beauregard realizes that he has been used as a tool of the Diogenes Club. Jack Seward, his mind gone, and recognizing Dracula will merely turn him immortal to torture him forever, is mercifully executed by Beauregard. He and Dieudonn\u00e9, by now having become lovers, are to be recognized by the queen for their work. The story concludes with a confrontation between Beauregard, Dieudonn\u00e9, the queen, and Dracula, where Beauregard tosses a silver knife to Queen Victoria at the behest of the Diogenes Club. Knowing that he cannot kill Dracula through direct combat, Beauregard provides Victoria with a means of killing herself, thus depriving Dracula of the right to legally rule Britain and forcing him to flee the country. ==Characters from fiction== Characters are listed here.
