Born in New York City, Purdee was raised primarily in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. Working with the family's production company Karmic Release in his teens, Purdee graduated from the Lehigh Valley Charter High School for the Performing Arts before attending New York's Fordham University. ==Film== While still studying at Fordham, Purdee began work on \"This is Honduras,\" a documentary exploration of life in and around San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the murder capital of the world.

In 2015 it was announced on YouTube that Purdee was organizing the preservation and potential re-release of several documentaries directed by Lee Grant. Ahead of Grant's appearance at the 2017 Turner Classic Movies film festival, The Hollywood Reporter and LA Times reported that Grant and Purdee had co-directed a short YouTube video highlighting the public mistreatment of Hillary Clinton at the hands of her male opponents during the 2016 presidential campaign. Later that year it was announced that Karmic Release Ltd. had begun production on Killian & the Comeback Kids, a musical film written and directed by Purdee, starring Taylor and Nathan Purdee, Kassie DePaiva, John Donchak, Shane Andries, and Shannon O'Boyle. Shot entirely on location in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania the film features an original soundtrack created by Purdee's folk-rock group The Cumberland Kids.

He has voiced radio ad campaigns for At&T;, Bank of America, Ragu, and Spam. He has created documentary content on film history for NBC Universal, focusing on subjects like Peter Biskind, Kirk Douglas, Warren Beatty, and Lee Grant. Most recently he and Karmic Release Ltd. co-produced an acclaimed documentary short for Kino Lorber's blu-ray re-release of Hal Ashby's Academy Award nominated debut film The Landlord. ==COVID-19== Purdee served as the curator for a collection of documentary films directed by Lee Grant which was re-released theatrically for the first time in late 2019, beginning as part of a retrospective on Grant's work at New York's Film Forum.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/nyc-this-weekend-film- series.html The extended life of the documentary collection in theaters was cut short by theater closures at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak. Purdee was asked to reimagine the series as one of the earliest examples of a virtual cinema release. Adding a series of program notes and new or unreleased interviews with Grant, as well as excerpts from the Kirk Douglas archive, the series was renamed 20th Century Woman: The Documentary Films of Lee Grant. It became the \"first virtual repertory series\"https://www.wbur.org/artery/2020/04/24/coolidge-corner-theatres- virtual-screening-room-spotlights-lee-grants-documentaries and received critical praise for bringing Grant's films back into the public eye and highlighting the plight of independent movie theaters during the crisis. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/01/arts/once-blacklisted-lee-grant-went- win-oscars-make- documentaries/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/as-a-casualty-of- the-mccarthy-era-lee-grant-was-afraid-to-talk-not- anymore/2020/07/30/01545768-d272-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.htmlhttps://www.pbs.org/video/actor- and-director-lee-grant-lindon-beckford-and- more-c8lmtn/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/what-to-stream- three-online-releases-of-movies-that-would-have-come-to-theatres In August 2020 Playbill announced that Hope Runs High would release Purdee's musical film Killian & the Comeback Kids as one of the first new films and only independents to return exclusively to American theaters during the crisis.https://www.playbill.com/article/killian-the-comeback-kids-with-taylor- a-purdee-kassie-depaiva-shannon-oboyle-more-eyes-summer-release ==Music== Purdee began playing folk music and busking in the parks and subways of New York City. This quickly coalesced into a duo with scientist and songwriter Liam Higgins, a childhood friend.
