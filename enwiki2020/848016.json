The party is an observer member of the Africa Liberal Network. ==History== The UPND was established in December 1998 and was initially led by Anderson Mazoka, who had left the Movement for Multi- Party Democracy (MMD) shortly beforehand.Tom Lansford (2014) Political Handbook of the World 2014, CQ Press, p1615 Mazoka was the party's presidential candidate for the 2001 general elections, finishing second with 27% of the vote, less than 2% behind the winner Levy Mwanawasa of the MMD. In the National Assembly elections the UPND won 49 seats, becoming the second largest party after the MMD.
