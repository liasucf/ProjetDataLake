    "text": "The Lawrence Tree is a painting by Georgia O'Keeffe in 1929 of a large ponderosa pine tree on the D. H. Lawrence Ranch in Taos County, New Mexico. The tree still survives (as of 2016), and may be visited at the Lawrence Ranch. ==Background== D. H. Lawrence and Frieda Lawrence lived in a cabin near the tree, under which the author sat on a weathered bench and wrote on a table. ==Overview== In 1929, O'Keeffe stayed with Mabel Dodge Luhan, who was a patroness who brought modernists to the Taos art colony. While there she visited the ranch and painted the tree. The perspective was captured by lying down on the bench and looking into the night sky through the branches of the tree. Because of the perspective, it could be hung different ways. It is displayed upside down on the website for the Wadsworth Atheneum, who owns the painting. ==References== Category:1929 paintings Category:Paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe Category:Paintings in the Wadsworth Atheneum ",
