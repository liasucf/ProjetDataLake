The album contains Taha\u2019s song \"Voil\u00e0 Voil\u00e0\", which was released as a dance-oriented single that was a hit with English DJs; and his version of Ya Rayah, the classic cha\u00e2bi song composed by Dahmane El Harrachi (real name Abderrahmane Amrani). Taha returns to these songs in later albums. A video clip was later made for \"Ya Rayah\" Taha and Bruno Maman co- wrote \"Indie (1+1+1)\", which was released as a single in 1995 and for which a video clip was also made. ==Track listing== # Yamess # Malika # Voil\u00e0 Voil\u00e0 # Hitiste # D'Abord D'Abord # Indie (Instrumental) # Hasard # Dinaha # Ya Rayah # Woulla # Menek # Laisse Moi # Yamess (Instrumental) # Voil\u00e0 Voil\u00e0 (Justin Robertson Vocal Edit) # Indie (Vocal Version/ 1+1+1...) ==Personnel== * Rachid Taha - Programming, Vocals * Steve Hillage - Bass, Effects, Guitar, Keyboards, Mixing, Producer, Programming * Nabil Khalidi - Banjo, Bendire, Oud, Percussion, Programming * Pete Davies - Keyboards, Piano * Hossam Ramzy - Percussion * Jah Wobble - Bass * Geoff Richardson - Cello, Viola, Violin * Justin Robertson - Producer, Remixing * Aniff Cousins - Vocals * Blair Booth - Vocals * Bruno Maman - Vocals * Miquette Giraudy - Background vocals * Pinise Saul - Background vocals * Pepsi DeMacque - Background vocals * Rachel Des Bois - Background vocals * Satya Sai - Background vocals * Sonti Mndebele - Background vocals Source: ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1993 albums Category:Rachid Taha albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Hillage ",
