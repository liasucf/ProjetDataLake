    "text": "The Unknown God or Agnostos Theos () is a theory by Eduard Norden first published in 1913 that proposes, based on the Christian Apostle Paul's Areopagus speech in Acts , that in addition to the twelve main gods and the innumerable lesser deities, ancient Greeks worshipped a deity they called \"Agnostos Theos\"; that is: \"Unknown God\", which Norden called \"Un-Greek\". In Athens, there was a temple specifically dedicated to that god and very often Athenians would swear \"in the name of the Unknown God\" ( Ne ton Agnoston).Pseudo-Lucian, Philopatris, 9.14 Apollodorus, PhilostratusPhilostratus, Vita Apollonii 6.3 and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.Pausanias' Description of Greece in 6 vols, Loeb Classic Library, Vol I, Book I.1.4 == Paul at Athens == Saint Paul delivering the Areopagus Sermon in Athens, by Raphael, 1515. According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affairPlutarch's Lives), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech: > Acts 17:22-31 (WEB): 22 Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, > \u201cYou men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things. 23 > For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found > also an altar with this inscription: \u2018TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.\u2019 What therefore you > worship in ignorance, this I announce to you. 24 The God who made the world > and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn\u2019t dwell in > temples made with hands, 25 neither is he served by men\u2019s hands, as though > he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all > things. 26 He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the > surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the > boundaries of their dwellings, 27 that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps > they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each > one of us. 28 \u2018For in him we live, and move, and have our being.\u2019 As some of > your own poets have said, \u2018For we are also his offspring.\u2019 29 Being then the > offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, > or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man. 30 The times of > ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people > everywhere should repent, 31 because he has appointed a day in which he will > judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which > he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.\u201d Because the Jewish God could not be named, it is possible that Paul's Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be \"the unknown god par excellence\". His listeners may also have understood the introduction of a new god by allusions to Aeschylus' The Eumenides; the irony would have been that just as the Eumenides were not new gods at all but the Furies in a new form, so was the Christian God not a new god but rather the god the Greeks already worshipped as the Unknown God. His audience would also have recognized the quotes in verse 28 as coming from Epimenides and Aratus, respectively. ==Archaeology== Altar to the unknown god. There is an altar dedicated to the unknown God found in 1820 on the Palatine Hill of Rome. It contains an inscription in Latin that says: SEI\u00b7DEO\u00b7SEI\u00b7DEIVAE\u00b7SAC G\u00b7SEXTIVS\u00b7C\u00b7F\u00b7CALVINVSPR DE\u00b7SENATI\u00b7SENTENTIA RESTITVIT Which could be translated into English as: \"Either for a god or a sacred goddess, Caius Sextius Calvinus, son of Gaius, praetor by order of the Senate restored this.\" The altar is currently exhibited in the Palatine Museum. ==Controversy== Sitta Von Reden on the book Greece & Rome mentions traces of worship of 17 foreign deities at Piraeus. It was compatible with the Greek religion and formal to worship foreign gods. There is no text suggesting that one single god will cancel the other ones, that this god will come from Israel or Palestine, and that he's tautological to the openness towards foreign gods as expressed with the \"Unknown God\" cult. That confusion was Paul's invention in order to introduce Christianity from a metaphysical entry point. ==See also== * Si deus si dea * Tloquenahuaque ==Notes== Category:Greek deities Category:Names of God Category:Biblical phrases Category:Christianity in Roman Athens Category:Christianity and Hellenistic religion Category:Deities of classical antiquity Category:Christian terminology Category:Paul the Apostle ==External Links== * Translated by Max Mueller ",
