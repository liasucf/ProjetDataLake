    "text": "Licton Springs neighborhood Licton Springs or North College Park is a neighborhood in the informal Northgate district of North Seattle. It is bounded by Interstate 5 to the east, beyond which is Maple Leaf neighborhood and the Northgate Mall; Aurora Avenue N (SR 99) to the west, beyond which is Greenwood; N 85th Street to the south, beyond which is Green Lake, and N Northgate Way to the north, beyond which is Haller Lake.(1) \"NN-1030S\", \"NN-1040S\".jpg dated 17 June 2002. (2) (3) See heading, \"Note about limitations of these data\". == Licton Springs == Licton Springs, the natural iron spring Licton Springs is both a residential neighborhood and a natural spring at the north end of Licton Springs Park, which has a long history as both a unique recreational spot and a commercial crossroads. The neighborhood, wedged between the busy corridors of Interstate 5 and Aurora Avenue, takes its name from l\u00edq\u2019t\u04d9d (LEEK-teed) or Licton, the Lushootseed (Whulshootseed) Coast Salish word for the reddish mud of the springs--. The D _kh_ w\u2019Duw\u2019Absh, People of the Inside and Xacuab\u0161, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the springs area as a spiritual health spa since the area was populated after the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago). In the 1850s, the D _kh_ w\u2019Duw\u2019Absh and Xacuab\u0161 became the Duwamish tribe of today. In October 2019, the spring and the park that surrounds it were designated a city landmark, the first Native cultural site to be so designated. == Settlement == Seattle pioneer David Denny built a summer cabin near the springs around 1870. The natural spring fed Green Lake before it was capped and drained to the Metro sewer system after it became contaminated by residential development (1920, 1931). The Olmsted Brothers designed a park for Licton Springs, as part of a grand streets and parks plan for Seattle (1930s), but this park was never implemented. A park does exist today (where Woodlawn Avenue curves to connect with N 95th Street) in which the spring is located.Licton Springs Park Licton Springs Park Homepage In the mid-1960s restoration began with bond issues and increasing volunteer assistance, resulting in a small pond and natural wetland vegetation as well as urban park amenities.Sheridan & Tobin, Wilma, ed. A Native American presence continues in the neighborhood through the Indian Heritage School at Wilson-Pacific. This school hosts frequent Indian Pow Wows and spectacular wall murals by Indian artist Andrew Morrison.

The trolleys became a part of everyday life and development of residential neighborhoods around trolley stops. Running on a narrow right-of-way through backyards, the whistle became part of the atmosphere of neighborhoods like Licton Springs. In the early years, the line ran through cut forest and rural farms. A few sawmills along the way gave the line a business hauling lumber. The rough wagon road became Aurora Avenue N (1930) after being paved with brick (1913) and asphalt (1928). A most distinctive early feature was the motorist \"tourist camps\", \"auto camps\", and later, \"auto courts\", then the now-familiar motels. One or two still remained at the turn of the 21st century. The Pilling family had a dairy farm (1909\u20131933), out of which grew the waterfowl habitat and birding site of Pilling's Pond today.Walter & local Audubon chapters Japanese-Americans had greenhouses and small farms until they were abruptly forcibly removed with the Japanese American Internment (1942\u20131945). == North College Park == Seattle annexed most of North Seattle in 1954.(1) Phelps, pp. 220-224. (2) Sheridan & Tobin North College Park became defined with the Licton Springs neighborhood with the establishment of North Seattle Community College (1970). Facing NW. Soon after 2006 renovation Licton Springs and the Sunny Walter- Pillings Pond are part of the Densmore Drainage Basin. The springs at the North Police Precinct and North Seattle Community College are headwaters of the south fork of Thornton Creek; this fork flows through culverts under I-5 and the south lot of Northgate Mall development.Bowditch, Wang, & Wilson These neighborhoods are natural extensions of Maple Leaf downstream.Brokaw Neighborhood activists and North Seattle Community College (NSCC) have been promoting habitat restoration in support.(1) Hodson (2) NSCC grounds have a nationally-recognized native habitat, a pentimento of restored native species on a palimpsest of former 1940s suburb, former dairy farm, former bog where native Dkhw\u2019Duw\u2019Absh harvested cranberries.Dolan & True, pp. 242-7. == See also == *Aurora Commons *Thornton Creek *Northgate district of neighborhoods *Pilling's Pond == Notes and references == == Bibliography == * * See heading, \"Note about limitations of these data\". * Elise Bowditch, Teaching Assistant; Man Wang, Teaching Assistant; Matthew W.
