    "text": "The LJ Hooker League is a cricket competition on the NSW Far North Coast comprising teams from the Ballina, Casino, Lismore and Tweed District Cricket Associations. The League was established in 1994/95 and superseded the top- grade of the Ballina, Casino and Lismore District Competitions. After 13 seasons, in 2007 the Tweed District Cricket Association asked to join the league to form a larger 16-team competition. The Ballina clubs voted unanimously to join with the Tweed based clubs, but this was rejected by some Lismore-based teams. The league now comprises teams from Ballina, Casino, Lismore and Tweed districts since 2007/08. Through the Far North Coast Cricket Council (region) and North Coastal Zone (zone), the LJ Hooker League feeds into Country Cricket New South Wales. ==Premiers== *1994/95: Northern Districts *1995/96: Ballina Bears *1996/97: Marist Brothers *1997/98: Southern Districts *1998/99: Casino Cavaliers *1999/00: Casino Cavaliers *2000/01: Tintenbar-East Ballina *2001/02: Alstonville *2002/03: Tintenbar-East Ballina *2003/04: Southern Districts *2004/05: Southern Districts *2005/06: Tintenbar- East Ballina *2006/07: Southern Districts *2007/08: Casino Cavaliers *2008/09: Ballina Bears *2009/10: Casino Cavaliers *2010/11: Casino Cavaliers *2011/12: Ballina Bears and Casino Cavaliers (joint premiers as final washed-out) *2012/13: Cudgen *2013/14: Ballina Bears *2014/15: Cudgen *2015/16: Cudgen *2016/17: Alstonville *2017/18: Cudgen *2018/19: Cudgen *2019/20: Cudgen ==Player of the Year== The following players have been named as Player of the Year: *1994/95: Stuart Fielder (Marist Brothers) *1995/96: Bruce Jobson (Eastern Districts) *1996/97: Chris Matthews (Marist Brothers) and Shane Jacobs (Ballina Bears) *1997/98: Robert Parks (Brunswick-Byron), Stephen Ryan (Brunswick Byron) and Brett Crawford (Tintenbar-East Ballina) *1998/99: Steve Lockhart (Casino Cavaliers) *1999/00: Neil Hancock (Casino Cavaliers), Michael Holt(Northern Districts), Al Nowlan (Casino Cavaliers) and Scott Thompson (Brunswick Byron) *2000/01: Mark Bratti (Casino Cavaliers) *2001/02: Al Nowlan (Eastern Districts) *2002/03: Phil Alley (Tintenbar-East Ballina), Michael Nind (Southern Districts) *2003/04: Brett Crawford (Tintenbar-East Ballina) *2004/05: Bruce Jobson (Eastern Districts), Paul McLean (Southern Districts) *2005/06: Brett Crawford (Tintenbar-East Ballina) *2006/07: Paul McLean (Southern Districts) *2007/08: Brett Crawford (Tintenbar-East Ballina) *2008/09: Jason Caught (Lismore Workers) *2009/10: Jack Boote (South Tweed) *2010/11: Sam Adams (Ballina Bears) *2011/12: Sam Adams (Ballina Bears) *2012/13: Sam Adams (Ballina Bears) *2013/14: Greg Potter Alstonville *2014/15: Caleb Ziebell (Cudgen) *2015/16: Abe Crawford (Tintenbar-East Ballina) *2016/17: Caleb Ziebell (Cudgen) *2017/18: Caleb Ziebell (Cudgen) *2018/19: Caleb Ziebell (Cudgen) and Will Chapples (Murwillumbah) *2019/20: Jason Caught (Lismore Workers) ==References== Category:Australian domestic cricket competitions Category:Northern Rivers ",
