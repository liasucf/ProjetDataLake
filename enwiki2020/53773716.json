It was the sequel to Gardes- Marines, ahead! and was followed by Gardes-Marines-III. ==Plot== Russia, 1744. Empress Elizabeth is childless and increasingly ill. Her nephew, Tsarevich Petr Fedorovich, the son of Anna, Elizabeth's elder sister, is appointed as heir. This is a quarrelsome, foolish young man who from an early age became familiar with alcohol and tobacco. In order to strengthen the dynasty, Elizabeth decides to arrange the marriage of her good for nothing nephew, offering him one of the German princesses as a bride, Sophie Friederike Auguste, who by virtue of her young age is affectionately called \"Fiquet\". Vice-chancellor Bestuzhev summons Aleksei Korsak and Alexander Belov and gives them an important assignment. Friends should hand over a personal letter to Prince Anhalt-Zerbst, and then deliver \"Fiquet\" and her mother incognito to St. Petersburg. On the way to their homeland, their third friend, Nikita Olenev, unexpectedly joins them, who at that time was studying in Germany. True friends Gardes-Marines are together again, and they are bringing a precious cargo with them to the distant snow-covered Russia: the future wife of the heir to the throne and her mother. But such political action can not go unnoticed in Europe. French diplomacy starts another intrigue, and Chevalier de Brillieu again is its tool. Using his skill of a clever Don Juan, de Brillieu should become the lover and confidant of Fiquet's mother - the duchess Johanna, a lustful and extravagant woman, up to her neck in debt. Then acting through the duchess, France will be able to influence the heir and his wife in its own interests. De Brillieu takes up the work with ardor because personal animosity is involved. After all it was the Gardes-Marines who stole Anastasia Yaguzhinskaya away from him, a Russian beauty whom the Frenchman still loves. And now de Brillieu prepares a trap, which must include friends and Gardes-Marines, and \"Fiquet\" with her mother... ==Cast== * Dmitry Kharatyan \u2013 Aleksei Korsak, Gardes-Marine * Sergey Zhigunov \u2013 Aleksandr Belov, Gardes-Marine (voice by Aleksandr Domogarov) * Mikhail Mamaev \u2013 Nikita Olenev, Gardes-Marine (voice by Andrey Gradov) * Mikhail Boyarsky \u2013 Chevalier de Brillieu * Tatyana Lyutaeva \u2013 Anastasia Yaguzhinskaya (voice by Anna Kamenkova) * Kristina Orbakait\u0117 \u2013 Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, \"Fiquet\", future Empress Catherine the Great * Vladimir Soshalsky \u2013 Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, Fiquet's father * Lyudmila Gurchenko \u2013 Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, Fiquet's mother * Natalya Gundareva \u2013 Elizabeth of Russia * Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev \u2013 Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, Vice-Chancellor * Mikhail Yefremov \u2013 crown prince Pyotr Fyodorovich * Sergei Nikonenko \u2013 Count Peter Chernyshev, Russian Ambassador to Prussia * Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina \u2013 \u0421ourtier Ekaterina Chernysheva, Russian Ambassador's wife * Paul Butkevich \u2013 Frederick the Great (voice by Innokenty Smoktunovsky) * Leonid Satanovskiy \u2013 Ober-Hofmarshal Brummer * Olga Mashnaya \u2013 Sophia Korsak, Aleksei's wife * Sergey Migitsko \u2013 Jacques-Joachim Trotti, marquis de La Ch\u00e9tardie * Vladimir Balon \u2013 Jacques, de Brillieu's servant * Viktor Bortsov \u2013 Gavrila, Olenev's servant * Aleksey Vanin \u2013 Ivan, guard ==Soundtrack== *\"Do not hang your nose!\" (\u041d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0441!) \u2013 Dmitry Kharatyan and Aleksandr Domogarov *\"Dove (Lanfren-lanfra)\" (\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430 (\u041b\u0430\u043d\u0444\u0440\u0435\u043d-\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0444\u0440\u0430) \u2013 Mikhail Boyarsky *\"Song of the Cricket\" (\u041f\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0435) \u2013 Kristina Orbakait\u0117 ==Filming== * Filming took place in the winter of 1989-1990 in the museum-estate \"Kuskovo\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 films Category:Soviet films Category:1990s historical adventure films Category:Soviet historical adventure films Category:Russian-language films Category:Russian sequel films Category:Russian films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Swashbuckler films Category:Films set in the Russian Empire ",
