Jimmy and Tommy Swarbrigg had previously represented Ireland in 1975, and were joined on this occasion by Alma Carroll and Nicola Kerr. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === The final was held at the studios of broadcaster RT\u00c9 in Dublin, hosted by Mike Murphy. Eight songs took part, with the winner chosen by voting from ten regional juries. Other participants included past and future Irish representatives Dickie Rock (1966) and Colm C. T. Wilkinson (1978), while future Eurovision winner Linda Martin performed as a member of the group Chips.ESC National Finals database 1977 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text- align:center\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Pre-contest betting rated Ireland as one of the front runners, along with the entries from Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. At the close of voting \"It's Nice to Be in Love Again\" had picked up 119 points, placing Ireland third of the 18 entries, the country's best placement since Dana's victory seven years earlier. The song had gained four maximum 12s - from Israel, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom - with only Finland failing to award it any points at all. It was therefore somewhat ironic that the Irish jury awarded its 12 points to Finland.ESC History - Ireland 1977 ==See also== *Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1977 == References == Category:1977 in Irish music Category:1977 in Irish television Category:1977 in Ireland Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977 Category:Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest ",
