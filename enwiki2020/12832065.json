Meanwhile, there are bar fights, some mean smugglers, and F\u00edgaro and Wearisome discover a deep, dark secret about Don Crist\u00f3bal. He gave it the subtitle \"Tragi-comedy of Don Crist\u00f3bal and Miss Rosita: A Guignolesque farce in six scenes and an announcement.\"Garc\u00eda Lorca (1970, 21).
