It is named after Apolinario Mabini, a Filipino revolutionary hero. ==History== 2018 stamp of the Philippines dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Mabini Legend states that the first Malay settlers to inhabit the vast fertile land bordering the two bodies of water now known as the Batangas Bay and the Balayan Bay, first found anchor along the shores of the land protruding down Southwest ward known geographically as the Calumpan Peninsula. These Malay settlers found the land fertile and agriculturally appropriate and the sea rich in marine resources. They established their settlement in this once vast unknown land. As more Malay settlers arrived from distant lands, more settlements were founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their own form of village government. They were ruled by a headman, a datu, or a sultan, in case of big encampments. Malay civilization began to take roots. Rapid increase of population brought about the settlements of all the neighboring regions, that it did not take long before several nearby regions were inhabited later on to comprise the whole province of Kumintang, better known later as Batangas. During the Spanish colonial rule, the Calumpan Peninsula was made a part of the pueblo of Bauan, in the province of Kumintang. The same peninsula territory of Bauan was subdivided into barrios: Mainaga, Pulong-Niogan, Pulong-Balibaguhan, Anilao, Solo, Pulong-Anahao, Bagalangit, Nag-Iba, Malimatoc, Saguing and Talaga. For more than three hundred years, while the Archipelago was under Spanish domination, the peninsula remained a part of the \u201cpueblo\u201d of Bauan even until the early part of the American occupation. The people of this peninsula, like other people of other regions, suffered untold hardships under the Spanish rule. The yoke of the Spanish tyranny was thrown off after the gallant uprising of 1896. The revolution emancipated the people from the tyrants of Spain. Foremost of the heroic young men was Don Francisco Castillo, known as Apian Kiko, who led the fight for freedom in this peninsula. After efforts had been exerted by the proponents of establishing a new municipality independent of the town of Bauan, eleven (11) barrios of the Calumpan Peninsula and the whole of the Maricaban Island was declared an independent municipality, with the name Mabini, derived from the Philippine hero Apolinario Mabini. The new- born municipality of Mabini was inaugurated on January 1, 1918, with Captain Francisco Castillo, known as the founder of the town, as the first appointive Municipal President.CENTENNIAL OF MABINI, BATANGAS. phlpost.gov.ph (February 20, 2018) ==Geography== According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas. ===Barangays=== Mabini is politically subdivided into 34 barangays.
