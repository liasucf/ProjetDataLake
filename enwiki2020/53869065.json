    "text": "Fiona Hill (born October 1965) is a British-American foreign affairs specialist and academic. She is a former official at the U.S. National Security Council specializing in Russian and European affairs. She was a witness in the November 2019 House hearings regarding the impeachment of President Trump. A PhD in history from Harvard University, she is currently a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ==Early life and education == Hill was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham in northern England, the daughter of a coal miner, Alfred Hill, and a midwife, June Murray. Her father died in 2012; her mother still lives in Bishop Auckland. In the 1960s, as many of the local coal mines were closing, her father wanted to emigrate to find work in the mines of Pennsylvania or West Virginia, but his mother's poor health required him to stay in England. Her family struggled financially; June sewed clothes for her daughters and at age 13, Fiona began working at odd jobs, including washing cars and working as a waitress at a local hotel. She and her sister attended Bishop Barrington School, a local comprehensive school. In 2017, she recalled applying for the University of Oxford: \"I applied to Oxford in the '80s and was invited to an interview. It was like a scene from Billy Elliot: people were making fun of me for my accent and the way I was dressed. It was the most embarrassing, awful experience I had ever had in my life.\" She then studied history and Russian at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In 1987, she was an exchange student in the Soviet Union, where, while interning for NBC News, she witnessed the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. An American professor encouraged Hill to apply for a graduate program in the United States. On the experience, in 2003, Hill wrote in The Siberian Curse, \"I noticed that many aspects of British (and, by relation, American) culture were surprisingly, even unexpectedly similar, and that the Russians and the West had a good deal in common. Before long, other aspects of the Soviet and Russian [...] mentalities and cultures reared their heads, and these gaps seemed larger and more consuming than any novel or textbook could transmit\". Continuing in another passage, she writes, \"Whether or not these gaps can be effectively bridged or, at least, mitigated will remain the guiding question for this field of study for decades to come\". Hill seemed to answer this question for herself in 2020, when she cowrote an op-ed in Politico Magazine, along with Jon Huntsman Jr, Robert Legvold, Rose Gottemoeller, and Thomas R. Pickering, wherein they state that, although Russia is and will likely remain greatly disharmonious with Western Europe and North America, it is in the security interests of the United States to seek cooperation where possible. At Harvard University, she earned a master's degree in Russian and modern history in 1991, and a PhD in history in 1998 under Richard Pipes, Akira Iriye, and Roman Szporluk. While at Harvard, she was a Frank Knox Fellow, and met her future husband, Kenneth Keen, at Cabot House. Hill became a US citizen in 2002. ==Career== Hill worked in the research department at the John F. Kennedy School of Government from 1991 to 1999, and at the National Intelligence Council as a national intelligence analyst of Russia and Eurasia from 2006 to 2009. In 2017, she took a leave of absence from the Brookings Institution, where she was director for the Center on the United States and Europe, while also on the National Security Council. Hill is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the board of trustees of the Eurasia Foundation. In 1999, Hill was director of Harvard University's Strengthening Democratic Institutions project. Hill was an intelligence analyst under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama from 2006 to 2009. She was appointed, in the first quarter of 2017, by President Donald Trump as Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs on his National Security Council staff. Hill had been due to leave the White House to return to Brookings in April 2019. She developed a close working relationship with National Security Advisor John Bolton, and at Bolton's request Hill agreed to stay on until mid July, when Tim Morrison would replace her. As planned, Hill left the White House on July 15th, ten days before the Trump-Zelensky phone call. Hill has subsequently spoken of the difficulty of maintaining a consistent US-Russia policy under President Trump, a result of the clash of her \"hawkish\" view on Russia and Trump's intermittently warm and welcoming approach, and of the difficulty of ascertaining what Trump and Putin discussed in private meetings. She experienced hostility from Republicans, including Connie Mack who described Hill as a \"George Soros mole infiltrating the national-security apparatus\". In her post-White House career, Hill returned to academic work, albeit with a more public profile. Her views on Russia could be characterized by increasing pessimism on cooperation with the United States, as she expresses fear that even Russia's foremost oppositional politician, Alexei Navalny, employs populism and has a history of engaging nationalism.https://www.international.ucla.edu/burkle/multimediatranscript/229723 Hill believes that, in the context of Russia's resurgent international adventurism, Navalny's political potential does not augur well with the United States' national security interests.

She testified in public before the same body on November 21, 2019. While being questioned by Steve Castor, the counsel for the House Intelligence Committee's Republican minority, Hill commented on Gordon Sondland's involvement in the Ukraine matter: \"It struck me when (Wednesday), when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland's emails, and who was on these emails, and he said these are the people who need to know, that he was absolutely right,\" she said. \"Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged.\" In response to a question from that committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, Hill stated: \"The Russians\u2019 interests are frankly to delegitimize our entire presidency.\u2026 The goal of the Russians [in 2016] was really to put whoever became the president \u2014 by trying to tip their hands on one side of the scale \u2014 under a cloud.\" (Italicizing of the word \u201cwhoever\u201d denotes Hill\u2019s own verbal emphasis.) ==Selected works== Hill's books include: * * * ==See also== *Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal *Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1965 births Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:American anti-communists Category:American historians Category:21st-century American historians Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Living people Category:George W.
