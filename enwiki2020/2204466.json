The road is named after Flamingo Las Vegas which is located on Las Vegas Boulevard near where it intersects with Flamingo Road. ==Route description== View at the west end of SR 592 looking eastbound in 2015 The first portion of SR 592 begins at Rainbow Boulevard (SR 595) and extends easterly to Interstate 15. The second section resumes at Paradise Road and continues east, skirting the northern edge of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) campus before reaching its terminus at Boulder Highway (SR 582). ==History== Western half of Flamingo Road from the Strip to I-215 in 2006 Flamingo Road near Caesars Palace in 2012 Flamingo Road and Hotel Rio Drive intersection in 2012 Flamingo Road near The Platinum condo hotel in 2012 Flamingo Road originally was called Monson Road, and only existed east of Las Vegas Boulevard, with a nearby street, Dunes Road connecting Las Vegas Boulevard with Interstate 15 (I-15). In the early 1980s, the Nevada Department of Transportation rebuilt the Dunes interchange at I-15, and constructed a six-lane Flamingo Road west to Rainbow Boulevard. The segment between I-15 and Las Vegas Boulevard remained named Dunes-Flamingo Road until 1995. The portion of SR 592 between I-15 and Paradise Road was decommissioned by 2008. The route is a candidate to be decommissioned with control given to Clark County; however, only the above section located in the resort corridor has been relinquished as of January 2008. ==Major intersections== ==Attractions== *Palms Casino Resort *Gold Coast Hotel and Casino *Bellagio (resort) *Caesars Palace *Bally's Las Vegas *The Cromwell Las Vegas *Desert Springs Hospital ==Public transport== RTC Transit Route 202 functions on this road. ==See also== * * ==References== Category:Streets in the Las Vegas Valley ",
