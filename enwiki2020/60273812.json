    "text": "Virginia Peak is a mountain in the northern part of Yosemite National Park, north of Tuolumne Meadows. It is the 25th highest mountain in Yosemite National Park. ==Virginia Peaks's particulars== Virginia Peak is in northeastern Yosemite National Park, on a north-south ridge splitting off the main Sierra crest at Twin Peaks. Virginia Pass and Sawtooth Ridge are near, as are Whorl Mountain, Excelsior Mountain and Matterhorn Peak. Near Virginia Pass, viewed from the east, Virginia Peak looks dark, forbidding -- it is not composed of more-common Yosemite granite, but of reddish metamorphic rock, such as is found on Mount Dana and Dunderberg Peak. Of note, Virginia Peak is along the ancient boundary between the Sierra Nevada Batholith's intruding granite and pre-existing sediments, which are now metamorphosed, so-called metasediments. ==References== ==External links and references== * A topographic map of the area Category:Mountains of Yosemite National Park Category:Mountains of Tuolumne County, California Category:Landforms of Yosemite National Park ",
