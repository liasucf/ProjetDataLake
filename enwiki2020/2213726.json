    "text": "is a racing video game developed by Sega and AM1 and released in Japan, Europe, and North America in 1992 . It constitutes the third release in the arcade OutRun series and was ported to the Mega Drive in 1994. ==Description== OutRunners two-player cabinet OutRunners is the fourth game in the Out Run series, following Battle Out Run and Turbo Outrun. After Turbo Outrun's departure from Out Run's laid-back, charming atmosphere, fans wanted a game that captured the spirit of the original. OutRunners succeeded in doing this; it brought back the ability to take different paths through forks in the road, returned to a lighthearted atmosphere, and distanced itself well from the \"serious\" Turbo Outrun. The game featured head-to-head support, and with enough cabinets, up to eight players could challenge each other. It was also the only game in the Out Run series to feature various selectable cars and multiple endings until OutRun 2. OutRunners was the most successful game released for Sega's System Multi 32 hardware, and one of the last successful 2D games released by Sega. OutRunners was also known for having some of the best looking graphics seen at the time, thanks to creative sprite design and a very skillful use of parallax scrolling, similar to that found in Power Drift, released four years earlier. The game holds up very well today, and plays very similarly to a modern polygon based 3D racer, something not common in a racing game that utilises 2D graphics. Some routes are accessible on more than one route combination like in the original Out Run. After the initial starting stage, the player has the option of either turning east or west. West leads through San Francisco, through the Easter Islands, into Asia and either into Africa or Europe. East goes through the Grand Canyon, South America or Niagara Falls, across the Atlantic Ocean, into Europe and either into Asia or Australia. An anthropomorphic broad bean character is featured on billboards and the start of the game called \"Broad Bean,\" a parody of Bibendum (the Michelin man), presumably the mascot of the fictional company sponsoring the race, Sam Spree. In the Mega Drive version, both Sonic and Tails may fly by in a pair of Tornados and sprinkle the Sega logo onto the screen. Sonic can also be seen on various billboards in the first stage. All of the selectable cars in OutRunners are fictional convertibles, but bear resemblance to real automobiles. Notably, the Speed Buster closely resembles the Ferrari Testarossa featured in the original OutRun. Each car has its own set of a driver and passenger character, and have their own unique ending vignette if the player makes it to a goal. Each character set also has their own way of acting when their car crashes (Flying through the air, bouncing like balls, running after the car, etc.), but unlike their OutRun counterparts, they always land right back in the car and keep going without stopping. ==Development== OutRunners features all four of the songs from the original OutRun by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, as well as various new tracks composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi and Takayuki Nakamura, along with contributions from Kawaguchi. == Release == A port of the game was released for the Mega Drive by Sega and for the Genesis by Data East. It featured a forced split-screen in single player modes, where one screen focused on the player and the other on the AI. Though the graphics were merely an adaptation of the arcade version, all other features of this version were kept intact, such as the original arcade soundtrack featuring four songs from the original Outrun. Andy Dyer wrote in Mega that it was \"the most embarrassing driving game to appear on the Mega Drive.\" In October 1993, Atari Corporation filed a lawsuit against Sega for an alleged infringement of a patent originally created by Atari Corp. in the 1980s, with the former seeking a preliminary injunction to stop manufacturing, usage and sales of hardware and software for both Sega Genesis and Game Gear. On September 28, 1994, both parties reached a settlement in which it involved a cross-licensing agreement to publish up to five titles each year across their systems until 2001. The Genesis version of OutRunners was one of the first five titles approved from the deal by Sega in order to be converted for the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed OutRunners on their July 1, 1993 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== *OutRunners at Killer List of Videogames * Category:1992 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:Easter Island in fiction Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:OutRun Category:Racing video games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega System 32 games Category:Split- screen multiplayer games Category:WOW Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi Category:Video games scored by Takayuki Nakamura Category:Video games set in Africa Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Video games set in China Category:Video games set in Easter Island Category:Video games set in Egypt Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Hong Kong Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Hawaii Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Russia Category:Video games set in South America Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Video games set in the United States ",
