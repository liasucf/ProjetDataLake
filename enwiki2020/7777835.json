    "text": "1864 was the 78th season of cricket in England (since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)). It was a significant year in cricket history, as it saw the legalisation of overarm bowling and the first edition of John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Almanac. ==Inter-county cricket== The first-class county teams in 1864 were: Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Notts, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire. The unofficial concept of a \"champion county\" took a new turn when periodicals began publishing tables of inter-county results, although there was still no formal or agreed method of deciding positions in the table. Haygarth usually refers to 'generally agreed' when announcing the Champion County.First Class Cricket Matches 1864 - ACS - Nottingham {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" |+ TableTable of inter-county results according to Rowland Bowen: see CricInfo ! width=10 | ! width=100 | Team ! width=20 | P ! width=20 | W ! width=20 | L ! width=20 | D !
