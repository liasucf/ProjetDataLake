    "text": "Protection is the second studio album by English electronic music group Massive Attack, released on 26 September 1994 through Circa and Virgin Records. DJ Mad Professor remixed the album in 1995 under the name No Protection. ==Composition== Like most of Massive Attack's albums, the music often defies categorisation, ranging from R&B; (title track and \"Sly\") to hip hop/rap (\"Karmacoma\" and \"Eurochild\") to reggae-tinged synthpop (\"Spying Glass\") to classical-influenced electronica instrumentals (\"Weather Storm\" and \"Heat Miser\"). The album follows Blue Lines structurally, to the point that the font used on the cover of the album is the same, Helvetica Heavy Italic. The album cover also nods to Blue Lines, revealing a futuristic, impenetrable wall behind a mostly-burned version of this previous album's artwork- implying that the depicted \"flammable gas\" had been ignited. Tricky again appeared on the album, rapping on the tracks \"Karmacoma\" (whose video was directed by Jonathan Glazer, and which featured a sample from The KLF's \"Dream Time in Lake Jackson\" at the 2:00 minute mark) and \"Eurochild\" (which featured samples from Startled Insects' \"Cheetah\" and Liquid Liquid's \"Lock Groove (In)\"). ==Reception== Paul Evans of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Cool, sexy stuff, it smoothly fuses dub, club and soul, grounding its grace in sampled hip-hop beats.\" In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked Protection at number 51 on its list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Nineties\". The album is also listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. As of 2010, sales in the United States have exceeded 292,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. ==Track listing== ;Sample credits *\"Weather Storm\" contains samples of \"It's Time for Love\", written by Curtis Harmon, James Lloyd, and Cedric Napoleon, and performed by Pieces of a Dream. *\"Better Things\" contains samples of \"Never Can Say Goodbye\", written and performed by James Brown. *\"Eurochild\" contains samples of \"Blank Expression\", written by John Bradbury, Roderick Byers, Jeremy Dammers, Lynval Golding, Terry Hall, Stephen Panter, and Neville Staples, and performed by The Specials. ==Personnel== *Massive Attack \u2013 producer, mixing, programming, artwork *Nellee Hooper \u2013 producer, mixing *Marius de Vries, Andy Wright, The Insects, Nick Warren \u2013 programming *Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall, Tricky, Tracey Thorn, Horace Andy, Nicolette \u2013 vocals *Craig Armstrong \u2013 piano *Chester Kamen \u2013 guitar *Rob Merril \u2013 drums *Mark \"Spike\" Stent, Jim Abbiss \u2013 mix engineer *Jeremy \"Jim Bob\" Wheatley, Al Stone \u2013 additional engineering *Mike Marsh \u2013 mastering *Michael-Nash Assoc. \u2013 artwork *Matthew Donaldson, Jean Baptiste Mondino, Eddie Monsoon \u2013 photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994\u20132001) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Alternative Albums (Ultratop Flanders) | 46 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media) | 21 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista) | 33 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1994 albums Category:Massive Attack albums Category:Albums produced by Nellee Hooper Category:Chill-out music albums Category:Virgin Records albums ",
