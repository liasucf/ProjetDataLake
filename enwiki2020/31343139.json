    "text": "Coed Cochion Quarry is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Carmarthenshire, Wales, in which the geology of the site has preserved rare Precambrian fossils. ==SSSI== Coed Cochion Quarry SSSI is a very small quarry of located approximately south of Llangynog and north of Llanybri, north-east of the Taf Estuary. The site is a rare example in the world of Precambrian fossil records - greater than 0.5 billion years old - found in the ashy siltstone sedimentary rock. A number of fossils of medusoid creatures - visually like, but maybe not in fact contemporary jellyfish - are present, as are feeding trails of other creatures. The evidence is that the site was once a sandy, silty shoreline in which soft-bodied fauna became buried. ==See also== *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthenshire ==References== ==External links== *SSSI Citation for Coed Cochion Quarry *Citation map for Coed Cochion Quarry *Your Special Site and its Future - Coed Cochion Quarry SSSI overview from Natural Resources Wales *Coed Cochion Quarry SSSI marked on DEFRA's MAGIC Map Category:Quarries in Wales Category:Precambrian fossils Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthen & Dinefwr ",
