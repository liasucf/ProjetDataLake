After merging into the London and North Western Railway, the company became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923.

In addition to its main line calls, the station also served as the terminus of a local service from Crewe via & until 1942. This used a connecting curve that diverged from the main line just north of to join the Cheshire Lines Committee line from to near (this remains in use, but for freight traffic only). When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Railways. Trains of the Intercity Sector passed on the West Coast Main Line. When British Rail was privatised Acton Bridge was served by Central Trains until 2007, then served by London Midland, now London Northwestern. ==Services== Acton Bridge has two trains per hour in weekday peak hours, reducing to one every two hours (with some even longer gaps) outside the peaks, all operated by London Northwestern trains, running between and .
