    "text": "Rudolf Margolius (31 August 1913, Prague \u2013 3 December 1952, Prague) was a Czech politician. Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade, Czechoslovakia (1949\u20131952), and a co-defendant in the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial in November 1952. Imprisoned by the Nazis in the Lodz ghetto and several concentration camps, he survived the Holocaust and joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party, working as an economist. The 1952 show trial involved the Communist Party General Secretary, Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, and his thirteen co-defendants. They were arrested, unjustly accused, tried, and executed as traitors and western spies. The trial was orchestrated by Soviet advisors, sent to Prague by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and assisted by Czechoslovak Secret Service interrogators and the members of Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee. The destruction of the Czechoslovak Communist high-ranking party officials by their own colleagues has defied attempts to rationalize it, and our understanding of the affair remains superficial. One of the people who were thrown into the alleged conspiracy was Dr Rudolf Margolius. The Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd group consisted of many personalities. On one side was Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, an extremist and one of those who helped to usher Czechoslovakia into the Stalinist era. At the centre stood Vladim\u00edr Clementis (Minister of Foreign Affairs), a Communist and one of the conductors of the February 1948 communist coup, but also a man who had dared to criticize the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. On the other extreme of the scale was Margolius. Unlike others in the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd group, he joined the Communist Party late \u2013 in December 1945 \u2013 and acquired faith in socialism as a result of his experience in Adolf Hitler\u2019s concentration campsIgor Lukes (2002): Rudolf Margolius: A Clean Man in a Filthy Time, Boston University 2002 and never held any Party appointments, he was purely an economist.Heda Margoliov\u00e1 Kov\u00e1lyov\u00e1 a Helena T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edkov\u00e1: Hitler, Stalin a j\u00e1: \u00dastn\u00ed historie 20. stolet\u00ed, Mlad\u00e1 fronta, Praha, 2015, p. 176, ==Life== Rudolf Margolius was born in Prague into a patriotic Czech, middle-class milieu. As a law student in the thirties at Charles University, studying together with the Czech poet Hanu\u0161 Bonn, he devoted much of his time to the YMCA travelling in Western Europe, Middle East and America. During Czechoslovakia\u2019s Munich crisis with Nazi Germany he was an Army reservist serving together with his friend, music composer, Jan Hanu\u0161. In 1939, while Czechoslovakia was already occupied by the Third Reich, he married Heda Bloch (later known as Heda Margolius Kov\u00e1ly). In 1941 he was deported to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto and subsequently to concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. In May 1945 after escaping from Dachau, he was made a leader of the Garmisch-Partenkirchen camp for the war refugees. After returning to Prague in June 1945 together with Jarmila \u010capkov\u00e1 Margolius went to Bergen-Belsen to search for Josef \u010capek.Jarmila \u010capkov\u00e1, Vzpom\u00ednky, Torst, Praha 1998, p. 331. In December 1945 he joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party influenced by his war experiences and murder of his parents and relatives in the concentration camps and hope of instituting better future for the country. Between 1945 and 1948 he worked for the Central Federation of Czechoslovak Industry in Prague. Afterwards he was promoted to the Chief of Staff of the Minister for Foreign Trade (1948\u201349) and subsequently became Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade responsible for the sector trading with Western countries (1949\u201352). Together with his colleague, Ev\u017een L\u00f6bl, Margolius was the author of dollar offensive in the Czechoslovak economic policy. In 1949 in London Margolius negotiated and signed several important economic and financial agreements with Ernest Bevin and Sir William Strang who represented the British Government. The agreements through Margolius' effort were weighted in favour of the Czechoslovak trade rather than the British trade.https://soldan.blog.sme.sk/c/228307/Platba-za-krv-II-diel- obdobie-1945-1982.html?ref=viacblogerJan Kukl\u00edk, Do posledn\u00ed pence, Karolinum, Praha 2007, , pp.243-298 Czechoslovak government was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations and requested that the effort of all those who had participated would be appreciated.Jan Kukl\u00edk, Do posledn\u00ed pence, Karolinum, Praha 2007, , pp.286 Margolius was a lawyer and economist and was not directly involved in the contemporary Communist Party machinations or politics.Ivan Margolius, Reflections of Prague: Journeys through the 20th Century, Wiley, Chichester 2006, p. 160 Dr. Rudolf Margolius was arrested on January 10, 1952. After months of physical and psychological coercion in addition to being forced to sign a false confession, Margolius met for the first time his alleged co-inspirators led by Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd at the Czechoslovak High Court attached to the Pankr\u00e1c Prison in Prague in November 1952. Margolius was chosen as a member of the \u2018conspiracy\u2019 because in his capacity as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Foreign Trade he made trade agreements with capitalist countries against the wishes of the Soviet Union to increase trade with other socialist countries and he dealt with large sums of money. These details had a great impact on contemporary public opinion. As had been determined in advance in Moscow and by the Czechoslovak Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, the court sentenced Margolius and ten others to death, three received life sentences. The Times on November 28, 1952 commented: \"The only surprising aspect...is that Margolius...is not among those who have been given the reduced penalty.\" On December 3, 1952, at the execution, Margolius did not pronounce any last words. Pavel Tigrid wrote: \"Margolius\u2026 survived the Nazi concentration camps and after the war enrolled into the Communist Party from the real conviction: that never again would be repeated what had happened in the past, that no one would be persecuted for his or hers racial, national or social origins, in order for all people to be equal, in order to establish an era of real freedom. A couple of years later the comrades succeeded in what the Nazis had not managed: they killed him.\"Pavel Tigrid, Kapesn\u00ed pr\u016fvodce inteligentn\u00ed \u017eeny po vlastn\u00edm osudu, 68 Publishers, Toronto 1988, p. 97. ==Posthumous exoneration== The Scotsman reported on 16 May 1968: > Czechoslovak President Ludv\u00edk Svoboda has awarded the Order of the Republic > posthumously to Rudolf Margolius, former Deputy Foreign Trade Minister > executed in 1952 after the Stalinist Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial.
