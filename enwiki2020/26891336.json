This was a third Eurovision appearance in four contests for Str\u00f8m. ==Before Eurovision== === Melodi Grand Prix 1976 === The final was held at Centralteatret in Oslo, hosted by Jan Voigt. Five songs were presented in the final with each song sung twice by different singers, once with a small combo and once with a full orchestra which was conducted by Helge Hurum. The winning song was chosen by voting from ten regional juries.ESC National Finals database 1976 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"6\" |Final \u2013 7 February 1976 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | Draw ! colspan=\"2\" | Artist ! rowspan=\"2\" | Song ! rowspan=\"2\" | Points ! rowspan=\"2\" | Place |- !Combo !Orchestra |- |1 | align=\"left\" |Jahn Teigen | align=\"left\" |Anita Skorgan | align=\"left\" |\"Hastverk\" (Haste) (H. & K.

It was not expected to challenge for the win as the consensus was that the title would be fought out between France and the United Kingdom, but was widely predicted as likely to give Norway one of its better placements to date. However things did not go to plan, and at the close of voting \"Mata Hari\" had picked up only 7 points (4 from Portugal and 3 from the Netherlands), placing Norway last of the 18 entries, the fourth time the country had finished the evening at the foot of the scoreboard. In the wake of the poor result, it was widely suggested that Str\u00f8m's odd presentation - in which she appeared on stage in a very unflattering pair of sunglasses, which she proceeded at apparently random intervals to remove and wave around and then put back on again - may have been puzzling and distracting for viewers and juries. The Norwegian jury awarded its 12 points to contest winners the United Kingdom.ESC History - Norway 1976 ==See also== *Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1976 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976 Category:Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1976 in Norwegian music Category:1976 in Norwegian television ",
