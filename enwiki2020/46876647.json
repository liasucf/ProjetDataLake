    "text": "Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (also known as Kancabch\u00e9n Rancho) is located in the Motul Municipality in the state of Yucat\u00e1n in southeastern Mexico. It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century henequen boom. There are numerous other properties of this name in the Yucat\u00e1n including Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n in Baca, Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Halach\u00f3), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Hom\u00fan), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Sey\u00e9), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Tixkokob), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Tunk\u00e1s), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n Uc\u00ed and Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n de Valencia. ==Toponymy== The name (Kancabch\u00e9n) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. ==How to get there== Take highway 176 northeast out of M\u00e9rida approximately 33 km to Motul. From the center of Motul, take Calle 26 south to Calle 37 and head east. In approximately 5 blocks the street will veer to the south. Remain on Calle 37 heading towards Kopt\u00e9 for approximately 5 km. At the intersection, turn left and proceed 1 km to Kancabch\u00e9n. ==History== ==Demographics== All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n houses only the owner's immediate family. According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, the population of the city was 360 inhabitants, of whom 181 were men and 179 were women. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |+ Population of Kancabch\u00e9n by year |- !
