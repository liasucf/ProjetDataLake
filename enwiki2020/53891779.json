    "text": "Adad-Nirari or H\u0331addu-Nirari, was a king of Qatna in the 14th century BC. ==Reign== Adad-Nirari is an Akkadian name. The king reigned for 45 years in the 14th century BC, and was mentioned in the inventories of Ninegal, found in Qatna. A tablet from Qatna records him stationing an army of chariot archers in the city of Tukad, in Mount Lebanon. The name of his queen was Pizallum. ===Identity=== Michael Astour suggested identifying Adad-Nirari with Adad- Nirari of Nuha\u0161\u0161e; a hypothesis supported by Thomas Richter, who believes that Adad-Nirari ruled Qatna through a \u0161akkanakku (military governor) called Lullu, citing that the latter's name appears in the Qatanite inventories at the time of Adad-Nirari. According to Richter, Adad-Nirari of Nuha\u0161\u0161e ruled the second Syrian power after Mitanni, and was removed by the Hittites which gave Qatna back its independence. This theory is debated; the Shattiwaza treaty between Mitanni and the Hittites mentioned Qatna independently from Nuha\u0161\u0161e during the Hittite king \u0160uppiluliuma I's first Syrian war; If Qatna was part of the Nuha\u0161\u0161ite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately. Jacques Freu rejected Richter's hypothesis; citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuha\u0161\u0161e was a contemporary of Idadnda of Qatna who ruled during the first Syrian war, a successor of the Qatanite Adad-Nirari. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * * Category:14th-century BC rulers Category:Qatna ",
