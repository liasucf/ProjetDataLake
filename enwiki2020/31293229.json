The Times of India gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Sribalaji makes a middling debut as director with this movie. Though it could have been made into a breezy entertainer, it ends up as an unsatisfactory watch\".http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie- reviews/Kullanari-Koottam/movie-review/7816244.cms Rediff gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Sri Balaji's script does lack logic in a few places and sags at times, but taken with its humour quotient, it's still a reasonably fresh attempt at a feel-good love story\".http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/south- review-kullanari-koottam/20110328.htm The Hindu wrote, \"It's heartening that writer and director Sri Balaji has consciously steered clear of clich\u00e9s in his maiden attempt. Without a hero who challenges the cantankerous, villains who are ruthless, a comedy track that's disjointed, stunts which are unbelievable and duets that come with unnatural jigs, Sri Balaji has made Kullanari Kootam fairly engaging\".http://www.hindu.com/cp/2011/03/27/stories/2011032750020200.htm Sify wrote, \"Like the proverbial curate\u2019s egg, KK is good in parts, but could have been better\".http://www.sify.com/movies/kulanari-koottam-review- tamil-14966127.html The New Indian Express wrote, \"The film is mildly engaging, and a clean wholesome entertainer\".http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/article462121.ece Behindwoods gave 1 star out of 5 and wrote, \"The plot had the potential to be woven into an interesting tale, had only the director made an attempt to impart some airtight packaging in the content. KNK very slowly unravels, takes various detours in its path, the scenes and dialogues get boring and the concept flounders. The connection of the audience with the characters does not happen and the amateurish performance of most of the artists further adds up to this factor\".http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movie- reviews/reviews-2/mar-11-04/kullanari-kootam-review.html Indiaglitz wrote, \"Kudos to Sri Balaji and Vishnu for rendering a movie that is entertaining and light without any overdose of emotions. If you are not looking for a serious stuff, 'Kullanari Koottam' may be the right choice to spend few hours of your weekend\".http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/review/12534.html Deccan Herald wrote, \"Rendered in a lackadiscal fashion, Sribalaji\u2019s Kullanari Koottam is not the proverbial entertainer and falls flat in its intentions with nothing to write home about\".http://www.deccanherald.com/content/148906/F ==References== ==External links== * *Kullanari Koottam Movie Review Category:2011 films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films shot in Madurai Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Films scored by V.
