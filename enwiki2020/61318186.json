    "text": "Portrait of Clemenceau (1879-1880) by \u00c9douard Manet :For Manet's larger 1872 work of the same title, see Portrait of Clemenceau (Manet, Fort Worth) Portrait of Clemenceau is an oil painting on canvas of 1879\u201380 by \u00c9douard Manet, now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. The work can be dated via two letters of 9 December 1879 and 8 January 1880 from their subject fixing sitting dates.Cited in Cachin, Moffett, Wilson-Bareau, p. 443 Clemenceau was not happy with the work, stating \"My portrait by Manet? Very bad, I don't have it and I don't mind that. It is at the Louvre, I ask myself why we put it there\". But he enjoyed the sittings at Manet's home, enjoying the conversation and finding the painter very spiritual. Manet's youngest brother Gustave was a municipal councillor in Paris and it may have been through his mediation that Manet met Clemenceau. Alternatively, the pair may have met at the home of Paul Meurice or \u00c9mile Zola. On Manet's death his daughter Suzanne gave the work to its subject. When Mary Cassatt brought her American friend Louisine Havemeyer to Clemenceau's home, Louisine sold her the work for 10000 francs in 1905. Madame Havemeyer then donated it to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in 1927, from which it was later assigned to its present home. == References== ==Bibliography== * * * Adolphe Tabarant, Les Manet de la collection Havemeyer: La Renaissance de l'art fran\u00e7ais, Paris, 1930, XIII \u00e9d. * \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, Manet racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame, vol. 2, t.
