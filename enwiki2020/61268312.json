Hussman Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami. She is known for her research on the genetics of common human diseases. This research has led to a number of findings of genes that increase the risk of certain diseases, such as apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer's disease, IL7R and multiple sclerosis, and complement factor H and macular degeneration. ==Education and career== A native of Buffalo, NY, Pericak-Vance attended Wells College, graduating in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in biology.

She subsequently served on the faculty of Duke University, where she eventually became director of the Center for Human Genetics, James B. Duke Professor of Medicine, and Chief of the Section of Medical Genetics at Duke University Medical Center. In January 2007, she left Duke to help launch the Miami Institute for Human Genomics now the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. ==Honors and awards== Pericak-Vance is a founding fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics. She was recognized in 1997 by Popular Science Magazine for The Best of What's New in Science and Technology for the Gene Identified for Alzheimer's Disease and by Newsweek Magazine as part of the \"The Century Club\". In 2001, she received the Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Louis D. from the Institut de France for her research on Alzheimer's disease. She was inducted into the Western New York Women's Hall of Fame (2002) and received Wells College Distinguished Alumnae Award (2003) She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2003. She received the Hauptman-Woodward pioneer of Science award in 2004. Dr. Pericak-Vance received the Alzheimer\u2019s Association's Bengt Winblad lifetime achievement award in 2011, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012. In 2014, she received the Ming Tsuang Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics. She was Awarded the Plaza Health Network Foundation's Women of Distinction & Caring Award in 2019. ==Personal life== Pericak-Vance is married to Jeffery M Vance, MD, PhD, a graduate of Duke University School of Medicine, whom she met when they were both graduate students at Indiana University School of Medicine Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics. Dr. Jeffery Vance was the founding chair of the Dr. John T Macdonald Foundation Department of Human Genetics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. They had a son, Jeffery Joseph Vance, who died in 1998 from a rare clotting disorder known as thrombotic storm; their daughter, Danica Davies Vance, MD, is an orthopedic surgeon, a graduate of University of Miami School of Medicine. She completed her residency at Columbia University Department of Orthopedic Surgery and her fellowship in sports medicine at Duke University. Danica is currently a faculty member at Columbia University Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Miami, Beach. Their son, Richard L Belton, graduated from Wake Forest University, where he played fullback for the football team culminating in an Atlantic Coast Conference Championship and Orange Bowl appearance. He is now a successful basketball coach and youth leader in South Florida. ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:American geneticists Category:Women geneticists Category:University of Miami faculty Category:Duke University faculty Category:Wells College alumni Category:Indiana University Bloomington alumni Category:Human geneticists Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Alzheimer's disease researchers Category:Fellows of the American College of Medical Genetics ",
