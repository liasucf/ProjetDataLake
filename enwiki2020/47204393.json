The tournament was played at Carolier Brunswick Zone in North Brunswick, New Jersey during April 2009. Fairleigh Dickinson defeated Nebraska in the championship match, 4 games to 3 (209\u2013167, 202\u2013222, 203\u2013213, 229\u2013192, 201\u2013222, 230\u2013190, 208\u2013174), to win their second national title. The Knights were coached by Mike LoPresti. FDU's Daniele McEwan was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. McEwan, along with four other bowlers, also comprised the All Tournament Team. ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 8 teams were invited to contest this championship, which consisted of a modified double-elimination style tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
