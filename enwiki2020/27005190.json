The dam was built for hydroelectric power production, flood control and to provide water for industrial and agricultural use. Construction on the dam began in 1987 and it was complete in 1997. In 2000 the power plant portion of the project was given to Iran Water & Power Resources Development Co. from the Mazandaran Regional Water Authority. An earthquake halted the project in 2002 but the power plant was completed in 2007. It is named after ex-prime minister and president of Iran, Mohammad-Ali Rajai who was killed in a terrorist attack. ==See also== *List of power stations in Iran *List of tallest dams in the world ==References== Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Iran Category:Arch dams Category:Dams completed in 1997 Category:Dams in Iran Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2007 Category:1997 establishments in Iran Category:Buildings and structures in Mazandaran Province Category:Tourist attractions in Mazandaran Province Category:Tourist attractions in Sari ",
