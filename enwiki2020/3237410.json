    "text": "Empress Wang, personal name unknown, was an empress of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. She was the third wife of Cao Fang, the third emperor of Cao Wei. Very little is known about her, other than that she was the daughter of Wang Kui (\u738b\u5914), the director of imperial transportation. She was created empress in 254, after Cao Fang's second wife Empress Zhang was deposed in light of false accusations of treason levied against her father Zhang Ji (\u5f35\u7ddd) by the regent Sima Shi. It is not known whether Empress Wang was previously an imperial consort. Later in 254, Cao Fang considered a coup against Sima Shi, and while he ultimately did not carry out the plan, the news leaked, and Sima Shi deposed him and demoted him to the title of the Prince of Qi (which he held during his father Cao Rui's reign). What happened to Empress Wang is not known, although presumably she was allowed to have the title of the Princess of Qi. Nothing further is said about her in the official histories. ==See also== * Cao Wei family trees#Cao Fang * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).
