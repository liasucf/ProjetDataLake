It began on February 25 and ended on February 27, 2018, with a total of six games and three games per team. The competition took place at Prienai Arena in Prienai, Lithuania, with the games featuring Vytautas being streamed through Facebook. Wilki Morskie Szczecin, who play in the Polish Basketball League (PLK), claimed the tournament title after winning all three games and defeating runners-up, the Latvian second-tier VEF R\u012bga Skola, 94\u201374 in the deciding game. Slovenian team Helios Suns Dom\u017eale and hosts Vytautas Prienai\u2013Bir\u0161tonas finished in third and fourth place respectively. ==History== Following the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games, a series of exhibition games hosted by Vytautas Prienai\u2013Bir\u0161tonas in January 2018 to feature new American signees LaMelo and LiAngeo Ball, it was announced that the team was planning to hold a similar competition at the end of February. At the time, Vytautas offered several top European youth clubs to participate, and in the following weeks, it was revealed that they had also invited Italian teams. In addition, Vytautas attempted to bring Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) teams to the competition, but according to team general manager Adomas Kubilius, they turned down the invitations for financial reasons and due to the lack of defense in the exhibition games. On February 19, 2018, Vytautas officially announced the Big Baller Brand International Tournament. The tournament was played in a single round-robin format, with each team meeting all the other teams one time and final standings being determined by record. The Big Baller Brand International Tournament was sponsored by Big Baller Brand, a sports apparel company owned by LaVar Ball, the father of Vytautas players LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball. LaVar Ball also assumed the head coaching position for Vytautas during the tournament. The games that featured Vytautas were streamed live on Facebook through the Ballislife.com page. ==Venue== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
