    "text": "Buses under the Bus Contracting Model now bear the unified lush green livery for all new buses, and is now being progressively applied to older buses. The Bus Contracting Model (BCM), formerly known as the Government Contracting Model, is a contracting model introduced by the Land Transport Authority in 2014 for public buses in Singapore, implemented in 2016. The BCM is based on the Transperth model in Perth, Western Australia with quality incentive elements from London Buses. Under the BCM, local and overseas bus operators bid for contracts to operate public bus services on behalf of LTA. The LTA has also adopted a new unified lush green livery and logo for all buses, and now procures and owns the bus fleet for all public bus services in Singapore. ==History== First introduced in 2014, the Government of Singapore claimed that the new contracting model allows public bus services to be more responsive to changes in ridership and commuter needs and to encourage competition between bus operators, improving bus services for commuters. With the Bus Service Operating Licenses (BSOL) of SBS Transit and SMRT Buses expiring on 31 August 2016, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) decided to revamp the country's bus operations into a competitive tendering process. Under the contracting model, bus operators bid for the right to operate services while with the LTA as central planner, setting service levels and service standards. The LTA retains ownership of bus, depot and fleet management system assets. Operators that win a tender for a bus package are paid a fixed fee to operate the services. Under the bus industry model, the LTA claims that the commuters will benefit with lesser waiting time for buses. All bus services will run at intervals of not more than 15 minutes, and feeders will run at even shorter intervals at 6 to 8 minutes. The LTA initially tendered out three packages. These contracts are for five years, with two years extension if performance criteria is met. The remaining nine packages were reorganised into 11 packages, and are being run by the existing operators for periods of two to 10 years, after which the bus industry completed transitioning to the bus industry model. LTA will tender out these packages after these negotiated contracts expire. ==Package 1: Bulim Bus Package== In October 2014, the LTA called for tenders to operate the Bulim Bus Package comprising 26 existing bus services (41, 49, 66, 77, 78, 79, 96, 97, 97e, 98/98M, 106, 143/143M, 173, 177, 183, 189, 282, 284, 285, 333, 334, 335, 941, 945, 947, 990) originating from Bukit Batok, Jurong East and Clementi bus interchanges. Since then, services 653, 657 and 944 were added into this package under SMRT Buses on 13 April 2017, 24 April 2017 and 27 August 2017 respectively.

In September 2020, the LTA awarded the contract for the second term of this package to Tower Transit Singapore.
