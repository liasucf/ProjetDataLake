In January 2016, Christy Reeves succeeded Elisabeth Mason as CEO of Single Stop. ==Approach== Single Stop locates its services within organizations already serving low-income Americans, such as food pantries, schools, and health centers. Staff is trained to screen individuals for the benefits and services for which they may be eligible as well as provide assistance in accessing those resources. Single Stop's initiatives focus on creating financial stability for such specific low-income populations as community college students and veterans. On campus, Single Stop assists community colleges in retaining students through completion, thus reducing dropout rates and increasing students\u2019 future income. Single Stop also helps the Office of Veterans Affairs transition veterans back to civilian life and reduce the number of veterans living in poverty. According to the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Single Stop \u201chas grown fast, and it\u2019s poised to grow still more. Its goal, according to [CEO] Mason, is to serve more than 1 million households annually by 2018. By expanding its reach into community colleges, veterans\u2019 facilities, and other venues, Single Stop aims to equip more and more clients with the skills, services, and benefits that they need to gain a shot at sustainable economic security.\u201d Single Stop was cited by Fast Company as one of \u201cthe world\u2019s top ten most innovative companies of 2015 in social good\u201d for its work in developing software that will enable individuals to self-screen for benefits via a mobile phone or web browser without having to visit a Single Stop office. The software was scheduled to launch in 2016, but is still not available today. ==Citations== * * * * ==References== Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States ",
