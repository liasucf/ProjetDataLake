    "text": "Mariscal Sucre International Airport () was the main international airport serving Quito, Pichincha Province, Ecuador. It was the busiest airport in Ecuador by passenger traffic, by aircraft movement and by cargo movement, and one of the busiest airports in South America. It was named after Venezuelan- born Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, a hero of Ecuadorian and Latin American independence. It began operations in 1960, and during its last years of operation, handled about 6.2 million passengers and 164,000 metric tons of freight per year. The airport, one of the highest in the world (at AMSL) was located in the northern part of the city, in the Chaupicruz parish, within five minutes of Quito's financial center; the terminals were located at the intersection of Amazonas and La Prensa avenues. Mariscal Sucre International was the largest hub for TAME with an average of 50 daily departures. The old Mariscal Sucre International Airport ceased all operations at 19:00 on February 19, 2013, following the departure of TAME flight 321 to Guayaquil (scheduled for 18:55). Iberia operated the final international departure from the airport. On the morning of February 20, 2013, all operations moved to the new Mariscal Sucre International Airport. The first domestic flights scheduled to arrive at the new airport were TAME Flight 302 originating in Guayaquil, and LAN Flight 2590 originating in Lima, Peru. The new airport is located in the Tababela parish, about to the east of the city. It was constructed by a private consortium. The former airport is now the site of Parque Bicentenario, the biggest urban park in Quito. Due to its location in the middle of a city surrounded by mountains, the old airport could no longer be expanded to accommodate any larger aircraft or an increase in air traffic. Its operation posed risks; several serious accidents and incidents had occurred in years prior to its closure.Report on the conditions of the current airport and the benefits of a new airport (Inter-American Development Bank) ==History== Mariscal Sucre International Airport was inaugurated in 1960, the main terminal was designed during the government of President Velasco Ibarra. The present terminal and concourses (A, B and C) were refurbished in 2003, consisting of several taxiways, maintenance platforms, parking areas, a cellar, passenger halls, mezzanine areas and other amenities. Terminal B consisted of two floors; the lower level held the departures area with executive waiting rooms and restaurants, and the upper level consisted of airline and airport offices. The airport had ten gates, five with Jet bridges and five with stairs. ===TAME's main hub=== On 10 December 2000, TAME officially opened its hub in Quito, offering an estimated 2,000 possible connections per week, including greater numbers of frequencies, schedules and destinations served. Connections between domestic and international destinations were operated directly and through code sharing agreements with airlines such as TACA Airlines and Copa Airlines. Operations out of Quito allowed travelers to connect between domestic destinations (such as Guayaquil to Gal\u00e1pagos), from a domestic destination to an international destination (Such as Tena to Cali), from an international destination to a domestic city (Such as Cali to Tulc\u00e1n), between two international destinations (Such as Bogota to Panama City) and allows for simpler codeshare connections (such as Lima to Santa Rosa with TACA Airlines and TAME). The hub also featured facilities for easier transits, such as exclusive check-in counters for travelers in transit, buses for internal transportation between Terminals A & B, and two special lounges for national and international transit passengers to avoid having to go through Ecuadorian customs and immigration between transits. TAME's hub transferred to Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Tababela on February 19, 2013. ==Facilities== The airport consisted of one terminal split into a national and international areas. It was equipped with five swing gates capable of directing arriving passengers to either Immigration or to baggage claim. In addition, there were numerous ground slots where passengers walked to the aircraft from the terminal. ==Passenger services== ===VIP lounges=== Mariscal Sucre Airport had 4 VIP Salons in the terminals A and B. For passengers of AeroGal, there was an exclusive salon near gate 2,\"AeroGal VIP Club\". Passengers of TAME had access to the \"TAME\" VIP Lounge in terminal B, a lounge that was exclusively for first and business class passengers. This area was nominated as the best VIP lounge of the year in Ecuador, the \"QUIPORT VIP Club\", and a lesser VIP Lounge, the \"American Airlines Admirals Club\" in the gate 10. ===Transportation=== Transportation between the airport and city was provided by taxis, tour buses and vans. For security reasons, visitors were recommended to take only those taxis offered by registered companies at the airport Terminal A arrivals area. ==Terminals, airlines and destinations== The airlines in bold are operative, the airlines with cursive are operative, but no longer serves Quito. ===Domestic Terminal=== This terminal served national arrivals and departures, the airlines that served here were: (Incomplete list) *AeroGal (Cuenca, Guayaquil, El Coca, Manta, Lago Agrio) *Austro A\u00e9reo (Cuenca) *Ecuatoriana de Aviaci\u00f3n (Guayaquil) *Icaro Air (Guayaquil, Coca, Manta) *LAN Ecuador (Cuenca, Guayaquil) *Panagra (Guayaquil) *SAEREO (Macas) *Saeta (Guayaquil, Cuenca, Baltra, San Crist\u00f3bal) *San (Guayaquil, Cuenca) *TAME (Baltra, Cuenca, Tulcan, Coca, Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Manta, Nueva Loja, Loja, Salinas, Santa Rosa, Macas, Tena) ===International Terminal=== This terminal served international arrivals and departures, the airlines, defunct or still operating, were: (Incomplete list) *Aces (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn-C\u00f3rdova) *Aero Continente (Lima) *Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas (Buenos Aires-Ezeiza) *AeroGal (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn- C\u00f3rdova, Lima, Miami, New York-JFK) *Aeroper\u00fa (Lima) *Air Comet (Madrid) *Air Europa (Madrid) *Air Madrid (Madrid, Barcelona) *Air France (Paris-Charles de Gaulle) *American Airlines (Miami) *AOM French Airlines (Paris-Orly) *Avensa (Caracas) *Avianca (Bogot\u00e1) *Braniff International (Miami, Newark, Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco) *British Caledonian (Caracas, London- Gatwick) *Continental Airlines (Houston-Intercontinental, Newark) *Copa Airlines (Panama City) *Copa Airlines Colombia' (Bogot\u00e1) *Cruzeiro (S\u00e3o Paulo, R\u00edo de Janeiro) *Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n (La Habana) *Delta Air Lines (Atlanta) *Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n (Santo Domingo) *Eastern Air Lines (Miami, New York- JFK) *Ecuatoriana de Aviaci\u00f3n (Buenos Aires-Ezeiza, Asunci\u00f3n, Antofagasta, Chicago, Mexico City, Canc\u00fan, Montevideo, Panama City, Cali, Caracas, Bogot\u00e1, La Paz, Lima, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Madrid, Manaus, Miami, Montreal, Toronto, Tel Aviv, Nassau, New York-JFK, Washington, R\u00edo de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Santiago de Chile) *Icaro Air (Bogot\u00e1, Cali) *Iberia (Madrid) *KLM (Amsterdam) *LACSA (San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica) *Lufthansa (Frankfurt, Lima, San Juan de Puerto Rico) *LAN Airlines (Santigo de Chile, Miami) *LAN Ecuador (Madrid, Miami, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza, Santigo de Chile) *LAN Per\u00fa (Lima, Cali, Medell\u00edn-C\u00f3rdova) *Lapsa (Asunci\u00f3n) *Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano (Santa Cruz de la Sierra, La Paz) *Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n (Mexico City) *Pan Am (Miami, New York-JFK) *Panagra (Miami, Lima, Bogot\u00e1, New York- JFK) *Saeta (Bogot\u00e1, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza, Caracas, Mexico City, Panama City, Lima, Cusco, La Paz, Los Angeles, Medell\u00edn, Miami, New York, Santiago de Chile) *Servivensa (Caracas) *TACA Airlines (San Salvador) *TACA Peru (Lima) *TAME (Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Caracas, Lima, Panama City, S\u00e3o Paulo) *United Airlines (Houston-Intercontinental) *Varig (S\u00e3o Paulo, R\u00edo de Janeiro, San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica) *VASP (S\u00e3o Paulo) *Viasa (Bogot\u00e1, Caracas) ===Cargo airlines and destinations=== These destinations were operated from the Cargo Terminal. *ABSA Cargo Airline (Fortaleza, Guayaquil, Manaus, S\u00e3o Paulo-Viracopos, Miami, Panama City) *AeroSucre (Bogot\u00e1) *Air Cargo Germany (Bogota, Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Hahn, Mexico City, Toronto-Pearson) *Atlas Air (New York-JFK) *Cargolux (Bogot\u00e1, Luxembourg City, Maastricht, S\u00e3o Paulo-Viracopos) *Centurion Air Cargo (Miami) *Cielos Airlines (Lima, Miami) *DHL Aero Expreso (Miami) *FedEx Express (Memphis, Miami) *Florida West International Airways (Miami) *LAN Cargo (Amsterdam, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza, Miami, Santiago de Chile) *LANCO (Amsterdam, Bogot\u00e1, Miami, Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o) *Lufthansa Cargo (Frankfurt) *L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Suramericanas (Bogot\u00e1) *Martinair (Aguadilla, Amsterdam, Miami, San Jose de Costa Rica) *MasAir (Los Angeles, Mexico City) *Singapore Airlines Cargo (Bogot\u00e1, Brussels, S\u00e3o Paulo-Viracopos) *Southern Air (Miami) *TAMPA Cargo (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Miami) *UPS (Miami) *World Airways Cargo (Miami) Old Airport (near the top of the image) spotted from a KLM MD-11 on approach to it in 2010. ==Accidents and incidents== *29 November 2012: A Boeing 737-800 of Copa Airlines went off the runway during landing, leaving the main landing gear about 3 feet from the concrete.
