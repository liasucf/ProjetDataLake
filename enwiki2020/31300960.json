It has an area of and covers eastern Sarpang District, the western half of Zhemgang District, and western Pemagatshel District. It is connected via \"biological corridors\" to Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Thrumshingla National Park, and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary. Royal Manas also directly abuts the World Heritage Site Manas National Park in Assam, India, to the south. It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion. Entry is prohibited to the public. ==History== Royal Manas was one of the earliest focuses of the Bhutan Trust Fund in the early 1990s, receiving infrastructure development and baseline biological and socio-economic assessments. Bhutan's first park management plan was prepared for Royal Manas, and guided management of other parks. ==Natural history== ===Flora=== Habitats in Royal Manas National Park range from lowland tropical forests to permanent ice fields. Ecoregions in the park include Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests and Himalayan subtropical pine forests. Royal Manas also produces several plant species used in food, commerce, medicine, and religious rituals. About 5,000 people live in remote, isolated villages within the park. ===Fauna=== Royal Manas National Park is home to Bengal tigers, elephants, gaur (Bos gaurus), as well as rarer golden langur (Presbytis geei), pygmy hog (Sus salvanius), hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), and Ganges river dolphin (Platanista). It is also the only Bhutanese park inhabited by the one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). Hundreds of species of birds \u2014 including four species of hornbills \u2013 rufous- necked, wreathed, pied and great Indian \u2014 also live in the vast park. The Manas River and its tributaries are home to three species of rare migratory game fish called mahseer: the deep-bodied mahseer (Tor tor), golden mahseer (Tor putitora), and chocolate mahseer or Katle (Acrossocheilus hexangonolepis). ==See also== * List of the national parks of Bhutan * List of protected areas of Bhutan * Manas National Park \u2014 adjacent in Assam, India. ==References== Category:National parks of Bhutan Category:Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests Category:Himalayan subtropical pine forests Category:Pemagatshel District Category:Sarpang District Category:Zhemgang District Category:Protected areas established in 1966 ",
