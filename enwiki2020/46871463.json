It has been observed on June 1 each year since 2001. The day is intended to provide an opportunity to bring attention to activities that are connected with the dairy sector. == History == World Milk Day was first designated by the FAO in 2001. June 1 was chosen as the date because many countries were already celebrating a milk day during that time of year. The Day provides an opportunity to focus attention on milk and raise awareness of dairy\u2019s part in healthy diets, responsible food production, and supporting livelihoods and communities. This is supported by FAO data showing that more than one billion people's livelihoods are supported by the dairy sector and that dairy is consumed by more than six billion people globally. The fact that many countries choose to do this on the same day lends additional importance to individual national celebrations and shows that milk is a global food. World Milk Day Celebrations World Milk Day 2016 In 2016, World Milk Day was celebrated in over 40 countries. Activities included marathons and family runs, milking demonstrations and farm visits, school-based activities, concerts, conferences and seminars, competitions and a range of events focusing on promoting the value of milk and illustrating the important role played by the dairy industry in the national economy. World Milk Day 2017 In 2017, 588 events took place in 80 countries reaching 402 million impressions on social media for #WorldMilkDay.

Their objections to World Milk Day center around the environmental impact, health effects, and animal abuse of the dairy industry. The movement is promoted by the use of the #WorldPlantMilkDay hashtag. == References == == External links == * Official FAO site * World Milk Day website * World Milk Day \u2013 Info, Date, History, Activities, Theme Category:United Nations days Category:June observances Category:Observances about food and drink Category:Milk ",
