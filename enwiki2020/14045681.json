    "text": "In enzymology, a lathosterol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction center 5\u03b1-cholest-7-en-3\u03b2-ol + NAD(P)H + H+ \\+ O2 \\rightleftharpoons cholesta-5,7-dien-3\u03b2-ol + NAD(P)+ + 2 H2O The 5 substrates of this enzyme are 5\u03b1-cholest-7-en-3\u03b2-ol, NADH, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 4 products are cholesta-5,7-dien-3\u03b2-ol (provitamin D3), NAD+, NADP+, and H2O. == Classification == This enzyme is one of C-5 sterol desaturases, belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated. == Nomenclature == The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5\u03b1-cholest-7-en-3\u03b2-ol,NAD(P)H:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include \u03947-sterol \u03945-dehydrogenase, \u03947-sterol 5-desaturase, \u03947-sterol-C5(6)-desaturase, and 5-DES. == Biological role == This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids. It has 2 cofactors: FAD, and FMN. ==See also== *Fatty acid desaturase *C-5 sterol desaturase ==References== * * * * Category:EC 1.14.21 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:NADH-dependent enzymes Category:Flavin enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
