(advertisement), Seattle Post- Intelligencer, October 29, 1924, page 7.

Limited Commercial license, serial #307, issued for operation on 360 meters for a period of three months to Louis Wasmer in Seattle, Washington. for operation on the 360 meter (833 kHz) \"entertainment\" wavelength. Wasmer was a former United Wireless Telegraph Company radiotelegraph operator, who had opened the Excelsior Motorcycle and Bicycle Co. in 1911, and also sold radio equipment.\"Who's Who in Seattle\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 3, 1922, page 17. Following two weeks of transmitter adjustment, the station made its debut broadcast on February 27, 1922. Its initial schedule was phonograph music presented every evening between 7 and 8:30. KHQ was the second Seattle station licensed following the formal establishment of a broadcasting service category on December 1, 1921 by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the regulators of radio at this time.\"Amendments to Regulations\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. The first Seattle station licensed under these new regulations was KFC on December 8, 1921, which was operated jointly by the Northern Radio and Electric Company and the Post-Intelligencer newspaper. A third Seattle station, Vincent I. Kraft's KJR didn't receive a broadcasting station license until March 9, 1922. However Kraft had begun broadcasting over an experimental station beginning in 1920, thus, when KHQ debuted it was described by a local newspaper as \"the third broadcaster\".\"Three Broadcasters Busy\", Seattle Daily Times, February 28, 1922, page 5. In March KHQ suspended operations for nearly two weeks, returning with a 50-watt transmitter that replaced the original 10-watt set,\"Stronger Set Is Ready\", Seattle Daily Times, March 29, 1922, page 7. which had been sold to the Economy Market so it could establish station KZC.\"Radio News\", Seattle Daily Times, April 25, 1922, page 25. KZC was short- lived and was deleted on April 11, 1923. Because initially there was only the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters available for use by multiple stations, regions had to set up a timesharing agreement to allocate individual station timeslots. On November 28, 1922 KHQ had the fewest programs of four listed stations, with a schedule of 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.\"What's In The Air\", Seattle Star, November 28, 1922, page 5. In January 1925, KHQ began broadcasting from a studio located at the Bush & Lane Piano Company store on Third Avenue,\"Bush & Lane Station To Broadcast Wednesday\", Seattle Times, January 18, 1925, page 5. and the station also moved to 1100 kHz.\"Additions and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 2, 1925, page 8. ====Spokane==== In May 1925 it was announced that KHQ was temporarily going off the air in order to give Bush & Lane time to \"make extensive alterations in the studio\", in addition to a major facility upgrade.\"KHQ To Be Improved\", Seattle Daily Times, May 17, 1925, page 18. Instead, after broadcasting for three years in Seattle, Wasmer relocated the station to Spokane,\"KHQ - 1922 to Present\" by Bill Harms (philcobill.com) reportedly transporting the radio equipment in a motorcycle sidecar.\"Louis Wasmer, Pioneer of Radio, Dies\", Seattle Daily Times, August 25, 1967, page 49.

KOE,Licensed to the Spokane Chronicle, April 12, 1922\u2212October 7, 1922. KFIO (now KSBN) and KFPY (now KXLY), although only KFIO and KFPY were still licensed at the time of KHQ's arrival. Part of the move included an upgrade from 100 to 1,000 watts, although the station remained on 1100 kHz. KHQ's Spokane debut on October 30, 1925, from the Davenport Hotel, was made with great fanfare.\"New Radio Will Make Bow Tonight\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, 30 October 1925, page 3.\"Ceremonies Will Mark Opening of New Radio Plant\", Spokane Chronicle, 29 October 1925, page 1. Announcer Frank \"Spark Plug\" Buhlert told listeners that \"The first 500 persons who send telegrams or phone in that they have heard the program will receive a souvenir bag of ore from the world's largest lead mine, the Bunker Hill & Sullivan, at Kellogg, Idaho.\"\"KHQ Goes On Air Here\", Spokane Spokesman-Review, 30 October 1925, page 11. The debut broadcast ran from 8 p.m. to midnight,\"KHQ's Debut is Big Success\", Spokane Spokesman-Review, 31 October 1925, page 1. and included assorted speeches and music.\"Chronicle to Broadcast Halloween Parade Report\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, 31 October 1925, page 2. Wasmer moved the station's studios and office across Post Street from the Davenport Hotel to the seventh floor of Spokane Stock Exchange Building (also called the Eilers Building) in 1928 because the fledgling station had outgrown its quarters in the hotel.\"KHQ Will Move Radio Studios\", Spokane Spokesman-Review, 2 May 1928. KGA later joined KHQ in the building, which was subsequently renamed the Radio Central Building.\"KHQ - Radio Central Building\" by Bill Harms, Spokane Radio History (philcobill.com) KHQ changed its transmitting frequency a number of times in the mid-twenties, until November 11, 1928, when, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, it was reassigned to 590 kHz\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, 30 November 1928, page 8. which it and its successors have used ever since. The August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission's \"duopoly\" rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market.\"Ban On Multiple Ownership in Same Area\", Broadcasting, August 11, 1941, pages 6-7. At this time Louis Wasmer, Inc. owned two Spokane stations: KHQ and KGA. To conform with the FCC order, in 1946 Wasmer sold KHQ to the Cowles Publishing Company, publisher of The Spokesman-Review newspaper,\"FCC Approves KHQ Sale to Newspaper\", Broadcasting, February 11, 1946, page 42. which used it to launch an FM station (now KISC) and a television station (which still bears the KHQ-TV calls). KHQ stayed in the Radio Central Building until 1960, when it moved to a modern facility next to its transmitter site on South Regal on the Moran Prairie.KHQ Radio Broadcasting Station Licenses from 1934 to 1937.

From the National Archives, College Park, Maryland. ===KLSN=== Cowles sold off its radio interests in 1984; on New Year's Day 1985, and kept the historic KHQ call letters for its TV station. Because of a FCC rule in place at the time that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market but with different ownership from sharing the same call letters, AM 590 changed its call to KLSN, with the slogan \"Listen 5-90\". ===KAQQ=== On December 1, 1986 the station changed its call sign to KAQQ, which was phonetically similar to the original KHQ call letters. ===KQNT=== On New Year's Day 2002 the call letters became KQNT. ==References== ==External links== *News/Talk 590's website (590kqnt.iheart.com) *FCC History Cards for KQNT (covering KHQ 1927-1981) * Philco Bill's History of KHQ Radio (spokaneradio.philcobill.com) *Philco Bill's Spokane Radio Tower Page (spokane.radiotowers.info) QNT Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Washington (state) Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ",
