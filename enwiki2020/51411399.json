    "text": "The Jaffa riots of April 1936, known to Jews as The Bloody Day in Jaffa (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5), refers to a spate of violent attacks on Jews that began on 19 April 1936 in Jaffa. A total of 14 Jews and 2 Arabs were killed during the riots. The event is often described as marking the start of the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine. ==15 April== British Mandatory authorities and other contemporary sources dated the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine to 15 April,Bauer, Yehuda. \"The Arab Revolt of 1936,\" New Outlook, Vol.9 No. 6 (81), 1966, p. 49.Hillel Cohen, Army of Shadows: Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917\u20131948, University of California Press, 2008, p. 95. the date of the Anabta shooting in which Arab followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam set up a roadblock on the Nablus to Tulkarm road, stopping about 20 vehicles to demand cash and weapons; separating out 3 Jews from other occupants of the vehicles. The Arabs then shot the 3 Jewish men; only 1 survived.'Nablus Bandits Seen as Izz ed Din's followers', Palestine Post, Friday, 17 April 1936. The two killed Jewish drivers were Israel (or Yisrael) Khazan, who was killed instantly, and Zvi Dannenberg, who died five days later.\"Highwaymen's Second Victim Dead\", Palestine Post, 21 April 1936.'Turk Killed by Hold-up Men', Palestine Post, 16 April 1936. The following day members of Irgun shot and killed two Arab workers sleeping in a hut near Petah Tikva.Gilbert, Martin (1998), Israel: A History Black Swan, p. 80. On 17 April, the funeral for Khazan was held in Tel Aviv, attracting a crowd of thousands, some of whom beat Arab passersby and vandalized property.Bar-On, Mordechai (2004). A Never- ending Conflict: A Guide to Israeli Military History, Greenwood, p. 23. == 19 April == On 19 April, rumors spread in the Arab community that \"many Arabs had been killed by Jews\", and Arabs began to attack Jews in the streets of Jaffa. An Arab mob marched on the Jewish-owned Anglo-Palestine Bank. The British Mandatory police guarding the bank defended themselves by firing into the mob, killing two of the rioters. This incited the mob to \"fury\" and Jews began to be killed in the streets. Manuela Williams describes this as the \"peak\" event in a series of violent attacks leading up to the declaration of a general strike by the Arab Higher Committee. According to Aryeh Avneri, citing the History of the Haganah, the rioting broke out first among the Haurani dockworkers in Jaffa Port. A mob of Arab men rampaged through the mixed Muslim, Christian and Jewish streets of Jaffa, killing and beating Jews and wrecking Jewish homes and businesses.Rose, Norman. \"The Debate on Partition, 1937-38: The Anglo-Zionist Aspect: I. The Proposal\", Middle Eastern Studies 6, no. 3 (1970): 297-318. . 11 people were reported dead in the first day's rioting. These included 2 Arabs \"shot by British police in self-defense,\" and 9 Jews, with dozens of others wounded, \"most of the Jewish injured bore knife wounds.\"9 Jews, 2 Arabs Dead, 54 Hurt In Jaffa Riots: Moslems Slain by British Police, Foes Knifed in Batlle (sic) Following Killing of a Jew by Bandits,\" New York Herald Tribune, 20 April 1936, p. 1. The rioting went on for a total of 3 days, it was finally suppressed by the British military. ==Impact== ===Refugees=== The continuing threat of violence combined with the destruction of Jewish property and arson attacks that destroyed Jewish homes forced 12,000 Jews to flee Jaffa as refugees. 9,500 were housed by the Tel Aviv municipality, imposing a heavy financial burden on the city. Seventy-five temporary shelters were created in schools, synagogues, government and industrial buildings.Marginal Populations and Urban Identity in Time of Emergency: The Case of the 1936 Refugees in Tal Aviv,\" Arnon Golan, Journal of Modern Jewish Studies, Vol. 9 , Iss. 2, 2010. During May and June the Haganah was able to stabilize the security situation to the point where about 4,000 of the refugees were able to return to their homes. Others found housing privately, so that by July only 4,800 remained in public refugee camps; 3,200 of these were utterly destitute. By November, Jewish charities had placed even the destitute refugees in housing, and the refugee camps were closed. ===Annexation of Jaffa to Tel Aviv=== One impact of the riot was the start of a political demand that the Jewish neighborhoods of Jaffa be separated from Jaffa and incorporated into Tel Aviv.

In The Blood of His Servants, Malcolm MacPherson writes of 19 April as the day when the Arab revolt on Palestine began, and a \"campaign of armed attacks\" started. In his 1968 book, Days of Fire, Shmuel Katz, a senior member of the Irgun, wrote of arriving in Tel Aviv from Jerusalem on 19 April to find the town in turmoil with reports of stabbing in nearby Jaffa. ==See also== * 1938 Tiberias massacre * 1921 Jaffa riots ==References== Category:1936 riots Category:1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine Category:1936 in Mandatory Palestine Category:Anti-Jewish pogroms by Muslims Category:April 1936 events Category:Jaffa Category:Riots and civil disorder in Israel ",
