Headquartered in Tehran, it is the principal agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather forecasting and seismology, operating hundreds of observation stations across Iran. ==History== In 1298, the meteorological office was included in the Barzegaran school curriculum, taught by French teachers. The first platform for the measurement of meteorological data, air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall was built and completed in 1929 in the Barzegaran school. After World War II, the first meteorological observatories were established in Iran by the Allies in 1948. The study of the atmosphere has always been of interest to Iranian scientists. Therefore, many astronomers have devoted part of their work to atmospheric issues. Muhammad ibn Zakaria al-Razi, Ibn Sina, Hakim Omar Khayyam, Abu Rihan al-Biruni, and Anwari were among the Iranian personalities and scholars who wrote about atmospheric phenomena in their works. Regular meteorological activities began with the measurement of atmospheric elements, British and Russian embassies in Tehran and the oil-rich southern regions of the country, and this information was transferred only to the archives of the respective countries and probably used in their research programs. The meteorological course was included in the curriculum of the Barzegaran School in 1298, taught by French teachers, and the first meteorological platform was built on the same site to measure air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall. The meteorological station was completed in 1308 and housed most of the atmospheric elements, until gradually, due to the extreme need of agriculture and irrigation, a number of other stations were established in different parts of the country as needed, with the independent irrigation firm. , Affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture at the time. After World War II, Allied forces set up a small meteorological unit to meet the aviation needs of the aviation sector for the health of the flight of its own aircraft. At that time, the Independent Irrigation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture trained a group of meteorological observers, who graduated in 1327 and worked at meteorological stations. The national airline also set up meteorological stations due to the need for weather information at the country's airports. Due to the urgent need for climate change statistics and information from different parts of the country and the inconsistency in the establishment of meteorological stations - which were created in different sectors - the authorities of the time considered it necessary to establish an independent meteorological unit in the country; Therefore, in 1334, the General Meteorological Office of the country, affiliated to the Ministry of Roads, was established. The General Directorate later became an independent organization under the auspices of the Ministry of War, which, under the auspices of the Islamic Revolution, regained control of the Ministry of Roads and Transportation. At the time of the establishment of the General Meteorological Office in 1334, all meteorological stations - which had been established in various departments - were handed over to this General Directorate. The assigned stations were of synoptic, climatological and rainfall type, each carrying out its own observations. At that time, there were thirty-four synoptic stations, one hundred and seven climatological stations, and one hundred and sixty meteorological stations. The expansion of meteorological stations and the development of its network accelerated after the victory of the Islamic Revolution. In 1338, Iran's meteorology became a member of the World Meteorological Organization as one hundred and third members of the World Meteorological Organization. Prior to the Islamic Revolution of Iran, the country's Meteorological Organization was more in the service of air transport and the aviation industry, and less attention was paid to practical meteorological issues; However, after the Islamic Revolution and by determining agriculture as the main axis of the country's economic activities, this organization also shifted its services to agriculture and today, the development of stations and the approach of the country's meteorological statistics system to provide services to agricultural research and animal husbandry. , Irrigation, etc., tends to. ==Heads of Meteorological Organization== *Before the revolution: -Professor Mohammad Hassan Ganji from 1335 to 1347 \\- Abdolhossein Parviz Navai from 1347 to 1357 \\- Ginos Nemat (Supervisor of 1978) \\- General Asghar Behsarsht (1978) *After the revolution : \\- Cyrus Ahadpour from 57 to 58 \\- Hassan Hajilari from 1958 to 1959 \\- Kazem Samadian from 1359 to 60 \\- Ali Mohammad Nourian from 60 to 72 \\- Hossein Ali Taravat from 1372 to 1373 \\- Ali Mohammad Nourian from 1973 to 1988 (second time) -Bahram Sanaei from 1988 to 1992 \\- Davood Parhizgar from 1992 to 1997 \\- Sahar Tajbakhsh since March 1997 ==Types of meteorological stations== The meteorological station is a facility on land or sea that has the tools and facilities to observe the state of the Earth's atmosphere and provides information for forecasting and studying water and climate. This information includes temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and wind direction. The measurement of wind speed and direction is done in such a way that there is no obstacle to the wind as much as possible, and the measurement of temperature and humidity is done away from direct sunlight. Manual measurements are performed at least once a day and automatic observations are performed at least once an hour. The climate of the sea is measured by ships and oceans, which measure relatively different aeronautical quantities, including sea surface temperature, wavelength, and wavelength. ==Meteorological services== Havanama system. SMS system; Havagu 134 Phone Touch screens Meteorological e-service desk ==weather forecast== Air forecasting is the use of scientific methods to estimate the weather in one to several days after the forecast time. Humans have been predicting the weather for thousands of years, but it was not until the nineteenth century that predictions began to be based on scientific methods. The parameters commonly used to predict weather conditions include: *Temperature determination *Measure the amount of atmospheric moisture *Atmospheric pressure measurement *Observe the appearance of the sky (in terms of the amount of clouds) *Determine the direction of the wind At present, the weather forecast of the country and cities is being done as a country in the meteorological forecasting and rapid warning center and locally in the provincial general administration. At a cabinet meeting on April 27, after the Nowruz floods in Shiraz, Hassan Rouhani stressed the need for accurate and timely information on incidents, saying: \"Meteorology, in addition to the valuable measures it is taking, should make more efforts and, more precisely, carefully.\" Inform about the time and place of the accident, and this can be very helpful. It is also possible to provide the necessary warnings to the people immediately through cyberspace ==References== Category:Governmental meteorological agencies in Asia Category:Government agencies of Iran ",
