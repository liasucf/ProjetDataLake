    "text": "Zygmunt J\u00f3zef Anczok (born 14 March 1946 in Lubliniec) is a former Polish footballer who played as a left-sided defender, who was an Olympic champion for Poland in the 1972 Summer Olympics. His biggest success came in 1972 when he won the Polish cup as well as appearing in several Polish international matches. His international career began in 1965 when he played against Scotland. At the time of his arrival in the national game, a player of such speed and agility was practically unheard of in Poland, and he frequently was substituted into games to bring to his teams extra power in not just defense, but attack. Anczok was given an opportunity in 1966 to go on a tour of South America, where he more than held his own against players such as Pel\u00e9. Numerous minor injuries gave him problems throughout the years to come, including in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He continued to play in Norway in the late seventies, before retiring as a player in 1979 and heading into management. He originally managed in Poland before health problems forced him into relinquishing his duties. ==References== Category:Footballers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of Poland Category:Olympic gold medalists for Poland Category:Poland international footballers Category:Polish footballers Category:Polonia Bytom players Category:G\u00f3rnik Zabrze players Category:Polish football managers Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lubliniec Category:Olympic medalists in football Category:Skeid Fotball players Category:Sportspeople from Silesian Voivodeship Category:Polish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Norway Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Association football defenders ",
