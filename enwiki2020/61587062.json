    "text": "\"Throw It Back\" is a song recorded by American rapper Missy Elliott for her first extended play Iconology (2019). The song was released as album's lead single on August 23, 2019. ==Composition== \"Throw It Back\" was written by Elliott, Quintin Ernest Talbet, Michael Aristotle, and William Jared Buggs, while production was handled by Willi Hendrix. Musically, \"Throw It Back\" has been described as a \"woozy, futuristic romp\" containing \"distorted bass lines\", frenetic production\", and trap snares. Lyrically, \"Throw It Back\" contains references to Elliott's history, as well as previous collaborators Tweet and Heavy D, and Elliott's 2002 single \"Work It\". ==Critical reception== Jordan Darville of The Fader, named \"Throw It Back\" \"the standout track\" from Iconology. ==Music video== A music video for \"Throw It Back\" was released alongside Iconology. It contains a guest appearance from Teyana Taylor. The video begins with a young girl waking up in an museum with paintings of the rapper. After entering a foggy room, Elliott appears with several dancers and cheerleaders in colorful outfits and afros. The video also contains references to Elliott's career, similar to the lyrical content. Anika Reed of USA Today described the video as \"[shwoing] Elliott's unwavering authenticity\" and \"celebrating blackness\". Katherine J. Igoe, writing for Marie Claire, called the video \"a complete return to form\" for Elliott. ==Personnel== Adapted from Iconology's liner notes. *Missy Elliott \u2013 lead artist, songwriter *Michael Aristotle \u2013 songwriter *Quintin Ernest Talbert \u2013 songwriter *Wili Hendrix \u2013 production *Chris Godbey \u2013 engineering *Glenn Schick \u2013 mastering *Finis \"KY\" White \u2013 mixing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2019) !Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canadian Hot Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 37 |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ List of release dates, showing region, formats, label, and reference ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | August 23, 2019 | Digital download | Atlantic | |- |} ==References== Category:2019 songs Category:Missy Elliott songs Category:Songs written by Missy Elliott ",
