They are best known for their 2007 single \"Same Jeans\" which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. The band is currently signed to Cooking Vinyl and have released five studio albums since their platinum selling debut Hats Off to the Buskers, which topped the UK Albums Chart in January 2007 and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Music Prize. Despite never matching this early success, they enjoy a large fanbase in their native Scotland with albums regularly topping the Scottish Albums Chart. The band also hold a reputation for their live performances with regularly sold out tours in Scotland. The View are also regular fixtures at music festivals throughout the UK; they have played at Scotland's largest festival\u2014T in the Park\u2014a record eight times, with organiser Geoff Ellis saying, \"The View can play every year under my watch, if they want to.\" ==History== ===Formation and early touring (2005-2006)=== The View initially formed around a cover band at school, playing their own versions of bands such as Squeeze and the Sex Pistols. Lead singer Kyle Falconer, guitarist Peter Reilly, bassist Kieren Webster and original drummer Michael Annable all attended St John's RC High School, They began by performing a number of their own songs and cover versions at school talent contests. The deputy head teacher of St John's stated that he knew the band would go far and he told them to push for a record deal. The View entered the school talent contest four times but were only successful twice. Following this, the band set up base to write their own material in a back room of The Bayview Pub, a bar owned by Falconer's cousin. They progressed to play more cover gigs and weddings around the Dundee area, including the Centenary Bar in Central Dundee and a caravan park in Arbroath. The band were later ejected from their base in The Bayview, following singer Kyle Falconer reportedly riding a scooter along the bar. The band continued to tour small venues around their hometown, and after their second billed gig at The Doghouse, they were signed to local independent Dundee record label Two Thumbs, and released the self-titled The View EP in early 2006. Alongside the EP, the band recorded a complete demo album at T-Pot studios in Perthshire and this was made available for download from the band's Two Thumbs management website. Videos were also made available to accompany some of the recordings. During this period the band came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 presenters Zane Lowe, Edith Bowman and Jo Whiley as well as BBC Radio 2 presenter Dermot O'Leary who gave them airplay nine months before the album hit number one. The band's live performance of \"Wasted Little DJs\" (later to be their first single) featured on Zane's show of 8 February 2006, alongside established acts The Kooks and Be Your Own Pet. Soon after, tracks from the debut EP began to be played on Radio 1 and other local and national stations. In particular, Jim Gellatly, at Xfm Scotland, featured the band heavily on X-Posure Scotland, his new music show. A live acoustic session was recorded for the show broadcast 3 May 2006. On 26 and 27 August 2006, the View were a last-minute addition to the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The NME reported the fans' chant of \"The View, the View are on fire\" could be heard ringing loudly around the packed tent. They also played both festivals in 2007. In mid-2006 the band began a UK wide headline tour. During this tour the band played their first headline show in Scotland at the Liquid Room on 1 September 2006, they then went on to play dates with other major acts and feature in the MTV2 Gonzo tour. Documenting this, a half-hour-long special On Tour With The View was broadcast on MTV2 on 18 November 2006. In December 2006, the band played gigs in Tokyo, Japan and made their first trip to the United States, in January 2007, playing dates in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. ===Hats Off to the Buskers (2006-2008)=== In mid-2006, they began to record their debut album, with Owen Morris, who had previously produced albums by Oasis and The Verve. During the production of the album, co-writer and bassist Kieren Webster was voted as number six on the NME Cool List 2006 Top 50. Titled Hats Off to the Buskers, the album was released on 22 January 2007 and entered the UK album chart at No. 1 on 28 January. Following the album's release, the band took part in the NME Awards Tour 2007, alongside acts such as The Automatic, The Horrors and Mumm-Ra and \"Wasted Little DJs\" was voted Best Track of the year at the annual NME Awards 2007. The View announced their \"Rocket to Russia\" tour which visited many countries around Europe such as Holland, Russia and Germany. During the tour, the View played with the Underground Heroes at the Tap'n'Tin in Chatham. At the end of the night, the View and Underground Heroes joined forces on a version of \"Same Jeans\". The union prompted the band to be called 'The Underground View'. In 2007, the band performed shows in Australia and performed \"Same Jeans\" on the talk show Rove Live. Instead of waiting on-stage to shake hands with the host, the band immediately left the stage, leaving Rove McManus with a simple pat on the back from Steven Morrison. Taken from the album, their first single, \"Wasted Little DJs\", was released 7 August 2006. The single is dedicated to a pair of blonde hairdressers from Dundee who go by the name \"wasted little DJs\". The girls set the trend for hairstyles in Dundee, and many of the band's female fans sport the same unique hairstyle. The first single entered the UK top 75 at No. 73 on the week before full release, due to download sales alone, and climbed to No. 15 the following week. Four weeks prior to release, on 9 July 2006, the single entered the UK MTV/NME video charts at Number 9, climbing to Number 1 on 13 August 2006. The single was the BBC Radio 1 Colin and Edith show's record of the week for week commencing Monday, 10 July 2006 and entered the BBC Radio 1 daytime playlist on 12 July 2006. The band followed up with their second single \"Superstar Tradesman\", released 23 October 2006, also reaching No. 15 in the UK. \"Same Jeans\", the third single from the album, was released 15 January 2007. It became their most successful single to date, reaching No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and becoming a major hit for the band. Subsequent singles however, a double a-side of \"The Don\"/\"Skag Trendy\" and \"Face for the Radio\", failed to receive such chart success, reaching only No. 33 and No. 69 respectively in the UK Singles Chart. \"The Don\"/\"Skag Trendy\" is to date the View's last single to chart in the UK top 40. In early 2006, the band signed to James Endeacott's new record label 1965 Records, part of the Sony BMG group and linked to Columbia Records. A rare live version of \"Screamin' n Shoutin'\", recorded at the University of Abertay Dundee, headlined the NME/1965 Records cover CD featured with the NME issue dated 25 November 2006. The band announced a national tour in April 2007 to mark the album release. Tickets for the entire UK tour sold out within 1 hour.

The EP also includes the Tim Hutton remix of \"Sunday\". ===Cheeky for a Reason (2012-2013)=== In an interview with NME after T in the Park 2011, frontman Kyle Falconer said that they had begun to write songs for the fourth album, and that it could be out by Christmas. However, he later admitted that these comments were rather over- enthusiastic, and the album would be ready around the summer of 2012. In autumn 2011, their website announced they were going to record demos in T Pot studios, the same studio they recorded the demos for Hats Off To The Buskers. Speaking about the album's sound, Kyle Falconer said it was \"Fleetwood Mac's Rumours done by The Clash.\" A free download of the album track, \"Hold On Now\" was available for a limited period in May 2012 to give fans a taster of the new album.
