The Royal Navy of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Real Marina del Regno delle Due Sicilie or Armata di Mare di S.M. il Re del Regno delle Due Sicilie) was the official term in documents of the era for the naval forces of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - it and the Royal Army together formed the Kingdom's armed forces. The modern use of the term Regio for royal was only introduced into the force's title after the annexation of the Kingdom of Sardinia. It was the most important of the pre- unification Italian navies and Cavour made it the model of the new Italian Regia Marina after the annexation of the Two Sicilies.Lamberto Radogna, Storia della Marina Militare delle Due Sicilie (1734-1860), Mursia 1978 ==References== ",
