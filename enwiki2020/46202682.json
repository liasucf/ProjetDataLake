An author of more than 140 publications in international journals and reviews, he has served as a researcher and professor at the University of Milan. Today, he is working at CERN where he is presently the project leader of the HL-LHC project. ==Biography== Lucio Rossi was born in Podenzano, Italy on 24 September 1955. In 1980 he obtained his PhD from University of Milan with a thesis on plasma physics. He was an academic researcher for many years after, interested in applied superconductivity for particle accelerators and in 1992 he became Professor of Experimental Physics in the University of Milan. During the 1990s, Rossi was involved in many experiments such as the Superconducting Cyclotron (SC) currently in Catania, HERA at DESY in Hamburg and Large Hadron Collider at Cern. His main activities were the design and construction of coils, solenoids, superconductors and prototypes for magnets. From 2001-2011 he led the Magnet Superconductor and Cryostat Group(MSC) for the LHC project. Since 2011 he has been leader of the High Luminosity for LHC. Since 1985 Rossi is one of the founders of \"Euresis\", a Milan-based association for the promotion of scientific culture established in Milan. ==Awards== * 2007: IEEE Council of Superconductivity Award * 2013: IEEE fellow award * 2020: Rolf Wider\u00f8e Prize ==See also== *CERN *Large Hadron Collider ==References== ==External links== * CERN official website *Scientific publications of Lucio Rossi on INSPIRE-HEP Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People associated with CERN Category:Italian physicists Category:University of Milan alumni ",
