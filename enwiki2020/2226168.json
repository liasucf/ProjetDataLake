The city was previously known by its Greek name of Ousakeion/\u039f\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. U\u015fak city is situated at a distance of from \u0130zmir, the region's principal metropolitan center and port city. Benefiting from its location at the crossroads of the Central Anatolian plateau and the coastal Aegean Region, and from a climate and agricultural production incorporating elements of both of these zones, U\u015fak has also traditionally had a strong industrial base. U\u015fak was the first city in Turkey to have an urban electricity network, and the first city where a collective labor relations agreement was signed, during the Ottoman era, between leather industry employees and workers. It was here that the first factory of Republican Turkey, a sugar refinery, was set up through a private sector initiative among local businessmen. The tradition of industriousness continues today around two industrial zones. ==History== Ancient church of Sebaste, at Selcikler (Usak) The first known organized states to have ruled over the region of present-day U\u015fak were the Phrygians in the eastern portion and the Lydians in the west during the seventh century BC. The Karun Treasure, discovered by clandestine treasure hunters in U\u015fak in 1965, and whose smuggling outside Turkey and subsequent retrieval decades later from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art made international headlines, gives an indication of the high degree of civilization attained by these Anatolian states. The region of Lydia was later taken over by the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC and by Alexander the Great and his successors as of the 4th century. Thereafter, U\u015fak was ruled successively by the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Germiyanids and finally the Ottoman Empire (as of 1429). Throughout classical times, until the Byzantine period, the city was called Ousakeion (\u039f\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) in Greek. Later, following Turkish conquest and domination over the area, the city became known by its Turkish name of U\u015f\u015fak; which could mean \"lovers\" and \"minstrels\" simultaneously. Tradition privileges the second derivation, which could be a reference to the region's rich folk literature. U\u015fak was occupied by the Greek army between 28 August 1920 and 1 September 1922. During the Greek retreat, Greek general Nikolaos Trikoupis was captured near U\u015fak at the village of G\u00f6\u011fem, today buried under a dam reservoir. U\u015fak was a district center within K\u00fctahya Province until 1953, when U\u015fak Province was constituted and U\u015fak became its provincial capital. ==Economic history== At least since the 17th century there was trade between U\u015fak and the Dutch republic as reflected in the rug shown thrown over the bannister in Vermeer's painting \"The Procuress.\" The rug was probably produced in U\u015fak, covers a third of the painting and shows medaillons and leaves.Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. The kelim rug shown in Vermeer's 1656 painting The Procuress was identified as probably originating in U\u015fak,Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. testifying to 17th Century trade linking the city with the Dutch Republic. In the early 20th century, mercury was discovered in U\u015fak. The town also manufactured carpet. Among other district centers in U\u015fak Province, Banaz is the largest and is notable for its varied agricultural production as well as for its forests, while Ulubey's canyon is a natural site attracting many visitors. ==Climate== U\u015fak has a hot summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Dsa) with continental influences, with cold, wet and regularly snowy winters and hot, long and dry summers. ==U\u015fak carpets== In pre-industrial times, U\u015fak was already a major center of production and export, particularly of Ushak carpets. Ushak carpets are also called Holbein carpets in reference to the 16th century painter Hans Holbein the Younger who depicted them in minute detail in his paintings, reflecting their popularity in European markets. The level of international popularity attained by U\u015fak's carpets became such that the word \"Ushak\" is considered an English word of Turkic origin.Merriam- Webster Unabridged - Ushak A heavy woolen oriental rug tied in Ghiordes knots and characterized by bright primary colors and an elaborate medallion pattern. Although U\u015fak's carpet patterns have evolved since then, large-scale weaving still continues and the name of the city still has an important presence in the market for carpets, both hand-woven and industrial. On the other hand, the district of E\u015fme, which is also in U\u015fak Province, is famous for its kilims. ==Twin cities== * Offenbach - Germany * Nur-Sultan - Kazakhstan * Besni - Turkey * Charleroi - Belgium ==See also== * Ushak carpet * Karun Treasure * U\u015fak Museum of Archaeology ==References== Category:Populated places in U\u015fak Province Category:Cities in Turkey Category:Districts of U\u015fak Province Category:Landforms of U\u015fak Province ",
