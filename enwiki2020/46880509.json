The human resources manager Ma Mei- ching, had unconsidered her for the position after seeing she was late to the interview and had unimpressive work experience. However office manager Gin Keung Yung (Nancy Wu) comes to May's defense when the human resource manager loudly mocks May in front of others. Gin points out the flaws of the other applicants and deems them unpresentable for the receptionist job. With Gin's comments about the other applicants, May is hired on the spot against the human resource manager's wishes. GSZ Architects Limited's office manager Gin is feared and respected by all at the office. She has been in love with architect Michael Mai Hoi-long (Moses Chan) for many years, and she drops hints about her feelings for him hoping he will know how she feels, but Michael is too involved in his work to notice Gin and only thinks of her as an extra supportive co-worker. Gin has patiently waited and supported Michael for many years hoping when he receives the recognition he desperately seeks for his designs, he will put his work behind him and finally notice her. May gets fired on her first day at work when she is blamed for Michael losing a design award. However, due to her stupidity earlier in the day, while comparing her counterfeit designer handbag to Gin's almost identical authentic designer handbag, she confusedly switches their handbags and is forced to return to the office later that night to return Gin's handbag. While talking on the phone with Gin to obtain the office tower's entry pin number, Gin gets electrocuted to death on May's dangerously high voltage counterfeit cellphone. One year later May is chased by debt collectors for a loan she got for her con-artist boyfriend Wong Tai-lung. When the police calls her to collect her handbag that was previously in Gin's possession, she desperately uses the counterfeit cellphone that killed Gin to try to call authorities when the debt collectors trap her. Upon opening and recharging the counterfeit cellphone Gin's spirit comes alive. May unnoticeably brings home the counterfeit cellphone knowing that she had seen Gin's ghost. She slowly figures out that the counterfeit cellphone is somehow connected to Gin's spirit coming alive. May's curiosity gets the better of her and she decides to recharge the counterfeit cellphone again just to see if Gin will come out again. After May finds out that she is the only one that can see or hear Gin and that Gin cannot venture far away from the counterfeit cellphone, Gin uses May's responsibility for her death to have her take her to GSZ Architects Limited's office because she wants to see Michael.
