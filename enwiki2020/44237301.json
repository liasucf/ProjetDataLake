He is best known for creating the role of Mr. Redburn in the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd at the Royal Opera House, London, on 1 December 1951.

He also taught on the voice faculty at the Royal College of Music and worked as a lay vicar at Westminster Abbey. ==Early life and career== Born in Whitstable, Alan first studied engineering at Medway University Technical College before pursuing studies in vocal music in London with Percival Driver, Mabel Kelly, and celebrated baritone Roy Henderson.

On 1 December 1951 Alan created the role of Mr. Redburn in the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's landmark work Billy Budd at the Royal Opera House, London. From 1952-1963 he performed frequently with the Welsh National Opera, including the roles of Federico Barbarossa in La battaglia di Legnano, Melchtal in William Tell, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in Faust, Procida in I vespri siciliani, Sparafucile in Rigoletto, and a much lauded portrayal of Zaccaria in Verdi's Nabucco.
