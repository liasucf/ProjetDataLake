    "text": "Radu \u015etefan Maz\u0103re (born July 5, 1968) is a Romanian politician. His political activity began with his election to the lower house of the Parliament on the Democratic Party list, which he left in 1997 to serve as an independent. In 2000 he defeated all party-supported contestants to be elected mayor of Constan\u021ba, one of Romania's largest cities and its foremost seaport. Joining the Social Democratic Party in 2003, he went on to win the following three elections with a comfortable majority. In 2015, during his fourth term, Maz\u0103re resigned amid accusations of corruption, citing the unbearable stress caused by what he claimed to be politically motivated investigations. In 2017 he fled while under bail to Madagascar, claiming the right of asylum, but he was extradited back to Romania on 20 May 2019 to serve a 9-year sentence in prison. ==Education== He is a graduate of the \"Mircea cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n\" Naval Academy (Electromechanics Department) in Constan\u021ba, class of 1991. ==Career== Maz\u0103re founded the Telegraf newspaper, the local Neptun TV channel and was a shareholder of the Conpress Holding. He joined the Democratic Party (PD) and was elected to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies in 1996. He later resigned due to \"differences between electoral promises and [the] realities of government\". ==Controversies== He is considered one of the top 300 richest people in Romania and was accused of being a so-called \"local baron\" of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). In November 2008, The Diplomat reported that the National Anti-corruption Department had accused Maz\u0103re, along with 36 other municipal employees, of corruption, abuse of public service, forgery, and criminal complicity. The group was charged with giving \u20ac114 million ($144 million) worth of state-owned land along the coast of the Black Sea and public beaches in Constanta and Mamaia to individuals, including Maz\u0103re's family. Maz\u0103re was awarded 5,000 Romanian Lei in damages after the Anti-corruption Department refused to provide information about the qualification of the experts. Another controversial event took place in July 2009 when, during a fashion show, Radu Maz\u0103re participated wearing a Nazi Wehrmacht uniform, together with his son, who was also wearing a Nazi uniform. He explained that he \"always liked this uniform, and admired the rigorous organization of the German army\". According to Maz\u0103re, \"I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it\". Two days later he issued a public apology to Jewish organisations, declaring that by wearing the uniform he wanted to pay homage to Claus von Stauffenberg, a leading member of the failed plot to kill Adolf Hitler during World War II. Radu Maz\u0103re in the year 2003 introduced the \"tax for increasing the degree of peace and security in carrying out economic activities in Constan\u021ba, Mamaia and Sat Vacan\u0163a\" (taxa pentru cre\u0219terea gradului de lini\u0219te \u0219i siguran\u021b\u0103 \u00een derularea activit\u0103\u021bilor economice \u00een Constan\u021ba, Mamaia \u0219i Sat Vacan\u021b\u0103). This tax was attacked and canceled by the prefect of Constan\u021ba county D\u0103nu\u021b Cule\u021bu in 2006. Although this tax was considered abusive, it was reintroduced in disagreement with 31337 debtors from Constanta, in 2009. Among the population, this tax was also called: \"Maz\u0103re's Protection tax\" or \u201dThe Al Capone Tax\u201d. The tax remained uncontested until 2015, when the president of the ACIA, civic activist Andrei Popescu, initiated a campaign to collect signatures to end this abuse. The campaign had a real support from the people of Constanta, gathering over 7,000 signatories. In early 2015, Maz\u0103re was placed under indictment and investigated for corruption-related offenses by the National Anticorruption Directorate. In July 2017, after nine years of trial, Maz\u0103re was convicted and given a three-year suspended sentence for the illegal sales. At the end of 2017 Maz\u0103re fled to Madagascar, where he owns a holiday resort, asking for the right of asylum. In May 2018, Maz\u0103re received a six and a half-year prison sentence for abuse of power in a case related to the sale of a 15,000 sqm-plot of land in the Mamaia resort, subject to appeal. Subsequently, on 8 February 2019, Maz\u0103re was handed a final 9-year imprisonment sentence in the Mamaia affair. In May 2019 he was repatriated to Romania under an international warrant, to serve 9 years in prison. ==See also== * List of corruption scandals in Romania ==Footnotes== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of places in Romania Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Social Democratic Party (Romania) politicians Category:People from Bucharest Category:Romanian white-collar criminals Category:People extradited to Romania ",
