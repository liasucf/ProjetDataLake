    "text": "Bakke Church () is a parish church in Trondheim municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It is located in the Bakklandet area of the city of Trondheim, and the church serves the Bakklandet, M\u00f8llenberg, Rosenborg, and Nedre Elvehavn areas of \u00d8stbyen in Trondheim. It is one of the churches for the Bakklandet og Lademoen parish which is part of the Nidaros domprosti (arch- deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The red, octagonal, wooden church was built in 1715 and it was designed by the architect Johan Christopher Hempel (died 1729). The church seats about 400 people. It is the oldest building in the Bakklandet area of Trondheim since it was the only building that was spared during the Swedish siege of 1718. After World War I, the Innherredsveien road (the old European route E6 highway) was widened and upgraded and the church was located too close to and the church became a major traffic obstruction. This led to plans to demolish the church, especially after the opening of the new Bakke bridge in 1927. It was decided to save the church, so the whole church was jacked up with a jack and moved several feet to the side in 1939. Then it was restored and consecrated again in 1941. Although the building is owned by the Church of Norway, the state Lutheran church, Bakke Church is also used by Trondheim's small Eastern Orthodox Church congregation, who do not possess their own church building. ==Media gallery== Bakke Kirke.jpg|Exterior view Bakke kirke ved 250-\u00e5rs jubileet (1965).jpg|Interior view (1965) \"Da s\u00e5 Jesus p\u00e5 ham og fikk ham kj\u00e6r\" - Utgangsd\u00f8ren i Bakke kirke.jpg| Interi\u00f8r i Bakke kirke (f\u00f8r 1939).jpg|Interior (before 1939) Bakke kirke f\u00f8r flytting i 1939.jpg|Exterior view (in 1939 before it was moved) Bakke kirke f\u00f8r flyttingen i 1939.jpg|Exterior view (in 1939 before it was moved) Krysset Innherredsveien Nonnegata med Bakke kirke (1962) (8691603737).jpg|Exterior view (in 1962, after the church was moved in order to widen the road) ==See also== *List of churches in Nidaros ==References== Category:Churches in Trondheim Category:Churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Octagonal churches in Norway Category:Churches completed in 1715 Category:1715 establishments in Norway Category:18th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Russian Orthodox church buildings in Norway ",
