    "text": "Port Alberni Mill is a pulp mill and paper mill located in the Canadian town of Port Alberni, British Columbia, on the edge of the Alberni Inlet. Part of Catalyst Paper, the mill has two paper machines which produce 340,000 tonnes annually. One machine produces 116,000 tonnes of directory paper, the other 224,000 tonnes of lightweight coated paper. The mill has 324 employees as of 2014. The mill was established by Bloedel, Stewart and Welch in 1946, originally operating only a kraft pulp mill. This came by after an injunction by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, who prohibited the use of the sulfite process. In addition to being the first significant new BC mill in decades, it was the first BC mill to integrate residuals from sawmills. By way of merger, ownership passed to MacMillan Bloedel in 1951. The two paper machines were installed in 1957, at first producing newsprint. Ownership passed to Pacifica Papers in 1998, Norske Skog Canada in 2000 and Catalyst Paper in 2005. ==References== Category:Pulp and paper mills in British Columbia Category:Port Alberni Category:1946 establishments in British Columbia Category:MacMillan Bloedel Category:Norske Skog Category:Catalyst Paper ",
