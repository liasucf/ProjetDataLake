    "text": "Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser (June 19, 1806 \u2013 March 11, 1875) was an Austrian- Hungarian magician and illusionist. He used the moniker \"Dr. Hofzinser\" as a stage name after retiring in 1865. Ottokar Fischer spread the story that upon his death in 1875, Hofzinser's wife destroyed many of his manuscripts to honor her husband's instructions though there is some dispute about this. Many of his mechanical plans and card-handling methods may forever remain a secret. Several of Hofzinser's pupils preserved portions of their teacher's notes and instructions. There are still about 270 manuscripts and letters of his own and of his pupils in various collections. He is portrayed by Philip McGough,in the 2006 movie The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti. == References == * Randi, James.
