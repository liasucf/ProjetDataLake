    "text": "Allenanthus was a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae but is no longer recognized. It has been sunk into synonymy with Machaonia. ==Taxonomy== Allenanthus was named by Paul Standley in 1940 in Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.Standley PC. 1940. Allenanthus pages 344-346. In: Woodson RE, Schery RW. \"Contributions toward a flora of Panama\". Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 27(3):265-364. It was named in honor of Paul Hamilton Allen (1911-1963). Until 2004, two species had been recognized, but fieldwork has shown that there is a continuum of variation between them. Comparisons of morphological characters and DNA sequences have shown that Allenanthus is embedded in Machaonia. This was confirmed by a molecular phylogenetic study of the subfamily Cinchonoideae in 2010. Because of these results, Allenanthus is no longer maintained as a separate genus. ==Species== * Allenanthus erythrocarpus Standl. * Allenanthus hondurensis Standl. ==References== ==External links== * World Checklist of Rubiaceae * Allenanthus At: Plant Names At: IPNI * Allenanthus In: Volume 27 Of: AMBG At: Biodiversity Heritage Library * Allenanthus At: Index Nominum Genericorum At: References At: NMNH Department of Botany At: Research and Collections At: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History * Allenanthus At: Guettardeae At: Cinchonoideae At: Rubiaceae In: Embryophyta At: Streptophytina At: Streptophyta At: Viridiplantae At: Eukaryota At: Taxonomy At: UniProt Category:Guettardeae Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Historically recognized Rubiaceae genera ",
