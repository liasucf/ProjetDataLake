Krishnan was a follower of Sree Narayana Guru. He was a leader of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam and was active in organizing the meetings of the northern Malabar district his area of Kerala. He participated in many SNDP yogam conventions and chaired its 9th anniversary at sivagiri along with the consecration ceremony of \u2018Sharada\u2019 temple there.

In 1907 Krishnan (along with Rarichan Moopan of the famous Kallingal Madom) invited Sree Narayana Guru to Malabar. The guru accepted the invitation and visited many places in Malabar. C. Krishnan however did not support the freedom movement, and was against the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi. He supported the British rule because he believed that freedom for rule without freedom from serfdom was meaningless. He blamed Gandhiji for his failure to prevent the Malabar rebellion. He was suspicious of the national freedom that would be won without putting an end to the social inequalities. He wanted the freedom of the oppressed classes to be attained before the nation achieved freedom. == See also == * Sree Narayana Guru * Dr. Palpu * Kumaranasan * Rao Sahib Dr. Ayyathan Gopalan * Moorkoth Kumaran * Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi * Vaghbhatananda gurudevar ==References== ==External links== * Sree Narayana Association * Blog on C.
