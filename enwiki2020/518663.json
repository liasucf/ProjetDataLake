Having graduated from the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music, she was affiliated with Production Baobab at the time of her death. ==Career== Kawakami debuted in 1994 as a role of a boy in Metal Fighter Miku. Her first regular performance was in 1995 as Chiriko in Fushigi Yuugi. Two years after, she landed her first starring voice role as Utena Tenjou in Revolutionary Girl Utena. Aside from Chiriko and Utena, her famous roles are in Air (Misuzu Kamio), Bleach (Soifon), Chrono Crusade (Rosette Christopher), Hikaru no Go (Hikaru Shindo), Sgt.

The best-known genre of her roles are tomboyish characters (Soifon, Utena Tenjou). With such a powerful voice, she was often affiliated in paranormal and yuri-themed anime. She also made her name voicing the heroine in the Harukanaru Toki no Naka de series, based from the Neoromance game with the same title produced by Koei in 2000. ===Illness and death=== In August 2008, Kawakami was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which required surgery. During a three-year battle with cancer, most of her ongoing roles were replaced by other voice actresses, although the latter was able to do some voice work until her retirement in the start of the 2010's decade. She died on June 9, 2011 at the age of 41. ==Filmography== ===Television animation=== * Air - Misuzu Kamio * Amaenaideyo!! - Sumi Ikuina * A Little Snow Fairy Sugar - Sugar * Angelic Layer - Madoka Fujisaki * Aria - Athena Glory * Ashita no Nadja - Shudefan * Battle Athletes Victory - Chris Christopher * Best Student Council - Cyndi Manabe * Betterman - S\u0113me * Bleach - Soifon (Episode 24 - 205) * Cardcaptor Sakura - Rika Sasaki * Chrono Crusade - Rosette Christopher * Clannad - Girl from the Illusionary World * Crush Gear Turbo - Yamano Kimomo * Cyborg 009 - Cynthia * Darker than BLACK - Amber * Dear Boys - Yukiko Kawasaki * Descendants of Darkness - Kazusa Otonashi * Detective School Q - Kazuma Narusawa * Di Gi Charat Nyo! - Chibi Akari, Kareida-san * Doki Doki School Hours - Akane Kobayashi * Elfen Lied - Mariko * F-Zero GP Legend - Sasuke Reina * Fullmetal Alchemist - Kyle (in episode 9) * Fushigi Y\u00fbgi, Fushigi Y\u016bgi Oni, and Fushigi Y\u016bgi Eikoden - Chiriko * Gakuen Heaven - Satoshi Umino * Gaiking - Lulu * Gakko no Kaidan - Satsuki Miyanoshita * Genesis of Aquarion - Futaba * Great Teacher Onizuka - Hoshino (in episode 28) * Godannar - Luna * Harukanaru Toki no Naka de - Akane Motomiya * Hikaru no Go - Hikaru Shind\u014d * I'm Gonna Be An Angel! - Noelle * Jigoku Sh\u014djo - Yoshimi Kuroda (in episode 1) * Jibaku-kun - Pink * Jinki: Extend - Elnie Tachibana * Kanon - Sayuri Kurata * Kara no Ky\u014dkai - Ryougi Shiki (Drama CD) * Magical Project S - Konoha Haida/Funky Connie * Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple - Miu F\u016brinji * Martian Successor Nadesico - Eri, Ai * MegaMan NT Warrior - Princess Pride * Mirmo! - Wakaba * Mon Colle Knights - Fear\u012b * NieA 7 - K\u0101na * Nodame Cantabile - Elise (main story in anime), Puririn (Purigorota) * One Piece - Amanda * Onegai My Melody - Klat * Orphen: Revenge - Licorice Nelson * Paranoia Agent - \"Otokomichi/A Man's Path\" manga heroine (Episode 4) * Piano: The Melody of a Young Girl's Heart - Y\u016bki Matsubara * Pocket Monsters - Ayame, Takami, Hikari's Mimirol, Pok\u00e9dex (Sinnoh region) * Popotan - Mai/Konami * Power Stone - Ayame * Rune Soldier - Merrill * Revolutionary Girl Utena - Utena Tenj\u014d * Saiyuki Reload series - Lirin * Saru Get You -On Air- - Natsumi * Sgt.
