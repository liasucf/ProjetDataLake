    "text": "Any Dream Will Do, is a 2007 talent show-themed television series produced by the BBC in the United Kingdom. It searched for a new, unknown lead to play Joseph in a West End revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The show was hosted by Graham Norton, who announced Lee Mead as the winner of the final public telephone vote on 9 June 2007. It was the second West-End talent show to be produced by the BBC/Andrew Lloyd Webber, after How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?. Further talent shows in the series have aired, with I'd Do Anything completing in 2008 and Over the Rainbow which ran in April/May 2010. Andrew LIoyd Webber, Zoe Tyler & John Barrowman Returned as panelist\u2019s and Graham Norton Returned to host the show. A similar format has been used as well in The Netherlands in 2008, with the show Op zoek naar Joseph (Looking for Joseph) taking an unknown singer and placing the winner in the lead role for the 2009 performances in The Netherlands. On 26 October 2008, Freek Bartels was announced the winner of this show. ==Format== Commissioned after the success of the similar BBC series How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, the series followed the same format to find a new, unknown lead for a revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The series was named after the song from the musical, \"Any Dream Will Do\". ===Expert panel=== David Ian did not appear on this show and was replaced by Bill Kenwright. An expert panel provided advice to the contestants throughout the series, and provided comments during the live shows. As they appeared on screen from right to left, the panel was made up of: * Zoe Tyler, vocal coach to the contestants (vocal coach, singer and performer) * Bill Kenwright (theatre producer and co-producer of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the Adelphi Theatre) * Denise Van Outen (musical theatre actress and television presenter) who later went on to date and marry winner Lee Mead. * John Barrowman (musical theatre and television actor) * Andrew Lloyd Webber, head judge and composer of Joseph. (Presenter Graham Norton referred to him differently each week, mostly using variations of \"Lord\" phrases. When he was announced as part of the expert panel, the chandeliers behind him flashed and a few bars from The Phantom of the Opera rang out. Usually, Lloyd Webber showed mock embarrassment or surprise, while John and Denise feigned either fright or worship of him.) ===Auditions=== The first week of the show documented the initial auditions where one hundred hopefuls, from thousands, were called back to London. This was further whittled-down by the panel of judges to fifty contestants who would enter Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Joseph School\". However, two additional entrants were selected over this fifty contestant limit after they went to Lloyd Webber's personal studio for a second audition. In the second week, the fifty individuals selected attended \"Joseph School\" where the coaches worked on singing, acting and choreography with the contestants. Former Joseph actor Jason Donovan, amongst others, visited to lend his advice and support for them. On the second day, one contestant left the competition, twenty-three were eliminated and only twenty eight remained. On the third day, another eight men were eliminated, leaving only twenty contestants in the competition. These men were taken to Lloyd Webber's castle in Ireland, where they performed live in front of a packed house of locals and industry professionals including Louis Walsh. The best twelve were then taken through to the live studio finals. ==Finalists== Graham Norton and the twelve contestants each wearing their 'dreamcoat', symbolically handed back once they were eliminated. Those pictured are (clockwise from top left) Chris B, Antony, Chris C, host Graham Norton, Keith, Lewis, Ben, Johndeep, Daniel, Seamus, Craig, Lee and Rob. Twelve potential Josephs were chosen, each wearing a unique coloured coat. At the end of every live show, the Joseph who was eliminated had his coat stripped off whilst singing a song of farewell (a combination of \"Poor, Poor Joseph\" and \"Close Every Door to Me\"). {| class=\"wikitable\" !

Each week the \"Josephs\" were set various singing and performing tasks each week. They were introduced with clips summarising their past week before performing a solo song and hearing comments from the panel. Each week they also performed two group songs, one from Joseph at the start of each show and one after the solo performances. All the performances were live in front of a studio audience, with a live band headed by Nigel Wright and backing singers. Every week, a Joseph was eliminated from the competition. The public got a chance to vote for their favourite Joseph by calling in after all the finalists' solo performances. The two Josephs with the fewest votes in a given week performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd-Webber, who then decided which contestant to keep, based upon how well he felt that contender would fill the Joseph role. The eliminated Joseph then performed \"Poor, Poor Joseph/Close Every Door\" together with the remaining Josephs as his grand exit song, symbolically handing back his dreamcoat. ===Week 1 (14 April 2007)=== * Theme- No1s *Group performances: **\"Any Dream Will Do\" **\"Luck Be a Lady\" (from Guys and Dolls) {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the first live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Result |- ! scope=\"row\" | Rob McVeigh | 1 | \"Summer of '69\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 2 | \"Mack the Knife\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 3 | \"Faith\" | Safe |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Ben Ellis | 4 | \"Johnny B.

In the sing-off, they had to sing \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" by The Hollies. Ben was saved by Lloyd Webber due to his emotional performance and Seamus was sent home. Upon being asked whether he was surprised that he was being sent home, Seamus said: \"The words 'conspiracy theory' spring to mind\" (Although he later implied he may have been joking). Then, during his farewell song, he changed the line \"I have been promised a land of my own\" to \"I have been promised a of my own.\" ===Week 4 (5 May 2007)=== * Theme-Rock N Roll *Group performances: **\"Song of the King\" **\"Dead Ringer For Love\" (Meat Loaf) *Mission: **Climbing the barricade and singing \"Do You Hear The People Sing\" from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the fourth live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Results |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | Ben Ellis | 1 | \"Addicted to Love\" | Safe |- style = \"background:lightblue\" ! scope=\"row\" | Craig Chalmers | 2 | \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\" | Bottom 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 3 | \"All Right Now\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Keith Jack | 4 | \"Love Is All Around\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 5 | \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Rob McVeigh | | 6 | \"Back for Good\" | Safe |- style = \"background:pink\" ! scope=\"row\" | Chris Barton | 7 | \"All Night Long\" | Eliminated |- ! scope=\"row\" | Daniel Boys | 8 | \"All About You\" | Safe |- |} *Panel's verdict on who was not Joseph **John Barrowman: Lewis Bradley **Denise Van Outen: Rob McVeigh **Bill Kenwright: Rob McVeigh **Zoe Tyler: Lee Mead *Sing-off: **The bottom two were Chris Barton and Craig Chalmers, with Chris receiving the lowest number of votes from the public. In the sing-off, they had to sing The Beatles song \"The Long and Winding Road\". Lloyd Webber chose to save Craig and send Chris home. It is generally considered a disappointment that Lloyd Webber chose Craig over Chris. Lloyd Webber also said that a West End audience would not have the confidence to watch Chris in performance, which fans have negatively regarded as rude. Prior to the farewell song, Graham Norton asked Chris who he thought was going to win the competition; Chris chose Lewis. ===Week 5 (12 May 2007)=== *Group performances: **\"One More Angel in Heaven\" **\"You Really Got Me\" (The Kinks) *Mission: **Practising being aggressive with John Barrowman {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the fifth live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Results |- |- style = \"background:pink\" ! scope=\"row\" | Rob McVeigh | 1 | \"Born to Run\" | Eliminated |- ! scope=\"row\" | Daniel Boys | 2 | \"Maggie May\" | Safe |- style = \"background:lightblue\" ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 3 | \"I'm a Believer\" | Bottom 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 4 | \"Leave Right Now\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Craig Chalmers | 5 | \"This is the Moment\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Ben Ellis | | 6 | \"Help Yourself\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Keith Jack | 7 | \"Always on My Mind\" | Safe |- |} *Panel's verdict on who was not Joseph **John Barrowman: Rob McVeigh **Denise Van Outen: Rob McVeigh **Bill Kenwright: Rob McVeigh **Zoe Tyler: Daniel Boys *Sing-off: **The bottom two were Rob McVeigh and Lewis Bradley, with Rob receiving the lowest number of votes from the public.

In the sing-off, they had to sing \"Bring Him Home\" from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables. Lloyd Webber chose to save Lewis and send Daniel home, although both Graham Norton and the panel expressed shock that Daniel was sent home much earlier than had been expected of him. ===Week 7 (26 May 2007)=== *Theme: The Five Themes of Joseph (Dreaming, Vulnerability, Betrayal, Courage and Arrogance) One of the finalists was chosen by Josh Groban to perform \"You Raise Me Up\" with him live in front of the audience. Lee Mead was the lucky one while the remaining four were back-up singers. *Group performances: **\"A Pharaoh Story\" **\"Do You Love Me\" (The Contours) **\"Born to Be Wild\" (Steppenwolf) **Lee Mead & The Josephs with Josh Groban: \"You Raise Me Up\" *Mission: **Falling from heights to show courage {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the seventh live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Results |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 1 | \"Daydream Believer\" | Safe |- style = \"background:lightblue\" ! scope=\"row\" | Ben Ellis | 2 | \"Crying\" | Bottom 2 |- style = \"background:pink\" ! scope=\"row\" | Craig Chalmers | 3 | \"Suspicious Minds\" | Eliminated |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 4 | \"Hero\" | Safe |- ! scope=\"row\" | Keith Jack | 5 | \"Let Me Entertain You\" | Safe |- |} *Panel's verdict on who was not Joseph **John Barrowman: Lewis Bradley **Denise Van Outen: Lewis Bradley **Bill Kenwright: Ben Ellis **Zoe Tyler: Ben Ellis *Sing- off: **The bottom two were Ben Ellis and Craig Chalmers, with Ben receiving the lowest number of votes from the public.

Again announced in sets of two, the contestants performed duets of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs with another Joseph in addition to their solo performance. At the end of the show, the three finalists were announced. *Group performances: **\"Jacob & Sons/Joseph's Coat\" **Keith and Ben: \"I am the Starlight\" (from Starlight Express) **Lewis and Lee: \"Oh What a Circus\" (from Evita) **\"Under Pressure\" (Queen & David Bowie) *Mission: **Having a tour of at the backstage of the lord of the rings west end theatre {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the eighth live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Results |- ! scope=\"row\" | Keith Jack | 1 | \"Could It Be Magic\" | Safe |- style = \"background:pink\" ! scope=\"row\" | Ben Ellis | 2 | \"Ease on Down the Road\" | Eliminated |- |- style = \"background:lightblue\" ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 3 | \"Sweet Caroline\" | Bottom Two |- ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 4 | \"Livin' on a Prayer\" | Safe |- |} *Panel's verdict on who was not Joseph **John Barrowman: Lewis Bradley **Denise Van Outen: Lewis Bradley **Bill Kenwright: Ben Ellis **Zoe Tyler: Ben Ellis *Sing-off: **The bottom two were Ben Ellis and Lewis Bradley, with Ben receiving the lowest number of votes from the public. In the sing-off, they had to sing \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables. Lloyd Webber chose to save Lewis and send Ben home. Ben later said he was disappointed in the panel's comments regarding his performance that week, but nevertheless accepted his elimination graciously. ===Week 9 (8 June 2007)=== The final, held on 9 June 2007, featured three songs from each of the Josephs: in addition to their regular performance, each performed a big band number and the final two repeated their favourite song from the series. The opening song was performed by all 12 Josephs, supported by the winner of a national Joseph Choir search \u2013 the choir of East Ham's Brampton Primary School in east London. *Group performances: **All Josephs with the Brampton Primary School Choir: \"Go, Go, Go Joseph\" **Lee, Keith and Lewis: \"Maria\" (from West Side Story) **The Former Josephs: \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" (Thin Lizzy) **Keith and Lee: \"Superstar\" (from Jesus Christ Superstar) {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Contestants' performances on the ninth live show ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Big Band Song ! scope=\"col\" | Order ! scope=\"col\" | Previous Song ! scope=\"col\" | Result |- style=\"background:pink;\" ! scope=\"row\" | Lewis Bradley | 1 | \"Kiss\" | 4 | \"Beyond the Sea\" | N/A | N/A (already eliminated) | Eliminated |- style = \"background:#ff9\" ! scope=\"row\" | Keith Jack | 2 | \"For Once in My Life\" | 5 | \"Moondance\" | 7 | \"Always on My Mind\" | Runner-up |- style = \"background:lightgreen\" ! scope=\"row\" | Lee Mead | 3 | \"(You're The) Devil in Disguise\" | 6 | \"Theme from New York, New York\" | 8 | \"Paint It Black\" | Winner |} The success of the programme prompted the BBC to extend the series by an extra week (week nine), removing the need for a double eviction prior to the final. The new date for the final, 9 June 2007, ensured it would air directly opposite the final of ITV's competing show, Grease is the Word. This move paid off as the final of Any Dream Will Do managed to secure the upper hand over Grease is the Word in viewing figures with a peak of 8.5 million viewers and an audience share of 39.6%, compared with ITV's high of 4.9 million viewers (an audience share of 23.5%). In the final, over three million votes were cast with Lee Mead being announced as the winner. He sang \"Any Dream Will Do\" to close the series and his prize was six months in the lead role of a revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in London's West End. ==After the series== ===Winner=== Before the opening night of Joseph at London's Adelphi Theatre, publicity from the TV show had brought in \u00a310 million in advance ticket sales, leading to a five-month extension to the show's run and an extension of Mead's contract until June 2008.Really Useful/See Tickets . Retrieved 3 July 2007. Mead's version of \"Any Dream Will Do\", along with \"Close Every Door\" performed by the three finalists, was released as a single to raise money for BBC Children in Need. It reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. His first public performance after the win was on 1 July 2007 at the Concert for Diana at London's Wembley Stadium, where he sang \"Any Dream Will Do\" with former Joseph actors Donny Osmond and Jason Donovan. Mead, along with the winner, Connie Fisher and last five runners-up of the previous Lloyd-Webber reality show How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? starred in a one-off Christmas Eve special on BBC One entitled When Joseph Met Maria.Pick Of The Day | |What's on TV \u2013 Britain's best TV listings, storylines, news and video from soaps like EastEnders ===Other finalists=== Fifth-placed Craig Chalmers was cast by Bill Kenwright as Joseph in the touring version of Joseph from 20 August 2007. The tour was due to have its first night in Bromley, London, less than 24 km (about 15 miles) from the Adelphi, where Kenwright was co-producer. In Chalmers' last week before viewers voted him off the programme, Kenwright had told him: \"You wowed the audience and please God you are here next week for the semi-final.\" Chris Barton played Benjamin on the tour and at some matinees Joseph or the Narrator. He then went on to be a Swing in Spring Awakening in both Hammersmith and the Novello west end. Kenwright employed Chris Crosby on his new national tour of Half a Sixpence opening on 28 August 2007 at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley. Keith Jack joined the cast of the touring Joseph production with Craig and Chris Barton. He played the Narrator, a part usually played by a woman though originally written for a male voice. His first official performance was on 1 October in Plymouth although he performed a couple of the final shows in High Wycombe on 28 and 29 September. He has now finished playing this role.
