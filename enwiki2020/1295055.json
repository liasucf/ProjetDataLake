    "text": "Terence Patrick Dicks (17 March 1937 \u2013 17 June 2020) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was MP for the constituency of Hayes and Harlington from 1983 to his retirement in 1997, having unsuccessfully contested Bristol South in 1979, when he lost to Labour's Michael Cocks. Dicks had the distinction in the 1979 general election of being the only Conservative candidate in the whole South of England outside London to be defeated by a Labour candidate with a five figure majority, he was beaten with a majority of 11,183. He obtained the nickname Phil for, according to The Telegraph, \"elevating Philistinism to an art form\". ==Early life and career== Dicks was born in Bristol on 17 March 1937 with cerebral palsy. His early jobs included work at Imperial Tobacco as a clerk until 1959. He was educated at the University of Oxford (DipEcon) and the London School of Economics (BSc (Econ)).\u2018DICKS, Terence Patrick, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014. ==Political career== ===Outside Parliament=== Dicks was elected to Hillingdon Borough Council in 1974. In 1978 he attracted controversy after treating a white Rhodesian family differently to an Asian family, despite the fact that both had arrived in the UK as immigrants. He was suspended in 1982 when the Greater London Council took issue with comments he made regarding arrears from the Strongbridge Housing Association. Dicks was selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for the seat of Bristol South in the 1979 general election, but he lost out to Labour's Michael Cocks. From 1999 until he retired in June 2009, Dicks was a member of Surrey County Council, representing the town of Addlestone. Beginning in 2011, he was a Runnymede district councillor for Chertsey South and Row Town. ===Member of Parliament=== Dicks was elected as the Member of Parliament for Hayes and Harlington in 1983 in succession to Neville Sandelson. He was known for his hardline right-wing views and caused controversy over several public statements he made. His strong opposition to state funding for the arts inspired Labour MP Tony Banks to claim, in a February 1990 debate, that Dicks' presence in the House of Commons was \"living proof that a pig's bladder on a stick can get elected to Parliament.\"Iain Dale \"The Right Hon wag\", The Guardian, 10 January 2006. In another arts funding debate in July that year, his remarks were controversial enough for fellow Conservative MP Patrick Cormack, in a heated House of Commons, to say, \"This man is a disgrace to the House of Commons.\" Dicks replied, \"My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South (Cormack) reminds me of Henry VIII not with all the doublet and hose, but at least well fed.\" Regarding Derrick Gregory, a mentally subnormal man who had been sentenced to death in Malaysia for drug smuggling, Dicks said he would be writing to the Malaysian government congratulating it on its approach. On Farzad Bazoft, an Observer journalist hanged by Saddam Hussein in 1990, Dicks said he \"deserved to be hanged\" on the eve of his execution.Leader, The Observer, 18 March 1990. In 1990, when Nelson Mandela declined to meet the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a trip to London, a greatly offended Dicks asked, rhetorically, \"How much longer will the Prime Minister allow herself to be kicked in the face by this black terrorist?\" Dicks, unfaltering in this belief, further insisted that the African National Congress \"were just terrorists\", adding \"a terrorist is a terrorist. I don't accept this view of freedom fighters one day \u2013 terrorists one day, freedom fighters the next. No. No. And if they had wanted to they could have executed him. Seriously. Then you wouldn't have had all this fuss of 'I can live 27 years in prison.'\" These remarks returned to light in 2013, in the wake of Mandela's death, to the embarrassment of Conservative leader David Cameron, who had \"hoped to bury the Tories' anti-Mandela past.\" As an MP and a member of the Conservative Family Campaign, Dicks left a legacy as a critic of high-profile HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns at the time of the emergence of the disease in the 1980s. Frequent controversial jokes furthering these opinions and others \u2013 such as suggesting \"tell 'em that if you shove your willy [British slang term for a penis] up someone's bum you're going to catch more than a cold\" as a central message of the government's HIV/AIDS campaign (instead of encouraging gay men to use condoms), descriptions of immigrants to Britain as \"the flotsam and jetsam from all over the world,\" and ridiculing a Somali refugee family buying water in a west London supermarket, saying \"where they come from they're happy to drink out of puddles\" \u2013 fuelled protests and made himself an easy target for Labour jibes when he retired in 1997. His Labour successor, left-winger John McDonnell, described him as a \"stain,\" a \"malignant creature,\" and an espouser of racism in his maiden speech. Dicks called for the BBC soap opera EastEnders to be cancelled, following a storyline involving a gay kiss between two men. He was supportive of measures to decrease periods for abortion. ==Personal life== Due to his cerebal palsy, Dicks referred to himself in the House of Commons as a \"spastic\".\"House of Commons Hansard\", Column 544, 11 May 1994. He had four children - three daughters and a son - across two marriages. He died on 17 June 2020, aged 83.Remembrance of departed colleagues, politicshome.com; accessed 17 June 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1937 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Members of Surrey County Council Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:People with cerebral palsy Category:People from Bristol Category:Members of the Greater London Council ",
