    "text": "The Beach Chalet is a two-story Spanish colonial revival style building at the far western end of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. ==History== The building was designed by Willis Polk and opened in 1925 in as a city-run restaurant and included changing rooms for beach visitors. It replaced an older building called the Golden Gate Park Chalet, built in 1892, that had stood on the opposite side of the Great Highway. ===Murals=== Elaborate murals painted by Lucien Adolphe Labaudt were added to the first floor as a 1936 Works Progress Administration project. The murals depict real people and scenes from San Francisco in the 1930s. After World War II the city leased the Beach Chalet to the Veterans of Foreign Wars for $50 a month. A 1952 \"smoker\" featured gambling, strippers and lewd films; arrested in connection with this was Salvatore (Tarbaby) Terrano of the Waxey Gordon narcotics ring. The VFW moved out after the city bumped the rent to $500 a month in 1979. The Mural room is now the San Francisco Visitor's Center.

Its sister restaurant, the Park Chalet, is located to the back of the Beach Chalet with a dining room facing the park and outdoor dining on a terrace and lawn area. \\+ It's important to remind all patrons to keep all valuables out of sight when parking their car in the Beach Chalet parking lot. There has been a city wide epidemic of thieves breaking into cars by smashing the windows. It occurs virtually every single day and night at Beach Chalet. Tourist rent a cars are especially vulnerable. ==References== Category:Golden Gate Park Category:Art in San Francisco Category:Restaurants in San Francisco Category:1925 establishments in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco ",
