    "text": "Under Lock and Key is the third studio album by heavy metal band Dokken, released on November 22, 1985 through Elektra Records. The album reached No. 32 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and remained on that chart for 67 weeks.[ \"Dokken \u2013 Chart history\"]. Billboard. Retrieved June 15, 2015. Two singles also charted: \"The Hunter\" and \"In My Dreams\", both reaching No. 25 and 24 on Billboards Mainstream Rock respectively, with \"In My Dreams\" at No. 77 on the Billboard Hot 100. Under Lock and Key was certified Gold on March 4, 1986 and Platinum on April 14, 1987. ==Critical reception== Eduardo Rivadavia in his review for AllMusic calls Under Lock and Key \"quite possibly Dokken's most 'complete' album, with a little something for every type of fan\", like \"fist- pumping headbangers\", extraordinary \"bittersweet mid-paced rockers\" (\"Unchain the Night\" and \"The Hunter\") and \"saccharine ballads\". Rivadavia recommends the album as the best introduction to new listeners of Dokken, but notes that heavy metal purists would likely prefer the band's 1984 album Tooth and Nail. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considers the album \"too weighted towards Def Leppard's fat-and-open formula rock\", resulting \"a bit subdued and predictable\" in comparison with its predecessor. The band's glamorous look, the media exposure and George Lynch's \"attempt to define the L.A. sound in his own image\" do not save Under Lock and Key from sounding \"like the work of a band just fed\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Dokken=== *Don Dokken \u2013 lead vocals *George Lynch \u2013 guitar *Jeff Pilson \u2013 bass, background vocals *Mick Brown \u2013 drums, background vocals ===Additional musicians=== *Chris Currell \u2013 Synclavier programming ===Production=== *Neil Kernon, Michael Wagener \u2013 producers, engineers, mixing *Mark Wilczak \u2013 assistant engineer and mixing *Cliff Bonell, Michael Lardie \u2013 assistant engineers *Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering at Masterdisk, New York ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\"|1985 |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (USA) |align=\"center\"|32 |- |align=\"center\"|1986 |align=\"center\"|RPM100 Albums (Canada) |align=\"center\"|95 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
