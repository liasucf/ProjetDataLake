Examples of combined words The lunar new year couplet pasted on a tsoo-tshu (\u7956\u539d). A pair of chunlian, a horizontal red scroll and two doufang hung on the door of a village house. Fai chun (\u63ee\u6625; pinyin: hu\u012bch\u016bn) is a traditional decoration that is frequently used during Chinese New Year. People put fai chun in the doorways to create jubilant festive atmosphere since the phrases written on it means good luck and prosperity. Customarily, fai chun is written by hand but owing to convenience, printed versions are mass-produced nowadays. fai chun is in either square or rectangular shape. It can be hung vertically or horizontally. Not only does it exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. ==History== Fai chun originated from taofu (\u6843\u7b26; peach wood charms) in ancient times. Peach wood charms are the long pieces of wood hung from peach trees. They are about seven to eight inches long and slightly more than one inch wide. According to the legend, there was a peach tree in the East China Sea that was the gate where the ghosts passed through between the underworld and the world of the living. Two gods, Shentu and Yulei, were responsible for guarding this gate. The ghosts travelling the world at night time were required to return to the underworld before the early morning. It was believed that the two gods could dispel all the demons which did harm to human at night time. People, therefore, used the peach wood to make two puppets of the two gods and put them at the entrance of their home in order to protect their family. Then, as early as the Han dynasty, people found that it was hard and complicated to make puppets, so they simplified the puppets to two peach wood boards on which they drew portraits of the gods. Later on, people simply wrote down the names of the gods on pieces of peach wood and hung them on both sides of the door. Around the Tang dynasty, commoners no longer wrote the names of the gods only but add some blessings to symbolize good fortune as well as express their hope and best wishes in the new year. Since Ming dynasty, pieces of peach wood were replaced by square red papers. There are another story which is related to Fai chun history. According to the legend, there was a monster lived in the deep sea and has a lion-like head and an ox-like body, who named Nian (\u5e74). When the time around New Year, it scared the villagers and eating their crops, livestock and even villagers. At one time, during a rampage, Nian was seen running away from a house which had a red shirt hanging outside and then later, from a light. Consequently, the villagers discovered that the monster was afraid of red color, loud noise and flaming light. Since then, before every New Year, people paste red couplets in and outside their house, let off firecrackers and firework, in order to scare the monster away. After Nian back to the sea, people would come out and celebrate for the New Year. This become a tradition every year, people keep pasting red couplets every year, which is called Fai chun now. ==Colour== Traditional fai chun is in bright red color with black or gold characters inscribed on it with a brush. Similar to the color of fire, red color was chosen as to scare the legendary fierce and barbarous beast \u201cNian\u201d, which ate up villagers\u2019 crops, livestock and even villagers themselves on the eve of the new year. ==Forms of fai chun== In the past, fai chun was presented in Xuan paper, also named rice-paper. Its fine and soft texture enables vivid and dynamic artistic expression of Chinese calligraphy. In this age of technology, city dwellers seldom write their own fai chun. Instead, they purchase them in the stationery stores or shopping malls where a wide diversity of styles is offered. Thanks to the advancement in technology, fai chun can be printed in multiple colors. Commercialization of fai chun can be seen when animated characters are used to attract children while sparkling decoration are used to attract adults. Moreover, the material of fai chun is no more limited to mere paper. Fai chun made by cloth, plastic and layers of cardboards are quite common. Nevertheless, the practice of writing fai chun continues in traditional areas, particularly in walled villages. ==Types of fai chun== The types of fai chun are as follows: ===Doufang=== Doufang (\u6597\u65b9) is a square that its angles point to four cardinal points. Owing to the limited space, this type of fai chun only displays one character such as \u201cChun\u201d (\u6625; Spring), \u201cMan\u201d (\u6eff; Full) and \u201cFu\u201d (\u798f; Good fortune). \u201cMan\u201d is stuck on rice bins of refrigerators hoping for abundant food. \u201cFu\u201d is always hung inverted on the center of the door on purpose. The reason behind this is the superstition that the homonymy of the Mandarin words \u201cinverted\u201d (\u5012) and \u201carrival\u201d (\u5230) suggests the arrival of happiness and good fortune. Combined words, a non-existent word that encompasses parts of Chinese characters, is also very common. ===Chuntiao=== Chuntiao (\u6625\u689d) is a vertical or horizontal rectangle that carries two or four Chinese characters. Auspicious phases are expressed based on various contexts. For example, \u201cG\u014dngx\u01d0 f\u0101c\u00e1i\u201d \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1 is an ubiquitous phrase that wishes people to become affluent so it can be seen in all occasions. Regarding workplace, \u201cC\u00e1iyu\u00e1n g\u01d4ng\u01d4n\u201d (\u8ca1\u6e90\u6efe\u6efe; Merchandise will turn like a wheel) is a term that suggest prosperity. At home, \u201cni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2uy\u00fa\u201d (\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918; Surplus year-after-year) are deemed to wish for excess family possessions in the end of the year. Children usually paste \u201cXu\u00e9y\u00e8 j\u00ecnb\u00f9\u201d (\u5b78\u696d\u9032\u6b65; Progress in studies) on their bedroom doors hoping for higher form position in the coming academic year while the elderly hang \u201cL\u00f3ng m\u01ce j\u012bngsh\u00e9n\u201d (\u9f8d\u99ac\u7cbe\u795e; Spirits of dragon and horse), which is conceived to be able to shelter them from diseases. ===Chunlian (Spring couplets)=== Chunlian (\u6625\u806f) is a couplet, typically seven characters, on two sides of the door frame, whose content is related to spring. Lexical and tonal rules are always adhered, though not strictly, as chunlian is transformed from metrical poems. Sometimes, concurrently, a horizontal scroll with four to five characters is hanged on the crosspiece of the door. Its content is mostly about the beauty of nature, patriotism of China and their earnestness of a splendid future. Besides being hung on door frames, chunlian are necessary items that are unfurled at the end of a dragon dance. ==References== Category:Chinese New Year Category:Chinese calligraphy ",
