    "text": "Pennsylvania Route 940 (PA 940) is a Pennsylvania highway located in the sparsely developed Pocono Mountains. It runs from PA 309 in Hazleton to PA 191 in Paradise Valley. Large segments of PA 940 are located in densely forested areas. The route heads northeast through Luzerne County from Hazleton, passing through Freeland and coming to an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) in White Haven. From here, PA 940 turns east and runs a short distance north of I-80, coming to an interchange with both I-80 and I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) in northern Carbon County. The route continues through Monroe County and passes through Pocono Pines before it has an interchange with I-380 and becomes a short freeway. After the freeway ends, PA 940 passes through Mount Pocono prior to continuing to its eastern terminus. PA 940 was first designated in 1928 between White Haven and PA 115 in Blakeslee. The road between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit was part of PA 115 while PA 615 was designated between PA 115 in Pocono Summit and PA 90 (now PA 390) west of Paradise Valley. PA 940 was extended east to U.S. Route 611 (US 611) in Swiftwater in 1935, replacing a portion of PA 115. PA 615 was decommissioned in 1946. PA 940 was extended west to US 309 in Hazleton by 1950. PA 196 was designated onto the roadway between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley in 1956. PA 940 was moved to its current alignment between Pocono Summit and Paradise Valley in 1964 after the roadway in Pocono Summit was upgraded to a short freeway; the route replaced PA 196 between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley while PA 314 was designated along the former PA 940 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater. ==Route description== ===Luzerne County=== PA 940 begins at an intersection with PA 309 and 22nd Street at the northern border of the city of Hazleton in Luzerne County, heading northeast as a two-lane undivided road into Hazle Township.

The highway was designated as part of PA 15 from Blakeslee to Pocono Summit in 1927. In 1928, PA 940 was designated along an unpaved road between White Haven and PA 115 in Blakeslee. PA 115 replaced the PA 15 designation between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit and the road between PA 115 in Pocono Summit and PA 90 (now PA 390) west of Paradise Valley was designated as PA 615. At this time, PA 115 between Blakeslee and Pocono Summit and all of PA 615 was paved. By 1930, the unnumbered road between Hazleton and White Haven was paved. In April 1935, the eastern terminus of PA 940 was extended from Blakeslee to US 611 in Swiftwater, replacing this section of PA 115. By 1940, the road was paved between White Haven and Blakeslee. In 1946, PA 615 was decommissioned and the segment went unnumbered. By 1950, PA 940 was extended west from White Haven to US 309 in Hazleton. In 1956, the segment from Mount Pocono to Paradise Valley was designated as an extension of PA 196. PA 940 near Pocono Summit was upgraded to a freeway in 1964; as a result the PA 196 designation between Mount Pocono and Paradise Valley was removed and PA 940 was rerouted and extended to an intersection with PA 191 in Paradise Valley. The former alignment of PA 940 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater became the western portion of PA 314. ==Major intersections== ==PA 940 Truck== See also: Pennsylvania Route 423 Truck Pennsylvania Route 940 Truck (PA 940 Truck) was a truck route of PA 940 that bypassed a weight-restricted bridge over the Tobyhanna Creek at Pocono Lake in Tobyhanna Township, on which trucks over 30 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route followed PA 115, I-80, and I-380. It was signed in 2013, but it was decommissioned in 2016 following a bridge repair. ==See also== * * ==References== 940 Category:Transportation in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Carbon County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Pocono Mountains Category:Limited- access roads in Pennsylvania ",
