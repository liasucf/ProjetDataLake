    "text": "State Route 268 (SR 268) is a southwest\u2013northeast state highway located in the south-central part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It travels within portions of Coffee and Jeff Davis counties. ==Route description== There is no section of SR 268 that is included as a part of the National Highway System. SR 268 begins at an intersection with SR 32 southeast of Ambrose. The route heads north-northeast and curves to the northeast to enter Ambrose. There, it crosses a Seaboard Coast Line railroad. It heads northeast, crosses the Seventeen Mile River, and intersects SR 206 (Bowens Mill Road). Farther to the northeast is Broxton, where it has a brief concurrency with US 441/SR 31 along Alabama Street. Northeast of Broxton, the route enters Jeff Davis County, and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 107 in Snipesville. ==History== SR 268 was established in 1950, with the part from SR 32 to Ambrose being paved. In 1957, a section from Broxton just to the northeast was paved. By 1960, the road was paved from its western terminus to just northeast of the Coffee-Jeff Davis County line. Also, the road was extended to Hazlehurst. By 1988, the road's eastern terminus was truncated to Snipesville, where it is today. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * 268 Category:Transportation in Coffee County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Jeff Davis County, Georgia ",
