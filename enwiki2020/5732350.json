The institute was inaugurated on 27 December 1974, establishing it as an autonomous body under the Societies Registration Act to lead in the area of medical service and research in the country. On 14 November 1994, NIMHANS was conferred a deemed university status by the University Grants Commission with academic autonomy. The institute has been declared as an Institute of National Importance by an act of parliament in 2012. In March 2017, the Government of India passed the Mental Healthcare Bill 2016, which also proposes to set up NIMHANS-like institutions across the nation. ==Rankings and Reputation== The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences has been ranked 4th best medical institution in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework medical ranking for 2020. ==Organization and Administration== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#ffc; color:black; width:20.5em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Directors of the AIIMH/NIMHANS |- | style=\"text-align: left;\" | * Dr. M V Govindaswamy (1954\u201359) * Dr. D L N Murti Rao (1960\u201362) * Dr. B D Punekar (1963) * Dr. Keki Masani (1963\u201364) * Dr. N C Surya (1965\u201368) * Dr. K Bhaskaran (1969) * Dr. R Martanda Varma (1969\u201377) * Dr. K S Mani (1977\u201378) * Dr. R Martanda Varma (1978\u201379) * Dr. G N Narayana Reddy (1979\u201389) * Dr. S M Channabasavanna (1989\u201397) * Dr. M Gourie-Devi (1997\u20132002) * Dr. D Nagaraja (2002\u201310) * Dr. SK Shankar (2010) * Dr. P Satish Chandra (2010\u201315) * Dr. B.N.

Preeti Jacob, from the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, was quoted as saying \"Juveniles are less culpable and are much more amenable to rehabilitative efforts and thus should not be transferred to the adult criminal justice system. The assessments that are being proposed in the bill in order to ascertain the mental capacity to commit an offense are arbitrary and unscientific.\" * Detention and evaluation of whistleblower: In December 2014, it was reported that a soldier from the Indian Navy was being held in NIMHANS for a month to evaluate whether he was suffering from mental illness, after acting as a whistleblower. After the month-long evaluation, NIMHANS concluded that the Navy person was not suffering from any mental illness. * Involvement with aiding investigative agency with interrogation techniques: In July 2013, NIMHANS came under controversy when it was revealed by Times of India that it was collaborating with the Central Bureau of Investigation to train its staff with interrogation techniques. * Involvement with suppression of Koodankulam anti-nuclear protests: It was reported by prominent news sources that the central government approached NIMHANS to suppress anti-nuclear protests in regard to building of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The government asked NIMHANS to dispatch psychiatrists to Kudankulam to counsel protesters. To fulfil the plan, NIMHANS developed a team of six members, all of them from the Department of Social Psychiatry. The psychiatrists were sent to get a \"peek a into the protesters' minds\" and help them learn the importance of the plant according to one news source.Koodankulam counselling for protestors flayed.

It was alleged by the media that the television show judges' behaviour caused such disability. To resolve her case, she was flown from Kolkata to Bangalore's NIMHANS to be treated for a neurobiological condition.Hope floats as docs work to get Shinjini back on feet \u2013 Times Of India.

The then medical superintendent told the press: * Criticism of WHO report: In August 2011, NIMHANS faculty criticized a report published by the World Health Organization. The head of the psychiatry department, S K Chaturvedi, said that the figures by the WHO were highly inflated. Where, in the report, it alleges that 36% of Indians suffer from depression, the highest among all the countries, the NIMHANS faculty state that the incidence of depression is much lower due to a stronger social support system and family structure. However, the lifetime prevalence of depression in India measured by the study was only 9%, and the figure of 36% was a different metric that was mistakenly reported as the prevalence rate by some media houses. ==Controversies== In February 2014, NIMHANS approached the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce to complain about a film to be released with the same name. Although initially, the institution was able to block the release of the film if it was named as such, subsequently, the film-maker was able to launch his film without renaming it, once the Censor Board and KFCC approved the name in its second round. ==Notable People== NIMHANS has a strong alumni network of medical scientists and doctors taking over many prestigious positions across the world. Some of the prominent people associated with institute include clinical psychologists H. Narayan Murthy, Radhika Chandiramani and Satwant Pasricha, philosophers and yoga therapists S. K. Ramachandra Rao H. R. Nagendra, psychiatrists M.
