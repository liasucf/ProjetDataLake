Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions.The Verbally Abusive Relationship, Patricia Evans. Adams Media Corp 1992, 1996, 2010 Verbal abuse is a maladaptive mechanism that anyone can display occasionally, such as during times of high stress or physical discomfort. For some people, it is a pattern of behaviors used intentionally to control or manipulate others or to get revenge. ==Types== In schools and in everyday life, a person may engage in verbal abuse\u2014bullying (which often has a physical component)\u2014to gain status as superior to the person targeted and to bond with others against the target.

This is also known as gas- lighting or Jekyll and Hyde-like behavior, because the abuser keeps the target of abuse off-balance with their hot-and-cold unpredictable behavior. This confusion adds to the pain caused by psychological abuse and keeps the victim off-balance.Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them, Susan Foreword, Bantam, 2002 Anyone can experience verbal abuse. Typically, in romantic or family relationships, verbal abuse increases in intensity and frequency over time. After exposure to verbal abuse, victims may develop clinical depression. The person targeted by verbal abuse over time may succumb to any stress- related illness. Verbal abuse creates emotional pain and mental anguish in its target.
