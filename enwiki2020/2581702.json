It is found six miles south of Alcester, about the same distance from Evesham, very close to the Worcestershire border, and is within the parish of Salford Priors. The River Avon runs close by the eastern side of the village. ==Salford Hall== Building work on Salford Hall, the village's largest and grandest building, commenced in 1470 as a living place for monks from nearby Evesham Abbey.Salford Hall Hotel Website By the reign of Charles 1st it had become, by marriage, a seat of the Roman Catholic Stanford of Perry Hall, Staffordshire, family. Charles Stanford, a grandson of Sir William Stanford, Knt., (d.1558), Justice of the Common Pleas, completed the building of Salford Hall, and commemorated the event by hanging up a bell on the top of the house bearing the inscription \"Charles Stanford, Esqre., Ellinor, 1610\" (for Eleanor Alderford, his wife). His son, John Stanford of Salford Hall, was a Cavalier and was killed in 1649.The Catholic Record Society's Miscellanea, vol.13. The Great Hall has a four-centred fireplace in the south wall, and in the east wall a doorway with a 17th-century pediment and shield with the Arms of the Stanfords, who resided there until 1812.'Parishes: Salford Priors', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 155-165.
