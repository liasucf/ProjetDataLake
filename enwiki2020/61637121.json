However, on the second reading of the bill, the proposed amendments were rejected by 356\u2013256 in the National Assembly following a campaign by the territory's MP Maurice Lenormand, who demanded a common electoral roll. The bill was referred to a committee, but due to a government crisis, dealing with the issue was repeatedly postponed. The term of the sitting Council had expired on 19 January 1952, leaving no elected replacement.Strain in New Caledonia: Bitter Fight Over Votes for Natives Pacific Islands Monthly, June 1952, p15 The Chairman of the outgoing General Council Henri Bonneaud flew to France to request its term be extended, which was approved by a vote of 325\u2013198 in the National Assembly. However, when it emerged that around 100 of the votes in favour had come from Communist Party MPs, all-but-one of the members of the General Council refused to continue sitting and handed in their resignation to the Governor on 19 May. ==Electoral system== A decree in 1952 created a single electoral roll and divided the territory into five constituencies. Seats were elected by panachage and preferential voting.Jean Le Borgne (2005) Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie: 1945-1968 - La confiance trahie, p43 By the time of the election, the voter roll consisted of 10,511 Europeans and 9,832 Kanaks. ==Results== Fifteen of the 25 seats were won by left-wing candidates led by Lenormand (including nine Kanaks) that became the Caledonian Union, eight by right-wing candidates from a bloc led by Bonneaud, and two by other candidates. Three pro Charles de Gaulle candidates were all defeated. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Constituency !Elected members !Faction |- |rowspan=4|East District and \u00cele-des-Pins||Mathieu Aripoindi||Lenormand group |- |Kowi Bouillant||Lenormand group |- |Doui Matayo Wetta||Lenormand group |- |Rock Pidjot||Lenormand group |- |rowspan=2|East Coast||E.
