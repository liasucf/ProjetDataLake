The first of these is the general classification, calculated by adding up the time each rider took to ride each stage. Time bonuses are applied for winning stages (10, 6 and 4 seconds to the first three riders) and for the three \"golden kilometre\" sprints on each stage. At each of these sprints, the first three riders are given 3-, 2- and 1-second bonuses respectively. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the winner of the general classification. The rider leading the classification wins a green jersey. There is also a points classification. On each road stage the riders are awarded points for finishing in the top 10 places, with other points awarded for intermediate sprints. The rider with the most accumulated points is the leader of the classification and wins the blue jersey. The combativity classification is based solely on points won at the intermediate sprints; the leading rider wins the black jersey. The final classification is a team classification: on each stage the times of the best three riders on each team are added up. The team with the lowest cumulative time over the seven stages wins the team classification. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage ! style=\"width:13%;\"| Winner ! style=\"width:14%;\"| General classification ! style=\"width:14%;\"| Points classification ! style=\"width:14%;\"| Combativity classification ! style=\"width:14%;\"| Team classification |- | 1 | Peter Sagan | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| Peter Sagan | style=\"background:lightblue;\"| Peter Sagan | style=\"background:grey;\" rowspan=7| | |- | 2 | Stefan K\u00fcng | style=\"background:lightgreen;\" rowspan=3| Stefan K\u00fcng | style=\"background:lightblue;\"| Stefan K\u00fcng | rowspan=3| |- | 3 | Peter Sagan | style=\"background:lightblue;\" rowspan=5| Peter Sagan |- | 4 | Edward Theuns |- | 5 | Lars Boom | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| Lars Boom | |- | 6 | Tim Wellens | style=\"background:lightgreen;\" rowspan=2| Tom Dumoulin | |- | 7 | Jasper Stuyven | |- ! colspan=2| Final ! style=\"background:green;\"| ! style=\"background:blue;\"| ! style=\"background:grey;\"| ! style=\"background:offwhite;\"| |} ==References== == External links == * Category:BinckBank Tour BinckBank Tour BinckBank Tour BinckBank Tour BinckBank Tour ",
