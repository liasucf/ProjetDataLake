    "text": "Francis Asbury Tarkenton (born February 3, 1940) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons, primarily with the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football for the University of Georgia, where he was recognized as a two-time first-team All- SEC, and was selected by the Vikings in the third round of the 1961 NFL Draft. After retiring from football, he became a television personality and computer software executive. Tarkenton's tenure with the Vikings spanned 13 non- consecutive seasons, playing with the team for six seasons from 1961 to 1966, then for seven seasons from 1972 to 1978. In between his years in Minnesota, Tarkenton was a member of the New York Giants for five seasons. At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton owned every major quarterback record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987. In addition to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on Monday Night Football and a co-host of That's Incredible!. He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE (computer-aided software engineering) with Albert F. Case Jr. of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with KnowledgeWare (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994. ==Early life and education== Fran Tarkenton was born on February 3, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. His father, Dallas Tarkenton, was a Methodist minister. Tarkenton went to Athens High School in Athens, Georgia, and later attended the University of Georgia, where he was the quarterback on the Bulldog football team and a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Under Coach Wally Butts and with Tarkenton as quarterback, Georgia won the 1959 Southeastern Conference championship. Tarkenton was a first-team All-SEC selection in both 1959 and 1960. ==Professional football career== The Minnesota Vikings drafted Tarkenton in the third round of the 1961 NFL Draft, and he was picked in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL draft by the Boston Patriots. He signed with the Vikings. Tarkenton, 21, played his first NFL game (and the Vikings' first game) on September 17 against the Chicago Bears, coming off the bench to lead the Vikings to a come-from-behind victory by passing for 250 yards and four touchdown passes and running for another as the Vikings defeated the Bears 37-13\\. He was the only player in NFL history to pass for four touchdowns in his first NFL game, until the feat was repeated by Marcus Mariota in the Tennessee Titans' 2015 season opener versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\"A Look at Marcus Mariota's Rookie Accomplishments\" by Jim Wyatt, Titans online, December 31, 2015 scrambling (1974) He played for the Vikings from 1961 to 1966. His early years with the team were plagued by the trouble expected for a newly created team, with the Vikings winning a total of 10 games combined in their first three seasons, with Tarkenton winning eight of them. He threw 18 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 1,997 yards in his first season. He rushed for 308 yards on 56 rushes for five touchdowns. The following year, he threw 22 touchdowns and 25 interceptions for 2,595 yards. He rushed for 361 yards on 41 rushes for two touchdowns.

After trailing 23\u201310 in the fourth quarter, Tarkenton threw two touchdown passes to secure a 24\u201323 comeback victory over his former team.\"Minnesota Vikings at New York Giants - September 21st, 1969\", Pro-Football-Reference.com The 24 points allowed by Minnesota's defense were a season-worst for the unit, one more point than the Vikings allowed in losing Super Bowl IV to the Kansas City Chiefs.\"1969 Minnesota Vikings\", Pro-Football-Reference.com Tarkenton enjoyed his best season with the Giants in 1970. The club overcame an 0\u20133 start to win nine of the next 10 games and move into position to win the NFC East division championship in week 14. However, New York was routed 31\u20133 by the Los Angeles Rams at Yankee Stadium, leaving the Giants 9\u20135, one game behind the division champion Dallas Cowboys and the wild card Detroit Lions. The 1970 season was the closest the Giants came to making the playoffs during a 17-year drought, spanning the 1964 through 1980 seasons. Tarkenton was traded back to Minnesota in 1972, for three players (Norm Snead, Bob Grim and Vince Clements), plus a first and second round draft choice. He led the Vikings to three National Football Conference championships, but in each instance the Vikings lost the ensuing Super Bowl. In Tarkenton's first Super Bowl appearance his team lost to the Miami Dolphins 24-7 in Houston. They lost the second to the Pittsburgh Steelers 16\u20136 in New Orleans, and in the last Super Bowl Tarkenton played (and Minnesota's last Super Bowl to date), the Vikings lost to the Oakland Raiders 32\u201314 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

He ranks fifth in career rushing yards among quarterbacks, behind Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Michael Vick and Cam Newton.
