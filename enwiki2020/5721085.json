    "text": "\"Ave Regina caelorum\" is one of the Marian antiphons said or sung in the Liturgy of the Hours at the close of compline. In the Roman Breviary as revised by Pope Pius V in 1569 it was assigned for this use from compline of 2 February until compline of Wednesday of Holy Week. Since the revision of the Liturgy of the Hours in 1969, the only Marian antiphon for whose use a fixed period is laid down is the Easter season antiphon Regina caeli.\"Finally one of the antiphons of the Blessed Virgin Mary is said. In Eastertide this is always the Regina caeli\" (General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours, 92).Hugh Henry, \"Ave Regina\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907)Ruth Steiner, \"Ave Regina caelorum\" in New Catholic EncyclopediaGregory DiPippo, \"Ave Regina Caelorum\" Like the other Marian antiphons, Ave Regina caelorum has been set to polyphonic music by composers such as Leonel Power (d. 1445), Guillaume Du Fay (d. 1474), Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria (1548-1611), Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 3 settings, H 22, H 19, H 45 and Joseph Haydn (1732-1809).M.
