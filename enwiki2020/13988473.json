Some of them also settled in the frontier city of Rivera. The 2011 Uruguayan census revealed 103 people who declared Greece as their country of birth. The Greek community center and the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Nikolaos are located on 19 de Abril Avenue in Prado. Another important Greek institution in Montevideo is the Maria Tsakos Foundation which offers free lessons of the Greek language, of Greek dances and cooking and organizes cultural activities. The Great Uruguayan footballer, Obdulio Varela was of part-Greek descent and is to date the only footballer with any Greek blood in them to win the FIFA World Cup. Included are Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, who became adjusted to Argentine society because of the linguistic similarities between Romanian and Spanish, as well as the Latin identity of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians. There was also a very small number of Greek Jews. ==Notable people== * Fernando Kanapkis, footballer * Obdulio Varela, footballer * Jos\u00e9 Cholevas, footballer * Graciela Paraskevaidis, musicologist * Circe Maia, poet ==See also== * Greek people * Greek diaspora * Greek-Uruguayan relations ==References== ==External links== * Bilateral relations between Greece and Uruguay * A Greek association * Greek embassy in Uruguay * Hellenic Community in Uruguay Uruguay Category:European Uruguayan Category:Immigration to Uruguay Category:Greek immigration to Uruguay Category:Ethnic groups in Uruguay ",
