She became a member of the Brigettine order of the Vadstena Abbey in 1489. She was the author of the Codex Holm. A 3, a list documenting the rules of the abbey, from 1502. In 1518, she was elected abbess by a majority of votes from the monks but a minority of votes from the nuns of the double convent, but the bishop granted her the election victory and had her installed as abbess. She hosted king Christian II of Denmark in 1521. In circa 1526, the famous scandal about Liten Agda och Olof Tyste was to have taken place at the abbey, and the following year, when the Swedish Reformation was introduced, king Gustav I of Sweden gave instructions to the abbess through Bishop Hans Brask, with reference to the scandalous elopement of the nun Agda, who had been placed in the abbey against her will, with her lover Olof, that no-one should be allowed to become a nun at the abbey in the future without permission from the monarch.Historiskt bibliotek utgifvet af Carl Silfverstolpe The existing members were also given royal permission to leave the convent if the wished to do so: some of the younger nuns made use of this permit, and the abbess Anna Germundsdotter was forbidden to stop them.Historiskt bibliotek utgifvet af Carl Silfverstolpe In 1529, two monks and their confessor attended the \u00d6rebro Synod, and was noted to have changed their sympathies to the Protestant reformers.
