Bob Jamerson, known as Baton Bob, is a well known local character and costumed street performer, currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. Baton Bob used to live in St. Louis, Missouri and in both cities is a significant local personality. He typically marches down urban sidewalks dressed in a tutu and occasionally a tiara. As his name suggests, he almost always twirls a baton as well. His stated goal is to amuse and cheer passersby, to \"lift people\u2019s spirits and put a simple smile on people\u2019s faces during their daily routine\".Jim Farmer, (April 28, 2006). \u2018Shake\u2019 it: Beloved street performer Baton Bob to join cast of outdoor Shakespeare event Southern Voice He occasionally calls himself the \"Ambassador of Mirth\". ==Origin== Jamerson grew up an only child on a farm in Martinsville, Virginia. As a boy, he became enthralled with band majorettes at college football games. When he went to high school, he asked to be his school's first male baton twirler. Wearing a cheerleader's sweater and white pants with gold stripes, he often was tempted to outperform the majorettes. Jamerson eventually moved to St. Louis and worked as a flight attendant, but was laid off after the 9/11 attacks (he now works as a floral designer). To counter his depression, a psychologist recommended he do things that brought him joy and so Jamerson began twirling his baton in public again.Sylvester Brown Jr. (August 8, 2004). \"Shabby treatment here has quashed Baton Bob's mirth\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) He expanded his wardrobe of transgressive costumes and marched through city streets several afternoons every week. Although some have gossiped that he is \"crazy\",CNN \"Live From\" transcript, accessed June 28, 2006. there is no serious indication that this is true. Baton Bob's motive to entertain is often tied to the current state of the world. Though he created his character to raise peoples' spirits after the 9/11 attacks, other events have caused him to continue. When interviewed by CNN, he made reference to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. ==Events precipitating his departure from St. Louis== Press reports indicate the public in Atlanta highly appreciates Baton Bob. Though he was appreciated by some, he annoyed others in St. Louis and Atlanta as well. Several exceptional events precipitated his departure. * During the summer of 2003, an observer mooned the character. Both men mutually escalated the situation until the unidentified observer struck Baton Bob in the cheek, an injury that required five stitches. The observer was later arrested by St. Louis detectives and prosecuted.Deb Peterson (column). (June 12, 2003) \"Baton Bob is beaten after doing twirling routine\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) * The following summer, when he marched with Missouri NARAL in a suburban 4th of July parade, police manhandled him in an attempt to remove him from the procession. Though the police allowed Baton Bob to remain in the parade, the incident prompted a complaint that alleged the police also swore and called him names.Heather Ratcliffe. (July 9, 2004) \"Police are accused of manhandling Baton Bob\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) * Later the same summer, Baton Bob was arrested while participating in a Kerry/Edwards rally at St. Louis Union Station.

Several police officers asked him to leave, and he refused, allegedly kicking one of the officers. According to Baton Bob, an officer then logged on to Baton Bob's Facebook account and posted a pro-police message reading, in part, \"I want to verify, that the Atlanta police was respectful to me considering the circumstances\". The charges were later dismissed, and the officer who posted the message resigned; his lieutenant was disciplined for \"violating the responsibilities of a supervisor\". Baton Bob filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city. Although the city released a statement calling Baton Bob's claims \"baseless\", they offered a $20,000 settlement. On June 26, 2015, two years to the day after the arrest, Baton Bob married local chef Gary Bender in a ceremony that had been long planned for that day. Their wedding happened to fall on the same date that the Supreme Court announced its decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from Martinsville, Virginia Category:People from St. Louis Category:Artists from Atlanta Category:LGBT African Americans ",
