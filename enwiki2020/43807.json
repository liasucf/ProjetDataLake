    "text": "Lombardy ( ; ; , , ) is one of the twenty administrative regions of Italy, in the northwest of the country, with an area of . About 10 million people live in Lombardy, forming more than one-sixth of Italy's population, and more than a fifth of Italy's GDP is produced in the region, making it the most populous, richest and most productive region in the country. It is also one of the top regions in Europe for the same criteria.OECD Data Synthesis. Milan's metropolitan area is the largest in Italy and the third most populated functional urban area in the EU.Eurostat \u2013 Functional urban areas . Lombardy is also the Italian region with most UNESCO World Heritage Sites\u2014Italy (tied with China) having the highest number of World Heritage Sites in the world.List of World Heritage Sites by country. The region is also famous for its historical figures such as Virgil, Pliny the Elder, Ambrose, Caravaggio, Claudio Monteverdi, Antonio Stradivari, Cesare Beccaria, Alessandro Volta, Alessandro Manzoni, and popes John XXIII and Paul VI. ==Etymology== The word Lombardy comes from Lombard, which in turn is derived from Late Latin ' (\"a Lombard\"), derived from the Proto-Germanic elements *langaz + *bardaz; equivalent to long beard. Some scholars suggest the second element instead derives from Proto-Germanic *bard\u01ed, *barduz (\"axe\"), related to German ' (\"axe\") or that the whole word comes from the Proto-Albanian *Lum bardhi \"white river\" (Compare modern Albanian lum i bardh\u00eb). During the early Middle Ages, \"Lombardy\" referred to the Kingdom of the Lombards (), a kingdom ruled by the Germanic Lombards who had controlled most of Italy since their invasion of Byzantine Italy in 568. As such \"Lombardy\" and \"Italy\" were almost interchangeable; by the mid-8th century the Lombards ruled everywhere except the Papal possessions around Rome (roughly modern Lazio and northern Umbria), Venice and some Byzantine possessions in the south (southern Apulia and Calabria; some coastal settlements including Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples and Sorrento; Sicily and Sardinia). The Kingdom was divided between Longobardia Major in the north and Langobardia Minor in the south by the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna (roughly Romagna and northern Marche, and initially also Emilia and Liguria) until the 8th century and later the Papacy (which was initially part of the Exarchate). During the late Middle Ages, after the fall of the northern part of the Kingdom to Charlemagne, the term shifted to mean Northern Italy. (See: Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)). The term was also used until around 965 in the form (') as the name for the territory roughly covering modern Apulia which the Byzantines had recovered from the Lombard rump Duchy of Benevento. ==Geography== With a surface of , Lombardy is the fourth-largest region of Italy. It is bordered by Switzerland (north: Canton Ticino and Canton Graub\u00fcnden) and by the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol and Veneto (east), Emilia-Romagna (south), and Piedmont (west). Three distinct natural zones can be easily distinguished in Lombardy: mountains, hills, and plains\u2014the last being divided into Alta (high plains) and Bassa (low plains). ===Soils=== Pizzo Coca is the highest peak in the Bergamasque Alps (3,050 m) The orography of Lombardy is characterised by the presence of three distinct belts: a northern mountainous belt constituted by the Alpine relief, a central piedmont area of mostly pebbly soils of alluvial origin, and the Lombard section of the Padan Plain in the southernmost part of the region. The most important mountainous area is the Alpine zone including the Lepontine and Rhaetian Alps (Piz Bernina, 4,020 m), the Bergamo Alps, the Ortler Alps and the Adamello massif. It is followed by the Alpine foothills zone Prealpi, the main peaks of which are the Grigna Group (2,410 m), Resegone (1,875 m), and Presolana (2,521 m). The plains of Lombardy, formed by alluvial deposits, can be divided into the Alta\u2014an upper, permeable ground zone in the north\u2014and the Bassa\u2014a lower zone dotted by the so-called line of fontanili, spring waters rising from impermeable ground. Inconsistent with the three distinctions above is the small subregion of Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese, formed by the Apennine foothills beyond the Po River. ===Hydrography=== Po river, Italy's longest, limits the southern border of the region The mighty Po river marks the southern border of the region for a length of about . In its progress, it receives the waters of the Ticino River, which rises in the Bedretto valley (Switzerland) and joins the Po near Pavia. The other streams which contribute to the great river are the Olona, the Lambro, the Adda, the Oglio and the Mincio. The numerous lakes of Lombardy, all of glacial origin, lie in the northern highlands. From west to east these are Lake Maggiore, Lake Lugano (both shared with Switzerland), Lake Como, Lake Iseo, Lake Idro, and Lake Garda (the largest lake in Italy). South of the Alps lie the hills characterised by a succession of low heights of morainic origin formed during the last Ice Age and small barely fertile plateaux with typical heaths and conifer woods. A minor mountainous area, the Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese, lies south of the Po, in the Apennines range. ===Flora and fauna=== The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) In the plains, intensively cultivated for centuries, little of the original environment remains. The most common trees are elm, alder, sycamore, poplar, willow and hornbeam. In the area of the foothills lakes, however, grow olive trees, cypresses and larches, as well as varieties of subtropical flora such as magnolias, azaleas, acacias. Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some kinds of saxifrage, the Lombard garlic, groundsels bellflowers and the cottony bellflowers. The highlands are characterised by the typical vegetation of the whole range of the Italian Alps. At lower levels (up to approximately 1,100 m), oak woods or broadleafed trees grow; on the mountain slopes (up to 2,000\u20132,200 m), beech trees grow at the lowest limits, with conifer woods higher up. Shrubs such as rhododendron, dwarf pine and juniper are native to the summital zone (beyond 2,200 m). Lombardy counts many protected areas: the most important are the Stelvio National Park (the largest Italian natural park), with typically alpine wildlife: red deer, roe deer, ibex, chamois, foxes, ermine and also golden eagles; and the Ticino Valley Natural Park, instituted in 1974 on the Lombard side of the Ticino River to protect and conserve one of the last major examples of fluvial forest in northern Italy. ===Climate=== Lombardy has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to inland water basins, and large metropolitan areas. Olive trees on the Lake Garda The climate of the region is mainly humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) especially in the plains, though with significant variations to the K\u00f6ppen model especially regarding the winter season, which in Lombardy is normally long, damp, and rather cold. In addition, there is a high seasonal temperature variation (in Milan, the average January temperature is and in July). A peculiarity of the regional climate is the thick fog that covers the plains between October and February. In the Alpine foothills, characterised by an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfb), numerous lakes exercise a mitigating influence, allowing the cultivation of typically Mediterranean crops (olives, citrus fruit). In the hills and mountains, the climate is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). In the valleys it is relatively mild, while it can be severely cold above 1,500 m, with copious snowfalls. Precipitation is more intense in the Prealpine zone, up to annually, but is abundant also in the plains and alpine zones, with an average of annually. The total annual rainfall is on average 827 mm. ==History== ===Prehistory and antiquity=== The Rock Drawings in Valcamonica are among the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world. It is thought from the archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones that the area of current Lombardy has been settled at least since the 2nd millennium BC. Well-preserved rock drawings left by ancient Camuni in the Valcamonica depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over a time period of eight thousand years preceding the Iron Age,Piero Adorno, Mesolitico e Neolitico, p. 16. based on about 300,000 records. The many artifacts (pottery, personal items and weapons) found in necropolis near the Lake Maggiore, and Lake Ticino demonstrate the presence of the Golasecca Bronze Age culture that prospered in Western Lombardy between the 9th and the 4th century BC. In the following centuries it was inhabited by different peoples, among whom were the Etruscans, who founded the city of Mantua and spread the use of writing. Later, starting from the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by the Celtic Gallic tribes. These people settled in several cities including Milan, and extended their rule to the Adriatic Sea. Their development was halted by the Roman expansion in the Po Valley from the 3rd century BC onwards. After centuries of struggle, in 194 BC the entire area of what is now Lombardy became a Roman province with the name of Gallia Cisalpina (\"Gaul on the inner side (with respect to Rome) of the Alps\"). The Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilisation in the following years, and Lombardy became one of the most developed and richest areas of Italy with the construction of a wide array of roads and the development of agriculture and trade. Important figures were born here, like Pliny the Elder (in Como) and Virgil (in Mantua). In late antiquity the strategic role of Lombardy was emphasised by the temporary moving of the capital of the Western Empire to Mediolanum (Milan). Here, in 313 AD, Roman Emperor Constantine issued the famous Edict of Milan that gave freedom of confession to all religions within the Roman Empire. ===Kingdom of the Lombards=== For centuries, the Iron Crown of Lombardy was used in the Coronation of the King of Italy. During and after the fall of the Western Empire, Lombardy suffered heavily from destruction brought about by a series of invasions by tribal peoples. The last and most effective was that of the Germanic Lombards, or Longobardi, whose whole nation migrated here from the Carpathian basin in fear of the conquering Pannonian Avars in 568 and whose long-lasting reign (with its capital in Pavia) gave the current name to the region. There was a close relationship between the Frankish, Bavarian and Lombard nobility for many centuries. After the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the Latin-speaking people improved. In the end, the Lombard language and culture assimilated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws, and other things. The genes of the Lombards became quickly diluted into the Italian population owing to their relatively small number and their geographic dispersal to rule and administer their kingdom. The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered Pavia, deposed Desiderius, the last Lombard king, and annexed the Kingdom of Italy (mostly northern and central present-day Italy) to his newly established Holy Roman Empire. The former Lombard dukes and nobles were replaced by other German vassals, prince-bishops or marquises. ===Communes and the Empire=== Battle of Cortenuova, 1237. In the 10th century, Lombardy, although formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire like much of central and northern Italy, was in fact divided in a multiplicity of small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes. The 11th century marked a significant boom in the region's economy, due to improved trading and, most importantly, agricultural conditions, with arms manufacture a significant factor. In a similar way to other areas of Italy, this led to a growing self-acknowledgement of the cities, whose increasing richness made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local legates. This process reached its apex in the 12th and 13th centuries, when different Lombard Leagues formed by allied cities of Lombardy, usually led by Milan, managed to defeat the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I, at Legnano, and his grandson Frederick II, at Parma. Subsequently, among the various local city- states, a process of consolidation took place, and by the end of the 14th century, two signorias emerged as rival hegemons in Lombardy: Milan and Mantua. ===Renaissance duchies of Milan and Mantua=== Mantua as it appeared in 1575. In the 15th century, the Duchy of Milan was a major political, economical and military force at the European level. Milan and Mantua became two centres of the Renaissance whose culture, with men such as Leonardo da Vinci and Mantegna, and works of art (e.g. Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper) were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe: \"Lombard\" designated the merchant or banker coming from northern Italy (e.g. Lombard Street in London). The name \"Lombardy\" came to designate the whole of Northern Italy until the 15th century and sometimes later. From the 14th century onwards, the instability created by the unceasing internal and external struggles ended in the creation of noble seigniories, the most significant of which were those of the Viscontis (later Sforzas) in Milan and of the Gonzagas in Mantua. This richness, however, attracted the now more organised armies of national powers such as France and Austria, which waged a lengthy battle for Lombardy in the late 15th to early 16th centuries. ===Late-Middle Ages, Renaissance and Enlightenment=== First Consul on 26 January 1802 After the decisive Battle of Pavia, the Duchy of Milan became a possession of the Habsburgs of Spain: the new rulers did little to improve the economy of Lombardy, instead imposing a growing series of taxes needed to support their unending series of European wars. The eastern part of modern Lombardy, with cities like Bergamo and Brescia, was under the Republic of Venice, which had begun to extend its influence in the area from the 14th century onwards (see also Italian Wars). Between the middle of the 15th century and the battle of Marignano in 1515, the northern part of east Lombardy from Airolo to Chiasso (modern Ticino), and the Valtellina valley came under possession of the old Swiss Confederacy. Pestilences (like that of 1628/1630 described by Alessandro Manzoni in his I Promessi Sposi) and the generally declining conditions of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted the further development of Lombardy. In 1706 the Austrians came to power and introduced some economic and social measures which granted a certain recovery. Austrian rule was interrupted in the late 18th century by the French armies; under Napoleon, Lombardy became the centre of the Cisalpine Republic and of the Kingdom of Italy, both being puppet states of France's First Empire, having Milan as capital and Napoleon as head of state. During this period Lombardy took back Valtellina from Switzerland. ===Modern era=== The Five Days of Milan, 1848. The restoration of Austrian rule in 1815, as the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia, was characterised by the struggle with the new ideals introduced by the Napoleonic era. The popular republic established by the 1848 revolution was short-lived, its suppression leading to renewed Austrian rule. This came to a decisive end when Lombardy was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy 1859 as a result of the Second Italian War of Independence from the Austrian Empire. When annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1859 Lombardy achieved its present-day territorial shape by adding the Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese (formerly the southern part of Novara's Province) to the province of Pavia. ====COVID-19 pandemic==== The Lombardy region was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, in which Italy was one of the worst affected countries in Europe. Several towns were quarantined from 22 February after community transmission was documented in Lombardy and Veneto the previous day. The entire Lombardy region was placed on lockdown on 8 March, followed by all of Italy the following day, making Italy the first country to implement a nationwide lockdown in response to the epidemic, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March. The lockdown was ultimately extended twice, and the Lombardy region toughened restrictions on 22 March, banning outdoor exercise and the use of vending machines, but from the beginning of May, following a decrease in the number of active cases, restrictions gradually began to be relaxed. ==Demographics== {| class=\"infobox\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" |The largest resident foreign-born groups on 31 December 2017 |- !

The population is highly concentrated in the Milan metropolitan area (2,000 inh./km2) and the Alpine foothills that compose the southern section of the provinces of Varese, Como, Lecco, Monza and Brianza and Bergamo, (1,200 inh./km2). A lower average population density (250 inh./km2) is found in the Po valley and the lower Brescia valleys; much lower densities (less than 60 inh./km2) characterise the northern mountain areas and the southern Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese subregion. The growth of the regional population was particularly sustained during the 1950s\u201360s, thanks to a prolonged economic boom, high birth rates, and strong migration inflows (especially from Southern Italy). Since the 1980s, Lombardy has become the destination of a large number of international migrants, insomuch that today, more than a quarter of all foreign-born residents in Italy live in this region. , the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 1,139,430 foreign-born immigrants live in Lombardy, equal to 11.4% of the total population. The primary religion is Catholicism; significant religious minorities include Christian Waldenses, Protestants and Orthodox, as well as Jews, Sikh and Muslims. ==Economy== , the gross domestic product (GDP) of Lombardy, equal to over \u20ac350 billion, accounts for about 21% of the total GDP of Italy. By inhabitant, this figure results in a value of \u20ac33,066, which is more than 25% higher than the national average of \u20ac25,729. {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |+ GDP and GDP per capita in Lombardy (2000\u20132018) |- ! || 2000 || 2001 || 2002 || 2003 || 2004 || 2005 || 2006 || 2007 || 2008 || 2009 || 2010 || 2011 || 2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016 || 2017 !2018 |- | align=left |GDP (Euro) || 247.051,8 || 259.431 || 270.653,3 || 279.450,4 || 289.471,2 || 297.600,4 || 307.717,7 || 320.843,8 || 323.973,3 || 310.952 | 346.797 | 354.342 | 348.665 | 349.008 | 350.025 | 357.200 | 375.270 | 385.133 | 390.461 |- | align=left | GDP per capitaDati Istat consultati il 15 giugno 2016.

At the same time, the strong industrial vocation of the region has not suffered. Lombardy remains, in fact, the main industrial area of the country. The presence, and development, of a very high number of enterprises belonging to the services sector represents a favourable situation for the improvement of the efficiency of the productive process, as well as for the growth of the regional economy. A view over the business district of Milan: with a metropolitan area of 7.4m people, it is Italy's most important industrial, commercial and financial center. Lombardy has cultural and economical relationships with many foreign countries including Azerbaijan, Austria, France, Hungary, Switzerland (especially the cantons of Ticino and Graub\u00fcnden), Canada (the Province of Quebec), Germany (the States of Bavaria, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt), Kuwait, the Netherlands (Province of Zuid- Holland), and Russia. Lombardy is a member of the Four Motors of Europe, an intereuropean economical organization which includes Baden-Wurtenberg in Germany, Catalonia in Spain, and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes in France. The Lombardy region is also part of the EUSALP, which promotes innovation, green sustainability, and economy in the Alpine regions of Austria, France, Liechtenstein, Northern Italy, Southern Germany, Switzerland, and Slovenia, and ARGE ALP, which gathers states located in the alpine regions of Austria, Northern Italy, Southern Germany, and Switzerland to discuss similar themes as in EUSALP. Economical and cultural relationship are also strong with neighboring Italian regions Friuli-Venezia Giulia, South Tyrol, Trentino, and Veneto.https://www.askanews.it/cronaca/2019/05/02/fontana-incontra-fugatti- collaborazione-tra-lombardia-e-trentino-pn_20190502_00154/> The European Union has developed the CENTRAL EUROPE program 2014\u20132020 to foster cooperation in several areas between the Lombardy Region along with other Northern Italian Regions and several states of Central Europe. The region can broadly be divided into three areas in regards to productive activity: Milan, where the services sector makes up for 65.3% of the employment; the provinces of Varese, Como, Lecco, Monza and Brianza, Bergamo and Brescia, where it is highly industrialised, although in the two latter provinces, there is also a rich agricultural sector in the plains; the provinces of Sondrio, Pavia, Cremona, Mantova and Lodi, where there is a consistent agricultural activity, and at the same time an above average development of the services sector. The productivity of agriculture is enhanced by a well-developed use of fertilisers and the traditional abundance of water, boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction (partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci) of a wide net of irrigation systems. Lower plains are characterised by fodder crops, which are mowed up to eight times a year, cereals (rice, wheat and maize) and sugar beet. Productions of the higher plains include cereals, vegetables, fruit trees and mulberries. The higher areas, up to the Prealps and Alps sectors of the north, produce fruit and wine. Cattle (with the highest density in Italy), pigs, and sheep are also raised. The unemployment rate stood at 5.6% in 2019. Regional unemployment was one of the lowest in Italy. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 !2010 !2011 !2012 !2013 !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !2019 |- |unemployment rate (in %) |3.7% |3.4% |3.7% |5.3% |5.5% |5.7% |7.4% |8.0% |8.2% |7.9% |7.4% |6.4% |6.0% |5.6% |} ==Government and politics== Palazzo Lombardia, the main seat of the government of Lombardy. Politics in Lombardy is framed within a system of representative democracy, where the President of the Region (') is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is vested in the Regional Government (') and legislative power is vested in the Regional Council ('). Historically, the moderate Christian Democrats maintained a large majority of the popular support and the control of the most important cities and provinces from the end of the Second World War to the early 1990s. The opposition Italian Communist Party was a considerable presence only in southern Lombardy and in the working class districts of Milan; their base, however, was increasingly eroded by the rival centrist Italian Socialist Party, until eventually the Mani Pulite corruption scandal (which spread from Milan to the whole of Italy) wiped away the old political class and parties almost entirely. This, together with the general disaffection towards the central government (considered as wasting resources to balance the budgets of the chronically underdeveloped regions of Southern Italy), led to the sudden growth of the secessionist Northern League, particularly strong in the mountain and rural areas. In the last twenty years, Lombardy stayed as a conservative stronghold, overwhelmingly voting for Silvio Berlusconi in all the six last general elections. Notwithstanding, the capital city of Milan elected progressive Giuliano Pisapia at the 2011 municipal elections and the 2013 regional elections saw a narrow victory for the center-right coalition. On 22 October 2017 a non-binding autonomy referendum took place in Lombardy. The turnout was a low 38.3%, of which 95.3% voted in favor. The regional government of Lombardy is still under negotiation with Rome for the devolution of certain competencies. ===Administrative divisions=== The region of Lombardy is divided in 11 administrative provinces, 1 metropolitan city and 1,530 communes. The provinces/metropolitan cities of Lombardy {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Province/Metropolitan city ! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Area (km2) ! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Population ! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Density (inh./km2) |- | Province of Bergamo | 2,723 | 1,108,853 | 407.2 |- | Province of Brescia | 4,784 | 1,265,077 | 264.4 |- | Province of Como | 1,288 | 599,905 | 465.7 |- | Province of Cremona | 1,772 | 361,610 | 204.4 |- | Province of Lecco | 816 | 340,251 | 416.9 |- | Province of Lodi | 782 | 229,576 | 293.5 |- | Province of Mantua | 2,339 | 414,919 | 177.3 |- | Metropolitan City of Milan | 1,575 | 3,259,835 | 2,029.7 |- | Province of Monza and Brianza | 405 | 864,557 | 2,134.7 |- | Province of Pavia | 2,965 | 548,722 | 185.1 |- | Province of Sondrio | 3,212 | 182,086 | 56.6 |- | Province of Varese | 1,211 | 890,234 | 735.1 |} ==Culture== Beside being an economic and industrial powerhouse, Lombardy has a rich and diverse cultural heritage. The many examples range from prehistory to the present day, through the Roman period and the Renaissance and can be found both in museums and churches that enrich cities and towns around the region. Major tourist destinations in the region include (in order of arrivals ) the historic, cultural and artistic cities of Milan (4,527,889 arrivals), Bergamo (242,942), Brescia (229,710), Como (215,320), Varese (107,442), Mantua (88,902), Monza (75,839) and the lakes of Garda (429,376), Como (322,585), Iseo (123,337) and Maggiore (71,055). ===UNESCO World Heritage Sites=== The Rock Drawings in Valcamonica The Last Supper, Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie, Milan, Italy (1499), by Leonardo da Vinci Fortified City of Bergamo Remains of Roman forum in Brescia There are nine UNESCO World Heritage sites wholly or partially located in Lombardy. Some of these comprise several individual objects in different locations. One of the entries has been listed as natural heritage and the others are cultural heritage sites. At Monte San Giorgio, on the border with Swiss canton Ticino just south of Lake Lugano, a wide range of marine Triassic fossils have been found. During the Triassic period, some 240 million years ago, the area was a shallow tropical lagoon. Fossils include reptiles, fish and crustaceans and also some insects. Two sites are of pre-historic origin. The Rock Drawings in Valcamonica date back to a period between 8000BC and 1000BC, covering prehistoric periods from the Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic to the Iron Age. The engravings show depictions of a wide range of topics including agricultural and war scenes alongside more abstract symbols. The multi-centred heritage site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps includes 111 individual objects in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Slovenia, of which ten are located in Lombardy. Each of these objects consists of remnants of buildings erected on wooden piles in sub-alpine rivers, lakes and wetlands, built between 5000BC and 500BC. In general, only the submerged wooden parts have been preserved in the alluvial sediment, although in some places pile buildings have been reconstructed. Another multi-centred site, Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568\u2013774 A.D.), comprises seven locations across mainland Italy which illustrate the history of the Lombard period which has given the region its name. Two of the individual sites are in the modern region of Lombardy: the fortifications (the castrum and the Torba Tower) and the church of Santa Maria foris portas (\"outside the gates\") with its Byzantinesque frescoes at Castelseprio, and the monastic complex of San Salvatore-Santa Giulia at Brescia. The UNESCO site of Brescia also includes the remains of its Roman forum, the best-preserved in Northern Italy. The Church and Dominican Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan with \"The Last Supper\" by Leonardo da Vinci represent architectural and painting styles of the Renaissance period of the 15th century. The towns of Mantua and Sabbioneta are also listed as a combined World Heritage site relating to this period, here focussing more on town planning aspects of the time than on architectural detail. While Mantua was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries according to Renaissance principles, Sabbioneta was planned as a new town in the 16th century. The Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy are a group of nine sites in northwest Italy, of which two are in Lombardy. The concept of holy mountains can also be found elsewhere in Europe. These sites were created as centres of pilgrimage by placing chapels in the natural landscape and were loosely modelled on the topography of Jerusalem.
