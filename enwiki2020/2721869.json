Engel signed on as an assistant director at Warner Bros. in 1933. Three years later he was hired to be a producer at 20th Century Fox. After serving with the OSS and US Navy in World War II, he continued as a film producer with 20th Century Fox until 1962. Engel was president of the Screen Producers Guild from 1955 to 1958, and was instrumental in promoting its merger with the analogous guild of television producers to form the Producers Guild of America. ==Selected filmography== * We're Going to Be Rich (1938) ==External links== * Category:1904 births Category:1984 deaths Category:American film producers Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:United States Navy officers Category:People of the Office of Strategic Services Category:20th- century American businesspeople ",
