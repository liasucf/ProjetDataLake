    "text": "The H. M. Wilson is a tugboat especially designed for service in Churchill, Manitoba, the only Arctic Ocean port connected to the North America railroad grid. The vessel was designed by the well-known naval architectural firm, Robert Allan Ltd.. She was designed to be broken down into several loads that could each be shipped on a railroad flatcar, to be reassembled in Churchill. She was designed with a relatively flat bottom, due to the lack of any nearby ports with maintenance facilities. When her hull needs to be serviced or inspected, she beaches herself. She is equipped with a water cannon, for fighting fires. She was built to operate in icy waters. ==See also== * George Kydd ==References== Category:Tugboats of Canada Category:Water transport in Manitoba Category:1985 ships ",
