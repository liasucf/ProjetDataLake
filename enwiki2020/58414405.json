    "text": "Fujiwara no Atsutaka (\u85e4\u539f \u6566\u9686; 1060s\u20131120) was a Japanese nobleman and waka poet of the Heian period. His real name may have been Tachibana no Atsutaka. == Life == Fujiwara no Atsutaka was a son of the governor of Hizen Province, Fujiwara no Toshikiyo (\u85e4\u539f\u4fca\u6e05). His year of birth is unknown, but the 's entry for the 27th day of the seventh month of H\u014dan 1 (22 August 1120 in the Julian calendar) says that he was in his fifties when he died earlier that same month. The Sonpi Bunmyaku does not mention a \"Fujiwara no Atsutaka\", but it includes a reference to \"Mokunosuke Atsutaka\" (\u6728\u5de5\u52a9\u6566\u9686), son of \"Tachibana no Toshikiyo\" (\u6a58\u4fca\u6e05). Atsutaka's court position was Mokunosuke (Assistant Director of the Mokury\u014d \u6728\u5de5\u5bee), and his father's name was the same, so it is believed that these two were the same individual. The Ch\u016by\u016bki records that he was assigned to the Mokunosuke post in Eich\u014d 1 (1096). He appears to have held this position until his death. According to the Ch\u016by\u016bki, Atsutaka died on the first day of the seventh month of H\u014dan 1 (27 July 1120). === Descendants === His daughter married Minamoto no Toshiyori, and from this union was born Shun'e. == Poetry == He participated in the Sanka Goban Uta-awase (\u5c71\u5bb6\u4e94\u756a\u6b4c\u5408) in Tennin 3 (1110). Counting both \"Tachibana no Atsutaka\" and \"Fujiwara no Atsutaka\", his name appears in the surviving records of four uta-awase contests from this period. None of his poems, however, were included in any of the court anthologies. He was also noted for his scholarship, and compiled the 20-volume Ruiju Kosh\u016b (\u985e\u805a\u53e4\u96c6), a thematically-arranged collection of Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poems. Sixteen volumes of the work are extant. == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Works cited === * * Category:Waka poets Category:11th- century Japanese poets Category:12th-century Japanese poets Category:Kuge Category:1060s births Category:1120 deaths ",
