    "text": "Depictions of a fictional theocratic societies recur in science fiction, speculative fiction and fantasy. Such depictions are mostly dystopian, and in some cases humorous or satirical; positively presented theocracies are very much the exception. Some fictional theocracies are based on a future or alternate history development of actual religions, whilst in others the religions depicted are wholly fictional. The following table is sorted by time of publication (for series, time of earliest publication). ==Literature== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Title !! Author !!

Strict morality is enforced, adultery and fornication are criminal offences carrying stiff penalties. Most severely punished and abhorred is what is called \"The Sin Against Nature\". A strict dress code is enforced, women must wear ankle-length dresses at all times. Women who strongly insist on it can have their own careers, but this is actively discouraged and life as mothers and housewives is considered the right choice. Couples who don't have children suffer a social stigma. After an initial period of intolerance, the Church and Protectorate have come to reluctantly tolerate other religions (Jews, remnants of older Christian denominations) but their members suffer considerable social disablities.
