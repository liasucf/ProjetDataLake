    "text": "The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class A was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives. From 1893 to 1900, Crewe Works built 111 of these engines, which had a three-cylinder compound arrangement, and were designed by Francis Webb. According to the LNWR Society, 110 were built between 1894 and 1900. ==Rebuilding== Like the other Webb compounds, they proved problematic, so in 1904 George Whale began rebuilding these to simple expansion engines. Fifteen were converted to Class C between 1904\u20131906, 62 to Class D between 1906\u20131909, with the remaining 34 rebuilt by Charles Bowen Cooke to Class C1 between 1909-1912. All Class D locomotives were later rebuilt to Class G1. Some of them, rebuilt to Class G2a, were still running in 1962. ==Classification== The LNWR letter classification system for 8 coupled engines (A, B, C, etc.) was introduced in 1911. ==References== ==Further reading== * * A Category:0-8-0 locomotives Category:Compound locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1893 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:D n3v locomotives ",
