    "text": "The 2011 Russian Professional Rugby League season will be the seventh edition of the competition since its transition from the Super League. The reigning champions, VVA Monino will be attempting to secure a recording breaking ninth championship and overtake Krasny Yar as the most successful Russian rugby union side in the professional era. There have again been a number of changes and events taking place behind the scenes at the Russian Rugby Union. At the start of the season, rumours spread that the league would again expand, possibly to as many as fifteen (15) teams. Of the potential new entrants, the most likely entrant was a team based in the city of Kazan, a former \"stronghold\" of rugby league in Russia. However, due to the commitments of the national team at the World Cup, it was decided that there would be no new teams added to the competition. To compensate, a lower division was created, called the First Division, wherein seven (7) teams will compete for the chance to be promoted to the \"Super League\". ==Competition format== Details of this season's competition format have not yet been decided. ==Teams== *VVA- Podmoskovye Monino, from Monino, Moscow Oblast. *Yenisy-STM Krasnoyarsk, from Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Oblast. *Krasny Yar Krasnoyarsk, from Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Oblast. *Slava Moscow, from Moscow, Moscow Oblast. *Imperia-Dynamo Penza, from Penza. *RC Novokuznetsk, from Novokuznesk *Fili Moscow, from Moscow, Moscow Oblast. *Spartak Moscow, from Moscow, Moscow Oblast. ==Warm-up fixtures and results== ==Table== ==Schedule and results== ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Information rugby portal *Russian rugby statistics *Heavensgame * 2011 Category:2011 in Russian rugby union Category:2011 rugby union tournaments for clubs Category:2010\u201311 in European rugby union leagues Category:2011\u201312 in European rugby union leagues ru:\u0427\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0431\u0438 2010 ",
