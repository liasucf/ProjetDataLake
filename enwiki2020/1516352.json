    "text": "Neale Donald Walsch (born September 10, 1943) is an American author of the series Conversations with God. He is also an actor, screenwriter, and speaker. ==Biography== Walsch was brought up as a Catholic by a family who encouraged his quest for spiritual truth. He informally studied comparative theology for many years. He says his books are not channelled, but rather that they are inspired by God and that they can help a person relate to God from a modern perspective. Walsch's vision is an expansion and unification of all present theologies to render them more relevant to our present day and time. He created Humanity's Team as a spiritual movement whose purpose is to communicate and implement his New Spirituality beliefs, particularly that we are all one with God and one with life, in a shared global state of being.John Style, \u201cWhat Happens When God Describes Utopia?: Neale Donald Walsch's Utopian Vision\u201d, Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal, nr. 1, Spring 2006, pp. 135\u2013147 ISSN 1646-4729 This state can be achieved, Walsch argues, by the act of helping other people: \"The fastest way to apply anything in your life is to help others to apply it... The fastest way to use any wisdom that resides in your soul is to help someone else... Because we are all one\".Being at One: Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel (Part 3 of 3, paragraphs 18\u201319) Walsch has nine children. He has a home in southern Oregon where he lives with his wife, Em Claire, who is a working poet. ==Career== Before writing the Conversations With God series, Walsch worked variously as a radio station program director, newspaper managing editor, and in marketing and public relations. In the early 1990s he suffered a series of crushing blows\u2014a fire that destroyed all of his belongings, the break-up of his marriage, and a car accident that left him with a broken neck. Once recovered, but alone and unemployed, he was forced to live in a tent in Jackson Hot Springs, just outside Ashland, Oregon, collecting and recycling aluminium cans in order to eat. At the time, he thought his life had come to an end. Despondent, he began his writings after working his way out of homelessness and following a stint as a radio talk show host.Edgar John Burns, Foundations of a Global Spiritual Awakening, AuthorHouse, 2003, , His first book, Conversations with God, was published in 1995 and became an international bestseller. It remained on the New York Times Bestseller List for 135 weeks. Six of his other books have made the Times list in the years since. He has published 28 books and his works have been translated into 37 languages. ===Media appearances=== In 2003, the film Indigo, written by Walsch and James Twyman and directed by Stephen Simon was released.

The article was subsequently pulled from Beliefnet.com and Walsch voluntarily withdrew from the roster of authors because of his error. Walsch explained that he found the anecdote in old computer files from years earlier, saw his son's name in the copy, and was fully convinced that the history had really happened to him and that he had just forgotten it, but \"remembered\" when he saw the anecdote in his file. He cited it as a classic case of false memory and said that he had been repeating the anecdote as his own in many speeches over the years, adding that he was \"chagrined and astonished that my mind could play such a trick on me\".\"Christmas Essay Was Not His, Author Admits\", New York Times, Motoko Rich, 2009-01-06 ==Writings== ===Conversations with God series=== Please see the Bibliography at Conversations with God. ===Other writings=== Walsch has written a number of other books which he describes as \"in the CwG cosmology\", none of which are dialogues with God, but provide the reader with Walsch's insights: # Applications for Living from Conversations With God (compilation of three books; Relationships, Holistic Living, and Abundance and Right Livelihood) (November 4, 1999) # Part of the Change: Your Role As A Spiritual Helper (June 1, 2005) # Conversations with God: The Making of the Movie (Photos & Stories) (by Monty Jones with Neale Donald Walsch) (August 10, 2006) # The Mother of Invention: The Legacy of Barbara Marx Hubbard and the Future of YOU (January 15, 2011) # When God Steps In, Miracles Happen (April 1, 2011) # The Essential Path: Making the Daring Decision to Be Who You Truly Are (June 2019) ===Supplemental material=== In addition to the books of the CwG series, there are also a number of guidebooks, meditation books, and other books adapted from the CwG series and referring to the CwG message.
