The state of Tasmania also includes Macquarie Island, which is about 1,600 km SE of South East Cape. South East Cape is one of the five southernmost capes that can be rounded by Southern Ocean sailors. The cape is also a reference point for sectors of the southern coastline of Tasmania. Much sea traffic passes near it, and many ships and boats have been wrecked or grounded there. ==See also== * South West Cape * South Coast Track * Extreme points of Australia ==References== == External links == * Continental Extremities of Australia * Picture of South East Cape * Map of the area with South East Cape on the right edge, South Cape, South West Cape, the Maatsuyker Islands with De Witt Island, The Sisters and Maatsuyker Island * Another map of the area between South East Cape and South West Cape and the Maatsuyker Islands Category:Southern Tasmania Category:Headlands of Tasmania Category:South coast of Tasmania ",
