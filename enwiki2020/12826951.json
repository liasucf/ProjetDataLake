He had the idea to produce fashionable clothes that incorporated protection from bullets. In 1993, Miguel Caballero conducted a test of one of his armoured garments by shooting a person wearing one, which led to the company slogan, \"I was shot by Miguel Caballero.\" He developed the first ever de-mining suits in 1995 in collaboration with the Colombian National Army. Miguel Caballero is the first Latin American company to meet the NIJ 0101.04 standard (1996) and the NIJ 0101.06 standards (2001). In 2006, Caballero opened the first boutique specialising in armoured garments in Mexico City, and in 2009 the company opened its first production plant in Cota, Cundinamarca in Colombia. In 2013, the company obtained its first patent for an Armoured T-shirt product in Colombia. In addition to the boutique in Mexico, Miguel Caballero opened its second international corporate office in Guatemala City in 2014. In 2015, Miguel Caballero obtained the ISO 14001 certification, the MC4-G and S33 brands were launched, and the first patent in Mexico for the Armoured T-shirt product was acquired. == Products == Miguel Caballero clothes claim to protect the wearer against bullets, knives, fire, water, and air. Caballero describes the material from which he creates his apparel as \"a hybrid between nylon and polyester,\" which is lighter and thinner than Kevlar, a textile often used in body armour.
