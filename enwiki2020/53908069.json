Vol. 3, p. 540-541 ==Background== Chekhov, for whom this would be the first publication in Novoye Vremya, originally signed it with his usual pen name A. Chekhonte (\u0410. \u0427\u0435\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435). On 27 (o.s. 14) February he received a telegram from the newspaper asking for the permission to publish it under his real name. \"Chekhov gave such a permission, but regretted it, for he was planning to publish something in medical journals and was keeping his real name for serious articles,\" A.S. Lazarev-Gruzinsky opined in his memoirs.Gruzinsky, A.

I share your opinion considering the finale which you dropped and am grateful for your criticism which I found very constructive. I've been writing for six years now but you are the first editor who'd taken the trouble of proving a perfectly reasonable explanation for the cut you've made.\" The dropped finale issue was also mentioned in Viktor Bilibin's early March letter: \"I've read your story in Novoye Vremya with great pleasure but failed to notice in it any old spinster that you'd [previously] mentioned.\" Chekhov's original manuscript has been lost and there is only the Novoye Vremya version of the story that is extant. ==Synopsis== Andrey Andreyitch, a shopkeeper, comes to the local village church to ask for prayers for his recently deceased daughter Maria, and is chided by the priest for the wrong kind of language that he\u2019d used in his written request. The shopkeeper\u2019s daughter was an actress, and quite a well known one, and he simply fails to understand why the clergymen are so offended by the word \u2018harlot\u2019 with which he described her occupation. The rendition of the prayers awaken in Andrey Andreyitch some tender memories of his beautiful, sensitive and intelligent girl, yet even mentally he keeps referring to her as \u2018harlot\u2019 for can\u2019t see how an actress could be described otherwise. ==References== ==External links== * \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0434\u0430, the original Russian text * The Requiem, the English translation Category:Short stories by Anton Chekhov Category:1886 short stories Category:Works originally published in Russian newspapers ",
