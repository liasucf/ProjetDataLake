There is a sense of scrambling to some of the forward motion; one imagines Braxton leading the others down a trail that keeps getting steeper and steeper. ...As decades pass, documents such as this are audible pages out of the Braxton diary, memorable moments out of a lifetime of superb musical achievement\".Chadbourne, E., Allmusic Review, accessed March 17, 2015 ==Track listing== All compositions by Anthony Braxton. # \"Composition 23N - Dedicated to Richard Teitelbaum\" - 11:35 # \"Composition 23P - Dedicated to Richard Abrams\" - 8:25 # \"Composition 23M - Dedicated to Warne Marsh\" - 9:55 # \"Composition 23(O) - Dedicated to Laurent Goddet\" - 10:30 ==Personnel== *Anthony Braxton \u2013 clarinet, contrabass clarinet, soprano clarinet, flute, sopranino saxophone, alto saxophone *Masahiko Sato - piano *Keiki Midorikawa - bass *Hozumi Tanaka - percussion (tracks 3 & 4) ==References== Category:Denon Records albums Category:Anthony Braxton albums Category:1973 albums ",
