    "text": "The Ladder Hills (Gaelic: Monadh an Fharaidh) are a range of hills in northeast Scotland which straddle the border between Aberdeenshire and Moray and form a part of the Grampian Mountains. The highest point of the range is C\u00e0rn M\u00f2r (English: big cairn) at which is classed as a Corbett; other named tops include Monadh an t-Sluich Leith (800m), Carn Liath (792m), Dun Muir (754m) and Little Geal Charn (742m). The hills are formed for the most part from late Precambrian age metamorphosed sandstones and mudstones; quartzites, psammites, pelites and semipelites which together form the Ladder Hills and Kymah Quartzite formations. These are placed within the Islay Subgroup of the Argyll Group, itself a division of the late Dalradian Supergroup. Parts of the range are formed from carbonate rich rocks. Metadolerite dykes intrude this sequence in places. The rock strata are intensely folded and typically dip steeply to the southeast or northwest.http://www.largeimages.bgs.ac.uk/iip/mapsportal.html?id=1002447 The Ladder after which the range is named is a high pass used by a path climbing beside the Ladder Burn from the Braes of Glenlivet then southeast down to Duffdefiance at the head of Glen Nochty near Strathdon. Carn Mor is accessed by walkers from both of these localities as well as the Bridge of Leachd on the A939 road to the southwest. The Ladder Hills lie within the north-eastern part of the Cairngorms National Park whilst an area of 4353.61 hectares of the hills are designated as a special area of conservation for its Alpine and Boreal heath and active blanket boghttps://sac.jncc.gov.uk/site/UK0030179 in addition to enjoying status as a site of special scientific interest. Wildlife includes golden plover, dunlin, dotterel and ravens.https://glenlivet- wildlife.co.uk/ladderhills.php ==References== Category:Mountains and hills of Aberdeenshire Category:Mountains and hills of Moray Category:Grampian Category:Cairngorms Category:Mountain ranges of Scotland ",
