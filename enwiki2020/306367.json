School of Visual Concepts letterpress shop at night The School of Visual Concepts in Seattle, Washington, is a vocational school training students and working professionals in the fields of graphic design, advertising art direction, advertising copywriting, web design, and marketing communications. Founded in 1971 by the husband-and-wife team of illustrators, Dick and Cherry Brown, the school's teaching philosophy is based on the premise that working professionals, not career teachers or full-time faculty, can provide the most current, relevant instruction. As such, SVC does not offer degrees, but does provide students with the ability to earn a certificate in their program of study. In addition to evening courses and daytime workshops in the marketing communications field, SVC also has the largest public letterpress printing teaching shops in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The school offers a variety of letterpress classes, giving students access to three Vandercook flatbed proofing presses, three clamshell platen presses, and a completely restored Reliance iron hand press. Notable alums include best-selling children's author, Leslie Patricelli. ==External links== *School of Visual Concepts Category:Education in Washington (state) Category:Universities and colleges in Seattle Category:Design schools in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1971 ",
