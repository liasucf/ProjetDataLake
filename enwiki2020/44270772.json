    "text": "Ruhland station is located in the town of Ruhland in northwestern Upper Lusatia in the south of the German state of Brandenburg on the Gro\u00dfenhain\u2013Cottbus railway and the W\u0119gliniec\u2013Ro\u00dflau railway. The station is a heritage-listed building. == History == Historical map of Ruhland node Rear view of Ruhland station, remnants of the former station kitchen and sanitary facilities The Cottbus-Gro\u00dfenhain Railway Company (Cottbus-Gro\u00dfenhainer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was founded at the end of the 19th century by the railway financier Karl Eduard Zachariae von Lingenthal. Ruhland station began operations with the opening of the Gro\u00dfenhain\u2013Cottbus railway on 20 April 1870. It became the administrative seat of the Upper Lusatian Railway Company (Oberlausitzer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), when it was established on 11 October 1871. The Upper Lusatian Railway opened the Kohlfurt (now W\u0119gliniec)\u2013Horka\u2013Ruhland railway line on 1 June 1874. Ruhland became an important hub in the Prussian railway network. On 1 September 1883 the company and Ruhland station were taken over by the Prussian state. It operated direct trains to Magdeburg, Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw) in Lower Silesia, Dresden, Prague and Cottbus. Today, the station, which was once a hub of services between the Province of Lower Silesia, the Duchy of Anhalt and the Kingdom of Saxony, is only a stop for regional traffic. == Planned expansion and renovation== Ruhland town and regional businesses are promoting the development and renovation of the station. Discussions between Ruhland and Deutsche Bahn have been going on for more than ten years. The euphoria of reunification has long since turned into scepticism. Deutsche Bahn stated in July 2010 that the first work on the station would be carried out from 2015 to 2019. It was estimated that the work would cost \u20ac15,000. ===Intermodal terminal === Electric locomotive of the Rail4Chem between Ruhland and BASF Schwarzheide (in the background is the bridge of the B169) Ruhland station has a significant role in handling traffic to and from the premises of BASF Schwarzheide GmbH, which is about three kilometres away in the neighbouring town of Schwarzheide. Currently about 60,000 freight movements are handled annually at the station. ==Former branch lines== In 1875, the Upper Lusatian Railway Company opened a branch line from Ruhland to the Lauchhammer iron works that later connected to the Zschipkau-Finsterwalde Railway (Schipkau- Finsterwalder Eisenbahn, ZFE). Passenger services closed in 1962. The section from Ruhland to Lauchhammer Ost still serves as an industrial siding, mainly for handling the traffic from BASF Schwarzheide to and from BASF\u2019s factories in Ludwigshafen am Rhein. == Services == === Rail services === Three Bombardier Talent 2 electric multiple units of DB Regio in July 2014; left is RE 18 to Dresden, middle RE 18 to Cottbus, right S4 to Geithain The following services stop at Ruhland station (as of 13 December 2015): {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
