At the age of 4, his family moved to Suzhou, where he lived the rest of his life until his death in 1997. Raised in a musical family, he learned the guqin from his father, and in 1921 became a student of Wu Jinyang. From a young age, he enjoyed sports and martial arts. In 1928 he began studying the Yang Style of Tai-chi with Chen Weiming. One year later, he became a student of Li Shangyuan, who is a student of Hao Weizeng a descendant of the Wu (Martial) Style Taichi family. After many years of study he created his own style of tai-chi based on Daoism. Wu Zhaoji is popularly revered as an archetypal \"literatus\" qin player; his smooth, detached, intellectual, yet vigorous style made him one of the most highly regarded amateur players in the late 20th century. The \"Wu\" school of qin playing currently centered in Suzhou takes him as a leading figure; noted players to transmit his style include Wang Duo and Yuan Jung-ping. == See also == :Please see: References section in the guqin article for a full list of references used in all qin related articles. == References == Category:1908 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Guqin players Category:People's Republic of China musicians Category:Republic of China musicians Category:Musicians from Hunan Category:20th-century Chinese musicians ",
