However, it was the new medium of television that made him famous. From 1959 until the 1980s, he appeared in many TV comedy shows: Servisna stanica, De\u017eurna ulica, Spavajte mirno, Sa\u010dulatac, Crni sneg, Ljudi i papagaji, Ljubav na seoski na\u010din (in which Silvana Armenuli\u0107 guest starred), Kamiond\u017eije and Vru\u0107 vetar. \u010ckalja retired in the late 1980s and spent his last years peacefully. His last public appearance was during the DOS election campaign in 2000 in the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. In 2005, a statue of \u010ckalja was placed in front of his birth house in Kru\u0161evac. In 2006, a street in the Zvezdara neighborhood in Belgrade was named after him. ==Partial filmography== *Jezero (1950) - Crkvenjak *Crveni cvet (1950) - Profa *Cetiri kilometra na sat (1958) - Profesor psihologije *Dilizansa snova (1960) - Kir Janja (voice, uncredited) *Ljubav i moda (1960) - Komercijalni direktor *Zajednicki stan (1960) - Pepi *Nema malih bogova (1964) - Jordan *Sreca u torbi (1961) - Jordan *Put oko sveta (1964) - Jovance Micic *Na mesto, gradjanine Pokorni!
