They are distinct from the Franciscan Sisters of Christ the King in the United States. ==History== The congregation was founded in 1937 by Mother Bridget Sequeira (a native of Saligao, North Goa, then part of Portuguese India) in Karachi, which was a part of British India. The congregation chose a white sari with a border of three red lines printed along the edge. The three border lines represented the three vows of chastity, poverty and obedience that the Religious make.Sister Ursula, F.M.C.K. Foot Prints On The Sands Of Time.

On 19 May 1943 the sisters took charge of the Seth Mulchand Municipal Maternity Home on Britto Road. The sisters administered the maternity home efficiently for over thirty-five years. The sisters opened a chapel dedicated to St. Clare, and daily Mass was attended by residents of Soldier Bazaar and Catholic Colony. After Independence the sisters visited the Catholic residents of Soldier Bazaar regularly, teaching catechism and preparing children for the sacraments. They visited the sick and the aged of Soldier Bazaar and Catholic Colony, administering medication and checking blood pressure. They relinquished their charge of the Home on 18 April 1979.Mascarenhas, Oswin (2011).

It has since spread to various remote parts of India. The congregation also helped to train the first of the Poor Sisters of Our Lady, a congregation founded in Mumbai, India, in 1939. The mother house of the order is located in Old Goa, Goa.The Mail Archive website Accessed 24 January 2017 === Sri Lanka === In 2006, four sisters started working in Sri Lanka. ==Administration== Due to the increasing numbers of members and apostolates spread through various regions of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, a need was felt to decentralize the administration for better efficiency and organization. During its 10th General Chapter held in 2005, the congregation decided to divide its administration into two provinces: the Province of St Francis of Assisi in Pakistan and St. Clare's Province in India. The Province in India consists of the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, Archdiocese of Mumbai, Dioceses of Vasai and Pune. Sister Fatima Rodrigues, F.M.C.K., was elected as the new Superior General of the congregation in June, 2016, at their Generalate in Old Goa. There are 174 sisters working in remote areas all over India. A Formation House (a centre of learning for women who wish to enter the congregation) and Generalate (centre of administration) for the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King was constructed in Old Goa in 2005. It consists of classrooms, dormitories, refectory with kitchen and a chapel in a two-story building.Architizer LLC website, New York ==Notable members== * Mother Bridget Sequeira * Gertrude Lemmens * Ruth LewisVatican News Accessed August 1, 2020 ==References== ==External links== *News article from 2010 by The Navhind Times on the election of a new Superior General Category:Christian organizations established in 1937 Category:Catholic religious institutes established in the 20th century Category:Catholic Church in Pakistan Category:Congregations of Franciscan sisters Category:Franciscan missionary orders Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:1937 establishments in India ",
