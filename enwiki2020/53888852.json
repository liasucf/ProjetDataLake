By 1907, it brought together unions representing 126,700 members. Despite its name, it only included unions representing workers in the cotton industry; the wool industry and textile finishing were instead covered by the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trade.Edwin Hopwood, A History of the Lancashire Cotton Industry and the Amalgamated Weavers' Association, pp.75-76 Another similar organisation, the United Textile Factory Workers' Association, devoted itself to political work, and two of its members (the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives and the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners) never joined the federation.Lynden Briscoe, The Textile and Clothing Industries of the United Kingdom By 1960, the federation's members were: * Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine) * Amalgamated Tape Sizers' Friendly Protection Society * Amalgamated Textile Warehousemen's Association * Amalgamated Weavers' Association * General Union of Loom Overlookers * Lancashire Amalgamated Tape Sizers' Friendly Society * Lancashire and Yorkshire Warp Dressers' Association ==General Secretaries== :1906: Tom Shaw :1919: Luke Bates :1943: Andrew Naesmith :1953: Lewis Wright :1968: Harry Kershaw :c.1970: Arthur Howcroft :1971: Fred Hague ==References== Category:National trade union centres of the United Kingdom Category:Trade unions established in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Cotton industry trade unions ",
