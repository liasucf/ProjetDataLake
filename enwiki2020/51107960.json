She was abducted by and forced to marry Gilles of Brittany, brother of Francis I, Duke of Brittany and Peter II, Duke of Brittany, in 1444. She was widowed in 1450, when her spouse was imprisoned and died on the instigation of Arthur de Montauban, who wished to marry her. By the help of Fran\u00e7oise d'Amboise, she married Guy XIV de Laval in 1451. In 1488, she was appointed governess to Anne of Brittany and her sister Isabelle.
