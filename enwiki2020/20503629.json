Cerro de Punta , the highest peak in Puerto Rico, is located in the western section of the forest and the lowest elevation is found at the south edge of the forest near Salto de Inab\u00f3n (Inab\u00f3n Falls), an altitude of approximately . ==Forest types== Tree ferns like this Cyathea are abundant at Toro Negro Bosque Estatal Toro Negro life zone-to-elevation relationships Four vegetation associations have been delineated in two bioclimatic life zones. The two climatic biome zones are: the subtropical moist forest life zone (31% of the forest) and the lower mountain wet forest life zone (the remaining 69% of the forest). The topography is accentuated by a large number of steep slopes and high waterfalls. Toro Negro subforests are catalogued on the basis of their elevation and content. From Cerro Maravilla, one of the tallest peaks in the forest, four of Puerto Rico's distinct forest types can be seen: Bosque Tabonuco, Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia, Bosque Sierra de Palmas, and Bosque enano. ===Bosque Tabonuco forest=== At the lower elevations of the forest (below above sea level) stands the Bosque Tabonuco forest which is dominated by the majestic Tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa) that can reach up to and grows primarily in protected sites at low elevations. The Tabonuco forest has many of the characteristics for which tropical rain forests are noted. The forest canopy has three levels: an upper level that may be as much as 35% Tabonuco, a lower canopy, and an under story. The second most prominent tree in this forest type, the Montillo (Sloanea berteroana), has large buttress roots, typical of many rain forest trees. Such roots help support the heavy canopy of large trees growing in very wet soil. The forest floor is only scarcely vegetated, but the forest canopy is rich with aerial plants: bromeliads, orchids, vines, and arboreal ferns. The tabonuco type dominates in the subtropical wet life zone. ===Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest=== Above is the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest. Tree height in the Micropholis Buchenavia forest is less than , and the layers of the forest canopy are less distinct than in the Tabonuco type. Micropholis and Buchenavia (Granadillo) are the dominant species in this lower montane zonal vegetation association. ===Sierra de Palmas forest=== At about the same elevation as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest (above ), but on very steep slopes, are the Sierra de Palmas forests dominated by the sierra palm (Prestoea montana). Sometimes called palm-breaker, this forest type may reach in height. The Sierra de Palmas covers the largest area of all forest types in Toro Negro. The palm forest is distinguishable at a great distance by the form and size of leaves and by the general pale green color of the foliage. Below elevation the palms appear as scattered elements; however at higher elevations the sierra palm becomes a dominant species over a large area. The trunk of the sierra palm is straight, erect, cylindrical and attains heights of . The pinnate leaves are mostly long and cast a dense shade on the ground. The palm forest, nearly always a single species dominant is normally open and free from undergrowth of any kind. The globose fruits are somewhat more than one centimeter in diameter and produced in great abundance. ===Bosque Enano forest=== At the highest elevations, near the top of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest, elfin forest and moss forest. This forest type is composed of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The cloud forest has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate\u2014heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover. The dwarf or cloud forest developed in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the cloud forest of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an even surface, but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded and uneven in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking. In the Toro Negro forest, only the most inaccessible mountain tops have never been cleared. Most of the lower areas are subject to the familiar routine of logging, clearing, burning, and grazing or semi-permanent cultivation. Most of the forest lands in Toro Negro rise above the upper limit of successful coffee cultivation. ==Geology== Toro Negro State Forest has both deep soils and surface soils. Deep soils are derived from volcanic igneous rock, fine- grained. These contain high amounts of permeable clay, low amounts of sand, silt, and high amounts of iron and aluminum, but little silica. The surface soils are acidic and brittle while the subsoil is acidic and heavy, but permeable. Its hills are mostly steep. Usually the top soil is lost by erosion.\"Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro\".

This trail has its course along Cerro El Bolo (El Bolo Mountain), Puerto Rico's tenth tallest peak at above sea level.\"USGS: Geographic Name Information System\". US Department of the Interior. 13 February 1981. Retrieved 21 August 2013. It is a low challenge trail. It is essentially a loop that starts at the visitors' parking area on PR-143 and terminates on PR-143 about 1/4 mile north of the visitors' parking area, from where hikers simply walk the road back to the parking area. Starting off at the visitors' parking area, hikers cross PR-143 to head south on the trail. This section of the forest has many banana trees and flowers along its way and starts off with a steep uphill climb. Approximately into the trail, the trail starts to head East and flattens out as it becomes a rocky at first and then grassy further on. Another heading East the trail connects to Trail #6 which leads to the swimming pool. Continuing East another , the trail becomes uphill again as it connects to the northernmost point of a paved road, Puerto Rico Highway 561, on the right hand side. From this point on the trail starts to head North on a downhill grade but in less than it connects to Trail #3 which leads to the Observation Tower, where there is a sign that reads La Torre (\"The Tower\"). The trail continuous downhill North-Northwest about until it reaches paved road PR-143, in the vicinity of km 32.6. From this point hikers make a left to walk southwest bound on PR-143 (that is, \"West\" on PR-143) until reaching the visitors' area at km 32.4.\"Hiking in Toro Negro Forest\". Gwenn Makinowich. Puerto Rico Day Trips. 21 February 2013. Retrieved 2 August 2013. ==== Trail #3 (Observation Tower) ==== This trail leads to the Observation Tower. This trail if for advanced hikers. Trail #3 does not start at the visitors' parking area, so hikers must first hike on other trails to get to Trail #3. Starting from the visitors' parking area, there are three ways to get to Trail #3. Path Option 1: This is the shortest route. Hikers get on PR-143, walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head \"East\" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, make a right into the forest at the sign (\"Verada #6 - Piscina\") to get on Trail #6, hike the 0.8 mile of Trail #6 to its end, make a left into Trail #1 and hike about 0.3 mile to the beginning of Trail #3. Path Option 2: This is the second shortest route. Hikers take Trail #1 as described above under section \"Trail #1\" until they reach Trail #3 where there is a sign that reads \"Observation Tower\". Path Option 3: This is the longest route. Hikers head northeast bound (that is, \"East\" on PR-143) passed the sign stating \"Trail #6 - La Piscina (this will be about 0.25 mile hike), and continue northeast bound for approximately another 0.25 mile until the sign stating \"Trail #1 - Camino Bolo where hikers make a right into the forest and continue this trail about 0.9 mile until coming to Trail #3. Once on Trail #3, hikers climb this trail about 0.6 miles to its top where the observation tower is located. The trail to the observation tower lookout hill is not for the faint of heart. It is very steep and very slippery. It is a one-way trail (in the sense that the same trail is used in the return trip) and the trail feels even more slippery in the downhill return hike. This trail is made of rocks but, because of the high humidity and low traffic, algae have overtaken the rocks to make the trail very slippery. Walking around the rocks does not always help as the area is muddy - though albeit less slippery. The view and fresh air and breeze make the trek quite rewarding. The views are unobstructed and panoramic 360\u00b0 views are possible. The tower is 3,537 feet above sea level. Altogether the distance from the visitors' parking area to the tower is 2.14 miles. ==== Trail #5 (\"Las Cuarenta\") ==== Trail #5 is about 0.9 mile long and is a medium challenge trail. There is a significant amount of mud on this trail, but less so in the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitors' parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long), cross the bridge over the Do\u00f1a Juana Creek and then hop on Trail #8. From this point on Trail #8, hikers head West for about 0.2 mile where Trail #5 begins; its entrance is located on the right hand side. The trail heads North and leads to Puerto Rico Highway 564. The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.9 mile. The trail runs a thick tropical jungle of banana trees, sierra palms, tree ferns, flamboyant trees, and elephant ears. The trail is muddy, steep, and scantily-marked. Visibility is minimal through the dense foliage.\"In Puerto Rico: Jayuya and the Toro Negro State Forest\". Sally Kneidel. 1 May 2010. Retrieved 5 August 2013. There are several creeks near this trail and birds are abundant: black-throated blue warblers, northern parulas, green mangos, Cape May warblers, belted kingfishers, among others. After the 0.9 mile trek, the trail reaches PR-564. There is water pumping station on the left. From this point the \"trail\" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.6 mile where the northern terminus of Trail #9 (the Do\u00f1a Petra trail) is located to the right. Continuing southbound on PR-564 for another 0.1 mile, the road trail meets PR-143, where hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #5. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitors' parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trails #7 and #8 plus the hikes on roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #5 is 2.95 miles long, making it the second longest hike of all of Toro Negro's trails. ==== Trail #6 (The Pool) ==== This trail is about 0.5 miles long and a low challenge trail. The trail is well maintained, but the natural pool that it leads to is open during summer months only. Starting from the visitors' parking area, hikers get on PR-143 walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head \"East\" on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, then make a right into the forest at the sign (\"Verada #6 - Piscina\") to get on Trail #6. This trail runs along a river for about 1/4 mile before it comes to the sign \"Piscina\" pointing left. Continuing south on the trail, there are two eye-catching waterfalls visible from the trail. Continuing southbound and uphill, the trail goes through two flat and open areas with picnic tables. After this, the trail continues uphill and southbound for about 0.6 miles where it comes to its end, reaching Trail #1. Once at Trail #1, hikers either make a left or a right to get onto Trail #1 (trail #1 is a loop trail) or, of course, may turn around to return to the parking area via Trail #6. The entire length of Trail #6 is 0.8 miles. ==== Trail #7 (Camping Area) ==== This trail is actually a paved forest road leading to the Los Viveros camping area, Toro Negro State Forest's only campground. It is located north of the parking area. The \"trail\" is only 0.1 mile long, wide and flat, thus a low challenge trail. The trail is also the connecting trail to Trail #8, which leads to Charco La Confesora (see below). Another use of this trail is that it leads to one of the forest's three official picnic areas. Its picnic area is the one closes to the visitors' parking area. The Do\u00f1a Juana Creek runs next to the picnic area. ==== Trail #8 (\"Charco La Confesora\") ==== This trail is 0.54 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail, and leads to El Charco (\"The Pond\"), a natural swimming hole. It is located north of the parking area, and starts at the end of Trail #7. After hiking north from the parking area on Trail #7 (Trail #7 is a 0.1 mile long paved road), and hiking by the camping area, Trail #7 comes to an end at the Do\u00f1a Juana Creek. There is a sign pointing West (Charco Confesora) near the picnic area next to the camping area that serves as a landmark. At this point hikers walk over a little bridge to cross the creek, where Trail #8 begins. The trail heads northwest along the creek (the creek is located to the left of the trail) and the trail is abundant with wild flowers. It is a downhill trail and a bit muddy. A section of the trail consists of concrete steps. At the end of the trail is Charco La Confesora, a natural \"pool\", with a waterfall as a backdrop. swimming is allowed at this charco. The return path is the same as the path to the charco as the trail terminates at the charco. ==== Trail #9 (\"Do\u00f1a Petra\") ==== This trail is 0.4 mile long, it is a medium challenge trail. Like Trail #5, it is located north of the parking area, and starts where Trail #7 end. Also, like trail #5, there is a significant amount of mud on this trail, though less so during the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitors' parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long) and cross the bridge over the Do\u00f1a Juana Creek. Trail #9 begins at this bridge. Heading to the left from the bridge is the path for Trail #8, but heading straight up (northbound) gets hikers onto Trail #9, the Do\u00f1a Petra Trail. (Like trail #5, the \"Las Cuarenta\" trail, Trail #9 will also bring the hiker to State Route PR-564, but being a shorter trail, it does not encounter PR-564 as far north as Trail #5 does.) The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.2 mile, where according to ranger office maps, there used to be a trail to the left (i.e., westbound) leading to Trail #5. However, vegetation apparently overran such connecting trail because it is no longer visible. The trail then continues another 0.2 mile where it reaches PR-564. From this point the \"trail\" turns right, as PR-564 is intended to be part of the trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.1 mile where the \"road trail\" meets PR-143. At State Route PR-143 hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #9. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitors' parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trail #7 and roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #9 is 0.75 mile long. ====Trails #2, #4, and #10==== Trails #2, #4 and #10 are no longer active trails. Trail #2 was called Camino Ortolaza and was 0.5 mile long. It was a \"one-way\" trail (i.e., same entrance and exit) and ran from PR-143 to the Do\u00f1a Juana Creek. It started on PR-143 some 0.25 mile west of the entrance to the Area Recreativa/visitors' parking area and headed North ending at the Do\u00f1a Juana Creek, about 0.2 mile west of Charco La Confesora. Trail #4 was called Camino Vega Grande and was 0.4 mile long. It was another \"one-way\" trail and began on PR-143 about 0.1 mile east of the current Trail #1 eastern terminus. Trail #10 was called Camino El Tabonuco and was about 0.2 mile long. It was also a \"one-way\" trail. It originated at km 32.3 on PR-143 and headed north into the forest. ====Trail #11 (T9-to-T5 Connector)==== An unnamed trail, but referenced and marked in the DRNA maps, is a trail that could be termed Trail #11 for referential purposes. It was located midway on Trail #9 (that is, about 0.2 mile west of PR-546) and headed north to Trail #5. It met Trail #9 at a point about 0.2 mile west of PR-546. This trail was about 0.3 mile long. It served the double purpose of acting as a nature trail while at the same time it connected Trails 5 and 9, thus making for a shortcut from Trail #5 back to the car parking area via Trail #9. DRNA considers this unnamed trail a part of (an offshoot of) Trail #5. ===Campgrounds=== The campgrounds (camping area) at Toro Negro is called Los Viveros. It is located on PR-143, Km 32.5.Let's go to Puerto Rico. 3rd Edition. Page 300. Retrieved 1 August 2013. Its coordinates are at 18.17502\u00b0N, 66.49202\u00b0W ().

They are popular way of refreshing from the summer heat in the Toro Negro State Forest. The forest's \"official\" pool is accessed via Trail number 6, the La Piscina (\"The Pool\") trail. To reach trail 6, hikers start out from the forest office/parking area and hike north on route PR-143 about 1/4 mile. Trail 6 is located on the right hand side of the road. This pool is a river-fed pool. It became deteriorated, in disrepair and closed to public use sometime prior to 2010 and, in February 2013, there were unconfirmed reports that it had been repaired and reopen. In 2008, it was reported that an agreement between DNRA and the local community had been signed whereby the community would help repair the pool.\"Community Co-Management Agreement Signed for Orocovis Recreational Area\".

The mountain is the dividing landmark for the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. The mountain is accessible by car but the road is quite steep and many prefer to walk the road (it is about half hour's hike to the top) unless riding on an all-wheel drive vehicle. There is parking on PR-143 for those who prefer to walk to the hilltop. Another peak in the Toro Negro is Cerro Maravilla, infamous due to the murders of two independentistas youth at the hand of police in an ambush. This peak is also accessible by car from PR-143. The road leading to the top of Cerro Maravilla is PR-577 and is not as steep as that to Cerro de Punta (the Cerro de Punta road has no state signing.) This road is also much shorter, about 0.5 kilometer total length. Cerro Maravilla is located at 18.1532\u00b0N, 66.5543\u00b0W ().
