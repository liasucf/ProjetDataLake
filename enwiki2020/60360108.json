    "text": "Lim Soe Keng Sia (born 1818), also known as Liem Soe King Sia, Soe King Sia or Lim Soukeng Sia, was a prominent Peranakan figure in Batavia, the Dutch East Indies, best known for his rivalry with Betawi playboy Oey Tamba Sia. He was also administrator of the Ngo Ho Tjiang Kongsi, the most influential consortium of opium monopolists in early to mid-19th century Batavia. ==Early life== The atmosphere of Pekalongan Chinatown. He was born in Pekalongan, Central Java. Lim was a descendant of a family belonging to the Cabang Atas aristocracy. His family fell into poverty because of their extravagant lifestyles. As a descendant of Chinese officers, Lim held the title Sia. == Career == Lim understood Chinese and was also fluent in Dutch. Due to his family background and education, Lim was appointed son-in-law of Major Tan Eng Goan, the head of the Chinese government outpost in Batavia. Lim began working as an administrator of the Ngo Ho Tjiang Kongsi. In this role, he controlled the opium monopoly on behalf of the Dutch East Indies Company in Batavia. Oey Tamba Sia, also from Pekalongan, was the son and heir of the conglomerate and tobacco tycoon Lieutenant Oey Thai Lo. Lim and Oey started out as friends. Later, Lim was thought to be harassing one of Oey's female relatives. The two Peranakan figures fell out and became bitter enemies. Their feud peaked when Oey Tamba Sia poisoned his own employee, Oey Tjeng Kie, in an attempt to frame Lim Soe Keng Sia for murder and thus destroy his good name. However, Oey Tamba Sia himself was tried and found guilty. Oey and his accomplices were sentenced to hang in the field of the City Hall of Batavia. Lim was freed and his reputation restored. The story of Oey Tamba Sia and Lim Soe Keng Sia forms the basis of several Chinese-Malay literary works, and inspires Betawi folklore. ==References== Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:1818 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Pekalongan Category:Pachter ",
