There was a clubroom, a totalisator and a popular enclosure stand. The racing was interrupted by the war and the stadium closed before reopening on 24 February 1940. ===Tote returns=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Tote Returns |- !width=100|Year !width=100|\u00a3 |- !1939 | 9,398 |- !1941 | 7,990 |- !1942 | 8,257 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Tote Returns |- !width=100|Year !width=100|\u00a3 |- !1943 | 10,030 |- !1944 | 10,953 |- !1945 | 8,257 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"6\"|Tote Returns |- !width=100|Year !width=100|\u00a3 |- !1946 |30,326 |- !1947 | 25,968 |- !1948 | 24,785 |- |} ==Closure== The stadium closed on 18 April 1969. ==References== Category:Defunct greyhound racing venues in the United Kingdom ",
