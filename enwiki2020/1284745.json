    "text": "German trenches along the Aisne during World War I The Aisne running through Soissons The Aisne ( , also , ) is a river in northeastern France. It is a left tributary of the Oise. It gave its name to the French department of Aisne. It was known in the Roman period as Axona. The river rises in the forest of Argonne, at Rembercourt-Sommaisne, near Sainte-Menehould. It flows north and then west before joining the Oise near Compi\u00e8gne. The Aisne is long. Its main tributaries are the Vesle, the Aire and the Suippe. The Battle of the Axona was fought near there between the Romans and the Belgae in 57 BC. Three Battles of the Aisne were fought in the Aisne valley during the First World War. ==Places along the river== Departments and towns along the river include: * Meuse * Marne: Sainte-M\u00e9nehould * Ardennes: Vouziers, Rethel * Aisne: Soissons * Oise: Compi\u00e8gne * Aisne: Berny-Rivi\u00e8re ==Navigation== The river Aisne was a commercial navigation as early as the Gallo-Roman period, and rafts were floated from a long distance above the present limit of navigation at Vailly-sur-Aisne until the mid-19th century. Canalisation works were begun in 1836, at the same time as construction of the Canal lateral \u00e0 l'Aisne. The canal was completed first, in 1841, then two years later the river navigation. Commercial traffic in p\u00e9niches carrying 220 tonnes is still active, while recreational traffic is mainly private boats. The waterway is long, from the river Oise to the junction with the lateral canal, and has 7 locks. Through the lateral canal, it links with the Marne and the Canal de la Meuse. ===En route=== The kilometre distances continue the numbering from Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Aisne from east to west. *PK 51.3 is the end of the Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Aisne *PK 64.5 Villeneuve-Saint-Germain *PK 67 Soissons *PK 79 Fontenoy *PK 85 Vic- sur-Aisne *PK 92 Couloisy *PK 104.5 Choisy-au-Bac *PK 108 junction with Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Oise upstream of Compi\u00e8gne == See also == *Rivers of France *List of Canals in France *Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Aisne *Chemin des Dames *Battle of the Axona ==References== == External links == * River Aisne and Canal lateral \u00e0 l'Aisne maps and details about places, ports and moorings on the river, by the author of Inland Waterways of France, Imray * Navigation details for 80 French rivers and canals (French waterways website section) *World Book encyclopedia 1988 Category:Rivers of Aisne Category:Rivers of Ardennes (department) Category:Rivers of Marne (department) Category:Rivers of Meuse (department) Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Oise Aisne Category:Rivers of Grand Est Category:Rivers of Hauts-de-France ",
