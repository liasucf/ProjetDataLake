The Tzamplakones were an important and wealthy aristocratic family attested since the mid-13th century, when one of its members achieved the high military rank of Domestic of the Schools. Alexios Tzamplakon, Asomatianos' father, was this man's son.Kazhdan (1991), p. 2135PLP 27753 His brothers, Demetrios and Arsenios, also achieved high offices during the same period.Guilland (1967), p. 550 Asomatianos is first attested in 1348, as megas doux (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy). He was placed in charge of the Byzantine effort to construct a new fleet to use against the Genoese colony of Galata in the Byzantine\u2013Genoese War of 1348\u20131349. His fleet's inexperience and incompetence led to its destruction or capture by the Genoese. Tzamplakon survived the debacle, and died sometime before 1356. == References == ==Sources== * * * Category:1350s deaths Category:14th-century Byzantine people Category:Megaloi doukes Asomatianos Category:Year of birth unknown ",
