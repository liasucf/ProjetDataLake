    "text": "Live at the Fillmore -- February 1969 is a live album released by the American rock band the Byrds in 2000 on Columbia/Legacy. Compiled from two performances at the Fillmore West on February 7 and 8, 1969, the album includes several songs that are not found on any of the group's studio albums. Recorded less than a week after the release of the Byrds' album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, the band line-up on these recordings includes lead singer and guitarist Roger McGuinn, lead guitarist Clarence White, bassist John York, and drummer Gene Parsons. The album features White using the Stringbender device on his guitar, which he co-invented with drummer (and banjo player) Gene Parsons. The Stringbender allowed White to emulate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his Fender Telecaster guitar. Live At The Fillmore \u2014 February 1969 did not chart in either the U.S. or the UK. ==Track listing== #\"Nashville West\" (Gene Parsons, Clarence White) \u2013 1:57 #\"You're Still on My Mind\" (Luke McDaniel) \u2013 1:57 #\"Pretty Boy Floyd\" (Woody Guthrie) \u2013 3:13 #\"Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man\" (Roger McGuinn, Gram Parsons) \u2013 2:28 #\"Medley: Turn!
