Mrs. Southwick has a voice that is thoroughly trained to express every shade of thought and emotion; and this, together with her wonderful facial expressions, held the audience spellbound-- sometimes almost moved to tears, at other's thrilled with that enthusiasm which the battlefield alone can inspire.
