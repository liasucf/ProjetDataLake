    "text": "(Butadiene)iron tricarbonyl is an organoiron compound with the formula (CH)Fe(CO). It is a well-studied metal complex of butadiene. An orange-colored viscous liquid that freezes just below room temperature, the compound adopts a piano stool structure. The complex was first prepared by heating iron pentacarbonyl with the diene. ==Related compounds== Iron(0) complexes of conjugated dienes have been extensively studied. In the butadiene series, (\u03b7-CH)Fe(CO) and (\u03b7:\u03b7-CH)(Fe(CO)) have been crystallized. Many related complexes are known for substituted butadienes and related species. The species (\u03b7-isoprene)iron tricarbonyl is chiral. ==Related compounds== * Cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl ==References== Category:Carbonyl complexes Category:Organoiron compounds Category:Half sandwich compounds ",
