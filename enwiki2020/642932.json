    "text": "Hell's Wench over Ploesti, by Roy Grinnell Lieutenant Colonel Addison Earl Baker (January 1, 1907 \u2013 August 1, 1943) was commander of the 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) in the U.S. Army Air Forces who led the group on the low- altitude Allied bombing mission of oil refineries at Ploie\u015fti, Romania, Operation Tidal Wave. For his actions during World War II he received the United States of America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor (posthumously). Baker joined the Army Air Corps from Akron, Ohio in 1929, and earned his wings and a commission in 1931. ==Final mission== On August 1, 1943, the 93d Bomb Group, one of three from the Eighth Air Force sent to the Ninth Air Force especially for this mission, took to the air at Benghazi, Libya. Piloting Hell's Wench, a B-24 Liberator (Serial 42-40994), Baker led the 93rd as the second formation in the five-group mission of 177 aircraft. Co-piloting the aircraft was a volunteer and former member of the 93d, Major John L. Jerstad. En route the aircraft carrying the mission navigator crashed at sea. As a result, when the force reached the target area, the lead group turned at the wrong point and flew towards Bucharest. Baker attempted to warn the mission commander of this error, but when that failed, led the remainder of the force to the correct turning point. Although Hell's Wench was in flames and had been seriously damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, Baker maintained formation and bombed his target. Subsequently, Baker broke formation to avoid a mid-air collision with bombers from the lead group, now arriving in the target area from the opposite direction. He attempted to gain altitude so that his crew could escape by parachute, but despite his efforts, Hell's Wench crashed and exploded, killing Baker and the other nine airmen aboard. Although his body was never recovered he was given a memorial site in Florence American Cemetery and Memorial, Florence, Italy.American Air Museum ==Honors== On March 11, 1944, Baker was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Major Jerstad also received the Medal of Honor, on October 28, 1943, for his role on the mission. {| |150px |Army Air Forces Pilot Badge |} {| | |Medal of Honor |- | |Silver Star |- | |Distinguished Flying Cross |- | |Purple Heart |- | |Air Medal with two bronze oak leaf clusters |- | |Presidential Unit Citation with bronze oak leaf cluster |- | |American Defense Service Medal |- | |American Campaign Medal |- | |European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with silver campaign star |- | |World War II Victory Medal |} ==Medal of Honor citation== Rank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army Air Corps, 93d Heavy Bombardment Group.
