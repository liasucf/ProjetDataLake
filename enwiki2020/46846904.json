    "text": "EA 362, from Rib-Haddi, an equivalent-sized Amarna letter, with approximate similar appearance and length. (very high-resolution expandable photo) Amarna letter EA 245, titled: \"Assignment of Guilt,\"Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters. EA 245, Assignment of Guilt, p. 299-300. is a medium length clay tablet Amarna letter from Biridiya the governor-'mayor' of Magidda. It is letter number four of five from Biridiya. The letter is in pristine condition except for a missing flake (lower-right, obverse) causing a lacuna at the end of a few lines. The cuneiform characters are finely inscribed, with some photos that can even show the individual strokes of the cuneiform characters (the stroke sequence). The letter is 47-lines long, and about 5-in tall. Letter EA 245 (see here-(Obverse): ), is numbered BM 29855, at the British Museum. The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 20\u201325 years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters. ==The letter== ===EA 245: \"Assignment of Guilt\"=== EA 245, letter four of five.
