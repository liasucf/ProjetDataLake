O'Mahony made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was selected for the Kerry minor team in 1970. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team, however, he was an All-Ireland runner-up. O'Mahony subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning an All-Ireland medal in 1973. Later that year he joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1973-74 league. Over the course of the next nine seasons, O'Mahony won five All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph on the field of play in 1975, followed by a record-equalling four championships in-a-row as a non-playing substitute from 1978 to 1981. He also won eight Munster medals and one National Football League medal. He retired from inter-county football following Kerry's failure to secure a fifth successive All-Ireland title in 1982. O'Mahony participated in the 2014 series of Operation Transformation. ==Honours== ;Kerry *All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (5): 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981 *Munster Senior Football Championship (8): 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 * National Football League (1): 1973-74 *All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship (1): 1973 *Munster Under-21 Football Championship (1): 1973 *Munster Minor Football Championship (1): 1970 ;Munster *Railway Cup (2): 1976, 1978 ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Gaelic football goalkeepers Category:Spa Gaelic footballers Category:Kerry inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Munster inter-provincial Gaelic footballers Category:Participants in Irish reality television series ",
