    "text": "Park Eun-ooh (, born March 30, 1990), also known as NewNew, is a South Korean singer-songwriter, music producer, vocalist, and lyricist. ==History== ===2000s=== Park Eun-ooh made her debut as a singer in 2007 with her stage name Xeno(\uc81c\ub178) and published her first album \"Seventeen Xeno\". In 2008, her live performance \"Who are you? sexy My Boy\" in which she was portrayed as a cross-dressing girl became a hit for her masculine voice and dance. However, she made her comeback within 2 weeks on another live in maiden dress where she totally reversed her previous image. She later on changed her stage name from Xeno to Eun-ooh. ===2010s=== In the 2010s, Eun-ooh switched her focus from being a singer to mainly working as a composer, songwriter, vocalist, and producer for K-pop music and Korean TV series. For example, she worked on the OST \"Everyday\" for Korean Drama A Gentleman's Dignity in 2012. Since then, she has been writing melodies, lyrics, and helped produce songs for some of South Korea's best known K-pop artists, such as Sistar, BoA, and Jun Hyo Seong. ==Discography== ===Singles=== +Niga Mwonde(\ub2c8\uac00 \ubb54\ub370)- July 20, 2007 +Who are you? sexy my boy! \u2013 March 7, 2008 +Naege Dasi(\ub0b4\uac8c \ub2e4\uc2dc) \u2013 June 23, 2008 +Woori Ai(\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc544\uc774) \u2013 March 15, 2013 ===Soundtracks=== +A Gentleman's Dignity OST Part 2 \u2013 \"Everyday\" \u2013 June 3, 2012 ===Albums=== +Seventeen Xeno \u2013 September 20, 2007 == Songwriter/Lyricist/Producer Discography == === K-POP === ==== ShaFLA ==== * Ddu-Ru-Ddu-Ppa-Ra-Ppa ==== Jun Hyo Seong ==== * Dear moon * Hello * Follow me * I got you * Taxi Driver * How Can I ==== SONAMOO ==== * Round N Round * Liar * I do love you * Closer * Into Me ===== Song Ji Eun(SECRET) ===== * La Boum * Gayoon & HyunA (4Minute) - Come In [4Minute - 4Minute World (5th Mini Album)] ==== Shin Hye Sung ==== * Pretty Girl ==== B.A.P ==== * Today ==== Wonder Girls ==== * Sorry [Wonder Party (Mini Album)] ==== Lee Jong Hyeon (CNBLUE) & JUNIEL ==== * Love Falls MV ==== Nam-Young-Joo ==== Co-produced by 'Lee Jong Hyeon (CNBLUE)' & Park Eun Ooh ==== IVY ==== (Interview) Mini Album * Firefly * Like a movie ==== Ailee ==== Filling Up My Glass (Co-produced by 'Lee Jong Hyeon(CNBLUE) ==== EXID ==== Wi Are/Up & Down(chinese version) Cream (chinese version) ==== BoA ==== * Hurricane Venus * Adrenaline ==== Sistar ==== * SHAKE IT * Don't Be Such A Baby (Feat.
