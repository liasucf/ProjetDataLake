    "text": "Tropico del nord is an album released by the Italian rock band Pooh in 1983. According to the liner notes, it was the first album ever released on CD by an Italian band. It signals a change of direction for the band, with their earlier hard rock style replaced by a pop-oriented sound. Although the promotional tour proved that Pooh were still a strong draw, the album didn't fare as well on the charts as their previous releases. ==Track listing== # Cara sconosciuta (Dear Unknown) # Cosa dici di me (What do you say about me) # Lettera da Berlino Est (Letter from East Berlin) # Grandi speranze (Great Hopes) # Passaporto per le stelle (Passport to the Stars) # Solo voci (Only Voices) # Mezzanotte per te (Midnight for You) # \u00c8 vero (It's True) # Colazione a New York (Breakfast in New York) # Tropico del Nord (Tropic of North) ==Credits== # Roby Facchinetti - vocals and keyboards # Dodi Battaglia - vocals and guitars # Red Canzian - vocals and electric bass # Stefano D'Orazio - vocals and drums ==References== * Tropico del nord on the Italian Wikipedia Category:1983 albums ",
