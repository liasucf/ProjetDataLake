    "text": "Kristina Nilsdotter (Blake) (died 1254), was a Swedish noblewoman. Kristina and her spouse were portrayed by Snorre Sturlasson who visited them in 1219, and who reportedly gave him valuable information for his writings. She was the daughter of princess Catherine of Sweden and Norwegian nobleman Nils Blake. She married the Norwegian earl Hakon the Mad (H\u00e5kon Galen) in 1205. He was the half-brother of the Norwegian king Inge B\u00e5rdsson. She was the mother of Knut Haakonsson (c. 1208\u20131261) who was later a claimant to the throne during the Civil war era in Norway. After the death of H\u00e5kon, Kristina took their son Knut with her and returned to V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland where she married Swedish nobleman, Eskil Magnusson (c. 1175\u20131227), the lawspeaker of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland and elder brother of Birger jarl. ==References== Category:12th-century births Category:1254 deaths Category:13th-century Norwegian people Category:13th- century Swedish people Category:Medieval Swedish nobility Category:13th- century Norwegian women Category:13th-century Swedish women ",
