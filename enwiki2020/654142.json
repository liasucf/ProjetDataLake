He began performing as a dancer at age five, and has directed music videos and world tours for pop artists such as NSYNC and Britney Spears. Robson was the host and executive producer for The Wade Robson Project, which aired on MTV in 2003. In 2007, he joined the Fox television dance series So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge and choreographer. Robson was befriended by singer Michael Jackson as a child. When Jackson was first charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified at Jackson's trial, that Jackson never abused him. In 2013, he reversed that position, saying that Jackson had abused him consistently from when he was seven until he was aged fourteen. His allegations, and those of James Safechuck, are the subject of the documentary Leaving Neverland (2019). ==Career== ===Early career=== Robson was in a talent troupe called Johnny Young's Talent School, and the group did 14 shows a week, usually at venues like shopping malls. When he was nine, Robson moved to the United States with his mother and sister.

When Spears first interviewed Robson to choreograph her tour, she exclaimed, \"He's a friggin' baby!\"; she had expected him to be in his 30s or 40s. During the late 1990s, while still a teenager, Robson choreographed Spears's Pepsi commercials, including one which aired during the 2001 Super Bowl.

That same year, he directed Spears's Dream Within a Dream Tour. Robson and NSYNC's Justin Timberlake partnered in 2001, co-writing the hit singles \"Pop\", \"Gone\", and \"See Right Through You\" on NSYNC's final album Celebrity. Robson had initially written \"Celebrity\" for his own album, but was persuaded to let NSYNC record it instead.

When asked about working on the tour, Robson said, \"My wife and I are co-writing it and designing it. I'll choreograph probably a third of it and I'll hire other choreographers for different sections. We're in the midst of that.\" Rehearsals were set to begin in January 2009, however Robson and his wife were ultimately replaced by Jamie King.

He originally was set to direct Step Up Revolution (released in 2012), but dropped out of the project for personal reasons. He was replaced by Scott Speer. ==Relationships== ===General=== Robson dated Michael Jackson's niece Brandi, the daughter of Jackie Jackson for 7 years. Brandi states in the online Leaving Neverland counter-documentary Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary, that Robson and she met as children during a photoshoot with her uncle; Robson became attracted to Brandi and then asked Jackson to set the two up. The two were friends for ten years prior to the beginning of their relationship. Brandi also states that Robson cheated on her with Britney Spears during the latter's 1999\u20132001 tour, ending the pair's relationship, as well as the relationship between Spears and former boyfriend, Justin Timberlake; implying that Timberlake wrote \"Cry Me a River\" about Spears cheating on him with Robson. Neither Spears nor Timberlake has confirmed whether these rumors are true or not. Robson also dated dancer Mayte Garcia from 2000 until 2001. ===Relationship with Michael Jackson=== When Robson was five years old, he met Michael Jackson, who was touring Australia. Two years later, when Robson visited the US with his family to perform with Johnny Young's Talent School in Disneyland, California, Jackson invited the family to stay with him at his home, Neverland Ranch, also in California. In 2005, after Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified in his defense, saying he had slept in Jackson's bedroom several times but had never been molested. Jackson was acquitted. After Jackson's death in 2009, Wade said: \"His music, his movement, his personal words of inspiration and encouragement and his unconditional love will live inside of me forever.\" In 2013, Robson stated that Jackson had sexually abused him on two visits to the US and after he moved with his family to the US, when Robson was aged between seven and 14. Robson said his earlier denial was due to Jackson's \"complete manipulation and brainwashing\", and that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012. In 2015, Robson's case was dismissed by a Los Angeles judge, ruling that Robson had missed the 12-month statutory deadline after Jackson's death. The judge did not rule on the credibility of the allegations. The allegations by Robson and another man, James Safechuck, are the focus of the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland. ==References== ==Further reading== * == External links == * * Category:Living people Category:Australian male dancers Category:Australian choreographers Category:Cirque du Soleil Category:1982 births Category:People from Brisbane Category:Primetime Emmy Award winners Category:Australian male rappers Category:Australian expatriates in the United States Category:Australian people of American descent Category:So You Think You Can Dance choreographers Category:Michael Jackson sexual abuse allegations ",
