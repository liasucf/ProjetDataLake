    "text": "BBH 75 is the fourth album by French rock singer Jacques Higelin, released in 1974 on the Path\u00e9 Marconi label. It is a radical departure from his previous works with the Saravah label, as it is entirely a rock album. The album would bring Higelin commercial success and critical recognition from French rock circles, and the album is considered influential on the future of French rock. ==History== The title of the album is the initials of the three musicians from the album: Charles Bennaroch, Simon Boissezon and Jacques Higelin. The album was initially titled BBH 74, but as it was released near the end of 1974, it was finally retitled BBH 75. A rare promotional vinyl released back then bore the original title. ==Critical reception== The French edition of Rolling Stone magazine named it the 5th greatest French rock album.Rolling Stone, n\u00b018, February 2010.
