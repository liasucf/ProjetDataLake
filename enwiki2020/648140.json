He received his doctorate from the Imperial University of Dorpat, and then studied natural science in Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg. He joined the crew of the Aurora in the circumnavigation of the world. In 1853 Schrenck was sent by the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences to explore the Amurland on board the schooner Vostok. He reached the mouth of the Amur in September 1854 with the botanist Carl Maximowicz. In February 1855 he visited Sakhalin and then explored the Amur in the spring and summer. In 1856 he returned overland to Europe, via Lake Baykal. He published his findings in his Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande (1860).
