    "text": "Juana Larrauri de Abram\u00ed, also known as Juanita Larrauri (12 March 1910 \u2013 21 February 1990) was a tango singer and was among a group of the first women elected to the Argentine Senate. She was elected twice as a senator and in both cases lost her seat as a result of right-wing military coups; she was elected in 1951 and lost her seat in 1955, then was elected again in 1973 and lost her seat again in 1976. == Personal life == She was born in the Floresta neighborhood of Buenos Aires on 12 March 1910. In 1949 she married pianist and orchestral director Francisco Rotundo. She died in Buenos Aires on 21 February 1990 at the age of 79. == Singing career == In 1931 Larrauri began her career as a tango singer on LR3 Radio Nacional (later called Radio Belgrano). In 1936 she made her first record for Ode\u00f3n. Other radio stations on which she appeared included LS3 Radio Mayo, LS5 Radio Rivadavia, Radio Prieto and Radio Argentina. With Peronism's rise to power in the 40s she postponed her singing career, but she was still featured in 1952 as the singer in \"Evita Capitana\" \u2013 a feminine hymn to Peronsim \u2013 by Rodolfo Sciamarella, and in 1972 she recorded an album titled Canto para mi pueblo. She wrote the tango \"La piba de mano a mano\" (one of the tracks on this album) together with Tit\u00ed Rossi. Apart from her recordings and a few short tours in Argentina and neighboring countries, the bulk of her singing career was on radio. ==Political life== Larrauri joined a group of women that, led by Eva Per\u00f3n, pushed the passing of the law giving women the right to vote, approved in 1947. Larrauri joined the National Committee of Eva Per\u00f3n's Women's Peronist Party (Partido Peronista Femenino, or PPF) as the representative of Entre R\u00edos Province. Other members were \u00c1gueda Barro, Dora Gaeta, Mar\u00eda Rosa Calvi\u00f1o, Amparo P\u00e9rez, and Delia Parodi. In 1951 Larrauri was elected by the provincial legislature of Entre R\u00edos Province as one of its National Senators, joining a group of the first women to be elected to the Senate. That same year Larrauri sang \"Evita Capitana\", which became the anthem of the Women's Peronist Party. In 1952 she became the president of the Commission for the Eva Per\u00f3n Monument. She was deposed along with all the other elected representatives by a right-wing military coup (the Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora) on 16 September 1955, and was imprisoned by the resulting military dictatorship of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu. During the ban of Peronism (1955\u20131972) Larrauri became a major leader in the women's branch of the movement known as the \"Peronist Resistance\". When the ban on the Justicialist Party (Partido Justicialista) was lifted in 1972, she was a member of its Consejo Superior, representing the women's branch of the Peronist movement, which, at its core, took a position in opposition to Jorge Daniel Paladino. In 1972 she was part of the delegation which accompanied Juan Per\u00f3n on his return to Argentina. In 1973 she was re-elected as a national senator, and on 24 March 1976 was again deposed along with the other elected representatives when a right-wing military dictatorship under Jorge Rafael Videla overthrew Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n in a coup d'\u00e9tat. == Discography == * Canto para mi pueblo, 1972. == See also == * List of former Argentine Senators * List of tango singers == Notes and references == === Notes === === References === Category:1910 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Argentine female singers Category:Justicialist Party politicians Category:Members of the Argentine Senate Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Peronists Category:Tango singers Category:Women members of the Argentine Senate ",
