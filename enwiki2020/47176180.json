    "text": "EA 10 (high-resolution expandable photo) Amarna Letter EA10 (see here: ) is the letter of the Amarna series of diplomatic correspondence designated EA 10, which is written in cuneiform writing showing the continuation of a correspondence between Burna-Buriash II (otherwise known as Burra-Buriya\u0161) an ancient king of Babylon (named Kardunia\u0161 in the 1350BC Amarna timeperiod) , and Akhenaten (also known as Amenophis IV), an ancient pharaoh of Egypt. Some part of the contents of the letter indicates (in addition to EA11) that the Egyptian pharaoh married his daughters (named Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten) at a time when they were about 11 or 12 years of age. Within the letter Burna- Buriash II praises the craftsmen of the land of Akhenaten, and requests a model of an animal, either land or aquatic, and he is apparently indifferent to which of the two the pharaoh should choose to have created.S.
