    "text": "The Pascoli House Museum () opened in Castelvecchio Pascoli, Tuscany, Italy in 1960 and is devoted to the exhibition of the Italian writer Giovanni Pascoli's personal poetry. == History == Originally \"Cardosi-Carrara\" house, Pascoli bought it later to live and work regularly since October 15, 1895.The date was not a random choice: it is the day of the birth of Virgil, bucolic poet particularly dear to Pascoli. The idea of the museum came about in the 1950s, by his sister Mari\u00f9 (Maria), who left to Barga Municipality his manuscripts, letters, various memorabilia, and personal gifts to the institution in his will. Thanks to his sister Mari\u00f9, the house, built on three floors, has retained the appearance and structure that Giovanni Pascoli wanted during the years he lived there. The pieces reflect the tastes, friendships and knowledge, while the furniture and the many family memories reflect Mari\u00f9 and the world around Pascoli. === The chapel === Near the house is a chapel. Its fa\u00e7ade has a plaque which shows verses taken from his poem \"Il Sepolcro\". The chapel is where the poet and sister Maria are buried in a marble ark made by Leonardo Bistolfi; the artifacts and the frescos were created by Barghinese painter . == Gallery == Giovanni-Pascoli-a-Castelvecchio.jpg|Giovanni Pascoli with two farmers Giardino Casa Pascoli.jpeg|Pascoli house's garden Studio Giovanni Pascoli.jpeg|Giovanni Pascoli's desk == Bibliography == * M.
