    "text": "Geers' law is a phonological rule for Akkadian language according to which two different emphatic consonants (\u1e6d, \u1e63, \u1e33) cannot occur in one Akkadian word. It is named after Frederick Geers who discovered it in 1945. The law usually pertains to inherited Proto-Semitic roots whose emphatics were usually dissimilated. Compare:Cited after * Proto-Semitic *\u1e63\u0302b\u1e6d > Akkadian \u1e63ab\u0101tu \"to seize\" * Proto-Semitic *\u1e33\u1e6dn > Akkadian \u1e33at\u0101nu \"to be thin\" * Proto-Semitic *\u1e33\u1e63r > Akkadian ka\u1e63\u0101ru \"to bind\" * Proto-Semitic *\u1e63\u0302y\u1e33> Akkadian si\u0101\u1e33u \"to be narrow\" Such dissimilation is more likely if the emphatics were glottalized. It also affected loanwords, such as Amorite *q\u1e6dl > Akkadian \u1e33tl. In rare cases it did not apply, such as \u1e33a\u1e63\u00fb instead of ka\u1e63\u00fb. If Proto-Semitic emphatics were ejectives, then the Geers' law is explained as a manifestation of the widespread constraint in languages having ejectives, which forbids cooccurrence of two ejectives in a root. ==Notes== ==References== *. * * * Category:Akkadian language Category:Consonants Category:Sound laws ",
