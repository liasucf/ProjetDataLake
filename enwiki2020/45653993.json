She started working as a welder during World War II at the Kaiser Shipyards in Swan Island, Washington, where she met Clyde Barrow, whom she married in 1945 in Washington state. The couple moved to Chicago in the early 1940s, and Barrow attended the Moody Bible Institute to further her call to service. They lived on the South Side, and Barrow ran the youth choir at Langley Avenue Church of God. According to Barrow, she was approached by the minister to do some additional organizing for civil rights movement actions.

In a 1987 interview on Chicago Tonight she said, \"You see ministers, they would rather have a minister who could not articulate and perhaps may not have even been called ... than to have an articulate woman that knows something about the rebirth of Christ and knows about the natural birth and the new birth. They would rather try to have a man articulate than a woman. ... As Jesse [Jackson] grew, his vision grew. Anytime that there was a committee was formed, it would be all men. I'd say 'Jesse, you haven an unbalanced committee. You've got to have some women.' ... He kept putting women on committees, kept making them managers ... then it became a habit, a part of his vision.\" == Significant events attended == *1963 March on Washington *Bloody Sunday (1965) * She participated in the Project AIDS Memorial Quilt as acknowledged by The President and First Lady. * State of Illinois Center against the school strike on Sept. 22, 1987 * Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 26, 2008 as a superdelegate * 2001 March against U.S. Naval bombing in Vieques, Puerto Rico * Million Family March * She spoke on January 6, 1994 at a Violence Against Women forum.
