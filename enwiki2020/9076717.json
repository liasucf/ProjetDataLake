    "text": "The knee bursae are the fluid-filled sacs and synovial pockets that surround and sometimes communicate with the knee joint cavity. The bursae are thin- walled, and filled with synovial fluid. They represent the weak point of the joint, but also provide enlargements to the joint space.Platzer (2004), p 26 They can be grouped into either communicating and non-communicating bursae or, after their location \u2013 frontal, lateral, or medial. ==Frontal== X-ray of the knee of a 12 year old male, with knee effusion extending into the suprapatellar bursa. In front there are five bursae: # the suprapatellar bursa or recess between the anterior surface of the lower part of the femur and the deep surface of the quadriceps femoris.Burgener (2002), p 390 It allows for movement of the quadriceps tendon over the distal end of the femur. In about 85% of individuals, this bursa communicates with the knee joint. A distension of this bursa is therefore generally an indication of knee effusion. # the prepatellar bursa between the patella and the skin It allows movement of the skin over the underlying patella. # the deep infrapatellar bursa between the upper part of the tibia and the patellar ligament. It allows for movement of the patellar ligament over the tibia.Cipriano (2002), p 358. (A brief description of the \"clinically important bursae in the anterior aspect of the knee\") # the subcutaneous [or superficial] infrapatellar bursa between the patellar ligament and skin. # the pretibial bursa between the tibial tuberosity and the skin. It allows for movement of the skin over the tibial tuberosity. == Lateral == Laterally there are four bursae: # the lateral gastrocnemius [subtendinous] bursa between the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and the joint capsule # the fibular bursa between the lateral (fibular) collateral ligament and the tendon of the biceps femoris # the fibulopopliteal bursa between the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the popliteus # and the subpopliteal recess (or bursa) between the tendon of the popliteus and the lateral condyle of the femur == Medial == Medially, there are five bursae: # the medial gastrocnemius [subtendinous] bursa between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the joint capsule # the anserine bursa between the medial (tibial) collateral ligament and the pes anserinus \u2013 the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. # the bursa semimembranosa between the medial collateral ligament and the tendon of the semimembranosus # there is one between the tendon of the semimembranosus and the head of the tibiaGray's Anatomy (1918) # and occasionally there is a bursa between the tendons of the semimembranosus and semitendinosus == See also == * Lateral meniscus * Medial meniscus == Notes == == References == * * * * == External links == * Image at nlm.nih.gov Category:Synovial bursae Category:Lower limb anatomy Bursae ",
