    "text": "Dom Teod\u00f3sio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (Teod\u00f3sio de Bragan\u00e7a; ; 8 February 1634 - 13 May 1653) was the heir-apparent son of John IV of Portugal (first king of the House of Braganza) and his wife Luisa de Guzm\u00e1n (Lu\u00edsa de Gusm\u00e3o). In 1645 he was given the title of Prince of Brazil, a new crown- princely position thus created. Also, his father granted him the duchy as 10th Duke of Braganza, presumably after his uncle Duarte died in 1649. ==Biography== Portrait of the Prince of Brazil as a child. He was born on February 8, 1634 in Vila Vi\u00e7osa and was the heir to the throne of Portugal since then until his death at only 19 years of age. When the prince was 16 years old he took part in the State Council's reunions. D. Teod\u00f3sio's death, on May 13, 1653 caused great unrest in the kingdom. His next brother, the medically and mentally problem-ridden Infante Afonso, succeeded him as Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza and heir-apparent of the kingdom. Due to mental incapacity and impotence, Afonso would eventually be deposed by Pedro, Duke of Beja and died childless. ==Interests== D. Teod\u00f3sio was a very gifted young man. He knew Greek and Latin, was keen on philosophy and well respected amongst the great intellectuals of the time. The Prince had a great interest in Astrology. He had a collection of charts of his family and made predictions on several political subjects. His astrological interests were encouraged and aided by his tutor, the Jesuit priest Ant\u00f3nio Vieira. Under the tutelage of astrologers of the day, he composed many astrological charts. ==See also== *Prince of Brazil *Afonso VI of Portugal *Pedro II of Portugal ==Ancestry== ==References== *Dom Theodosio the Astrologer Prince *Genealogy of Prince Teod\u00f3sio ==External links== Category:House of Braganza Category:1634 births Category:1653 deaths Teodosio 3 Category:Princes of Brazil Category:Portuguese classical composers Category:Portuguese Baroque composers Category:Portuguese infantes Category:Portuguese royalty Category:Princes of Portugal Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century astrologers Category:Burials at the Monastery of S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded Category:17th-century classical composers Category:Portuguese male classical composers ",
