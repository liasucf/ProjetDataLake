Harrison's Reports, p. 186 that stars Edmond O'Brien, Robert Stack, and John Rodney. ==Plot== At an American air base in England in 1943, conniving, womanizing Sergeant Dolan (Tom D'Andrea) manipulates everyone, while insubordinate, maverick pilot fighter ace Major Ed Hardin (Edmond O'Brien) gives his commanding officer and close friend, Colonel Brickley (John Rodney), headaches by ignoring the out-of-date rules of engagement formulated by Brigadier General M. Gilbert (Shepperd Strudwick). When Major General Mike McCready (Henry Hull) promotes Brickley to whip a new squadron into shape, Brickley also recommends Hardin as his replacement. Despite his misgivings, McCready agrees. To everyone's surprise, Hardin strictly enforces the rules. One rule in particular, forbidding pilots to marry, irks his friend and wingman Captain Stu Hamilton (Robert Stack). As a result, when his tour of duty ends, Hamilton does not sign up for another, and instead goes home to marry his sweetheart. He later returns a married man, however, hoping to persuade Hardin to overlook his transgression. Hardin refuses to let him back into the squadron, but does weaken enough to let him fly one last mission. Unfortunately, Hamilton is shot down and killed; he admits to Hardin over the radio as his burning aircraft plummets to Earth that he had been distracted during the mission by thoughts of his wife. McCready decides that he needs Hardin for his staff, but allows him to first finish his current combat tour. Hardin's next mission is providing close air support for the Allied landings on D-Day. His aircraft is hit by flak and goes down in slow spiral. Hardin's final fate, though, is never revealed, as his squadron continues to support the D-Day invasion. ==Cast== * Edmond O'Brien as Major Ed Hardin * Robert Stack as Captain Stu Hamilton * John Rodney as Colonel Bill Brickley * Tom D'Andrea as Sergeant Dolan * Henry Hull as Major General Mike McCready * James Holden as Lieutenant Tennessee Atkins * Walter Reed as Captain Duke Chappell * Shepperd Strudwick as Brigadier General M.

He disparaged the \"lurid adventure episodes\" in the story, and commented that: \"The glamor-repute of the Air Forces and the 'hot rocks' who flew the fighter planes, which was cause for much ironic jesting among the lowly 'doughfeet' during the war, is the stuff that Warner Brothers has exclusively put upon the screen in its loud, Technicolored Fighter Squadron, which came to the Strand yesterday.\"Crowther, Bosley (November 20, 1948) \"The screen in review: Fighter Squadron, Warner Film dealing with wartime action, arrives at the Strand.\" The New York Times.
