He attended the University of British Columbia and graduated from the Arts faculty in 1918. He was called to the BC bar in 1921. == Mountaineering == Cayley was an ardent mountaineer and a member of the executive committees of the BC Mountaineering Club (BCMC) and the Vancouver section of the Alpine Club of Canada. He made of one the first winter ascents of the West Lion in February 1924, and one of the first ascents of Foley Peak (Easter 1924) and Mount Robie Read (May 1925). He also climbed Mounts Victoria, Ringrose, Huber, Pinnacle, Temple and other peaks of the southern Rockies. He made several ascents in the Robson District. He climbed Mt. Sir Donald in the Selkirks, Mt. Baker in Washington State, Mt. Garibaldi and other peaks of Garibaldi Park, and made numerous excursions to the mountains around Vancouver. Cayley's last climb was Mount Garibaldi in 1926. == Death and Legacy == In 1926, Cayley discovered that he was terminally ill with tuberculosis. He died on June 8, 1928. From July 7 \u2013 14, 1928, Cayley's friends completed an expedition in honour of Beverley, becoming the first to climb a volcanic mountain peak between the Cheakamus and Squamish Rivers, which they named Mount Cayley. His obituary was the first to appear in the BCMC monthly newsletter: \u201cThe passing of Mr BC Cayley, who for many years was an active member of our organization, came as a great shock to us. Possessed with the true spirit of the Mountaineer, Bev was one whose genial personality made for him a great circle of friends, who held him high in their esteem...\u201d The Beverley Cayley Prize at UBC was endowed through a bequest of his mother. The $200 prize is awarded to the male student obtaining the highest standing in a first year course in English. He is buried in Ocean View Cemetery. == References == Category:1898 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary Category:Lawyers in British Columbia Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:20th-century Canadian lawyers Category:Tuberculosis deaths in British Columbia Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Canadian mountain climbers ",
