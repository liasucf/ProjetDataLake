He accompanied the Salzburger Emigrants, German-speaking Lutheran settlers who were expelled from the Catholic principality of Salzburg, on their relocation voyage to Ebenezer, Georgia.Barlament, James. Salzburgers (19 October 2016), New Georgia Encyclopedia. He became a part of the first and third transports of the Salzburgers being responsible for secular affairs.Jones, George Fenwick (1984). The Salzburger Saga: Religious Exiles and Other Germans along the Savannah. Athens: University of Georgia Press. Von Reck was described by his contemporaries as charming and enthusiastic but totally inexperienced young commissary. He was stripped of his responsibilities after repeated disputes with Johann Martin Boltzius and the competing commissary Jean Vat. After the first voyage, von Reck left Georgia with vivid utopian descriptions of what he experienced. He wrote about Native Americans with great sympathy: His journal was published in 1734 in German and English.Reck, Philipp Georg Friedrich von.

He came back to Ebenezer on February 7, 1736 with the third transport of which he was in charge. Ultimately, Von Reck never formalized his land claim and returned to Europe where he entered the Hanover and later Danish civil service.Urlsperger, Samuel, George F. Jones, Renate Wilson, and Samuel Urlsperger (1968). Detailed Reports on the Salzburger Emigrants Who Settled in America. Athens: University of Georgia Press. Von Reck not only kept a journal of his time in America but also made his own drawings. However, the drawings and watercolor sketches were made public only in 1977 after they were discovered at the Royal Library in Copenhagen. They show his encounters with indigenous people, nature and wildlife in America. These images and journal are considered important source for the study of the Creek and especially Yuchi indigenous societies during the period of Von Reck's travels to America.Reck, Philipp Georg Friedrich von, and Kristian Hvidt (1980).
