    "text": "Ann Mui Oi-fong (\u6885\u611b\u82b3) (10 December 1959 \u2013 16 April 2000) was a singer and actress. ==Background== Born on 10 December 1959 in Hong Kong, she experienced much hardship in her childhood. Her father died when she was very young and her mother Tam Mei-kam (\u8983\u7f8e\u91d1) raised her brothers and sisters alone. Like her sister Anita, she has a dramatic contralto singing voice, which is a rarity in Chinese pop music. Despite not being twins, both Ann and Anita's singing voices were strikingly similar, with the only way to tell them apart was the hand in which they hold the microphone. She is best remembered for her supporting roles in many movies, especially Jackie Chan's Police Story 2. Mui died of cervical cancer, which was proven to be genetic as Anita later died for the same reason. She died in St.Paul Hospital, Causeway Bay. Her ashes were interred in Shang Sin Chun Tong, Kowloon Tong. ==Personal Life== In 1991, she married the father of her two sons, Poon Lap-Tak, whom she and her family was estranged from until her death in 2000. ==Filmography== * 1995 \u2013 Farewell My Dearest * 1992 \u2013 Police Story Part II * 1991 \u2013 Touch and Go * 1990 \u2013 Stagedoor Johnny * 1990 \u2013 Chicken A La Queen * 1989 \u2013 Burning Ambition * 1989 \u2013 The Iceman Cometh * 1989 \u2013 They Came to Rob Hong Kong ==References== * IMDB bio for Ann Mui * Ann Mui funeral coverage ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Deaths from cervical cancer Category:Hong Kong female singers Category:Hong Kong film actresses Category:Hong Kong Mandopop singers Category:Hong Kong television actresses Category:20th-century Hong Kong actresses Category:20th-century Chinese singers Category:Hong Kong contraltos Category:20th-century women singers ",
