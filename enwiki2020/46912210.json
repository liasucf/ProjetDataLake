    "text": "The 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 12, 2016, with the Pittsburgh Penguins defeating the San Jose Sharks four games to two in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals. For only the second time in league history (1970 being the only other time), none of the NHL's Canadian-based teams, seven in total, qualified for the postseason. In addition, for the second season in a row and only the fifth time since joining the league in 1979, all four former WHA teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Arizona Coyotes, Carolina Hurricanes and Colorado Avalanche) missed the playoffs. The Washington Capitals made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. This was the final season of the Detroit Red Wings' 25-season playoff appearance streak, the longest streak at the time and tied for third longest in NHL history. The Florida Panthers qualified for the playoffs for only the second time since the 1999\u20132000 season\u2014both times winning their division\u2014and fifth time in franchise history. For the fourth time in six years, all three California-based teams made the playoffs in the same season. And, for only the second time ever (1996 being the only other time), both Florida-based teams made the playoffs in the same season. For the first time since 2006, and only the third time in league history, all Original Six teams who made the playoffs (three in total) were eliminated in the first round. The New York Islanders won their first post-season series since the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, ending the third longest post-season win drought in NHL history. For the seventh consecutive season and eleventh out of thirteen seasons, a team from California was in the Western Conference Final. For the first time since 2002, no team lost in a four-game sweep in a playoff series. ==Playoff seeds== This was the third year in which the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The following teams qualified for the playoffs: ===Eastern Conference=== ====Atlantic Division==== # Florida Panthers, Atlantic Division champions \u2013 103 points # Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 97 points # Detroit Red Wings \u2013 93 points ====Metropolitan Division==== # Washington Capitals, Metropolitan Division champions, Eastern Conference regular season champions, Presidents' Trophy winners \u2013 120 points # Pittsburgh Penguins \u2013 104 points # New York Rangers \u2013 101 points ====Wild cards==== # New York Islanders \u2013 100 points # Philadelphia Flyers \u2013 96 points ===Western Conference=== ====Central Division==== # Dallas Stars, Central Division champions, Western Conference regular season champions \u2013 109 points # St. Louis Blues \u2013 107 points # Chicago Blackhawks \u2013 103 points ====Pacific Division==== # Anaheim Ducks, Pacific Division champions \u2013 103 points # Los Angeles Kings \u2013 102 points # San Jose Sharks \u2013 98 points ====Wild cards==== # Nashville Predators \u2013 96 points # Minnesota Wild \u2013 87 points ==Playoff bracket== ==First Round== ===Eastern Conference First Round=== ====(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (WC1) New York Islanders==== The Florida Panthers finished first in the Atlantic Division, earning 103 points.

In the United States, all playoff games were nationally televised by either NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, USA Network, and NHL Network. During the first round, these national telecasts co-existed with those of the regional rightsholders, after which NBC had exclusive rights to the remaining games. In Canada, all games were aired in English by either a Sportsnet channel or CBC (as part of Hockey Night in Canada), and in French by TVA Sports. With all seven of the NHL's Canadian teams out of the playoffs, media sources predicted that Rogers would take a massive decline in viewership. During the regular season, the Sunday-night Hometown Hockey games saw ratings drop 34 percent, while Hockey Night in Canada fell 18 per cent, culminating in the season closer on April 9 that attracted just 721,000 viewers. To cut production costs, Rogers only employed three full-time play-by-play crews, along with a fourth on spot duty, during the first round. In the second round, Rogers only sent a crew for games broadcast on CBC, while simulcasting NBC's feeds for all other games (which aired on Sportsnet). The Hockey News estimated that Rogers saved per game if they simulcasted a U.S. feed instead of producing their own separate broadcast. Ratings were also down in the United States, with the conference finals down by 9%, and ratings for the finals down to an average of 4 million viewers, making it the third-lowest- rated finals since 2006. The decline was credited to multiple factors, including the lack of Original Six teams or teams from key media markets such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and heavy competition from the 2016 NBA Playoffs and Game of Thrones (which aired against the series-ending game 6). ==References== Category:Stanley Cup playoffs Playoffs ",
