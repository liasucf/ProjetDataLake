Schicksal in Korea \u2014 Deutsche Missionare berichten. St. Ottilien 1974 () ==Early life== Ludwig, whose baptismal name was Otto, was born in Bous (Saar), Germany on June 15, 1907. His parents were the railway official Peter Ludwig and his wife Angela, n\u00e9e Fery. He attended secondary school in Saarlouis, where he obtained his degree in March 1927. Following his desire to become a missionary, he joined the Benedictine Order in the Abbey of St. Ottilien in Bavaria, where he professed on May 12, 1927. He studied theology and philosophy in St. Ottilien and Munich. On March 23, 1933, he was ordained to priesthood.Johannes Mahr Aufgehobene Haeuser. Die Missionsbenediktiner in Ostasien. St. Ottilien 2009, vol. 2 () ==Manchuria== In August 1934 Ludwig was sent to Manchuria - a puppet state under Japanese domination, situated in the border region between the then Japanese colony Korea, the Republic of China and the Soviet Union. After initial work on various mission stations in the area, among them Yenki Abbey, the newly founded station Sinchan was assigned to him.R.G. Tiedemann Reference Guide to Christian Missionary Societies in China from the 16th to 20th century. New York 2009 () It was designed to attract more mission areas in Inner Manchuria. In this poor, climatically extreme region he proselytized the partly Korean, partly Chinese population.Jean-Pierre Charbonnier Christians in China: A.D. 600 to 2000. San Francisco 2007 () In view of the linguistic and cultural barriers and the spreading acts of war his missionary work proved to be extremely difficult. He reported this in detail to his home abbey St. Ottilien and in his letters to his family in Germany. He described the dangers of marauding bands of robbers, the famines, the situation of the migrant workers \u2014 and also his loneliness. At the end of World War II, after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, first the Russians, then the Chinese occupied Manchuria. In May 1946, Ludwig was arrested as a \"spy\" by the Chinese Communists, interrogated and shortly after he was shot.Johannes Mahr Aufgehobene Haeuser. Die Missionsbenediktiner in Ostasien. St. Ottilien 2009, vol. 2 pp. 646-663 ==Honors== In June 2007, in honour of his 100th birthday, the church square in his hometown Bous was named after Ludwig. There are also efforts to have him beatified. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1946 deaths Category:German Roman Catholic missionaries Category:German Benedictines Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in China Category:German expatriates in China Category:German people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in Chinese detention Category:Deaths by firearm in China Category:20th- century Roman Catholic priests ",
