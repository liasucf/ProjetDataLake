He is best known for his multimedia company Lyrical Lemonade, which he initially created as an internet blog in 2013 as a high school student. == Early life == Bennett was born on May 14, 1996, in Plano, Illinois. He went to Plano High School. He dropped out of college to focus on his career in videography and hip hop music, something he wanted to do since childhood. == Lyrical Lemonade == Bennett originally founded Lyrical Lemonade as an internet blog when he was a high school student in Plano, Illinois. His mother came up with the name of the blog and also gave him a video camera. He soon began directing music videos for local Chicago rappers, including Vic Mensa and Taylor Bennett, which he uploaded onto the Lyrical Lemonade channel, along with live show recaps, cyphers, documentaries and interviews. The channel eventually expanded into other sub-genres of hip hop beyond the local Chicago scene, such as the emerging Soundcloud rap sub- genre. In 2016 and early 2017, he gained early recognition, working with artists such as Famous Dex, Lil Pump, Smokepurpp and Ski Mask the Slump God. On April 7, 2017, he released his first short film, \"Lone Springs\". In August 2017, he directed the music video for the Lil Xan single, Betrayed, which was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 2018. He later directed numerous music videos for hit songs, which include Ski Mask the Slump God's \"BabyWipe\", Lil Skies' \"Red Roses\" and \"Nowadays\" and YBN Nahmir's \"Bounce Out With That\". In May 2018, he became one of the most recognizable music video directors after directing the music video for Chicago rapper Juice Wrld's \"Lucid Dreams\", which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video has surpassed 480 million views on YouTube, becoming his most popular video on the channel. He has since worked with mainstream figures in hip hop such as J. Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Kanye West, and Eminem. In March 2020, he directed the music video for Eminem's hit single \"Godzilla\", which features a guest appearance from Juice Wrld, who died before the song's release. The video itself features cameos from Dr. Dre and Mike Tyson. It gained 13 million views in 24 hours. == Impact == Bennett's Lyrical Lemonade frequently promotes and contributes to the rise of upcoming rappers. Examples of this include Lil Pump, whose appearance on Lyrical Lemonade elevated his popularity to a certain extent. Other examples include Pump's friend and frequent collaborator Smokepurpp, Juice Wrld, Ski Mask the Slump God, YNW Melly, Lil Tecca, NLE Choppa, and Jack Harlow. Pitchfork named Ski Mask the Slump God's 2017 \"Catch Me Outside\" music video, which was directed by Bennett, one of their favorite music videos of the 2010s. == Other ventures == Bennett has also ventured into creating merchandise and lemonade beverages under the Lyrical Lemonade name. He said, \"I really want to compete with Minute Maid and all of the elite lemonade and juice companies and I really think we can do that.\" In February 2020, Lyrical Lemonade collaborated with Jordan Brand. The collection included an Aerospace 720 shoe, a hooded sweatshirt, and a long sleeve t-shirt. https://www.instagram.com/p/B7o985VBA4Z/ In April 2020, Lyrical Lemonade collaborated with streetwear brand FTP. The collection included a hooded sweatshirt, a t-shirt, and co-branded cans of lemonade. https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ajAY_BFER/ Bennett hosts a music festival called Summer Smash every year. It is presented by independent Chicago-based event production label SPKRBX. ==Videography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of music videos directed, showing year released, and YouTube views https://www.youtube.com/user/GooodLifeFilms/videos ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\"| Artist ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| YouTube views |- ! \"Call of the Wild\" | Bnova | rowspan=\"2\"| 2013 | 104K |- ! \"Self Demise\" | T0N3 | 49K |- ! \"No Name\" | Adot | rowspan=\"12\"| 2014 | 14K |- ! \"White Man Can't Golf\" | Supreme Regime | 3.1K |- ! \"Easy\" | Roy French | 16K |- ! \"IDK\" | Mojek | 13K |- ! \"Meditate\" | Roy French | 5.8K |- ! \"On My Way\" | Meeko Fly | 4.7K |- ! \"Grindin'\" | Lou Era | 4.3K |- ! \"Splash\" | Roy French | 6.1K |- ! \"Prey\" | Matt Whise | 3.3K |- ! \"Baller In Me\" | Spenzo | 3.6K |- ! \"Crack & French\" | Chris Crack | 2.9K |- ! \"Bang Bang\" | The Rap God Juice | 3.3K |- ! \"Bar Hoppin'\" | Young 99 | rowspan=\"22\"| 2015 | 3.6K |- ! \"No Control\" | Lou Era | 2.9K |- ! \"Preparation\" | Jinx the Natural | 4.1K |- ! \"Suppose to Be\" | Professor Mic | 1.4K |- ! \"All That\" | Monster Mike | 14K |- ! \"Coming Down\" | Jinx the Natural | 3.5K |- ! \"Sittin' On Ceilings\" | Roy French | 7.2K |- ! \"Pay Day\" | Marcus Nogood | 6.1K |- ! \"Dripstyle\" | Roy French | 10K |- ! \"Doppelganger\" | Tymaman | 3.5K |- ! \"Right Now\" | Evan Nash | 9.2K |- ! \"High Voltage\" | Jay Sly | 4.8K |- ! \"Flexin'\" | Roy French and Jinx the Natural | 3.8K |- ! \"Revolutionary\" | Ridgio | 3.5K |- ! \"Successors\" | OPTMST | 2.7K |- ! \"Anywhere\" | Ridgio | 3.4K |- ! \"Scarface\" | Rio Mutasim | 7K |- ! \"Time\" | GMEBE Lil Chief Dinero and GMEBE Bandz | 1M |- ! \"Rush Hour\" | SD | 13K |- ! \"The Arrival\" | Dacaid | 3.4K |- ! \"Cut It Freestyle\" | Spenzo | 34K |- ! \"Prom Dress\" | Spiff Meylor | 8.3K |- ! \"Struggle\" | GMEBE Lil Chief Dinero | rowspan=\"65\" |2016 | 300K |- ! \"Body Bags\" | Femdot | 39K |- ! \"Look At Me\" | Chuck Frost | 20K |- ! \"Intro\" | GMEBE Lil Chief Dinero | 198K |- ! \"How I Kick\" | ManMan The Rapper |40K |- ! \"Shooter\" | Jinx The Natural | 7.5K |- ! \"Black Man Lost\" | Vonte | 4K |- ! \"Contacts\" | Super Bwe | 109K |- ! \"Workin' It\" | Soulja Boy | 55K |- ! \"Hit Em Wit It\" | Famous Dex | 19M |- ! \"GTFO\" | Seany Doo | 25K |- ! \"Loan Le\" | Isaiah G | 50K |- ! \"I'm Paid\" | Famous Dex | 2M |- ! \"Slowly\" | Chuck Frost | 9.6K |- ! \"DMC\" | Famous Dex | 1.2M |- ! \"I'm Great\" | Famous Dex and Carl Phresh | 1.5M |- ! \"Again\" | Soulja Boy and Killa J | 74K |- ! \"Up Out My Way\" | Vonte | 7.5K |- ! \"Program\" | JayChris and Lucki Eck$ | 41K |- ! \"Juggin\" | J $tash | 61K |- ! \"HUDD\" | Sicko Mob | 148K |- ! \"How We Settle That\" | King Louie |18K |- ! \"STFU\" | Jinx The Natural | 19K |- ! \"I Need A 8\" | JayChris | 17K |- ! \"Speed Racer\" | Warhol.ss | 3.3M |- ! \"Pain & Success\" | Stitches | 53K |- ! \"Global\" | K9 | 17K |- ! \"Ski Mask\" | Smokepurpp | 6.8M |- ! \"King Dilla\" | Femdot | 20K |- ! \"GDAY Freestyle\" | Warhol.ss | 217K |- ! \"Unfadeable\" | Jeffrey Crook | 7.1K |- ! \"Reefa Dem\" | King Louie | 173K |- ! \"STFU\" | Famous Dex | 754K |- ! \"Gucci Chanel\" | Nike Boi | 177K |- ! \"Sneeze Kash\" | Katie Got Bandz | 26K |- ! \"Next Bitch\" | Brace Boogie |19K |- ! \"Woah Yeah\" | Famous Dex | 1.5M |- ! \"Gwop\" | Nike Boi | 68K |- ! \"Knew I Would\" | JayChris and U-Neek | 41K |- ! \"Go To The Wendy's\" | BRENTRAMBO | 160K |- ! \"Foamposite\" | Nike Boi | 219K |- ! \"Don't Know\" | Cdot Honcho | 2M |- ! \"Nothin 4 Me\" | Prince Tre | 127K |- ! \"Movie Scene\" | T Rock | 11K |- ! \"Know Me Now\" | Nike Boi | 81K |- ! \"Lemonade\" | rowspan=\"2\" |Famous Dex | 114K |- ! \"Run Around + Ridiculous\" | 711K |- ! \"WittaGang\" | Duffle Bag Guru | 39K |- ! \"Fuck Up A Sack\" | Lil Yachty and K$upreme | 376K |- ! \"Jakobe\" | Roy French | 46K |- ! \"When I Walk\" | Brace Boogie and Lil Messi | 22K |- ! \"Morning Light\" | Shawty The Kidd | 22K |- ! \"On My Waist\" | Warhol.ss and Famous Dex | 1.7M |- ! \"Like That\" | NuWorld Kayo | 21K |- ! \"Shoot\" | Famous Dex | 1.1M |- ! \"2017 Freestyle\" | Cdot Honcho | 2.5M |- ! \"Bag It\" | rowspan=\"2\" |Famous Dex | 772K |- ! \"With Yo B!tch\" | 10M |- ! \"Lineup\" | TC | 21K |- ! \"Free Man\" | Lil Messi, Brace Boogie and Diary Love | 21K |- ! \"Yung Andy\" | rowspan=\"2\" |Warhol.ss | 472K |- ! \"Get It\" | 167K |- ! \"Look Like\" | Yung Pinch | 10M |- ! \"For The Winter\" | Melly Flex | 24K |- ! \"F*cked Up\" | Chuck Frost | 35K |- ! \"Cold Front\" | Xavier Wulf | rowspan=\"55\" |2017 | 1.5M |- ! \"Achoo!\" | Keith Ape x Ski Mask the Slump God | 30M |- ! \"\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u0445\u0443\u0439\" | FACE | 14M |- ! \"Trust Me\" | LOREN | 81K |- ! \"Can\"t Tell Me Nothing\" | J.R.
