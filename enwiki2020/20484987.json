The ownership of the land passed to Cardiff Bay Development Corporation who created the retail park on an area of industrial units to the east of the site. Grangemoor Park was created opposite the retail park on the 20 metre hill landscaped on the old refuse site. == Units == ===Phase One=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! Unit(s) !
