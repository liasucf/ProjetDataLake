    "text": "\"Why Don't They Let Us Fall in Love\" is a song written by Phil Spector, Ellie Greenwich, and Jeff Barry. It was first recorded by American singer Ronnie Spector, who was credited as Veronica. In 1964, it was released as an A-sided single backed with \"Chubby Danny D\". It did not chart. The song was originally intended for the Ronettes, and was recorded at Gold Star Studios in March 1963, but Spector withheld its release for the reason that he did not feel it to be a number-one record. Instead, \"Be My Baby\" was issued. \"Why Don't They Let Us Fall in Love\" was not placed on an LP until Phil Spector Wall of Sound Vol. 6 \u2013 Rare Masters Vol. 1, a rarities compilation issued in the UK in 1976. In 1965, the New Orleans pop girl group the Dixie Cups released the single \"Gee the Moon Is Shining Bright\", an alternate version of the song with slightly reworked lyrics. Their version bubbled under the Hot 100 at number 102. It was the fourth and final single taken from their debut studio album Chapel of Love. ==Other versions== * 1965 \u2013 Sonny & Cher, Look At Us * 2008 \u2013 The Morning Benders * 2013 \u2013 The Beach Boys, Made in California (recorded July 1980) ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * Category:1964 singles Category:1964 songs Category:Songs written by Phil Spector Category:Songs written by Jeff Barry Category:Songs written by Ellie Greenwich Category:Song recordings produced by Phil Spector Category:The Ronettes songs Category:The Dixie Cups songs Category:The Beach Boys songs Category:Sonny & Cher songs Category:Red Bird Records singles ",
