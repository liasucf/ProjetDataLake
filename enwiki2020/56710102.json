    "text": "Hamilton Plains is a locality in the Whitsunday Region, Queensland, Australia. == Geography == The Proserpine River forms the western, southern and south- eastern boundary of the locality with Myrtle Creek forming the northern and north-eastern boundary. The land is flat and low-lying (approximately 10 metres above sea level). It is entirely freehold land used for cropping, predominantly sugarcane. The Bruce Highway traverses the locality from south to north-west. The North Coast railway line also traverses the locality from south to north-west, most of the way it runs immediately parallel and west of the highway. There is no railway station serving the locality. There is also a network of cane tramways to deliver harvested sugarcane to the mill in neighbouring Proserpine. == References == Category:Whitsunday Region Category:Localities in Queensland ",
