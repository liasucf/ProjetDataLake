Atat\u00fcrk had said that That's not my father when shown the picture.Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay, \u00c7ankaya: Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn do\u011fumundan \u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fcne kadar, Beta\u015f, \u0130stanbul, 1984, p. 17. This portrait had been suggested by \u0130lhan Sungu in his article titled \"Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Babas\u0131 Ali Efendi ve Mensup Oldu\u011fu Sel\u00e2nik Asakir-i M\u00fclkiye Taburu\"\u015eevket S\u00fcreyya Aydemir, Tek Adam: Mustafa Kemal, Birinci Cilt: 1881 - 1919, 14th edition, Remzi Kitabevi, 1997, , p. 32. and has commenced to be published as Ali R\u0131za's portrait in 1939. Ali R\u0131za Efendi (1839-1888) was the father of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and the husband of Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m. He was born in Selanik, (modern Thessaloniki in present-day Greek Macedonia) but then the most important city in the Ottoman Empire in Europe after Constantinople/Istanbul. He worked as a customs official and died in 1888 at age 49, when his son was 7 years old. He is thought to be of local descent: Albanian or Slavic by some scholars as Andrew Mango, Lou Giaffo, Ernst Jaeckh, etc.Andrew Mango Atat\u00fcrk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey, Overlook Press, 2002, , p. 25; p.27. \"Feyzullah's family is said to have come from the country near Vodina (now Edessa in western Greek Macedonia). The surname Sofuzade, meaning 'son of a pious man', suggests that the ancestors of Z\u00fcbeyde and Ali R\u0131za had a similar background. Cemil Bozok, son of Salih Bozok, who was a distant cousin of Atat\u00fcrk and, later, his ADC, claims to have been related to both Ali R\u0131za's and Z\u00fcbeyde's families. This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue. This suggests that some at least of their ancestors had originally come from Turkey, since local Muslims of Albanian and Slav origin who had no ethnic connection with Turkey spoke Albanian, Serbo-Croat or Bulgarian, at least so long as they remained in their native land., But in looks Ataturk resembled local Albanians and Slavs.[...] But there is no evidence that either Ali Riza or Z\u00fcbeyde was descended from such Turkish nomads.\" page 28; \"It is much more likely that Atat\u00fcrk inherited his looks from his Balkan ancestors.[...] But Albanians and Slavs are likely to have figured among his ancestors.\"Lou Giaffo: Albania: Eye of the Balkan VortexJackh, Ernest, The Rising Crescent, (Goemaere Press, 2007), p. 31, Turkish mother and Albanian fatherIsaac Frederick Marcosson, Turbulent years, Ayer Publishing, 1969, p. 144.Richmond, Yale, From Da to Yes: understanding the East Europeans, (Intercultural Press Inc., 1995), 212. However the village where his family was born has still a Turkish majority population, and Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay, journalist and close friend of Atat\u00fcrk, claimed he descends partially from Turks of S\u00f6ke, in Ayd\u0131n Province.Vamik D.

According to other historians such as Vamik D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, Hasan \u0130zzettin Dinamo, etc: Ali R\u0131za's ancestors were Turks, ultimately descending from S\u00f6ke in the Ayd\u0131n Province of Anatolia.Vamik D.
