This system replaced conventional steel springs with an adaptive system of hydraulic struts, resulting in a motoring experience that felt like no other automobile of the era.Fifty Cars That Changed the World by Design Museum, 2010, This suspension achieved its initial design brief, fast travel on poor road surfaces.Citroen DS: Design Icon By Malcolm Bobbit , 2005, , page 32 This advantage is still noted today, especially in applications where ride quality is important, like ambulance design.https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042712-134653/unrestricted/FINAL_AUCAS_MQP_Report.pdf His formal schooling was modest \u2013 he earned his National diploma (Brevet d'Etudes du Premier Cycle), a preparatory course for the Acad\u00e9mie des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Marseille. At age 17, he sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Citro\u00ebn, one of the major automobile manufacturers in France, where he was hired to maintain equipment.http://www.passion-citroen.com/l-histoire-citro\u00ebn/les-hommes-qui- ont-fait-la-marque/paul-mag\u00e8s/ in French In 1936 he became a technical draftsman, and in January 1942, CEO Pierre-Jules Boulanger assigned him to the development department, to solve problems in the development of braking and suspension systems (including for the Citro\u00ebn 2CV).http://www.citroen- forum.nl/nieuws/overig/portret_van_een_technisch_genie_paul_mages/ in Dutch Mag\u00e8s studied published material on automobile suspension. He was puzzled by the conventional wisdom that a supple suspension system was incompatible with good handling. He had been assigned the task of producing a car with both qualities. He realized that the solution must be located in a variable suspension, one that is very flexible at low speed, and stiff at high speed and load.http://www.citroen- forum.nl/nieuws/overig/portret_van_een_technisch_genie_paul_mages/ in Dutch 275px This questioning led to experimentation and the eventual development of hydro-pneumatic suspension system, which combines easily compressible gas in an enclosed chamber, combined with the non-compressible, force multiplication properties of hydraulic machinery. The heavier the load, the higher the gas pressure, so the suspension becomes more rigid. Mag\u00e8s ultimately concluded that hydraulic fluid under pressure, delivered by an engine driven accessory \u2013- a hydraulic pump \u2013 was the best way to achieve the desired result.Citroen DS: Design Icon By Malcolm Bobbit , 2005, , page 31 Mag\u00e8s may never have been able to solve this problem if he had better technical training. Marcel Pagnol, the French playwright, famously said \"Everyone thought it was impossible, except an idiot who did not know and who created it.\" Mag\u00e8s kept a copy of this statement on his desk.http://www.citroen- forum.nl/nieuws/overig/portret_van_een_technisch_genie_paul_mages/ in Dutch Mag\u00e8s also developed DIRAVI speed sensitive power steering, first used on the 1970 Citro\u00ebn SM.http://www.cnet.com/videos/top-5-citroen-sm-innovations-that- saw-the-future/ Many current vehicles use air suspension, to gain some of the advantages of hydro-pneumatic suspension, with slightly less perceived complexity, and use new developments in electronics to achieve speed sensitive power steering. The 1955 Citro\u00ebn DS, developed around Mag\u00e8s' engineering innovations, placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, behind the Ford Model T and the BMC/BL Mini. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1999 deaths ",
