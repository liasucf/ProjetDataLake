    "text": "The Grants-Milan Flight Service Station, at 1116 N. Dale Carnutte Rd. in Grants, New Mexico, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. It was then part of the Western New Mexico Aviation Heritage Museum, which honors early aviation pioneers who flew the Los Angeles-to-Amarillo segment of the Midcontinental Airway. It is a flight service station that was built in 1953 to serve the Grants-Milan Municipal Airport. \"The museum also includes two 1929 structures, a 55-foot beacon tower, an electric generator shed and a re-creation of the giant concrete arrow on the ground that helped direct aviators. Many of those concrete arrows survive in the western U.S.\" ==References== Category:Museums in Cibola County, New Mexico Category:Aerospace museums in New Mexico Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cibola County, New Mexico Category:Transportation buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Commercial buildings in New Mexico Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1953 Category:History museums in New Mexico ",
