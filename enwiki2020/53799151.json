    "text": "James Parnel or Parnell (baptised 1636 \u2013 1656) was an English Quaker preacher, author, and martyr. ==Life== Parnell was born at East Retford, Nottinghamshire, the son of Thomas and Sarah Parnell, and was apprenticed to his father. As a teenager he became a nonconformist, visited George Fox in prison in 1653, and joined the Society of Friends. Parnell is said to have been \u201cyoung, small of stature, and poor in appearance,\u201d but thousands in England were made to confess that \u201che spoke as one having authority, and not as the scribes.\u201d He was convinced of the Truth when only fourteen years of age, and became a mighty preacher and promoter of the gospel by sixteen. Following a debate with a prominent priest, Parnell was arrested on spurious charges of being an \u201cidle and disorderly person,\u201d and imprisoned at Colchester Castle. There he was confined to a small hole in the thick castle wall, twelve feet above the ground. He died from sickness and ill-treatment after ten months' imprisonment at the young age of nineteen. According to historian William Sewel, \"So great was the malice and envy of his persecutors, that to cover their guilt and shame, they spread among the people, that by immoderate fasting, and afterwards with too greedy eating, he had shortened his days. But this was a wicked lie.\"William Sewel, The History of the Rise, Increase, and Progress of the Christian People Called Quakers, With Several Remarkable Occurrences, pg. 143\"The Lamb's Defence against Lyes. And a true Testimony given concerning the Sufferings and Death of James Parnell. And the ground thereof.

It was twice reprinted in 1655, and again in 1658. It was translated into Dutch in 1656, into French as L'Espreuve de la Foy, 1660, and into German, Amsterdam, 1681. *The Fruits of a Fast, appointed by the Churches gathered against Christ and His Kingdom, London, Giles Calvert, 1655. *The Trumpet of the Lord blowne, or a Blast against Pride and Oppression, London, Giles Calvert, 1655. *A Shield of the Truth, or the Truth of God cleared from Scandalls and Reproaches, London, 1655. *The Watcher \u2026 or a Discovery of the Ground and End of all Forms, Professions, Sects, and Opinions, London, 1655. *Goliath's Head cut off with his own Sword; In a Combat betwixt Little David, the Young Stripling \u2026 and Great Goliath, the Proud Boaster, London, 1655.

He also wrote from prison, shortly before his death, epistles and addresses, as well as A Warning to all People (translated into Dutch, 1670), all of which were printed in A Collection of the several Writings given forth from the Spirit of the Lord, through \u2026 James Parnel, &c.; Published in the year 1675. ==Notes== == External links == * ;Attribution Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1656 deaths Category:Quaker ministers Category:English Quakers Category:17th-century Quakers ",
