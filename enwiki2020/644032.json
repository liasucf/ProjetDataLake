    "text": "In mathematics, the term adjoint applies in several situations. Several of these share a similar formalism: if A is adjoint to B, then there is typically some formula of the type :(Ax, y) = (x, By). Specifically, adjoint or adjunction may mean: *Adjoint of a linear map, also called its transpose *Hermitian adjoint (adjoint of a linear operator) in functional analysis *Adjoint endomorphism of a Lie algebra *Adjoint representation of a Lie group *Adjoint functors in category theory *Adjunction (field theory) *Adjunction formula (algebraic geometry) *Adjunction space in topology *Conjugate transpose of a matrix in linear algebra *Adjugate matrix, related to its inverse *Adjoint equation *The upper and lower adjoints of a Galois connection in order theory *The adjoint of a differential operator with general polynomial coefficients *Kleisli adjunction *Monoidal adjunction *Quillen adjunction *Axiom of adjunction in set theory Category:Mathematical terminology ",
