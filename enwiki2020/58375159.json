With The bridge came into ownership of the Great Northern Railroad, and was used as a railroad bridge until 1967. It was purchased in 1969 by a private owner who replaced rails by wooden planking and used it for automobile access to their property. It was located one mile from County Route 4, in the vicinity of Colfax, in Whitman County, Washington.
