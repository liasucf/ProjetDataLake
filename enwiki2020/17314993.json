F. (1972). A generalized isotropic yield criterion, Journal of Applied Mechanics, v. 39, n. 2, pp. 607-609. is a generalization of the von Mises yield criterion. It has the form : \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3|^n + \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1|^n + \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|^n = \\sigma_y^n \\, where \\sigma_i, i=1,2,3 are the principal stresses, n is a material-dependent exponent and \\sigma_y is the yield stress in uniaxial tension/compression. Alternatively, the yield criterion may be written as : \\sigma_y = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3|^n + \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1|^n + \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|^n\\right)^{1/n} \\,. This expression has the form of an Lp norm which is defined as :\\ \\|x\\|_p=\\left(|x_1|^p+|x_2|^p+\\cdots+|x_n|^p\\right)^{1/p} \\,. When p = \\infty, the we get the L\u221e norm, :\\ \\|x\\|_\\infty=\\max \\left\\\\{|x_1|, |x_2|, \\ldots, |x_n|\\right\\\\}. Comparing this with the Hosford criterion indicates that if n = \u221e, we have : (\\sigma_y)_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} = \\max \\left(|\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3|, |\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1|,|\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|\\right) \\,. This is identical to the Tresca yield criterion. Therefore, when n = 1 or n goes to infinity the Hosford criterion reduces to the Tresca yield criterion. When n = 2 the Hosford criterion reduces to the von Mises yield criterion. Note that the exponent n does not need to be an integer. === Hosford yield criterion for plane stress === For the practically important situation of plane stress, the Hosford yield criterion takes the form : \\cfrac{1}{2}\\left(|\\sigma_1|^n + |\\sigma_2|^n\\right) + \\cfrac{1}{2}|\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|^n = \\sigma_y^n \\, A plot of the yield locus in plane stress for various values of the exponent n \\ge 1 is shown in the adjacent figure. == Logan-Hosford yield criterion for anisotropic plasticity == The plane stress, anisotropic, Hosford yield surface for four values of n and R=2.0 The Logan-Hosford yield criterion for anisotropic plasticityHosford, W. F., (1979), On yield loci of anisotropic cubic metals, Proc. 7th North American Metalworking Conf., SME, Dearborn, MI.Logan, R. W. and Hosford, W. F., (1980), Upper-Bound Anisotropic Yield Locus Calculations Assuming< 111>-Pencil Glide, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, v. 22, n. 7, pp. 419-430. is similar to Hill's generalized yield criterion and has the form : F|\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3|^n + G|\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1|^n + H|\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|^n = 1 \\, where F,G,H are constants, \\sigma_i are the principal stresses, and the exponent n depends on the type of crystal (bcc, fcc, hcp, etc.) and has a value much greater than 2.Hosford, W. F., (2005), Mechanical Behavior of Materials, p. 92, Cambridge University Press. Accepted values of n are 6 for bcc materials and 8 for fcc materials. Though the form is similar to Hill's generalized yield criterion, the exponent n is independent of the R-value unlike the Hill's criterion. === Logan-Hosford criterion in plane stress === Under plane stress conditions, the Logan-Hosford criterion can be expressed as : \\cfrac{1}{1+R} (|\\sigma_1|^n + |\\sigma_2|^n) + \\cfrac{R}{1+R} |\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2|^n = \\sigma_y^n where R is the R-value and \\sigma_y is the yield stress in uniaxial tension/compression. For a derivation of this relation see Hill's yield criteria for plane stress. A plot of the yield locus for the anisotropic Hosford criterion is shown in the adjacent figure. For values of n that are less than 2, the yield locus exhibits corners and such values are not recommended. == References == == See also == *Yield surface *Yield (engineering) *Plasticity (physics) *Stress (physics) Category:Plasticity (physics) Category:Solid mechanics Category:Mechanics Category:Yield criteria ",
