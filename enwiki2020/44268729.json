    "text": "Roxbourne is a hamlet of London Borough of Harrow west of Rayners Lane in the north west of Greater London (Historically in the county of Middlesex). It is home to Yeading Brook and the Roxbourne Park which provides 26 hectares of open space including football and cricket facilities, the Roxbourne Rough Nature Reserve which is enriched with wild life and the Roxbourne (miniature) Railway. == Social Structure== The first census in 1801 simply divided people into those employed in agriculture and those in trade or manufacturing, and the 1841 census, the first to gather detailed occupational data, imposed no real order on it at all. However, the first occupational classification, introduced in 1851, was clearly concerned with social status as well as with what people made: it began with the Queen, followed by government officials and then by 'the learned professions'. ==References== ==External links== * Roxbourne Middle School * Roxbourne Infant School Category:Districts of the London Borough of Harrow Category:Areas of London ",
