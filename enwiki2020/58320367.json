Its parent organization is the Army Music Service of the Czech Armed Forces which heads all bands in the CAF. The band currently consists of 46 active musicians who are based in Prague. As of September 2018, the band is led by the Chief Director of Music, Gustav Foret and his deputy, Captain Richard Czuczor. ==Duties== The mission of the Czech Army Central Band is to provide the musical accompaniment needed for all types of national and private events. It specifically engages in activities related to the President, the Government Office, the Parliament and the Army.

Following the First World War, the Ministry of Defense of Czechoslovakia decided to create a medium sized music band. After a number of reorganizations, the band began to serve as the band of the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1945. Just 5 years later on 1 December 1950, the Central Music Service of the Czechoslovak People's Army was founded with close to 160 musicians in its ranks. Its first commander was Colonel Hynek Sluka, with his deputy being Major Karel Stastny. At the time, the Bands of the \u010cSLA was made up of three smaller groups of musicians (the other two groups being based in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and Olomouc). The new band became an independent unit within the 80th Infantry Battalion \"The Prague Uprising\".http://www.ustrednihudba.army.cz/z-historie-orchestru ==Repertoire and musical training== The Fanfare of President of the Czech Republic Besides classical music for the wind orchestra and marching music for the brass band,https://www.rundel.de/de/brass_ensemble_of_the_czech_army_central_band/p-3/1586 the army band performs melodies from popular films and songs from musical groups such as Queen and the Beatles. During concert activities, the Czech Army Band uses the works of many Moravian authors (notably Milo\u0161 Machek, Mojm\u00edr Zedn\u00edk, Franti\u0161ek Ma\u0148as, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Volf).http://vholomouc.army.cz Notable pieces include: *Intro of Bedrich Smetana's Libu\u0161e (Fanfare of President of the Czech Republic) *Fanf\u00e1ra \u010d\u00edslo 1 *Pochod \"K Defil\u00e9\" *Uv\u00edtac\u00ed pochod *Slavnostn\u00ed pochod by V\u00e1clav Dobi\u00e1\u0161 All members of the band are graduates of many military and national conservatories in the country. Most musicians are graduates of the Jan\u00e1\u010dek Academy of Music and Performing Arts (JAMU) or Prague Academy of Performing Arts (AMU). The training the band receives from JAMU and AMU is often reflected in the artistic quality of the band and the complexity of their performances. ==Collaborations== The band often cooperates with many national organizations that provide musical accompaniment during its events. The most notable Czech organizations the band has worked with includes Czech Radio (\u010cRo), where the band often plays Kde domov m\u016fj during newshours, as well as the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra, of whom the band usually performs in joint concerts. As a NATO member, and a member of the European Union, the band also frequently tours Europe to be participants in many international festivals and performances that are held in countries like Denmark, Poland, Austria, Scotland,http://www.army.cz/en/ministry-of-defence/newsroom/news/central-band- and-ondras-ensemble-excel-at-the-edinburgh-tattoo-festival-202196/ Germany, Norway,https://www.mzv.cz/static/146550-1-MZV/en/current_news/norwegian_military_tattoo_2012.html and Italy.
