    "text": "Structure of 1,2,3,4-tetrazine Structure of 1,2,4,5-tetrazine Tetrazine is a compound that consists of a six-membered aromatic ring containing four nitrogen atoms with the molecular formula C2H2N4. The name tetrazine is used in the nomenclature of derivatives of this compound. Three core-ring isomers exist: 1,2,3,4-tetrazines, 1,2,3,5-tetrazines, and 1,2,4,5-tetrazines, also known as v-tetrazines, as-tetrazines and s-tetrazines respectively. ==1,2,3,4-Tetrazines== 1,2,3,4-Tetrazines are often isolated fused to an aromatic ring system and are stabilized as the dioxide derivatives. ==1,2,4,5-Tetrazine== 1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are very well known and myriad 3,6-disubstituted 1,2,4,5-tetrazines are known.(see United States Patent 6645325) These materials are of use in the area of energetic chemistry. The compound 3,6-di-2-pyridyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine'Datasheet: Link has two pyridine substituents and is of importance as a reagent in Diels-Alder reactions. It reacts with norbornadiene in a sequence of one DA reaction and two retro-DA reactions to cyclopentadiene and a pyridazine with exchange of an acetylene unit:Dalk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, Erdin, and Arif Da\u015ftan. \"Synthesis of cyclopentadiene derivatives by retro-Diels\u2013Alder reaction of norbornadiene derivatives.\" Tetrahedron 71.13 (2015): 1966-1970.
