Being expressed manually, they are received visually and sometimes tactually. When it is the primary form of communication, it may be enhanced by body language and facial expressions. Manual communication is employed in sign languages and manually coded languages, though sign languages also possess non-manual elements. Other systems of manual communication have been developed for specific purposes, typically in situations where speech is not practical (such as loud environments) or permitted, or where secrecy is desired. == Examples == * Charades * Diving signals \u2014 hand communication methods while scuba diving * Flag semaphores \u2014 telegraphy systems using hand-held flags, other objects, or the hands themselves * Finger counting ** Chinese number gestures ** Open outcry hand signaling * Fingerspelling or manual alphabets * Gang signals \u2014 signs used to signify allegiance to a gang or local gang branches * Hand signals in traffic * Monastic sign languages \u2014 symbolic gestural communication used by monastic communities * Rueda de Casino \u2014 a dance that uses hand motions to \"call\" other dancers * Tic-tac \u2014 a traditional method of hand signs used by bookmakers in horse racing * U.S. Army hand and arm signals ==External links== * ASL Resource Site Free online lessons, ASL dictionary, and resources for teachers, students, and parents.
