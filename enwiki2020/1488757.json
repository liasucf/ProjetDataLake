    "text": "Portrait of Hans Asper Hans Asper (149921 March 1571) was a Swiss painter. ==Life== He lived his entire life in Zurich. Nothing is known of his life until 1526, when he married the daughter of Ludwig N\u00f6ggi, a master carpenter who sat in the city council, and his first artwork dates only from 1531. Asper was himself a citizen of some standing, and was elected to the Great Council in 1545. He painted in a variety of styles, and is particularly known for his studies of flowers and fruit. Many of his pictures are lost. His portraits show affinity to the works of Hans Holbein. Notable works include portraits of Huldrych Zwingli and Zwingli's daughter Regula Gwalter, which came into the ownership of the public library of Zurich. Asper is also believed to have provided the illustrations for Conrad Gesner's Historia Animalium. He had a medal struck in his honor, but died in poverty. Two of his eleven children, Hans Rudolf Asper and Rudolf Asper, were also painters. == Gallery == Ulrich- Zwingli-1.jpg|Huldrych Zwingli, about 1531 File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|Huldrych Zwingli, 1549 Hans Asper 001.jpg|Cleophea Holzhalb, 1538 Wilhelm Froelich.jpg|Wilhelm Fr\u00f6lich, 1549 Pietro Vermigli by Hans Asper.jpg|Pietro Martire Vermigli, 1560 File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Portr\u00e4t von Regula GwaltherZwingli und Anna Gwalther - 500000029.jpg|Regula Gwalther Zwingli and Anna Gwalther ==References== Attribution: * ==External links== * __NOTOC__ Category:1499 births Category:1571 deaths Category:People from Z\u00fcrich Category:16th-century Swiss painters Category:Swiss male painters Category:Renaissance painters ",
