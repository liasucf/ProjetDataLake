A siyum is usually followed by a celebratory meal, or seudat mitzvah, a meal in honor of a mitzvah, or commandment. Siyum also refers to the celebration. An enduring custom is for the community to complete a unit of Torah or tractate(s) of Talmud during the 30 days following the death of a beloved one and hold a communal siyum thereafter, in tribute and honor of the memory of the deceased. It has become customary for synagogues to arrange a siyum on the morning before Passover to allow those fasting for Ta\u2019anit Bechorim (Fast of the Firstborn) to break their fast, taking advantage of the halakhic principle that prioritizes Torah study. A siyum ha-sefer, meaning \u201ccompletion of the book,\u201d is also held as a ceremonial completion and dedication of a sefer Torah, a handwritten copy of the Torah, the most important Jewish ritual object, which is kept in the Ark of a synagogue. Usually, when an individual or a group conclude the study of any tractate of the Talmud, or even of the Mishnah, a siyum is celebrated. At the end of every volume of the Talmud a special hadran prayer is printed with a set order of prayers and a special kaddish, Kaddish D'itchadita, in honor of the completion of that volume, which Judaism considers to be an important achievement and a milestone worth celebrating. In the merit and honor of a deceased individual, it is customary to undertake Mishnah study with the goal of holding a siyum. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, based on the Nemukei Yosef, the Ran (Rabbeinu Nissim), the Rashbam, and the Eliyah Rabbah, extends the concept of a siyum to include even a festive meal celebrating the completion of any mitzvah (commandment) that has taken a significant duration of time (such as a number of weeks or months). ==Siyum HaShas== An event known as a Siyum HaShas marks the completion of the entire Talmud in the Daf Yomi study program, in which one daf or folioA daf, or \"blatt\" in Yiddish, consists of both sides of the page. of Talmud is completed each day. Under this program, the entire Talmud is covered every seven and a half years. The main event for the 13th Siyum HaShas took place on January 1, 2020 in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey with a sellout crowd of over 90,000. Other Siyum HaShas events were held around the world. ==See also== *Bereavement in Judaism *Fast of the firstborn *Hadran (Talmud) *Mishnah *Seudat mitzvah *Talmud ==References== ==Further reading== *Eisenberg, R.L.
