    "text": "Hypana () or Hypaneia (\u1f59\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) was a town in the interior of Triphylia in ancient Elis. It was taken by Philip V of Macedon in the Social War. Its inhabitants had been transferred to Elis when Strabo wrote. Hypana is mentioned along with Typaneae near the rivers Dalion and Acheron, tributaries of Alpheus. Both these towns must have been situated in the mountains of Triphylia. Most modern scholars identify its location with a site near the modern town of Platiana,Page of the Ministry of Culture of Greece: the acropolis of Platiana (in Greek)) though other writers disagree, and propose other locations.It has been suggested by Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres Esbarranch that Hypana is sited near a locality currently called Gryllos, which used to be called Mundritza (). ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Elis Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Triphylia ",
