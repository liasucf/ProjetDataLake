He was the fourth faculty member to be appointed, when Sol Penner founded the Engineering department in University of California, San Diego. In January 1981, he accepted the Robert H. Goddard chair at Princeton, eventually returning to UCSD in 1988. Williams also served as an adjunct Professor at Yale University for one month of each year starting in 1997 and culminating after ten years. He was also the director of Center for Energy Research from 1990 to 2006 at UCSD. He served as a department chair at UCSD for four years. ==Research== Williams' research interests includes combustion, propulsion applications, micro-gravity flames etc. He made seminal contributions to the combustion field for the past six decades and considered as one of the prominent scientist in combustion. He wrote the Williams spray equation in 1958Williams, F. A. \"Spray combustion and atomization.\" The physics of fluids 1.6 (1958): 541-545. when he was still a PhD student, as a statistical model for spray combustion analogous to Boltzmann equation. Though Activation Energy Asymptotics were known to Russian scientists forty years ago, it was Williams call in 1971 in Annual Review of Fluid MechanicsWilliams, F. A. \"Theory of combustion in laminar flows.\" Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics 3.1 (1971): 171-188. which made the western scientific community to start using the analysis.Buckmaster, John David, and Geoffrey Stuart Stephen Ludford. Theory of laminar flames. Cambridge University Press, 1982. He wrote down the G equation in 1985,Williams, F. A. \"Turbulent combustion.\" The mathematics of combustion 2 (1985): 267-294. a model for premixed turbulent flame as a wrinkled flame. The classification of Combustion instabilities was first introduced by Williams and Barr\u00e8re in 1969.Barrere, M., & Williams, F. A. (1969, January). Comparison of combustion instabilities found in various types of combustion chambers. In Symposium (International) on Combustion (Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 169-181). Elsevier. He worked on number of projects with NASA, Air force and other organizations. He is the principal investigator of the following International Space Station experiments, MDCA (Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus), FSDC (Fiber Supported Droplet Combustion), FSDC-2 (Fiber Supported Droplet Combustion - 2),https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990019814.pdf DCE (Droplet Combustion Experiment),https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990019805.pdf FLEX (Flame Extinguishment Experiment),https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/666.html FLEX-2 (Flame Extinguishment Experiment - 2),https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/480.html Cool Flames Investigation.https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1947.html He conducted lot of experiments, some of his recent experiments include spiral flames in von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n swirling flow, ethanol flames, fire spread etc. ==Publications== Williams Combustion Theory, second edition published in 1985, is still an authoritative book in the combustion field. ===Books=== * * * * * * * * ===Lecture Notes=== * ==Honors== Williams is an elected member of National Academy of Engineering (1988) and also in American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2010). He is a fellow of The Combustion Institute. He is elected as a fellow of APS in 2002. He is also a member of AIAA, SIAM etc. He holds an honorary doctorate degree from Technical University of Madrid. He has been in the editorial board of various journals, currently he is in the editorial board of Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, Combustion Science and Technology. He was a member of the National Construction Safety Team Advisory Committee in reporting the Collapse of the World Trade Center.http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/pulse/spring2003/faculty_honors.shtmlhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734904114528457 Some of his awards include: * Silver Combustion Medal (1978) from The Combustion Institute * Alexander von Humboldt U.S. Senior Scientist Award (1982) * Bernard Lewis Gold Medal (1990) from The Combustion Institute * Pendray Aerospace Literature Award (1993) from AIAA * Thermal Engineering Award for International Activity (1999) from JSME *Propellants & Combustion Award (2004) from AIAA * Distinguished Public Service Medal (2017) from NASAhttps://www.nasa.gov/specials/2017medalhonorees/#dsm A conference titled Symposium on Advancements in Combustion Theory was conducted at UCSD in 2004 in honor of Williams 70th birthday.
