He also studies the perturbation of hDlg distribution in two skin disease: psoriasis, characterized by a hyper-proliferation of basal cells, and Darier's disease, characterized by blisters resulting from the loss of cell adhesion in the supra-basal layers. He is a founding member of BioVisions. ==Lectures== In 2015, Viel started to teach an online course MCB63X - Principles of Biochemistry with Rachelle Gaudet on edX.. ==Publications== ===Books=== Viel is a co-author of the book Biology: How Life Works. It is published by Macmillan Education and is the first project to develop three pillars: the text, the visual program, and the assessment at the same time. ===Multimedia=== Viel is co-author of The Inner Life of the Cell, an 8.5-minute 3D computer graphics animation illustrating the molecular mechanisms that occur when a white blood cell in the blood vessels of the human body is activated by inflammation (Leukocyte extravasation). It shows how a white blood cell rolls along the inner surface of the capillary, flattens out, and squeezes through the cells of the capillary wall to the site of inflammation where it contributes to the immune reaction. ==References== ==External links== *Webpage at Harvard University *Northwest Teaching Laboratories *MCB63X, Principles of Biochemistry, HarvardX, edX *BioVisions** , * YouTube video * The Inner Life of the Cell - Shockwave Flash Video (without narration) * Extravasion Simplified cartoon version of the same process. * David Bolinsky's Speech Presenting The Inner Life of the Cell Category:Living people Category:Harvard University faculty Category:French scientists Category:Biochemistry educators Category:French biologists Category:Cell biology Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
