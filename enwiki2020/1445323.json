They would go on to become one of the most successful writer/producer duos in R&B; history, cultivating hit songs for contemporary luminaries, including Stephanie Mills and Kurtis Blow. Ren\u00e9 & Angela released their self-titled debut album in 1980, followed by Wall to Wall (1982), and Rise (1983), all on Capitol Records. During this period they had two moderate R&B; hit singles, \"I Love You More\" and \"My First Love\". The two stopped working professionally together in 1986. They pursued successful solo careers amid legal disputes over creative rights to their work together, and others with which they collaborated as composers, songwriters, and producers. In spite of this, both Winbush and Moore continue to enjoy substantial success in their respective solo careers, with Moore going on to compose and produce hits for many major artists, most notably Michael Jackson; and together they wrote and produced four songs for Janet Jackson's first, self-titled album. Over the course of his career, Moore has been nominated for two Grammys: one for Song of the Year, Michael Jackson's New Jack Swing-hit Jam and a second for Producer of the Album of the Year, Michael Jackson's HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. Moore released a solo album, Street Songz for Rufftown Entertainment Group, Inc. in 2004. ==A Street Called Desire == During Rene & Angela's early years, Moore and Winbush were asked to produce songs for Janet Jackson's 1982 self-titled debut album, Janet Jackson. One of the songs, \"Young Love\", became Jackson's first top ten R&B; hit reaching number six on the chart.Ebony Jun 1990 They also wrote successfully for Stephanie Mills, (their \"I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love\", gave Mills her first- ever No. 1 R&B; single, in 1985). Just prior to that, Rene & Angela decided to branch out and find a bigger fan base signing with Mercury Records in 1984. They released their breakthrough album, A Street Called Desire in early 1985. Among the hit singles included on this classic album was their first R&B; No. 1 with the dance single, \"Save Your Love (For #1)\", which included guest vocals from rapper Kurtis Blow, making it besides Chaka Khan's \"I Feel For You\", one of the first songs to prominently feature a guest rapper as a featured performer. Other hit singles included the Top 5 hit single \"I'll Be Good\"; \"Your Smile\" was another R&B; No. 1 hit while the subsequent \"You Don't Have to Cry\", hit Number Two in the beginning of 1986, followed by yet another Top 5 hit, \"No How-No Way\". Eventually A Street Called Desire sold over a million copies going platinum, but on the brink of their greatest success, tensions between Moore and Winbush had grown, and they dissolved the partnership. Moore went on to compose and produce hits most notably for, and with, Michael Jackson. ==Influence== Since starting out with Rene & Angela, Moore and Winbush have played and continue to play an influence on various R&B; and hip-hop acts.
