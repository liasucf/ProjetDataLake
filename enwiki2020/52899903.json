    "text": "The Mute's House is a 2015 Israeli documentary film directed by Tamar Kay about the Rajabi's, a single mother and her son, both Palestinians living in the Jewish quarter of the West Bank city of Hebron. The film was produced by Ariel Richter and Tamar Kay as their thesis film at The Jerusalem Sam Spiegel Film & Television School. The film was well received by critics and audiences. In October 2016, the film was listed as one of the 10 shortlisted films to compete for the 89th Academy Award's Best Documentary Short Subject. == Story == A building in Hebron, which has been deserted by its Palestinian owners, is called \u201cThe Mute's House\" by the Israeli soldiers stationed there and by the tour guides who pass by. The building's only occupants are a deaf woman, Sahar, and her eight-year-old son, Yousef. The family's unique story, which unfolds against the backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is told through the eyes of the young and charismatic Yousef, as he goes through his daily routine in both the Jewish and Muslim areas of a city torn apart by hatred and violence. == Release & Reception == The film premiered in November 2015 at IDFA, and has participated in over 20 international film festivals since. It premiered on Israel's Channel 8 on January 21, 2017. The film has received mostly positive reactions and reviews. As the film deals with the politically volatile subject of the West Bank, there has been some criticism by both right and left wing audiences regarding the representation of the city and its residents. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Awards & Nominations |- !Festival/Ceremony !Year !Award !Result |- |Krak\u00f3w Film Festival |2016 |Best Short Film |Won |- |IDFA - International Documentary Festival Amsterdam |2015 |Special Jury Award for Student Documentary |Won |- |St. Louis International Film Festival |2016 |Best Documentary Short |Won |- |Full Frame Documentary Film Festival |2016 |Best Student Film |Won |- |Docaviv- Tel Aviv International Documentary Film Festival |2016 |Best Student Film |Won |- |Jerusalem Film Festival |2016 |Best Documentary Short |Won |- |The Israeli Documentary Filmmakers Forum Awards |2016 |Best Student Film |Won |- |Early Bird International Student Film Festival |2016 |Best Documentary |Won |- |Montefeltro Film School Festival |2016 |Best Film |Won |- |International Federation of Film Societies |2016 |Best Short Film |Special Mention |- |Flickerfest International Short Film Festival |2017 |Best Documentary Short |Special Mention |- |Student Academy Awards |2016 |Best Foreign Documentary |Finalist |- |The Tel Aviv International Student Film Festival |2016 |Best Documentary Film |Finalist |- |The Ophir Awards |2016 |Best Documentary Short Subject |Nominated |} == References == * Touching doc on 'unique, amazing' Palestinian boy contends for Oscar nomination - NonFictionFilm.com - Jan 13, 2017 * 'Storm' drifts off Oscar map, but 'Mute's House' stands its ground - Jewish Journal - Dec. 21, 2016 * Oscars: 10 Doc Shorts That Go to Great Lengths - The Hollywood Reporter - Nov. 15, 2016 * 10 Documentary Shorts Vie for Nominations - IndieWire - Oct. 26, 2016 == External links == * The Mute's House Official Website * * The Mute's House Trailer on YouTube Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Israeli films Category:2015 films ",
