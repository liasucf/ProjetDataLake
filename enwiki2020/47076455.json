Naipaul. The site offers original content and aggregated news and blogs, and features opinion on politics, economics, and business issues. CapX was launched on 21 June 2014 as a commentary outlet to promote \"democratic capitalism\" and support innovation, competition, free trade, good governance and liberty. It aggregates and selects news from 3.5 million blogs, academic journals and mainstream media. It publishes a spectrum of pro-market authors. ==History== CapX was founded by the Centre for Policy Studies on 21 June 2014 in collaboration with Signal Media. On 28 January 2015 a new site was launched for CapX. Lord Saatchi, chairman of the Centre for Policy Studies, commented on its launch, \"CapX, the first global digital think tank, has been designed to show how popular capitalism can work to the benefit of all. We hope it will make a difference.\" ==Contributors== In addition to columns by Iain Martin and a group of contributors such as Tim Montgomerie, Daniel Hannan, Philippe Legrain, and Paul Collier, CapX has many authors\u2014from politicians and campaigners to academics and policy experts\u2014who contribute on a wide range of topics. Specialist contributors include Indian economist Deepak Lal and Islamic economics specialist Jeff Halevy. ==Political views== CapX is broadly on the centre-right of the political spectrum. In 2015, the then editor Iain Martin stated that CapX is \"for competition because it drives innovation, creates wealth and increases prosperity.\" CapX supports innovation, competition, free trade, facilitative government and liberty, and is opposed to cronyism, corporatism and restrictive markets. Conservative politician Paul Goodman wrote on the political website ConservativeHome in October 2014, recommending that readers should add CapX to their reading list. ==Funding== The Centre for Policy Studies has received funding for the project from the Templeton Religion Trust and the Rising Tide Foundation. ==References== ==External links== * Category:British political websites Category:Liberalism in the United Kingdom Category:British news websites Category:Internet properties established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
