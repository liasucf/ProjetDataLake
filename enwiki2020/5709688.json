    "text": "The Piolet d'Or (, French for \"Golden Ice Axe\") is an annual mountaineering award given by the French magazine Montagnes and The Groupe de Haute Montagne since 1992. Golden Ice Axes are awarded for achievements in the previous year. It is considered mountaineering's highest honor, and is considered to be the \"Oscars\" of mountaineering and climbing. Nominations are selected by GHM and Montagnes, and the award is chosen by a jury consisting of Guy Chaumereuil (the chief editor of Montagnes when the award was inaugurated), (until 1998) Jean-Claude Marmier (president of GHM when the award was inaugurated), the current president of GHM, the current editor of Montagnes, the previous year's winners and three members invited by GHM, one of whom becomes the president of the jury. The criteria for the award are as follows (translated from French): > The selection of potential laureates, as well as the conditions of awarding > the trophy obey a strict ethic, which is in line with the founding values of > the GHM. High technical level and commitment certainly constitute the > principal criteria to which the GHM members feel so attached. The > originality in the choice of the objective and the innovative nature of the > manner of conducting the ascent are equally important elements of > appreciation. The practice of alpinism is in effect in perpetual evolution, > and this dimension should not be forgotten. It's by the crossing of certain > stages that were considered impassable that mentalities have evolved, and > ascents reputed to be impossible have become commonplace\u2026 Respect for the > mountains that surround us, the beauty of movement, and the spirit in which > people climb those mountains are also primary conditions for the awarding of > the prize. We cannot in fact pass down to future generations summits > mutilated in the name of a destructive climbing style without profoundly > altering the spirit itself of this activity. 14th Piolet d'Or. URL accessed > June 25, 2006. Controversy has surrounded the award, due to the non-quantifiable nature of climbing accomplishments, and the varying interpretations of 'alpinism' and 'respect for the mountains.' Controversy has been magnified when the award recipient completed the climb in 'heavy' style, spending large amounts of time on the ascent and leaving gear behind, as in the cases of the 1997 and 2005 awards. In 2005 Ian Parnell withdrew his nomination, as did Alessandro Beltrami, Rolando Garibotti and Ermanno Salvaterra in 2006 for what might be the first ascent of the north face of Cerro Torre, and in 2008 during the selection process Garibotti asked the jury not to take into consideration the Torre Traverse first ascent he completed with Colin Haley. Marko Prezelj rejected the award in 2007 on stage to express his opposition for competition in alpinism. Marmier left the jury in 1998 explaining that \"the decision of the jury has been a real disaster.\" ==2020 award== The 2020 Piolet d'Or will be awarded in September 2020 during the Review of Mountain Films named after Andrzej Zawada in L\u0105dek-Zdr\u00f3j, Poland. *Catherine Destivelle will be presented with the 12th Lifetime Achievement award. ==2019 award== The 2019 Piolet d'Or was awarded in September 2019 during the Review of Mountain Films named after Andrzej Zawada in L\u0105dek-Zdr\u00f3j, Poland.
