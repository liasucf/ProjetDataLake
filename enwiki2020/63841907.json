    "text": "Kandice Tanner is a Trinidad and Tobago biophysicist researching the metastatic traits that allow tumor cells to colonize secondary organs. She is a Stadtman principal investigator at the National Cancer Institute, where she is head of the tissue morphodynamics unit. == Education == Kandice Tanner attended an all girls school in Trinidad before becoming one of the only female students at a school of 1,200 people. She intended on attending the University of the West Indies where she had already been accepted before receiving a full scholarship at the South Carolina State University. In 2002, Tanner completed a dual bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and physics, summa cum laude. In 2006, she completed a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign under advisor . Her doctoral research entailed mapping functional specialization in mammalian brains. Tanner's dissertation was titled \"Cat\"-ology: spectrally resolved neurophotonics in the mammalian brain and phantom studies. She conducted post- doctoral training at the University of California, Irvine specializing in dynamic imaging of thick tissues. She then became a Department of Defense Breast Cancer Post-doctoral fellow jointly at University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under Mina Bissell. == Career == Tanner in her laboratory Tanner joined the National Cancer Institute as a Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in July, 2012, where she integrates concepts from molecular biophysics and cell biology to learn how cells and tissues sense and respond to their physical microenvironment, and to thereby design therapeutics and cellular biotechnology. Tanner is a principal investigator in the laboratory of cell biology serving as head of the tissue morphodynamics unit. === Research === Tanner's expertise includes multimodal imaging platforms, 3D cell culture, biophysics, mechanobiology, and breast cancer. Her laboratory focuses on understanding the metastatic traits that allow tumor cells to colonize secondary organs. Her team team includes physicists, engineers, and cancer biologists. They have determined that cells can switch between different types of motility namely rotation, random and amoeboid when placed in 3D biomimetic platforms. Tanner's lab has linked the type of motility to the establishment of distinct multicellular architectures and tissue polarity. Additionally, they use optical microscopy to uncover in vivo mechanisms of metastasis using zebrafish as an animal model. The laboratory studies are focused on understanding how physical cues from the tissue microenvironment drive organ specific metastasis. == Awards and honors == Tanner was awarded the 2013 National Cancer Institute Director's Intramural Innovation Award, the 2015 NCI Leading Diversity award, Federal Technology Transfer Award in 2016 and 2018, the 2016 Young Fluorescence Investigator award from the Biophysical Society, and named as a Young Innovator in Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering in 2016 by the Biomedical Engineering Society. In 2020, Tanner was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society. == Selected works == * * * == References == ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st- century women scientists Category:Women medical researchers Category:Trinidad and Tobago emigrants to the United States Category:Trinidad and Tobago people of African descent Category:Trinidad and Tobago women scientists Category:Trinidad and Tobago academics Category:Trinidad and Tobago biologists Category:Trinidad and Tobago medical researchers Category:South Carolina State University alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni Category:Cancer researchers Category:Women biophysicists Category:21st-century biologists Category:21st-century physicists Category:Biophysicists Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ",
