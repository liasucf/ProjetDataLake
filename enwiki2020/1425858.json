The Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA) is a member- owned, non-profit organization, which provides research, education and certification services to organic growers, processors and handlers around the world. OCIA certifies and verifies farm, livestock, processor/handlers, broker-traders, Community Grower Groups (CGGs), and Private Labels to various programs. OCIA certifies operations to the OCIA International Certification Standard, USDA National Organic Program (NOP), Canada Organic Regime (COR), European Union Equivalent Standards (EU), Japanese Organic Agricultural Standards (JAS) and Quebec Organic Reference Standards (Quebec). OCIA verifies to JAS, the US-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement, Bio Suisse, Swiss Ordinance of Organic Farming, UTZ Certified, Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Shade-Grown Coffee (part of the OCIA International Certification Standard.) Bilingual organic certification seal.With its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, OCIA has regional and chapter offices in Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, Japan, Guatemala, Peru and the U.S. OCIA was founded in 1985 (incorporated in Pennsylvania 1988) near Sherbrooke, Quebec, by a group of farmers, modeled on the \"crop improvement associations\" that came out of the Dust Bowl era. These associations started as informal meetings where farmers could discuss and ask advice about their land. In the 1970s as the organic movement developed, \"organic\" crop improvement associations were formed. OCIA mandated that farmers would hold farmers to one of the first international organic standards in 1985. An international organization, OCIA continues to have a local approach with the organization largely being made up of local \"chapters.\" The organization had members primarily in Canada and the U.S. until a group of Peruvian farmers joined the organization in 1988. Expansion throughout Latin America continued, and now OCIA has members across the world. ==Controversies== ===Certification company spin offs=== OCIA grew the organic industry as new organic certification companies split off since its founding, including Global Organic Alliance, OneCert, TransCanada Organic Certification Services, and Quality Assurance International. ===Suspension in China=== OCIA was suspended from operating in China in 2010 for one year by the USDA after it reportedly used employees of a Chinese government agency to inspect state- controlled farms and food processing facilities, which constituted a conflict of interest. In China, OCIA had joined forces with the Organic Food Development Corporation, an agency affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. The association kept a small staff \u2014 one or three people in Nanjing \u2014 while inspectors from the Chinese agency went out to farms and factories. Their findings were translated into English and sent to OCIA headquarters in Nebraska, where staff members reviewed the material and made the final decisions on certification. ==External links== * Organic Crop Improvement Association ==Notes and references== Category:Organic farming organizations Category:Organic farming in the United States Category:Product certification Category:Agriculture in Nebraska Category:Organizations based in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:Non-profit organizations based in Nebraska Category:Environmental organizations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Nebraska Category:Agricultural organizations based in the United States ",
