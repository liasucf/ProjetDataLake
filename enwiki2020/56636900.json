Nothing is mellowed down, and there crude criminals and officers are shown as is. P Ravi Shankar steals the show as the ghastly cop on a mission to make these heartless criminals confess to their crimes. Pooja Gandhi in her uninhibited avatar is another person who deserves applause. Makarand Deshpande evokes fear, while the rest of the cast stay true to their parts.\"https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/kannada/movie- reviews/dandupalya-3/movie-review/63329338.cms The writer of Chtraloka, rated 3.5/5 and stated \"Terrifying account of Dandupalya crimeIII, part three of the film on the Dandupalya gang's crime is a terrifying account of the ways and Director Srinivas Raju has made a film that will shock and scare people about how this gang was captured and brought to book.\" The writer of Cinema Express, rated 3/5 and stated that \"Pooja Gandhi wins over the audience with her powerful performance, while Makarand Deshpande gets deep into the character's skin. Ravi Shankar is an all-rounder and makes no mistakes in getting into the police avatar. Shruthi, Kari Subbu, Ravi Kale, and Danny are all well chosen for their roles and do justice to them.

The cinematography and editing are top class. The stylish presentation, however, does not cover the intent; to shock and awe. Expletives, ample display of cleavage, graphic murders and rapes do the trick. If that excites you, III is for you.\"http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/reviews/entertainment/reviews/iii- movie-review-repugnant-and-lewd/articleshow/63337007.cms The writer Sharadha of New Indian Express, rated 3/5 and stated that \"Pooja Gandhi wins over the audience with her powerful performance, while Makarand Deshpande gets deep into the character's skin.
