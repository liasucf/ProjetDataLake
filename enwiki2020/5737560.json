By 1930, the present-day route was an unpaved road between US 209 in Brodheadsville and McMichaels and a paved road between McMichaels and US 611 in Tannersville. The road between US 611 in Tannersville and PA 90 (now PA 191) in Henryville existed as a paved road by 1940. In the 1940s, the road between Brodheadsville and McMichaels was paved. PA 715 was designated on April 8, 1963 to follow its current alignment between US 209 in Brodheadsville and PA 191 in Henryville. PA 715 was signed in order to provide a route number at the I-80 interchange in Tannersville. ==Major intersections== ==PA 715 Truck== Pennsylvania Route 715 Truck is a truck route of PA 715 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over the Pocono Creek in Pocono Township, on which trucks over 21 tons and combination loads over 25 tons are prohibited.
