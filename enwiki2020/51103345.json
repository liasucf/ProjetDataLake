    "text": "Let There Be Light (stylised as let there be light.) is the 25th live album of Hillsong Worship, which consists of several worship pastors from Australian church Hillsong Church. The album was recorded during the 2016 Hillsong Conference at the Qudos Bank Arena from 4 July until 7 July 2016 and was released on 14 October 2016, under Hillsong Music, Sparrow Records and Capitol Christian Music Group. Their music captures the heart and sound of Hillsong Church globally and represents the coming together of the Hillsong worship team from around the world; including Reuben Morgan, Marty Sampson, Joel Houston, Brooke Ligertwood, Ben Fielding, Taya Smith, Dave Ware, Annie Garratt and many more. == Background == In March 2016, \"Grace to Grace\" was released and served as a single for Easter. In July worship leader Ben Fielding said, \"We've been intentional about writing songs that will translate across the Church globally.\" From many of the Hillsong global campuses such as Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, songs were written, re-written and collaborated on in the lead up to the album recording. \"The collaborations have been more through relationship this year, and it has felt less segmented. We've been writing in the studio and there would be people from three different campuses in three different countries there. Each would be representing their own congregation's unique sound, but working together to create something that will translate for all campuses.\" The title of the album is a reference to Genesis 1:3. == Theme == Rich Langton, who oversees the pastoral care of the creative team in Australia, said, \"Jesus is the light of the world and we carry that too.\" == Awards and accolades == On 9 August 2017, it was announced that Let There Be Light would be nominated for a GMA Dove Award in the Worship Album of the Year and the Long Form Video of the Year categories at the 48th Annual GMA Dove Awards. In addition to the album's nomination, the song \"What a Beautiful Name\" was nominated for a GMA Dove Award in the Song of the Year and Worship Song of the Year categories. On 17 October 2017, \"What a Beautiful Name\" won both GMA Dove Awards for Song of the Year and the Worship Song of the Year at a ceremony held at the Allen Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, with composers Brooke Ligertwood and Ben Fielding receiving the awards. == Track listing == ;Notes * \"Behold (Then Sings My Soul)\" is inspired by \u201cHow Great Thou Art\u201d, courtesy of The Stuart Hine Trust.https://d9nqqwcssctr8.cloudfront.net/wp- content/uploads/2016/10/07001539/Behold-Then-Sings-My-Soul_LCC.pdf * \"I Will Boast in Christ\" contains additional lyrics from \"Nothing but the Blood\", traditional. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 85 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Albums (Billboard) | 9 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Albums (Billboard) | 17 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Albums (Billboard) | 23 |} ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Zendesk and AllMusic.
