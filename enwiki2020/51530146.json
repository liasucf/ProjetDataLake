    "text": "Daniel Ant\u00f3nio Lopes Ramos (born 25 December 1970) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a midfielder, and manager of C.D. Santa Clara. ==Football career== Born in Vila do Conde, Ramos' professional input during his nine-year senior career consisted in nine Segunda Liga games, with Rio Ave FC (six) and S.C. Beira-Mar (three). He retired in June 1998, at the age of only 27. Ramos started working as a coach with his last club Vilanovense FC, in 2001. In the following years he alternated between the second and third divisions, his first job at the professional level being with G.D. Chaves in the 2004\u201305 campaign. In early 2014, Ramos was appointed at division three club F.C. Famalic\u00e3o, achieving promotion in his first full season and leaving on 17 May 2016. Shortly after, he signed a one-year deal with C.D. Santa Clara also in the second tier. On 22 September 2016, after six wins and one draw in the first seven games, Ramos left the Azores side and joined C.S. Mar\u00edtimo in the Primeira Liga, then ranking second from bottom in the table. He eventually led his team to the sixth place, with the subsequent qualification to the UEFA Europa League. With a year left on his Mar\u00edtimo contract, Ramos moved back to Chaves in June 2018 for a fee of around \u20ac100,000 after their loss of Lu\u00eds Castro to Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es. He resigned by mutual consent on 10 December, with the team in last place. At the start of 2019, Ramos was hired by Rio Ave for the rest of the season after Jos\u00e9 Gomes moved to Reading. After he guided them to seventh place, both parties agreed not to renew. On 18 December 2019, Ramos was appointed at Boavista F.C. for the second half of the campaign; the Porto-based club had sacked Lito Vidigal when eighth in the league. At the end of the season he returned to Santa Clara, replacing Jo\u00e3o Henriques on a one- year deal. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Nat !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=8|Record |- ! ! ! ! ! |- | Vilanovense | | 21 October 2001 | 4 June 2002 |- | Drag\u00f5es Sandinenses | | 4 June 2002 | 25 April 2004 |- | Chaves | | 15 May 2004 | 28 November 2004 |- | Trofense | | 1 July 2005 | 21 May 2007 |- | Moreirense | | 14 November 2007 | 17 June 2008 |- | Gondomar | | 18 June 2008 | 31 May 2009 |- | Vizela | | 6 July 2009 | 8 February 2010 |- | Trofense | | 9 February 2010 | 12 May 2010 |- | Uni\u00e3o Madeira | | 1 July 2010 | 13 June 2011 |- | Naval | | 14 June 2011 | 3 April 2012 |- | Ribeir\u00e3o | | 12 November 2012 | 26 August 2013 |- | Famalic\u00e3o | | 26 February 2014 | 17 May 2016 |- | Santa Clara | | 3 June 2016 | 22 September 2016 |- | Mar\u00edtimo | | 22 September 2016 | 6 June 2018 |- | Chaves | | 6 June 2018 | 10 December 2018 |- | Rio Ave | | 3 January 2019 | 23 May 2019 |- | Boavista | | 18 December 2019 | 28 July 2020 |- | Santa Clara | | 28 July 2020 | Present |- ! colspan=4|Career totals |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vila do Conde Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:Rio Ave F.C. players Category:F.C.
