    "text": "Don't Turn Me from Your Door, subtitled John Lee Hooker Sings His Blues, is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker, compiling six songs originally recorded for De Luxe Records in 1953 along with six new tunes recorded in 1961. Atco Records released the album in 1963. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Steve Leggett stated: \"you really can't go wrong with this guyhe always delivered what he was supposed to deliver with no frills and no fuss, generating a kind of endless boogie that, no matter what embellishments producers added in, was always poised between old country blues and its next- generation urban blues counterpart. None of Hooker's signature songs are here, but one still gets a solid sense of him, and truthfully, the only bad Hooker is no Hooker at all\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"Stuttering Blues\" \u2013 2:13 # \"Wobbling Baby\" \u2013 2:32 # \"You Lost a Good Man\" \u2013 2:50 # \"Love My Baby\" \u2013 2:35 # \"Misbelieving Baby\" \u2013 2:30 # \"Drifting Blues\" \u2013 3:33 # \"Don't Turn Me from Your Door\" \u2013 2:40 # \"My Baby Don't Love Me\" \u2013 2:58 # \"I Ain't Got Nobody\" \u2013 2:28 # \"Real Real Gone\" \u2013 2:22 # \"Guitar Lovin' Man\" \u2013 2:38 # \"Talk About Your Baby\" \u2013 2:33 Recorded in Cincinnati, Ohio in July, 1953 (tracks 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 & 11) and Miami, Florida in July, 1961 (tracks 3, 5-7, 9 & 12) ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Eddie Kirkland \u2013 guitar (track 2) *Earl Hooker \u2013 guitar (tracks 5 & 9) ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:1963 albums Category:Atco Records albums ",
