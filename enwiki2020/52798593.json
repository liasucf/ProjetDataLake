    "text": "The Battle of Milazzo was a naval battle fought in 888 between the Byzantine and Aghlabid fleets off northeastern Sicily. The battle was a major Aghlabid victory. It is sometimes known as the Second Battle of Milazzo, counting the Battle of Stelai as the First Battle of Milazzo. ==Battle== In 888, the Aghlabids mounted a new expedition aimed at Byzantine Calabria, with ships from Sicily as well as Ifriqiya. Off Milazzo, the fleet met a Byzantine squadron of the Imperial Fleet of Constantinople. The ensuing battle is not mentioned by any Byzantine source, but only by Ibn Idhari's al-Bayan al- Mughrib as well as the Cambridge Chronicle. Both agree that it was a crushing Aghlabid victory\u2014their first in open sea combat: reportedly 5,000 Byzantines drowned, and 7,000 in total (or 7,000 more, depending on the translation from the Arabic) were killed. ==Aftermath== In the aftermath of this debacle, the Byzantines abandoned many strongholds they had held in the Val Demone, and the remainder, left without hope of Byzantine aid, concluded a truce with the Aghlabid governor of Sicily. Even the garrison and populace of Rhegion are said to have temporarily abandoned their city for fear of Aghlabid attacks. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:888 Category:880s in the Byzantine Empire Milazzo Category:Milazzo Milazzo Milazzo Milazzo Category:Byzantine Sicily ",
