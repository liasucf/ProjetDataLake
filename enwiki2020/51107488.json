In 1760, she became acquainted with Giacomo Casanova, who made her a horoscope claiming that she would be the lover of the king. Her sister Marie-Madeleine Couppier-Varnier was a courtesan in Paris and connected to Dominique Guillaume Lebel, who provided the king with lovers for his Parc- aux-Cerfs. ===Royal mistress=== She became the petite ma\u00eetresse (unofficial mistress) of the King in 1760, but she refused to become one of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, were at the time Marguerite-Catherine Haynault and Lucie Madeleine d'Estaing were housed. Instead, she successfully demanded to be given her own house in Passy, close to the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette, where the King visited her. Her house was called Hotel de la Folie. The King gave her the title baronesse de Meilly-Coulonge. She had a son with the King: Louis Aim\u00e9 de Bourbon (1761-1787), who became a priest. The King registered himself as the father of the child, which was unusual, as while he did take responsibility for many of his illegitimate children, he normally did not acknowledge them. Anne Couppier de Romans called her son 'Monseigneur', a title for a Prince, and displayed him in public in the Bois de Boulogne. The special treatment given by the king to Anne Couppier de Romans, so unlike anything to any of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, reportedly worried Madame de Pompadour, and on one occasion, she visited the Bois de Boulogne to observe Anne Couppier de Romans and her son. ===Later life=== In 1765, Anne Couppier de Romans was implicated in the affair of Louis-Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais. The same year, the king discontinued their affair. She was separated from her son. She was given an allowance of 500.000 livres, more than any of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs. In 1772, she married Gabriel Guillaume de Siran, marquis de Cavanac (d. 1784). In contrast to most of the marriages of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, hers was not arranged by the king. She had two children in her marriage prior to her separation. She left France during the French Revolution and lived in Spain during the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, she returned to France and reclaimed her property.
