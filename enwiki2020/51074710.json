The establishment bills itself as \"the first cat cafe and adoption center in the Pacific Northwest\". ==Description and history== Purringtons opened on January 24, 2015 at 3529 Northeast Martin Luther King Blvd. in the Boise neighborhood. More than 300 people attended its opening. The business is owned by Kristen and Sergio Castillo. Kristen was inspired to create Purringtons in October 2013, after seeing her friend share a video from Le Caf\u00e9 des Chats in Paris. The business has partnered with the Sherwood-based rescue organization Cat Adoption Team (CAT) to facilitate cat adoptions. The cafe was expected to close in November 2018. However, ownership transferred to Garrett Simpson and Helen Harris in January 2019. The reopening date has not been announced. After being closed for nine months and undergoing a renovation, Purringtons reopened in February 2020. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Oregon Category:Animal welfare Category:Boise, Portland, Oregon Category:Caf\u00e9s Category:Cats ",
