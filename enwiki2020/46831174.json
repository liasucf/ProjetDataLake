    "text": "Oberon-class submarine underway in 1989 The Oberon class was a ship class of 27 British-designed submarines operated by five different nations. They were designed as a direct follow-on from the Porpoise-class: physical dimensions were the same, but stronger materials were used in hull construction, and updated equipment was fitted. The submarines were built between 1957 and 1978 by four shipyards: Cammell Laird (4), Chatham Dockyard (6), Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (11) and Vickers-Armstrongs (6). Thirteen of the submarines were operated by the Royal Navy, six by the Royal Australian Navy, three by the Brazilian Navy, three by the Royal Canadian Navy/Canadian Forces Maritime Command (plus two ex-Royal Navy boats later acquired for non- commissioned roles), and two by the Chilean Navy. The Oberons operated during the height of the Cold War, with duties including surveillance, tracking of other ships and submarines, delivery and retrieval of special forces personnel, and serving as targets for anti-submarine training. Submarines of the class were in service until 2000. As of 2015, eight of the submarines are preserved intact as museum vessels, another three are partially preserved (with some exterior portions of the submarine on display), and one is in private ownership and awaiting conversion for display. The rest have been sold for scrap, including one former museum vessel. {| class=\"wikitable sortable nowraplinks\" |+ |- !Nation !Name !Pennant !Builder ! data-sort-type=\"date\" | Laid down ! data-sort-type=\"date\" | Launched ! data-sort-type=\"date\" | Commissioned ! data-sort-type=\"date\" | Decommissioned !Status/Fate !Notes |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Oberon| |S09 |Chatham Dockyard |28 November 1957 |18 July 1959 |24 February 1961 |1986 |Sold for scrap in 1991 |Lead ship of class |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Ocelot| |S17 |Chatham Dockyard |17 November 1960 |5 May 1962 |31 January 1964 |August 1991 |Preserved since 1992 at Chatham Historic Dockyard | |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Odin| |S10 |Cammell Laird |27 April 1959 |4 November 1960 |3 May 1962 |18 October 1990 |Sold for scrap in 1991 | |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Olympus| |S12 |Vickers-Armstrongs |4 March 1960 |14 June 1961 |7 July 1962 |1980s |Sold for scrap in 2011 |Operated by Canada from 1989 to the 1990s as a non- commissioned training vessel. |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Onslaught| |S14 |Chatham Dockyard |8 April 1959 |24 September 1960 |14 August 1962 |1990 |Sold for scrap | |- |United Kingdom |data-sort-value=Onyx| |S21 |Cammell Laird |16 November 1964 |18 August 1966 |20 November 1967 |1991 |Sold for scrap in 2014 |A previous Oberon named Onyx became the Canadian during construction: this submarine was ordered as a replacement.
