    "text": "The Macau national football team (; ) represents the Chinese special administrative region of Macau in international association football. The team is supervised by the Macau Football Association (; Portuguese: Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Futebol de Macau). The Macau football team has a ranking that is one of the lowest among the FIFA members. Although usually known as simply Macau, the EAFF refers to the team as Macau, China. The national team has never qualified for the AFC Asian Cup or EAFF East Asian Championship. The team qualified for the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup, where they got one draw and two losses. The team had been representing Macau in international football events before 1999 when Macau was a dependent territory of Portugal. It continues to represent Macau even after Macau was handed over to the People's Republic of China by Portugal and became a special administrative region of China in 1999. This team is separate from the China national football team, as the Basic Law and the principle of \"one country, two systems\" allows Macau to maintain its own representative teams in international sports competitions. In Macau, the Macau football team is colloquially referred to as the \"Macau team\" (), while the Chinese national team is referred to as the \"national team\" (). == FIFA suspension == In 2005 Macau was temporarily barred by the FIFA to enter any international matches because of alleged undue influence of the government in forming the committee of its football association. The suspension was subsequently lifted after rectification by Macau. == Competition records == ===World Cup record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|FIFA World Cup !width=1% rowspan=39| !colspan=6|FIFA World Cup qualification |- !Year !Result !Position ! ! !* ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1994||colspan=8 rowspan=8|Did not qualify |6||0||0||6||1||46 |- | 1998 |6||1||1||4||3||28 |- | 2002 |6||0||0||6||2||31 |- | 2006 |2||0||0||2||1||6 |- | 2010 |2||0||0||2||2||13 |- | 2014 |2||0||0||2||1||13 |- | 2018 |2||0||1||1||1||4 |- | 2022 |2||1||0||1||1||3 |- | 2026||colspan=8|To be determined |colspan=8|To be determined |- !Total||\u2013||0/22||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 !28||2||2||24||12||144 |} ===AFC Asian Cup record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|AFC Asian Cup !width=1% rowspan=39| !colspan=6|AFC Asian Cup qualification |- !Year !Result !Position !GP !W !D !L !GS !GA !GP !W !D !L !GS !GA |- |1956 ||colspan=8 rowspan=6| Did not enter |colspan=8 rowspan=6|Did not enter |- |1960 |- |1964 |- | 1968 |- | 1972 |- | 1976 |- | 1980 ||colspan=8 rowspan=1| Did not qualify ||3||1||0||2||4||7 |- | 1984 ||colspan=8 rowspan=2| Did not enter |colspan=8 rowspan=2| Did not enter |- | 1988 |- | 1992 ||colspan=8 rowspan=9| Did not qualify |3||1||1||1||4||4 |- | 1996 |3||1||0||2||7||12 |- | 2000 |3||1||0||2||1||4 |- | 2004 |2||0||0||2||0||5 |- | 2007 |colspan=8 rowspan=1| AFC Challenge Cup |- | 2011 |colspan=8 rowspan=1| AFC Challenge Cup |- | 2015 |colspan=8 rowspan=1| AFC Challenge Cup |- | 2019 |8||0||1||7||5||20 |- | 2023 |2||1||0||1||1||3 |- !Total||0/18|| \u2013||\u2013 ||\u2013 ||\u2013 ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 !24 ||5 ||2 ||17 ||22 || 55 |} ===Asian Games=== :Football at the Asian Games has been an under-23 tournament since 2002. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|Asian Games Record |- !Year !Result !GP !W !D* !L !GS !GA |- | 1951||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1954||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1958||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1962||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1966||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1970||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1974||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1978||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1982||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1986||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1990||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1994||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1998||-||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2002\u2013present |colspan=8|See Macau national under-23 football team |- |Total||0/0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |} === East Asian Cup record === * 2003 \u2013 Did not qualify (3rd place in Preliminary) * 2005 \u2013 Did not enter * 2008 \u2013 Did not qualify (4th place in Preliminary) * 2010 \u2013 Did not qualify (3rd place in Preliminary) * 2013 \u2013 Did not qualify (2nd place in Preliminary) * 2015 \u2013 Did not qualify (2nd place in Preliminary) * 2017 \u2013 Did not qualify (3rd place in Preliminary) === AFC Challenge Cup record === * 2006 \u2013 Round 1 * 2008 to 2014 \u2013 Did not qualify === AFC Solidarity Cup record === * 2016 \u2013 Runner-up == Recent results and fixtures == ===2019=== == Players == === Current squad === The following 23 players have been selected to the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC First Round qualifiers against Sri Lanka on 6 June 2019 and 11 June 2019.
