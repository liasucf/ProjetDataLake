    "text": "In linguistics, polarity of gender is when a lexical item takes the opposite grammatical gender than expected. The phenomenon is widespread in Afroasiatic languages such as Semitic and Cushitic tongues. For example, in Somali, which is a Cushitic language, plural nouns usually take the opposite gender of their singular forms. Hebrew, a Semitic language, had a consistent polarity-of- gender agreement between nouns and numerals. The phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"chiastic concord\" or \"reverse agreement\". For example, in the Hebrew noun phrase \u2018\u00e9ser ban\u00f3t, which means \"ten girls\", the numeral (ten) is masculine whereas the noun (girls) is feminine. Similarly, in the Hebrew noun phrase \u2018asar-\u00e1 ban\u00edm, which means \"ten boys\", the numeral (ten) is feminine whereas the noun (boys) is masculine. In the latter, the feminine suffix -a () is added to the numeral \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 (ten) that modifies the masculine noun (boys). However, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, common usage in modern Hebrew is different in this regard. Following Yiddish (where there is no difference between a numeral modifying a masculine noun and a numeral modifying a feminine one), in most Israeli idiolects, sociolects and dialects, the numeral-noun agreement system is much simpler, and does not follow polarity of gender. In common usage (as opposed to the prescribed form by the Academy of the Hebrew Language), the expressions \u00e9ser ban\u00f3t (\"ten girls\"), and \u00e9ser ban\u00edm (\"ten boys\"), are both commonly used and grammatical. However, argues Zuckermann, due to massive puristic pressure, Israelis end up with hypercorrect forms such as shl\u00f3sh-et ha-d\u00f3d-ot (\"the three aunts\"), as opposed to the puristic shl\u00f3sh ha-dod-\u00f3t. ==References== Category:Linguistic morphology ",
