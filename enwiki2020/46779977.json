Retrieved 23 May 2015. The fl\u00e8che is similar in plan to other defensive works like the ravelin or demi-lune, but smaller and built in front of the glacis. It was thus part of the outworks of a fortress. It was usually placed in front of the point of a bastion in order to create an additional level of fire. ==See also== * Fl\u00e8che == References == ==Literature== * Horst Wolfgang B\u00f6hme, Reinhard Friedrich, Barbara Schock- Werner (eds.): W\u00f6rterbuch der Burgen, Schl\u00f6sser und Festungen.
