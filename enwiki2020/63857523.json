At first, there was concern that he was kidnapped during a shooting attack in Tel Aviv, but that concern was lifted out after the terrorist was captured. Inspector Avraham Avraham, is the officer in charge of investigating the boy's absence case. Ze'evi Avni, Ofer's neighbor, reports in a false anonymous conversation to police that Ofer's body is near \"The Tears Square.\" In addition, it is revealed that Avni forged a letter allegedly written by Ofer and addressed to his parents regarding his absence. At the same time as the investigation is ongoing, comes a police from Belgium as part of a police exchange program. Belgian police officer named Marianka is attached to Avraham. Ze'ev Avni is invited to interogation and admits to having fabricated the letter on behalf of Ofer and lied about the anonymous call to the police, and that he does know where is Ofer. Ofer's parents did not report to the police about the phone call regarding Ofer's fate, leading the investigators to suspect his parents and arrest Ofer's father. In his interrogation, the father says that he saw Ofer sexually assault his sister Danit, and while trying to prevent him from continuing his actions he accidentally killed him. The father says he took his body to the ship and threw it into the sea. Investigators learned from the mother's interogation that in fact Ofer had seen how Danit was sexually abused by the father. Avraham is also investigating the placing of a decoy bomb near a kindergarten in Holon. He is starting to investigate a suspect who was arrested at the scene but Avraham is forced to release him for lack of evidences. He is also investigating a crane contractor named Haim Sara, which an horticulturist helper say that he has a loud argument with the horticulturist. Sarah's behavior and responses, which also say that his Thai wife went to Thailand for her family visit, cause Abraham to regard him as the prime suspect in placing the bomb. When the kindergarten teacher is brutally attacked and testifies to the identity of the attacker, the suspicion is removed from Haim Sara and he plans to take his two young children on a flight to Thailand to visit their mother. However, Abraham's early investigations into Haim Sara finds that his wife did not enter the borders of Thailand, and his concern for Sarah's children (after the trauma he experienced in the investigation of Ofer Sharabi's murder), make him insist on not letting Sarah go until his investigation is complete. == Cast == *Avraham (Avi) Avraham (Maurice Cohen): 38, single, introvert, and investigator at the Holon Police Department.
