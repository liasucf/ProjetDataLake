    "text": "Jean-Toussaint Desanti (8 October 1914 - 20 January 2002) was a French educator and philosopher known for his work on both the philosophy of mathematics and phenomenology. ==Biography== The son of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Desanti and Marie-Paule Colonna, he was born in Ajaccio and studied the philosophy of mathematics with Jean Cavaill\u00e8s. During World War II, he was a member of the French Resistance, associating with Jean-Paul Sartre and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. He joined the French Communist Party in 1943 with his wife Dominique, remaining a member until 1956. In 1950 he participated in the publication of Science bourgeoise et science proletarienne with Raymond Guyot, Francis Cohen and G\u00e9rard Vassails. This book was part of a campaign by the French Communist Party to advocate support for Lysenkoism. Also in 1956, he published his Introduction \u00e0 l'histoire de la philosophie. Desanti taught philosophy at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal, at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Saint-Cloud and at the Sorbonne. His students included Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser. In 1968, he published Les Id\u00e9alit\u00e9s math\u00e9matiques, recherches \u00e9pist\u00e9mologiques sur le d\u00e9veloppement de la th\u00e9orie des fonctions de variables r\u00e9elles. According to Etienne Balibar, Desanti's originality is to be found in his choice to set aside the traditional problems of the criteria or the status of mathematical truth, whether in their Platonic (characterized by the demarcation between the certitude proper to ideal objects and the incertitude of sensible objects) or transcendental (characterized by the definition of the a priori forms of consciousness) forms, in order to attend to another question, that of the \"mediations\" according to which a \"naive\" or elementary mathematical theory comes to open itself towards its own generalization and consequent re-foundation in more abstract terms. He died less than three weeks after undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in early 2002 in Paris. == Selected works == * Les Id\u00e9alit\u00e9s math\u00e9matiques.
