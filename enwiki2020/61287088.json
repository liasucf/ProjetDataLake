    "text": "The next Murcian regional election will be held no later than Sunday, 28 May 2023, to elect the 11th Regional Assembly of the autonomous community of the Region of Murcia. All 45 seats in the Regional Assembly will be up for election. ==Overview== ===Electoral system=== The Regional Assembly of Murcia is the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Murcia, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Murcian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting for the Regional Assembly is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in the Region of Murcia and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Murcians abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). The 45 members of the Regional Assembly of Murcia are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of three percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution. ===Election date=== The term of the Regional Assembly of Murcia expires four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Regional Assembly are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, setting the election date for the Regional Assembly on Sunday, 23 May 2023. The president has the prerogative to dissolve the Regional Assembly of Murcia and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements are met: namely, that dissolution does not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution under this procedure. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Regional Assembly shall be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances will not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remains of their four-year terms. ==Parliamentary status== The table below shows the status of the different parliamentary groups in the Regional Assembly at the present time. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%; text-align:left;\" |+ Current parliamentary composition |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"100\"| Groups ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Parties ! colspan=\"2\"| Legislators |- !

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electorate in the Region of Murcia, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which will likely contest the election: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:1.35em; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Candidacy ! rowspan=\"2\"| Parties and alliances ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Leading candidate ! rowspan=\"2\"| Ideology ! colspan=\"2\"| Previous result ! rowspan=\"2\"| |- !

Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage- point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 23 seats are required for an absolute majority in the Regional Assembly of Murcia. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\" |- style=\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! style=\"width:250px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\"width:125px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Fieldwork date ! style=\"width:50px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sample size ! style=\"width:45px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Turnout ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PSOE ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PP ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Cs ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Vox ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Podemos ! style=\"width:35px;\"| MCC ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=Somos Regi\u00f3n ! style=\"width:35px;\"| IU\u2013V\u2013RM ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=Unidas Podemos ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds ! style=\"width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Lead |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| |- | Murcia Electoral | 29 Jul\u20135 Aug 2020 | 1,841 |? | 31.4 | | 33.9 | 9.6 | 10.9 | 5.1 | 2.3 | 2.2 | 0.4 | \u2013 | 1.9 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.5 |- | Murcia Electoral | 2\u20139 Jun 2020 | 1,721 |? | 29.6 | | 34.1 | 9.2 | 11.8 | 5.7 | 2.2 | 2.5 | 0.3 | \u2013 | 2.2 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.5 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 1 Apr\u201315 May 2020 |? |? | 33.6 | | 38.5 | 6.5 | 11.4 | 4.3 | 1.7 | 1.7 | 0.9 | \u2013 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.9 |- | CEMOP | 20\u201329 Apr 2020 | 804 | 64.2 | 31.0 | | 38.8 | 7.9 | 11.8 | | \u2013 | \u2013 | | 5.5 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 7.8 |- | SyM Consulting | 30\u201331 Mar 2020 | 1,089 | 60.6 | 30.6 | | 33.8 | 8.7 | 14.8 | 3.4 | 2.6 | 2.3 | 1.5 | \u2013 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 3.2 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 6\u20138 Dec 2019 |? |? | | 26.0 | 25.4 | 7.8 | 24.3 | 6.6 | 2.9 | 2.8 | 1.7 | \u2013 | 1.0 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 0.6 |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | November 2019 general election | 10 Nov 2019 | | 68.0 | 24.8 | 26.5 | 7.4 | | 28.0 | | \u2013 | 0.3 | | 8.9 | 1.9 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 1.5 |- | Sigma Dos/La Verdad | 9\u201310 Jul 2019 | 600 |? | | 35.4 | 31.2 | 9.6 | 11.9 | 5.3 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.2 |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | 2019 regional election | 26 May 2019 | | 62.3 | | 32.5 | 32.4 | 12.0 | 9.5 | 5.6 | 2.2 | 2.0 | 2.0 | \u2013 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 0.1 |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |} ==Notes== ==References== ;Opinion poll sources ;Other Murcia 2020s ",
