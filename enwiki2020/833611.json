    "text": "Thomas Frederick Peart, Baron Peart, PC (30 April 1914 \u2013 26 August 1988) was a British Labour politician who served in the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s and was a candidate for Deputy Leader of the Party. ==Early life and education== The son of Emerson Featherstone Peart, a headmaster and leading Labour member of Durham County Council, and Florence Blissenden, Peart himself qualified as a teacher at the University of Durham in 1936. During his time at university he was President of the Durham Union for Epiphany term of 1936. He served in the Royal Artillery in World War II, gaining the rank of Captain. ==Political career== Peart was elected Member of Parliament for Workington in 1945, serving until 1976. He initially served as PPS to the Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries (Tom Williams). Peart, along with the rest of the Labour Party, went into opposition after Sir Winston Churchill's 1951 election victory. In 1964, he returned to government after Harold Wilson defeated Sir Alec Douglas-Home at that year's election. He was appointed to the Cabinet holding the Cabinet post of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. His tenure saw advances in pay for agricultural labourers, and in technology. In 1968, Peart became Lord Privy Seal, with no particular responsibilities. Seven months later, Peart became Leader of the House of Commons, taking the subsidiary title Lord President of the Council. After Labour lost the 1970 election, Peart returned to opposition as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. He held that position until December 1971, when he became Shadow Agriculture Minister. When Labour returned to power, Peart once more took the Agriculture portfolio. On 6 June 1975, Peart was involved in a train accident; he was on board a London to Glasgow sleeper train which crashed at Nuneaton, he survived the accident with minor injuries. On 23 September 1976, Peart was created a life peer as Baron Peart, of Workington in the County of Cumbria, to serve as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal at a time when the Labour faction in the Lords was tiny compared to the vast Tory majority, mainly composed of hereditary peers. After Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, Peart continued as Leader of the Labour Peers and thus became Shadow Leader of the House of Lords. He served in those roles until 1982, when he was defeated for re-election by Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos in a vote among Labour peers. ==See also== * List of Durham University people * List of Presidents of the Durham Union ==References== == External links == * |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1914 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Agriculture ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Alumni of the College of the Venerable Bede, Durham Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Cumbria MPs Category:GMB-sponsored MPs Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Leaders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:Lord Presidents of the Council Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964\u20131970 Category:Presidents of the Durham Union Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:UK MPs 1945\u20131950 Category:UK MPs 1950\u20131951 Category:UK MPs 1951\u20131955 Category:UK MPs 1955\u20131959 Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages ",
