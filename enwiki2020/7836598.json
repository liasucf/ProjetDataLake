In 2008 the original artwork of the logo was sold in the US to the Victoria and Albert Museum for $92,500, about \u00a371,000 in 2020. The design was revised by Craig Braun while he was designing the album package and was originally reproduced on the U.S. inner sleeve and cover of Sticky Fingers album released in April, 1971. In August 2008, the design was voted the greatest band logo of all time in an online poll conducted by Gigwise.
