    "text": "Luxor Linens, established in 2005 and headquartered in New Jersey, is an American textile company known for its textiles for hotels and households worldwide. Luxor Linens supplies bed and bath linens made of Egyptian cotton. It also provides services like custom- made orders, monogramming, etc. The company sells products to both hospitality clients and domestic users and in different events. The company sells their products through their showroom, website and stockist. A review of Better Business Bureau and other sites, including Google.com, where customers registered complaints about linens' quality and the lack of customer service belie the company's claim of high end service to hotels. Indeed, customers have registered BBB complaints of stained, items that were \"seconds\" (second quality manufacturing defects in items sold as first quality) and fraudulant or doctored items with tags removed. ==History== Jack Nekhala and Mike Nusinkis founded the company in 2005. ==Select hotels== The company provides linens to the following hotels worldwide, including: * The Ritz in London * The St. Regis Hotel in Atlanta * Hotel George V in Paris * The Mandarin Oriental in Boston * Raffles Hotel in Singapore * Savoy Hotel in London * Plaza Hotel in New York City * Ritz- Carlton in Los Angeles * All Ritz-Carlton U.S. properties * All CitizenM properties ==See also== == References == Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2005 Category:Luxury brands Category:American companies established in 2005 ",
