    "text": "The 1984\u201385 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one race, the 69th Indianapolis 500 on May 26, 1985. The USAC National Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Danny Sullivan. The schedule was based on a split- calendar, beginning in June 1984 and running through May 1985. Since USAC had dropped out of sanctioning Indy car races outside the Indy 500, the Gold Crown Championship consisted of only one event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART. ==Schedule and results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" ! Rnd ! Date ! Race Name ! Length ! Track !
