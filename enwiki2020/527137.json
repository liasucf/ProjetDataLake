    "text": "Northumbria, a kingdom of Angles, in what is now northern England and south- east Scotland, was initially divided into two kingdoms: Bernicia and Deira. The two were first united by Aethelfrith around the year 604, and except for occasional periods of division over the subsequent century, they remained so. The exceptions are during the brief period from 633 to 634, when Northumbria was plunged into chaos by the death of King Edwin in battle and the ruinous invasion of Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. The unity of the Northumbrian kingdoms was restored after Cadwallon's death in battle in 634. Another exception is a period from about the year 644 to 664, when kings ruled individually over Deira. In 651, King Oswiu had Oswine of Deira killed and replaced by Aethelwald, but Aethelwald did not prove to be a loyal sub-king, allying with the Mercian king Penda; according to Bede, Aethelwald acted as Penda's guide during the latter's invasion of Northumbria but withdrew his forces when the Mercians met the Northumbrians at the Battle of Winwaed. After the Mercian defeat at Winwaed, Aethelwald lost power and Oswiu's own son, Alchfrith, became king in his place. In 670, Aelfwine, the brother of the childless King Ecgfrith, was made king of Deira; by this point the title may have been used primarily to designate an heir. Aelfwine was killed in battle against Mercia in 679, and there was not another separate king of Deira until the time of Norse rule. ==Kings of Bernicia== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !|Reign !scope=\"col\" width=\"160\"|Incumbent !|Notes |- valign=top |c. 500 |Esa (Oesa) | Doubtful historicity as a king. |- valign=top |c. 520 |Eoppa | Doubtful historicity as a king.

The southern kings were usually vikings while the northern rulers were Anglo-Saxons. Some of the rulers controlled all or most of Northumbria although there is some doubt over the details as the history of Northumbria in the ninth and tenth centuries is poorly recorded. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Years !Ruler of southern Northumbria !Ruler of northern Northumbria !Notes |- |867 to 872 |Military conquest by the Great Heathen Army |Ecgberht I |Ecgberht I ruled north of the Tyne as a puppet king of the Danes. |- |872 to c. 875 |colspan=\"2\" |Ricsige |Probably ruled most of Northumbria as an sovereign Anglo-Saxon king. |- |c. 875 to 877 |Halfdan Ragnarsson |rowspan=\"2\"|Ecgberht II |rowspan=\"3\"| The year in which Ecgberht II ceased to be king is unclear. |- |877 to 883 |Interregnum in York |- |c. 883 to 895 |Guthred |Uncertain.
