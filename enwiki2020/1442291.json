    "text": "The Mycological Society of America (MSA) is a learned society that serves as the professional organization of mycologists in the U.S. and Canada. It was founded in 1932. The Society's constitution states that \"The purpose of the Society is to promote and advance the science of mycology and to foster and encourage research and education in mycology in all its aspects.\" Members of the MSA meet annually to exchange information and build understanding of fungi. ==Publications== Mycologia is the official scholarly journal of the Mycological Society of America. Six issues are published each year; members receive a subscription as a benefit of membership. Both members and non- members are invited to submit scholarly manuscripts for publication. As of 2002, Mycologia issues are available to subscribers online as well as in print. Inoculum is the Society's bimonthly newsletter. Though published in print through 2006, as of 2007 Inoculum is published online only and is freely accessible through the MSA website. The Mycological Society of America also publishes Mycologia Memoirs, an occasional series of scholarly monographs on aspects of fungal biology. ==Membership== In 2006, MSA membership included about 1190 members drawn from 51 different countries. The society's constitution states that \"Membership in the Society shall be open to persons or organizations who share the stated purposes of the Society.\" Members are eligible for many different annual awards that recognize scholarship, pedagogy, and research potential. The Mycological Society of America may bestow honorary membership on particularly distinguished mycologists who reside outside North America. ===Honorary members=== *1951, Ernst A G\u00e4umann, Switzerland d.1963 \u2013 Mycologia 57:1-5, 1965 *1955, Franz Petrak, Austria d.1973 *1965, G.C.
