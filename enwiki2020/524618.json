    "text": "is a prefecture of Japan located in the Ch\u016bbu region of Honsh\u016b.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. (2005). \"Aichi-ken\" ; \"Ch\u016bbu\" . Aichi Prefecture has a population of 7,552,873 (1 October 2019) and a geographic area of 5,172.92 km\u00b2 (1,997.28 sq mi) with a population density of 1,460 persons per km\u00b2. Aichi Prefecture borders Mie Prefecture to the west, Gifu Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture to the north, and Shizuoka Prefecture to the east. Nagoya is the capital and largest city of Aichi Prefecture, and the fourth-largest city in Japan, with other major cities including Toyota, Okazaki, and Ichinomiya. Aichi Prefecture and Nagoya form the core of the Ch\u016bky\u014d metropolitan area, the third-largest metropolitan area in Japan and one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world.Nussbaum, \"Nagoya\" . Aichi Prefecture is located on Japan's Pacific Ocean coast and forms part of the T\u014dkai region, a subregion of the Ch\u016bbu region and Kansai region. Aichi Prefecture is home to the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world's largest automotive manufacturer, the largest listed company in Japan by market capitalization, and sixth-largest company in the world by revenue, with its headquarters in the city of Toyota. Aichi Prefecture features the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Chubu Centrair International Airport, and Legoland Japan Resort. == History == Originally, the region was divided into the two provinces of Owari and Mikawa.Nussbaum, \"Provinces and prefectures\" . After the Meiji Restoration, Owari and Mikawa were united into a single entity. In 1871, after the abolition of the han system, Owari, with the exception of the Chita Peninsula, was established as Nagoya Prefecture, while Mikawa combined with the Chita Peninsula and formed Nukata Prefecture. Nagoya Prefecture was renamed to Aichi Prefecture in April 1872, and was united with Nukata Prefecture on November 27 of the same year. The government of Aichi Prefecture is located in the Aichi Prefectural Government Office in Nagoya, which is the old capital of Owari. The Aichi Prefectural Police and its predecessor organisations have been responsible for law enforcement in the prefecture since 1871. The Expo 2005 World Exposition was held in Seto and Nagakute. ===Etymology=== In the third volume of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b there is a poem by Takechi Kurohito that reads: \"The cry of the crane, calling to Sakurada; it sounds like the tide, draining from Ayuchi flats, hearing the crane cry\". Ayuchi is the original form of the name Aichi, and the Fujimae tidal flat is all that remains of the earlier Ayuchi-gata. It is now a protected area. For a time, an Aichi Station existed on the Kansai Line (at the time the Kansai Railway) between Nagoya and Hatta stations, but its role was overtaken by Sasashima-raibu Station on the Aonami Line and Komeno Station on the Kintetsu Nagoya Line. == Geography == Map of Aichi Prefecture Aichi Prefectural Government Office Satellite photo of Mikawa Bay Located near the center of the Japanese main island of Honshu, Aichi Prefecture faces the Ise and Mikawa Bays to the south and borders Shizuoka Prefecture to the east, Nagano Prefecture to the northeast, Gifu Prefecture to the north, and Mie Prefecture to the west. It measures east to west and south to north and forms a major portion of the N\u014dbi Plain. With an area of 5,172.48 km2 it accounts for approximately 1.36% of the total surface area of Japan. The highest spot is Chausuyama at above sea level. The western part of the prefecture is dominated by Nagoya, Japan's third largest city, and its suburbs, while the eastern part is less densely populated but still contains several major industrial centers. Due to its robust economy, for the period from October 2005 to October 2006, Aichi was the fastest growing prefecture in terms of population, beating Tokyo, at 7.4%. As of April 1, 2012, 17% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Aichi K\u014dgen, Hida-Kisogawa, Mikawa Wan, and Tenry\u016b-Okumikawa Quasi-National Parks along with seven Prefectural Natural Parks. ===Cities=== Thirty-eight cities are located in Aichi Prefecture. *Aisai *Ama *Anj\u014d *Chiry\u016b *Chita *Gamag\u014dri *Handa *Hekinan *Ichinomiya *Inazawa *Inuyama *Iwakura *Kariya *Kasugai *Kitanagoya *Kiyosu *Komaki *K\u014dnan *Miyoshi *Nagakute *Nagoya (capital) *Nishio *Nisshin *Okazaki *\u014cbu *Owariasahi *Seto *Shinshiro *Tahara *Takahama *Tokoname *T\u014dkai *Toyoake *Toyohashi *Toyokawa *Toyota *Tsushima *Yatomi File:Take Island from Mount Togami.jpg|Gamag\u014dri File:Inuyamamatsuri1.jpg|Inuyama File:Nagoya TV Tower1.jpg|Nagoya File:Okazaki city.jpg|Okazaki File:K\u014drankei.jpg|Toyota File:Tsushimajinja3.JPG|Tsushima File:ToyohashiSkyline02.jpg|Toyohashi ===Towns and villages=== These are the towns and villages in each district: *Aichi District **T\u014dg\u014d *Ama District **Kanie **\u014charu **Tobishima *Chita District **Agui **Higashiura **Mihama **Minamichita **Taketoyo *Kitashitara District **Shitara **T\u014dei **Toyone *Nishikasugai District **Toyoyama *Niwa District **Fus\u014d **\u014cguchi *Nukata District **K\u014dta File:Kaniegawa.JPG|Ama District, Kanie File:Kankonouen.JPG|Chita District, Minamichita File:Chausuyama02.jpg|Kitashitara District, Toyone File:Cherry blossoms on the gojo river.jpg|Niwa District, \u014cguchi File:Front Approach to Honkoji Temple (Kota Town).jpg|Nukata District, K\u014dta ===Mergers=== ==Economy== Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area Companies headquartered in Aichi include the following. {| |Aisin Seiki||Kariya |- |Brother Industries, Ltd.||Nagoya |- |Central Japan Railway Company||Nagoya |- |Denso Corporation||Kariya |- |Eisaku Noro Company||Ichinomiya |- |Makita Corporation||Anj\u014d |- |Matsuzakaya||Nagoya |- |Nagoya Railroad||Nagoya |- |Nippon Sharyo||Nagoya |- |Noritake||Nagoya |- |Sumitomo Riko||Komaki\"Domestic production and sales bases \".
