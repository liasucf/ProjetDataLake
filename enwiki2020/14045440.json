Knowlton graduated from Greater Atlanta Christian School in 1993 and from Bates College in 1997. ==Career== Prior to working at Bon App\u00e9tit, Knowlton worked for Lingua Franca magazine, as well as in the restaurant industry. He is currently in charge of Bon App\u00e9tit's blog presence and the editor of the restaurant section of the magazine.

He has also appeared on NBC's Today Show, the CBS Early Show, CNBC, and National Public Radio. ==Controversy== During the course of The Next Iron Chef, many people perceived Knowlton as being too hard on Chef Aar\u00f3n Sanchez. Anthony Bourdain said that \"Knowlton seems not to have disclosed a prior schoolyard incident with a young Aaron \"El Guapo\" Sanchez\u2014in which Sanchez (it would appear) bullied him mercilessly. He seemed unnaturally eager to send him packing.\"Duel in the Sun Michael Ruhlman referred to Knowlton as \"cranky,\" and said Knowlton \"is every bit the menace he appears. And it was hard to get to know him off camera\u2014he had a lot of handlers, so it was difficult to get any time with him.\" Ruhlman intended the comments as a joke, but people responding on his website and others let go on Knowlton with abandon.Next Iron Chef: Two Chefs Eliminated Tonight ==Personal life== Knowlton is married and lives in Austin, Texas. ==Television appearances== * Iron Chef America (guest judge) ** Episode IA0409, Batali/Abou-Ganim vs. Gadsby/Albert, Battle Mango ** Episode IA0502, Flay vs. Ford, Battle Blue foot chicken ** Episode IA0828, Flay v.
