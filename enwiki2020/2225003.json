At the beginning of his musical career, he was a member of several bands as a singer and guitarist. After the success of the first single \"Feel the Sunshine\", he recorded his debut album in 1974 under the title Feelings, which reached No. 1 in his homeland and stayed on the charts for half a year. The single \"Feelings\" was a soft rock hit song and became a one- hit wonder for Albert. The ballad reached the top ten U.S. Billboard charts in the summer of 1975 and sold more than 1 million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on 13 November 1975. In 1978 in the United States, he recorded another hit, \"She's My Girl\", among several other of his compositions.nostalgie.fr He currently lives in Italy with his family. ===\"Feelings\" controversy=== Feelings was based on a melody composed by French songwriter Loulou Gast\u00e9. Albert originally claimed the melody as his own, but was later successfully sued by Gast\u00e9 in 1988 for stealing of intellectual property.Louis Gast\u00e9 v.
