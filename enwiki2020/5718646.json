    "text": "Memorial to Falkiner in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Caesar Litton Falkiner (26 September 1863 \u2013 5 August 1908) was an Irish Unionist Party politician, barrister and a writer on literary and historical topics. ==Life== Falkiner was the second son of Sir Frederick Falkiner, who was subsequently the Recorder of Dublin (1876 \u20131905.) He studied at the University of Dublin (BA) \u2013 where he was the President of the University Philosophical Society (1885\u20131886) \u2013 and at the King's Inns, Dublin (prior to his call to the Bar in 1887.) He was an unsuccessful candidate in the South Armagh constituency at the 1892 United Kingdom general election. He appointed Assistant Legal Commissioner in the Irish Land Commission in 1897 and continued in that post until his death. He was also Secretary of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy. At the time of his death, Falkiner was preparing an edition of the letters of Jonathan Swift, a task which was taken up and completed (6 vols, 1910 \u2013 1914) by F Elrington Ball. It appears that the edition of Thomas Moore's poetry which he was reportedly preparing for the Clarendon Press was never completed. (Godley (1910) seems not to be a continuation of this work.) He was killed in an accident on 5 August 1908 while on a mountain-climbing holiday in the Alps. In 1910 a memorial to him was erected in the south aisle of the nave of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, beside the bust commemorating W.E.H. Lecky. The memorial consists of a bronze bas relief portrait of Falkiner, on a marble ground, with an inscription. At the unveiling of this monument, his contemporary and friend Colonel Edward Macartney-Filgate spoke as follows: ==Family== Falkiner had married on 4 August 1892 Henrietta Mary Deane, daughter of Sir Thomas Newenham Deane, with whom he had two daughters. ==Works as Author== Map of 16th century Ireland from Falkiner, Illustrations of Irish history and topography (London, 1904). * * * * * * * * * ==Works as Editor== * * * * * * * * ==Notes== ==References== * * 183 * * * v-vi * * Category:20th- century Irish historians Category:Irish antiquarians Category:Irish Anglicans Category:Irish non-fiction writers Category:Irish male non-fiction writers Category:Irish barristers Category:Irish Unionist Party politicians Category:1908 deaths Category:1863 births ",
