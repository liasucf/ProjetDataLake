The oldest document recording the street's existence originates from 1307 under the name Slacovse gasse. Formerly, the northern point of the street was enclosed by the S\u0142awkowska Gate and a bulwark. During the urban modernisation of Krak\u00f3w (1817-1822), the city walls and the gatehouse were deconstructed. The street ends by the Planty Park with Basztowa Street (Ulica Basztowa, lit. Tower Street), where it continues as D\u0142uga Street (Ulica D\u0142uga, lit. Long Street). ==Features== {| |----- bgcolor=\"#FF 8C 00\" ! width=4% | Street No. ! width=26% | Short description ! width=10% | Picture |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 1 || align=\"center\"| Ludwikowski House - a historic townhouse built in 1776.
