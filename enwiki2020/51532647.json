Born in Toulouse, he was teacher of rhetorics at the college of Auxerre, then special tutor to J\u00e9r\u00f4me-P\u00e9lagie Masson de Meslay's son (president of the Chambre des comptes of Paris from 1768 to 1790), called pr\u00e9sident de Meslay. We owe him a translation of the Works by Plutarch: the Moralia were published from 1783 to 1795, and the Vies des Hommes illustres from 1798 to 1803. Dominique Ricard was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des observateurs de l'homme. == Sources == Category:People from Toulouse Category:1741 births Category:1803 deaths Category:French translators Category:Greek\u2013French translators ",
