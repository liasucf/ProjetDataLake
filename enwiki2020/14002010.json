    "text": "Embrun Cathedral The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Embrun was located in southeastern France, in the mountains of the Maritime Alps, on a route that led from Gap by way of Brian\u00e7on to Turin. It had as suffragans the Diocese of Digne, Diocese of Antibes and Grasse, Diocese of Vence, Diocese of Gland\u00e8ves, Diocese of Senez and Diocese of Nice. Its see was the Cathedral of N\u00f4tre Dame in Embrun. The former French Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Embrun was suppressed after the French Revolution. It was replaced, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) by a diocese which had the same boundaries of the civil departement in which it was located. The diocese was called 'Haute-Alpes', with its center at Gap. When the Diocese of Gap was re- established in 1822 it comprised, besides the ancient Diocese of Gap, a large part of the ancient archdiocese of Embrun. The name of the metropolitan see of Embrun, however, had been absorbed in the title of the Archbishop of Aix-en- Provence and Arles, until 2007. In 2008, the title of Embrun was reattached to the Diocese of Gap by papal decree of Pope Benedict XVI.Papal bull on the Diocese of Gap website ==History== Palladius of Embrun was a bishop of Embrun during the 6th century. Tradition ascribes the evangelization of Embrun to Saints Nazarius and Celsus, martyrs under emperor Nero. Gregory of Tours states that they were martyred at Embrun. Their bodies, however, were discovered in a cemetery in Milan by Saint Ambrose. They were also drowned at Trier, on orders of the Emperor Nero. Their entire story is without historical foundation, and a mass of contradictions and improbabilities. According to another tradition, the first Bishop of Embrun, Saint Marcellus, was such a successful preacher that, by the end of his episcopacy, there was not a single pagan left in the diocese. The see became an archbishopric about 800. In 1056 Pope Victor confirmed the Archbishop of Embrun as Metropolitan of the Sees of Digne, Chorges, Solli\u00e8s, Senez, Gland\u00e8ves, Cimiez-Nice, Vence, and Antibes (Grasse). Bishop WinimannThe name is also spelled Viminian, Vivemnus, Wimman, Guiniman, Guitmund, and Guiriman: Fisquet, p. 843. was also granted the palliumFisquet, p. 844. It is pointed out that two of the bishoprics no longer existed in 1076, and it is suggested that the list is a later addition to the document. In 1276 the Archbishops of Embrun were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The see was suppressed in the French Revolution, being transferred to the diocese of Gap, and the cathedral church became a mere parish church. ==Notable Bishops of Embrun== *St. Guillaume (1120\u201334), founder of the Abbey of Boscodon;The abbey was actually founded by Guillaume and Pierre de Montmirail in 1130; in 1132 the Benedictine Rule was adopted; in 1142 the Bishop of Embrun, another Guillaume, thought the monks so mediocre that he imported several monks from Chalais. *Henry of Segusio (1250\u201371), known as (H)Ostiensis, i.e. Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, an orator and canonist of renown; *Bertrand de D\u00e9aulx (1323\u201338), who as the legate of Clement VI at Rome did much to bring about the downfall of Rienzi; *Giulio de' Medici (1510\u201311), later pope under the name of Clement VII; *Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois de Tournon (1517\u201326), employed on diplomatic missions by King Francis I of France, and founder of the College de Tournon; *Cardinal de Tencin (1724\u201340), who in September, 1727, caused the condemnation by the Council of Embrun of the *Jansenist Soanen, Bishop of his suffragan see of Senez. *St. Vincent Ferrer preached several missions against the Vaudois in the Diocese of Embrun. ==Bishops== * \u2020 by 374: Marcellinus.Duchesne, p. 290, argues that his consecration took place in the 360s. * 374: Artemius *c. 400: JacobCf. Duchesne, p. 291 n.1, who indicates that there is nothing to show that Armentarius or Jacobus were bishops of Embrun. * 439: ArmentariusIn the episcopal election at Embrun in 438, two factions elected two bishops in the midst of threats and violence, especially involving laypersons; one of the elect, Armentarius, was below the canonical age for consecration, but, without the knowledge and consent of the bishops of the province, he got two bishops somehow to consecrate him. The matter was brought to the Council of Riez, which met on 29 November 439, fourteen bishops being present. The election was annulled as uncanonical, and Armentarius, who had resigned before he received the summons to attend the Council, was treated leniently and given the status of chorepiscopus, though it was made clear that this did not involve any of the prerogatives of a legitimate bishop. Sirmond, pp. 439\u2013448. Duchesne, p. 291. * 440-\u2020 ca 475:Ingenuus was present at the Council of Orange on 4 November 441: He was also at the Council of Arles in 451 and the Council of Arles in 455.

In attempting to apply the canons to Embrun, however, he aroused the anger of the Arian aristocracy, who drove him into exile. He lived in Vienne for four or five years.

He was deposed a second time at the Council of Ch\u00e2lons in 579 and locked up in a monastery. Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks Book V, chapter xx. Sirmond, pp. 1163-1164.
