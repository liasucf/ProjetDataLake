    "text": "Simon of Hauteville (Palermo 1093 \u2013 Mileto 1105), called Simon de Hauteville in French and Simone D'Altavilla in Italian, was the eldest son and successor of Roger the Great Count, count of Sicily, and Adelaide del Vasto, under whose regency he reigned. The chronicler Alexander of Telese relates an incident that took place during the childhood of Simon and his brother, Roger: > As the way of children, they were playing a coin game which was a favorite > of theirs, and fell to fighting. When they fought, each with a group of boys > whom they had gathered together, the younger, Roger, was the conqueror. As a > result, he mocked his brother Simon, saying, \"It would be far better that I > should have the honor of ruling triumphantly after our father's death than > you. However, when I shall be able to do this I shall make you a bishop or > even Pope in Rome - to which you're far better suited. Simon was young when he ascended to the county in 1101 and he died only four years later in Mileto, Calabria in 1105. His death allowed his brother, Roger, who would be King of Sicily, to succeed him. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1093 births Category:1105 deaths Category:12th-century rulers of Sicily Category:Italo-Normans Category:Sicilian people of Norman descent Category:Medieval child rulers Category:People from Palermo ",
