    "text": "is a Japanese monthly yonkoma seinen manga magazine published by H\u014dbunsha since April 1995. The magazine was published in the 1990s as Manga Time Z\u014dkan. Before the May 2005 issue, the magazine was released on the 12th day of the month, but is now released monthly on the 4th. Manga Time Jumbo is printed as B5 size. From February 1992 through October 2000, a \"New Yonkoma Artist Panel\" was convened. Every month, two to three works by newcomers would be included in the magazine, and readers would vote on them by sending in their opinions on a reply card. The winners of the contests would have their works serialized. Winners during this period include Ry\u014dji Sekine, Poisson d'Avril, Takeshi \u014csawa, Sh\u014dko Fujita, Uina Kinomoto, T\u014dko Shiwasu, Ky\u016bten Yuminaga, Nantoka, Tomoko Inoue, Shihori Watanabe, Eiji Ide, and Hairan. Manga Time Jumbo had a \"renewal\" of sorts when it picked up series dropped by Manga Time Pop when it ceased publication in December 2003. The magazine's main draw, however, is due to its serialization of new works. ==Currently serialized works== Listed alphabetically. *Akarui F\u016bfu Keikaku (Tomoko Inoue, April 2001 - February 2006, currently on hiatus) *Aoi-chan to Yamato-kun (T\u014dko Shiwasu, since July 2001) *Atsumu Toy Town (Masahito Mizuki, since December 2008) *Boku no Shach\u014dsama (Hiroshi Aro, since March 2004) *Boy's Time (Kaoru Fujinagi, since September 2004) *Damasarete Miko (P\u0101rin Sanada, since June 2006) *Gochamaze My Sister (Shihori Watanabe, since December 2003) *Happy Come Come (Atsuko Katagiri, since September 2005) *Himajin (Naoki Shigeno, since August 2000) *Kibun wa J\u014dj\u014d (Mairu Nanao, since April 2004) *Ko Usagi Tsukikoyomi (Nantoka, since July 2007) *Master Dog (Takashi Miyasaka, since May 2008) *Onegai Asakura-san (Uina Kinomoto, since January 2001) *P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re!
