    "text": "Court and Spark is the sixth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. It was an immediate commercial and critical success\u2014and remains her most successful album. Released in January 1974, it has been described as pop, but also infuses Mitchell's folk rock style, which she had developed through her previous five albums, with jazz inflections. It reached No. 2 in the United States and No. 1 in Canada and eventually received a double platinum certification by the RIAA, the highest of Mitchell's career. It also reached the Top 20 in the UK and was voted the best album of the year for 1974 in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. In 2003 it was listed at No. 111 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. ==History== 1973 was the first year since she began recording that Mitchell did not release a new album. Her previous offering, For the Roses, was released in November 1972 to critical and commercial success, and Mitchell decided to spend the whole of the next year writing and recording a new album that revealed her growing interest in new sounds\u2014particularly jazz. During 1973, her stage appearances were fewer than in previous years. She performed in April in a benefit concert at the Sir George Williams University Auditorium and then appeared live again in August, twice at The Corral Club, accompanied by Neil Young. Mitchell spent most of 1973 in the recording studio creating Court and Spark. Mitchell and engineer Henry Lewy called in a number of top L.A. musicians to perform on the album including members of the Crusaders, Tom Scott's L.A. Express, cameos from Robbie Robertson, David Crosby & Graham Nash and even a twist of comedy from Cheech & Chong. On December 1, Asylum Records released a single, her first in over a year, \"Raised on Robbery\". The single reached No. 65 on the Billboard Singles Chart in February 1974. ==Reception== Released in January 1974, Court and Spark was enthusiastically embraced by critics and the public. Its success was reaffirmed when the follow-up single, \"Help Me\", was released in March. It received heavy radio airplay and became Mitchell's first and only Top 10 Billboard single, peaking at No.7 on the Hot 100 in the first week of June, and reaching No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Court and Spark became a big seller that year, peaking at No.2 on the Billboard album chart and staying there for four weeks. The pinnacle of Mitchell's commercial success, it was kept from the top spot by (in order) Bob Dylan's Planet Waves, Barbra Streisand's The Way We Were and John Denver's Greatest Hits. However, it did top the US Cashbox and Record World charts for one week each. In a July 1979 interview with Cameron Crowe for Rolling Stone, Mitchell recounted playing the then-just completed Court & Spark to Bob Dylan, during which he fell asleep.Rolling Stone article: \"The Rolling Stone Joni Mitchell Interview\", by Cameron Crowe. July 26, 1979. She later suggested that Dylan was probably trying to be \"cute\" in front of label boss David Geffen, who was also present. Singer Stevie Nicks recalled taking acid to the album: \"I was with my producer, at his house, with a set of speakers that were taller than that fireplace, and I was in a safe place. And I sat there on the floor and listened to that record\u2026 That was a pretty dynamic experience.\" ==Honors== * RIAA certifications: gold February 27, 1974; platinum and double platinum December 12, 1997. * In 1974, Court and Spark was voted the 'Best Album of the Year' in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll. * It was voted number 116 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). * In 2003, the album was ranked No. 111 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 114 in a 2012 revised list. * In 2006, Court and Spark was included in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ;Grammy Awards |- | style=\"width:35px; text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|1975 ||Court and Spark || Album of the Year || |- | rowspan=\"2\"|\"Help Me\" || Record of the Year|| |- | Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|| |- | \"Down to You\" (arranger: Joni Mitchell and Tom Scott) || Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)|| |- ==Track listing== All tracks are written by Joni Mitchell, except where noted. ;Side one # \"Court and Spark\" \u2013 2:46 # \"Help Me\" \u2013 3:22 # \"Free Man in Paris\" \u2013 3:02 # \"People's Parties\" \u2013 2:15 # \"The Same Situation\" \u2013 2:57 ;Side two # \"Car on a Hill\" \u2013 3:02 # \"Down to You\" \u2013 5:38 # \"Just Like This Train\" \u2013 4:24 # \"Raised on Robbery\" \u2013 3:06 # \"Trouble Child\" \u2013 4:00 # \"Twisted\" (Annie Ross, Wardell Gray) \u2013 2:21 ==Personnel== * Joni Mitchell \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, piano; clavinet * Tom Scott \u2013 woodwinds, reeds * Joe Sample \u2013 electric piano; clavinet * Larry Carlton \u2013 electric guitar * Max Bennett \u2013 bass guitar * John Guerin \u2013 drums, percussion ;Additional personnel * Chuck Findley \u2013 trumpet * Jos\u00e9 Feliciano \u2013 electric guitar * Wayne Perkins \u2013 electric guitar * Robbie Robertson \u2013 electric guitar * Dennis Budimir \u2013 electric guitar * Wilton Felder \u2013 bass guitar * Jim Hughart \u2013 bass guitar * Milt Holland \u2013 chimes * David Crosby \u2013 backing vocals * Graham Nash \u2013 backing vocals * Susan Webb \u2013 backing vocals * Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong \u2013 background voices ;Technical personnel * Joni Mitchell \u2014 record producer * Henry Lewy and Ellis Sorkin \u2014 engineers * Anthony Hudson \u2013 art direction, design * Joni Mitchell \u2013 cover painting * Norman Seeff \u2014 photography ==Chart history== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1974) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Kent Music Report |34 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian RPM Albums Chart |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Norwegian Albums Chart |18 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums Chart |14 |- !scope=\"row\"|U.S. Billboard Pop Albums |2 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1974) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums Chart |23 |- !scope=\"row\"|U.S. Billboard Pop Albums |13 |} ===Certifications=== == References == Category:1974 albums Category:Joni Mitchell albums Category:Asylum Records albums Category:Albums recorded at A&M; Studios Category:Albums produced by Henry Lewy Category:Albums produced by Joni Mitchell Category:Albums with cover art by Joni Mitchell ",
