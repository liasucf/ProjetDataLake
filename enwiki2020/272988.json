    "text": "The Chinese mountain cat (Felis bieti), also known as Chinese desert cat and Chinese steppe cat, is a wild cat endemic to western China that has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the effective population size may be fewer than 10,000 mature breeding individuals. It was provisionally classified as a wildcat subspecies with the name F. silvestris bieti in 2007. It is recognised as a valid species since 2017, as it is morphologically distinct from wildcats. ==Taxonomy== The scientific name Felis bieti was proposed by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1892 who described the Chinese mountain cat based on a skin collected in Sichuan Province. He named it Felis Bieti after the French missionary F\u00e9lix Biet. Some authorities consider the chutuchta and vellerosa subspecies of the wildcat as Chinese mountain cat subspecies. ==Characteristics== The Chinese mountain cat has sand-coloured fur with dark guard hairs. Faint dark horizontal stripes on the face and legs are hardly visible. Its ears have black tips. It has a relatively broad skull, and long hair growing between the pads of their feet. It is whitish on the belly, and its legs and tail bear black rings. The tip of the tail is black. It is long in head and body with a long tail. Adults weigh from . ==Distribution and habitat== The Chinese mountain cat is endemic to China and lives on the north- eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It was recorded only in eastern Qinghai and north-western Sichuan. It inhabits high-elevation steppe grassland, alpine meadow, alpine shrubland and coniferous forest edges between elevation. It has not been confirmed in true desert or heavily forested mountains. The first photographs of a wild Chinese mountain cat were taken by camera traps during light snow in May 2007 at elevation in Sichuan. These photographs were taken in rolling grasslands and brush-covered mountains. One individual was observed and photographed in May 2015 in the Ruoergai grasslands. Between autumn 2018 and spring 2019, Chinese mountain cats were documented in an alpine meadow in the southeastern Sanjiangyuan region. == Ecology and behaviour == The Chinese mountain cat is active at night and preys on pikas, rodents and birds. It breeds between January and March. Females give birth to two to four kittens in a secluded burrow. Until 2007, the Chinese mountain cat was known only from six individuals, all living in Chinese zoos, and a few skins in museums. == Threats == The Chinese mountain cat is threatened due to the organised poisoning of pikas. The poison used diminishes prey species and also kills cats unintentionally. == Conservation == Felis bieti is listed on CITES Appendix II. It is protected in China. ==See also== *List of endangered and protected species of China ==References== ==External links== * * Chinese Mountain Cat Category:Mammals described in 1892 Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Mammals of China ",
