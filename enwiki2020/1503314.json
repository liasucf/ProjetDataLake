    "text": "Hristo Atanasov Bonev (; born 3 February 1947), also known as Zuma (), is a former Bulgarian footballer. He last managed PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the Bulgarian A PFG. One of the greatest Bulgarian footballers, Bonev was renowned for his vision and technique. Between 1967 and 1979, Bonev played for the Bulgarian national team 96 times, scoring a record 48 goals. He played for his country at the 1970 and 1974 World Cups. Most of Bonev's club career was spent with Lokomotiv Plovdiv, but he also played for CSKA Sofia and AEK Athens FC and later briefly came out of retirement to play for Oxford United in 1982, before an injury to his thigh muscle ended his playing career. After his retirement he became a manager and initially went to Greece and became coach of Panathinaikos FC, AEL 1964, Ionikos FC. After Greece, he became manager of the Cypriot team APOEL FC in 1995 and until 1996 when he quit from his team, he won the Cup in his first year in Cyprus in 1995 and the Double the following season. He went back to his home country to become manager of Lokomotiv Sofia and then he was appointed as head coach to his country's national team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Despite a disappointing showing in France, with only one point achieved from three games, he continued as national coach, but after a 3\u20130 defeat to Poland in the first qualifying match for Euro 2000 in September 1998, he decided to resign from his post, stating \"I believe I have taken the team as far as I am able, and now it is time for the players to respond to someone else who, I hope, can improve our results.\" Bonev in 1974 ==International goals== :Scores and results list Bulgaria's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Bulgaria goal. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ List of international goals scored by Hristo Bonev |- ! # !!
