Founded in 1974, the team belonged to the North American Soccer League where it played both indoor and outdoor soccer. The team folded after the 1983 NASL outdoor season. ==History== A Seattle expansion team for the North American Soccer League was proposed in early 1973 as part of a new Western Division that would include Los Angeles, San Jose, and Vancouver. On December 11, 1973, the league awarded an expansion team to Seattle that would be owned by a group of local businessmen led by Walter Daggatt of the Alpac Corporation; the team would play at Memorial Stadium in the Western Division alongside new teams in Los Angeles, San Francisco (later moved to San Jose), and Vancouver. A naming contest was held in January 1974, with a shortlist of six finalists: Cascades, Evergreens, Mariners, Schooners, Sockeyes, and Sounders. \"Sounders\" was announced as the winner of the contest on January 21, having been chosen in 32 percent of the 3,735 votes cast by the public. The franchise folded on September 6, 1983, after majority owners Frank and Vince Coluccio struggled to keep the club afloat until the team did not qualify for the playoffs. The Coluccio family bought the franchise in 1979. ==Stadium== The Sounders played at Memorial Stadium for their first two seasons before moving to the Kingdome. On April 25, 1976, 58,218 watched the Seattle Sounders and the New York Cosmos in the first sports event held in the Kingdome. From 1979 to 1982, they competed in three NASL Indoor campaigns, playing their home games also at the Kingdome. ==Supporters== The Seattle Sounders were supported by the \"Seattle Sounders Booster Club\" in the 1970s and early 1980s. ==Year- by-year== This is a complete list of seasons for the NASL club.
