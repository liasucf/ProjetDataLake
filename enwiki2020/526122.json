    "text": "The Buzz was a Canadian comedy television series that aired on The Comedy Network. The show was hosted by Morgan \"Mista Mo\" Smith and Daryn Jones. The show originally aired in the mid-90s as a community channel show on Rogers Television before getting a network deal in 2000. In 2001, the show won a Gemini Award in the \"Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Program or Series\" category. The 2003 season saw them take the show to New York, London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. The show ended in 2005. Created in Toronto, the show found a place on the Comedy Network when The Tom Green Show left to MTV. The show uses sketch comedy, non-sequiturs and guerrilla comedy. The two hosts, Daryn Jones, a geeky theatre major, and Mista Mo, an \"almost real rapper\" often riff on the racial tensions between them. ==Recurring sketches and characters== *Annual Fat Pride Parade *Selling Parked Cars *Break Stuff - end- segment, where either hosts break items (TV's, eggs) or pedestrians battle each other *The BuzzCops - Daryn and Mo, dressed as policemen, dole out misguided justice to Toronto's citizens. *The BuzzNews - The Buzz's take on fake news (The Daily Show, Weekend Update) *The Cable Access Painter - Daryn parodies PBS painter Bob Ross, with homosexual overtones. *Captain Harassment - Features Daryn's left hand, clad in a rubber glove with a Canadian flag cape, sneaking up behind women, and pinching their asses. *Country Mo Dee - Music videos of Mista Mo's alter-ego, a country hip-hop sensation. *Thug Steel - Music videos of Mista Mo's alter-alter-ego, a gospel gangsta rap sensation. *Fluff E. the Hip-Hop Bunny - Series regular Jean-Paul dresses up as a giant pink bunny, to the glee of young children.
