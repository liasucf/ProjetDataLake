It was named for Judah Touro, a public- spirited citizen of New Orleans and well-known philanthropist, who bequeathed $20,000 to the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia in 1854. The building was constructed to provide Jewish education and social resources for the neighborhood's growing Jewish immigrant community. Touro Hall was built and opened in 1891 by the Hebrew Education Society, and featured a bathing pool and library. It was home to Hebrew School No. 2, and served as a center for Jewish life in South Philadelphia through the 1920s. Fabiani Italian Hospital was located in Touro Hall from the 1920s until its closure in 1968. The building was demolished in 1977 and replaced with Bardascino Park which includes a public bocce court. ==Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia== Judah Touro, Benefactor, Hebrew Education Society Touro Hall, Philadelphia PA (1899) Rabbi Isaac Leeser came to Philadelphia to serve at Mikveh Israel in 1829.

The hospital had moved to the southwest corner of 10th and Carpenter Streets and into Tours Hall by 1927. The name changed to Philadelphia Italian Hospital in 1936, and to Community Hospital in 1942. Community Hospital closed in 1968 and the building was demolished in 1977. ==Bardascino Park== Bardascino Park in January 2020 The City of Philadelphia created Bardascino Park on the former Touro Hall site in 1978, named for Giuseppe Bardascino, longtime maestro of the Philadelphia Brass Band, and manager of the Philadelphia Italian Band who was a longtime resident of the neighborhood. The Friends of Bardascino Park formed in 1991 to beautify the park. In 1999 the group became a part of the Parks Revitalization Project, a collaborative partnership between the City of Philadelphia's Department of Recreation and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's Philadelphia Green initiative. The group has secured multiple community partnerships and grants, renovated the park in 2003 and 2004, and has continued to maintain it. The park has an active bocce court and the park's summer bocce league began in 1997. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Jewish day schools in the United States Category:Jews and Judaism in Pennsylvania Category:Jews and Judaism in Philadelphia Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Philadelphia Category:Demolished religious buildings and structures Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1977 ",
