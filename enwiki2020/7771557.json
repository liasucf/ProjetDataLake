    "text": "\"Into the Night\" is a 1980 song by American pop singer-songwriter Benny Mardones, from his album Never Run, Never Hide. ==Overview== The song is unusual for being one of only 10 recordings to ever ascend to the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart twice. The chartings, in 1980 and 1989, were of two similar but separate recordings. Chubby Checker was first to do this with his cover of \"The Twist\", a single that went to No. 1 in September 1960 and again in January 1962. \"Into the Night\" is a track that Mardones re-recorded many times: *The original and best-known 1980 version, which can be found on the album Never Run, Never Hide, duration: 4:32. *The 1989 version, released on Curb Records, which can be found on his self-titled album, duration: 4:22. *The 2002 version, which can be found on the album A Journey Through Time, duration: 4:26. *The 2002 acoustic version, also found on A Journey Through Time, duration: 4:08. *The 2019 version, retitled \"Into the Night 2019 (Eric Kupper Extended Club Mix)\", remixed by Eric Kupper. This version, is more influenced by dance than his usual soft rock trademark, duration: 5:51. *Finally, another 2019 version, this time retitled \"Into the Night V3\", produced by Joel Diamond. A new music video of this song can be found on Diamond's YouTube channel. This version returns to Mardones' soft rock roots, duration: 3:46. Mardones originally released \"Into the Night\" in June 1980. The song peaked at No. 11 on the Hot 100 for two weeks in September 1980, logging 20 weeks on the chart before falling off in late October. Mardones was unable to duplicate the success of \"Into the Night\" and is considered a one- hit wonder. In 1989, a \"Where Are They Now?\" Arizona radio segment spurred L.A. DJ Scott Shannon to add the song to his playlist, ultimately rocketing the song back onto the national charts, on May 6, 1989. Mardones' recording peaked this time at No. 20 the first week in July, adding 17 weeks to its previous run of 20, to add up to a total of 37 (nonconsecutive) weeks. \"Into the Night\" was a hit on Adult Contemporary radio this time as well, where it spent 19 weeks and peaked at No. 20. The original song was performed in C minor, but shortly before his retirement in 2017, Mardones performed it in Bb minor to accommodate his aging voice. ==Music video== Mardones made a music video for the song, but, as it predated MTV by a year, it was not widely broadcast. The video opens with Mardones walking down a street and approaching a house. The song plays over the video, and the lyrics serve as Mardones' monologue. He is met at the door by a bearded man who tells him, \"She's just 16 years old. Leave her alone.\" Mardones leaves and walks around to the back of the house, peering through a window at a girl sitting sullenly in her room. The video then cuts to Mardones at a pay phone, speaking to the girl on the other end of the line and professing his love. The video then cuts again to Mardones returning to the girl's house, carrying a rolled-up carpet. He crawls through her bedroom window, unrolls the magic carpet, and taking the girl's hand, they take flight into the night sky. The video closes with Mardones serenading the girl as they embrace; the scene finally fades to black as they kiss. For many years the video was difficult to find in its entirety, although clips were featured in infomercials for Time-Life Soft Rock compilations.YouTube: TIME LIFE Classic Soft Rock infomercial part 1 On July 2, 2016, a full version of the video was uploaded to YouTube.YouTube: Link to original 1980 video ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1980) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|12 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|29 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|11 |- !Chart (1981) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|19 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Rapper Triple J used the melody and interpolated \"Into the Night\" for his song \"16 Years Old\". American band Pure Bathing Culture interpolates part of the melody and refrain of \"Into the Night\" on their song \"Scotty\" from the 2013 album Moon Tides. ==See also== *List of 1980s one-hit wonders in the United States ==References== Category:1980 singles Category:1980 songs Category:1989 singles Category:Benny Mardones songs Category:Polydor Records singles ",
