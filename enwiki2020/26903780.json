    "text": "An American trolley in a Manila street, 1905 The transportation system in Metro Manila is currently inadequate to accommodate the mobility and other basic needs of an densely populated metropolis, the result of many factors and problems that the government has failed to provide or address. Metro Manila exists in a state of near-permanent gridlock, with people and goods trapped by the very transportation system that is supposed to move them quickly and efficiently.https://www.rappler.com/views/imho/134847-open-letter-duterte- traffic-crisis Because of the insufficient public transportation network, car ownership has risen dramatically, contributing further to the congestion that occurs at all times of day on the road. Filipinos view cars as tools to get them to where they need to go; they also believe that their car is an important symbol of the success they have achieved in life.https://gdfi.com.ph/2018/10/25/car-ownership-philippines/ In recent years, however, the Philippine government has been pushing to improve the system through various infrastructure projects, hoping to solve the interlinked problems of transportation, land use and environment.https://www.jica.go.jp/topics/news/2014/ku57pq00001nkatn- att/20140917_01_0rev20150206.pdf Since the government shifted the infrastructure needs of Metro Manila into sharper focus with the \"Build Build Build\" program of the Duterte administration, traffic relief will gradually become a reality. The program aims to usher in \"a golden age of infrastructure\" in the country, with most of the 75 projects lined up and in various stages of completion directly impacting the Greater Capital Region, composed of Metro Manila, Region 3 (Central Luzon) and Region 4A (Calabarzon).http://www.build.gov.ph/ Manila, being a major city, offers various transportation options: light metro, rapid transit, commuter rail, bus, jeepney, UV Express and taxicab. The most famous of these modes is the public jeepney, which has been in use since the years immediately after World War II. Auto rickshaws (referred to as \"tricycles\" in the Philippines) and pedicabs are used for short distances. Because Metro Manila is one of the most heavily-populated cities in the world, it is now served by rapid mass rail transit. More train lines are planned and under construction. ==Infrastructure== ===Roads=== The existing main roads of Metro Manila are organized around a set of Radial and Circumferential roads established during the American period in the country's history. All R roads originate from various points in the city of Manila and radiate south, east or north to the other cities in Metro Manila and end farther out into the Greater Capital Region and beyond. In a similar way, all C roads run in a half circle that begins and ends at Manila Bay, with Manila at the innermost circle. The only major thoroughfare in Metro Manila not included in the arterial road system is Dr. Arcadio Santos Avenue (formerly Sucat Road) in Paranaque, designated as Highway N63. ==== Radial roads ==== *Radial Road 1 - Anchored on Roxas Blvd, from Bonifacio Drive up to and including Cavitex in Kawit, Cavite. A portion of Roxas Blvd is designated as Highway N61. *Radial Road 2 - Anchored on Taft Avenue, from the Lagusnilad Underpass in front of Manila City Hall up to and including Aguinaldo Highway in Cavite. Part of the road is designated Highway N62. *Radial Road 3 - Anchored on Osmena Highway/SLEX, from Quirino Avenue through to the Santo Tomas exit in Batangas. *Radial Road 4 - An incomplete road, it starts from Pedro Gil Street through Makati where the main part of the road is J.P.Rizal Avenue. From there, the road is undefined until it reaches Pateros and Taytay before ending at the Manggahan Floodway. *Radial Road 5 - Anchored on Shaw Boulevard and Ortigas Avenue, from V. Mapa Street up to and including the Manila East Road. Part of the road is designated as Highway N60. *Radial Road 6 - Anchored on Magsaysay Boulevard and Aurora Boulevard, from Legarda Street up to and including the Marikina-Infanta Highway. The road is designated as either Highway N59 or N180 . *Radial Road 7 - Anchored on Espana Boulevard, Quezon Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue, from Lerma up to and including Quirino Highway to Bulacan. *Radial Road 8 - Anchored on Dimasalang Street and NLEX, from Quiapo to Clark in Pampanga. *Radial Road 9 - Anchored on Rizal Avenue, from Carriedo to MacArthur Highway in Rosario, Pangasinan. *Radial Road 10 - Anchored on Marcos Road in Tondo, from the Del Pan Bridge up to the intersection with C-4. ==== Circumferential roads ==== *Circumferential Road 1 - Anchored on Recto Avenue and Ayala Avenue, from Tondo to the Luneta Park. *Circumferential Road 2 - Anchored on Lacson and Quirino avenues, from Tondo to Roxas Boulevard. *Circumferential Road 3 - An incomplete road, anchored on Araneta Avenue, from R-10 in Navotas to Buendia Avenue in Pasay, with the broken segment in Makati. *Circumferential Road 4 - Dominated by the whole length of EDSA, from the R-10 intersection to the Mall of Asia in Pasay. *Circumferential Road 5 - Segments are incomplete but under construction (as of Feb. 2019), from NLEX Karuhatan segment to the FTI area in Taguig, and ultimately to the Coastal Road (Cavitex) in Las Pinas. *Circumferential Road 6 - The beltway of Metro Manila, it will be anchored by the Southeast Metro Manila Expressway (also known as Skyway Stage 4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uytbWBgEgU) currently under construction, from MacArthur Highway in Marilao, Bulacan to Kawit, Cavite. === Expressways === Expressways are controlled-access highways, with crossing traffic limited to overpasses, underpasses, and interchanges. Metro Manila is served by the following expressways: *North Luzon Expressway *Skyway *South Luzon Expressway *Muntinlupa\u2013Cavite Expressway *NAIA Expressway There are expressways under construction or proposed. These include: * Skyway Stage 3https://ppp.gov.ph/ppp_projects/skyway-stage-3/ * Southeast Metro Manila Expressway * C-5 South Link Expressway * C-5 Expressway * Pasig River Expressway * Metro Manila Skybridge * Manila\u2013Quezon Expressway * R-7 Expressway === Bridges === There are a total of 32 bridge spans in Metro Manila that cross the Pasig and Marikina rivers, including four rail-only bridges, the Line 1, Line 2, Line 3 and the PNR tracks. ====Pasig River Bridges==== The bridges are listed below in west to east order, with the first bridge nearest to the mouth of the Pasig River into Manila Bay. * Roxas Bridge - formerly called Del Pan Bridge (San Nicolas to Port Area) * Jones Bridge - formerly called Puente de Espa\u00f1a (Binondo to Ermita) * MacArthur Bridge (Sta. Cruz to Ermita) * Line 1 (Carriedo Station to Central Station) * Quezon Bridge (Quiapo to Ermita) * Ayala Bridge (San Miguel to Ermita) * Mabini Bridge - formerly called Nagtahan Bridge (Sta. Mesa to Pandacan) *Philippine National Railways (Santa Mesa Station to Pandacan Station) * Padre Zamora Bridge formerly called Pandacan Bridge (Sta.Mesa to Pandacan) * Lambingan Bridge (Sta. Ana) * Makati-Mandaluyong Bridge * Line 3 (Boni station to Guadalupe Station) * Guadalupe Bridge (Makati to Mandaluyong) * C.P. Garcia Bridge (Makati to Pasig) * Kaunlaran Bridge (Pasig) * Bambang Bridge (Pasig) * Kalawaan Bridge (Pasig) * Napindan Bridge (Pasig to Taguig) Two new bridges are under construction: * Binondo\u2013Intramuros Bridge * BGC-Ortigas Link Bridge * Estrella\u2013Pantaleon Bridge (reconstruction) ====Marikina River Bridges==== The bridges listed below are those located in Metro Manila crossing the Marikina River (listed towards the confluence with the Pasig River in a north to south order): * Batasan-San Mateo Bridge (Quezon City to San Mateo, Rizal) * Gil Fernando Bridge (Marikina) * A. Bonifacio Bridge (Marikina) * Marcos Bridge (Marikina) * Line 2 (Santolan Station to Katipunan Station) * Diosdado Macapagal Bridge (Quezon City to Marikina) * Caruncho Bridge (Quezon City to Pasig) * Rosario Bridge (Pasig) * Sandoval Bridge (Pasig) * Kaginhawaan Bridge (Pasig) * Vargas Bridge (Pasig) * Sta. Rosa de Lima Bridge (Pasig) ==Public transport== Buses and jeepneys share Manila's roads. Manila, being a major city, offers various transportation options. The most famous of these modes is the public jeepney, which has been in use since the years immediately after World War II. Buses, air-conditioned metered taxi, and Tamaraw FX mini-vans are also popular forms of transportation. Auto rickshaws (referred to as \"tricycles\" in the Philippines) and pedicabs are used for short distances. In some areas, especially in Divisoria and large public markets, two-stroke motors are fitted in the pedicabs and are used for goods transport. Regardless of modernity, horse-drawn calesas are still used in the streets of Binondo and Intramuros. Buses, taxis and trains are also other important means of public transportation in the metropolis. The metropolis is served by the Manila Light Rail Transit System (Line 1 and Line 2), the Manila Metro Rail Transit System (Line 3) and the Philippine National Railways (PNR). More train lines are planned or under construction. Grab operates in Metro Manila. ===Jeepneys=== A Jeepney in Manila. Jeepneys are the most popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines, they have also become a ubiquitous symbol of the Philippine culture. According to the Metro Manila Dream Plan report by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a survey made in 2007 came out with 48,366 public utility jeepneys plying some 600 routes nationwide, with 61% serving the Greater Capital Region, which includes Metro Manila. In 2000, jeepneys and tricycles topped all modes of travel in Metro Manila at 46%, before light rail became popular, followed by buses at 24% and private vehicles at 21%.http://www.diva- portal.org/smash/get/diva2:22252/FULLTEXT01.pdf In 2016, the Department of Transportation and Communications imposed an age limit on jeepneys of 15 years, with older jeepneys starting to be phased out. Many jeepney operators oppose the phase-out, and politicians urged the government to drop the jeepney modernization program. As part of the PUV modernization program all new and existing vehicles must be fitted with a tap card system which allows commuters to pay for their trip. The system would enable journey details to be recorded and the appropriate fare deducted from the stored value on the card. ===Buses=== Aside from dilapidated jeepneys, public utility buses (PUBs) are the bane of Metro Manila's congested roads, due to their numbers, their sheer physical size, and the methods of bus drivers and conductors of loading and unloading passengers. On any given day, some 3 million vehicles pass Metro Manila's main circumferential artery, EDSA or C-4. Of the total, about 140,000 are buses, according to an article by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ).http://pcij.org/stories/too-many-buses-too-many-agencies- clog-edsa/ \"The boorish behavior of many public buses -- as well as the fact that far too many of them are on the road -- has gotten worse through the years.\" Figures from the LTFRB indicate that there are about 13,000 buses operating in Metro Manila run by 1,200 operators, about half of them using EDSA. In response to this, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) hopes to totally remove all provincial bus terminals along EDSA by 2019.https://www.philstar.com/nation/2018/11/06/1866356/mmda-eyes-total-ban- provincial-bus-terminals-along-edsa-january Metro Manila's bus routes are not numbered. They are mainly divided between inner and outer Metro Manila by the two busiest corridors, (C4) EDSA and C5. From the northern cities and provinces, buses use four main arteries: McArthur Highway, NLEX, Quirino Highway, and Commonwealth Avenue. From the south, city buses start from two major terminals, PITX and Alabang, which will soon see services transferred to the under construction Taguig Integrated Terminal Exchange. Going east, routes start from either Cubao through the Marilaque Highway (R6), or Ortigas Avenue (R5) to reach Antipolo, Taytay and the rest of Rizal province. Being the trunkline road, EDSA is used by more than 30 bus routes. In comparison, other arterial roads are serviced by one bus route or none at all (being serviced by jeepneys). There is one bus on Espana and Quezon Avenue (R7) from Fairview to Baclaran, while the university district in Sampaloc has two buses going east, using the same roads, Aurora Ave and Ortigas Ave, up to either Cainta or Taytay. There are no buses on Rizal Avenue (R9) in Manila as it is served by Line 1 to Monumento. On any given day, some 3 million vehicles pass Metro Manila's main circumferential artery, EDSA or C-4. Of the total, about 140,000 are buses, according to an article by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ). \"The boorish behavior of many public buses \u2013 as well as the fact that far too many of them are on the road \u2013 has gotten worse through the years.\" Figures from the LTFRB indicate that there are about 13,000 buses operating in Metro Manila run by 1,200 operators, about half of them using EDSA. In response to this, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) hopes to totally remove all provincial bus terminals along EDSA by 2019. Metro Manila's bus routes are not numbered. They are mainly divided between inner and outer Metro Manila by the two busiest corridors, (C4) EDSA and C5. From the northern cities and provinces, buses use four main arteries: (1) McArthur Highway with a central transfer point in Caloocan Monumento, the roundabout on C4 and R8; (2) NLEX with a transfer point at the Balintawak interchange; (3) Quirino Highway merging with NLEX to the central transfer point at the North EDSA common station, which also receives routes coming from (4) Quirino via Novaliches, Fairview and Commonwealth Avenue. From the south, city buses start from two major terminals, Baclaran and Alabang, which will soon see services transferred to the new PITX for the former, and the under- construction South Terminal Exchange at ARCA South for the latter. Going east, routes start from either Cubao through the Marilaque Highway (R6), or Ortigas Avenue (R5) to reach Antipolo, Taytay and the rest of Rizal province. Manila has many metrobus companies such as Erjohn & Almark, Baclaran Metro Link and AC Trans. These use old Japanese buses (especially Isuzu or Nissan Diesel) converted to left-hand drive while the prevalence of surplus South Korean buses (like Daewoo and Kia) which are originally left hand is also popular nowadays. New buses on the other hand are also now popular with the influx of Chinese-made buses. Being the trunkline road, EDSA is used by more than 30 bus routes. In comparison, other arterial roads are serviced by one bus route or none at all (being serviced by jeepneys). There is one bus on Espana and Quezon Avenue (R7) from Fairview to Baclaran, while the university district in Sampaloc has two buses going east, using the same roads, Aurora Ave and Ortigas Ave, up to either Cainta or Taytay. There are no buses on Rizal Avenue (R9) in Manila as it is served by Line 1 to Monumento. Franchised city buses are: *BGC Bus *Citylink Coach Services *HM Transport ===Intermodal terminals=== {| !

Line 1, which is the first rail line operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority, a government corporation, opened in 1984, making it the first rapid rail transport in Southeast Asia. It was followed in 1999 by Line 3 along EDSA operated by the private company, Metro Rail Transit Corporation, before Line 2 was completed in 2003. Together, these four lines run by three different entities bear the brunt of providing the metropolis with rail as a faster alternative mode of transport other than buses and jeepneys. More rapid transit rail lines are in the planning stages or under construction as of 2019. , there were two different rapid transit systems in Metro Manila: the Manila Light Rail Transit System, or the LRTA System, and the Manila Metro Rail Transit System, or the MRTC System. The Green Line (Line 1) and the Blue Line (Line 2) form the LRTA network, while the Yellow Line (Line 3) forms the MRTC network, with 31 stations on the LRTA and 13 stations on the MRTC. Four more lines are proposed and would connect Metro Manila to the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal upon their completion. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;\" ! Current line name ! New line name |- |Manila Line 1 !style=\"background:#;\"| |- |Manila Line 2 !style=\"background:#;\"| |- |Manila Line 3 !style=\"background:#;\"|Yellow Line |- |PNR Southrail !style=\"background:#;\"|Orange Line |} ====Manila Light Rail Transit System==== EDSA station Katipunan station. The Manila Light Rail Transit system, run by the LRTA, is one of the main railway networks of Metro Manila.http://www.lrta.gov.ph/ It has a total of 31 stations (20 in Line 1 and 11 for Line 2), over a total of 31 kilometers of grade separated track. Line 1 runs along parts of Taft Avenue, Rizal Avenue, and Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), traveling a north\u2013south route through the cities of Quezon City, Caloocan, Manila, Pasay and Paranaque. On the other hand, Line 2 covers parts of Recto Avenue, Legarda Street, Magsaysay Boulevard, Aurora Boulevard, and Marikina-Infanta Highway (Marcos Highway), in an east\u2013west route which passes through the cities of Manila, Marikina, San Juan, Quezon City, and Antipolo in Rizal. Although Line 2 has been part of the system, it is actually a heavy rail full-metro rapid transit line. Combined, the two lines have a daily ridership of 750,000. ====Manila Metro Rail Transit System==== Line 3 Train approaching Ayala station. The Manila Metro Rail Transit system is another railway network in Metro Manila, composed of independent railway lines not under the control or supervision of the LRTA or PNR. Currently it is only composed of one line, Line 3, which was completed in 2000.https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151958/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 This single line runs solely along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), one of Metro Manila's main thoroughfares. Line 3 has 13 stations along its 16.95 kilometers of grade separated track, on a north\u2013south route which passes through the cities of Quezon City, Mandaluyong, Makati and Pasay. The busiest among the rail lines, it has a daily ridership of almost 600,000. The system is set to gain a new line in 2021 with the opening of Line 7,https://ppp.gov.ph/in_the_news/mrt-7-to-be-completed-by-q4-2019-tugade/ currently under construction, which will run from the North EDSA common station through Commonwealth Avenue to San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. ====PNR Metro Commuter Line==== Philippine National Railways (PNR) operates a commuter line that serves a region from Metro Manila south toward Laguna. PNR, a state- owned railway system of the Philippines, was established during the Spanish Colonial period. It used to provide services on Luzon, connecting northern and southern Luzon with Manila. In 1988, the railway line to northern Luzon (Northrail) became disused although plans to revive the northern line (Northrail) have been proposed. Services on the southern line (Southrail) continued throughout the 90s, but were halted as a consequence of damages caused by typhoons Milenyo and Reming. After a short revival, services to Bicol from Manila were halted again in 2012. The national government plans to reopen the line to Bicol in the future. The Philippine National Railways commuter service line, Metro Commuter Line has two parts. Metro South Commuter run daily between Tutuban and Alabang.http://www.pnr.gov.ph/northbound- southbound-timetable There are plans to extend this service further south to Calamba with the rehabilitation of the rail line. Metro North Commuter run between Tutuban and Governor Pascual. The North and South Commuters combined, when fully rehabilitated, will have a length of 122 kilometers from Clark in Pampanga in the north to Calamba, Laguna in the south, and stop at all 48 train stations in between.

Several BRT lines have been discussed and proposed, all are pending approval. * Bonifacio Global City Bushttps://ppp.gov.ph/ppp_projects/bonifacio-global- city-brt/ * EDSA * C-5 * Quezon Avenue to Manila City Hall ===Point-to-point buses (express buses)=== Express point-to-point buses provide non-stop or limited stop travel along Metro Manila. As of 2019, there are 52 points in the GCR served by P2P buses.https://p2pbus.ph/ Majority of the routes are served by single decker buses with just two served by double deckers. ==Air transportation== ===Airports=== The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (IATA airport code MNL) is the main international gateway to the Philippines, located between Pasay and Para\u00f1aque, about seven kilometers south of Manila city proper and southwest of Makati. Terminal 1 only serves international flights. All foreign carriers operating in Manila use Terminal 1 except for All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, KLM, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. Terminal 2 (or the Centennial Terminal), opened in October 1999, is used exclusively by Philippine Airlines for both its domestic and international service. Terminal 3, opened in August 2008, is the home terminal of Cebu Pacific, the country's second largest airline. Its international wing houses the 9 foreign carriers not using Terminal 1. It also houses some domestic flights of PAL through its subsidiary Air Philippines. Terminal 4 is used by smaller aircraft of all domestic carriers, and by Air Asia as well. With a record-breaking 42-million people using the airport in 2017, NAIA has long breached the 30-million combined passenger capacity of its four terminals.https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/starweek- magazine/2018/11/04/1865536/uncertain-future-whats-next-naia A proposal to expand NAIA, submitted by a consortium of the country's largest conglomerates, involves the expansion of the current terminals and the construction of an integrated hub as well as a second parallel runway. There are also exploratory talks to transfer terminal assignments among airlines.https://www.bworldonline.com/no-changes-in-naia-terminal-assignments- for-airlines-by-aug-31/ Both NAIA and Clark International Airport, located in the Clark Freeport Zone in Angeles, Pampanga serve the Manila area, with CIA catering mostly to low-cost carriers that avail themselves of the lower landing fees than those charged at NAIA. In 2018, Clark handled 2.6 million passengers, all the while undergoing expansion to bring capacity to 12 million with the addition of a second terminal to be finished by 2020. ===Proposed airports=== In June 2014, JICA formally recommended the construction of a new airport in the vicinity of Sangley Point, Cavite City to replace the space- constricted NAIA. The recommendation involved the reclamation of Manila Bay to locate the new airport. This is contained in JICA's Metro Manila Dream Plan roadmap. Also, an unsolicited proposal by San Miguel Corporation, builders and concessionaires of the Manila Skyway and other infrastructure projects, has been considered by the national government. As of 2/2019, it has been approved by the NEDA pending a Swiss Challenge from other interested parties, as well as further environmental impact studies. The proposed aerotropolis will also be located at a reclaimed area of Manila Bay in Bulacan, Bulacan. (This is a current event; developments are happening fast along this issue.) ==Water transportation== Manila North Harbor. ===Seaports and piers=== The Port of Manila, located in the vicinity of Manila Bay, is the chief seaport of the Philippines. It primarily serves the city's commercial needs. North Harbor and South Harbor experience busy periods during long holidays such as Holy Week, All Saints Day and the Christmas holidays. ===Pasig River Ferry=== The Pasig River Ferry Service operates 17 stations along the Pasig River from Plaza Mexico in Intramuros to Pasig. The ferry service is the only water-based transportation that cruised the Pasig River. ==See also== *Metro Manila Rapid Transit **Line 1 **Line 2 **Line 3 **Line 4 **Line 5 **Line 6 **Line 7 **Line 8 **Line 9 **PNR Metro Commuter Line **List of rail transit stations in the Greater Manila Area * Manila Light Rail Transit System * Manila Metro Rail Transit System * Metro Rail Transit Corporation * Philippine National Railways * Public transport in Metro Manila * Traffic in Metro Manila * PUVMP * Transportation in the Philippines * Department of Public Works and Highways * Department of Transportation * Philippine highway network * Strong Republic Nautical Highway ==References== Category:Transportation in Luzon ",
