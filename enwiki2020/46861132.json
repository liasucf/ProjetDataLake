The goalkeeper was an unused substitute for Sosa in V\u00e9lez' 2012 Inicial, 2012\u201313 Superfinal and 2013 Supercopa Argentina winning campaigns.

Aguerre's first clean sheet was in a 2\u20130 victory over Boca Juniors, in which, according to the local sports media, he had an outstanding performance. With Fabi\u00e1n Cubero and Leandro Somoza injured, Aguerre also captained V\u00e9lez's young squad during the second half of the tournament. At the end of the year, the goalkeeper was selected as V\u00e9lez Sarsfield's best player of the year in a poll held at the club's official website. After the end of the 2016 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n, the goalkeeper was linked with Argentine powerhouse River Plate to replace Marcelo Barovero, although he ended up staying in V\u00e9lez.
