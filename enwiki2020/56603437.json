    "text": "Jonathan Anderson is a fashion designer and the founder of JW Anderson. Anderson has had success with a number of collections in recent years with his eponymous label and has also served as the creative director of Spanish luxury house, LOEWE. ==Early life== Anderson was born in the town of Magherafelt in Northern Ireland in 1984. He is the son of Willie Anderson, who played international rugby for Ireland between 1984 and 1990. His mother is Heather Buckley, who worked as a secondary school teacher. Anderson grew up in Northern Ireland, but spent a lot of time on the Balearic island of Ibiza, where his parents owned a house. He has since stated in interviews that the contrasting environments played a big role in shaping his sensibilities as a designer. At the age of 18 he moved to the United States in an attempt to become an actor. He was based in New York at The Juilliard School, but developed an interest in costume design rather than acting. He moved to Dublin shortly after, securing his first fashion-based job at the Dublin department store, Brown Thomas. Jonathan later moved to London, graduating from the London College of Fashion in 2005.https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/jonathan-anderson ==Career== Anderson began his career working as a visual merchandiser for Prada, working for Manuela Pavesi. He launched his own menswear collection shortly after in 2008. His first collection under the JW Anderson label received critical acclaim. In 2010, Anderson received sponsorship from the British Fashion Council's Newton committee and subsequently produced his first catwalk collection at London Fashion Week. The rising success of Anderson's JW Anderson label allowed him to secure a second NewGen sponsorship and led to a collaboration with high-street retailer, Topshop in 2012. The collaboration was a collection of limited-edition items, known as the JW Anderson x Topshop collection. It featured clothing and accessories ranging from mini-kilts and paisley prints, to Halloween motifs and included a range of stationery, iPhone cases and Rubik cubes. The collection sold out within hours of it launching. Anderson and Topshop scheduled another collaboration to launch a year later, with the release coming in February 2013. Later that year, Donatella Versace enlisted him to replace Christopher Kane at Versace\u2019s diffusive line Versus, where he showcased his first collection in June at New York\u2019s Lexington Armoury. In September 2013, LVMH took a minority stake in JW Anderson and named Anderson as new creative director for Spanish luxury house LOEWE. ==References== Category:Living people Category:British fashion designers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
