Sadan means non-tribal Indo-Aryan language speaker who traditionally speak Nagpuri, Khortha, Panchpargania and Kurmali. The Nagpuri as a linguistic and cultural identity is perhaps origin of early modern period. The known use of name Nagpuri was first used by king Medini Ray for Nagvanshi king Raghunath Shah. The name \"Nagpuri\" has been propagated by poets and writers. In recent years the native speaker of Sadri/Nagpuri language are known as Nagpuri in western study. == History == === Prehistoric era === Stone tools, microliths discovered from Chota Nagpur plateau region which are from Mesolithic and Neolithic period. During Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia. Several neolithic settlements have found in sites such as Jhusi, Lahuradewa, Mehergarh, Bhirrana, Rakhigarhi, Koldihwa, Chopani Mando and Chirand. At the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Kabra-Kala mound in Palamu district various antiquities, coins and art objects have been found which are from Neolithic to Medieval period and the pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to late medieval period. During the 2nd millennium BC, the use of Cooper tools had spread in the Chotanagpur plateau region and these find- complexes known as Copper Hoard Culture.Paul Yule, Addenda to \"The Copper Hoards of the Indian Subcontinent: Preliminaries for an Interpretation\", Man and Environment 26.2, 2002, 117\u2013120 http://archiv.ub.uni- heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/510/. === Ancient history === The use of Iron tools and pottery had spread in Chotanagpur plateau region during 1400 BCE according to carbon dating of Iron slag and pottery which have found in Singhbhum district. During the Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in northern India. Parts of western India was dominated by tribes who had a slightly different culture, considered non-Vedic by the mainstream Vedic culture prevailing in the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms. Similarly, there were some tribes in the eastern regions of India considered to be in this category. There were many kingdom existing in the north such as Madra, Salva and in the east such as Kikata, Nishadas who were not following Vedic religion. Around \u20131000 BCE, Vedic Aryans spread eastward to the fertile western Ganges Plain and adopted iron tools which allowed for clearing of forest and the adoption of a more settled, agricultural way of life. During this time, the central Ganges Plain dominated by a related but non-Vedic Indo-Aryan culture. The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of cities and large states (called mahajanapadas) as well as \u015brama\u1e47a movements (including Jainism and Buddhism) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy. According to Bronkhorst, the sramana culture arose in greater Magadha, which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. These Sramana religions did not worship the Vedic deities, practiced some form of asceticism and meditation (jhana) and tended to construct round burial mounds (called stupas in Buddhism).Bronkorst, J; Greater Magadha: Studies in the Culture of Early India (2007), p. 3 Some parts of Nagpuri speaking region was part of Magadha Mahajanpada. Magadha and other Mahajanapadas in the Post Vedic period In Mauryan period, this region ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign (c. 232 BCE). Samudragupta, while marching through the present- day Chotanagpur region, directed the attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley. Gupta Empire === Early modern period (c. 1526 - c. 1858) === During medivial period Nagvanshi and Chero were ruling this region. During region of Akbar, the Mughal invaded Khukhragarh, then Nagvanshi rulers became vassal of Mughals. Nagvanshi were independent during weak Mughal rule. After the Battle of Plassey, the region comes under influence of East India Company. Chero and Nagvanshi ruler then became tributaries to East India company. Navratangarh fort Bakhtar Say and Mundal Singh, two landowners from Gumla, fought against the British East India company in 1812 against tax imposition on farmers. British hanged them in Kolkata. The other princely states in Chota Nagpur Plateau, came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary States of East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States.http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.100009/231191 ===Modern Period (after c. 1850 CE)=== The brothers Nilamber and Pitamber were chiefs of Bhogta clan of the Kharwar tribe, who held ancestral jagirs led the revolt against British East India company in 1857.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria. === Post-independence === After Indian independence in 1947, the rulers of the states chose to accede to the Dominion of India. Changbhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja and Udaipur later became part of Madhya Pradesh state, but Gangpur and Bonai became part of Orissa state, and Kharsawan and Saraikela part of Bihar state.Eastern States Agency.

It is sometimes considered hindi dialect. Nagpuri belongs to Bihari group of Indo-Aryan languages. According to professor Keshri Kumar Singh, Nagpuri is descendant of Magadhi Prakrit. According to Dr. Sravan Kumar Goswami, Nagpuri had evolved from Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. Its literary tradition started around the 17th century. It was lingua-franca in the region.Brass Paul R., The Politics of India Since Independence, Cambridge University Press, pp. 183 The Nagvanshi king Raghunath Shah and King of Ramgarh, Dalel Singh were poet. Hanuman Singh, Jaigovind Mishra, Barju Ram, Ghasiram Mahli and Das Mahli were prominent peot. \"Nagvanshavali\" written by Beniram Mehta is a historical work in Nagpuri language.

Prior to marriage, the boy\u2019s relatives go to girl\u2019s home to see and negotiate for marriage and token amount is paid by the boy\u2019s family to the girl\u2019s family as part of the marriage expenses called damgani. The process of marriage starts with giving of Sari by boy's family to girl's family. Damgani, panbandhi, matikoran (worship of gramadevata), madwa and dalhardi, nahchhur, amba biha, painkotan, baraat, pairghani, sindoor dan (Vermilion giving), harin marek (hunting deer), chuman (giving gifts), etc are the activities and rituals of marriage accompanied by music of Nagara, Dhak and Shehnai played by traditionally musicians of Ghasi community.

People reverence ancestors Mata and Pita. Other deities are Gram deoti(village deity), Bar Pahari(hill deity) and Gaurea(Cattle deity) etc. The people worship these deities at home themselves during festivals. In home, rituals performed by head of family and in community festival the rituals performed by village priest \"Pahan\" and his assistant \"Pujar\". It appears that nagpuri religious tradition is based on local folk tradition and of non-vedic and non-brahminical Indo European origin. The Vedic religion and Brahmanism influence reached in the region after arrival of Brahmin perhaps during rule of Maurya Empire. The Nagvanshi rulers constructed several temples during their reign and invited Brahmin from different parts of the country for priestly duty. == Notable people == *Jay Prakash Singh Bhogta, M.L.A from Chatra *Satyanand Bhogta, Former Agriculture minister of Jharkhand *Ram Tahal Choudhary, former Member of Parliament *Ganesh Ganjhu, M.L.A from Simaria *Deepika Kumari, International Archer *Ghasiram Mahli, Poet *Mukund Nayak, folk artist *Nandlal Nayak, Music composer *Nikki Pradhan, Field hockey player *Pushpa Pradhan, Field hockey player *Vimla Pradhan, Former Social welfare and tourism minister of Jharkhand *Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, MP of Rajya sabha *Shiv Prasad Sahu, former Member of Parliament *Bakhtar Say, freedom fighter *Raghunath Shah, Nagvanshi king and poet *Ani Nath Shahdeo, King of Barkagarh *Gopal Sharan Nath Shahdeo, Prince and former M.L.A from Hatia *Lal Chintamani Sharan Nath Shahdeo, Last Nagvanshi king *Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo, Jurist and Political activist *Lal Ranvijay Nath Shahdeo, Lawyer, writer, poet and political activist *Lal Vijay Shahdeo, director *Vishwanath Shahdeo, Freedom fighter in 1857 rebellion *Mundal Singh, freedom fighter *Rameswar Teli, Politician from Assam ==Notes== == References == ==External links== Category:Indo-Aryan peoples Category:Ethnic groups in India Category:Ethnic groups in Jharkhand ",
