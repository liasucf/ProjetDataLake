It is an off-shoot of its sister channel GameTV, focused on programming relating to fantasy sports, sports betting (including programming simulcast from VSIN), Esports, outdoor recreation, poker, and other competition and sports entertainment programming. ==History== The channel's origins begin in January 2013, when Anthem Media's subsidiary, Fight Media, was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called \"The League \u2013 Fantasy Sports TV,\" described as \"a national, English-language specialty Category B service devoted to fantasy sports, allowing viewers to act as owners and assume all the responsibilities associated with operating real sports franchises, and allowing viewers to create, monitor, trade and discuss players on their teams with others also playing fantasy sports.\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-7 CRTC 2013-01-09 In February 2013, Anthem acquired two fantasy sports analysis websites\u2014RotoExperts and SportsGrid\u2014to bolster content for the network. In March 2013, Anthem CEO Leonard Asper told the Toronto Star that the channel was expected to launch that September. He defended the network's concept by noting that \"people thought 'How can there be an entire channel devoted to golf?' But now the Golf Channel is in 82 million homes\", and that advertisers \"leapt out of their chairs\" when they learned that the network could appeal to both the traditional \"baby boomer\" demographic associated with fantasy sports, and the young male demographic that had also increasingly shown interest in fantasy.

In 2018, Anthem sold the FNTSY Sports Network brand and associated fantasy sports properties to a newly created company called SportsGrid Inc. It retained, however, the television distribution network on Canadian and American television service providers, and maintained the FNTSY Sports Network brand through a transitional licensing agreement until April 1, 2019 when it rebranded the channel as Game+. Plans to rebrand the channel were initially revealed through Anthem's licence renewal application for the channel with the CRTC. Anthem had noted in the application that it had difficulties gaining distribution for the channel as a newly- created service and decided to rebrand the network. Anthem partnered with Vegas Stats & Information Network to syndicate A Numbers Game and a weekly highlights program on Game+. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Anthem Sports & Entertainment Category:Television channels and stations established in 2014 Category:English-language television stations in Canada Category:2014 establishments in Canada ",
