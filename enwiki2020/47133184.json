There is an oblique-triangular rosy-fuscous spot on the middle of the costa, with four or five suffused oblique strigulae between this and the apex. A rosy-brownish linear dot with two or three black scales is found just above the dorsum before the tornus, and one or two others in the disc posteriorly. There is also a slight blackish dot on the termen beneath the apex. The hindwings are grey, thinly scaled and subhyaline (almost glass like) towards the base, the apex suffused light brownish. ==References== Category:Chelariini Category:Moths described in 1927 ",
