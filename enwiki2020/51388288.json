At the end of his basic training, he was sent to his displeasure for a Squadron Commanders Course in Shivta , which he completed as an outstanding Company trainee and even remained as an instructor. At the end of the Officers Academy which he then proceeded to, he returned to serve as a Platoon Commander at the Squadron Commanders Course and when asked to sign for permanent service, he asked for and even conditioned it on moving to the Paratroopers' Brigade . His request was accepted and he served as a Platoon commander and Deputy Company Commander in the Parachuted Nahal Battalion, the 50th Battalion and eight months later was appointed Company Commander . In the Six Day War, Yair served as the Hod (Spearhead) company commander who were first to break into the Rafah tensions, at the head of the 50th Battalion which led the Paratroopers' Brigade, under the command of Raful. Yair, fought at the head of his company and managed with his one half-track with ten soldiers on, to break through about a mile and a half into the heart of the compound, fighting hundreds of enemy soldiers. Their progress was halted, when, the half-track was hit and exploded and three of the ten soldiers, killed and the rest wounded, Yair was severely wounded but fought along his soldiers in the Egyptian soldiers attacking them. His rescue from the battlefield took place many hours later. In 1968, he began his academic studies and chose the psychology track. In 1971, he completed his undergraduate studies and began his master's degree studies. In the same year, he returned to active service and was an instructor in the IDF Officer Candidate School. In this role, he identified the main issue of the Officers Academy and which was a dropout rate of over 50% of the cadets in the school and chose to serve as the Officers Academy psychologist. As the school's psychologist, he invented and developed the system for the sorting and formation of the cadets at the entrance to the academy. At a later stage, his method was transferred to the Paratroopers Brigade and the various patrols. Since then, Yair's system has been used as the IDF's sorting system for admission to elite units. In 1972, Yair returned to the Paratroopers' Brigade and was appointed Deputy Commander of the Parachuted Nahal Battalion until August 1973 when he left for the Inter-Armed College of Command and Staff. In October 1973, with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, Yair was a Major ranked student at The Inter-Armed College of Command and Staff. On the morning of Yom Kippur, he was asked by the commander of the Paratroopers Brigade to go back to the 50th Battalion, whose soldiers were manning the border outposts, in the southern half of the Golan Heights. Yair was sent to serve as a Deputy Commander of the 50th Battalion. The battalion commander was wounded in a parachute training two weeks earlier, and Menachem Zatursky the Deputy Commander took his place. Yair arrived at the battalion headquarters at El Al, under the heavy Syrian shelling that opened the war. There it became clear to him that the connection with Zatursky and the operations officer who had both gone out into the field had been lost. Yair took command of the battalion. The battalion took part in the difficult containment battle against the Syrian offensive in the southern Golan Heights. Already on the evening of Yom Kippur, the southern sector was left without tanks in the face of the Syrian division's attack. At dawn the next day - Sunday, after the Syrians occupied Tel Saki and Ramat Magshimim and reached a range of from the battalion's headquarters, Yair was ordered to retreat with all the fighters at headquarters to the Sea of Galilee. Yair, orders his soldiers to retreat towards Ein Gev, while he decides to be left alone, at his observation post, located near the front line, watching the Syrian division preparing to resume its attack south-ways. Yair kept in touch with his fighters trapped in outposts inside the territory occupied by the Syrians. When the first reserve tanks arrived in the sector, Yair positioned them to stop the Syrian attack, which reached up to 700 meters from its position and was stopped. The next day, Yair led the second rescue attempt of the Tel Saki and post 116 fighters, and managed to reach the besieged and wounded and rescue them. Yair was able to recover the battalion that was badly damaged, with the help of his demand from the IDF High Command to allow the battalion to return and participate in the fighting. Yair crossed the Suez Canal and led at the head of his battalion the advance of the three armoured brigades of the Baran Division, against the Egyptian commando and outposts in the agricultural buffer zone along the freshwater canal and lakes. The battalion fought for more than a hundred miles, as far as the outskirts of the city of Suez. Yair was careful to make use of the battalion's advantages and conducted all the fighting in the Egyptian complexes along the tens of kilometres in infantry fighting, which surprised the Egyptians who waited for Israeli tanks with anti-tank missiles. In all the long days of fighting on the other side of the Suez Canal not one of the battalion's soldiers was killed. In 1975, Yair was appointed commander of the Company Commanders Course and was sent to the United States to attend a one-year Command and Staff course of the United States Army. Upon his return from the United States, Yair was promoted to the rank of Colonel and served as head of Combat Theory at the Infantry and Paratroopers Chief Division. In Operation Litani , Yair commanded a combined brigade battle team of two radar school battalions: the 906th and 17th Battalions and the 53rd Armoured Battalion, under the Infantry and Paratroopers Chief Division, Brigadier General Uri Simchoni. The forces, under Yair's command, conquered Tel Chalaaboun, Tel 850 and junction Chaff - al Hawa, killing 55 terrorists. Then, Yair founded the Anti-Missile Brigade, \"Hazi HaEsh\" Division, and was appointed commander of the Officers Academy. In 1981, Yair was appointed commander of the Paratroopers Brigade. That same year, as the Paratrooper Brigade Commander, Yair led two raid operations deep in Lebanon , in response to artillery fire between the PLO and the IDF. Yair commanded Operation \"Zilzal\" More than deep in Lebanon. In this operation, Yair's force had one man killed and seven wounded, and under heavy fire coming from all the hills and buildings around, Yair managed to rescue the force with the help of two Yasur helicopters, which returned to Israel with bullet holes all around. In the first Lebanon War, Yair served as the Paratrooper Brigade Commander as well. In accordance with Yair's proposal, the Paratroopers' Brigade made a vertical flank - an amphibious landing from the sea north of Sidon in the depths of Lebanon, about from the border, the brigade continued to lead IDF forces to the suburbs of Beirut. During the first three days, the brigade advanced and fought, detached from the rest of the IDF forces, moving from the direction of the Israeli border up north. The choice of the mountain axis - long, made in light of the joining to the Armoured corps forces, was supposed to delay the brigade's forces, compared to the advanced IDF forces on the short coastal axis, only towards Beirut. However, in test of time, Yair's decision was correct, and the Paratroopers were indeed the first force to arrive to Beirut and to join the Christian forces on the Beirut - Damascus axis. During the battles, Yair was lightly wounded. After the Sabra and Shatila massacre, Performed by the Christian phalanxes, Yair entered the refugee camp at the head of a group of soldiers to reassure its terrified residents. Following the distress among his fighters, who witnessed Sabra and Shatila events, Yair demanded to meet with Prime Minister Menachem Begin , and instead met with Defense Minister Arik Sharon.

In 1987, before graduating, he was called to the post of commander of the Lebanese sector, Division 91, when the IDF was inside Lebanese territory. In this position, Yair made a significant change in the planning of operations and activities in the sector, where instead of the initiative and planning of operations being carried out at the command and division level and from there to the battalions and companies, Yair decided that the commanders in the field would be the ones to initiate and plan the activities. This change has doubled the amount of activities and operations and streamlined them. Under his command, the division carried out about eighty operations and raids across the border.
