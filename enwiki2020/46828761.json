Portrait by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (c.1864) Charles-Auguste Sellier or, according to some sources, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Sellier (23 December 1830 \u2013 23 November 1882) was a French painter who specialized in mythological and historical subjects. Although not well-known during his lifetime, some of his works are considered to be precursors of Art Nouveau. == Biography== Lazarus Raised from the Dead (1857) He was born in Nancy. His father was a gardener. After being apprenticed to a house-painter, he was enrolled at the \"\u00c9cole des beaux-arts de Nancy\" from 1846 to 1852, where he studied with Louis Leborne (1796-1865), who arranged for him to continue his artistic education with a municipal grant. At the same time, from 1849 to 1851, he took courses in anatomy at the \"\u00c9cole Pr\u00e9paratoire de M\u00e9decine de Nancy\".Brief biography @ the Galerie Troncin-Denis. In 1852, he moved to Paris, where he found a position in the workshops of L\u00e9on Coignet and, later that year, entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux- Arts.Grunchec, P. (1985). The Grand Prix de Rome: Paintings from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, 1797-1863. Washington, DC: International Exhibitions Foundation. p. 158. . Two years later, he made his first attempt at the Prix de Rome with a canvas depicting Abraham washing the feet of the three angels. In 1857, he exhibited for the first time at the Salon, and won the Prix de Rome with his depiction of the resurrection of Lazarus.Grunchec, P. (1985). The Grand Prix de Rome: Paintings from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, 1797-1863. Washington, DC: International Exhibitions Foundation. pp. 112, 158. . Sellier's painting of Lazarus Raised from the Dead was a controversial winner, as its deep chairoscuro was contrary to the academic tradition; the critic Paul Mantz termed it \"a most strange phantasmagoria\" and detected the influence of Rembrandt.Grunchec, P. (1985). The Grand Prix de Rome: Paintings from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, 1797-1863. Washington, DC: International Exhibitions Foundation. p. 112. . From 1858 to 1863, Sellier studied in Rome at the French Academy, but made few friends and found that his work was not appreciated by Jean-Victor Schnetz, the Director. Normally very shy and reserved, he withdrew further into himself after his mother and father died within a few months of each other in 1863. After a brief stay in Paris, painting portraits, he bought back the family home and returned to Nancy in 1864, where he served as Director of the \"\u00c9cole de Peinture et de Dessin\" from 1866 to 1871. He died after a long illness. He bequeathed most of his works to the city of Nancy. They are now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts and the Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole. Streets have been named after him in Nancy and Houdemont. ==Gallery== File:Sellier-Angels.jpg|Two Angels (c.1870) File:Femme \u00e0 la perle 09739.jpg|Woman with Pearl (1875) File:Sellier-Leander.JPG|Leander ==References== ==Further reading== * Charles de Meixmoron de Dombasle, C.A.
