    "text": "Norway was represented by Kirsti Sparboe, with the song '\"Karusell\", at the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 20 March in Naples, Italy. \"Karusell\" was chosen as the Norwegian entry at the Melodi Grand Prix on 13 February. This was the first of Sparboe's three Eurovision appearances for Norway. ==Final== The MGP was held at the studios of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in Oslo, hosted by Odd Grythe. Five songs took part in the final with each song sung twice by different singers, once with a small combo and once with a full orchestra. However Wenche Myhre, who had been due to perform a version of \"Karusell\", had to withdraw at the last minute through illness so Sparboe sang both versions of the song. The winning song was chosen by postcard voting.ESC National Finals database 1965 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | MGP - 13 February 1965 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
