The higher the opacity, the greater the amount of cream present. Credit for the development of this instrument is given to Alfred Donn\u00e9 in 1843. The instrument was also used to measure the fat content of milk, but it gave inaccurate results. ==References== ==See also== * Lactometer Category:Measuring instruments ",
