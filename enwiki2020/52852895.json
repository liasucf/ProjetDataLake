For me intersex refers to the lived experience of the socio-cultural consequences of being born with a body that does not fit within the normative definitions of \"man\" and \"woman.\" In short, it is about our experiences and not a medical diagnosis.\" She has called for inclusion of the term \"sex characteristics\" in Dutch equal treatment legislation.
