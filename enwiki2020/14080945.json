Commissioned late in the war, she was initially assigned to transport duties and consequently did not participate in combat operations. Cortland was named after Cortland County, New York. She was launched 18 October 1944 by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; acquired by the Navy 31 December; and commissioned 1 January 1945, Commander F. C. B. Jordan in command. ==Operational history== ===World War II=== ====Sabotage foiled==== While Cortland was being outfitted at San Pedro on 5 January 1945, her watch apprehended beneath the pier a prowler who upon investigation proved to be a German spy. His avowed mission was to damage the ship with explosives which he had dropped overboard when caught.Cortland, DANFS Online. ====Training and transport duties==== Cortland completed her outfit and shakedown uneventfully and sailed to Seattle to embark Army troops, clearing 1 March for training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.
