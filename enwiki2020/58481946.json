    "text": "The Undertaker and His Pals is a 1966 American horror comedy film directed by T.L.P. Swicegood. ==Production== Location scenes were shot in Los Angeles and Glendale, California. ==Release== The Undertaker and His Pals premiered at Birmingham, Alabama on 30 November 1966. Originally, some gore scenes were created with the insertion of real medical surgery footage. When acquired by Ted V Mikels for a triple bill of the Italian horror movie THE EMBALMER and his own film THE CORPSE GRINDERS, he excised the majority of the gore scenes and a sequence with Ray Dannis in drag as an old lady. Reported in some sources as approx. 80 minutes, Mikels' cut of the film ran a little over an hour. It was released on home video by MTI Home Video and, since then, as part of many public domain DVD sets. ==Reception== \"Wied.\" of Variety stated that the film \"borrowed every gimmick from horror and macabre comedy films, with a resultant mish-mash which is difficult to appraise viewer-wise.\" From a retrospective review, Fred Beldin of AllMovie described the film as an \"incredibly weird horror comedy\", noting unfunny jokes and unrealistic gore with hammy acting but that the film \"revels in its own inappropriateness so completely that it's impossible to forget.\" and that it was \"highly recommended for those who revel in bad taste.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1966 horror films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ",
