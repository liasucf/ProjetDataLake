    "text": "The soundtrack for the 2019 Walt Disney Pictures film The Lion King, a photorealistic computer-animated remake of the 1994 animated film of the same name, consists of a soundtrack featuring songs from the original film written by Elton John and Tim Rice, and performed by the film's cast, as well as a new song by Beyonc\u00e9 and an end-credit song titled \"Never Too Late\", written by John and Rice and performed by John, and a score composed by the original film's composer Hans Zimmer. Beyonc\u00e9 also produced a curated soundtrack titled The Lion King: The Gift, which features new songs performed by multiple artists. The soundtrack was digitally released on July 11, 2019, while both the soundtrack's CD and Beyonc\u00e9's album were released on July 19, 2019. ==Background== On September 28, 2016, it was announced that Jon Favreau would direct a remake of Disney's The Lion King, which was announced to feature songs from the original film by Elton John and Tim Rice. On November 1, 2017, it was announced that the original film's composer, Hans Zimmer, who composed additional music for Favreau's Iron Man, would return to score the film. Zimmer initially hesitated to return for the remake, arguing that \"[he has] worked very hard to not ruin things through improvement\", however, he agreed to compose the remake after performing the original film's score in a concert, saying that he \"suddenly realized what [his] place in this new version was: to try a big experiment and use my band and orchestra, go back to Africa, work with Lebo and the chorus and extraordinary musicians from all over the world, and really make this a performance\". Zimmer treated his work on the remake similar to his work on the original film, stating that \"[He is] doing this strictly for the people for whom it means something. [He is] working [his] musicians to the bone because [he] wants to get that performance. [He wanted] to smell sweat and blood in [the] studio\". However, he also had a different approach on the score than in the original film, trying to \"rehearse and record the score like a live concert performance\". On November 28, 2017, it was reported that Elton John had signed onto the project to rework his musical compositions from the original film before retiring. The following day, it was reported that Beyonc\u00e9 would assist John in the soundtrack's re-work. On February 18, 2018, it was reported that four songs from the original film would be included: \"Circle of Life\", \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\", \"Hakuna Matata\", and \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", the latter being performed by Beyonc\u00e9, Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, and Billy Eichner. On February 3, 2019, it was reported that \"Be Prepared\" would be featured in the film as well. Favreau described the experience of \"not trying to create new songs but trying to build on what people remember and love about the old ones\" as something \"really fun and formative\". The score and the songs in the remake were influenced by the music featured in the Broadway version of The Lion King, as Favreau felt that \"[Zimmer and John] really [explored] further what the roots of the music are [in the Broadway show]\". Of the five songs of the original, the fate of \"Be Prepared\" was the one which was most debated when creating the film's soundtrack. Favreau felt that the original sequence, which he compared to the Night on Bald Mountain segment of Fantasia, would clash too heavily with the remake's tone and characterization of Scar. Favreau considered outright cutting the song and had screenwriter Jeff Nathanson create a spoken word monologue to replace the song, but was unsatisfied since he knew how important a villain song is to a Disney film. He asked Zimmer if any sort of musical version of the song could still be a part of the film; Favreau subsequently asked Tim Rice if he could update the song's lyrics to reflect Scar's new dynamic with the hyenas. Rice did so, and the final version of the song is a mix of the monologue Nathanson penned (from \"Mufasa has always shown too much restraint when it comes to hunting\" to \"the need for a diff'rnt dream\"), Rice's old and new lyrics, and new score created by Zimmer. Favreau opined that while it wasn't the full song, it would give the audiences the impression that they had still seen the sequence in the remake, and cited the final shot of Scar on a peak with a crescent moon behind him as a key image he had to keep for the film.Jon Favreau: The Lion King, audio commentary to the Blu-ray version of the film On February 9, 2018, John revealed that he, Rice and Beyonc\u00e9 would create a new song for the film's end credits. However, the collaboration between John and Beyonc\u00e9 did not pan out as their unreleased song was not added to the official soundtrack.https://www.thewrap.com/the- lion-king-elton-john-song-end-credits-never-too-late/ John and Rice wrote a new song for the end credits, titled \"Never Too Late\" and performed by John. \"Spirit\", the new song, performed by Beyonc\u00e9 and written by Beyonc\u00e9, Ilya Salmanzadeh and Labrinth, was originally intended for the end credits, but Favreau revealed that the song would be featured in the film itself. Favreau said that Beyonc\u00e9 \"wrote [the song] in the spirit of the production along with working with Lebo M., who's part of it with Hans Zimmer\" and felt \"it was nice of them to have them working with her to allow the new song to feel organically a part of the new production\". Zimmer later said he made the decision to move \"Spirit\" into the body of the film. \"Spirit\" was released as a single on July 10, 2019. The film also features a cover of The Tokens' \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", performed by Rogen and Eichner, as well as the song \"He Lives in You\" from Rhythm of the Pride Lands and the Broadway production, performed by Lebo M. Pharrell Williams would produce five songs for the film. The soundtrack, featuring Zimmer's score and the film's various existing and new songs, was released digitally on July 11, 2019, and physically on July 19, 2019. In October 2019, John heavily criticized the soundtrack, saying in full, \"The new version of The Lion King was a huge disappointment to me, because I believe they messed the music up. Music was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn't have the same impact. The magic and joy were lost. The soundtrack hasn't had nearly the same impact in the charts that it had 25 years ago, when it was the bestselling album of the year. The new soundtrack fell out of the charts so quickly, despite the massive box-office success. I wish I'd been invited to the party more, but the creative vision for the film and its music was different this time around and I wasn't really welcomed or treated with the same level of respect. That makes me extremely sad. I'm so happy that the right spirit for the music lives on with the Lion King stage musical.\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/elton-john- interview ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 35 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 5 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Albums (Gaon) | 12 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 27 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 95 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) | 89 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard) | 24 |} == The Lion King: The Gift == On July 9, 2019, it was revealed that Beyonc\u00e9 produced and curated an album titled The Lion King: The Gift, which features new songs inspired by the film, as well as \"Spirit\" from the soundtrack. Beyonc\u00e9 called the album \"sonic cinema\" and said that the film \"is a new experience of storytelling\", and that the album \"is influenced by everything from R&B;, pop, hip hop and Afro Beat\". Beyonc\u00e9 also said that \"[she] wanted to put everyone on their own journey to link the storyline\" and that the songs were inspired by the remake's storyline, which \"gives the listener a chance to imagine their own imagery, while listening to a new contemporary interpretation\". The songs were also produced by African producers, which Beyonc\u00e9 said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa. Cameroonian singer/producer Salatiel also features on the album. Some other African musicians featured on the album include, Ghana's Shatta Wale, Nigeria's Wizkid, Burna Boy, Yemi Alade, Mr Eazi, Tiwa Savage and Tekno. ==References== Category:2019 soundtrack albums Category:2010s film soundtrack albums Category:Albums produced by Beyonc\u00e9 Category:Albums produced by Elton John Category:Albums produced by Greg Kurstin Category:Albums produced by Ilya Salmanzadeh Category:Albums produced by Labrinth Category:Albums produced by Pharrell Williams Category:Albums produced by Stephen Lipson Category:Beyonc\u00e9 albums Category:Disney film soundtracks Category:Hans Zimmer soundtracks Category:The Lion King Category:Walt Disney Records soundtracks ",
