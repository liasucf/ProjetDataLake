    "text": "The following outline is provided as a topical overview of science: Science is both the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge through observation, experimentation and reasoning, and the body of knowledge thus acquired. The word \"science\" comes from the Latin word \"scientia\" meaning knowledge. A practitioner of science is called a \"scientist\". Modern science respects objective logical reasoning, and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the scientific method. == Essence of science == * Research \u2013 systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge. * Scientific discovery \u2013 observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences. * Laboratory \u2013 facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. * Objectivity \u2013 the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc. * Inquiry \u2013 any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem. == Scientific method == Scientific method (outline) \u2013 body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive. * Empirical method \u2013 * Experimental method \u2013 The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include: *# Conducting initial research and asking a question about a natural phenomenon *# Making observations of the phenomenon and/or collecting data about it *# Forming a hypothesis \u2013 proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. *# Predicting a logical consequence of the hypothesis *# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment \u2013 methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are: *#* Controlled experiment \u2013 experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable). *#* Natural experiment \u2013 empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment. *#** Observational study \u2013 draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator. *#* Field experiment \u2013 applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. See also field research. *# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of uncertainty. *# Draw conclusions by comparing data with predictions. Possible outcomes: *#* Conclusive: *#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data. *#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis. *#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. *#* Inconclusive: *#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are incommensurate. *#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion. *# Further steps include peer review and enabling others to reproduce or falsify the observations and/or conclusions * Deductive-nomological model * Scientific modelling \u2013 * Models of scientific method ** Hypothetico-deductive model \u2013 proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory. == Branches of science == Branches of science \u2013 divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. === Formal science === Formal science \u2013 branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems, such as those under the branches of: logic, mathematics, computer science, statistics, and some aspects of linguistics. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world, but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules. * Branches of formal science (also known as the formal sciences) === Natural science === Natural science (outline) \u2013 major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are among the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences. * Branches of natural science (also known as the natural sciences) === Social science === Social science \u2013 study of the social world constructed between humans. The social sciences usually limit themselves to an anthropomorphically centric view of these interactions with minimal emphasis on the inadvertent impact of social human behavior on the external environment (physical, biological, ecological, etc.). 'Social' is the concept of exchange/influence of ideas, thoughts, and relationship interactions (resulting in harmony, peace, self enrichment, favoritism, maliciousness, justice seeking, etc.) between humans. The scientific method is utilized in many social sciences, albeit adapted to the needs of the social construct being studied. * Branches of social science (also known as the social sciences) === Applied science === Applied science \u2013 branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, including inventions and other technological advancements. * Branches of applied science (also known as the applied sciences) == Types of scientific fields == * Exact science \u2013 any field of science capable of accurate quantitative expression or precise predictions and rigorous methods of testing hypotheses, especially reproducible experiments involving quantifiable predictions and measurements. * Fundamental science \u2013 science that describes the most basic objects, forces, relations between them and laws governing them, such that all other phenomena may be in principle derived from them following the logic of scientific reductionism. * Hard and soft science \u2013 colloquial terms often used when comparing scientific fields of academic research or scholarship, with hard meaning perceived as being more scientific, rigorous, or accurate. == Politics of science == * Disruptive technology \u2013 innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. * Kansas evolution hearings \u2013 series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, United States 5 to 12 May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. * List of books about the politics of science \u2013 list of books about the politics of science. * Politicization of science \u2013 politicization of science is the manipulation of science for political gain. * Science by press release \u2013 refers to scientists who put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the media. == History of science == * History of science \u2013 history of science in general ** History of scientific method \u2013 history of scientific method is a history of the methodology of scientific inquiry, as differentiated from a history of science in general. ** Theories/sociology of science \u2013 sociology and philosophy of science, as well as the entire field of science studies, have in the 20th century been occupied with the question of large-scale patterns and trends in the development of science, and asking questions about how science \"works\" both in a philosophical and practical sense. ** Historiography \u2013 study of the history and methodology of the sub- discipline of history, known as the history of science, including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development (\"History of History of Science\", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science). ** History of pseudoscience \u2013 history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time.
