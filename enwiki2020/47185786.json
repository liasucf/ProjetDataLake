It is known for publishing works of comic book authors, such as Roberto Fontanarrosa, Quino, Caloi and Liniers, in addition to publishing literary authors such as Rodolfo Walsh, Silvina Ocampo and Umberto Eco. == History == The publisher began when the lawyer Divinsky and his legal partner Tito Finkelberg joined with the editor Jorge \u00c1lvarez to open a bookshop. Not having the necessary capital for the company, \u00c1lvarez suggested to use the money (300 dollars) to instead buy book publishing rights. In 1967 de la Flor published its first book, the anthology Buenos Aires, de la fundaci\u00f3n a la angustia (Buenos Aires from the foundation to the anxiety), including short stories by Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Rodolfo Walsh and David Vi\u00f1as. In 1970, Kuki joined the publishing house. That year is published the first book of Quino's Mafalda Between 1977 and 1983, during the Argentinian military dictatorship, Divinsky and Kuki went into exile in Venezuela, for having published Cinco Dedos (Five fingers), a children's book considered \"subversive\" by the government. == References == == External links == * Official site (in Spanish) Category:Book publishing companies of Argentina Category:Publishing companies established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in Argentina ",
