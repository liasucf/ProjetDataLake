It is part of the Vo\u017edovac municipality and is a sub-neighborhood of the neighborhood of Vo\u017edovac itself. Built in 1930, it was one the earliest planned neighborhoods of Belgrade. == Location == The neighborhood occupies the northwestern section of Vo\u017edovac municipality. It is delineated by the elementary school \"Kara\u0111or\u0111e\" to the north, Vo\u017edovac Church to the south and by two major city streets, Vojvode Stepe to the east and the Liberation Boulevard to the west. \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija borders the neighborhood of Autokomanda in the north, Du\u0161anovac in the northeast, Vo\u017edovac in the east, Byford's Forest in the southeast and Dedinje, Diplomatska Kolonija and Stadion in the east. == History == === Origin === After the liberation in World War I in 1918, Vo\u017edovac was placed under the Belgrade's administrative rule. Despite economic hardships caused by the war, the growth of population in Belgrade experienced a boom. As much of the city was devastated, this resulted in very high rents. In order to alleviate this problem for their profession, both state and privately employed clerks formed the Clerks Housing Cooperative. In 1928, the cooperative purchased from the Belgrade municipality a vast lot of completely non-urbanized section of the Queen Maria's Suburb. Named after the dowager queen Maria of Yugoslavia, the inhabitants colloquially began to use name Vo\u017edovac which spread and was adopted as the official name. The large lot was located along the left side of Avala road, which was in this section called the \u0160umadija road and today is called the Boulevard of Liberation. It occupied the area between the Vo\u017edovac Church and the football stadium of SK Jugoslavija. === Design and construction === The Cooperative founders originally envisioned the settlement which would consist of several blocks of modern buildings, surrounded by the parks. This was quite popular at the time in the large European cities. The buildings was planned as the neatly packed, monumental edifices in the centers of large parks, with addition of \"all technical facilities which will contribute to the coziness of dwelling\". However, the members had different opinion so in the end it was decided to build small, individual residential houses. The land was divided in 299 smaller lots on which the settlement was built and the parceling plan was drafted in 1929. The area of the lots was from The parceling plan was work of \u0110or\u0111e Kovaljevski. It envisioned the formation of 10 residential blocks with houses and 2 smaller block for public usage. One was planned for the open green market and the other for the building of the Cooperative, park and children playground. The building of the Cooperative was projected as the center of the settlement's public life, including the ballroom, cinema and a library. A square was also planned at the entry into the neighborhood, but neither the building nor the square have been built in the end. The settlement in general was designed by the Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Jan Dubovy as a neighborhood of the residential family houses and villas with yards and green belts in between. Dubovy, in turn, based it on the garden city ideas of Ebenezer Howard. Other architects who contributed to the planning were Milan Zlokovi\u0107, who worked on the typified houses, and Branislav Koji\u0107. But, out of almost 300 houses, over 200 were projected by the Russian architect Valery Stashevsky and his bureau. Each proprietor was free to choose an architect, but some of the basic guidelines set by Dubovy had to be followed: hipped roofs (folded into the pagoda style), green exterior shutters (either wooden or metallic), windows with ventilation dividers (\u0161prosna), access staircase (bordered by the low bricked wall) to the entry doors, etc. As Dubovy was a staunch Modernist, general request was also not to place figures, pilasters, ornamental garlands and other classical decorative elements. The base of the houses were set at . Construction began in September 1930. Though the houses were considered villas, because of the economic crisis and the social and financial abilities of the investors, the projected houses are very simple and humble in architectural sense, but functional. For the most part they have no ornaments, but have protruded eaves and hipped roofs, mimicking the folk type of construction, especially of the ground-floor houses. Because of the \"green city\" ideas in the project, the houses are a bit away from the streets and from each other, so that they can be surrounded by the green areas and forested yards. Initially, only one house was granted a permit to be higher than the others. The house was owned by Milorad \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107, a chief inspector in the Ministry of Education. Special permit was granted by the city administration, after Dubovy allowed it. He did so because the house was located almost in the geometrical center of the neighborhood and due to lighthouse appearance of its tower. It was projected by the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Boris Fesenkov. === Later developments === In the 1980s began the upgrading of the villas, with annexes and upper floors being added. In July 1991 the neighborhood was placed under the preliminary protection, because some of the most important architects were behind the concept of \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija and \"because the establishment of the settlement was planned with unique urban concept\". By this time, only 83 houses remained intact appearance since the 1930s. However, this status was revoked in 1994. Because of the economic meltdown which followed the collapse of Yugoslavia and the ensuing wars, many of the old owners sold their houses. The investors began constructing new buildings, in different styles, which though formally have only one floor, are towering the old houses as the investors are not abiding either to the law or the projects and build whatever they want. Also, in order to obtain the largest possible floor area, the entire lots are urbanized so the gardens and yards are being destroyed. This way, the modern settlement is completely opposite to what was originally envisioned in the 1930s. By 2007 less than 50 original houses remained. == Administration == The original name of the settlement was \u010cinovni\u010dko naselje \"Vo\u017edovac\" (Clerks settlement \"Vo\u017edovac\") but was later renamed to \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija. \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija is organized as a local community, a sub-municipal administrative unit within Vo\u017edovac. The local community was officially named \"Dr Nenad Parenta\" in the censuses of 1981 and 1991, and then it was named after the neighborhood. According to the last census of 2011, it had a population of 3,867. == Characteristics == The settlement remains predominantly residential. The eastern section, along the right side of the Vojvode Stepe Street is occupied by the taller buildings from a later period. In some of the newly upgraded buildings there are small clinics and hotels. The Twelfth Belgrade Gymnasium is located in the neighborhood. The endowment of physicist \u0110or\u0111e \u017divanovi\u0107 is in situated in his house in \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija. Venues and facilities in the vicinity of the neighborhood include the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, the Red Star's Rajko Miti\u0107 Stadium and the memorial of the Topovske \u0160upe concentration camp. == See also == * Vo\u017edovac == References == Category:Neighborhoods of Belgrade ",
