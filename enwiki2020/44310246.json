    "text": "The Gumihorn is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, the highest point of the Schynige Platte ridge, located at the western end of the Schwarzhorn group. It forms a limestone tower, overlooking the valley of the L\u00fctschine. At , it is the highest summit lying west of the Loucherhorn. The Gumihorn lies between the municipalities of Gsteigwiler and G\u00fcndlischwand, in the canton of Bern. Although its summit cannot be easily climbed, two other slightly lower summits on both sides of the peak can be easily reached from the Schynige Platte railway station, hence allowing a 360-degree view of the region. The highest is named Tuba or Daube (2,076 m; to the north) and the other, directly above the railway station, is named Geiss (2,067 m; to the south). ==References== ==External links== *Gumihorn on Hikr Category:Bernese Alps Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Mountains of the canton of Bern Category:Mountains of Switzerland Category:Two-thousanders of Switzerland ",
