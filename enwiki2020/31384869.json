    "text": "Franz Keller in the early 1900s Wen Valley (German: Wental) is a typical dry valley of the Schw\u00e4bische Alb northwest of Steinheim am Albuch. Wen Valley is a popular recreation area and until 2009 it was popular for cross golf, parkour and bouldering, but this is since June 2009 as compensation for the erection of Essingen Windpark prohibited. Several signs indicate this. There are several remarkable limestone rocks, which were given names like sphinx, hippopotamus or deer rock. The valley starts near Bartholom\u00e4 and runs southward.
