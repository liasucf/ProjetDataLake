The son of Francisco L\u00f3pez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y de la Cerda and Mar\u00eda Meneses y Padilla. L\u00f3pez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was a knight of the Order of Santiago and Count of Pedrosa. He was married to Mar\u00eda de Salazar in 1636. For 16 years he served in the Spanish army, fighting in Flanders and Germany. In 1639 he was named Governor of the Captaincy General of Chile. During his rule, corruption flourished. However he liked the Jesuits and admired Fr. Luis de Valdivia, and he brought gifts to make a new agreement with the natives. In 1641 he held the Parliament of Quillin, in the Quillin River valley, with the toqui Lincopinchon and established the first peace in the Arauco War with the indigenous Mapuche people. Nevertheless, a year later the Spaniards began using the military to put down uprisings. At the end of his term he embarked on a Spanish armada departing from Callao, Peru on its way back to Spain. Although he lived to see his son born during the voyage, the fleet was attacked by an English squadron while within sight of Cadiz, Spain, and L\u00f3pez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was killed in this Battle of C\u00e1diz (1656), as was his wife and one of his daughters. ==Sources== * * * Category:1599 births Category:1655 deaths Category:Royal Governors of Chile Category:Counts of Spain Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:Knights of Santiago Category:Captaincy General of Chile Category:Spanish generals Category:Spanish military personnel Category:17th-century Spanish people ",
