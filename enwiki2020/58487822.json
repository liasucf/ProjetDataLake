After the departure of the crew of Argo, a storm drove them back to the Cyzicene coast at night. With neither the Argonauts nor King Cyzicus recognizing one another, each mistook the other as an enemy, and battle ensued. Abaris was then killed by Jason during the battle between the Dolionians and the Argonauts. : \"The captain himself [i.e. Jason], lord of the field and of the battle, sweeps over heads and bodies wallowing in gore, like some black storm over the deep; Zelys and Brontes and Abaris he leaves half-dead..\"Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 3.152 ' == Note == == References == *Gaius Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica translated by Mozley, J H.
