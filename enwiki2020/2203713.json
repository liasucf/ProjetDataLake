    "text": "Ten athletes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland competed in seven sports at the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Great Britain athletes were the fifth most successful in terms of overall medals (7) and tied for fifth in gold medals (2). The 7 medals came on 23 entries in 14 events. Two tennis players (one English, one Irish) also played in mixed team squads, contributing to a gold and a bronze medal. These medals are not counted as part of the Great Britain total. ==Medallists== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- ! Medal ! Name ! Sport !

The 100 metres and the 800 metres were the two events in which they had little success. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |- |Launceston Elliot |rowspan=3| 100 m |align=\"center\"| 12.9 |align=\"center\"|3 |align=\"center\" colspan=2|Did not advance |- |Charles Gmelin |align=\"center\"| 12.9 |align=\"center\"|3 |align=\"center\" colspan=2|Did not advance |- |George Marshall |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"|5 |align=\"center\" colspan=2|Did not advance |- |Charles Gmelin |400 m |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"|2 Q |align=\"center\"|55.6 |align=\"center\"|Image:Bronze medal icon.svg |- |George Marshall |800 m |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"|4 |align=\"center\" colspan=2|Did not advance |- |Grantley Goulding |110 m hurdles |align=\"center\"|18.4 |align=\"center\"|1 Q |align=\"center\"|17.6 |align=\"center\"|Image:Silver medal icon.svg |- |George S.

He defeated Traun in the first round of the singles competition, then teamed up with him for the doubles competition. Robertson was much less successful, losing both of the matches he played, though he was awarded a retroactive bronze medal by the International Olympic Committee as his bye in the doubles quarterfinals put him in third place in that event. Like Boland's doubles gold medal, Robertson's bronze is not counted as part of the British total because the two played on mixed teams. {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !First round !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=\"2\"|Finals |- !style=\"line-height:1em\"|Opposition Result !style=\"line-height:1em\"|Opposition Result !style=\"line-height:1em\"|Opposition Result !style=\"line-height:1em\"|Opposition Result !Rank |- |John Pius Boland |Singles |align=\"center\"| W |align=\"center\"| W |align=\"center\"| W |align=\"center\"| W 6-2, 6-2 |align=\"center\"|Image:Gold medal icon.svg |- |George S.

In the one handed lift, he easily defeated Jensen, who lifted only 57 kilograms. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Weight !Rank |- |rowspan=2|Launceston Elliot |One hand lift |align=\"center\"|71.0 |align=\"center\"|Image:Gold medal icon.svg |- |Two hand lift |align=\"center\"|111.5 |align=\"center\"|Image:Silver medal icon.svg |} ==Wrestling== Elliot was defeated by eventual champion Carl Schuhmann in the first round of the wrestling competition, tying for 4th and last place. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=2|Final |- !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank |- |Launceston Elliot |Greco-Roman |align=center| L |align=center colspan=\"2\"|Did not advance |align=center|4 |} {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" !
