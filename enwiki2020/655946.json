    "text": "Honkin' on Bobo is the 14th studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on March 30, 2004, by Columbia Records. The album includes 11 covers of blues and blues rock songs from the 1950s and 1960s, with one new song, \"The Grind\". The album pays tribute to Aerosmith's earliest influences and showcases a rawer sound, reminiscent of their 1970s work, when compared to their more recent commercial efforts. Honkin' on Bobo was produced by Jack Douglas, who was Aerosmith's producer on a vast majority of their 1970s output. The album sold over 160,000 copies in its first week, reaching number five on the Billboard 200. Honkin' on Bobo was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 11, 2004. ==Production== Honkin' On Bobo was recorded in Joe Perry's ranch near Boston, with the band playing only when they were in a good mood, as according to Perry, \"We wanted to do something we haven't done before and that excites us. That's what makes us want to do another record. Otherwise, we'd say, 'OK, we've done everything we can do, so why bother even going in again?\u2019.\" The album title was suggested by Steven Tyler, who heard the phrase somewhere and the band found it funny.AEROSMITH BLUES ALBUM INSPIRED BY BIKE CRASHES AND FUNNY PHRASES Perry also stated during a radio interview that \"We just know that it's a phrase that sounds... jazzish, nastyish, so it works for us.\" Many tracks on the album feature harmonica work by Tyler, including Little Walter's \"Temperature\" which was played on an episode of the House of Blues Radio Hour which was about the harmonica. A harmonica keychain was included with the limited edition version. ==Reception== Metacritic gave the album a score of 69 out of 100 based on 12 generally favorable reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album is the best the band has done since Pump in 1989, and that it cannot be called a \"blues\" album because it is a rock album. He called the album a \"surprise\" in that, even though the album's artwork and title are bad, it marks a return to Aerosmith. In his Blender magazine review of the album, Jon Pareles said that the band did their blues album different than most others because, instead of making \"respectable\" cover versions, they make quite unrespectable cover versions like \"You Gotta Move\". The album, to him, proves that Aerosmith can still rock. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly felt that the album didn't live up to what it should be because it is too loud, but some songs on the album are good. David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine wrote an article for the magazine comparing and contrasting Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo and Eric Clapton's Me and Mr. Johnson which also explored blues influences. He said that Clapton's album was mostly about pain, while Aerosmith's album was about sex and running away from lovers. He also considers Bobo to be a double-tribute album \u2013 one tribute to the original musicians and one tribute for 1960s blues-rock bands \u2013 and considers the album to be overdone, which is what Aerosmith is good at. ==Track listing== Per liner notes: ==Personnel== Per liner notes: *Steven Tyler \u2013 lead vocals, harmonica, piano on \"Never Loved a Girl\", backing vocals on \"Stop Messin' Around\", percussion, production *Joe Perry \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Back Back Train\" and \"Stop Messin' Around\", production *Brad Whitford \u2013 rhythm and lead guitar *Tom Hamilton \u2013 bass guitar *Joey Kramer \u2013 drums Additional musicians *Tracy Bonham \u2013 vocals on \"Back Back Train\" and \"Jesus Is on the Main Line\" *Johnnie Johnson \u2013 piano on \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" and \"Temperature\" *The Memphis Horns \u2013 brass on \"Never Loved a Girl\" *Paul Santo \u2013 piano, electric piano, organ, engineering Production *Jack Douglas \u2013 production *Paul Caruso \u2013 engineering *Jay Messina \u2013 engineering *Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering *Marti Frederiksen \u2013 production, mixing, engineering ==Charts== Album {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2004) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian Top 100 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|59 |- |Austrian Top 75 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- |Belgium (Wallonia) 100 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|44 |- |Canadian Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |Finnish Top 40 Albums |style=\"text- align:center;\"|35 |- |French Top 200 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|52 |- |German Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|32 |- |Irish Top 75 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|60 |- |Japanese Top 30 Albums |style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 |- |Netherlands Top 100 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|64 |- |Spain (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|48 |- |Swedish Top 60 Albums |style=\"text- align:center;\"|38 |- |Swiss Top 100 Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|17 |- |UK Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |US Billboard 200 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |US Blues Albums |style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |} ==Certifications== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Organization !align=\"left\"|Level !align=\"left\"|Date |- |align=\"left\"|RIAJ - Japan |align=\"left\"|Gold |align=\"left\"|April 10, 2004 |- |align=\"left\"|RIAA - USA |align=\"left\"|Gold |align=\"left\"|May 11, 2004 |} == References == ==Sources== * Category:Aerosmith albums Category:Covers albums Category:2004 albums Category:Albums produced by Jack Douglas (record producer) Category:Albums produced by Marti Frederiksen Category:Columbia Records albums ",
