On June 9, 1911, she became the first female to graduate from the Atlanta Law School\u2014as well as the first female to graduate from a law school in the state. Nevertheless, she was denied the right to practice law. In 1916 \"An Act to Permit Females to Practice Law\", otherwise known as the \"Portia Bill\", was signed by Governor Nathaniel Edwin Harris, and Hale was finally admitted to practice law in the state of Georgia. She became the first of the three female lawyers in Georgia, as Betty Reynolds Cobb and Mary C. Johnson were admitted the same year. In 1922, Hale was elected as the Vice-President of the Georgia of the Women Lawyers' Association. == See also == *List of first women lawyers and judges in Georgia == References == Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:American women lawyers Category:Atlanta Law School alumni Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
