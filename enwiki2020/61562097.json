Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Spain- Fiji diplomatic relations. == Economic relations == Until 2009 Fiji has benefited from the access of its sugar to the European market under the aid program of the so-called \"sugar reform\", whereby Fiji received preferential prices. It had a preferential price but substantially lower than the one in 2009 force until 2015. In 2009 Fiji signed a new Economic Partnership Treaty (EPA) with the European Union. It provides free access to surcharges to Fiji products to all member countries and in turn Fiji releases surcharges around 87% of products imported from the EU. Bilateral trade with Spain is very small. In 2011, Spain imported goods for \u20ac42,000 and exported for \u20ac1,309,000; that is a balance favorable to Spain of \u20ac1,267,000. In 2010 the balance has also been favorable to Spain for \u20ac232,000. The main items imported by Fiji are: intermediate products (75%) and industrial equipment (15%). The main item exported to Spain are raw materials (99%).Ficha de Fiyi Oficina de Informaci\u00f3n Diplom\u00e1tica. Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y Cooperaci\u00f3n.

However, the European Union provides assistance to Fiji through different routes: * Measures for Sugar Producing Countries (AMSP), estimated at 50 million euros between 2011 and 2013, although a large part of this aid is conditional on democratic evolution. * XX European Development Fund (EDF) and the Stability Instrument. * European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights that will aim to support the activity of NGOs. * Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed in December 2009 but pending implementation. Through the Forum Secretariat of the Pacific Islands, Fiji will benefit from $90.8 million along with fourteen other countries under the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Adaptation (ACSE) program.Ficha de Fiyi Office of Diplomatic Information.
