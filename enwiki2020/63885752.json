He served in the War of American Independence. He commanded the 80-gun Triomphant at the Battle of the Saintes, and died of wound two days after the battle. == Biography == Cheyron was born to a noble family, and brother to Pierre-Joseph du Cheyron de Saint- Vincent. He started his military career as a sub-lieutenant in the R\u00e9giment de Normandie en 1745, and rose to Lieutenant. In 1748, he changed his career and joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine. He was promoted to Ensign in 1754. He served under Admiral de Conflans, notably on Intr\u00e9pide off Saint-Domingue in 1760, and later on Guerrier and Tonnant. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1762. From 1766 to 1775, Cheyron worked on naval tactics and signals, and he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis in 1771. On 25 March 1773, he presented a memorandum to the Court, titled M\u00e9moire sur la tactique navale \u2014 Signaux de nuit et pour le temps de brume pour l'escadre du Roi. The report was favourably received by the Commission. He is considered one of the principal creators of naval communications before the era of radio. In 1775, he was brigade chief of the Gardes-Marine in Rochefort, and became major of the training squadron (escadre d'\u00e9volution) in 1776. In 1777, he was promoted to Captain. In July 1778, Cheyron was appointed to Orvilliers' squadron, and he applied his techniques during the Battle of Ushant. From 1779 to 1780, he served as Major in the French-Spanish fleet.
