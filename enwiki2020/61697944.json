    "text": "Kuk Sool Won () is a type of Korean martial arts. This Korean martial art is known for its comprehensive collection of combat techniques, in particular, it teaches an extensive set of offensive and defensive moves designed to take advantage of the human body's many pressure points. == History == Kuk Sool Won was founded in 1958 by In-Hyuk Suh, who also carries the formal titles of, Kuk Sa Nim (i.e. \"national teacher\") and Grandmaster. The founder later started the Kuk Sool Association in 1961 and moved to the United States to spread his system in 1974. In 1991, Kuk Sool Won was selected as an extra curricular activity for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and in 1992, Grandmaster In Hyuk Suh was presented with the Commander's Sword at West Point. == Technique == Kuk Sool Won relies on a historical perspective of traditional Korean martial arts when outlining its contents, which breaks things down into three main branches: # Tribal martial arts (\uc0ac\ub3c4\ubb34\uc220; Sado Mu Sool) # Buddhist Temple martial arts (\ubd88\uad50\ubb34\uc220; Bulgyo Mu Sool) # Royal Court martial arts (\uad81\uc911\ubb34\uc220; Koong Joong Mu Sool). Techniques from these three segments were carefully selected and organised into a cohesive curriculum in order to form the basis of Kuk Sool Won. This martial arts knowledge was said to be passed down to Grandmaster In-Hyuk Suh by his grandfather, Myung-duk Suh, who began teaching him at the tender age of five. But a more simplistic way to describe the contents of Kuk Sool Won would be to acknowledge that it is a successful combination or conglomeration of Hapkido (a derivative of Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu), Kung Fu (particularly Mantis style, although whether from the Southern or Northern variety isn't clear), and certain indigenous Korean martial arts (such as Taekkyeon). Note that combining disparate martial skills often yields inconsistencies which are difficult to overcome, yet this is not the case for the resulting foundation of elements found in the art of Kuk Sool. Kuk Sool Won is a systematic study of all of the conventional fighting arts, which together comprise the martial arts history of Korea. As a martial arts system, Kuk Sool Won is extremely well-organized and seeks to integrate and explore the entire spectrum of established Asian fighting arts, along with body conditioning, mental development, and traditional weapons training. The following list represents a short summary regarding the most common elements found in the system: * hand strikes and blocking / parrying * kicks and leg sweeps * body throws and grappling * joint-locking techniques * safe falling (i.e. break-falls) and acrobatics * various types of body conditioning * animal style techniques * traditional Korean weaponry * martial arts healing methods * meditation and specialty breathing techniques It is a form of self-defense which includes strikes, kicks, grappling, joint locks, as well as traditional weapons training and healing techniques. In Kuk Sool Won there are four basic sword forms that are taught (each with its own underlying set of principles, or gum bup \uac80\ubc95): * jung gum hyung - straight [grip] sword form - \uc815\uac80\ud615 * yuk gum hyung - inverted [grip] sword form - \uc5ed\uac80\ud615 * ssang jang gum hyung - twin long sword form - \uc30d\uc7a5\uac80\ud615 * ssang dan gum hyung - twin short sword form - \uc30d\ub2e8\uac80\ud615 {Note: both long & short twin sword forms include techniques where the weapons are held in either the straight or inverted fashion} == Attire == Kuk Sool Won practitioners don typical martial art uniforms or dobok (\ub3c4\ubcf5) for training. Although white being a common colour for the dobok in other styles, supposedly representing \"purity,\" all the uniforms in Kuk Sool Won are black in colour, which according to Korean culture is used to represent wisdom (note: white is also well known to be the colour for mourning). There are three types of uniforms for the members of Kuk Sool Won. The first type is referred to as a _training uniform_ and consists of a jacket styled top, loose fitting drawstring pants, and a long cloth belt that wraps around twice and is secured with a square knot. Patches that identify the system of Kuk Sool Won, the country where the practitioner lives, and other similar insignia, may also adorn this uniform. Regulations state that any clothing worn underneath, such as a T-shirt, leotard, or sports bra, should be black in colour as well. This training uniform can be worn by all members, whereas the other two uniforms are reserved only for those who have attained the rank of black belt. The first of the remaining two types of uniforms is essentially identical to the \"training uniform\" detailed above, but has a gold coloured fringe sewn along the bottom edge of the jacket. It is known as a _Black Belt uniform_. The last type of uniform is typically used for formal occasions, such as promotion ceremonies, test review gradings, demonstrations, exhibitions, etc. It is called a _General's uniform_ (\uc7a5\uad70\ub3c4\ubcf5; Jang Goon Dobok) as it was styled after the armour worn by military commanders in ancient times. Similar patches to previously mentioned uniforms are utilised and pants are similar as well. The top has fuller sleeves with bloused closures at the wrists and longish skirt- like panels extending towards the knees from the bottom of the torso; no belt is worn but this uniform is tighter fitting at the waist than the other uniforms listed, with the contrasting trim forming the outline of a belt. A military ascot or dickey is an additional item that is worn around the neck. While the General's Uniform is primarily black, there are various colour schemes with regard to trim striping and the neck kerchief, which identify the dan rank held by the wearer. Regardless of the colour, the kerchief sports either a logo motif insignia (3rd dan and higher) or a South Korean flag (1st and 2nd dan). Wang Sa Dobok \u2013 the wangsa dobok (\uc655\uc0ac, literally: King's Teacher, but was assigned to educate all members of the royal family) is to be worn solely by Kuk Sa Nim. It is gold in colour with [Tyrian] purple trim and belt (one might say the contrast colour is puce rather than Tyrian purple, but what's the point). The shoulders and back are adorned with large embroidered patches displaying one of 3 mystical beast motifs: a) twin dragons, b) twin phoenix, c) paired dragon & phoenix. In the chart below, each black belt rank will list its color scheme for the General's uniform, where the first instance cited will denote the trim colour, with the second instance denoting the kerchief colour. The wording KUK SOOL can also appear on uniforms other than those of KUK SOOL WON. Kuk Sool is a generic term despite longtime claims to the contrary. This term translates as \"national [martial] art,\" and therefore can be used by any martial art groups that are not linked to the World Kuk Sool Association, Inc. (WKSA), yet are still based on the same principles and techniques that helped to formulate this family owned martial art business. Surrounding all this contention, it is probably helpful to know a little about the origins of the Kuk Sool system. Sometime in the late 1950's to early 1960's, a movement in South Korea to help organize all the martial art systems that were not directly connected to Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Kong Soo Do, and other related arts, was underway since martial arts are heavily regulated in the Republic of Korea. The R.O.K. government had chosen to back Taekwondo as its \"official sport\" (primarily for the Olympics) but also had invested in a worldwide campaign to promote it outside of Korea. Meanwhile the aforementioned martial art systems which differed significantly from Taekwondo were seeking similar governmental approval to help benefit their businesses. Many of these arts were based on Hapkido, as it was fairly new to the public at the time yet immensely popular and so they convened to form a political body looking to get sanctioned, with detailed oversight to be taken care of internally. This newly formed political body was successful in achieving that goal, with roughly 30 groups or associations in all, as members. As already stated, most were based on hapkido but a few fell under a specific variant of hapkido, namely Kuk Sool. There were about four groups who cooperated together in solidifying the content of the Kuk Sool curriculum, and practitioners from these four groups were allowed to train at any dojang location (\ub3c4\uc7a5), due to the \"handshake\" agreement between these businesses {namely: Kuk\u00b7Sool\u00b7Kwan, \uad6d\uc220\uad00, \u570b\u8853\u9928; Hwa\u00b7Rang\u00b7Do, \ud654\ub791\ub3c4, \u82b1\u90ce\u9053; Kuk\u00b7Sool\u00b7Won, \uad6d\uc220\uc6d0, \u570b\u8853\u9662; and Bulgyo\u00b7Musool\u00b7Won, \ubd88\uad50\ubb34\uc220\uc6d0, \u4f5b\u6559\u6b66\u8853\u9662}, otherwise collectively known as the Korean Martial Art Association (Han\u00b7Kuk\u00b7Mu\u00b7Sool\u00b7Hyup\u00b7Hwe; \ud55c\uad6d\ubb34\uc220\ud611\ud68c, \u97d3\u570b\u6b66\u8853\u5354\u6703), or Kuk\u00b7Sool\u00b7Hwe for short(\uad6d\uc220\ud68c, \u570b\u8853\u6703). This unusual cooperation and affiliation was short lived, however, and eventually all binding ties between these 4 groups were abandoned. == Ranking System == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left; width: 40%; height: 200px;\" |+ !Title !Meaning / Rank / Colour Scheme |- |Kuk Sa Nim |Grandmaster (10th degree Black Belt) - wangsa dobok |- |Su Suhk Kwang Jang Nim |Senior Executive Master (9th degree Black Belt) - gold / gold |- |Suhn Im Kwang Jahng Nim |Executive Master (8th degree Black Belt) - red & gold / gold |- |Ji Do Kwang Jahng Nim |Senior Master (7th degree Black Belt) - red & gold / red |- |Joo Im Kwang Jahng Nim |Head Master (6th degree Black Belt) - red / red |- |Pyung Kwan Jahng Nim |Master (5th degree Black Belt) - red / white |- |Sa Bum Nim |Instructor (4th degree Black Belt) - red & silver / white (KSW-logo) |- |Pu Sa Bum Nim |Deputy Instructor (3rd degree Black Belt) - silver / white (KSW-logo) |- |Kyo Sa Nim |Assistant Instructor (2nd degree Black Belt) - silver / white (flag) |- |Jo Kyo Nim |Instructor-in- Training (1st degree Black Belt) - silver / white (flag) |- |Dahn Boh Nim |Black-Brown Belt -or- { Black Belt Candidate } |- |Ja Ddi |Brown Belt |- |Hohng Ddi |Red Belt |- |Chuhng Ddi |Blue Belt |- |Noh Rahng Ddi |Yellow Belt |- |Huin Ddi |White Belt |} == References == == Further reading == * * * * * Category:Korean martial arts ",
