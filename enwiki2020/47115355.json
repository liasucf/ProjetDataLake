He enlisted in the French Royal Army as a cavalry trooper in 1783 and served until 1789. He joined a Paris volunteer battalion in 1792 and became an officer. Sent to fight in the War in the Vend\u00e9e, he was promoted general of brigade and general of division within the span of nine days. His division ran away at both Cholet and Le Mans and he was reportedly drunk at the Battle of Dol, yet he was transferred in March 1794 to the Army of the North. In May and June he led a combat division at the battles of Grandreng, Erquelinnes, Gosselies, Lambusart and Fleurus. Removed from command in August 1794, he was thereafter assigned to posts in the interior. He led a division at Genola in November 1799 before being deactivated in 1801. Entangled in the 1804 affair of Jean Victor Marie Moreau he was placed under house arrest at Orl\u00e9ans and died there in 1808. ==References== * * * * Category:French generals Category:French military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:French Republican military leaders of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Republican military leaders of the War in the Vend\u00e9e Category:People from Saarlouis Category:1764 births Category:1824 deaths ",
