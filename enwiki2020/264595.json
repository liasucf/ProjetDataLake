Krifast opened in 1992 and consists of of road and of bicycle paths. The three main structures are the undersea Freifjord Tunnel, the Gjemnessund Bridge, and the Bergs\u00f8ysund Bridge. A total of seven bridges are part of the Krifast system, the most famous one being the suspension bridge Gjemnessund Bridge from the island of Bergs\u00f8ya to the mainland of Gjemnes Municipality, with high towers and a span between them of . There is also the long pontoon bridge called the Bergs\u00f8ysund Bridge which goes between the islands of Bergs\u00f8ya and Asp\u00f8ya, which is the only bridge of its kind where nothing but the ends are anchored to solid rock. The bridge is supported by 7 pontoons, floating on a deep fjord. The long underwater Freifjord Tunnel goes under the Freifjorden. It is reaches a depth of below sea level at its deepest point, though the bottom of the tunnel is in solid rock. A drive through the tunnel takes about 5 minutes. Because of the relatively steep climb, there are three lanes at each end, but only two at the bottom. Krifast was authorized by the Norwegian Parliament and construction began in October 1988. The government pledged to finance 39% of the expenses, the rest were to be taken in as toll on road traffic and car ferry fares (on the ferries to be discontinued due to the new tunnel and bridges). As of July 1991, the project employed 427 people, and spent daily on construction. Four years and NOK 1.1 billion later, in August 1992, Krifast was opened for regular traffic. ==See also== *Atlantic Ocean Tunnel ==References== Category:Roads in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Nordm\u00f8re Category:Buildings and structures in Kristiansund Category:Gjemnes Category:Former toll roads in Norway Category:Bridge\u2013tunnels in Europe Category:1992 establishments in Norway Category:European Route E39 in Norway Category:Norwegian National Road 70 ",
