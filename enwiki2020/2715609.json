The river Tisa flow between Banat and Ba\u010dka regions. ==Municipalities in Potisje== Municipalities in Ba\u010dka: *Kanji\u017ea *Senta *Ada *Be\u010dej *\u017dabalj *Titel Municipalities in Banat: *Novi Kne\u017eevac *\u010coka *Kikinda *Novi Be\u010dej *Zrenjanin ==History== Military Frontier in Potisje in 1745 District of Potisje (1751-1848) In the 1st century, ancient author Plinius used name Pathissus to describe a surroundings of the river Tisa. Because of the similarity of this name with modern Slavic name Potisje (meaning approximately \"a land around river Tisa\" in Slavic), which is a typical Slavic name used for surroundings of the rivers (like Podunavlje, Pomoravlje, etc.), name mentioned by Plinius might indicate an early Slavic presence in the area.Oleg Truba\u010dov, Etnogeneza i kultura drevnih Slovena, Beograd, 2005. (page 50) Between 1702 and 1751, the western part of Potisje (in the region of Ba\u010dka) belonged to the Tisa-Mure\u015f (Potisje-Pomori\u0161je) section of the Habsburg Military Frontier. Potisje segment of the Frontier included towns near river Tisa: Be\u010dej, Ada, Senta and Kanji\u017ea (in present-day Serbia), Szeged (in present-day Hungary), as well as other places in Ba\u010dka, including Subotica, Sombor and Sentoma\u0161 (Srbobran). After the abolishment of this part of the Frontier in 1751, many Serbs that lived in the region emigrated to Russia (notably to New Serbia and Slavo-Serbia). To prevent this emigration, the Habsburg authorities formed autonomous District of Potisje with seat in Be\u010dej. District of Potisje existed between 1751 and 1848. The three privileges were given to the district in 1759, 1774, and 1800. First privilege of the District defined its autonomous status, while the second one allowed to ethnic Hungarians to settle in the district. In the following period many Hungarians settled in Potisje and they replaced Serbs as a dominant nation in parts of the region. ==Ethnic groups== The municipalities with Serb ethnic majority are: \u017dabalj (86%), Titel (85%), Novi Kne\u017eevac (59%), Kikinda (76%), Novi Be\u010dej (69%), and Zrenjanin (74%). The municipalities with Hungarian ethnic majority are: Kanji\u017ea (86%), Senta (81%), Ada (77%), and \u010coka (52%). The Be\u010dej municipality is ethnically mixed with 49% Hungarians and 41% Serbs. ==Gallery== Image:Kanizsa2.jpg|Kanji\u017ea Image:Martonos2.jpg|Martono\u0161 Image:Novi_Be\u010dej_Orthodox_church.jpg|Novi Be\u010dej Image:Zenta1.jpg|Senta Image:Ada1.jpg|Ada Image:Peterr1.jpg|Ba\u010dko Petrovo Selo Image:Obecse1.jpg|Be\u010dej Image:Titel1.jpg|Titel ==References== #Potiska i Pomori\u0161ka vojna granica (1702\u20131751), Muzej Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2003. #Dr. Du\u0161an J.
