Kingsnorth explores the effects of global capitalism on English culture and character, highlhighting what he sees as a flattening of the country by development, conglomeration, and privatization. == Reception == Real England was Kingsnorth's first popularly successful book, garnering reviews in all major newspapers and citation in speeches by David Cameron and the archbishop of Canterbury. Writing in The Guardian, Nicholas Lezard says of the book, \"I occasionally say of a book that it is important, and that everyone should read it; this time I say so more emphatically than ever.\" Though Lezard notes that \"This is a very depressing book at times,\" Lezard highlights \"the urgency of this book, and the need for us to stop being complacent.\" ==References== Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:Books about globalization Category:Travelogues Category:British travel books ",
