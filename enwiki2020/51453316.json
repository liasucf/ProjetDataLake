    "text": "Basia on Broadway is a live album by Polish-born singer Basia, released in October 1995 by Sony Music. ==Overview== The album consists of 16 songs recorded live at the Neil Simon Theatre in New York City on November 24 & 25, 1994, during Basia's two-week concert run on Broadway \u2013 hence the album's subtitle Live at the Neil Simon Theatre. Of these songs, four were originally recorded for Basia's 1987 debut album, Time and Tide (\"From Now On\", \"New Day for You\", \"Promises\", and \"Time and Tide\"), with seven others from her 1990 release London Warsaw New York (\"Copernicus\", \"Cruising for Bruising\", \"Baby You're Mine\", \"Take Him Back Rachel\", \"Reward\", \"Until You Come Back to Me\", and \"Brave New Hope\"), and three from her 1994 album The Sweetest Illusion (\"Third Time Lucky\", \"Drunk on Love\", and \"Yearning\"). \"Half a Minute\" originates from the debut Matt Bianco album Whose Side Are You On? (1984). \"Dzie\u0144 si\u0119 budzi\" (English: \"The Day Is Dawning\") is a cover of a song popularized in Poland in the 1960s, and is the only track on the album performed in Basia's native Polish.
