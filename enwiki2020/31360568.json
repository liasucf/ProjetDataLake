    "text": "Edson Eli Monta\u00f1o Angulo (born 15 March 1991 in Guayaquil) is an Ecuadorian footballer who plays as a forward for the Ecuadorian national team and C.S.D. Independiente del Valle on loan from Aucas in the Ecuadorian Serie A. ==Club career== He had been playing throughout his youth at Barcelona and El Nacional. At the start of the 2010\u201311 season, he signed a three year-contract with the First Division-team KAA Gent. Monta\u00f1o\u2019s youth team, El Nacional, sold the 19-year-old attacker to KAA Gent at an unknown transfer price. The transfer gave KAA Gent, according to a press article of the team, the possibility to add a young promising player to the team. Monta\u00f1o plays as leader of the Ecuadorian selection and has been playing the international contest of players younger than 20 years in Spain (el Torneo Internacional sub 20 de l'Alc\u00fadia). On the ninth matchday, he was in the starting team in the game against STVV and by this, he made his d\u00e9but in the first team of KAA Gent. In January 2012, Monta\u00f1o returned to his native Ecuador to play for his old team Barcelona. On 25 June 2014, Monta\u00f1o signed for Australian A-League side Newcastle Jets for a year on loan. Monta\u00f1o made his debut for the Jets on 11 October and was unable to help his side as they lost 1\u20130 to local rivals Central Coast Mariners. Monta\u00f1o scored his first A-League goal in the Round 2 clash against Melbourne City, helping the Jet's to a 1\u20131 draw, courtesy of his emphatic finish. He retained his decent goal-scoring form scoring against the Mariners, Sydney, another against City, and an additional goal against the Roar in the culminating clash of the season. On 10 April, he scored against Melbourne Victory to give his side a 1\u20130 unforeseen win over the ladder leaders, Victory, a win that benumbed Victory supporters. This emphatic finish moved them off the bottom of the table. ==References== ==External links== *Monta\u00f1o's FEF player card Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Guayaquil Category:Association football forwards Category:Ecuadorian footballers Category:Ecuador international footballers Category:2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:C.D.
