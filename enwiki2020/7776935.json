    "text": "Weigeltisaurus is an extinct genus of weigeltisaurid reptile from the Late Permian of Germany and England. It has a single species, originally named as Palaechamaeleo jaekeli in 1930 and later assigned the name Weigeltisaurus jaekeli in 1939, when it was revealed that Palaeochamaeleo was a preocuppied name. A 1987 review by Evans and Haubold later lumped Weigeltisaurus jaekeli under Coelurosauravus as a second species of that genus. A 2015 reassessment of skull morphology study substantiated the validity of Weigeltisaurus and subsequent authors have used this genus. == References == Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Prehistoric neodiapsids Category:Permian reptiles of Europe Category:Fossils of Germany Category:Fossils of England Category:Kupferschiefer Category:Taxa named by Oskar Kuhn Category:Fossil taxa described in 1939 ",
