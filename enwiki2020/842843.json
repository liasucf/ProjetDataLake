    "text": "La Goulue (pronounced [la gulu] and meaning The Glutton), was the stage name of Louise Weber (12 July 1866 \u2013 29 January 1929), a French can-can dancer who was a star of the Moulin Rouge, a popular cabaret in the Pigalle district of Paris, near Montmartre.Philippe Le Moal, ed., \"La Goulue\", in Dictionnaire de la Danse (Paris: \u00c9ditions Larousse, 1999). Weber became known as La Goulue because as an adolescent, she was known for guzzling cabaret patrons' drinks while dancing. She also was referred to as the Queen of Montmartre.Maximillien de Lafayette, The Rise and Fall of La Goulue, part 1, Louise Weber, Queen of the Parisian Cabarets, 2nd ed. (New York: Times Square Books, 2011). == Childhood == Very little is known about her early childhood, but it is believed that Louise Weber was born into a Jewish family from Alsace that eventually moved to Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris. Her mother worked in a laundry. As an impoverished young girl who loved to dance, Weber is said to have enjoyed dressing up in laundry customers' expensive clothing and pretending to be a glamorous star on a great stage. At age 16, she was working with her mother in the laundry, but behind her mother's back began sneaking off to a dance hall dressed in a customer's \"borrowed\" dress.Michel Souvais, Moi, La Goulue de Toulouse-Lautrec: M\u00e9moires de Mon A\u00efeule (Paris: Publibook, 2008). == Early career == Moulin Rouge: La Goulue, a poster highlighting Louise Weber's work at the Moulin Rouge, by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1891 Dancing at small clubs around Paris, Weber quickly became a popular personality, liked for both her dancing skills and her charming, audacious behavior. In her routine, she would tease the male audience by swirling her raised dress to reveal the heart embroidered on her knickers and would do a high kick while flipping off a man's hat with her toe.Lucinda Jarrett, Stripping in Time: A History of Erotic Dancing (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1997). Because of her frequent habit of picking up a customer's glass and quickly downing its contents while dancing past his table, she was affectionately nicknamed La Goulue (The Glutton).Walter Sorrell, \"The Dancers of Toulouse-Lautrec\", Dance Magazine (New York), October 1953, pp. 28\u201329, 66\u201367. Eventually she met the Montmartre painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who introduced her to a group of models who earned extra money posing for the community's artists and photographers. Achille Delmaet, husband of Marie Juliette Louvet, would later find fame as the photographer who had taken many nude photographs of La Goulue.David Price, Cancan! (London: Cygnus Books, 2011). Henri Toulouse-Lautrec: La Goulue arriving at the Moulin Rouge (1892) == Star of the Moulin Rouge == Louise Weber was taken under the wing of Jacques Renaudin (1843\u20131907), a wine merchant who danced in his spare time under the stage name Valentin le D\u00e9soss\u00e9.Philippe Le Moal, ed., \"Valentin le D\u00e9soss\u00e9\", in Dictionnaire de la Danse (Paris: \u00c9ditions Larousse, 1999). They danced at the renowned Moulin Rouge in Montmartre when it first opened, performing an early form of the cancan known as the chahut.Francis Henry Gribble, \"The Origin of the Can-Can\" (April 1933), reprinted in Dancing Times (London), October 1990, pp. 53\u201354. The two were instant stars, but it was Weber who stole the show with her outrageously captivating conduct. Booked as a permanent headliner, La Goulue became synonymous with the can-can and the Moulin Rouge nightclub.Jacqeus Pessis and Jacques Cr\u00e9pineau, The Moulin Rouge (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990). The toast of Paris and the highest paid entertainer of her day, she became one of the favorite subjects for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, immortalized by his portraits and posters of her dancing at the Moulin Rouge.Henri de la Toulouse-Lautrec and Federico Zeri, Toulouse- Lautrec: At the Moulin Rouge, One Hundred Paintings Series (London: Nde Publishers, 2000). Her girlfriend was La M\u00f4me Fromage (The Cheesy Girl), another famous cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge.David Sweetman, Explosive Acts: Toulouse-Lautrec, Oscar Wilde, F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on and the Art & Anarchy of the Fin de Si\u00e8cle (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1999). == Decline == Having achieved both fame and fortune, Weber decided to part company with the Moulin Rouge in 1895 and strike out on her own.Robert Rey, \"La Goulue\", in Les Femmes C\u00e9l\u00e9bres (Paris, 1959) She invested a considerable amount of money into a show that traveled the country as part of a large fair; but her fans who had lined up to buy tickets at the Moulin Rouge did not take to the new setting, and her business venture turned into a dismal failure. Following the closure of her show, La Goulue disappeared from the public eye. Suffering from depression, she drank heavily and dissipated the small fortune she had accrued while dancing.Michel Souvais, Moi, La Goulue de Toulouse-Lautrec (2008).

She eked out a living selling peanuts, cigarettes, and matches on a street corner near the Moulin Rouge; few recognized the severely overweight and haggard former Queen of Montmartre. She died a year later at age 62 in the 10th arrondissement of Paris and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Pantin in the Paris suburb of Pantin, but later her remains were transferred to the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre.Cemeti\u00e8res de France et d'Ailleurs: Biographie et Photos, online: www.landrucimit\u00e8res.fr.
