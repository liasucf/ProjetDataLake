    "text": "The Munster Hurling Intermediate Championship is an annual hurling competition organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association since 1961 for the strong hurling teams in the province of Munster in Ireland. In some cases the teams consist of players who are not on the senior squads for their county (thus in effect, they are a second team), or in others of players who are from junior or intermediate clubs. The competition was established to prevent the stronger counties from dominating the Munster Junior Hurling Championship. The series of games are played during the summer months with the Munster final currently being played in July. The prize for the winning team is the Sweet Afton Cup. The championship has always been played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the series. The Munster Championship is an integral part of the wider All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship. The winners of the Munster final, like their counterparts in Leinster Championship, are rewarded by advancing directly to the latter stages of the All-Ireland series of games. The title has been won at least once by all six Munster counties, four of which have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Cork, who have won the competition 13 times. ==Format== The Munster Championship is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random \u2013 there are no seeds. Each match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn there is extra time and, if the sides still remain level, a second period of extra time is played. The format has remained the same since the very first Munster Championship in 1961. An open draw is made in which three of the five teams automatically qualify for the semi-final stage of the competition. Two other teams play in a lone quarter-final with the winner joining the other three teams at the semi-final stage. Once a team is defeated they are eliminated from the championship. The Munster Championship has wider implications for the All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship. The winners of the Munster final automatically qualify for the latter stages of the All-Ireland series of games. Unlike the final runners-up in the minor and senior championships, there is no 'back-door system' at intermediate level. Five of the six counties of Munster \u2013 Clare, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford \u2013 participate in the championship. Kerry, the sixth county in the province, contested the Munster Championship until recently. Galway took part in the competition in the 1960s. ==Trophies== At the end of the Munster final, the winning team is presented with a trophy. The cup, named the Sweet Afton Cup, is held by the winning team until the following year's final. Traditionally, the presentation is made at a special rostrum in the stand where GAA dignitaries and special guests view the match. The cup is decorated with ribbons in the colours of the winning team. During the game the cup actually has both teams' sets of ribbons attached and the runners-up ribbons are removed before the presentation. The winning captain accepts the cup on behalf of his team before giving a short speech. Individual members of the winning team then have an opportunity to come to the rostrum to lift the cup. The present trophy was presented by Tipperary man Jerry Shelly in 1961 to commemorate the new competition. ==General statistics== ===Performance by county=== {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | County ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | Wins ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | Runners-up ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | Years won ! style=\"background:lightgreen;\" | Years runner-up |- || 1 | Cork | 15 | 6 | 1964, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015 | 1961, 1962, 1968, 1970, 2000, 2013 |- || 2 | Tipperary | 9 | 7 | 1961, 1963, 1966, 1971, 1972, 2000, 2002, 2012, 2013 | 1998, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2014 |- || 3 | Limerick | 3 | 7 | 1968, 1998, 2008 | 1967, 1971, 1997, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2016 |- | rowspan=2 | 4 | Clare | 2 | 3 | 2011, 2016 | 1963, 2001, 2012 |- | Kerry | 2 | 1 | 1970, 1973 | 1972 |- | 5 | Waterford | 1 | 5 | 2007 | 1965, 2002, 2003, 2009, 2010 |- | 6 | Galway | 1 | 3 | 1962 | 1964, 1966, 1969 |- |} ===Biggest Munster final wins=== * The most one sided Munster finals: ** 24 points \u2013 1963: Tipperary 6\u201310 (28) \u2013 (4) 0\u20134 Clare ** 21 points \u2013 2009: Cork 5\u201324 (39) \u2013 (18) 3\u20139 Waterford ** 20 points \u2013 1969: Cork 4\u201314 (26) \u2013 (6) 0\u20136 Galway ** 13 points \u2013 2014: Cork 4\u201315 (27) \u2013 (14) 2\u20138 Tipperary ** 12 points \u2013 1964: Cork 4\u201313 (25) \u2013 (13) 1\u201310 Galway ** 12 points \u2013 2007: Waterford 5\u201312 (27) \u2013 (15) 1\u201312 Limerick ===Miscellaneous=== * Cork hold the record for the longest streak of success in finals.
