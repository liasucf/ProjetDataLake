He was the son of Vogeti Jaggarao Naidu and the grandson of Vogeti Apparao Naidu. He is well known for his long term tenure as honorary magistrate and municipal councillor at Rajahmundry. He was a wealthy landlord who owned more than 16 businesses at that time. == Early life == He was born into a very rich Vogeti Family of Rajahmundry of Meraka Veedhi Telaga family.His grandfather was offered to hold a vast tracts of land on his own and also get right on land attached to it to collect taxes as a zamindar, which he rejected and held the land on his own but was given the title zamindar. From then the family held the estates of Korukonda, Jambupatnam, Gummaldoddi, Kapavaram, Punyakshetram, Hukumpeta, Morampudi and also extensive landholdings in rajahmundry. He studied in Madras to complete his schooling which was later changed into Law College. Merakaveedhi Telagas had a very prominent role in the city as they were the Senathipathis and Samantharajus of Vijayanagar dynasty who came to Rajahmundry in the year 1757 after occupying the nawab fort of Rajahmundry serving for a century in maratha armies. Their family deity is Sri Venugopala Swamy and Vogeti family had already donated a lot to this Temple. For many years they are the trustees for the temple for many generations. they are Vaishnavas. From childhood Ramakrishnayya was raised as a Zamindari kid and was given respect for his behaviour. His childhood friends are Kanchumarthi Narasayya Naidu, Bayapuneedi Venkanna , etc. == Personal life == He was married to Subbayamma the Mother in law of Yerra Narasimha Rao, and the sister of Yerra subbarayudu the Musif of the District at that time and the daughter of Subedar Yerra Venkata Swamy and also the granddaughter of Subedar Major Sardar Bahadur Yerra Ayyanna.

He also acted as the justice of the peace, which gives the person judiciary power under the government that they can make their own decisions and pass laws instead of government which was a practise done in Zamindari system. == Social works == He worked a lot for the development of the city. He stood by the side of truth and strove to rescue many people from fraudulent troubles. . He also took care of Zamindar Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao when his adoptive father died in his very young age. Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh also studied with the help of Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao during the same time when he was under the guidance of Vogeti Ramakrishnayya. . Even Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao took the political hierarchy of Vogeti Ramakrishnayya. They had also started many rice mills with no profit for the benefit of people. == History == The ancestors of these Vogetis were the Senathipathis and Samantharajas of the Vijayanagar Dynasty. They came to Rajahmundry and settled there during 1754, when jaffer ali khan, the then nawab of Rajahmundry and Chichacole districts revolted against french general Bussy who convinced salabat jung, the then nizam of Hyderabad to possess northern sarkars(circars) dethroning jaffer ali khan. After the downfall of Vijayanagar dynasty in Chandragiri in 1652, last ruled by Sri Ranga Rayal, he was taken refugee along with his private council to bejapoor by shahji Bhonsle, father of the great Chhatrapati. Later in 1659 shivaji acquired behapoor and this private council thus entered into Mahratta armies and they continued in Mahratta armies. In 1754 when jaffer ali khan was dethroned he first formed allies with vijayanagar zamindar and later who withdrew his force to favour French who bribed him. Thus jaffer ali khan took the help of Mahrattas and they entered the country crossing ghats with 20,000 cavalry with the help of Bobbili Ranga rao. They burned down many villages of Vijayaramaraju of vizianagaram and also defeated him and plundered lot of wealth and stayed in Rajahmundry, and nawab used to live in Raja veedhi and there is Merakaveedhi is side to it where main body of Mahrattas camped, and later they lost to french and stayed few days longer and vacated. but a sect of families who are a close-knit clan and were descendants of governors of vijayanagar dynasty came back in the year 1757 after the Bobbili Siege and occupied the Nawab fort of Rajahmundry. Even now one can find swords used then. We can also notice that the people from these families call their fathers baba which is a Mahratta tradition and many more traditions can be observed different from all other telagas living in the country. Many names in these families are named after Nanaji, Baburao, Bajirao, and also many ladies were added with bhai. Thus they marry among themselves. Later they rose to power in the Military. They never wanted a Zamindari till 1784 when Nuzvid Zamindar Meka Apparao Naidu lost his Zamindari in Rajahmundry. Later in 1794, it was changed to Collectorate when Vogeti Apparao Naidu was given other estates to rule. Their Zamindari was considered to be one of the oldest Zamindari in Madras Presidency. these Meraka Veedhi Telagas have prominent role in history and politics. During mid-1800s in whole Rajahmundry there use to be only 1000 houses of which 64 belonged to Vogetis. == Death == He died in the year 1900 on which all the retail shop owners had closed their shops and gave condolences to the great soul.
