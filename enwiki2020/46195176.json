Most large country houses in Britain had a game larder,Bryson B. At Home: A Short History of Private Life (Random House; 2010), p. 143 and numerous examples built between the early 18th and early 20th centuries survive.A search of the National Heritage List for England on 22 March 2015 for monument category \"game larder\" gave 162 English examples. The structure also existed in other European countries where hunting or shooting game was popular, including Germany and Austria\u2013Hungary.Bunting M. The Plot: A Biography of an English Acre, ch. 8 (Granta; 2010) Game larders were usually situated near the kitchen. The usual English design is single storey, sometimes octagonal, and usually of brick or stone construction; ventilation is provided by louvred roof lanterns and louvred or mesh-covered unglazed windows. Some game larders had separate rooms for small and large game. A stone or slate floor helped to cool the room. By the early 20th century, refrigeration via cooling pipes was employed. Game larders were sometimes combined with other outbuildings, especially ice houses, as for example at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire and the Raith Estate in Fife. In central Europe, ice houses were themselves sometimes used for storing deer carcasses.Buxbaum T. \"Commercial Icehouses\" in Icehouses (Shire Publications; 2014) () Timber example at Audley End House, Essex John Claudius Loudon describes a small game larder in 1842: Game larder at Uppark, Sussex Rails or beams were used to support deer on hooks, with roof-suspended racks, sometimes on pulleys, for small game.Sambrook P.
