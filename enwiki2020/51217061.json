Birmingham Daily Gazette, 20 May 1926 ===Written as by Harry Colindale=== *They Want Their Wages (1925) ==Political career== Wilson was Liberal candidate for the Saffron Walden division of Essex at the 1922 General Election. At this election the Liberal Party was split between followers of H. H. Asquith and followers of David Lloyd George. Wilson was a follower of Asquith, but in Saffron Waldon, he was competing with a follower of Lloyd George and as a result finished fourth. By the time of the next election in 1923, the Liberals were united and he was the only Liberal standing in Saffron Walden. He increased the Liberal vote share but only finished third. He did not stand for parliament again.British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1973, FWS Craig ===Electoral record=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1882 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:People educated at the Glasgow Academy ",
