Ireland (Circa, issue 87, p.5), in the art journal Apex (issue 15, 1992, p.61, which refers to him as the artist from Leinstrand, Norway (\"aus Leinstrand (Norwegen)\"), in Nouvelles de l'estampe, a professional journal for printmakers which refers to him as \"the Dutch lithographer\" (\"Le lithographe hollandaise\"; Nouvelles de l'estampe, issue 195, 2004, p. 194), and in the Hungarian art magazine \u00daj m\u00fcv\u00e9szet, Vol. 17, 2006, p.13 (which says about his work: \" [\u2026] M\u00e1shol elszabadult mint\u00e1zat. pattern t\u00fa- nik fei, csillagjegyek bels\u00f3 rendje, egy hervad\u00f3 r\u00f3zs\u00e1ra hasonl\u00edt\u00f3 ov\u00e1lis alakzat (Angelo Evelyn)\" etc.). In the course of his career, Evelyn resided and maintained studios in Montreal (Canada), Bremen, Paris, Aachen (Germany), Trondheim (Norway), and Rotterdam (The Netherlands). ==Early life== Evelyn was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he obtained a degree in Physics and Mathematics at the University of British Columbia.\"Angelo Evelyn (Paes Bassi) \u00e9 nato a St.John in Canada nel 1942 dove ha studiato fisica e matematica presso la British Columbia University di Vancouver.\" See the publication Incontri con la Paleontologia, V Edizione.

This newspaper article in the Donaukurier referred to Evelyn as \"the Rotterdam painter, graphic artist and lithographer\" (\"den Rotterdamer Maler, Grafiker und [\u2026] Lithographen.\" \u2013 See also: http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx. From May 1966 to February 1967, known as Fred A. Evelyn, he was on meteorological officer training in Ottawa, Toronto, and CFB Trenton with John Gordon, Bob Clibbon, Brian Mason, Dave Philips, Alfred Warkentin, and David Hagborg amongst others. In 1969, he traveled to England. Upon his return in 1970, he briefly held scientific positions in Montr\u00e9al while simultaneously starting to paint as an autodidact.See: Nature-D-NatureD. Aachen and Rotterdam: Symposium Press 2003, p. 45. He soon moved back to Europe and Morocco, however, \"filling many sketchbooks with drawings and small paintings.\"Ibidem, p. 45. Returning to Montreal in 1971, he resumed his scientific position at McGill University. In 1973, he left Canada, settling down in West Berlin where he enrolled in the Free University of Berlin, earning his livelihood as a painter of billboards for major commercial fairs and exhibitions, while also applying for admission at the Berlin art academy.Ibidem, p. 45. \u2013 According to another source, he settled down in Germany in 1974. See: Keith Tribe, in: Angelo Evelyn. Gemaelde 1978-1984 Paintings (Bremen, Graphothek 1984), text in German and English. ==Art School== In 1978, Evelyn learned that he would be admitted by the Bremen art academy (now the University of the Arts Bremen but known at the time as Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung). Here, he studied painting and 3D design since 1979, obtaining a diploma in 2D design in 1983.\"Tra il 1979 e il 1983 ha studiato pittura e grafica presso l'Accademia di Design e Musica di Brema (Germania).\" See: Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [\u2026], ibidem. See also the respective information given in 1993 by the Canadian gallery Engramme: \"L'artiste canadien Angelo Evelyn \u00e9tudie entre 1979 et 1983 la peinture et la gravure \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie de Design et Musique de Br\u00eame en Allemagne.\" https://www.flickr.com/photos/engramme/4793465359. ==Career== Evelyn has worked as an independent artist in various countries of Europe after completing art school.Since 1983 he has worked and has exhibitions in Quebec, Western Europe, Scandinavia, and also in China (\"Dal 1983 ha lavorato ed esposto nel Qu\u00e9bec, in Europa occidentale, in Scandinavia, nonch\u00e9 in Cina.\") See: Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [\u2026], ibidem. See also: \"Depuis 1983 l'artiste a travaill\u00e9 et a expos\u00e9 au Qu\u00e9bec, en Europe de l'Ouest et en Scandinavie.\" Information provided by the Canadian gallery Engramme: https://www.flickr.com/photos/engramme/4793465359. Having obtained his diploma, the artist moved to Paris in 1983, renting a small studio and engaging in printmaking (using aluminum plates) at the Cit\u00e9 des Artes. The results of his creative work in Paris were presented in Bremen in 1985 in a large solo exhibition entitled Collage - Print - Stencil.See: Nature-D- NatureD, ibidem, p.46. === In Germany === In 1985, Evelyn moved from Paris to Aachen, Germany, a provincial town close to the Belgian and Dutch border, where he was able to rent a large studio. In the same year, he had an exhibition at the gallery of Radio Omroep Zuid in Maastricht (The Netherlands).Ibidem, p.46. During the next year, he exhibited \"in the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum\"< and had an important solo exhibition in the \"Neuer Aachener Kunstverein\", both in Aachen, Germany. In that year, he was also artist-in-residence at the Frans Masereel Centre in Kasterlee (Belgium).Ibidem, p.46. \u2013 Cf. During this period, he sought to reach perfection as a printmaker by taking part in advanced courses in printmaking at the Frans-Masereel Centrum and in other advanced courses, offered by the Czech artist Rudolf Broulim at the RHok (Royal Academy of Arts) Brussels,In Flemish, it is called RhoK \u2013 Instituut Beeldend Kunstonderwijs van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap; in Belgium, the two parts of the country, the French-speaking Wallonie and Flemish-speaking Flanders, each have their separate political and cultural institutions, distinct art academies, universities, etc. where he also had a solo exhibition.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p. 46. \u2013 See also Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [\u2026], ibidem, which noted that \"[...] ha approfondito le sue conoscenze di grafica partecipando a vari seminari avanzati tenuti da Franz Masereel presso il Kasterlee Centrum in Belgio, da Rijks Hoger Kunstonderwijs a Bruxelles [...]\". See also: http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx. In 1987, Evelyn was commissioned to do the stage decor for a performance by Tone Brulin's company at the Studio Theater in Trondheim (Norway). The work Evelyn was commissioned to do by Tone Brulin was for Brulin's play Turandot.\"'Turandot' av Tone Brulin. [\u2026] Regi: Tone Brulin. Scenografi: Angelo Evelyn. Studio Teater. 1985\", in: SCENEWEB, http://www.sceneweb.no/nb/artist/2111/Bj\u00f8rn_Myrholdt. It was noteworthy that an avant-garde artist like Tone Brulin would choose Angelo Evelyn for the job.Tone Brulin had been a pioneer of the experimental theater in Belgium since the 1950s. \"Perhaps the most important chamber theatre of the 1950s in Antwerp was the Theater op Zolder (Theatre in the Loft), later called the Nederlands Kamertoneel (Dutch Chamber Theatre). Founded in 1953 by Tone Brulin (b. 1926), the company had a particular interest in new Flemish authors...\", according to Toon Brouwers, Alfons van Impe, Jaak van Schoor, \"Flemish Community (Belgium)\", in: Don Rubin (ed.) , World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Vol. 1: Europe. London and New York : Routledge 2014 (paperback edition), p.119. (1st edition 1994). \u2013 \"Tone Brulin [\u2026] was one of the first, if not the first, to embark on bold new theatrical ventures.\" His \"experiments\" are described as significant. Paul van Morckhoven, Luc Andr\u00e9, The Contemporary Theatre in Belgium, Brussels : Belgian Information and Documentation Institute 1970, p.39. Tone Brulin is also mentioned by Mike Sell as an avantgarde \"playwright and dramatist\" (who gave workshops in the U.S.). M. Sell notes that \"Brulin's work in the theater was deeply influenced by the poor theater of Jerzy Grotowski and Eugenio Barba, which attempted to purify the form of the techniques and traditions that undermined global brotherhood by stripping theater down to its barest essentials: the actor's body and the cleared performance space.\" The American group that Brulin gave workshops for at Antioch College, Ohio, learned from him how to create \"true people's theater\". Mike Sell, Avant-garde Performance & the Limits of Criticism: Approaching the Living Theatre, Happening/Fluxus, and the Black Arts Movement. Ann Arbor, Mich.: Univ. of Michigan Press, 2008, p. 23. === In Norway === In 1988, Evelyn moved to Trondheim. Apparently, this was because Evelyn's Dutch wife Annie who had worked as an actress with the Cirque de Soleil, and who had performed in Brulin's Turandot, had obtained a job teaching Commedia dell'arte at the University of Trondheim (now the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) in 1987. The two rented a farm house in Leinstrand (or Tr\u00f8ndelag?) near Trondheim, where he established his new studio.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p.47. The years in Norway are marked by seascapes inspired not only by the sea as such. They also comprised ecological themes that echoed his awareness of the Norwegian whaling industry and the industrial traces of the North Sea oil boom. Others were apparently tracing memories of tales heard about his father who was a captain in the Canadian navy during the war, in command of one of those ships that protected freighters on their way from North America to Murmansk.Ibidem, p. 47. In both 1988 and 1989, Evelyn participated in the annual H\u00f8stutstilling, or Statens KunstutstillingSee: H\u00f8stutstillingen at the :no:Kunstnernes Hus or Artists House in Oslo, Norway which is described as the \"viktigste\" (most important) art exhibition in that country. He also received a large grant or stipend from the Norwegian government in 1989. In this year he had also solo exhibitions in Stavanger and in Molde (both in Norway).Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p. 47. === Norway and Germany === While in Norway, Evelyn returned to Germany frequently to organize his exhibitions, among them the big exhibition in Bremen (Lilienthal) entitled \"Bilder aus Norwegen und vom Kontinent\" (Paintings from Norway and the Continent). === In the Netherlands === He finally moved from Trondheim to the Rotterdam area in 1993. In the Netherlands, he had difficulties initially to find an appropriate studio, and got involved instead in a Hilversum artist cooperative, the Grafisch Atelier t'Gooi.Ibidem, p. 48. \u2013 The Grafisch Atelier t'Gooi, established in 1968 with support from the City of Hilversum, is one of the oldest \"open workshops\" in Holland specifically for artists engaging in printmaking. \"Open\" means accessible for artists who join the cooperative. (\"Grafisch Atelier 't Gooi werd in 1968 met steun van de gemeente Hilversum opgericht en is een van de oudste open werkplaatsen van Nederland.\") See the webpage of the Dutch profession journal Museumstijdschrift, http://museumtijdschrift.nl/artspot/grafisch-atelier-t-gooi/. ====Activities in Canada, Germany, Britain, etc.==== In the same year, he had two solo exhibitions in Canada.Ibidem, p. 48. And the next year, a group exhibition in the RHoK Art Academy in Brussels, together with two other artists, Niek Satijn and Erik Fliek, that was also shown in Hilversum.The group exhibition received financial support from the cultural section of the Canadian Embassy in Brussels, from the Province South Holland, the City of Hilversum, and the foundation Stichting Voorzieningsfonds voor Kunstenaars. In 1998, Evelyn founded an international print workshop (the Lithografie Werkstatt Eichstaett) together with two other artists, Li Portenlaenger and Armin Nischk.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p.48. \u2013 See, in addition Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [\u2026], ibidem, which has this information about the artist: \"Ha istituito nel 1998 ad Eichstatt (Baviera) insieme a due colleghi artisti tedeschi, uno studio internazionale della pietra litografica dove artisti tedeschi e stranieri vengono invitati per trascorrere un periodo partecipando ad un percorso artistico.\"See also http://www.lithos- jura.de/02werkstattE00.html , as well as the online version of the catalogue Blue Genes: http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx and see: https://www.flickr.com/photos/engramme/4793465359 which confirms that \"En 1998, il fonde un centre international de lithographie \u00e0 Eichstatt, en Bavi\u00e8re.\" Simultaneously, the three artists staged the event \"200 Jahre Lithographie\" in public space and the university as well as in the cathedral Notre Dame de Sacre Coeur in Eichstaett (from July 26 to Aug. 18, 1998).See: Helga K\u00f6nig (ed.; comp.), Vierzig Jahre Ausstellungen und Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen der Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Eichstaett-Ingolstadt 1964-2004, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Publishing House, 2004, pp.XX. In the same year (1998), he also obtained an M.A. in print-making from the Wimbledon School of Art (Wimbledon College of Art, Wimbledon nr. London, England).See http://www.unfuturoasud.it/docs/Abstract-Paleo5.pdf and http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx. In September 2005, Evelyn had a joint exhibition in the Atelier Circulaire in Montreal together with the Canadian artist Ana Francine B\u00e9land.See: Centres d'artistes autog\u00e9r\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec 2005 / Programmation d'automne http://www.rcaaq.org/fichiers/membres/pdf/prog_aut_2005.pdf . In 2005-2006, Angelo Evelyn and two other artists, Li Portenl\u00e4nger and Luc Piron, as well as a poet based in Aachen, cooperated on a joint project to artistically reflect the anti-war essence and physical as well as aesthetic reality of a large ensemble of bigger-than-lifesize sculptures embedded in the Jurassic landscape near Eichst\u00e4tt.See the article \"Vier K\u00fcnstler n\u00e4hern sich dem \"Figurenfeld\"\", in the South German daily Donaukurier, Nov. 4, 2005, also accessible online: http://www.donaukurier.de/lokales/eichstaett/5E-Figuren05-K-Vier-Kuenstler- naehern-sich-dem-Figurenfeld;art575,1236864 (registration and payment required, in order to access the complete article). The ensemble of sculptures, known locally as the Figurenfeld (field of figures) was created by the sculptor A. W\u00fcnsche-Mitterecker, as an early example of land art. It represented a post-battle scene of slaughter and horrid death. The theme was treated in the form of large lithographic prints by Evelyn.See the article \"Figurenfeld als kosmischer Raum\" (The Field of Figures as Cosmic Space), in the South German daily Donaukurier, Nov. 11, 2005, p. 29, which comments on \"Die Ausstellung \"Erfahren, Erinnern \u2013 das Figurenfeld in Eichst\u00e4tt\" von Angelo Evelyn, Luc Piron and Li Portenl\u00e4nger\", also online http://www.donaukurier.de/lokales/eichstaett/5E-Figuren12-Figurenfeld-als- Kosmischer-Raum;art575,1242465 (access to the complete article requires payment).

On Nov. 24, 2008, the Donaukurier featured both Evelyn and his artist colleague Wolfgang Schmitz, discussing their exhibition. This daily has repeatedly focused on Evelyn, most recently in Feb. 2014, when the Donaukurier interviewed Evelyn.See: Donaukurier, 24 Feb. 2014. An official Eichstaett county (Landkreis Eichstatt) publication refers to him as \"this globally renowned artist\" (\"diesen weltbekannten K\u00fcnstler\").The publication is also available online. See: http://www.landkreis- eichstaett.de/Startseite/Suche.aspx?view=~/kxp/orgdata/default&orgid;=5f19d832-5b62-4826-9b99-e8b0cf73dd51. It was also in 2008 that Evelyn was artist in residence in Val-David, Quebec, Canada, creating lithographic prints at the Atelier de l'\u00cele de Val-David.See also Val-David's Symposium International d'art nature multidiciplinaire and Songes d'\u00e9t\u00e9, \"un \u00e9v\u00e9nement culturel d'arts visuels, de sculpture, musique et danse .\" He also had a solo exhibition in the Atelier de l'\u00cele in that year. And in the following year, 2009, the artist had a solo exhibition in the context of a multi-disciplinary encounter, \"Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione: Vacanze Eco-Educative [...]\" in the Auditorium Giovanni Paolo II, Seminario Arcivescovile de Benevento, Benevento (Italy). In Benevento (near Naples), he presented 22 lithographic works, among them works he had created during his stay as artist in residence in Val David, Canada, a year earlier.See the publication Incontri con la Paleontologia, V Edizione published by the archdiocese in Benevento, Italy in 2009, which is partially available online: http://www.unfuturoasud.it/docs/Abstract-Paleo5.pdf and www.unfuturoasud.it/docs/paleo5-post.doc. He presented 22 lithographic prints on this occasion.See the photo showing two of the exhibition rooms in the auditory of the John Paul II Seminary of the Benevento archdiocese, with some of the lithographic prints by Angelo Evelyn: http://www.unfuturoasud.it/docs/paleo5-post.doc. ====Recent international art expos he took part in==== Among more recent international art exhibitions that Evelyn was invited to take part in, the following may be mentioned: In 2012, Evelyn was invited to participate in the Second European Lithography Days, Munich (Germany).See: http://www.lithotage.de/english_lithotage/exhibitions/index.html .
