    "text": "Spaghetti alla puttanesca (; in Italian) is an Italian pasta dish invented in Naples in the mid-20th century. Its ingredients typically include tomatoes, olive oil, olives, capers, and garlic, in addition to pasta. ==Origin== Various recipes in Italian cookbooks dating back to the 19th century describe pasta sauces very similar to a modern puttanesca sauce under different names. Among the earliest dates from 1844, when Ippolito Cavalcanti, in his Cucina teorico-pratica, included a recipe from popular Neapolitan cuisine, calling it Vermicelli all'oglio con olive capperi ed alici salse. After some sporadic appearances in other Neapolitan cookbooks, in 1931 the Touring Club Italiano's Guida gastronomica d'Italia lists it among the gastronomic specialties of Campania, calling it \"Maccheroni alla marinara\", although the proposed recipe is close to that of a modern puttanesca sauce. In Naples, this type of pasta sauce commonly goes under the name aulive e chiapparielle (olives and capers). The dish under its current name first appears in gastronomic literature in the 1960s. The earliest known mention of pasta alla puttanesca is in Raffaele La Capria\u2019s Ferito a Morte (Mortal Wound), a 1961 Italian novel which mentions \"spaghetti alla puttanesca come li fanno a Siracusa (spaghetti alla puttanesca as they make it in Syracuse)\".The dictionary entry is cited in Jeremy Parzen, \u2018The origins of Sugo alla puttanesca?\u2019, Do Bianchi, 13 January 2008, an article which supplied a number of the sources used here. The sauce became popular in the 1960s, according to the Professional Union of Italian Pasta Makers.\u2018Sughi d\u2019Italia: 1000 anni di pasta, 1000 anni di condimenti\u2019 , Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani Nonetheless, the 1971 edition of the Cucchiaio d\u2019argento (The Silver Spoon), one of Italy's most prominent cookbooks, has no recipe with the name puttanesca, but two recipes that are similar: The Neapolitan spaghetti alla partenopea, is made with anchovies and generous quantities of oregano; while spaghetti alla siciliana is distinguished by the addition of green peppers. Still again there is a Sicilian style popular around Palermo that includes olives, anchovies and raisins.Il nuovissimo cucchiaio d'argento, ed. by Antonia Monti Tedeschi, 6th edn (Editoriale Domus, 1971), pp. 220\u2013221 In a 2005 article from Il Golfo\u2014a daily newspaper serving the Italian islands of Ischia and Procida\u2014Annarita Cuomo asserted that sugo alla puttanesca was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of Rancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.Annarita Cuomo (17 February 2005). \u2018Il sugo \u201calla puttanesca\u201d nacque per caso ad Ischia, dall'estro culinario di Sandro Petti\u2019. Il Golfo. Archived from the original on 13 August 2014 According to Cuomo, Petti's moment of inspiration came when\u2014near closing one evening\u2014Petti found a group of customers sitting at one of his tables. He was low on ingredients and told them he did not have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry, saying \"Facci una puttanata qualsiasi,\" meaning \"throw together whatever.\" Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some capers\u2014the basic ingredients for the sugo, \"So I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,\" Petti told Cuomo. Later, Petti included this dish on his menu as spaghetti alla puttanesca. However, due to \"puttana\" meaning \"whore\" or \"prostitute,\" it has generated the theory that the dish was invented in one of many bordellos in Quartieri Spagnoli. ==Basic recipe== The sauce alone is called sugo alla puttanesca in Italian. Recipes may differ according to preferences; for instance, the Neapolitan version is prepared without anchovies, unlike the version popular in Lazio. Spices are sometimes added. In most cases, however, the sugo is a little salty (from the capers, olives, and anchovies) and quite fragrant (from the garlic). Traditionally, the sauce is served with spaghetti, although it is also paired with penne, bucatini, linguine, and vermicelli. Garlic and anchovies (omitted in the Neapolitan version) are saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. Chopped chili peppers, olives, capers, diced tomatoes, and oregano are added along with salt and black pepper to taste. The cook then reduces this mixture by simmering and pours it over spaghetti cooked al dente. The final touch is a topping of parsley.Recipe on the site for the Accademia Italiana della Cucina ==In popular culture== The dish is featured in The Bad Beginning from the novel series Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events as the dish the Baudelaire children prepare at Count Olaf's house. The dish also features prominently in the movie based on the novels, as well as the Netflix original series. Count Olaf is very upset that they had not prepared roast beef for him instead. == See also == * Spaghetti dishes * Pasta dishes ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Italian cuisine Category:Neapolitan cuisine Category:Spaghetti dishes Category:Anchovy dishes Category:Olive dishes ",
