    "text": "Common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in the breeding season on Texel, the Netherlands. The common eider (pronounced ) (Somateria mollissima), also called St. Cuthbert's duck or Cuddy's duck, is a large ( in body length) sea- duck that is distributed over the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions, but winters somewhat farther south in temperate zones, when it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to . The eider's nest is built close to the sea and is lined with eiderdown, plucked from the female's breast. This soft and warm lining has long been harvested for filling pillows and quilts, but in more recent years has been largely replaced by down from domestic farm-geese and synthetic alternatives. Although eiderdown pillows or quilts are now a rarity, eiderdown harvesting continues and is sustainable, as it can be done after the ducklings leave the nest with no harm to the birds. The scientific name of the duck is derived from Ancient Greek s\u014dma \"body\" and erion \"wool\", and Latin mollissimus \"very soft\", all referring to its down feathers. ==Description== A common eider skull Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden The common eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe, and is exceeded in North America only by smatterings of the Muscovy duck, which only reaches North America in a wild state in southernmost Texas and south Florida. It measures in length, weighs and spans across the wings. The average weight of 22 males in the North Atlantic was while 32 females weighed an average of . It is characterized by its bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks, except other eider species, on the basis of size and head shape. The drake's display call is a strange almost human-like \"ah-ooo,\" while the hen utters hoarse quacks. The species is often readily approachable. Drakes of the European, eastern North American and Asia/western North American races can be distinguished by minor differences in plumage and bill colour. Some authorities place the subspecies v-nigra as a separate species. This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion. It is abundant, with populations of about 1.5\u20132 million birds in both North America and Europe, and also large but unknown numbers in eastern Siberia (HBW). A particularly famous colony of eiders lives on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, England. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by Saint Cuthbert in the year 676. About 1,000 pairs still nest there every year. Because St. Cuthbert is the patron saint of Northumberland, it was natural that the eider should be chosen as the county's emblem bird; the birds are still often called Cuddy's ducks in the area, \"Cuddy\" being the familiar form of \"Cuthbert\". In Canada's Hudson Bay, important eider die-offs were observed in the 1990s by local populations due to quickly changing ice flow patterns. The Canadian Wildlife Service has spent several years gathering up-to-date information on their populations, and preliminary results seem to show a population recovery. The common eider is the object of the 2011 documentary People of a Feather, which studies the historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and eiders, as well as various aspects of their ecology. The common eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. ==Social behaviour== Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders frequently exhibit a high degree of natal philopatry, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of kin-based female social structures. This relatedness has likely played a role in the evolution of co-operative breeding behaviours amongst eiders. Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals and cr\u00e8ching, where female eiders team up and share the work of rearing ducklings. ==Gallery== File:Common Eider from the Crossley ID Guide Britain and Ireland.jpg|Common eider composite File:Somateria mollissima (Common Eider) male, London Wetland Centre - Diliff.jpg|Adult drake File:Somateria mollissima male female.jpg|Adult male left, female right File:Common_eider_750pix.jpg|Adult male in eclipse plumage File:Common eider juv arp 750pix.jpg|Male juvenile in first winter plumage, similar but different from eclipse plumage File:erfugl_1764.jpg|Female File:Female_Common_Eider_(Somateria_mollissima).png|Female File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Eider drake (Somateria mollissima) in flight.jpg|Male in flight File:Eider-duck fur pelerine.jpg|Eider duck skin coat File:Eider nestingboxes.JPG|Traditional man-made eider nesting boxes File:Eider nest.jpg|Eider nest on the tundra in the Canadian Arctic File:EiderCreche.jpg|Small eider creche: three adult females over six ducklings at Biddeford Pool, ME.
