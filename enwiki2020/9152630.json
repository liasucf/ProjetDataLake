    "text": "The Archdiocese of Monrovia (Archidioecesis Monroviensis) is the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Monrovia, Liberia. It follows the Latin Rite. It was elevated to an archdiocese in December 1981. It was initially established as the Prefecture Apostolic of Liberia in 1903, being separated from the Apostolic Vicariate of Sierra Leone (which is now the Archdiocese of Freetown and Bo). Until Saturday, February 12, 2011, the Archdiocese of Monrovia had been headed by Michael Kpakala Francis, who had been Monrovia's Archbishop since its elevation in 1981, but Vatican Information Service (VIS) stated that he resigned that day for reasons of age and was succeeded immediately by his Coadjutor Archbishop, Lewis Jerome Zeigler (under canon law, each bishop must offer to resign when he turns 75, which may or may not be accepted then). According to church statistics, the percentage of Catholics under the Archdiocese has risen to 8.2% of the total population in 2004 out of a total of approximately 1.6 million people. The Diocese of Cape Palmas was created from it in 1981. The Diocese of Gbarnga was created from it in 1986. == Bishops == ===Ordinaries=== ====Prefect Apostolic of Liberia==== * Father Jean Og\u00e9, SMA (3 January 1911 \u2013 16 November 1931) * Father John Collins, SMA (26 February 1932 \u2013 9 April 1934); see below ====Vicar Apostolic of Liberia==== * John Collins, SMA (9 April 1934 \u2013 2 February 1950); see above & below ====Vicars Apostolic of Monrovia==== * John Collins, SMA (2 February 1950 \u2013 20 December 1960); see above * Francis Carroll, SMA (20 December 1960 \u2013 28 October 1976); concurrent with this, became nuncio in 1961 and titular archbishop in 1964 * Michael Kpakala Francis (28 October 1976 \u2013 19 December 1981); see below ====Archbishops of Monrovia==== * Michael Kpakala Francis (19 December 1981 \u2013 12 February 2011); see above * Lewis Jerome Zeigler (12 February 2011 \u2013 present) ===Coadjutor Archbishop=== *Lewis Jerome Zeigler (2009-2011) ===Other priest of this diocese who became bishop=== *Lewis Jerome Zeigler (priest here, 1974-1986), appointed Bishop of Gbarnga in 2002; later returned here as Coadjutor ==See also== *List of Roman Catholic dioceses in Liberia *Stella Maris Polytechnic ==Sources== * Archdiocese of Monrovia on catholichierarchy.org Category:Christian organizations established in 1903 Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Liberia Archdiocese of Monrovia Category:Roman Catholic dioceses and prelatures established in the 20th century ",
