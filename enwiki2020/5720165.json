    "text": "The 1983 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1982\u201383 season. This was the final postseason using the 12-team format, before the NBA expanded the postseason to 16 teams the next season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 0 in the NBA Finals. Moses Malone was named NBA Finals MVP. Malone made a famous prediction about the Sixers' chances prior to the playoffs, saying \"Fo', fo', fo'\" \u2013 predicting the number of games the Sixers would need to win each of the three series they would play on the way to a championship. They nearly accomplished this prediction of a sweep of all three rounds, only losing one game (to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference Finals) en route to the championship. The Sixers set a record for highest winning percentage in the playoffs that was not broken until the Lakers went 15\u20131 in 2001. The Lakers' mark, however, came after the expansion to the current 16-team, four- round playoff format, which was first implemented in the 1984 playoffs, while the Sixers avoided the first round by virtue of their top seeding. It was the third time in four years that the Lakers and 76ers had met in the NBA Finals, with the Lakers winning the previous two series. After missing the playoffs the previous year, the Blazers began a string of 21 straight playoff appearances in 1983 lasting until 2003. They made the playoffs 25 out of 26 years from their title-winning season of 1977\u20132003. The record was just one season shy of the 22-year playoff run set by the Syracuse Nationals/Philadelphia 76ers from 1950\u20131971. The Celtics were swept out of the playoffs for the first time in team history, losing 4\u20130 to the Bucks in the second round. This was the Spurs' last appearance in the Conference Finals until 1995. However, for players such as George Gervin and Artis Gilmore, the 6-game loss to the Lakers was the last chance they got at reaching the NBA Finals, let alone an NBA Championship (Gilmore did return to the conference finals with the Celtics in 1988, but played sparingly). ==Bracket== ==Western Conference== ===First Round=== (1) Los Angeles Lakers and (2) San Antonio Spurs have first-round byes.
