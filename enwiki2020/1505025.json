    "text": "The East India Club is a gentlemen's club founded in 1849 and situated at 16, St James's Square in London. The full title of the club is the East India, Devonshire, Sports and Public Schools' Club due to mergers with other clubs. ==History== Founded in the middle of the 19th century, the club's original members, as set out in the Rule Book of 1851, were: But within the first two decades of the club's foundation, the East India Company started to lose its Indian possessions and was wound up entirely in 1874. As a result, the club could no longer look to the East India Company as its main source of members. Since then, the club has amalgamated with the Sports Club (1938), the Public Schools Club (1972) and the Devonshire (1976), all of which ran into the twin problems of keeping up membership numbers and making ends meet, especially with the escalating costs of maintenance for historic buildings. With the disappearance of the East India Company, the public school influence has become an important one. The club is still primarily referred to as the East India Club or EIC for convenience.

The East India Club is a popular venue for private events and offers conference facilities. The club has reciprocal arrangements with more than 100 clubs throughout the world. Members can use the facilities of overseas reciprocal clubs with a card or letter of introduction issued by the East India Club.Reciprocal Clubs at East India Club web site (accessed 23 August 2008) ==Club house== The club premises are situated at 16 St James's Square, London SW1, on the west side of the square. The first occupant of the house was Thomas Jermyn, 2nd Baron Jermyn (?1670-1676). He passed the house on to Robert Villiers, 3rd Viscount Purbeck, who occupied the house for two years (1676\u201378). After Viscount Purbeck, a Swedish Ambassador occupied the house, followed by two successive Earls of Suffolk and the Earl of Romney. The house was then taken over by Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet, the lover and, later, husband of Mary Howard, Duchess of Norfolk. When Sir John died in 1719, he left the house to his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, second daughter of the 2nd Earl of Berkeley. She was to occupy the house for 50 years. When Lady Elizabeth died, the house went to George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville. It then became the home of Admiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere and then of his son, Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans. In 1785, George Anson bought No. 16. When he died in 1789, the house was passed on to his son, Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson. In 1804, Viscount Anson sold the house to Edmund Boehm, a successful merchant. Mr and Mrs Boehm were very active socially and hosted many dinner parties. On 21 June 1815, the Prince Regent (later George IV) was the principal guest at the dinner party. He heard the news of the victory at Waterloo at the house, where Major Henry Percy, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, presented the Prince Regent with four captured French eagles and Wellington\u2019s victory despatch. When Edmund Boehm was declared bankrupt, Robert Vyner became the owner of No. 16. In 1825, Vyner sold the house to the Marquess of Clanricarde. During Lord Clanricarde's tenancy, he let the house for a time to the Marquess Wellesley. In 1849, the East India Club Committee signed a lease with Lord Clanricarde. The club bought the house from Lord Clanricarde in 1863. ==Sports sections== In addition to the facilities at the St James's Square clubhouse, the club has several sports sections. There are active Chess, Cricket, Rowing, Rugby, Billiards and Shooting sections as well as other sections, such as the Polo section, who do not compete but do organise trips to various events. The club also has a sports blazer, which may be worn by club members. ===Cricket=== The club's cricket team begins the season with nets sessions at Lords and the Oval with a social beverage or two afterwards. These are open to all members. There is a mix of Sunday friendly cricket and T20 evening matches, and they end the season with a tour in another country. ===Rowing=== East India Club Rowing Blade Design The Rowing Section boats out of Auriol Kensington Rowing Club in Hammersmith and competes at events such as Head of the River, Head of the River Fours, Henley Town and Visitors Regatta, Staines Regatta, Molesey Amateur Regatta, Hammersmith Regatta and Oxford Regatta, and has twice competed in the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta, beating Oxford Brookes B in the 2019 regatta before being beaten in the quarter-final by Leander Club.
