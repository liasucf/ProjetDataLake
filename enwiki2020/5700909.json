    "text": "Chicken dopiaza with rice Dopiaza (meaning \"two onions\") is the name of an onion-based dish. It is prepared with many onions, both cooked in the spices and curry and as a garnish. Onions are added at two stages during cooking, hence the name. The dish usually contains a meat, usually beef, chicken, lamb, mutton, or shrimp; however, it can also be prepared in a vegetarian style. ==History== According to the legend the dish was created when a courtier of Mughal emperor Akbar Mullah Do Piaza accidentally added a large quantity of onions to a dish. The dish evolved further in Hyderabad, India, Pakistan, and many other countries around the world and became a staple of Mughal cuisine. ==Ingredients== As many other Hyderabadi dishes, the addition of a sour agent is a key part of dopiaza. Most often, raw mangoes are used; however, lemon juice or cranberries can be used as well. Basic ingredients for dopiaza are chicken or other meats, onions, ginger and garlic paste, whole hot spices (black cardamoms, cloves and peppercorns), salt and chili powder. Iranian Dopiaza may be prepared using potatoes, onion, turmeric powder, tomato paste, dried fenugreek leaves, and spices. ==See also== * Kairi ka Do Pyaza * List of onion dishes * Mullah Do Piaza ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:Indian curries Category:Hyderabadi cuisine Category:Telangana cuisine Category:Pakistani curries Category:Muhajir cuisine Category:Iranian cuisine Category:Onion-based foods ",
