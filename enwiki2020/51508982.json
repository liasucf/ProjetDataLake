It started on May 22, 2015, in Taipei, Taiwan at Taipei Arena and continued throughout Asia and North America before concluding on July 16, 2016, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at Stadium Merdeka. ==Background== To promote her eleventh studio album, Myself, Tsai embarked on Myself World Tour, which visited Taiwan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and the United Kingdom, but did not go to the United States. The tour was a commercial success with a total gross was NT$150 million from 35 sold-out shows. After the Myself Tour, Tsai worked on her thirteen studio album, Play, throughout 2014. Tsai formally announced in early 2015 a new concert tour, titled Play World Tour, scheduled to begin on May 22, 2015, from Taipei and continue throughout Asia. Play World Tour is led by Live Nation Entertainment, and it is Tsai's first collaboration with Live Nation. Tsai held a dancer audition in Los Angeles, and she picked twelve dancers from the United States. Tour directors Travis Payne and Stacy Walker invited fourteen choreographers either from the Americas or Europe to choreograph new dance moves. The first two-week rehearsals began in March 2015 in Los Angeles, and the team rehearsed on a real stage in Taipei. ==Concert synopsis== The show began with a video featuring Tsai in a red veiling standing in front of a full moon with a steam train moving in a tunnel. Tsai was lifted to the stage with wearing a helmet as the hair of Medusa to sing \"Medusa\". The first video interlude featured a video of Tsai playing a traditional Chinese style swordswoman. The next segment started with \"I'm Not Yours\", where Tsai dressed a specially designed red cheongsam and sang the song alongside a large fake skull. The second video interlude featured a video of Tsai playing an actress in opera experiencing a sadness, and the third section began with an acoustic version of \"The Great Artist\" with Tsai dressed a 1920s-inspired gown. The segment was closed after her rendition of \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache\", an aria in the second act of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. The show ended with \"Play\", and audience exited during a background music was playing, which is Tsai's cover of Taiwanese singer Fei Yu-ching song \"Good Night Song\". ==Set list== This setlist was obtained from the concert of May 22, 2015 held at Taipei Arena in Taipei.
