    "text": "Jo\u00e3o Alexandre Duarte Ferreira Fernandes (born 31 December 1979), known as Neca, is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a midfielder. He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 225 matches and 29 goals over the course of 12 seasons, representing in the competition Belenenses, Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, Mar\u00edtimo and Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. He also played professionally in Turkey. ==Club career== Born in Lisbon, Neca started playing professionally for local C.F. Os Belenenses, being a starter from an early age. In the 2005\u201306 season he moved to fellow Primeira Liga club Vit\u00f3ria S.C. and, although he was an important first-team member, the Guimar\u00e3es-based side were relegated. In the summer of 2006, Neca signed for C.S. Mar\u00edtimo on a Bosman transfer. After limited playing time, he was loaned out to Konyaspor in January 2007. He was definitely released by the Madeirans in December but stayed in Turkey, switching to Ankaraspor. In late December 2009, Neca agreed on a return to his country, signing with struggling Vit\u00f3ria F.C. until the end of the campaign and contributing with 11 games and two goals as the Sadinos eventually escaped relegation. In the summer of 2012, at nearly 33, he returned to Konyaspor, with the club now in the second division. ==International career== Neca represented Portugal at both the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. In 2002, courtesy of his consistent performances at Belenenses, he earned two full caps. ==References== ==External links== * * *National team data * * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:C.F.
