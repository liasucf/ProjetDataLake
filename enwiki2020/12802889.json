Fifty-one buildings in total were razed to make space for the development. The buildings were designed to house a fraternity on each end of the building, with independents living in the rooms in between. At the time the quad was built, many (though not all) of the University's fraternities were in financial trouble and membership numbers struggled due to the limited number of civilian students on campus (much of the University's housing at the time was used for students in the Armed Forces training program). In return for University housing in Wriston Quadrangle, the fraternities were compelled to deed their privately owned houses (many in disrepair) to the University. The quad still houses the majority of the University's fraternities, sororities, and program houses. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" ! Building ! class=\"unsortable\" | Image !
