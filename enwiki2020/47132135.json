In 2010, Maria Khaltunen (also \"Khaltunin\" or \"Haltunen\"), who directs the museum's cat programme, stated that there were 60 cats on the museum grounds, even though the staff has a joke that officially the museum is only supposed to have 50 cats.Marquardt, Alexander. \"St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum Home to Masters...and Cats\" (Archive).

There are kitchens for preparing their food (\"they all have different preferences\"), and even a small hospital. As of 2013, donations (a \u20ac400-per-month payment from the charity Pro Animale, and the sponsorship of Royal Canin) fund the presence of the cats. == History == The cats were present in the museum, originally a palace, since the 18th century; in 1745, Elizabeth of Russia ordered cats to be placed in the palace in order to control the mice.McGrane, Sally. \"Russia\u2019s Museum Cats\" (Archive). The New Yorker. September 25, 2012. Retrieved on July 2, 2015. James Rodgers of the BBC stated that the belief is that the cats originated from Kazan, a city known for having cats good at catching mice. The cats remained in St. Petersburg except during World War II, when the existing cat population was killed. A new group of cats replaced the previous cats since the rat population had increased. In the late 1990s, Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions. As of 2007, the museum began adopting cats needing homes. In 2011, the museum began a \"Catfest\", a celebration of its cat population. \"Catfest\" has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children. Beginning in 2015, because of the number of visiting tourists, a website has been set up by the museum for people who may be interested in adopting a cat. \"It is an honor to adopt a Hermitage cat\", one potential cat owner was told. == See also == Other cats kept to deter mice in public buildings include: * Canadian Parliamentary Cats * Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, United Kingdom * Tibs the Great kept by the Royal Mail in the UK. ==References== ==Further reading== * The Hermitage Museum and Maria Haltunen, The Hermitage Cats: Treasures from the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.
