    "text": "thumb Shieldhill Castle is a category B listed building located near Biggar in South Lanarkshire. The building dates back to 1199 and is currently being run as Shieldhill Castle Hotel. ==Reported hauntings== A grey lady ghost has been sighted by hotel guests in the corridors of the building. One belief is she was a former occupant of the house who fell for someone of a lower social class. The story goes that she killed herself as a result of her father forbidding their relationship. Additionally a male ghost clothed in a what appears to be butler's uniform has been reported in the hotel's former staff quarters. ==Ownership== The Chancellor family resided in the castle for over 750 years. After being sold by the family it was turned into a hotel in 1959. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Castles in South Lanarkshire Category:Category B listed buildings in South Lanarkshire Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Scotland Category:Hotels in Scotland ",
