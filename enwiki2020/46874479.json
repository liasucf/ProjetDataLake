    "text": "Hypnotic Donuts is a small chain of doughnut shops, with its first store in Dallas, Texas and another in Denton, Texas. Amy and James St. Peter founded it in 2010. In addition to donuts, they also make chicken biscuits. It was the first doughnut shop to purvey vegan doughnuts in Dallas, Texas. ==History== James and Amy determined that Hypnotic Donuts would be different in every way, especially in how it would be conceived and launched. James approached a donut shop that he frequented in Plano, TX, asked the owner\u2019s son if his father would be interested in teaching James how to produce donuts, and the young man responded in the affirmative provided the training would begin at midnight. The training took about three weeks because of the language barrier, but because James had filmed all the lessons, he was able to continue his education by just watching the videos in his home. Originally, the donuts were sold exclusively via social media with a very limited number of orders being taken. These orders were delivered by means of a black Ford Expedition in randomly selected parking lots with cash as the only payment method. As its customer base increased, Hypnotic Donuts expanded by renting a pizza restaurant, selling donuts out of it from 7am-10:30am on weekends. At this time, donut sales were generated only by word of mouth. Patrons would remark, \u201cI found this place because I was wondering why there was a line outside the door of a pizza shop at 7am.\u201d Hypnotic Donuts was first housed at 9007 Garland Road, they opened a second location in Denton at 235 W. Hickory St between the downtown square and UNT campus. Hypnotic is now is the process of opening Hypnotic Emporium, a vintage candy and ice cream shop that will be located next door to Hypnotic Donuts in Dallas, on Garland Road. ==Donuts & chicken biscuits== All donuts are trans-fat free, handmade, hand cut and made fresh throughout the day. All icings, frostings and even the mustard for the biscuits are made in-house. The chicken biscuits were added to the menu six months after the opening of the Dallas store. All of the chicken is fresh, marinated 24 hours and cooked to order. Hypnotic Donuts has received numerous awards for their biscuits and because of this now uses the name Hypnotic Donuts and Biscuits. ==Community== Hypnotic Donuts has donated over $10,000 to various organizations throughout the Dallas and Denton, TX communities. The City of Dallas and Mayor Rawlings gave Mayoral Recognition of June 6, National Donut Day, as official Hypnotic Donut Day in Dallas. By 2015 Hypnotic Donuts has grown their charitable giving so substantially that they have been able to create a new umbrella called Team Hypnotic. Hypnotic Donuts Dallas and Denton as well as Hypnotic Emporium will be under this umbrella. Being a part of Team Hypnotic they are able to work with local charities, teams and organizations to help support their efforts. In one of their recent efforts Team Hypnotic donated over $3,000 to Carry The Load. Aside from donating to many notable charities, Team Hypnotic also puts on two large annual events- The Hypnotic Donut Dash and The Hypnotic Polar Plunge. The Hypnotic Donut Dash occurs at The State Fair of Texas; it is a 5k run that has donut holes along the course and free donuts after the race. The Hypnotic Polar Plunge is the first Sunday in January and is used as a way to clean your soul for the New Year. Participants of the Polar Plunge gather at the FOE, they jump into and swim the length of the pool. Both events have proceeds donated to a charity. ==See also== * List of doughnut shops ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Doughnut shops Category:Restaurants in Dallas Category:2010 establishments in Texas ",
