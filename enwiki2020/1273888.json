It organises the football leagues \u2013 Allsvenskan for men and Damallsvenskan for women \u2013 and the men's and women's national teams. It is based in Solna and is a founding member of both FIFA and UEFA. SvFF is supported by 24 district organisations. == Background == Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet (SvFF) (English:Swedish Football Association) was founded in Stockholm on 18 December 1904 and is the sports federation responsible for the promotion and administration of organised football in Sweden and also represents the country outside Sweden. SvFF is affiliated to the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Karl- Erik Nilsson has been the President since 2012. In 2009 there were 3,359 clubs affiliated to the Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet with a total of more than a million members, of whom about 500,000 were active players. Together, they accounted for almost one third of the total Swedish sports movement activities. SvFF administers the Swedish men's respectively women's national football teams, other football teams and leagues including the Allsvenskan and Superettan. The motto of Swedish football \u2013 \"one club in every village, football for all\" \u2013 is reflected in the democratic constitution of Swedish football. All football competition in the nation is arranged by the SvFF and its 24 district organisations. The clubs are voting members at the annual meetings of the district organisations. The district organisations and the elite clubs are entitled to vote at the F.A.'s general meeting. SvFF was the sole owner of Sweden's national stadium, the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Solna, from 1999 until it was replaced in 2012 by Friends Arena, located about 1 kilometer away and also in Solna. SvFF is the lead partner in the consortium that owns the current stadium, and maintains its offices there (as it did at the prior stadium). The Swedish Football Association Football Gala is held annually in November since 2005. It includes the award for the best male player (Guldbollen) and female players (Diamantbollen). SvFF had a turnover 2008 of 554 MSEK. == Early history == The first Swedish national football championship was played in 1896 but it was 7 years later in 1903 that the Riksidrottsf\u00f6rbundet was formed which was to be the precursor to the Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet. The new organisation had a football and hockey section (hockey being the term for bandy at that time and not ice hockey or field hockey). In 1904 Sweden was one of 7 nations that founded FIFA. It also introduced ice hockey to Sweden in 1920, before the 1922 establishment of the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. Before the 1925 establishment of the Swedish Bandy Association, the Swedish Football Association also administered organized bandy in Sweden. In 1906 the name Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet (Swedish Football Association) was officially accepted and the following year SvFF was officially voted into FIFA. On 12 July 1908, Sweden's first international match was played in which Norway were defeated 11\u20133 in Gothenburg. However the Olympics were a disappointment for Sweden, losing 1\u201312 to England and 0\u20132 to the Netherlands. == Competitions == {| class=\"infobox football\" style=\"width: 16em; text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"font-size: 14px; background: #BFD7FF;\" | Swedish Football League Structure |- | style=\"font-size: 12px;\" | Allsvenskan (Tier 1) Superettan (Tier 2) Division 1 (Tier 3) Division 2 (Tier 4) Division 3 (Tier 5) Division 4 (Tier 6) Division 5 (Tier 7) Division 6 (Tier 8) Division 7 (Tier 9) Division 8 (Tier 10) |- |} {| class=\"infobox football\" style=\"width: 16em; text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"font-size: 14px; background: #BFD7FF;\" | Swedish Football Women's League Structure |- | style=\"font-size: 12px;\" | Damallsvenskan (Tier 1) Elitettan (Tier 2) Women's Division 1 (Tier 3) Women's Division 2 (Tier 4) Women's Division 3 (Tier 5) Women's Division 4 (Tier 6) Women's Division 5 (Tier 7) Women's Division 6 (Tier 8) |- |} Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet is responsible for organising the following competitions: ===Men's football=== *Allsvenskan (Tier 1) *Superettan (Tier 2) *Division 1 (Tier 3) \u2013 two sections *Division 2 (Tier 4) \u2013 six sections *Division 3 (Tier 5) \u2013 twelve sections * Folksam utvecklingsserie \u2013 two sections ===Women's football=== *Damallsvenskan (Tier 1) *Elitettan (Tier 2) *Division 1 Norrettan (Tier 3) *Division 1 S\u00f6derettan (Tier 3) *Division 2 (Tier 4) \u2013 nine sections ===Junior=== *Juniorallsvenskan *Pojkallsvenskan ===Cups=== *Svenska Cupen \u2013 Men *Svenska Cupen \u2013 Women *CANAL+-cupen \u2013 Junior Boys *Cup Kommunal \u2013 Junior Girls ==Honours== ===Men's=== ;FIFA World Cup *Runners-up (1958) *Third place (1950, 1994) ;Olympic Games *Winners (1948) *Third place (1924, 1952) ;FIFA U-17 World Cup * Third place (2013) ;UEFA European Under-21 Championship * Winners (2015) * Runners-up (1992) ===Women's=== ;FIFA Women's World Cup * Runners-up (2003) * Third place (1991, 2011, 2019) ;Olympic Games * Runners-up (2016) ;UEFA Women's Championship * Winners (1984) * Runners-up (1987, 1995, 2001) ;UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship * Winners (1999, 2012, 2015) * Runners-up (2009) ;UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship * Runners-up (2013) == District Football Associations == Swedish football is built on a single pyramid league system.
