    "text": "The Jur\u00e9ia Massif () is an isolated group of mountains on the coast of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The mountains hold a well-preserved remnant of Atlantic Forest, and are contained in the fully protected Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station. ==Location== The name \"Jur\u00e9ia\" means prominent point in the Tupi-Guaran\u00ed language. The Serra da Jur\u00e9ia is a Precambrian horst on the coast of the municipality of Iguape in the south of S\u00e3o Paulo state. The massif covers and rises to . The eastern side falls steeply to the ocean. It is an inselberg connected to the mainland by a sandy alluvial plain that was formed 5100 years ago during the post-glacial Canan\u00e9ia Transgression, when the sea was about higher than at present. The Paranapu massif, part of the Serra dos Itatins, rises from the plain to the north. ==Hydrology== The streams formed in the Serra da Jur\u00e9ia are clear, with a pH of 5-6.5, and are low in nutrients. A few originate in springs in the campo, but most are rain-fed and intermittent. Quiet streams may become torrential during times of heavy rainfall. The Una do Prelado River, a blackwater river, meanders in a northeast direction through the plain between the Serra da Jur\u00e9ia and the Serra dos Itatins. The Serra da Jur\u00e9ia is divided by the valley of the Rio Verde, which flows south to the ocean. ==Environment== Average annual temperatures range from . Average annual rainfall is . The climate is tropical humid with no dry season. At least of rain falls in the driest month. The Serra da Jur\u00e9ia and its surroundings hold one of the best preserved remnants of Atlantic Forest on the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo. Above the mountains are covered by campo vegetation - fields of grass, herbs and shrubs. The slopes and base of the mountain are clothed in evergreen tropical forest. There is a wide variety of species of flora, some rare. ==Conservation== The Department of the Environment planned to develop a \"green\" housing project on the banks of the Rio Verde. The project was cancelled in the 1980s when the Empresa Nuclebr\u00e1s Brasileira decided to build the Iguape 4 and Iguape 5 power plants in a area that included the entire Serra da Jur\u00e9ia. By law, the area surrounding the nuclear power plant would have to be made an ecological station. The power plant project was abandoned but the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station was created on 20 January 1986, covering the Jur\u00e9ia Massif and the entire watershed of the Una do Prelado River. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * Category:Landforms of S\u00e3o Paulo (state) ",
