    "text": "The Jasper Ocean Terminal (JOT) is a planned deepwater container port that will be built in South Carolina on the Savannah River, about downstream from Savannah, Georgia. JOT is planned to open between 2035 and 2037, when additional capacity is needed by both the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) and the South Carolina Ports Authority (SCPA), initially with two berths for container ships. The project has been in various stages of planning since 2007 and in 2008 the GPA and SCPA signed an early agreement to jointly build and operate the facility. However, political tensions regarding plans to dredge the river slowed progress, and little money was invested--by 2016 only about $10 million had spent on planning and permits. In November 2015, the ports authorities signed an updated agreement to develop the terminal, and in late 2016 a new round of design work began, with an estimated $100 million cost. In January 2017, the Army Corps of Engineers began the environmental impact statement for the dockside portion of Jasper Terminal. The total cost of building the port is estimated at $4.5 billion. At full build-out, JOT will cover 1,500 acres, with ten berths. It will be dredged to a depth, able to accommodate ships carrying as many as 20,000 TEU containers, with an annual capacity of seven million TEUs. Access to the facility will be via a new four lane highway connecting to US Route 17, and rail connections to both CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway lines. ==References== Category:Container terminals Category:Transportation in Jasper County, South Carolina Category:Ports and harbors of South Carolina ",
