His name was added by the Serbian Orthodox Church to the Calendar of Saints. ==Biography== Born in Bosnia in 1794, Lepoje was his Christian name at baptism. When Lepoje was still young, his father died. His mother took him to the Mo\u0161tanica Monastery, near Banja Luka, where Lepoje's uncle was the abbot. There he was educated and later became a monk, taking the name of Avakum. At eighteen, he was an ordained deacon. In 1809, the monks of the Mo\u0161atanica Monastery who took part in an unsuccessful revolt against the Turks had to flee to another monastery in Trnava, a village near \u010ca\u010dak, where the Hegumen was Pajsije. After the failed Kara\u0111or\u0111e\u2019s revolt in 1813, the Turks began a reign of terror against the Serbs. The people decided to attempt yet another revolt, this time under Had\u017ei-Prodan Gligorijevi\u0107, and the monks of the Trnava village became actively involved, among them were deacon Avakum, hegumen Pajsije, hieromonk Genadije, and priest Radovan Vujovi\u0107. The rebellion took place on the Feast of the Cross (September 14), but it was crushed by the Turks. Many people were captured, and some were executed on the spot as a warning to others while the rest were sent to Belgrade to face charges. Among the prisoners were Avakum and Pajsije. The Turks offered to free anyone who would convert to Islam. Some of the prisoners agreed to this, but the majority refused to deny Christ, and so they were put to death, including Avakum and Pajsije. Saint Avakum the deacon is commemorated on December 17 along with Saint Pajsije. == References == Category:1794 births Category:1814 deaths Category:People from Dubica, Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbian Orthodox clergy Category:Serbian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church Category:Persecution of Serbs Category:Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians Category:Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire Category:Christian saints killed by Muslims Category:19th-century Eastern Orthodox martyrs Category:19th-century Christian saints Category:Hieromartyrs ",
