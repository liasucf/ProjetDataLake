    "text": "The Church of St Mary the Virgin (), commonly known as the University Church () is a Catholic Church in the Papn\u00f6velde Street, Belv\u00e1ros-Lip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros District (Inner City District) in Budapest, Hungary. From 1786 the church belongs to the former Theological Faculty of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, and to the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University independent of it; before it was the central church of the Pauline Order. The Central Priestly Educational Institute operates in a block adjacent to the church, so that the liturgical services of the church are performed by the priestly students and the chiefs of the institute. The church has two towers and its towers are 56 meters high. == History == The Pauline Order is the only Hungarian-founded church by 13th- century Hungarian monks. The Pauline order of the Hungarian hermits was organized by Eusebius of Esztergom. In 1329 received confirmation from the Pope. In 1686, after the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Empire, the Pauline moved to Pest when the former mosque was bought with a few neighboring houses. Their history and spirituality inspired the church's artwork. The monastery was built between 1715 and 1742. In place of the demolished mosque, the foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1725. Its architects were Andr\u00e1s Mayerhoffer, one of the most talented figures of Hungarian church and secular Baroque architecture, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Drenker and M\u00e1rton Siegl. The church was consecrated in September 1742. The main portal and the benches were completed in 1744, the altarpiece in 1746, the carving, choir grid and stallum in 1748. The towers were completed in 1768. The church was completed in 1771. The church became the property of the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University after the disintegration of the Pauline Order in 1786. Since 1803, it was the joint church of the university and the Central Priestly Educational Institute, established in the monastery of Paul. Its profession is to mentor young university students and (mainly after 1900) the intellectual class of the capital. == Architecture == The cloister The main facade of the church is divided into three parts. At the top of the triangular pediment is the Pauline coat of arms between the towers and the triangle on the left is Paul of Thebes and to the right is Anthony the Great. A richly carved gate leads into the harmonious interior of a single-nave chapel with rows of chapels on both sides. The walls are covered with marble. The mature Baroque frescoes in the vaults are the works of the then world-famous Johann Bergl. The busy altar of the high altar of Mary is the work of Antal Conti Lip\u00f3t and his frescoes depicts the Ascension of Mary. On the side of the sacristy, between the three columns, stands St. Anthony the Hermit, opposite him, Saint Paul the Hermit in the mantle of a characteristic palm made by J\u00f3zsef Hebenstreiter. The figural decorations of the master pulpit are probably from Antal Conti Lip\u00f3t. The rich decorations of the oak benches and the table inserts depicting the various scenes deserve special attention. == Gallery == Budape\u0161\u0165 1157.jpg|Facade from Papn\u00f6velde Street EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas2.jpg|Towers EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas3.jpg|Detail of the main portal EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas5.jpg|Interior EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas4a.jpg|Sanctuary EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas6a.jpg|Pipe organ EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas7.jpg|Ceiling wall painting EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas8.jpg|Ceiling wall painting EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas12.jpg|Carved decoration in the sanctuary EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas10.jpg|Side altar, carved ornament File:20130612 Budapest 146.jpg|Altar EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas13.jpg|Library File:20130612 Budapest 149.jpg|Baroque pulpit EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas13a.jpg|Detail of the relief of John Bosco EgyetemiTemplomFotoThalerTamas22.jpg|Ornate door refectory EgyetemiTFotoThalerTamas51.jpg|Carved door of the main entrance of the church ==References== ==External links== Category:Belv\u00e1ros-Lip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros Category:Roman Catholic churches in Budapest Category:Baroque architecture in Hungary Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1771 ",
