    "text": "Ebenezer Obey (born 3 April 1942 as Ebenezer Remilekun Aremu Olasupo Obey- Fabiyi, MFR in Idogo, Nigeria), nicknamed the \"Chief Commander\", is a Nigerian j\u00f9j\u00fa musician.Waterman, p. 120 ==Early life== Obey is of an Egba-Yoruba ethnic background. He is of the Owu subgroup of the Egba. ==Career== He began his professional career in the mid-1950s after moving to Lagos. After tutelage under Fatai Rolling-Dollar's band, he formed a band called The International Brothers in 1964, playing highlife-j\u00f9j\u00fa fusion. The band later metamorphosed into Inter-Reformers in the early-1970s, with a long list of Juju album hits on the West African Decca musical label. Obey began experimenting with Yoruba percussion style and expanding on the band by adding more drum kits, guitars and talking drums. Obey's musical strengths lie in weaving intricate Yoruba axioms into dance-floor compositions. As is characteristic of Nigerian Yoruba social-circle music, the Inter-Reformers band excel in praise-singing for rich Nigerian socialites and business tycoons. Obey, however, is also renowned for Christian spiritual themes in his music and has since the early-1990s retired into Nigerian gospel music ministry. It will be worthy of note to also say that Chief Commander just as he is fondly called by his fans, has played alongside popular gospel music veteran, Pastor Kunle Ajayi during his 30 years on stage concert in Lagos. ==Personal life== Obey married Juliana Olaide Olufade in 1963. His wife, known as Lady Evangelist Juliana Obey-Fabiyi, died at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on 23 August 2011, aged 67. They have several children and grand children. ==Partial discography== *1964 Ewa Wo Ohun Ojuri *1965 Aiye Gba Jeje b/w Ifelodun*Gari Ti Won b/w Orin Adura *1966 Awolowo Babawa Tide b/w Oluwa Niagbara Emi Mi*Palongo b/w Teti Ko Gboro Kan*Oro Miko Lenso b/w Orin Ajinde*Late Justice Olumide Omololu b/w Iyawo Ti Mo Ko Fe *1967 Olomi Gbo Temi b/w Maria Odeku*To Keep Nigeria One b/w Awa Sope Odun Titun*Edumare Lon Pese b/w Omo Olomo*Ope Fun Oluwa b/w Paulina *1968 Ore Mi E Si Pelepele b/w Ajo Ni Mo wa*Ijebu L'ade b/w Lati Owolabi*Col.
