Each constituency returns one member to the Legislative Council. Elections must be held at least every four years, though can be called at an earlier date, as happened in 1991. Currently the Turks and Caicos Islands have a two- party system, with the Progressive National Party and People's Democratic Movement vying for power; no other party put up candidates in the 2007 elections. ==Latest elections== ==See also== *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==References== Category:Politics of the Turks and Caicos Islands ",
