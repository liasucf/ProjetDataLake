The Al Thawawda are a sub-clan of the Bani Khalid tribe. In Bahrain, the family is based in Al Hidd and Muharraq. Many family members were involved in the lucrative pearl hunting industry. The Al Thawawda are among those clans that moved to Bahrain from Zubara following the 1783 Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain. Among the famous members of the family are leftist political activist Ahmad Al-Thawadi, and the founder of the Housing Bank, Isa Bin Sultan Al Thawadi, and CEO of the Qatar 2022 World Cup Bid Hassan Bin Abdulla Al Thawadi. ==External links== *Al Thawawda family discussion forum *\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0648\u0627\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f, Al Waqt, 16 October 2009 *\u062a\u0635\u062d\u064a\u062d\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u064a\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a, Al Waqt, 20 November 2009 Category:Tribes of Arabia Category:Tribes of Saudi Arabia Category:Bedouin groups Category:Bahraini families ",
