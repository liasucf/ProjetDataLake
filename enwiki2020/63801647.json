    "text": "Magnus's green salt is an example of a linear chain compound. Linear chain compounds are materials composed of one-dimensional arrays of metal-metal bonded molecules or ions. Such materials exhibit anisotropic electrical conductivity. ==Examples== Most examples are composed of square planar complexes. Thus, upon crystallization, molecules of Rh(acac)(CO)2 stack with Rh---Rh distances of about 326 pm. Classic examples include Krogmann's salt and Magnus's green salt. Other examples include the partially oxidized derivatives of [Pt(oxalate)2]2-. The otherwise ordinary complex IrBr(CO)3 gives an electrically conductive derivative upon oxidation. Such semiconducting materials are eniched in bromine, i.e. IrBr1+x(CO)3-x, where x ~0.05. In contrast to linear chain compounds, extended metal atom chains (EMACs) are molecules or ions that consist of a finite, often short, linear strings of metal atoms, surrounded by organic ligands.F.

Rh(acac)(CO)2 showing the \"stacking\" of the individual planar units through interactions. One group of platinum chains is based on alternating cations and anions of [Pt(CNR)4]2+ (R = iPr, c-C12H23, p-(C2H5)C6H4) and [Pt(CN)4]2\u2212. These may be able to be used as vapochromic sensor materials, or materials which change color when exposed to different vapors. Linear chains of Pd-Pd bonds protected by a \u201c\u03c0-electron sheath are known. Not only do these olefin-stabilized metal chains constitute a significant contribution to the field of organometallic chemistry, both the complex's metal atom structures and the olefin ligands themselves can conduct a current. ==Methodology== Some linear chain compounds are produced or fabricated by electrocrystallization. The technique is used to obtain single crystals of low-dimensional electrical conductors. ==References== Category:Nanotechnology Category:Conductive polymers Category:Molecular electronics Category:Semiconductor material types ",
