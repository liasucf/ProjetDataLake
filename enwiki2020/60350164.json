    "text": "Ulrich of Attems (Ulrich von Attems; 1082 in Attimis, Udine \u2013 1170) was an Italian nobleman from the family of Attems. He also served as the imperial vicar of Tuscany and Spoleto between 1139 and 1152. Ulrich was the son Conrad of Attems (1052\u20131106), who was a Minister of King Conrad III, who regarded himself as the heir of Henry V. Therefore, Ulrich tried in 1128\u20131130 in opposition to the popes to seize the vast Italian properties of Matilda of Tuscany. In 1137, Henry X, Duke of Bavaria (Henry the Proud) of the Welf family was named the Margrave of Tuscany by Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor. Shortly before the death of Henry in 1139, Ulrich was appointed by Conrad (who succeeded Lothair) as vicar there.von Freising, Otto, Chronica, lib. VII, chapter 23 This led to further conflicts between Konrad and the Welf family.Gebhardt, Bruno, Handbuch der deutschen Geschichte: Zw\u00f6lftes Jahrhundert, 1125-1198, p. 67 Ulrich as vicar ruled over Tuscany and Spoleto until 1152. During his time in Tuscany, the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily attacked and conquered northern Abruzzo (at that time part of the Duchy of Spoleto) in 1140. King Roger II of Sicily sent his son Alfonso of Capua supported by his eldest son Roger III, Duke of Apulia, across the border at Pescara which overwhelmed the defensive forces against them. The resulting territory up to the Tronto River was then incorporated into the Kingdom of Sicily.Matthew, Donald, The Norman Kingdom of Sicily, University of Cambridge Press (1992) pp.53-54 Subsequently, Ulrich had difficulty maintaining and consolidating his power in Tuscany. After the death of Conrad in 1152, another member of the Welf family, Welf VI was named the Margrave of Tuscany and Duke of the remainder of Spoleto by Frederick I. ==See also== * Duke of Spoleto * List of rulers of Tuscany * * Norman conquest of southern Italy ==References== Category:1082 births Category:1170 deaths Category:Italian nobility ",
