Infrastructure was built and the suburb lay dormant until further developed by Delfin Property Group, assisted by the Defence Housing Authority in the 1990s.Delfin In 1992, the suburb's name was changed from Holsworthy Village to Wattle Grove. On 12 April 1992, Wattle Grove was officially opened by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.http://www.liverpool.nsw.gov.au/ourcity/historicaltimeline.htm Liverpool History In 2006, Wattle Grove's tree-lined streets underwent significant change.
