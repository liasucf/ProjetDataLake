He is one of the best known writers on the Perennial philosophy in the Portuguese language. His most recent book in English is Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), which won in the \"Comparative Religion\" category of The USA \"Best Books 2011\" Awards. He has translated into Portuguese, from the original French, several of the books of the perennialist master Frithjof Schuon (1907\u20131998). == Biography == Soares de Azevedo was born in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais state, to a family with roots in the historical city of Ouro Preto, where he lived his childhood. His family ancestors include Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, Minister of Justice and of Finance in the Brazilian Empire, and governor of the province of Minas Gerais, and Diogo de Vasconcelos, renowned historian and politician, author of Hist\u00f3ria M\u00e9dia de Minas Gerais. In S\u00e3o Paulo, he attended gymnasium and high school at Col\u00e9gio Santa Cruz, of French Canadian priests, and graduated in Literature and Journalism at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP). He has a graduate degree in international relations from George Washington University and holds a master's degree in History of religions from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, with a thesis on the contemporary relevance of the Perennial Philosophy. He is the author of seven books on the philosophical and mystical dimensions of Christianity and Islam, and about one hundred articles and essays dealing with the Perennial Philosophy and traditional spirituality in the contemporary world, several of them translated into English, French, and Spanish. His most recent book in English is Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), a critique both of religious and anti-religious fundamentalism; the later represented especially by polemicists such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. This book is the winner in the \"Comparative Religion\" category of The USA \"Best Books 2011\" Awards. It is also the ForeWord Book of the Year Award Finalist for \"Religion\", and Midwest Book Award Silver Medal for \"Current Events\". In Portuguese, his latest work is O Livro dos Mestres (The Book of Masters. S\u00e3o Paulo: Ibrasa, 2016), which is composed of outlines of the messages of around twenty spiritual masters of recent times, from diverse religious traditions. Another relatively recent book by Soares de Azevedo is Occultism and Religion in Freud, Jung, and Mircea Eliade, co-authored with the Australian author and professor Harry Oldmeadow.Published in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, by Ibrasa, 2011. He lived a year in London, England, in the 1980s, where he experienced the intellectual impact of the work of French metaphysician Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, which expounds a profound critique of modern materialism and relativism from a purely metaphysical perspective. In the 1990s, he lived a season in Washington, DC, and studied under William Stoddart, Rama Coomaraswamy, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr. There he deepened the study of the Perennial Philosophy and experienced the spiritual impact of the teachings of the German metaphysician and esoterist Frithjof Schuon. For Azevedo,See in this respect his \"Men of a Single Book\" (World Wisdom Books, 2010), especially the introduction and chapter one. the Perennial Philosophy casts a unique and contemporary light on the spiritual heritage of the peoples and updates the message of the traditional religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, giving to twenty-first century man a practical alternative to modern skepticism and intellectual confusion. It is noteworthy to grasp that the precursors of the Perennial Philosophy are sapiential masters such as Plato, Pythagoras, Shankara, and Meister Eckhart, and that the foundations of this school of thought are in pure Metaphysics, or in the \"nature of things\", not in one of the great Revelations, notwithstanding the fact that the Perennial Philosophy prescribes the need for personal attachment to one of the orthodox religious forms. Azevedo absorbed elements both from Gu\u00e9non and Schuon, as well as from William Stoddart, in his works, such as Men of a Single Book and Iniciaci\u00f3n al Islam y al Sufism.\"Iniciaci\u00f3n al Islam y al Sufism\", Barcelona, 2004. He is the editor of two anthologies published in the United States. The first is Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity And The Perennial Philosophy,Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity and The Perennial Philosophy catalog information at the publisher's website. featuring works by Frithjof Schuon, Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, Titus Burckhardt and other perennialists.
