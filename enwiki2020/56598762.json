    "text": "Esther E. Baldwin (November 8, 1840 \u2013 February 26, 1910), known as \"Chinese Champion\", was an American missionary, teacher, translator, writer, and editor. She understood the religious and political problems of China, and the Chinese people, as perhaps no other woman in this country did at that time. She labored constantly to bring about a better understanding between the two nations. Baldwin was courageous in her advocacy of whatever appeared to her to be true, by whomsoever it might chance to be condemned or approved. She served as president of the New York Woman's Missionary Society for two decades. ==Early years and education== Esther E. Jerman was born in Marlton, New Jersey, November 8, 1840. Her father, the Rev. Mathias Jerman, was for many years an honored and successful member of the New Jersey Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Esther was constitutionally frail, sensitive and studious. Her first schooling was given her at home, where was laid the foundation of all her future usefulness. To this was added instruction in the public schools and in an excellent private school in Salem, New Jersey, followed by a full course in Pennington Seminary, New Jersey. She was graduated from that institution in 1859, or 1860, taking the highest honors. Baldwin became a Christian at the age of ten, and united with the church of her parents. ==Career== In 1860, she became a teacher of higher mathematics, Latin and French in a seminary in Virginia. At the beginning of the Civil War her sympathies were with the North, and she resigned her position and returned home. In the summer of 1861 she met the Rev. Stephen Livingstone Baldwin, of the Foochow Mission, then at home on furlough, and in April, 1862, they were married, and sailed for China the following June, arriving in November, after five months at sea. Besides her domestic responsibilities, she was soon entrusted with the supervision of several day schools and of a class of Bible women who were sent out to read the Bible to their country-women. In her thoughtful survey of the condition of woman and childhood in China, quickened by her personal observation and experience, she became deeply impressed with the need of educated Christian woman physicians. She saw that through this means, access and confidence could be gained and the way opened for missionary work. She was the first to ask for a medical woman to be sent to China. When the hospital for women and children was opened in Foochow, the first for such a purpose founded in that empire, she gave it her cooperation. For several years she translated the Berean Lessons into the Chinese language for the use of the Methodist Mission and of the American Board. For two years, she edited in the same language the Youth's Illustrated Paper. She saw the missions grow from small beginnings into strong churches. After eighteen years of this work, she became gravely ill, and her physician declared that a change of climate and entire rest were essential to recovery. The American pulpit was freely open to Dr. Baldwin, and his pastonal services were eagerly sought. For some years, he was the recording secretary of the Board of Missions of the M. E. Church. Baldwin's health was largely restored since her return to the United States, and she spent her time in active benevolence. She was extensively employed in the interests of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, being president for two decades of the New York branch of that society in the Methodist Church, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in lectures on various subjects, and in many charities. She was an ardent advocate of the equality of women with men, both in the State and in the Church. The \"Chinese question\" in all its aspects had her sympathies. The misrepresentation and abuse of the Chinese kindled her indignation. She was called to speak before large audiences in many places on the \"Chinese question\" and contributed numerous articles on the subject to various city papers. She carefully collected and forcibly stated both the laws and the facts bearing on the subject, and published them in a volume entitled Must the Chinese Go? which had three editions. She won the distinction of being the \"Chinese Champion.\" Baldwin was one of the ablest debaters of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She spoke at Chautauqua in the early 1880s. ==Personal life== Baldwin was the mother of seven children, six of whom were born in Foochow, and two of whom died there. She died suddenly at the family home in Brooklyn, New York, February 26, 1910. ==References== ===Attribution=== * * ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== * Category:1840 births Category:1920 deaths Category:19th- century American writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:People from Evesham Township, New Jersey Category:American Methodist missionaries Category:Educators from New Jersey Category:American editors Category:American translators Category:Methodist Episcopal Church, South Category:Woman's Christian Temperance Union people Category:The Pennington School alumni Category:19th-century translators Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century Category:American expatriates in China ",
