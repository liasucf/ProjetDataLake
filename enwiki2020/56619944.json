    "text": "The 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was the 131st final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the culmination of the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in Gaelic football. The match was played at Croke Park in Dublin on 2 September 2018. It was the second time the teams had met in the final; Dublin won the first encounter in 1995. The final was shown live in Ireland on RT\u00c9 Two as part of The Sunday Game live programme, presented by Michael Lyster from Croke Park, with studio analysis from Joe Brolly, Pat Spillane, and Colm O'Rourke. Match commentary was provided by Ger Canning with analysis by Dessie Dolan. The game was also shown live on Sky Sports, presented by Rachel Wyse and Brian Carney. Dublin won the final by a margin of six points, on a scoreline of 2\u201317 to 1\u201314. The victory was Dublin's fourth consecutive All-Ireland title, making them the third county to win \"four-in-a-row\" (the others are Wexford in 1915\u201318 and Kerry in 1929\u201332 and 1978\u201381). This was the last occasion on which Michael Lyster presented RT\u00c9's television coverage, having decided to retire from The Sunday Game at the end of 2018. ==Paths to the final== ===Dublin=== ====Leinster Championship==== Dublin won the Leinster Championship and so advanced directly to the quarter-final group stage. ====All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s)==== Dublin finished first in Group 2 and advanced to the All- Ireland semi-final, to play the team who placed second in Group 1 - Galway. ====All-Ireland Semi-Final==== ===Tyrone=== ====Ulster Championship==== Having been beaten by Monaghan, Tyrone were eliminated from the Ulster championship and entered Round 1 of the All-Ireland qualifiers. ====All-Ireland Qualifiers==== ====All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s)==== Tyrone finished second in Group 2, behind Dublin, and advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final, to play the winner of Group 2, Monaghan. ====All-Ireland Semi- Final==== ==Pre-match== The match had originally been scheduled for 26 August, but had to be moved to accommodate the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland, where he attended the World Meeting of Families. The final had been moved from its traditional date of the third Sunday of September to allow more time for club matches. ===Tyrone's RT\u00c9 boycott=== On Monday 20 August 2018, just under two weeks before the final, the Irish Independent reported that RT\u00c9 had confirmed that Tyrone would not be involved in any media coverage with the national broadcaster surrounding the event. The boycott, considered a tradition at this stage in relation to Tyrone, involved for the first time an All-Ireland final, after which RT\u00c9 airs television coverage from the hotel in which the winning team is booked to stay. This meant that, in the event of a Tyrone win, RT\u00c9 would be unable to cover the after-match events as per usual, including interviews on the pitch with players and the management team. Tyrone's All- Ireland final boycott was a continuation of a seven-year blacklisting of RT\u00c9 by the county, the cause of which was a radio sketch aired in 2011 on RT\u00c9 Radio 1. The sketch incensed Tyrone, as it was deemed to be mocking Michaela Harte (daughter of Tyrone manager Mickey Harte), shortly after she was murdered while on honeymoon in Mauritius. Former All-Ireland winning captain Peter Canavan suggested the timing of RT\u00c9's announcement was intended to put pressure on Tyrone. ===Minor final=== Kerry played Galway in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final which took place before the senior final. Kerry won the game on a 0\u201321 to 1\u201314 scoreline to complete a five in a row of All Ireland wins. ===Jubilee team=== The Derry team that won the 1993 All- Ireland Final were presented to the crowd before the senior match to mark 25 years. ==Match== ===Officials=== On 20 August, Cork's Conor Lane was confirmed as the referee for the final. He was previously in charge of the drawn final between Dublin and Mayo in 2016. ===Team news=== Tyrone made one change to the team from the semi-final win over Monaghan with Mark Bradley starting ahead of Lee Brennan. Despite fears of an injury to Cian O'Sullivan, Dublin named an unchanged side, with the same starting fifteen that overcame Galway three weeks earlier. ===Summary=== Dublin began the game unchanged with Tyrone making 2 late changes - Rory Brennan and Conor Meyler replaced Frank Burns and Richie Donnelly. Prior to the game, Dublin, as reigning All-Ireland champions for three consecutive years, were heavy favourites to win. They took an early lead after Dean Rock scored a free, but he put his next two efforts wide, allowing Tyrone to assert dominance for fifteen minutes. During this timeframe, the Ulster team opened up a four-point lead, with the score poised at 0\u201305 to 0\u201301 in favour of Mickey Harte's side. However, the tide of the game turned once more in a dramatic, as Paul Mannion was fouled in Tyrone's penalty box, leading Conor Lane to award a penalty to Dublin, which Mannion calmly slotted home. Coupled with another successful free from Rock, this left the teams equal with five points apiece. Tyrone only managed to secure one more point in the remaining twenty-four minutes of the half, and their lack of clinicality in front of goal opened the door to a resurgent Dublin side. In the twenty-eighth minute, Dublin pulled further ahead courtesy of another goal. Con O'Callaghan took the ball deep into Tyrone territory before offloading to Niall Scully, who calmly fisted it into Niall Morgan's unguarded net. Thus, the teams headed in at half-time with Dublin seven points to the good, having racked up 2\u201307 to Tyrone's 0\u201306. While Tyrone reduced the deficit by two early in the second half, with points from Connor McAliskey and Kieran McGeary narrowing Dublin's margin somewhat, the team in blue, affectionately known as \"the Dubs\", had accumulated an unassailable lead. The second thirty- five minutes were not entirely without incident, however; Dublin had pulled further out of sight, with points from Ciaran Kilkenny and Brian Fenton further diminishing whatever minuscule chances Tyrone had at mounting a comeback. However, in the sixty-sixth minute, Tyrone were given a late opportunity to draw near again, as Philly McMahon brought down Colm Cavanagh with a rash challenge, granting Tyrone a penalty - this was coolly dispatched by Peter Harte, breaching Stephen Cluxton's net for the first time in the game. Later, John Small was given a second yellow card, and ergo sent off, leaving Dublin to finish with just fourteen men. Ultimately, a point at the death from Kevin McManamon put the victory beyond any doubt. Conor Lane, the County Cork native, blew the final whistle, confirming Dublin's victory with a margin of six points. The final score was 2\u201317 to 1\u201314. The man of the match award was bestowed upon Jack McCaffrey, who received the award ahead of his other nominated teammates, Kilkenny and Mannion. As captain, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton, making his 200th appearance for the county, lifted the Sam Maguire Cup aloft from the Hogan Stand. The win represented Dublin's fourth consecutive win under the management of Jim Gavin, a feat only previously achieved by two other counties - Kerry and Wexford. It also further extended Dublin's unbeaten run in the Championship; the side was last beaten in 2014. ===Details=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%;\" |- |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1|| Stephen Cluxton (c) |- |CB ||2|| Philly McMahon || |- |FB ||3|| Cian O'Sullivan || |- |CB ||4|| Eoin Murchan || |- |WB ||5|| John Small || |- |HB ||6|| Jonny Cooper || |- |WB ||7|| Jack McCaffrey || |- |MF ||8|| Brian Fenton || |- |MF ||9|| James McCarthy || |- |WF ||10|| Niall Scully || |- |HF ||11|| Con O'Callaghan || |- |FW ||12|| Brian Howard |- |CF ||13|| Paul Mannion || |- |FF ||14|| Ciar\u00e1n Kilkenny || |- |CF ||15|| Dean Rock || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||16|| Evan Comerford || |- |FW ||17|| Paddy Andrews |- |FW ||18|| Colm Basquel || |- |FW ||19|| Cormac Costello || |- |DF ||20|| Darren Daly || |- |DF ||21|| Michael Fitzsimons || |- |FW ||22|| Paul Flynn || |- |DF ||23|| Eric Lowndes || |- |MF ||24|| Michael Darragh MacAuley || |- |FW ||25|| Kevin McManamon || |- |FW ||26|| Eoghan O'Gara || |- |colspan=3| Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"|Jim Gavin |} |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1|| Niall Morgan || |- |CB ||2|| Michael McKernan || |- |FB ||3|| Ronan McNamee || |- |CB ||4|| P\u00e1draig Hampsey || |- |WB ||5|| Tiernan McCann || |- |HB ||18|| Rory Brennan || |- |WB ||7|| Peter Harte || |- |MF ||8|| Colm Cavanagh || |- |MF ||9|| Cathal McShane || |- |WF ||10|| Mattie Donnelly (c) || |- |HF ||11|| Niall Sludden || |- |WF ||12|| Kieran McGeary || |- |CF ||13|| Mark Bradley || |- |FF ||25|| Conor Meyler || |- |CF ||15|| Connor McAliskey || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||16|| Michael O'Neill || |- |DF ||6|| Frank Burns || |- |FW ||14|| Richard Donnelly|| |- |FW ||17|| Lee Brennan || |- |DF ||19|| Michael Cassidy || |- |FW ||20|| Harry Loughran || |- |MF ||21|| Conal McCann || |- |FW ||22|| Declan McClure || |- |DF ||23|| Aidan McCrory || |- |DF ||24|| HP McGeary || |- |FW ||26|| Ronan O'Neill || |- |colspan=3| Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"|Mickey Harte |- |} |- |} {| width=100% style=\"font- size: 100%\" | Man of the Match: Jack McCaffrey |} ===Trophy presentation=== Dublin captain Stephen Cluxton accepted the Sam Maguire Cup from GAA president John Horan in the Hogan Stand. ===Reaction=== Highlights of the final were shown on The Sunday Game programme which aired at 9:30 pm that night on RT\u00c9 Two and was presented by Des Cahill.
