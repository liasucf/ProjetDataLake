He served as the second First secretary of the Central Committee of the Byelorussian SSR from 1920 to 1923 and from 1927 to 1928. He was executed in the Great Purge as a part of the so-called \"Latvian Operation\". Being a Moscow-appointed de facto head of state of Belarus, Knorin is known for his notorious quote about the Belarusian independence: \"We believe that Belarusians are not a nation, and the ethnographic specifics, which differentiate them from Russians, must be erased. We, communists, in the region that you call Belarus, work without thinking of what tribe we are.\" A street in Minsk is named after Knorin. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1939 deaths Category:People from Amata Municipality Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia Category:Russian Social Democratic Labour Party members Category:Communist Party of Poland politicians Category:Old Bolsheviks Category:Latvian communists Category:Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia people Category:Heads of the Communist Party of Byelorussia Category:Latvian Operation of the NKVD Category:Great Purge victims from Latvia Category:Executed politicians Category:Soviet rehabilitations ",
