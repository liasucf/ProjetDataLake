He is good friends with former UFC veteran and Norwegian Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist John Olav Einemo.http://www.tri- coasta.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=173%3Aoslo&catid;=1%3Alatest- news&Itemid;=1 ==Mixed martial arts career== ===FinnFight and Shooto=== Joachim \"Hellboy\" Hansen began his career fighting for Finnish promotion FinnFight before moving on to fight for Shooto's Finnish branch. His performance got him invited to Shooto's year-end show in 2002 where he, with a 3\u20131 record, faced Takumi Nakayama who at the time had 14 fights under his belt. Hansen won a majority decision. Hansen's performance impressed Shooto- veteran Rumina Sato who challenged Hansen after the match. Three months later the two met, with Hansen defeating the Japanese fighter two minutes into the bout by TKO. The win set him up for a title shot against the Shooto Lightweight Champion, and at the time 14\u20130, Takanori Gomi. The fight went the distance with Hansen being awarded a majority decision, making him the Shooto Lightweight Champion and first Scandinavian person to hold a MMA world title. Hansen's first title defense was against another undefeated fighter in V\u00edtor Ribeiro who took away Hansen's title by submitting him two minutes into the second round. ===Pride Fighting championships=== Hansen went on to win his next seven fights, most notably against Gesias Calvancanti, Caol Uno, Masakazu Imanari and Yves Edwards, before losing a decision to Hayato Sakurai in the semi-finals of the Pride 2005 Lightweight tournament. He then challenged Tatsuya Kawajiri for the Shooto Welterweight Championship, but lost by disqualification due to a kick to the groin of Kawajiri. Hansen then went 2\u20132 in his next four fights, losing to Shinya Aoki and Eiji Mitsuoka, before his next big win against Kazuyuki Miyata at K-1 Premium 2007 Dynamite!!. ===Dream=== On 15 March 2008 Hansen entered Dream's 16-man 2008 Lightweight Grand-Prix tournament. In the first round of the tournament he faced and defeated Japanese fighter Kotetsu Boku by unanimous decision at Dream 1. The win set him up for a quarterfinal bout against Eddie Alvarez, at Dream 3. Hansen and Alvarez were given a standing ovation for their \"outstanding fights\" by the entire crowd after their match.K-1 official profile or an article of kamipro After a close fight Alvarez was awarded a unanimous decision and advanced to the Dream 5: Lightweight Grand Prix 2008 Final Round. The fight was described by MMAWeekly as \"a fifteen-minute war\" and that it would be a \"fight of the year candidate\", while Sherdog called it a \"riveting 15-minute war\" and an \"epic battle\". At Dream 5 Hansen defeated Kultar Gill in a reserve bout for the tournament. This became Hansen's ticket to the final after Alvarez, who went on to defeat Tatsuya Kawajiri in the semi-final, but was forced to withdraw due to a cut under his right eye. In the final, Hansen faced Japanese submission-specialist Shinya Aoki, who had previously defeated Hansen at Pride Shockwave 2006. In the fight Aoki used his grappling experience to try and submit Hansen after taking him down, but the Norwegian escaped and responded with powerful ground-and-pound which hurt Aoki and eventually forced the referee to step in. The win made Hansen the 2008 Dream Lightweight Grand Prix Champion and the first ever Dream Lightweight Champion. After the bout Hansen told the crowd he wanted his first title defense to be against Eddie Alvarez whom he replaced, and who had previously eliminated him from the tournament. Hansen's next fight was set to be against Gesias Calvancante at Dynamite!! 2008 on 31 December 2008, but the bout was canceled the day of the event due to Hansen not passing pre-fight medicals and subsequently being hospitalized for a \"head injury\". It was later clarified that the injury stemmed from a teammate landing awkwardly on Hansen's head after a takedown during warm-up, resulting with Hansen being rushed to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion.
