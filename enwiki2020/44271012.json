Pasqualini and Bur published the first case of eunuchoidism with preserved spermatogenesis in 1950 in la Revista de la Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Argentina.Pasqualini RQ, Bur GE.

The hypoandrogenism with spermatogenesis syndrome included: (a) eunuchoidism, (b) testis with normal spermatogenesis and full volume, with mature spermatozoids in a high proportion of seminiferous tubes and undifferentiated and immature Leydig cells (c) full functional compensation through the administration of chorionic gonadotropin hormone, while hCG is administered (d) total urinary gonadotrophins within normal limits (e) this definition implies the normal activity of the pituitary and the absence of congenital malformations in general. In describing five other similar cases in 1953, Mc Cullagh & al McCullagh EP, Beck JC, Schaffenburg CA: A syndrome of eunuchoidism with spermatogenesis, normal urinary FSH and low or normal ICSH: (\u201cFertile eunuchs\u201d).

J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1953; 13: 128. coined the term fertile eunuch introducing it in the English literature. Unfortunately, this term is incorrect and should not be employed. Indeed, these patients are not really eunuchs. Moreover, as it will be explained later, they are not usually fertile if not treated. A first step in the understanding of the physiopathology of Pasqualini syndrome was the absence of Lutheinizing Hormone (LH) in plasma and urine of patients. The second breakthrough was the functional and genetic studies that validated the hypothesis of a functional deficit of LH in these men. Inactivating LH mutations will then also be described in some women. Different groups Weiss J, Axelrod L, Whitcomb RW, Harris PE, Crowley WF, Jameson JL.

Finally, the full comprehension of Pasqualini syndrome allowed to reverse the hypoandrogenic phenotype and to restore fertility in these patients through the use of chorionic gonadotropin and the modern in-vitro fertility techniques Valdes-Socin H, Salvi R, Thiry A, Daly AF, Pralong FP, Gaillard R et al.
