    "text": "King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band is a live album by Ringo Starr released on 6 August 2002. ==Overview== Starr's All-Starr Band was always evolving. While Mark Rivera remained from the previous band, the new players for the 2001 US tour here include Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Greg Lake, Mott the Hoople's Ian Hunter and - bringing a more updated sound to the precedings - Supertramp's Roger Hodgson, Howard Jones and former Prince bandmember Sheila E.. Starr naturally has the biggest share of the songs, performing his classic hits from the 1960s and 1970s - with the relatively recent \"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\" from 1992's Time Takes Time, with all his celebrity guests each having their moment in the spotlight. ==Reception== King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band was fairly well received by the critics upon its August 2002 release, though again, it failed to reach the charts. ==Track listing== #\"Photograph\" (Richard Starkey/George Harrison) \u2013 4:21 #\"Act Naturally\" (Voni Morrison/Johnny Russell) \u2013 2:32 #\"Logical Song\" (Rick Davies/Roger Hodgson) \u2013 3:55 #* Performed by Roger Hodgson #\"No One Is to Blame\" (Howard Jones) \u2013 6:11 #* Performed by Howard Jones #\"Yellow Submarine\" (Lennon\u2013McCartney) \u2013 3:07 #\"Give a Little Bit\" (Rick Davies/Roger Hodgson) \u2013 5:13 #* Performed by Roger Hodgson #\"You're Sixteen\" (Richard Sherman/Bob Sherman) \u2013 2:37 #\"The No-No Song\" (Hoyt Axton/David Jackson) \u2013 3:20 #\"Back Off Boogaloo\" (Richard Starkey) \u2013 3:57 #\"Glamorous Life\" (Prince) \u2013 9:18 #* Performed by Sheila E. #\"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (Lennon\u2013McCartney) \u2013 4:01 #\"Lucky Man\" (Greg Lake) \u2013 4:44 #* Performed by Greg Lake #\"Take the Long Way Home\" (Rick Davies/Roger Hodgson) \u2013 4:44 #* Performed by Roger Hodgson #\"All the Young Dudes\" (David Bowie) \u2013 5:35 #* Performed by Ian Hunter #\"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\" (Richard Starkey/Johnny Warman/Gary Grainger) \u2013 4:39 #\"With a Little Help from My Friends\" (Lennon\u2013McCartney) \u2013 5:34 ==References== ; Footnotes ; Citations Category:2002 live albums Category:Ringo Starr live albums Category:Albums produced by Ringo Starr ",
