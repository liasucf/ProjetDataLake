    "text": "Zubeiru or Zubayru bi Adama (died 1903) was a ruler of the Adamawa Emirate founded by his father, Modibo Adama. By the time he came to the throne in 1890, the emirate was threatened by the Germans, French and English. Zubeiru attempted \"a hopeless, though spirited, rearguard action\" against European attrition of the emirate. ==Life== His rule was weakened by war against Hayatu ibn Sa'id and then attempts to resist the Royal Niger Company and British administration under Frederick Lugard. In 1901 he was forced to flee Yola and become an exiled renegade. ==References== Category:Cameroonian traditional rulers Category:Nigerian traditional rulers Category:African slave traders Category:19th-century births Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1903 deaths Category:19th-century businesspeople ",
