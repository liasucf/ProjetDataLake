It is located in the centre of the city, overlooking Luanda Bay. ==History== The church was built in 1664 by Governor Andr\u00e9 Vidal de Negreiros (1606\u20131680) in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for safeguarding his ship during a storm which occurred while he was travelling to Angola. A plaque on the wall, however, indicates it was in fact dedicated to victory at the Battle of Ambuila in 1665. The building was reconstructed in the late 19th century. ==Architecture== The little church consists of a rather austere rectangular nave and chancel built in a simple Baroque architecture style. The original plans show that the facade was to be flanked by two towers but these were never built. Instead, there is only a small bell tower. The church was listed as a national monument under Decree No. 135 of 28 June 1932. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Luanda Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1664 Category:1664 establishments in the Portuguese Empire Category:1664 establishments in Africa ",
