It was put into orbit in May 2018 and was deployed from the International Space Station on June 25, 2018. It is currently in orbit. It is used to track large storms. == Mission objectives == RainCube's mission objectives are to: * Demonstrate low- cost Ka band radar technology, with a vertical resolution of 250m and a horizontal resolution of at least 10km. Its radar sensitivity should also be better than 20dBZ. * Use Ka-band radar from a 6U CubeSat * Profiling precipitation falling on Earth == Gallery == File:CubeSat RainCube flightsystem.jpg|RaInCube on Earth File:CubeSat RainCube radar.jpg|RaInCube's interior File:Secondary antennas4.gif|RaInCube's antenna opening == See also == * CubeSat * Weather radar * International Space Station == References == == External links == * RainCube page by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Category:Satellites deployed from the International Space Station Category:CubeSats ",
