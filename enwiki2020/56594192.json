Presley had the most top 10 entries this year, with five in total. The Everly Brothers spent seven weeks at number-one in the UK with \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\"/\"Claudette\", which lasted fifteen weeks in the top 10 altogether. Connie Francis made her UK top 10 debut in April with her first single release, \"Who's Sorry Now?\", which spent six weeks at number-one. The follow-up, \"Stupid Cupid\", also topped the chart for six weeks. The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1958, as well as singles which peaked in 1957 and 1959 but were in the top 10 in 1958. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). Eighty-four singles were in the top ten in 1958. Ten singles from 1957 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\" by Perry Como, \"Tea for Two Cha Cha\" by The Tommy Dorsey Orchestra starring Warren Covington and \"Tom Dooley\" by The Kingston Trio were all released in 1958 but did not reach their peak until 1959. \"All the Way\"/\"Chicago\" by Frank Sinatra, \"Let's Have a Ball\" by Winifred Atwell, \"My Special Angel\" by Malcolm Vaughan and \"Reet Petite (The Sweetest Girl in Town)\" by Jackie Wilson were the singles from 1957 to reach their peak in 1958. Twenty artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1958. Cliff Richard, Connie Francis, Marty Wilde, Michael Holliday and Ricky Nelson were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1958. The 1957 Christmas number-one, \"Mary's Boy Child\" by Harry Belafonte, remained at number-one for the first two weeks of 1958. The first new number-one single of the year was \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis. Overall, thirteen different singles peaked at number-one in 1958, with Connie Francis (2) having the most singles hit that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== Eighty-four singles charted in the top 10 in 1958, with seventy-five singles reaching their peak this year. Six songs were recorded by several artists with each version reaching the top 10: *\"Come Prima\" - Marino Marini & His Quartet, Malcolm Vaughan with The Michael Sammes Singers (version known as \"More Than Ever (Come Prima)\") *\"Kewpie Doll\" - Frankie Vaughan, Perry Como *\"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\" - Frankie Vaughan, Jimmie Rodgers *\"Lollipop\" - The Chordettes, The Mudlarks *\"Tom Dooley\" - The Kingston Trio, Lonnie Donegan *\"Volare\" - Dean Martin, Domenico Modugno Twenty artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1958.

Michael Holliday was one of a number of artists with two top-ten entries, including the number-one single \"The Story of My Life\". Frankie Vaughan, Jerry Lee Lewis, Lonnie Donegan and Ricky Nelson were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1958. ===Chart debuts=== Thirty-four artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1958, either as a lead or featured artist.
