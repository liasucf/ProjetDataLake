In 1990, the Green Party split into three parties, with Lord remaining a member of the Green Party of England and Wales. Lord is a campaigner for basic income, writing in 1993 that: \"I'm afraid I cannot retire from Green politics until the significance of the Basic Income is understood and taken for granted on all sides: it will enable us to emerge from recession without returning to indiscriminate economic growth that will destroy itself, and us with it.\" In 2003, he published a book, A Citizens' Income: A Foundation for a Sustainable World, which outlined his personal philosophy and political beliefs. In 2012, he co-edited a second book, Citizen\u2019s Income and Green Economics.Citizens' Income and Green Economics, ed. by Clive Lord, Miriam Kennet and Judith Felton (Reading: Green Economics Institute Reading, 2012), . In June 2016, Lord announced his intentions to stand for Leader of the Green Party in the upcoming 2016 leadership election. In his election statement, he stated that he wanted Andrew Cooper, who ended up standing for Deputy Leader, to be Leader. ==Electoral performance== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Date of election !
