    "text": "The 2014\u201315 Las Vegas Legends season was the third season of the Las Vegas Legends professional indoor soccer club. The Las Vegas Legends, a Pacific Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, split their home games between the Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada, and the Las Vegas Sports Park in Las Vegas, Nevada. The team was led by owner Meir Cohen and head coach Doug Borgel with assistant coach Peter Sharkey. The Legends earned a 13\u20137 record in the regular season, placing them third in the Pacific Division and in the playoffs. They defeated the Ontario Fury and San Diego Sockers to win the Pacific Division Final before losing to the Monterrey Flash in the Western Conference Championship. ==Season summary== Las Vegas struggled to start the season, earning a shootout win at home over the Turlock Express then losing twice on the road to the San Diego Sockers (with an at-home loss to the Missouri Comets in between). The Legends beat the Sockers at Orleans Arena then dropped games to the Ontario Fury and Turlock. Finding their footing in mid-December, Las Vegas won 5 consecutive games, including a two-goal win over then-unbeaten Monterrey Flash at Arena Monterrey. A stumble in January saw the Legends lose 2 of 3 games but they finished the season with 5 straight wins (including a win over the then-unbeaten Baltimore Blast) to end the regular season with a 137 record. This was good enough for third place in the Pacific Division and a spot in the post-season. They defeated Ontario then San Diego to claim the Pacific Division crown and moved on to the MASL Western Conference championship against Monterrey but lost both home and road games, ending their playoff run. ==History== The Legends, a Professional Arena Soccer League expansion team in 2012\u201313, were successful in the 2012\u201313 season, compiling a 13\u20133 record in the regular season and clinching the Southwestern Division title. The team advanced to the postseason but ultimately fell to the San Diego Sockers 6\u20135 in overtime in the PASL National Championship Semi- Finals. They found equal success in the 2013\u201314 season, earning a 13\u20133 record and 1st place in the PASL's Pacific Division. In the post-season, they defeated the San Diego Sockers in the Pacific Division Final to advance to the PASL Final Four but fell to Hidalgo La Fiera in the Semi-Final match. They defeated the Cleveland Freeze in the consolation game to take third place overall in the league. ==Off-field moves== In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, the other Pacific teams for 2014\u201315 are California-based Ontario Fury, Sacramento Surge, San Diego Sockers, and Turlock Express plus the Washington-based Seattle Impact. The Impact's assets were purchased mid-season and the team replaced on the schedule by the Tacoma Stars. On March 17, 2015, after Las Vegas was eliminated from the playoffs, owner Meir Cohen told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he planned for Las Vegas to return next season but with a new head coach and a new playing venue. Cohen wants the Legends to split playing time at the Thomas & Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus with the new Las Vegas Outlaws of the Arena Football League. ==Roster moves== In advance of the February 1 league trade deadline, the Detroit Waza traded team owner and player Dominic Scicluna to the Legends. Scicluna also served as an assistant coach with Las Vegas. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"170\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"110\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 12 | 3:05pm | Mexican National Indoor Team | W 5\u20133 | 1\u20130 | Orleans Arena | 2,275 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 2 | Sunday | October 19 | 1:00pm | at US National Indoor Team | L 6\u20137 | 1\u20131 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 4,200 |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"190\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"130\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 26 | 3:00pm | Turlock Express | W 7\u20136 (SO) | 1\u20130 | Orleans Arena | 1,125 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 1 | 7:05pm | at San Diego Sockers | L 4\u20135 (OT) | 1\u20131 | Valley View Casino Center | 3,816 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 3 | Sunday | November 9 | 3:00pm | Monterrey Flash | L 2\u20133 | 1\u20132 | Orleans Arena | 1,970 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 4 | Thursday | November 20 | 7:35pm | at San Diego Sockers | L 2\u20137 | 1\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 1,922 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 5 | Sunday | November 23 | 3:00pm | San Diego Sockers | W 9\u20137 | 2\u20133 | Orleans Arena | 1,377 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 6 | Tuesday | December 2 | 7:00pm | Ontario Fury | L 7\u20138 | 2\u20134 | Orleans Arena | 860 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 7 | Friday | December 12 | 7:35pm | at Turlock Express | L 5\u20136 | 2\u20135 | Turlock Soccer Complex | 532 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | December 13 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 13\u20137 | 3\u20135 | McClellan Park | 435 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 9 | Friday | December 19 | 7:35pm | at Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 7\u20136 | 4\u20135 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 200 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 10 | Sunday | December 21 | 5:05pm | at Monterrey Flash | W 8\u20136 | 5\u20135 | Arena Monterrey | 2,684 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Tuesday | December 30 | 7:00pm | Turlock Express | W 7\u20135 | 6\u20135 | Orleans Arena | 1,997 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 12 | Saturday | January 3 | 7:05pm | at Ontario Fury | W 11\u20138 | 7\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,024 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 13 | Sunday | January 11 | 5:05pm | at Turlock Express | L 7\u20138 (OT) | 7\u20136 | Turlock Soccer Complex | 517 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Friday | January 16 | 7:00pm | Sacramento Surge | W 18\u20134 | 8\u20136 | Orleans Arena | 1,555 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 18 | 3:05pm | at Ontario Fury | L 5\u20136 | 8\u20137 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,038 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 16 | Sunday | January 25 | 4:00pm | at Tacoma Stars | W 13\u20133 | 9\u20137 | ShoWare Center | 1,015 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 17 | Friday | January 30 | 7:00pm | Tacoma Stars | W 11\u20132 | 10\u20137 | Las Vegas Sports Park | 675 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 18 | Friday | February 6 | 7:00pm | Baltimore Blast | W 5\u20134 (OT) | 11\u20137 | Orleans Arena | 2,028 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 19 | Friday | February 13 | 7:00pm | San Diego Sockers | W 8\u20135 | 12\u20137 | Orleans Arena | 2,311 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 20 | Sunday | February 22 | 1:05pm | Sacramento Surge | W 22\u20133 | 13\u20137 | Las Vegas Sports Park | 792 |} Seattle Impact shut down mid- season; franchise purchased by Tacoma Stars.
