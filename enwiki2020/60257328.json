While in the Assembly, he was the secretary to the Hoboken Board of Education, a position he held until 1979. He was married to the former Adelaide Witt and had a total of four children. In September 1972, District 12-C Assemblyman Silvio Failla was murdered in a robbery, leaving one seat vacant. Gallo ran as a Democrat first in the December 18, 1972 special primary election; he was successful against four other Democrats. In the January 8, 1973 special election, he ran against Republican Nilo Juri and defeated him. The next year, Gallo ran in the new 33rd district alongside Christopher Jackman. The two men would be elected to the General Assembly for the next five terms from the same district until Gallo retired prior to the 1983 elections. A life-long resident of Hoboken, he died at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune Township, New Jersey on December 9, 1994, shortly after turning 80 years old. He was survived by his wife and children. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Hoboken High School alumni Category:New Jersey city council members Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:Politicians from Hoboken, New Jersey Category:Rutgers University\u2013Newark alumni Category:20th-century American politicians ",
