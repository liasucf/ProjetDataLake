People often mistake CADE for the much more mature artist \"CVDE\" from South Africa. While originally from Tampa, Florida, he is best known for his music on Spotify and his work with artists including Cheat Codes, Lauv, and Jennifer Lopez . ==Career== Cade launched his solo endeavors with EP, 'Care', which was released in July 2016 through Spinnin' Records. Cade was recognized by Billboard for his music, and mentioned that he feels that his sound \"mixes the emotion of R&B; music with the dynamic elements of electronic dance music..\" A song from the EP, titled \"Care\" was produced by Cheat Codes' Trevor Dahl, who is a good friend of Larson. \"Care\" quickly turned the heads and garnered support from the likes of The Chainsmokers, Pia Mia, etc. In 2017, he collaborated with pop trio, Cheat Codes, to remix Maggie Lindemann\u2019s \"Pretty Girl\", which resulted in over 600 million streams on Spotify, achieving Platinum certification in the US, and platinum certification in the UK. Later in the year, CADE and Cheat Codes collaborated again on \"Stay with You\", and Dagny\u2019s, \"Wearing Nothing (Cheat Codes X CADE Remix)\". Now with over 8 million monthly listeners, CADE continues to reach a wide audience by opening for artists like Mike Posner, Jeremih, Kesha, Juicy J, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike. CADE's recent collaboration with Cheat Codes titled \"Stay with You\" charted on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, peaking at 35 on the US Dance chart. On June 23, CADE announced signing a record deal with ULTRA MUSIC/Sony. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Care | * Released: July 22, 2016 * Format: Digital download * Label: Source (Spinnin' Records) |- ! scope=\"row\"| Warning Sign | * Released: April 20, 2018 * Format: Digital download * Label: Spinnin' Records |} ===Charted singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| US Dance |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Stay with You\" | 2017 | 35 | |} ===Other singles=== 2016 * Care (SOURCE) * Make You Feel Loved (SOURCE) * Monopoly (with Mokita) (Armada Trice) * Let Me Love You (Dastic featuring CADE) (Spinnin' Records) 2017 * Can't Take It (Breathe Carolina and Bassjackers featuring CADE) (Spinnin' Records) * Sorry for Myself (Spinnin' Records) * Give It to You (Niko the Kid and Bee's Knees featuring CADE) (Armada Trice) * Done with You (Boehm featuring Cade) (Armada Deep) * Stay with You (with Cheat Codes) (300 Entertainment) * Where We Left (SOURCE) * I Know You Know (featuring TK Kravitz) (CADE Music) * Thinkin' Bout Myself (with CMC$) (STMPD RCRDS) 2018 * Warning Sign (Spinnin' Records) ==References== Category:Musicians from Tampa, Florida Category:Spinnin' Records artists Category:Living people Category:American electronic musicians Category:1996 births CADE (2018) Photo by Cameron Postforoosh.
