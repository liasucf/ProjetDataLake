Club gave the episode a B+, saying, \"After a lengthy hiatus, \u201cItty Bitty Ditty Committee\u201d feels like Bob\u2019s Burgers just sort of easing back into things. It\u2019s a reliably funny, charming episode that builds to a terrific crescendo, with the kids\u2019 storefront concert actually bringing together usual Belcher nemeses like Edith and Jimmy Pesto\u2019s lackey Trev in support of the kids. Taken with the reprise of \u201cBurgers And Fries\u201d over the closing credits, it all adds up to a fine reaffirmation that Bob\u2019s Burgers just doing what comes naturally represents one of the most enjoyable half-hours on TV.\" The episode received a 0.9 rating and was watched by a total of 2.04 million people. This made it the fifth most watched show on Fox that night, behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, The Simpsons, and The Last Man on Earth. ==References== == External links == * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 5) episodes ",
