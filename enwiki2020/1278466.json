    "text": "Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland (later Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth), from the 14th century to the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. It was part of the historic Kujawy region and the Greater Polish prowincja. Originally, its name was Brzesc Voivodeship (Wojewodztwo brzeskie), but after the 1569 Union of Lublin, it was renamed into Brzesc Kujawski Voivodeship, to distinguish it from Lithuanian Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (Polish: Wojewodztwo brzesko-litewskie). ==Geography== Its area was 3,276 sq. kilometers, divided into five counties. The seat of the voivode was at Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski, while local sejmiks for both Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski and Inowroc\u0142aw Voivodeships took place at Radziejow. It was one of the smallest and most densely populated voivodeships of the Commonwealth. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship: > \u201cEast of the land of the Polans lies the region of Kujawy, most of which > stretches along left bank of the Vistula. The region was divided into two > voivodeships: those of Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski, and Inowroc\u0142aw. Third part of > historic Kujawy, the Dobrzyn Land, lies on the right bank of the Vistula. > Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, while writing his testament in 1138, united Kujawy > and Mazovia, giving it to his son Boleslaw IV the Curly (...) The dynasty of > Mazovian Piasts lasted until the 16th century, while the Kujawian Piasts > died out in the 14th century. As a result, Kujawy returned to the Crown of > the Kingdom of Poland in 1434, two hundred years before Mazovia. It is not > known when the province was divided into two voivodeships, but in Horodlo in > 1413 (see Union of Horodlo), two Kujawian voivodes were already present: > Maciej of Labiszyn was the voivode of Brze\u015b\u0107, and Janusz of Koscieliska was > the voivode of Gniewkowo, later Inowroc\u0142aw (...) > The area of Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship was almost 60 sq. miles, with 67 > Roman-Catholic parishes, 13 towns and 567 villages. It was divided into five > counties: Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski, Radziejow, Przedecz, Kowal and Kruszwica. All > counties were among the smallest in the Province of Greater Poland, as > Przedecz County had the area of 9 sq. miles, while Kruszwica County was even > smaller, with 6 sq. miles. At the same time, however, Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski > Voivodeship (together with \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship) was most densely populated > of all voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its population > density in the 16th century reached 1,200, even 1,300 people per sq. mile > (...) > Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship had six senators. These were: The Bishop of > Kujawy, the Voivode and the Castellan of Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski, as well as > Castellans of Kruszwica, Kowal and Konary. Starostas resided in capitals of > the five counties, plus at Nieszawa and Dunikow. Since both Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski > and Inowroc\u0142aw voivodeships were part of Kujawy, local sejmiks for them took > place at Radziejow. Here, four deputies to the Sejm were elected, and two > deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal. Both voivodeships shared one coat > of arms\u201d. ==Administration== Governor seat: * Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Regional council (sejmik) seats: * Radziejow Counties * Brzesc Kujawski County, * Kowal County, * Kruszwica County, * Przedecz County, * Radziejow County.
