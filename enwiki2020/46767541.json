Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol.1 p.203 There was also an established de Kerdiff family in Cork, although it is unclear if the two families were related.Tuckey, Francis The Cork Remembrancer 1837 The bridge now called \"Cardiff's Bridge\" on the River Tolka was named for the family. ==Landowner== Walter was the principal landowner in Finglas in the last years of the reign of Henry VIII,Ball, F. Elrington History of the County Dublin Volume 6 Alexander and Thom and Co (Dublin 1920) Vol. 6 Chapter 6. and later owned lands at Castleknock, Pelletstown (modern Blanchardstown) and Turvey in County Dublin, and at Shallan in County Meath. He claimed ownership of lands at Dowth, also in County Meath, which led to a lawsuit in 1555 with another High Court judge, Luke Netterville, who was the head of an old-established landowning family from Dowth. Kerdiff's ownership of such extensive lands suggests that, like most of his colleagues, he had acquired considerable wealth from the Dissolution of the Monasteries, although Kenny notes that there is no firm evidence of this.Kenny, Colum King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1994 p.33 ==Judge== Walter was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1535, and served until 1558. He was one of the Irish judges who signed a petition to King Henry VIII in 1541 asking for the legal title to the King's Inn to be vested in the petitioners.Kenny p.33 He died about 1564.Ball p.203 ==References== Category:Irish people of Welsh descent Category:People from Finglas Category:Justices of the Irish Common Pleas Category:1564 deaths ",
