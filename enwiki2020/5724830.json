    "text": "Brigadier Andrew Terence Juxon-Smith (30 November 1931 \u2013 1996) was a politician and military officer in Sierra Leone. He was briefly (27 March 1967 to 18 April 1968) Chairman of the National Reformation Council and acting Governor-General, equivalent to head of the Sierra Leonean state. He was additionally Minister of Finance of Sierra Leone. He and the Council were overthrown in April 1968 by a group of low-level military officials led by John Amadu Bangura that restored Sierra Leone to rule by parliament under Siaka Stevens. He was a member of the Creole people, though he also had Sherbro and Mende ancestry. He later moved to the United States and died in Stapleton, New York. Juxon-Smith's life is the subject of the short documentary 'A Forgotten Past', directed by Andreas Hadjipateras in 2018. ==References== ==External links== * History of Sierra Leone Category:1931 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Category:People from Freetown Category:Sierra Leonean politicians Category:Sierra Leonean military personnel Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Governors-General of Sierra Leone Category:Sierra Leone Creole people Category:Prime Ministers of Sierra Leone Category:Finance ministers of Sierra Leone ",
