    "text": "Charles Theophile de Jaeger (27 February 1911 - 19 May 2000) was a cameraman for the BBC. He is best known as one of the creators of a famous April Fools' Day joke from 1957: a three-minute spoof report on the Swiss spaghetti harvest beside Lake Lugano broadcast by the British current affairs programme Panorama. ==Early years== De Jaeger was born in Vienna. He worked for the Free French Film Unit during World War II and joined the BBC in July 1943, working as a sub-editor on news for Central Europe. He became a television cameraman in 1948. He was the first BBC newsreel cameraman to film outside the United Kingdom. ==April Fools 1957== The idea for the April Fool came from his school days, during which a teacher had once said \"Boys, you are so stupid, you'd believe me if I told you that spaghetti grew on trees\". He developed the idea with producer David Wheeler and it was approved by the editor of Panorama, Michael Peacock. A silent film was recorded in Castagnola in Switzerland in March and a commentary written by Wheeler was added by respected broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. ==Personal life== De Jaeger left the BBC in 1959 to become a freelancer. He died in London in May 2000. ==References== ==External links== * Museum of Hoaxes article on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest hoax * * Obituary, The Independent, 29 May 2000 Category:1911 births Category:2000 deaths ",
