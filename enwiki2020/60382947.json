With The Beck House was constructed at 1101 Fort Street, lot 12 of block 75 of Boise's original townsite, near the site of the Cathedral of the Rockies, completed in 1960. In 1989 the First United Methodist Church, owners of the cathedral, purchased the Beck House and other historic properties in block 75 and planned to build a large parking lot. Three historic homes were demolished, but a neighborhood preservation effort managed to save some of the other properties. Eventually the Beck House was moved to the corner of 12th and Hays Streets. Since 2011 block 75 has been managed by Boise Downtown Teaching Farm. Albert Beck was a sheep rancher in Boise, and he and partner Obe Corder owned a mining interest at the site of the Sunbeam Mine. ==See also== * Fort Street Historic District ==References== ==External links== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boise, Idaho Category:Queen Anne architecture in Idaho Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1904 ",
