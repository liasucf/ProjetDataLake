    "text": "Ros\u00e2ngela Renn\u00f3 Gomes (Belo Horizonte, MG, 1962) is a Brazilian artist who lives and works in Rio de Janeiro. Her work consists of photographic images from public and private archives that question the nature of an image and its symbolic value. With the use of photographs, installations and objects, she appropriates and sheds new light on an anonymous body of photographs and negatives found mostly in flea markets, family albums, newspapers and archives. Renn\u00f3's interest in discarded images and habit of collecting were decisive in establishing her work strategies. Renn\u00f3 aims to generate interest in what she calls \u201cthe little stories of the downtrodden and the vanquished\u201d (Renn\u00f3, 2004). These stories include the \u201cinglorious\u201d episodes of history, the shameful events of the past that successive Brazilian political regimes would like to gloss over, which she says can be found or uncovered in the \u201clowest categories of the image\u201d: vernacular photography, identification shots, portraits. Renn\u00f3 does not take photographs herself instead she recycles existing photographs of this kind.Renn\u00f3\u2019s decision to recycle photographs is influenced by the ideas of Czech photo-theorist Vil\u00e9m Flusser who lived for many years in Brazil as well as the German photographer and theorist, Andreas Muller Pohle. In particular, Muller Pohl\u2019s idea of \u2018an ecology of images\u2019 informs Renno\u2019s practice of conserving and recycling images that already exist. == Life and career == === Education === Renn\u00f3 graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in 1986, and in Fine Arts by the Guignard School, in 1987. She obtained her doctorate degree in 1997 from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's School of Communication and Arts. Her thesis was an artist book based on her 1996 series, Scar (Cicatriz) of reproductions of photographic negatives from the archives of the S\u00e3o Paulo Penitentiary Museum. === Artistic career === Ros\u00e2ngela Renn\u00f3 began her artistic career in 1980. Her first group show was in 1985 at the IAB Gallery in Belo Horizonte, MG and her first solo exhibition, Anti-Cinema, was four years later, in 1989, at the Corpo Gallery also in Belo Horizonte. She soon obtained national and international recognition. By the end of the 1980s, her work reflected the feminine and domestic universes, making use of family photos, reconstructing and remixing the artists' own memories. When she began her graduate studies in 1988, she developed a photographic series based on discarded strips of negatives found near film editing studios on the University of S\u00e3o Paulo campus. In 1989, Renn\u00f3 moved from S\u00e3o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and shifted her focus from the private/domestic sphere to the public sphere. She started working with negatives and forgotten photo identification images acquired from popular studios. In the early 1990s, she started collecting and working with written descriptions of photographs instead of the actual images. Around this time Renn\u00f3 also started using photographs found in public and private archives. Renn\u00f3 participated in multiple group and individual exhibitions, including two editions of the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial in 1994 and 2010, two editions of the Mercosul Biennial (1997 and 2004), the Venice Biennale (1993), and the Havana Biennial in 1997. She received grants and fellowships from various cultural institutions, including the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica, in 1991; the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Artes, in 1992; Civitella Ranieri Foundation, in 1997; Vitae Foundation, in 1998, and the Guggenheim, in 1999. ==== Curatorship ==== Renn\u00f3 joined the curatorial team of the Museum of Art of S\u00e3o Paulo in 2014, organizing an exhibition about the Foto Cine Clube Bandeirante in 2016. As of that year, her contract has not been renewed. == Selected works == === Universal Archive === Universal Archive (Arquivo Universal) (1992-) is a work in progress made up of written descriptions of photographs from newspaper articles. The artists characterizes the work as \"images without images\", and has used it as the basis of multiple series. === 2005-510117385-5 and A01 [cod. 19.1.1.43] - A27 [s|cod.23] === 2005\u2013510117385\u20135 and A01 [cod.19.1.1.43] \u2014 A27 [s|cod.23] are the first and second iterations in a series of artist books about the theft of historic photography collections from Brazilian public archives. The title of 2005\u2013510117385\u20135 (published in 2010) comes from the criminal inquiry number corresponding to the 2005 theft of 946 works, including 751 photographs, from the Alo\u00edsio Magalh\u00e3es Room of the Brazilian National Library. The book is composed of life-size reproductions of the verso of the 101 photographs that were recovered. A01 [cod.19.1.1.43] \u2014 A27 [s|cod.23], published in 2013, documents the empty interiors of the archival photo storage boxes after the theft of more than half of the photographic albums by Augusto Malta at the Archives of the City of Rio de Janeiro. The title is a reference to the classification of the albums in the archive. == Collections == === In Brazil === * Joaquim Nabuco Foundation, Recife, Brasil * Museum of Modern Art Aloisio Magalh\u00e3es (MAMAM), Recife, Brasil * Museum of Art of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brasil * Museum of Art of Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, Brasil * Inhotim Institute, Inhotim, Brasil * Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro (MAM RJ), Gilberto Chateuabriand Collection, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil * Museum of Modern Art of S\u00e3o Paulo (MAM SP), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil * Pinacoteca do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil * Museum of Art of S\u00e3o Paulo (MASP), Pirelli Collection, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil === International === * Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France * Tate Modern, London, England * Culturgest, Lisbon, Portugal * Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Caloustre Gulbenkian, Lisboa, Portugal * Centro Galego de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo (CGAC), Santiago de Compostela, Spain * Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain * Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (MUSAC) Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Espanha * Museo de C\u00e1ceres, C\u00e1ceres, Spain * Museo Extreme\u00f1o e Iberoamericano de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo (MEIAC), Badajoz, Spain * Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (SMAK), Gent, Belgium * Fondazioni Cassa de Risparmo de Modena, Italy * Daros Latinamerica, Zurich, Switzerland * Museum of Moderna Art (MOMA), New York, USA * Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, USA * Latino Museum, Los Angeles, USA * Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles, USA * Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, USA * Guggenheim Museum, New York, USA *Western Sydney University, Australia == References == ==External links == * Artist website Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian contemporary artists Category:Brazilian photographers Category:Brazilian women artists Category:People from Belo Horizonte Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo alumni Category:Women photographers ",
