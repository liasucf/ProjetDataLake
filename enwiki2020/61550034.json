She was launched on 28 February 1939 and completed 1 April 1939. On 12 September 1941, she was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted to an auxiliary minesweeper under Reserve Lieutenant Funaki Takashi (\u8239\u6728\u9686). Funaki served until 19 May 1943 when he was replaced by Reserve Lieutenant Yoshino Teruhiko (\u5409\u91ce\u8f1d\u5f66). On 20 May 1944, she was reclassified as a submarine chaser. In October 1944, Yoshino was replaced by Lieutenant Shinoo Matao (\u65b0\u91ce\u5c3e\u53c8\u96c4). She was sunk on 8 April 1945 by the submarine east of the island of Shokokusanto (Korean: Heuksando) to the southwest of mainland Korea (). She was struck from the Navy list on 3 May 1947. ==References== Category:1939 ships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:Maritime incidents in April 1945 Category:Ships sunk by American submarines Category:World War II minesweepers of Japan Category:Mine warfare vessels of the Imperial Japanese Navy Category:Auxiliary ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy ",
