She can play both defender and midfielder and she was a member of Sweden women's national football team. At Link\u00f6pings Karlsson was known as Maria \"Mia\" Karlsson, due to the presence of younger team-mate and namesake Maria \"Kalle\" Karlsson. Both left the club after the 2010 Damallsvenskan season. The elder Karlsson was particularly well thought of by Link\u00f6pings as she had joined in 2000, when the club played outside the top division and were known as Kenty DFF. She subsequently played for local club BK Tinnis when her police training allowed. In 2013, she was dual\u2013signed to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 FF. Karlsson made her senior Sweden debut on 26 June 2004; a 2\u20131 Euro 2005 qualifying defeat to Italy in Benevento. She was included in the squad for the final tournament. ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Swedish women's footballers Category:Sweden women's international footballers Category:Living people Category:Damallsvenskan players Category:Link\u00f6pings FC players Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Association football defenders Category:V\u00e4xj\u00f6 DFF players ",
