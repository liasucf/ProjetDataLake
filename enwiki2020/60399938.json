As Special Advisor for Academic Planning and Operational Continuity for the California State University system, Vollendorf provides strategic support related to crisis management and longer-term continuity planning for the nation's largest four-year public education system. She has extensive experience managing crises on college campuses, including numerous wildfires, smoke outs, incidents of campus violence, power shutoffs, and COVID-19. She is deeply committed to creative, collaborative problem solving and to leveraging the incredible human capital we have at our universities to make the world a better place for all. From 2017-2020, she served as Provost and Executive Vice President of Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California. At Sonoma State, Vollendorf led campus strategic planning and implementation while working collaboratively with all stakeholders and campus leadership to create a strategic approach to budgeting under Building Our Future @ SSU: Strategic Plan 2025. During this time, Sonoma State pivoted to serve the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area more purposefully by opening its doors wider to transfer students. This shift was part of an overall strategy to help a region ravaged by the 2017 wildfires recover and thrive. Previously, Vollendorf was Dean of Humanities and the Arts at San Jos\u00e9 State University (2012-2017), where she led efforts in collaboration with the city of San Jos\u00e9 to bring the Hammer Theatre to life. Prior to SJSU, she was department chair, senate chair, and professor of Spanish at California State University, Long Beach (2005\u201312). She began her teaching career at Miami University of Ohio (1995\u201397) and earned tenure at Wayne State University in Detroit (1997-2005). She received a Ph.D. in Romance Languages from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995, an MA in Spanish and Latin American Literatures from University of Pennsylvania in 1992, and a BA in English and Spanish from Colorado State University in 1990. Vollendorf is a well-established scholar of sixteenth and seventeenth century women\u2019s cultural history in Iberia and Latin America. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Mellon Foundation, the Newberry Library, the Huntington Library, and the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library.
