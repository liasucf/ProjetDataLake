For example, \"It is snowing in Nebraska\" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence don't necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.Birner, Betty J. Introduction to Pragmatics. 2013. Wiley-Blackwell. More formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an inductive definition of truth (for details, see the semantic theory of truth). Understood this way, truth conditions are theoretical entities. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theoryField, H. (1972). Tarski's Theory of Truth. The Journal of Philosophy, 69(13), 347-375. doi:10.2307/2024879 which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word \"Nixon\" refers to Richard M. Nixon, and \"is alive\" is associated with the set of currently living things. Then one way of representing the truth condition of \"Nixon is alive\" is as the ordered pair . And we say that \"Nixon is alive\" is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) \"Nixon\" belongs to the set associated with \"is alive\", that is, if and only if Nixon is alive. In semantics, the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its meaning. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is uncertain. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are necessarily true \u2014 that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical \u2014 they have precisely the same members \u2014 but presumably the sentences \"Nixon is alive\" and \"Nixon is alive and is not a rock\" have different meanings. ==See also== * Slingshot argument ==Notes and references== * Iten, C.
