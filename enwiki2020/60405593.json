The game was inspired by the online platform Club Penguin, where players can choose cartoon mole-avatars, decorate their virtual homes, adopt pets, and socialize with other players. They can wander through the virtual streets, chat with other users, go shopping, work, and play mini-games. Mole Manor occasionally offers promotional games that are available for a limited period. The official version was tested in March, 2008 and was made available to the public on 28 April 2008, with regular, scheduled maintenance every Friday, except holidays. The mainland version was terminated in March 2015. However, the launch of an official Weibo version of the game was announced on 18 January 2019. Mole Manor is driven by Adobe Flash Player, and offers paid services. == Plot == Moles and Ramus live in the Black Forest. Moles are friendly, diligent and are excellent architects. Ramus, the goblins of banyan trees, are good friends of the moles and they live happily together in the forest. The king of the moles led his followers to create Mole Manor in the middle of the Black Forest. The manor is similar to those that existed in Medieval Europe. At that time, the Black forest was beautiful and was as the center of cultural communications. During the reign of King Mole III, the Black Forest was burnt down. The underground homes of moles destroyed and the banyan trees where the Ramus lived in were destroyed. The manor was then reconstructed in the southern region of the Black Forest. The ruler of the kingdom is Princess Meme, who is the last heir of the royal family and lives in Mole Castle, protecting the Manor with her knights. Gradually, shopping malls, schools, news agencies, banks, and entertainment parks are developed by the hard-working moles. == Gameplay == Mole Manor has multiple functions, including a virtual community, dress and fashion, interactive games, pet raising and virtual home decoration. Players will be in Role-playing as moles. The color of mole can be tailored. Players have a patch of garden where they can farm and a house that is ready to be decorated. Players can socialize with other players on the virtual streets or in their virtual homes. They can either chat, pay a visit, provide help or send gifts to friends. Moles can also attend school. There are also mini-games like water fights, hide-and-seek, theatre playing and idiom guessing. They can also have Ramus, a kind of plant goblin, as pets. Players must feed, clean and take care of the Ramus, and sometimes send them to school. Ramus that are not cared for may die from neglect. Players can pay a small fee to upgrade their Ramus into Super Ramus, so they will be entitled to a wide range of privileges in the game. Moles can have career options such as tour guide, policeman, or journalist. Players can accomplish daily assignments. After finishing an assignment, a player will receive rewards, including experience points and the virtual currency \"MoDo\" (Mole Dollar). MoDo can be used for purchasing clothes, home decorations and Ramus' food. The resources you own depends on the amount of effort you have put into the game. Deals between players are forbidden. Special holidays, theme parties, and featured adventures are available periodically. The background music is typically works composed by Beethoven, but holiday songs also appear during the holidays. Unlike most online games, Mole Manor does not require users to complete a profile during registration, avoiding potential privacy issues. Players must provide their birthday and email address. The game uses an information filter that forbids players to input numbers in case of an information leak. According to a paper from Shih Hsin University, however, players can divide a sentence into segments to avoid censorship. Players can report others using vulgar language, probing for personal information, or using third-party software. As soon as the report is received, the reported account will be banned from playing again. There are measures to prevent children obsessively playing online games; the website automatically closes at midnight and reopens at 06:00. == Development == Taomee believed that there was a huge market for children's online games. Wang Haibing, former executive of QQ pet project at Tencent, started Taomee and gained investment from Zeng Liqing, the co-founder of Tencent and Wang Bing, and deputy president of Sina.\u6e20\u9053\u5546\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6469\u5c14\u5e84\u56ed\u70b9\u5361\u6708\u9500\u552e\u6536\u5165\u8fd1\u5343\u4e07\u5143 \u300a\u521b\u4e1a\u90a6\u300b\uff0c2009\u5e748\u670820\u65e5\u520a\u8f7d\uff0c2014\u5e747\u670829\u65e5\u9605\u89c8 Before Mole Manor was developed, Taomee aimed to create a children's educational online community named \"fruit kids\", whose target audience was children between 3 and 8. At that time, however, pre-school children were not extensively exposed to the Internet and the company was more familiar with the Internet than with educational products, and \"fruit kids\" was abandoned. Wang Haibing noticed the success of American online game Club Penguin and decided to use a similar pattern, and adjusted the target audience to children aged over 8. Zheng Zhouli, one of the earliest designers of Mole Manor, said the game was targeted at primary school students who had heavy academic burdens and needed a relaxing game. When the game was released, the target audience was children aged between 8 and 14. During its trial stage, the target-player age-range was adjusted to 7 to 12,\u592e\u89c6\u6279\u6469\u5c14\u5e84\u56ed\u5c0f\u73a9\u5bb6\u7206\u5427\u6297\u8bae(\u7ec4\u56fe) \u520a\u767b\u4e8e\u4e91\u5357\u4fe1\u606f\u62a5\uff0c\u7f51\u6613\u8f6c\u8f7d 2009-9-2[2014-7-31] and finally it became 7 to 14. Taomee often improved its product using users' feedback. For example, there was no bank in the game before some players said they had earned too much MoDo and had no idea how to spend them. After a bank was introduced to the game, many young players asked their parents, \"why I saved money in the bank and the amount begin to increase? Aren't the banks going to be become bankrupt for giving back too much money?\" The developer also taught young players about basic financial knowledge. == Operations == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- | style=\"width:10%\" |Regions | style=\"width:10%\" |Developer/ Agent |Translation | style=\"width:12%\" |Start date | style=\"width:12%\" |Terminate date | style=\"width:10%\" |Domestic ranking | style=\"width:10%\" |Global ranking | style=\"width:12%\" |Official website |- |Mainland China |Shanghai TaoMee | |2008.04.28 | |18,48251mole.com Site Info |102,096 |mole.61.com |- |Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan |Taiwan TaoMee | |2008.12.24 |2015.01.01 |3,87751mole.com.tw Site Info |234,970 |mole.61.com.tw |- |Vietnam\u6dd8\u7c73\uff1a\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u79c0\u51fa\u4e2d\u56fd\u201c\u529f\u592b\u6d3e\u201d \u51e4\u51f0\u7f51 \u201c\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u6dd8\u7c73\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5df2\u51fa\u53e3\u5230\u8d8a\u5357\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u97e9\u56fd\u3001\u6cf0\u56fd\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u5730\u533a\u3002\u201d |VNG |V\u01b0\u01a1ng Qu\u1ed1c Chu\u1ed9t Ch\u0169i |2011.10 |2012.12.28 |9zing.vn Site Info |748 |moly.zing.vn |- |Japan |So-net |\u3082\u3050\u3082\u3050\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 |2012.06 |2013.09.30 | |1,836,996 (final data)mole55.jp Site Info |www.mole55.jp |- |Thailand |SNS+ |MOLOO |2012.06 |2013.04 | |2,387,275 (final data)moloo.in.th Site Info |www.moloo.in.th |- |South Korea |Joyian |\ub370\uad74\ub370\uad74 \ub450\ub450\uc6d4\ub4dc |2012.07 |2013.03.28 | |2,242,917 (final data)joyian.com Site Info |dd.joyian.com |- |Europe |Pending | | | | | | |- |United States |Pending | | | | | | |} December, 2009, figures of users of different children virtual community websites. === Mainland China === Mole Manor is the first children's online game in mainland China, and occupied the biggest market share.
