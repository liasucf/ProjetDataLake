However, he began his major league career with the Seattle Mariners in 1987. After a year in Seattle, Monteleone pitched relief for the California Angels from 1988 to 1989, the New York Yankees from 1990 to 1993, the San Francisco Giants in 1994, and the Angels again from 1995 to 1996. In 1995, he started the season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) with the Chunichi Dragons before returning to the Angels. After his last season as a player in 1996, Monteleone signed up as a coach for the Yankees, where he has remained ever since. While he was most recently with the big league team, Monteleone has also coached Yankees' minor league teams during his tenure. From 2002 to 2008, Monteleone served as the bullpen coach for the Yankees. He was fired by the team after the disastrous 2008 season. Monteleone holds the Major League career record for most pitching appearances without a start or a save with 210. ==Personal life== Monteleone and his wife Loretta have two daughters, Chelsea Rhae and Alexis Blake. ==References== ==External links== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Baseball coaches from Florida Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Bristol Tigers players Category:Calgary Cannons players Category:California Angels players Category:Chunichi Dragons players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Lakeland Tigers players Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:New York Yankees coaches Category:New York Yankees players Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Vancouver Canadians players ",
