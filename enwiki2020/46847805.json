The first team to win four games in the series is declared NBL Canada champion. It has been played since the league's inaugural 2011\u201312 season. The London Lightning and Windsor Express are currently the only teams that have claimed the title, with the latter one winning the last two editions of the Finals. Only two coaches have won the championship so far.

In the first two series in NBL history, head coach Micheal Ray Richardson led the London Lightning to back-to-back championships. Richardson was named Coach of the Year for both seasons. Bill Jones led Windsor to consecutive titles as well. ==Finals MVP== The player with the top performances in the NBL Finals is named Finals Most Valuable Player.
