    "text": "Methyl blue is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C37H27N3Na2O9S3. It is used as a stain in histology, and stains collagen blue in tissue sections. It can be used in some differential staining techniques such as Mallory's connective tissue stain and G\u00f6m\u00f6ri trichrome stain, and can be used to mediate electron transfer in microbial fuel cells. Fungal cell walls are also stained by methyl blue. Methyl blue is also available in mixture with water blue, under name Aniline Blue WS, Aniline blue, China blue, or Soluble blue; and in a solution of phenol, glycerol, and lactic acid under the name Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB), which is used for microscopic visualization of fungi. == Chemistry == Methyl blue ( 4-[Bis[4-[(sulfophenyl)amino]phenyl]methylene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]amino]-benzenesulfonic acid disodium salt) is distinctly different to methylene blue ([7-(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-3-ylidene]-dimethylazanium;chloride) in structure, function and uses, and must not be confused https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/substance/methylblue799802898356411?lang=en&region;=AU Its uses include staining histology samples for collagen https://www.abcam.com/methyl-blue-sodium-salt-histology-stain-for-collagen- ab146271.html, and for fungal structures https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma- Aldrich/Datasheet/1/61335dat.pdf. ==See also== * Potassium ferrocyanide * Potassium ferricyanide * Methylene blue * Egyptian blue * Han Purple * Crystal violet * Fluorescein ==References== Category:Triarylmethane dyes Category:Staining dyes Category:Aromatic amines ",
