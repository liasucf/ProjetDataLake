He was a prominent member of the group at Anding to restore the Jin Dynasty authority in the north following the Disaster of Yongjia in 311, and in the regime's final years, he was Emperor Min's most influential advisor along with Qu Yun. As Emperor Min's rule came to a close in 316 as Han Zhao forces besieged the capital Chang'an, Suo Lin took advantage of the emperor's surrender to ensure a high position in Han's government by secretly sending his son to negotiate. However, Han's commander, Liu Yao denied his proposal and beheaded his son. After the emperor surrendered, Suo Lin was executed in Pingyang for his disloyalty. == Early life and career == Suo Lin was from Dunhuang in Gansu province and his father Suo Jing, was an official of Jin and talented calligrapher who often praised him for his talents.(\u7d9d\u5b57\u5de8\u79c0\uff0c\u5c11\u6709\u9038\u7fa4\u4e4b\u91cf\uff0c\u9756\u6bcf\u66f0\uff1b\u300c\u7d9d\u5eca\u5edf\u4e4b\u624d\uff0c\u975e\u7c21\u5284\u4e4b\u7528\uff0c\u5dde\u90e1\u540f\u4e0d\u8db3\u6c57\u543e\u5152\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Book of Jin, Volume 60 Suo Lin saw his first role in the government as an Abundant Talent candidate and Household Gentlemen. One time, it was said that Suo personally killed 37 men to avenge his own brother. This feat earned him the reverence of the populace, and he soon found himself appointed to a succession of posts, all of which he served with distinction.(\u8209\u79c0\u624d\uff0c\u9664\u90ce\u4e2d\u3002\u5617\u5831\u5144\u4ec7\uff0c\u624b\u6bba\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u4eba\uff0c\u6642\u4eba\u58ef\u4e4b\u3002\u4fc4\u8f49\u592a\u5bb0\u53c3\u8ecd\uff0c\u9664\u597d\u7564\u4ee4\uff0c\u4eba\u70ba\u9ec3\u9580\u4f8d\u90ce\uff0c\u51fa\u53c3\u5f81\u897f\u8ecd\u4e8b\uff0c\u8f49\u9577\u5b89\u4ee4\uff0c\u5728\u5b98\u6709\u7a31\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 60 In 304, during the War of the Eight Princes, the Prince of Hejian, Sima Yong ordered Suo Lin and Zhang Fang to retrieve the emperor at Luoyang to move him to his base in Chang'an. After successfully doing so, Suo Lin was appointed General of Hawkish Display. After the Prince of Donghai, Sima Yue, was victorious over Sima Ying and Sima Yong in 306, Suo Lin was transferred to serve the Prince of Nanyang, Sima Mo (\u53f8\u99ac\u6a21) in Xuchang.(\u53ca\u6210\u90fd\u738b\u7a4e\u52ab\u9077\u60e0\u5e1d\u5e78\u9134\uff0c\u7a4e\u70ba\u738b\u6d5a\u6240\u7834\uff0c\u5e1d\u9042\u64ad\u8d8a\u3002\u6cb3\u9593\u738b\u9852\u4f7f\u5f35\u65b9\u53ca\u7d9d\u6771\u8fce\u4e58\u8f3f\uff0c\u4ee5\u529f\u62dc\u9df9\u694a\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u8f49\u5357\u967d\u738b\u6a21\u5f9e\u4e8b\u4e2d\u90ce\u3002) Book of JIn, Volume 60 In 306, Sima Mo's territory was invaded by the Han Zhao prince, Liu Cong. Sima Mo sent Suo Lin to resist Cong and Suo Lin defeated him. When Sima Mo was transferred to Chang'an in 307, Suo Lin followed him and became Administrator of Xinping (\u65b0\u5e73\u53bf, in present-day Henan). That same year, Liu Cong attacked Sima Mo again. Suo Lin was appointed General Who Maintains The West and Administrator of Pingyi and he asserted power over his territory.(\u5289\u8070\u4fb5\u63a0\u95dc\u6771\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d9d\u70ba\u596e\u5a01\u5c07\u8ecd\u4ee5\u79a6\u4e4b\uff0c\u65ac\u8070\u5c07\u5442\u9038\uff0c\u53c8\u7834\u8070\u515a\u5289\u8c50\uff0c\u9077\u65b0\u5e73\u592a\u5b88\u3002\u8070\u5c07\u8607\u9435\u3001\u5289\u4e94\u6597\u7b49\u52ab\u63a0\u4e09\u8f14\uff0c\u9664\u7d9d\u5b89\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\u3001\u99ae\u7fca\u592a\u5b88\u3002\u7d9d\u6709\u5a01\u6069\uff0c\u83ef\u5937\u5411\u670d\uff0c\u8cca\u4e0d\u6562\u72af\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 60 == Restoring the Jin Dynasty == Eventually, in 311, Jin's capital Luoyang fell to Han and Emperor Huai of Jin was captured by Liu Cong, who had succeeded his father as emperor. Shortly after, Chang'an was captured by Han as Sima Mo was defeated by his former subordinate Zhao Ran and sent to Liu Can for execution. With the emperor and Chang'an lost and his lord dead, Suo Lin fled to Anding together with his colleagues Qu Yun and Liang Su (\u6881\u8085) to join its administrator, Jia Ya. Along the way, Suo Lin and the others encountered the sons of Jia Ya's officials and those from the Qiang and Di tribes in Anding sent to Han to serve as hostages.

Jia Ya agreed and the conspirators acclaimed Jia Ya as General Who Pacifies the West. Jia Ya marched on to capture Chang'an. The Inspector of Yongzhou, Qu Te (\u9eb4\u7279), the Administrator of Fufeng, Liang Zong (\u6881\u7d9c) and of Xinping, Zhu Hui (\u7afa\u6062) switched allegiance from Han when they heard that Jin forces were coming. Liu Can sent his generals Zhao Ran and Liu Ya (\u5289\u96c5) to attack Xinping but Suo Lin managed to defeat them. After Jia Ya defeated Liu Yao at Huangqiu (\u9ec3\u4e18, in present-day Tai'erzhuang District, Shandong) and Liu Can was driven away from Xinfeng (\u65b0\u8c50\u53bf, in Jingzhao, modern-day Shaanxi), many of the people returned to Jin and Chang'an was reclaimed. Hearing that Chang'an was in the process of liberation, Yan Ding of Tianshui commandery brought Emperor Huai's nephew, Sima Ye to Chang'an and Ye was declared the Crown Prince.(\u9f0e\u5c11\u6709\u5927\u5fd7\uff0c\u56e0\u897f\u571f\u4eba\u601d\u6b78\uff0c\u6b32\u7acb\u529f\u9109\u91cc\uff0c\u4e43\u8207\u64ab\u8ecd\u9577\u53f2\u738b\u6bd7\u3001\u53f8\u99ac\u50b3\u905c\u61f7\u7ffc\u6234\u79e6\u738b\u4e4b\u8a08\uff0c\u8b02\u7587\u3001\u6377\u7b49\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5c71\u6771\u975e\u9738\u738b\u8655\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u95dc\u4e2d\u3002\u300d\u6cb3\u967d\u4ee4\u5085\u66a2\u907a\u9f0e\u66f8\uff0c\u52f8\u5949\u79e6\u738b\u904e\u6d1b\u967d\uff0c\u8b01\u62dc\u5c71\u9675\uff0c\u5f91\u64da\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u7d8f\u5408\u5937\u6649\uff0c\u8208\u8d77\u7fa9\u773e\uff0c\u514b\u5fa9\u5b97\u5edf\uff0c\u96ea\u793e\u7a37\u4e4b\u6065\u3002\u9f0e\u5f97\u66f8\uff0c\u4fbf\u6b32\u8a63\u6d1b\uff0c\u6d41\u4eba\u8b02\u5317\u9053\u8fd1\u6cb3\uff0c\u61fc\u6709\u6284\u622a\uff0c\u6b32\u5357\u81ea\u6b66\u95dc\u5411\u9577\u5b89\u3002\u7587\u7b49\u7686\u5c71\u6771\u4eba\uff0c\u54b8\u4e0d\u9858\u897f\u5165\uff0c\u8340\u7c53\u53ca\u7587\u3001\u6377\u7b49\u4e26\u9003\u6563\u3002\u9f0e\u8ffd\u7c53\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\ue4be\u6046\u7b49\u898b\u6bba\uff0c\u552f\u9857\u3001\u8ff0\u8d70\u5f97\u514d\u3002\u9042\u5949\u79e6\u738b\u884c\uff0c\u6b62\u4e0a\u6d1b\uff0c\u70ba\u5c71\u8cca\u6240\u8972\uff0c\u6bba\u767e\u9918\u4eba\uff0c\u7387\u9918\u773e\u897f\u81f3\u85cd\u7530\u3002\u6642\u5289\u8070\u5411\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u70ba\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u8cc8\u758b\u6240\u9010\uff0c\u8d70\u9084\u5e73\u967d\u3002\u758b\u9063\u4eba\u5949\u8fce\u79e6\u738b\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 60 Despite the group's initial success, they soon suffered a major setback the following year.

He was granted authority over the Masters of Writing, allowing him to be in control of most of the government's affairs.(\u5289\u66dc\u5165\u95dc\u829f\u9ea5\u82d7\uff0c\u7d9d\u53c8\u64ca\u7834\u4e4b\u3002\u81ea\u9577\u5b89\u4f10\u5289\u8070\uff0c\u8070\u5c07\u8d99\u67d3\u6756\u5176\u7d2f\u6377\uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u77dc\u4e4b\u8272\uff0c\u5e25\u7cbe\u9a0e\u6578\u767e\u8207\u7d9d\u6230\uff0c\u5927\u6557\u4e4b\uff0c\u67d3\u55ae\u99ac\u800c\u8d70\u3002\u8f49\u9a43\u9a0e\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u3001\u5c1a\u66f8\u5de6\u50d5\u5c04\u3001\u9304\u5c1a\u66f8\uff0c\u627f\u5236\u884c\u4e8b\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 60 The next year, Suo Lin received the position of Supervisor of the Masters of Writing and as Commander of military affairs in and around Chang'an itself.(\u6f22\u5927\u53f8\u99ac\u66dc\u5bc7\u5317\u5730\uff0c\u8a54\u4ee5\u9eb4\u5141\u7232\u5927\u90fd\u7763\u3001\u9a43\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd\u4ee5\u79a6\u4e4b\u3002\u51ac\uff0c\u5341\u6708\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d22\u7d9d\u7232\u5c1a\u66f8\u50d5\u5c04\u3001\u90fd\u7763\u5bae\u57ce\u8af8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 Around the same time, Liu Yao was invading Beidi (\u5317\u5730\u90e1, in present-day Qingyang, Gansu) and Qu Yun struggled to oppose him. Even worse, Chang'an and the region was suffering from a terrible famine at the time. Qu Yun wishes to bring Emperor Min over to Sima Bao in Qinzhou who had a stronger army and base to oppose Han. Suo Lin rejected this proposal, stating that Sima Bao would surely use the emperor for himself if they were to do that, so Qu no longer asked.(\u9eb9\u5141\u6b32\u633e\u5929\u5b50\u8da3\u4fdd\uff0c\u7d9d\u4ee5\u4fdd\u5fc5\u901e\u79c1\u6b32\uff0c\u4e43\u6b62\u3002\u81ea\u9577\u5b89\u4ee5\u897f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fa9\u5949\u671d\u5ef7\u3002\u767e\u5b98\u9951\u4e4f\uff0c\u91c7\u7a6d\u81ea\u5b58\u3002) Book of Jin, Volume 60 == Downfall and death == Finally, in 316, Liu Yao would besiege Chang'an for the last time.

Sima Bao sent Hu Song (\u80e1\u5d27) to reinforce Chang'an but even though Hu had defeated Liu Yao on the way, he decided to turn back as he fear that if Emperor Min were to triumph over Han, Qu Yun and Suo Lin were surely to greatly influence power in the government.(\u7126\u5d69\u3001\u7afa\u6062\u3001\u5b8b\u54f2\u7686\u5f15\u5175\u6551\u9577\u5b89\uff0c\u6563\u9a0e\u5e38\u4f8d\u83ef\u8f2f\u76e3\u4eac\u5146\u3001\u99ae\u7fca\u3001\u5f18\u8fb2\u3001\u4e0a\u6d1b\u56db\u90e1\u5175\uff0c\u5c6f\u9738\u4e0a\uff0c\u7686\u754f\u6f22\u5175\u5f37\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u9032\u3002\u76f8\u570b\u4fdd\u9063\u80e1\u5d27\u5c07\u5175\u5165\u63f4\uff0c\u64ca\u6f22\u5927\u53f8\u99ac\u66dc\u65bc\u9748\u81fa\uff0c\u7834\u4e4b\u3002\u5d27\u6050\u570b\u5a01\u5fa9\u632f\u5247\u9eb4\u3001\u7d22\u52e2\u76db\uff0c\u4e43\u5e25\u57ce\u897f\u8af8\u90e1\u5175\u5c6f\u6e2d\u5317\u4e0d\u9032\uff0c\u9042\u9084\u69d0\u91cc\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 Chang'an had not recovered from their famine and with the siege going on, they were cut off from supplies outside the city.
