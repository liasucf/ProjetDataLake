    "text": "This is a list of bridges and other crossings of the Pasig River in Metro Manila, Philippines. The crossings are listed in order starting from its mouth at Manila Bay and proceeding upstream to its source at Laguna de Bay. As of 2015, there are a total of nineteen bridge spans in Metro Manila that cross the Pasig River, including three rail bridges, carrying the LRT Line 1, MRT Line 3 and the Philippine National Railways track. A bridge connecting Santa Monica Street in Kapitolyo, Pasig to Lawton Avenue, Taguig is being planned by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) as part of the Bonifacio Global City\u2013Ortigas Link Bridge. The planned Metro Manila Subway will also cross the Pasig River between Pasig and Makati, making it the first tunnel to cross the river. ==Crossings== {| class=wikitable ! # ! Crossing ! Carries !
