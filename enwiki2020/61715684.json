    "text": "Nathaniel Paul (d. 1839) was a minister and abolitionist who worked in Albany, New York, Wilberforce Colony in Canada, and traveled to Britain to raise support to aid African Americans. He went to Britain to gain support and stayed there from 1832 until 1835. He was a brother of Thomas Paul. In 1827 he gave a speech celebrating the abolition of slavery in New York. His comments included the statement: \"The lordly planter who has his thousands in bondage, may stretch himself upon his couch of ivory, and sneer at the exertions which are made by the humane and benevolent, or he may take his stand upon the floor of Congress, and mock the pitiful generosity of the east or west for daring to meddle with the subject, and attempting to expose its injustice: he may threaten to resist all efforts for a general or a partial emancipation even to a dissolution of the union. But still I declare that slavery will be extinct; a universal and not a partial emancipation must take place; nor is the period far distant.\" On January 14, 1832, the abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, published a letter from Paul about his trip to England. Paul was involved in fundraising efforts for Wilberforce Colony in Canada, a settlement that included African Americans fleeing violent attacks in Cincinnati, Ohio. The colony was named after British abolitionist statesman William Wilberforce. ==References== Category:1770s births Category:1839 deaths Category:Religious leaders from Albany, New York Category:African-American abolitionists ",
