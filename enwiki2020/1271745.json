    "text": "Playa Ancha University of Educational Sciences (), mostly known as Playa Ancha University or UPLA, is a public university in Valpara\u00edso, Chile. It is part of the Chilean Traditional Universities, belonging to the Council of Rectors, a select group of twenty-five chilean universities. The university has two campuses: the major one in Playa Ancha, Valpara\u00edso, and the second one in San Felipe. The university seeks to train professionals with an ethical, humanistic, analytical, critical and creative profile, who can contribute to economic, cultural, social, regional and national development. The institution has a vast tradition in education and humanities areas, and it is deeply involved with the community of Valparaiso and San Felipe. ==History== The university was founded in 1948 as the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile with the intention to enhance the study of languages. === The Creation of the Pedagogical Institute (1948-1973) === Insignia of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile The Pedagogical Institute of Valpara\u00edso was founded in 1948, as the initiative of Oscar Guzm\u00e1n Escobar, a lawyer and professor at the then Valpara\u00edso Law School of the University of Chile, with the intention of promoting the study of Spanish and some foreign languages. It was initially located on Calle Col\u00f3n in Valpara\u00edso, in the former campus of the current School of Law of the University of Valpara\u00edso, currently the School of Social Work of the same University. It was supported in its initiative by the professors of Valpara\u00edso Emilio Mu\u00f1oz Mena, Juan Monted\u00f3nico Napoli and Pedro Contreras Valderrama, among others. In 1950, due to the quality of its activity, and after inspection by the members of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, it received by Supreme Decree the status of State cooperator in education, its exams being valid and rendered before the official commissions designated by the Casa de Bello. The first courses taught by the then Institute were Pedagogy in Spanish, French and English, while in 1951 a Philosophy course was created and a year later the first School of Journalism in the country and a Women's Normal School were established. The University of Chile initially contributed with very outstanding professors from Santiago, such as H\u00e9ctor Castillo, Ricardo Benavides, and Professor Cedomil Goic, among others, together with outstanding professors from the region such as Juan Monted\u00f3nico, Carlos Pantoja G\u00f3mez, and F\u00e9lix Morales Pettorino, who formed a team that took advantage, together with teachers from the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valpara\u00edso and with people who had begun their professional training in Pedagogy, emerging as assistant professors. Due to the request of its director and the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, Mr. Eugenio Pererira Salas, Decree No. 9,118 of October 13, 1954 was issued, on the basis of which the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile in Valpara\u00edso was created, which began to function as such the following year. This document was signed by the President of the Republic, Mr. Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo, and his Minister of Education, Mr. Tob\u00edas Barros Ortiz. === The Military Dictatorship (1973-1990) === Memorial to students and teachers who were victims of the military dictatorship On September 11, 1973, a coup d'\u00e9tat took place, to which, according to various accounts, the University did not offer resistance, being invaded by military assault around 12:15 by the \"Maipo\" 2nd Infantry Regiment, despite the fact that at that time there were already few students at the University (alerted by the situation in the country). The intervention led to massive arrests of students, academics and officials. In 1981 \u2014by decision of the military dictatorship\u2014 the Valpara\u00edso branch of the University of Chile was separated from its main campus (located in the city of Santiago de Chile), creating the University of Valpara\u00edso first. Two months later, in a second split, the Faculty of Education and Letters was transformed into the Instituto Profesional Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedag\u00f3gicas de Valpara\u00edso (Professional Institute of the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valpara\u00edso). This transition meant the significant loss of its infrastructure and the allocation of a reduced state contribution (0.6% of the total direct fiscal contribution), in addition to other problems arising from the policies and definitions implemented by the authoritarian regime that affected academics, officials and students. Law 18,434 of 4 September 1985, created the Playa Ancha University, which succeeded the Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedag\u00f3gicas de Valpara\u00edso and the University of Chile. === The UPLA nowadays (1990-present) === The return to democracy in 1990 brought with it the election of the first democratically elected rector by direct vote of academics, Professor Pedro Norman Cort\u00e9s Larrieu being elected on that occasion. In 1991, its San Felipe campus began operating. On the other hand, there was an important development of the infrastructure: the Faculty of Arts is built in 1995, the adjacent lands to the central house are acquired, the FEUPLA is put in operation with Confech vote and the kindergarten \"Colmenita\" is built, with the purpose of providing room to university parents or employees of the University. With the advent of the year 2000, the changes continue to take place. The new building of Natural and Exact Sciences is inaugurated, as well as the Faculty of Social Sciences, which offers degrees in Sociology (2002), Psychology (2013), Journalism and Library Science. The performing arts hall (for students of Theatre) is created, being one of the best equipped in the whole region and moving the casino to a new location next to the Faculty of Arts. In 2008 the new University library is inaugurated and with it the SIBUPLA makes its debut, giving shape to one of the most equipped, spacious and modern libraries in the region. Towards 2013, the Faculty of Health and Engineering is created, acquiring the Independencia campus. In 2012 two multipurpose domes were acquired, one located in the Patio de los Vientos, next to the Faculty of Arts, and the other in the San Felipe Campus. In 2014 the Nursing laboratories were created, in 2012 the Center for Advanced Studies (CEA) and the Vice- Rector's Office for Research, Innovation and Postgraduate Studies were installed in Vi\u00f1a del Mar. In October 2014, with 71.5% of the votes in a trystman plebiscite, the elimination of the Board of Directors and the creation of a University Senate, which represents the three estates, students, officials and academics, is approved. == Symbols == Punta Angeles Lighthouse, symbol of the Playa Ancha University === Emblem === The emblem of the Playa Ancha University is a lighthouse illuminating both sectors with a lone star leading the way (in reference to being at night). Its inspiration comes from the Punta \u00c1ngeles Lighthouse, created in 1837 under the presidency of Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Prieto. This is located next to the University, as a symbol of being one of the pioneer houses of study in pedadogy at a national level, symbolized in the lighthouse, the most powerful in South America and in the \"lighthouse effect\" that symbolized having a university in Playa Ancha and not in the center of Valparaiso as the other houses of study did traditionally. ==Faculties and careers== Main Campusalt= Performing Arts Hall Faculty of Science and EngineeringTraslavi\u00f1a Campus Punt\u00e1ngeles Building Independencia Campus Institutional Building Library Gran Breta\u00f1a Building The Playa Ancha University has 36 undergraduate degrees in Valparaiso (of which 3 are dual day and evening courses) and 6 in San Felipe.

In 2007 the construction of the new university library began, located near the most important buildings of the institution. The project includes an ambitious and modern service for more than ten thousand students, who will be able to access one of the most modern and complete libraries in the region. === Administration === During its existence, the Playa Ancha University has belonged to the University of Chile, depending directly on the Faculty of Humanities and Letters of Santiago; and, after the 1968 University Reform, to the Valpara\u00edso branch of the Casa de Bello, both as an Area-Faculty of Humanities, at first, and later as a Faculty of Education and Letters. This determined that its superior authorities were named Director, and later, Dean. As a consequence of the 1981 University Reform, it became an independent entity, either as the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valpara\u00edso, or as the University of Playa Ancha. Here, its superior authority is called Rector. ==== Directors, Pedagogical Institute of Valpara\u00edso - University of Chile ==== Oscar Guzm\u00e1n Escobar (1948-1955) [Private] Milton Rossel Acu\u00f1a (1955-1957) Juan Uribe Echevarr\u00eda (1957-1961) Rodolfo Iturriaga Jamett (1961-1965) Carlos Pantoja G\u00f3mez (1965-1969) ==== Deans, Faculty of Humanities/Education and Literature.
