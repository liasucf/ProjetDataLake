Retrieved 24 The souks of Dubai have a rich history of trade within the Persian Gulf region and have developed overtime as Dubai urbanised rapidly. Traditionally, the Dubai Textile Souk was a commercial hub of the exchange in textiles, for functional use of making clothes or for special occasions. Over the years and through Dubai\u2019s rapid globalisation, its commercial importance has since faded and has become a more tourist-focused. Thomas, G. (2010). The Rough Guide to Dubai (1st ed.). Rough Guides. One of the traditional sikkas in the Dubai Textile Souk == History == === Trade in Dubai leading to development of Textile Souk === Dubai played a major role in trade of the Persian Gulf as a part of the Ottoman Empire, settling since at least 1799. At the time the 7 emirate shaykhdoms had their on monarchies, Dubai being one of these emirates.Rizvi, K. (2017). Dubai, Anyplace: Histories of Architecture in the Contemporary Middle East. A Companion To Islamic Art And Architecture, 48, 1245-1266. doi: 10.1002/9781119069218.ch48 Around the 1820s, with the protection of the British Navy, as they assisted in disrupting constant raids to the Dubai Creek, the sleepy fishing villages of Dubai began to concentrate on making money through trade. The commerce of Dubai revolved around the Dubai Creek as unlike other creeks along the north coast region it was long, ultimately paving way for cargo ships coming from the Persian Gulf. Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009). Time Out Dubai (4th ed.). Time Out. The Maktoum families rule began in the nation in 1833, and they situated themselves in Shindagah, which had easy access to Dubai\u2019s source of wealth, which at the time was pearls and fishing within the creek and the Persian Gulf. As the pearling industry thrived, the results were exported to India and Europe. Trade with India and Persia in particular, stimulated foreign traders to begin trading in the city port. Dubai soon gained a reputation as a commerce capital but also as a place hospitable towards non-Arabs conducting business. Mathew, N. (2014). Understanding Space, Politics and History in the Making of Dubai, a Global City. Department Of History, Faculty Of Humanities, University Of The Witwatersrand,. By the mid-19th century, Shindagah held 250 Arab homes, neighbouring suburb, Bur Dubai, which is now the home of the Dubai Textile Souk (or Old Souk), housed 100 Indian traders and across the creek at Deira had 1,600 homes with a mixture of culture, housing Arabs, Persians and Baluchis (now known as Pakistan).Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009). Time Out Dubai (4th ed.). Time Out. The pearl industry continued to bring wealth to the Creek and increased the population greatly, coupled with the progressive, liberal lead of Maktoum bin Hashar in 1894, who thoroughly encouraged commerce and trading, the Old Souk begun and was constructed during this time. In 1902, Dubai saw a spike in migrating Iranian traders and Arab settlers and the commerce hub boasted the largest souks in Arabia, including the Old Souk. Emirates Group. (2020). Dubai History. Retrieved 24 April 2020, from https://www.emirates.com/au/english/discover-dubai/dubai-history/ === Modern Era: Worldwide recession and discovery of oil === As a result the worldwide recession in the 1930s post World War One, trade within the Dubai Creek came to a halt, and the Dubai Textile Souk struggled. And with World War Two looming at the end of the 1930s, trade was further affected during this period.Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009). Time Out Dubai (4th ed.). Time Out. Although Dubai quickly recovered from the second world war as oil is discovered in the Trucial States, sparking a major economic boost for the region where immigration, trade and general business flourished.Krane, J. (2009). Dubai: The Story of the World's Fastest City (1st ed.). New York: St. Martin's Press. As a result, the growth in the Indian and Pakistani population of Dubai gave new life to the Dubai Textile Souk. The discovery of oil was a game-changer for Dubai, and is what ultimately sparked the rapid globalisation of the city. In 1971 a Dubai International Airport was established and opened. By 1979, Jebel Ali Port and the Dubai Trade Centre, the first high rise buildings were erected, the first of many ambitious, rapid and phenomenal architectural projects. This intense modernisation of Dubai, ultimately is what sparked an increase in tourism within the city.UAE BARQ. (2018).

This rapid change from traditional to modern, coupled with the increase in tourism, the Dubai Textile souk became a key tourist attraction of the \u2018old Dubai\u2019. The old Souk\u2019s actual trade use was eradicated by the globalisation, hence vendors altered what they were selling to be more popular with tourists whilst also keeping some traditions. Although trade is still prevalent along the Dubai Creek, the souk\u2019s play less of a roll in the process on a large scale level. There still some wholesale companies behind souk areas, but they do not play large roles in trade. Mathew, N. (2014). Understanding Space, Politics and History in the Making of Dubai, a Global City. Department Of History, Faculty Of Humanities, University Of The Witwatersrand,. === Indian and Pakistani influence === The history of the Bur Dubai and Dubai Creek region which is where the Dubai Textile Market is located, has led to a large Indian and Pakistani influence due to the large amount of Indian and Pakistani traders having settled in the region over the history of trade in the Dubai Creek Region.Vora, N. (2013). Impossible Citizens: Dubai's Indian Diaspora. Durham: Duke University Press. This has formed what is now known as \u2018Hindi Lane\u2019 which consists of little Indian shops selling arrays of bindis, bangles, flowers, saris and other religious items. Indian influence has also formed other main sections of the textile souk such as Al Fahidi Street where vendors mainly sell Indian clothes, shoes and jewellery. Similarly, the Pakistani influence is seen in the selling of pashminas traditionally from Pakistan and salwar kameez, the traditional outfit of Pakistan.Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009).

(2018). Urban Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula, the Experiences of Jeddah and Dubai. Built Heritage, 3, 107-121. The general architecture of the souk consists of covered allies lined with small vendors displaying their products. The allies, which are traditionally known as sikkas are covered by very tall wooden arches that are designed to allow for air ventilation to keep cool in the heat.Cutler, A. (2018). 6 of the best souks and markets in Dubai. Retrieved 21 March 2020, from https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/explore-dubai/souks-guide/ This is achieved through the gaps between the wooden arches and the walls of the buildings, firstly for hot hair to rise out and wind draft to come in. The arches are in sections with gaps in between each section and have traditional Arabic lamps within each arch section. The arches are held by industrial style large metal pillars, these a modern addition maintain the traditional arches as the former structure had weakened over time.Ricca, S. (2018). Urban Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula, the Experiences of Jeddah and Dubai. Built Heritage, 3, 107-121. === Pre-Modern era of traditional walkable souks === The pre-modern architecture of souks was developed prior to the 1960s. Walkability is an essential in the extreme weather of Dubai, narrow alleys (sikkas) of the shopping streets of the Old Souk providing essential day-long shade and increased the likelihood of wind velocity, particularly from the Dubai Creek, helping to lower temperatures. To further reduce temperatures in the souk are the barajeel, which are wind towers perched on top of traditional merchant house, which was effective throughout history as technology and electricity were not around.Sunday Times.

Gypsum panels and gypsum powder were used to decorate, for example for floral and geometric ornamentation or patterns throughout the souk. These items were what was locally available at the time. === Modern era of souk architecture === Post 1960s, immigrant levels increased, oil wealth was found and Dubai was globalising into a major world city. UNESCO World Heritage nomination aimed at \u2018preserving and enhancing the traditional Dubai Creek harbour and its surrounding historic souks\u2019.Ricca, S. (2018). Urban Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula, the Experiences of Jeddah and Dubai. Built Heritage, 3, 107-121. This rapid need for city development shifted architecture throughout Dubai from locally sourced materials to heavy, pre-fabricated materials leading to intense modular construction. Although, whilst Dubai was swiftly advances, the souks were being preserved and construction within them was only for restorative, functional purposesRicca, S. (2018). Urban Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula, the Experiences of Jeddah and Dubai. Built Heritage, 3, 107-121.. The traditional souks such as the Dubai Textile Souk, are renowned for the maintenance of traditional architecture with slight modern advances and structures, such as the supporting metal pylons in the Dubai Textile souk. The animated sikkas and shops in fact still bear the names of ancient merchant families who immigrated from places such as Persia and IndiaVora, N. (2013). Impossible Citizens: Dubai's Indian Diaspora. Durham: Duke University Press.. The restoring and preserving of traditional architecture in the Dubai Textile Souk has not only maintained the culture of historical Dubai but also has encouraged influxes of tourists, promoting the economy of the souk and Dubai. == Economy of the souk == Dubai\u2019s historic centre, Bur Dubai and ultimately the Dubai Textile Souk still holds a relevant share of income in Dubai\u2019s commerce atmosphere and the original business merchants, shipmen and culture within such souks and areas have been preserved.

Urban Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula, the Experiences of Jeddah and Dubai. Built Heritage, 3, 107-121. Now the Dubai Textile Souk provides economic value through the large amounts of tourists that it attracts. === Payment methods === The main method of payment and preferred payment of vendors is cash, although there are credit card machine options available at some shops.Lyons, C. (2011). The Unofficial Guide to Dubai. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley. The souk is also surrounded by multiple ATM\u2019s allowing for tourists to get cash out if they need to do so. The currency of the souk is the local Dubai currency, Dirham (AED) with denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000. About one US dollar is worth AED 3.67, although this is susceptible to change in different economic environments.TransferWise. (2017). Money in Dubai: Banks, ATMs, Cards & Currency Exchange.

(2006). Dubai: The Complete Residents Guide (1st ed.). Dubai: Explorer. It is suggested that consumers look around at all stores before buying items as many of the vendors may have different stock at lower prices or similar stock that is of better quality. Bartering is very common in the Dubai Textile Souk, like most souks around the world.Explorer Publishing. (2006). Dubai: The Complete Residents Guide (1st ed.). Dubai: Explorer. It is thought that some vendors take advantage of tourists and charge more for their products, so bargaining is often encouraged.Groundwater, B. (2018). The 11 best ways to get ripped off overseas.
