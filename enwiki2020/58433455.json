In response to the charges, Fatoyinbo stepped down for a month and resumed preaching in August 2019. The case against him was dismissed by an Abuja court in November 2019 and Dakolo was fined one million naira for wasting the court's time. ==Campuses== Services are held weekly at the five campuses in Abuja, Lagos, Ilorin, Port Harcourt and Dubai.
