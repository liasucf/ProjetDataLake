In the first lap, Tyler Reddick slid through the grass and overshot the carousel, forcing him to pit and remove the grass from his grill. Ross Chastain turned Justin Allgaier into the fence after Allgaier drove across the nose of Chastain's car. In the final lap of Stage 1, Allgaier got revenge and slammed Chastain into the tire wall, ending Chastain's day. Busch took the win for stage 1. Christopher Bell took the lead afterwards, but was passed by Ryan Blaney, who quickly pulled away. Busch caught up to Blaney with 10 laps remaining in the stage and took the lead going into the carousel, but the suspension of Busch's car broke while exiting the carousel and went off- course, ending his day. A. J. Allmendinger managed to win Stage 2 until he had to pit, giving the lead to Allgaier, who in turn passed it to Austin Cindric until the caution was thrown for debris in the inner loop with 14 laps remaining. In the next restart, Justin Haley, Josh Bilicki and others got together and brought out the final caution. Allmendinger took the lead on the final restart, battling with Cindric via bumps and runs. In the end, Cindric managed to get by Allmendinger and held him off to win the race. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 20 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- ! Pos ! ! Driver ! Team !
