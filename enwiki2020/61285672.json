    "text": "The Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (JRC Medical Center) is a hospital located in Hiroo, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo. It is the central medical center of the Japanese Red Cross Society, and directly directly controlled by it. The site of Hiroo, Tokyo, where the medical center is currently located, was where a mansion of Horita Binakamori once stood. The Japanese Red Cross Hospital, the predecessor, was relocated to the current location in 1891. In front of the bus stop there is a circa 500-year-old tree, which is the largest ginkgo in the area with a perimeter of 4.7 meters or more, and was designated a natural monument in Shibuya-ku. The Empress is appointed as the Honorary Governor since 1949. == References == Category:Hospitals in Tokyo Category:Buildings and structures in Shibuya Category:Hospitals established in 1891 ",
