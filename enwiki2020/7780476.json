As of 2017, the population was estimated to be 105.http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasTowns/Barnhart-Texas.htm The Irion County Independent School District serves the students living in the area. Barnhart is suffering a drought exacerbated by the copious consumption of groundwater used in the hydraulic fracking process of petroleum extraction. Numerous oil rigs are located in the area. ==History== Barnhart was founded by Willam A. Barnhart in 1910, when the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway was constructed throughout West Texas, passing through the area. A post office opened in Barnhart in 1912, and a school operated in the community from 1912 to 1969. By 1920 the town had the Barnhart State Bank, which was moved to another town in 1927, and a newspaper, the Barnhart Range, published by Ed Downing. The population was estimated around 50 in 1915. In the 1920s and 30s, Barnhart became a large-volume shipping point, due to its location between major railroad lines. Barnhart was described as \"dusty, bawling cattle, hell- raising cowboys and trains a half-mile long\", in the 1920's and 30's. Barnhart had everything the cowboys and railroaders needed: A hotel, cafe, a bank and a theater. Because of the remoteness of West Texas, traditional cattle drives continued to Barnhart, long after the practice was popular. The amount of cattle coming through began to cause problems for the local ranchers. To protect the pastures from over-grazing, ranchers began to put up more fencing. This ended what may have been the beginning of the end to cattle drives in Texas. To get around the issue, the Ozona-Barnhart Trap Company was formed in 1924. A long, narrow path of leased/purchased land stretching 34 miles, from south of Ozona to Barnhart, became Texas\u2019 last major cattle trail. In April of 1934, Barnhart's former postmaster pled guilty in federal court to \u201cconversion of funds.\u201d Barnhart, which is out in the middle of the Texas plains, naturally lacked law enforcement at that time. During the depression, the federal government began buying up the cattle, and having them killed to reduce supply, hoping to revive a market that had practically died.http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasTowns/Barnhart-Texas.htm ==Climate== According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Barnhart has a semi- arid climate, abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Barnhart, Texas ==Highways== * * ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Irion County, Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:San Angelo, Texas metropolitan area Category:Populated places established in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Texas ",
