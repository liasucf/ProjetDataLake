The theatre group was created in 1995 by a group of students from the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting (\"Scenskolan\") in Malm\u00f6 and by students from the Swedish Institute of Dramatic Art (Dramatiska Institutet) in Stockholm. Teater Tribunalen is an outspoken political theatre group interested in influencing the society by challenging politic power, the government and nationally-debated issues with their work. In the spring of 2012, Ellen Nyman will direct \u201cA performance of Swedish Arms Exports\u201d( En f\u00f6rest\u00e4llning om svensk vapenexport) at Teater Tribunalen.
