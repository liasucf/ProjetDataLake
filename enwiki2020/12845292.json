    "text": "Harry George Drickamer (November 19, 1918 \u2013 May 6, 2002), born Harold George Weidenthal, was a pioneer experimentalist in high-pressure studies of condensed matter. His work generally concerned understanding the electronic properties of matter. Drickamer was born in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, to Louise Weidenthal and Harold Weidenthal. His father died when Harry was very young, and after his mother remarried, Harry's stepfather adopted him. After graduating early from public schools in East Cleveland, he played minor league professional baseball in the Cleveland Indians farm system, then entered Vanderbilt University on a football scholarship. He soon transferred to Indiana University and then to the University of Michigan, where he received a B.S. in chemical engineering in 1941 and master's degree one year later. In 1942 Drickamer began work at the Pan American Refinery in Texas City, Texas. After his fellow students played a prank by forging his name on a sign-up sheet for the Ph.D. qualifying exam in chemical engineering, he decided to take the 16-hour exam. After he started work in Texas, he received word that he had passed. He then combined work with study of physics and quantum mechanics, and in February 1946 returned to the University of Michigan for one term to receive his Ph.D. Drickamer joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he subsequently remained for his entire professional career. After his initial appointment as an assistant professor of chemical engineering in 1946, he was promoted to associate professor in 1949 and to full professor in 1953. In 1958 he was appointed professor of chemical engineering and physical chemistry, and in 1983 he became professor of chemical engineering, chemistry, and physics. ==Honors and awards== * 1947 Coburn Award, American Institute of Chemical Engineers * 1956 Ipatieff Prize, American Chemical Society * 1962 Fellow of the American Physical Society * 1965 Member of the National Academy of Sciences * 1967 Oliver E.

In honor of his outstanding achievements and hard work, one graduate student every year at Illinois from either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, or Physics will be awarded the Harry G. Drickamer Research Fellowship via the Drickamer Fund. Harry is the father of esteemed biochemist Kurt Drickamer, currently a professor at Imperial College London, discoverer of C-type Lectins. His other son, Lee C. Drickamer is a well-known animal behaviorist and textbook author who received the 2010 Distinguished Animal Behaviorist Award from the Animal Behavior Society. Now retired as Regents' Professor Emeritus, he spent his academic career at Williams College, Southern Illinois University, and Northern Arizona University. ==References== *Biographical Memoirs V.86 (2005) National Academy of Sciences, pp. 79-94. *Harry Drickamer Symposium Category:1918 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American chemical engineers Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:National Medal of Science laureates Category:Scientists from Cleveland Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:University of Michigan College of Engineering alumni Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society Category:Engineers from Ohio Category:20th-century American engineers Category:Oliver E.
