    "text": "Ballingarry (foaled 1999 in Ireland) is a Thoroughbred racehorse who competed for owners in Europe and North America. Bred and raced by the principals of Coolmore Stud, he was named for the village of Ballingarry in the southern part of County Tipperary in Ireland. In October 2002, he was sold to an American racing partnership led by Sidney L. Port. Ballingarry's most important wins came at age two in the Group One Crit\u00e9rium de Saint-Cloud at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in France and at age three in the Grade 1 Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto. Following his purchase by Sidney Port, Ballingarry notably won back-to-back editions of the Stars and Stripes Breeders' Cup Turf Handicap at Chicago's Arlington Park. Retired to stud duty, since 2005 Ballingarry has been standing at Charles-Henri de Moussac's Haras du Mezeray in Ticheville, Lower Normandy, France. ==References== * Ballingarry's pedigree and partial racing stats Category:1999 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 16-g ",
