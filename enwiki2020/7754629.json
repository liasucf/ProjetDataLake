Offering both comedies and drama, the series was sponsored by the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company. The title was shortened to Schlitz Playhouse, beginning with the fall 1957 season. ==Live to film== Initially, the show was broadcast live, but starting in the summer of 1953, some episodes were filmed in advance. Beginning with the 1956-1957 season, all of the shows were filmed. Between October 1951 and March 1952, the hour-long show was aired at 9 pm. In April 1952, the running time was reduced from an hour to 30 minutes. The series moved to 9:30 pm in the 1955 fall season. ==Pilots== Three episodes served as pilots for later NBC Western series: The Restless Gun with John Payne (March 29, 1957 pilot) and Tales of Wells Fargo with Dale Robertson, and the first-run syndication series Shotgun Slade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfvMQCih-Y Schlitz Playhouse Of Stars S08 E14 The Salted Mine - Pilot for Shotgun Slade with Scott Brady (Season 8 Episode 14, March 27, 1959).
