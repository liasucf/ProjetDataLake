Does planning how to cope with anticipated barriers facilitate health-related behaviour change? A systematic review, Health Psychology Review, 7:2, 129\u2013145, ==Approach== Coping planning aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help with distress, including suicidal ideation. By addressing why someone asks for help, the focus stays on what the person needs rather than on what the helper wants to do. It provides an alternative to the widely used, but non-evidence-based risk-assessment approach to suicide prevention.Franklin, J. C., Ribeiro, J. D., Fox, K. R., Bentley, K. H., Kleiman, E. M., Huang, X., et al. (2017). Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors: A meta-analysis of 50 years of research. Psychological Bulletin, 143(2), 187\u2013232 Needs assessment and support focuses on the individual needs of each person. They are rated as low (coping independently), moderate (may need additional low-intensity professional support), or high (needs immediate high-intensity professional support). ==Applications== In addition to suicide prevention training for health professionals, coping planning has been used to train journalists, and to help a range of people cope better, including carers, university students, and with children to improve emotional regulation. ===In suicide prevention=== Coping planning is designed to contribute to suicide prevention in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides a framework to support people whenever they seek help, rather than waiting until they are considered high-risk for death by suicide.Stallman, H. M. (2017). Meeting the needs of patients who have suicidal thoughts presenting to Emergency Departments. Emergency Medicine Australasia, 29(6), 749. Secondly, it aims to focus on helping people to cope, rather than to stay safe from suicide, which, according to ironic process theory,Wegner, Daniel M. (1989).
