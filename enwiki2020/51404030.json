    "text": "Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Below the Augustus Bridge is an oil on canvas by the Italian urban landscape painter Bernardo Bellotto. Painted in 1748, it depicts the view of Dresden from the right bank of the River Elbe, including the Dresden Frauenkirche, the Dresden Cathedral, and the Augustus Bridge. One year earlier, he painted another piece titled Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Above the Augustus Bridge, looking in the other direction from above the Augustus Bridge. Both of the paintings are in the permanent collection of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister. The paintings have proved invaluable in rebuilding parts of the city that were destroyed during the World War II. ==Lists of replicas== Between 1751 and 1753, Bellotto also executed smaller replicas of the two paintings. There are some other replicas from his own hand. * Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Below the Augustus Bridge, ca. 1750, National Gallery of Ireland. * Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Below the Augustus Bridge, Private Collection (Madrid).Andreas Henning, Sebastian Oesinghaus, Sabine Bendfeldt (eds.): Bernardo Bellotto Der Canaletto-Blick, Ausstellungskatalog anl\u00e4sslich der Kabinettausstellung zur Restaurierung des Gem\u00e4ldes 2011, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister * Dresden From the Right Bank of the Elbe Below the Augustus Bridge, 1751\u201353, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister. ==Gallery== File:Bernardo Bellotto, il Canaletto - Dresden vom rechten Elbufer unterhalb der Augustusbr\u00fccke (National Gallery of Ireland).jpg|A replica from National Gallery of Ireland ==See also== * Bombing of Dresden in World War II ==References== Category:1748 paintings Category:Collections of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister Category:Paintings by Bernardo Bellotto Category:Churches in art Category:Ships in art ",
