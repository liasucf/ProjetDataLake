In 1928, she founded, and the three of them later ran together, Cardozo Sisters Hairstylists.

Barker originally started the salon in her upstairs apartment but it later grew to have five storefront locations in Washington, D.C. Barker and her sister Margaret Cardozo Holmes would attend white trade shows to learn new techniques and find new products for their business. Jim Crow laws would normally prevent their entrance to these shows but the sisters \"passed for white\".The sisters sold the business after 50 years in 1978.

Her second husband Beltran Barker died in 1979. She died of a heart attack in 1981 at Cape Cod Community Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts. ==References== ==External links== *Elizabeth Cardozo Barker Interview Transcript, 1976-1981 OH-31.
