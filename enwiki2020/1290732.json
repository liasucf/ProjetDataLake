A martingale is a type of dog collar that provides more control over the animal without the choking effect of a slip collar. Martingale dog collars are also known as greyhound, whippet or humane choke collars. The martingale dog collar was designed for sighthounds because their necks are larger than their heads and they can often slip out of buckle collars. These collars have gained popularity among owners of other breeds in the recent past with many trainers now recommending them instead of choke chains or buckle collars. A martingale collar is made with two loops. The larger loop is slipped onto the dog's neck and a lead is then clipped to the smaller loop.
