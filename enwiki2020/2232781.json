It was also the beginning of distribution in North America, and other territories, under Sanctuary Records and their subsidiary Metal-Is. ==Recording== Hammered was released on Metal-Is, a rock label owned by the then-new Sanctuary Records. The album was recorded in the Hollywood Hills at Chuck Reid's house with Thom Pannunzio producing. By this time, Mot\u00f6rhead had recorded several albums as a three-piece, with drummer Mikkey Dee, guitarist Phil Campbell, and original vocalist/bassist, Lemmy. In Joel McIver's memoir Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot\u00f6rhead, Dee is quoted as saying the album \u2014 which is noted for its darker subject matter and reflective tone \u2014 was influenced by the 9/11 attacks: ==Release== In the Mot\u00f6rhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, Lemmy states: The album is perhaps best remembered for The Game, written by WWE music composer Jim Johnston as the entrance theme for wrestler Triple H. At two WrestleMania events, WrestleMania X-Seven and WrestleMania 21, Mot\u00f6rhead would perform this song live as Triple H made his entrance to the ring. Triple H also contributed co-vocals on the spoken word track \"Serial Killer\". ==Sleeve artwork== Joe Petagno, long time sleeve artist, had this insight into the concept of the album artwork: ==Reception== AllMusic review states: Lee Marlow of Classic Rock wrote in November 2013 that: ==Track listing== *Also includes a 16-minute mpeg on \"25 & Alive Boneshaker\", a preview of the (then) upcoming live album DVD of their 25th birthday concert in 2000, at the Brixton Academy, London. ==Personnel== Adapted from the Hammered liner notes. * Lemmy \u2013 lead vocals, bass * Phil Campbell \u2013 lead guitar * Mikkey Dee \u2013 drums * Dizzy Reed \u2013 piano on \"Mine all Mine\" * Triple H \u2013 Co-Vocals on \"Serial Killer\" * Bob Kulick - Guitars on \u201dThe Game\u201d === Production === * Thom Panunzio \u2013 producer (\"Serial Killer), engineer, mixing * Chuck Reed \u2013 producer, mixing (\"Serial Killer), engineer * Ian Kilmister \u2013 producer (\"Serial Killer) * Bob Kulick \u2013 producer, mixing (\"The Game\") * Bruce Buillet \u2013 producer (\"The Game\") * Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 producers (\"The Game\"), album cover design * Bob Koszela \u2013 engineer * Jim Danis \u2013 assistant engineers * Jeff Rothschild \u2013 assistant engineer * Bob Vosgien \u2013 mastering * Bruce Buillet \u2013 mixing (\"The Game\") * Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 executive producers * Joe Petagno \u2013 album cover design, Snaggletooth * Stefan Chirazi \u2013 concept * Mark Ambrose/Zen Jam \u2013 design *Gene Kirkland \u2013 photography ==References== ==External links== *Mot\u00f6rhead official website Category:2002 albums Category:Mot\u00f6rhead albums Category:Albums with cover art by Joe Petagno Category:Albums produced by Thom Panunzio Category:Sanctuary Records albums ",
