She operates the 22 NM route between the islands of \u00c6r\u00f8 and Als in Southern Denmark. ==History== Ellen was developed under E-Ferry, an EU-backed project costing EUR 21.3 million. Although this is around 40% more expensive than a conventional vessel, operating costs are 75% lower. She was the world's largest all- electric ferry in 2019, superseding the , which operates between Denmark and Sweden. It is expected that she will save the release of 2,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The ferry was built by S\u00f8by V\u00e6rft A/S, with sections fabricated in Szczecin, Poland. In September 2016, 22 sections were welded together and the hull was towed to S\u00f8by on \u00c6r\u00f8 for outfitting. ==Layout== Ellen can carry 30 vehicles and 200 passengers. She was designed to minimise weight. Her passenger areas are on the same level as the open car deck. She does not have ramps, instead using those on shore. The hull is steel but the bridge is made of aluminum. Deck furniture is made from recycled paper rather than wood, giving the ferry a total weight of 650 tonnes. Ellens batteries were developed by Leclanch\u00e9 of Switzerland and are reported to be Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide . They are split between two battery rooms below deck and have a capacity of 4.3 MWh, larger than any other electric vessel. She is one of the first such vessels to have no emergency generator. A charging arm on the shore ramp moves with the tide and allows battery recharging while loading. ==Service== Ellen was built to operate the 22 nautical miles between the islands of \u00c6r\u00f8 and Als in Southern Denmark. She replaced MF Skjoldn\u00e6s from 15 August 2019. ==Gallery== File:E-ferry Ellen.3.JPG|E-ferry Ellen File:E-ferry Ellen 01.JPG|E-ferry Ellen File:E-ferry Ellen 2.JPG|Caf\u00e9 File:E-ferry Ellen.6.JPG|4.3 MWh battery system File:E-ferry Ellen 4.JPG|Electric motor File:E-ferry Ellen 3.JPG|Electric motor File:E-ferry Ellen 5.JPG|Technical control room ==External links== *www.sebrochure.dk/e-ferry_UK ==References== Category:Ferries of Denmark Category:Electric boats Category:2016 ships Category:Ships built in Poland ",
