To capitalize on the 2017 Power Rangers movie, a comic book set shortly after the film's end entitled Aftershock was produced. A Justice League/Power Rangers crossover comic was also produced in conjunction with DC Comics. In July 2017, a second series called Go Go Power Rangers began with stories that take place before Tommy Oliver joined the team. In March 2018, both series started a crossover event for the 25th anniversary titled \"Shattered Grid\" with the tag line \"No Ranger is Safe\". This story line brought in rangers from all eras in a battle with a new villain, Lord Drakkon, an evil version of Tommy Oliver from an alternate reality. In September 2018, a new story line entitled \"Beyond the Grid\" began in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic series. Shifting focus away from the Mighty Morphin team, the new story deals with Grace Sterling and a new team of Power Rangers she has formed from the rangers that were displaced from normal space time (due to the events of \"Shattered Grid\") as they deal with a new villain and discover more mysteries about the Morphin Grid. In December 2018, the graphic novel Power Rangers: Soul of the Dragon released. The story focuses on an older Tommy Oliver who goes on one last ranger mission as he tries to find his son, an S.P.D. officer, who has mysteriously gone missing. ==Sales== The first issue of the 2016 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic sold approximately 100,000 copies. ==Reception== The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic has gained mostly positive critical reviews. ==References== Category:1994 comics debuts Category:1995 comics debuts Category:1996 comics debuts Category:2014 comics debuts Category:2016 comics debuts Category:Comics based on television series Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:Boom!
