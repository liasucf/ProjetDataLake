On Tuesday 17 September 2019, Cricket moved location into Liverpool\u2019s Metquarter. ==History== Originally starting in 1991 as a menswear boutique in Cavern Walks on Liverpool\u2019s famous Mathew Street by Gerard Mannix and Justine Mills, Cricket moved into exclusive high-end ladies fashion in 1999. Cricket was one of the first and very few independent retailers to stock Christian Louboutin shoes and accessories and was chosen alongside Harrods and Harvey Nichols to celebrate Louboutin\u2019s 20th anniversary limited edition collection in 2012. Co-founder and buyer, Justine Mills, is considered a respected fashion industry expert and businesswoman, recognised by the British Fashion Council as one of their representatives and part of their selection committee. British designer, Matthew Williamson, hosted Cricket's Celebration Of Style event across Liverpool city centre in November 2014 in association with Matalan. Cricket was named as one of The 50 Best Boutiques in Britain by The Daily Telegraph in 2019, published by Sunday supplement, Stella Magazine. ==New Store== Cricket confirmed speculation that they were moving location in December 2018 with the unveiling of huge hoardings across the front of Liverpool city centre\u2019s celebrated shopping centre, the Metquarter. ==WAGs== In 2005, The Guardian dubbed Cricket Fashion \"an unofficial footballers' wives' headquarters\" with paparazzi regularly camping outside the shop in a bid to see which WAGs of footballers from Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United were shopping there. Regulars include Coleen Rooney, Alex Curran (wife of Steven Gerrard), ex-Emmerdale actress Sheree Murphy and Abbey Clancy (wife of Peter Crouch). Famously, Coleen Rooney was first photographed by the press in 2003 as the then girlfriend of Wayne Rooney; she was 16 years old and in her school uniform carrying a Cricket Fashion carrier bag. == References == Category:Clothing retailers of England Category:Retail companies established in 1991 Category:Clothing retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Clothing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Clothing companies of England Category:1991 establishments in England Category:Retail companies of England ",
