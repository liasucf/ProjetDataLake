    "text": "The Mississippi State Lottery is a lottery authorized by the Alyce G. Clarke Mississippi Lottery Law in 2018. It is administered by the Mississippi Lottery Corporation. The corporation expected to begin scratch off sales by December 1, 2019, with sales of draw game tickets in 2020. However, this was bought forward to November 25th as announced by Mississippi Lottery Corporation. On August 2, 2019, the Mississippi Lottery Corporation announced its acceptance into the Multi-State Lottery Association, with sales of Mega Millions and Powerball beginning on January 30, 2020. Unlike most U.S. lotteries, the minimum age to buy tickets is 21, the same as neighboring Louisiana. == Lottery Act == The Alyce G. Clarke Mississippi Lottery Act was passed by the Mississippi House of Representatives on August 28, 2018 in a 58-54 vote, following a 60-54 vote against the bill the previous day. The bill states that net proceeds up to $80 million will be paid into the State Highway Fund each fiscal year until June 30, 2028. Proceeds above the $80 million threshold will be paid into Mississippi's Education Enhancement Fund. From July 1, 2028 net proceeds up to $80 million will be transferred into the Lottery Proceeds Fund and from there into the State General Fund. Proceeds above $80 million will continue to be transferred into the Education Enhancement Fund. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed the bill on August 31, 2018. == History == While Mississippi was an early adopter of casino gambling (primarily in the town of Tunica and along the Gulf of Mexico), like many other Bible Belt states it was reluctant to start a state lottery due to opposition from religious leaders. In addition, casino operators were against a lottery as it could potentially sway punters away from gambling halls. The formation of a state lottery in Mississippi was made possible in November 1992, when fifty-three percent of the state's electorate voted to repeal Section 98 of Article 4 of the Mississippi Constitution, which read: \u201cNo lottery shall ever be allowed, or be advertised by newspapers, or otherwise, or its tickets be sold in this state; and the Legislature shall provide by law for the enforcement of this provision; nor shall any lottery heretofore authorized be permitted to be drawn or its tickets sold.\u201d In 2004, Alyce Clarke introduced a bill to create a state lottery in Mississippi but met with strong opposition from Republican Governor Haley Barbour and the leaders of both houses of legislature, so much so that the Mississippi Baptist Convention did not feel the need to mobilize its own opposition. == Current games == === Scratch-offs === The Mississippi State Lottery launched its first four scratch-off games - $100,000 Jackpot, 3 Times Lucky, Happy Holidays Y'All, and Triple 7 - at 05:00 on November 25th 2019. Over $2.5 million of sales were recorded in the first day and $8.9 million in the first week. === Multi-jurisdictional games === Mississippi started selling Mega Millions and Powerball tickets on January 30, 2020. ==References== Category:State lotteries of the United States ",
