She was the daughter of William Earl Rowe; Wadds and Rowe are, to date, the only father and daughter to sit as MPs in the same session of Parliament. In 1946, she married Arza Clair Casselman, who represented Grenville\u2014Dundas in the House of Commons until his death in 1958, and she was elected to the same seat later that year.

She was the first woman to serve as a parliamentary secretary in the Canadian government. She was defeated in the 1968 federal election in the redistributed riding of Grenville\u2014Carleton but remained politically active, serving from 1971 to 1975 as national secretary of the Progressive Conservative party. She served on the Ontario Municipal Board in the late 1970s. ==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom== In 1979, Wadds was appointed Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. She served in this capacity until 1983. During this time, the Canadian Constitution was patriated. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was to say of her: > \"I always said it was thanks to three women that we were eventually able to > reform our Constitution. The Queen, who was favourable, Margaret Thatcher, > who undertook to do everything that our Parliament asked of her, and Jean > Wadds, who represented the interests of Canada so well in London.\" In 1982, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for carrying \"out her duties with great competence and conscientiousness, particularly during the period of the patriation of the Constitution\".Governor General of Canada - Honours ==Macdonald Commission and later career== Returning to Canada in 1983, she was appointed one of 13 commissioners on the Macdonald Commission into the economic future of Canada. The Royal Commission's recommendations that Canada negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States were ultimately taken up by the government of Brian Mulroney, resulting in the Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement of 1988. She subsequently served on a number of corporate boards including Bell Canada, Canadian Pacific and Royal Trust.
