    "text": "Bangladesh Cadet Colleges Monogram The following is the list of cadet colleges located in Bangladesh. Cadet College is a residential special school-cum- college established in East Pakistan, present day Bangladesh on the model of English public schools. It was put under the direct management and supervision of the armed forces of the country and military education was made compulsory in it. After liberation of Bangladesh, The Cadet Colleges Order (PO 89) of 1972 issued guidelines for restructuring the councils and governing bodies of the cadet colleges. According to new provisions, the Education Minister became the ex-officio chairman of the council and the divisional commissioner the chairman of the governing body. The Cadet College Act 1973 brought some changes in the provisions. The two management bodies of the cadet colleges were further restructured and were placed under direct control of the Ministry of Defence. There have been periodic changes in the management structure because of changes in the government, but the basic principles have so far remained undisturbed. At present, the Adjutant General of the Bangladesh Army Acts, as the chairman of the governing bodies of all cadet colleges and the Defence Secretary is the highest authority in all matters relating to their funding and operation. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" !width=\"10%\"| No. !width=\"30%%\"| Name !width=\"20%\"| Location !width=\"20%\"| Division !width=\"15%\"| Area (acre) !width=\"15%\"| Established |- |01 | Faujdarhat Cadet College | Faujdarhat,Chittagong | Chittagong | 185 | 1958 |- |02 | Jhenaidah Cadet College | Jhenaidah | Khulna | 103 | 1963 |- | 03 | Mirzapur Cadet College | Mirzapur, Tangail | Dhaka | 95 | 1963 |- | 04 | Rajshahi Cadet College | Sardah, Rajshahi | Rajshahi | 110 | 1965 |- | 05 | Sylhet Cadet College | Sylhet | Sylhet | 52.37 | 1978 |- | 06 | Rangpur Cadet College | Alamnagar, Rangpur |Rangpur | 37 | 1979 |- | 07 | Barisal Cadet College | Rahmatpur, Barisal | Barisal | 50 | 1981 |- | 08 | Pabna Cadet College | Pabna | Rajshahi | 38 | 1981 |- | 09 | Mymensingh Girls Cadet College | Mymensingh || Mymensingh | 23 | 1983 |- | 10 | Comilla Cadet College | Kotbari, Comilla | Chittagong | 52 | 1983 |- | 11 | Feni Girls Cadet College | Feni | Chittagong | 49.5 | 2006 |- | 12 | Joypurhat Girls Cadet College | Joypurhat | Rajshahi | 57 | 2006 |} ==See also== * List of cadet colleges in Pakistan *Cadet College Club Limited Category:Military of Bangladesh Category:Bangladesh education-related lists ",
