    "text": "Tkalec Manor - southeast view Tkalec Manor ( or ) is a baroque building structure situated next to the village of \u0160trigova in Me\u0111imurje County, northern Croatia. It was built in the mid-18th century and first owned by the members of the Pauline Catholic Order in \u0160trigova, until their order was abolished by the Croato-Hungarian king Joseph II of Habsburg in 1786. In the 19th century it was owned by the counts of Zichy, who had estates in the neighbouring Slovenian region of Prekmurje as well. Before the national independence of Croatia, it was until 1990 run by local peasant's agricultural cooperative society. After that it was privatized and renewed. The manor itself has a long porch with arcades in the southeastern side. There is a large cellar inside with an old and huge wooden wine press from 1858. It was used for the wine production based on the widespread vineyards on the surrounding hills of that area. Since the manor is located on a high hill (one of the highest peaks in the County), there is a nice view from it to the beautiful landscape of the Upper Me\u0111imurje. == Gallery == File:Dvorac Tkalec, \u0160trigova - istok.jpg|East view of the Manor File:Dvorac Tkalec, \u0160trigova - ulaz.jpg|Manor entrance File:Dvorac Tkalec, \u0160trigova - jug.jpg|South view of the Manor ==See also== * List of castles in Croatia * Zichy Category:Buildings and structures in Me\u0111imurje County Category:Castles in Croatia ",
