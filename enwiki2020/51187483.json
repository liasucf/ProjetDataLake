    "text": "Jean Saas (4 February 1703, Saint-Pierre-de-Franqueville \u2013 20 April 1774) was an 18th-century French historian and bibliographer. == Biography == At college of Rouen where he studied, Saas distinguished himself by his talent for Latin poetry. Having embraced the ecclesiastical state, he became one of the secretaries of the archbishop of Rouen and took advantage of the leisure left to him by this modest employment to become familiar with reading charts and study in depth the History of Normandy. Provided the cure of Saint-Jacques- sur-Darn\u00e9tal, he soon resigned this benefit and accepted instead a position of librarian of the metropolitan chapter, which would facilitate the means to indulge his taste for historical and literary research. In the trial the chapter had to support against the Benedictines of the abbaye de Saint-Ouen, father Saas showed great zeal for the maintenance of the privileges of his church, and he was rewarded in 1751 by a canonry. Saas was known for a long time in an advantageous manner as a bibliographer. The assiduous reading of historical dictionaries proved him that those who were most esteemed were not error-free, and he was quick to point out, in small scholarly writings, those he had noticed. He was going to press a volume of notes forming a useful supplement to the latest edition of the Dictionaire of Mor\u00e9ri, when the sudden weakening of his forces forced him to give up all kind of work. He died suddenly after lingering a few years. Abbot Saas was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen since its founding, and he had shared the work with zeal, but the fate of the memoirs he had shared with this company is unknown.The list of these various pieces, sixteen in number, are to be found in the \u00c9loge de Saas, by Cotton, (p. 22). The first is a Lettre sur les po\u00e8tes de Normandie, read 21 December 1745, and inserted by Goujet in his Biblioth\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise, vol.6. Haillet de Couronne read his \u00c9loge of which an extract can be found in the Recueil de l\u2019acad\u00e9mie by M. Gosseaume, vol.4, (p. 286). Another praise of abbot Saas, by Cotton Deshoussayes, was printed in Paris, Berton, 1776, in-8\u00b0 (35 pages). == Publications == * Fables choisies by la Fontaine, translated into Latin verse bys PP. Vinot and Tissard, Anvers (Rouen), 1738, in-12 de 288 p. (This volume includes several pieces such as the Combat des rats et des grenouilles, by Calenzio ; Solitude, by Saint-Amant ; l\u2019Horloge de sable, by Gilles de Caux, with translations in Latin.) * Nouveau Dictionnaire historique portatif, corrected and augmented with several articles, Avignon (Rouen), 1769, 4 vol. in-8\u00b0. * Nouveau pouill\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices du dioc\u00e8se de Rouen, ibid., 1738, in-4\u00b0 ; * Lettres \u00e0 l\u2019auteur du Suppl\u00e9ment au Dictionnaire de Mor\u00e9ri, (abb\u00e9 Goujet), (1742), in-12 de 117 pages.(Goujet frankly admitted his mistakes, and far from being angry against his critic, they became friends despite their difference of opinion, because Saas was devoted to the Jesuits.) * Notice des manuscrits de la biblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019\u00e9glise m\u00e9tropolitaine de Rouen,ibid., 1746, in-12 de rom XXIII, 116 pages. (The preface contains the history of the library dispersed during wars and renewed in 1636 by canon Acarie, whose example was followed by many of his colleagues. Dom Tassin strongly criticized the booklet of father Saas, who replied with a pamphlet entitled R\u00e9futation de l\u2019\u00e9crit du P. Tassin, etc., 1747, in-12 de 49 pages. * Lettre sur le troisi\u00e8me volume du Dictionnaire de Chaufepi\u00e8, dans les M\u00e9moires de Tr\u00e9voux, 1754, p. 2918-2940 ; * Elogia in obitum D. de Fontenelle, lecta, etc., Rouen, 1757, in-8\u00b0 ; * Lettres d\u2019un professeur de Douai \u00e0 un professeur de Louvain sur le Dictionnaire historique portatif de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Ladvocat et sur l\u2019Encyclop\u00e9die,Saas, qui donna depuis, sous la rubrique d\u2019Avignon, l\u2019\u00e9dition de 1769 du Dictionnaire historique de Dom Chaudon, avait peut-\u00eatre eu quelque part au Dictionnaire anonyme, in 6 volumes in-8\u00b0, dont Ladvocat fit une critique divis\u00e9e en Fautes de g\u00e9ographie. Fautes et b\u00e9vues de toute esp\u00e8ce. Fautes de dates et de chronologie. Le chanoine de Rouen emploie la m\u00eame forme, avec un plus grand nombre de divisions, pour critiquer le Dictionnaire historique de Ladvocat, \u00e9dition de 1760 ; et ce dernier \u00e0 son tour, dans une lettre de Mercier de Saint-L\u00e9ger, qui ne fut publi\u00e9e qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 17C6, critiqua les premiers volumes du Nouveau Dictionnaire historique, auquel il supposait que Saas n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tranger, et dont il avait lu les deux premiers volumes avant sa mort: ces deux volumes, publi\u00e9s \u00e0 Avignon sous la rubrique d\u2019Amsterdam, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9s d\u00e8s 1765, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019aient paru qu\u2019en 1766, la lettre de Ladvocat, sous le pseudonyme de Pont-de-Ri, est dat\u00e9e de Cavaillon, 10 d\u00e9cembre 1765, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire dix-neuf jours avant sa mort. Douai (Rouen), 1762, in-8\u00b0 de 119 pages ; (Saas also points out several mistakes by Mor\u00e9ri in 1759.Among his unpublished works, we may regret a Chronologie en vers latins hexam\u00e8tres, a work of his youth, but one that Father Tournemine put a lot over the work of Father Labbe on the same subject.) * Lettres (au nombre de sept) sur l\u2019Encyclop\u00e9die pour servir de suppl\u00e9ment aux sept volumes de ce dictionnaire, Amsterdam (Rouen), 1764, in-8\u00b0; he only reports errors in geography, history and chronology. * Lettre \u00e0 l\u2019abb\u00e9 Goujet, contenant de nouvelles remarques sur lsotta, femme savante d\u2019Italie, dans le tome 5 des M\u00e9moires d\u2019Artigny. (It is believed that Saas lent his hand to the two letters by Pierre-Nicolas Midy, of the Acad\u00e9mie de Rouen, to Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, printer of the Grand Vocabulaire fran\u00e7ais, Amsterdam (Rouen), 1767, in-8\u00b0.) Saas had Hippolytus redivivus reprinted; he provided notes to Fontette for the Biblioth\u00e8que historique de la France; We owe him much of the project Affiches et annonces de la haute et basse Normandie, where he contributed several articles. Saas started under the name Anti-More\u00e9ri, a much larger work. The manuscript, forming 625 pages in- fol., extended only on the first five letters of the alphabet, mainly on TA. It passed into the hands of Drouet, who intended to make use of for a supplement (\u00c9loge de Saas, by Cotton, p. 30). == References == == Sources == * vol. 37, () Category:18th-century French historians Category:French bibliographers Category:French lexicographers Category:People from Normandy Category:1703 births Category:1774 deaths ",
