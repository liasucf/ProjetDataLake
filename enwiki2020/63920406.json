A Sansei, he was the eldest son of John Shuzo and Diane Yoshiye Nagatani. In 1955, the Nagatanis moved to Los Angeles, where they settled in the Crenshaw District, which at one time had the largest concentration of Japanese-Americans in the country. In Los Angeles, Nagatani attended Coliseum Street School, Audubon Jr. High School, and Dorsey High School. At Dorsey, he was an honor student, ran hurdles, and was an officer in student government. It wasn't until he started college at Cal State L.A. that he discovered his passion for the arts. Prior to pursuing a MFA degree at UCLA, Nagatani taught for the Los Angeles Unified School District at Hamilton High School. Later, he taught at Loyola Marymount University and at the University of New Mexico. As an artist, Nagatani's works have been exhibited internationally and have been featured in numerous publications and films. Nagatani died on October 27, 2017, at his home in Albuquerque. ==Exhibitions== === Selected solo exhibitions === * 1976 \u2013 Pal Gallery, Evergreen State University, Olympia, Washington * 1982 \u2013 Canon Photo Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Chromo- Therapy Series * 1991 \u2013 Jayne H.
