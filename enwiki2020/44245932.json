With her brother, she co-founded L'Arche UK, a branch of the international organisation dedicated to the communal care of people with learning disabilities, establishing the first community in Barfrestone near Canterbury in 1974. ==Biography== Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Vanier was born on 27 February 1923 in Camberley, Surrey to Pauline Vanier (n\u00e9e Archer), an appointed member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Georges Vanier, a decorated soldier and former Governor General of Canada. Her third name, Ch\u00e9risy, marks the location in France where her father lost a leg in the trenches during World War I. Vanier was the eldest of five children. Her brother Jean Vanier, a trained naval officer and Catholic philosopher founded the first L'Arche community in Trosly-Breuil, France in 1964. As a young adult Vanier studied at Mayfield in East Sussex. At the age of 19, she signed up with the British Mechanised Transport Corps and sailed in a convey as part of the Battle of the Atlantic. Vanier went on to join the Canadian Women\u2019s Army Corps, eventually rising to the rank of captain. After World War II Vanier studied medicine at the Sorbonne and Cambridge University. Vanier completed her clinical studies at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in Central London where she became the first female consultant in haematology. It was during this time that she met lifelong friend Cicely Saunders, a pioneer in hospice care, and the founder of St Christopher's Hospice. In 1972 Vanier resigned from her position at St Thomas' Hospital to join Saunders at St Christopher's where she taught and pursued clinical work in the burgeoning field of palliative care. Vanier opened the first English L'Arche community in January 1974 in Barfrestone near Canterbury in Kent. She went on to personally oversee the opening of four other communities. Today there are ten communities in the UK, including one in Lambeth, south London, where Vanier lived until her death in 2014. Vanier's Catholic Requiem mass took place at the Anglican Canterbury Cathedral on 10 July 2014. Her body was laid to rest at Barfrestone cemetery, around 100 metres from \"Little Ewell\", the first L'Arche Kent Community house she helped to establish in 1974. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2014 deaths Category:British palliative care physicians Category:20th-century British medical doctors Category:Palliative care in the United Kingdom Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:British humanitarians Category:British people of French descent Category:British people of Irish descent Category:Canadian female military personnel Category:History of the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Vanier family ",
