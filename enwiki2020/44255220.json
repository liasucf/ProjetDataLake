    "text": "Saraswati River is a tributary of Alaknanda River flowing in Uttarakhand State, India. It joins Alaknanda River at Keshav Prayag, near Mana village, Badrinath. Alaknanda River merges with Bhagirathi at Devprayag, Uttarakhand, which forms from that point the Ganges. A natural stone bridge, named \"Bhim Pul\", lays across flowing Saraswati river, making a passage towards Vasudhara falls and Satopanth Lake. It is believed by locals that Bhim Pul is a rock bridge founded by Bhima of Mahabharatha, to help Draupadi to cross the rivulet. ==References== Category:Rivers of Uttarakhand Category:Geography of Chamoli district Category:Rivers of India ",
