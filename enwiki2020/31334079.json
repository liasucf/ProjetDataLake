    "text": "Styela plicata is a tropical to temperate tunicate that has invaded the Gulf of Mexico by hitching a ride on ships' hulls. This sessile filter feeder can expel water when threatened, leading to the name \"sea squirt.\" This species is rather hardy; \"able to tolerate changes in seawater between 10\u00b0-30\u00b0C and salinites between 22%-34%\" (Thiyagarajan & Qian, 2003) as well as pollution and brackish water. This species is difficult to manage because of the large amount of fluctuation in its population; a colony may be large one year and absent the next. Preventative measures include anti-fouling paints, wood preservation, and slime control containing tributyltin. ==References== * Category:Stolidobranchia Category:Animals described in 1823 ",
