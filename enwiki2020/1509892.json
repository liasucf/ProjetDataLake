    "text": "The T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry is a prize that was, for many years, awarded by the Poetry Book Society (UK) to \"the best collection of new verse in English first published in the UK or the Republic of Ireland\" in any particular year. The Prize was inaugurated in 1993 in celebration of the Poetry Book Society's 40th birthday and in honour of its founding poet, T. S. Eliot. Since its inception, the prize money was donated by Eliot's widow, Mrs Valerie Eliot and more recently it has been given by the T S Eliot Estate. The T S Eliot Foundation took over the running of the T S Eliot Prize in 2016, appointing Chris Holifield, formerly director of the Poetry Book Society as its new director, when the former Poetry Book Society charity had to be wound up, with its book club and company name taken over by book sales agency Inpress Ltd in Newcastle. At present, the prize money is \u00a320,000, with each of nine runners-up receiving \u00a31500 each, making it the United Kingdom's most valuable annual poetry competition. The Prize has been called \"the most coveted award in poetry\". The shortlist for the Prize is announced in October of each year On the evening before the announcement of the Prize, the ten shortlisted poets take part in the Readings at the Royal Festival Hall in London's Southbank. 2000 people attended the 2011 reading. ==List of winners== *2019 \u2013 Roger Robinson, A Portable Paradise *2018 \u2013 Hannah Sullivan, Three Poems *2017 \u2013 Ocean Vuong, Night Sky with Exit Wounds *2016 \u2013 Jacob Polley, Jackself *2015 \u2013 Sarah Howe, Loop of Jade *2014 \u2013 David Harsent, Fire Songs *2013 \u2013 Sin\u00e9ad Morrissey, Parallax *2012 \u2013 Sharon Olds, Stag's Leap *2011 \u2013 John Burnside, Black Cat Bone *2010 \u2013 Derek Walcott, White Egrets *2009 \u2013 Philip Gross, The Water Table *2008 \u2013 Jen Hadfield, Nigh-No-Place *2007 \u2013 Sean O'Brien, The Drowned Book *2006 \u2013 Seamus Heaney, District and Circle *2005 \u2013 Carol Ann Duffy, Rapture *2004 \u2013 George Szirtes, Reel *2003 \u2013 Don Paterson, Landing Light *2002 \u2013 Alice Oswald, Dart *2001 \u2013 Anne Carson, The Beauty of the Husband *2000 \u2013 Michael Longley, The Weather in Japan *1999 \u2013 Hugo Williams, Billy's Rain *1998 \u2013 Ted Hughes, Birthday Letters *1997 \u2013 Don Paterson, God's Gift to Women *1996 \u2013 Les Murray, Subhuman Redneck Poems *1995 \u2013 Mark Doty, My Alexandria *1994 \u2013 Paul Muldoon, The Annals of Chile *1993 \u2013 Ciar\u00e1n Carson, First Language: Poems ==List of judges== *2019 \u2014 John Burnside, Sarah Howe and Nick Makoha *2018 \u2014 Clare Pollard, Sin\u00e9ad Morrissey and Daljit Nagra *2017 \u2014 W.
