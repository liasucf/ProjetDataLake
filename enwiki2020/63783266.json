She is the first person to hold that office. She rose to prominence in 2016 as the attorney of activist and social leader Milagro Sala. ==Early life and career== G\u00f3mez Alcorta was born in San Isidro, in the suburbs of the Greater Buenos Aires, in 1982. She studied law at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating in 1997 with honors; she is the first university graduate in her family. She is a member of the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS), and worked in the Justice Ministry and the Council of Magistracy, where she became involved in judicial matters pertaining to victims of state-sponsored terrorism during the last military dictatorship (1976\u20131983). Additionally, she has been a faculty of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, her alma mater. She rose to prominence in 2016 as the defending attorney of activist and social leader Milagro Sala, who stands accused of embezzlement. According to G\u00f3mez Alcorta, Sala was \"sentenced for being a woman\", and the charges against her constitute a \"witch-hunt never seen before in the democratic era\"; she maintains Sala is a political prisoner. G\u00f3mez Alcorta is a member of Mala Junta, a \"feminist, popular, mixed and dissident\" collective organized within the Patria Grande Front. She is a vocal supporter of the legalization of abortion in Argentina. ==Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity== Ahead of the 2019 general election, then- presidential candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez announced his intention of creating of a new government ministry dedicated to overseeing public policies pertaining to women's issues, especially the issue of gender-based violence against women. G\u00f3mez Alcorta was touted by Fern\u00e1ndez and vice-presidential candidate Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to head the new ministry ahead of the Frente de Todos ticket's victory in the 2019 election. Under G\u00f3mez Alcorta's vision, the new ministry was subdivided into two secretariats, one dedicated to designing and implementing policies to mitigate gender-based violence against women, and another tasked with implementing policies related to equality and gender and sexual diversity. G\u00f3mez Alcorta has stated that the ministry's ultimate goal is \"to mainstream and federalize gender policies across the Government's administration\". In July 2020, G\u00f3mez Alcorta presented a $ 18,000 million-national plan against gender-based violence projected for the 2020-2022 period, aimed at reducing extreme violence, ensuring economic autonomy for victims of gender-based violence and seizing cultural and structural aspects. The plan establishes 15 points of action, including the establishment of integral territorial centers, a revamp of the 144 gender violence emergency line, and economic help for women and LGBT+ people at risk. ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity (in Spanish) Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Argentine feminists Category:Argentine human rights activists Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Government ministers of Argentina Category:Women government ministers of Argentina Category:Women's ministers Category:People from San Isidro, Buenos Aires Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni ",
