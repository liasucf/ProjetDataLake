It is owned by AT&T; Latin America. It produces TV content, and owns several TV channels. As of 2018, DirecTV Latin America's legal name was changed to Vrio Corp.https://about.att.com/pages/company_profile_latin_america ==History== DirecTV SF6 2-LNB \"Round\" satellite dish only in Latin America In 1994, Hughes Electronics Corporation and Venezuelan media company Grupo Cisneros create a joint venture named Galaxy Latin America, a company intended to distribute DirecTV services in 27 Latin American countries, initially with an offer of 144 channels. In that same year, it enters the Chilean market and then it was launched in Mexico. In 2000, Galaxy Latin America LLC was renamed as DirecTV Latin America LLC. In 2005, Grupo Cisneros sold its 14% stake on DirecTV Latin America to The DirecTV Group Inc.https://www.portafolio.co/economia/finanzas/grupo-cisneros-vende-parte- directv-latina-173300 While in Mexico and Brazil it merged with rival Sky and disappeared, in South America it absorbed Sky as the latter struggled in the market. On 19 January 2016, the Secretary of Environment of Bogot\u00e1, sanctioned DirecTV's Colombian subsidiary, Directv Colombia Ltda., with a sum of $118 million for placing advertisement without the proper permission from the city.http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/sancion-a-directv-por-publicidad-exterior- ilegal/16485402?ts=42 (Spanish) The company violated Decree 959, published in 2000, that regulates where companies can place public publicity. On 15 September 2017, Reuters reported that AT&T;, the owner of DirecTV's U.S. and Latin American divisions, had hired an advisor to consider offering DirecTV Latin America on the public stock market. The principal motive was cited as the need to reduce the debt load AT&T; would assume if it took over Time Warner as planned. Since that date, the U.S. Dept. of Justice filed suit to block that acquisition on antitrust grounds, a trial is scheduled to start on 19 March 2018 before Judge Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and a decision is not expected before June\u2013July. However, even if the deal is blocked, AT&T; might dispose of the division as not core to its business.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-m-a-latamdivestiture- exclusive/exclusive-att-weighs-divestiture-of-latin-american-tv-assets- sources-idUSKCN1BR008 On 19 April 2018, the IPO was cancelled. On 19 May 2020, the company ceased operations in Venezuela, due to US sanctions against pro- Maduro TV channels Globovisi\u00f3n and PDVSA TV in 2019.
