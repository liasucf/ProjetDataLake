    "text": "Biscarrosse is a commune in the Landes department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. It is located southwest of Bordeaux, and inland from the seaside resort of Biscarrosse-Plage on the Atlantic coast. Near Biscarrosse is the CEL (national test centre) from which numerous French military rockets have been launched for test purposes. Likewise, the CEL has facilities for launching civilian rockets to study the upper atmosphere. Near the town centre, outside the Caf\u00e9 de l'orme, there was what is believed to have been the oldest elm tree in Europe. Planted in 1350, this Field Elm Ulmus minor died in 2010 after finally succumbing to Dutch elm disease.http://www.pijouls.com/albums/alblormedebiscarrosse/page_01.htm Legend has it that girls deemed promiscuous were forced to stand naked upon a barrel beneath the tree for a day. One unfortunate, unjustly accused, died of shame, the tree annually producing a corona of blanched leaves in her memory. The commune has an airport, called Biscarrosse - Parentis Airport. == Etymology == The toponym Biscarrosse derives from the Aquitanian language or directly from the Basque word bizkar, meaning 'low ridge' or 'prominence' followed by the Aquitanian suffix -ossum/-os, that was used to mark presence. Related toponyms are Biscay and Biscarru\u00e9s. ==Climate== ==Population== == Seaplane activity== Nearby Hourtiquet once hosted an important seaplane base, serving the builder Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re and airlines A\u00e9ropostale and its successor Air France. A seaplane museum exists at the shores of the Lac de Biscarrosse et de Parentis. During World War II the base served German military seaplanes; two Dornier 24 flying boats were recovered from the lake in 1980 and 1981.http://www.preservedaxisaircraft.com/Luftwaffe/dornier/dornier.htm Since 1991, the lake has seen bi-annual seaplane fly-ins. Lake Biscarosse ==Oil exploration== After the demise of seaplanes after WW2, the lake gained new interest at the discovery of petroleum. It has the greatest reserve in France. Petroleum exploitation is situated on the shores of the lake, in the commune of Parentis. ==Education== * \u00c9cole nationale de l'aviation civile ==References== *INSEE statistics == External links == *Univ-perp *Astronautix *Tourist Office *Biscaloc Category:Communes of Landes (department) ",
