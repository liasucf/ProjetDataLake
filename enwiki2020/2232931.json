The narrow fjord is a branch of the large Sognefjord, and it is featured on the \"Norway in a Nutshell\" daytrips for tourists. The long fjord is only wide in some parts. The river N\u00e6r\u00f8ydalselvi flows down the valley N\u00e6r\u00f8ydalen into the fjord at the village of Gudvangen, near the European route E16 highway. The village of Bakka and the Bakka Church are both located on the west shore of the fjord. Since 2005, the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has also been rated by the National Geographic Society as the world's number one natural heritage site along with the Geirangerfjord. ==In popular culture== N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord was also used as an inspiration for Arendelle in Frozen. ==Media gallery== File:N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden from Bakkanosi.jpg|N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden from Bakkanosi File:Fjord in Norway.jpg|N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord with sightseeing boat File:N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden fr\u00e5 Gudvangen.jpg|View from Gudvangen File:P1000566Gudvangen.JPG|Gudvangen ferry N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden mot Gudvangen.jpg|N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord File:N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord (6-2007).jpg|N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord File:Vesnorsk fjordlandskap Bakka.jpg|Plaquette at Bakka, signed by Queen Sonja of Norway June 10, 2006. ==References== ==External links== * *N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord Website *Official tourist information Category:Fjords of Vestland Category:World Heritage Sites in Norway Category:Aurland Category:Sognefjord ",
