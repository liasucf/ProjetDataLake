    "text": "This is a complete list of members of the United States Senate during the 114th United States Congress listed by seniority, from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017. In this Congress, Barbara Boxer (California) was the most senior junior senator and Deb Fischer (Nebraska) was the most junior senior senator. Sometimes a Senator is sworn in during the middle of the two-year Congress. This did not occur in this Congress. Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within his or her new incoming class), service as vice president, a House member, a cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state.A Chronological List of United States Senators 1789-Present, via www.senate.gov1971 U.S Census Report Contains 1970 Census results.1981 U.S Census Report Contains 1980 Census results.1991 U.S Census Report Contains 1990 Census results. ==U.S. Senate seniority list== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- valign=bottom !
