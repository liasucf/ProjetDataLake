    "text": "\"Bandy the Rodeo Clown\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artists Sanger D. Shafer and Lefty Frizzell, and made famous by Moe Bandy. It was released in June 1975 as the title track from his third album, and was his final single from GRC Records. According to AllMusic journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the song and its parent album began \"to hint at the good-natured persona that would dominate his Columbia Records.\" The song casts Bandy as himself in the title role, a rodeo clown who laughs through heartache and the physical pain of the job.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas, Bandy, the Rodeo Clown, AllMusic.
