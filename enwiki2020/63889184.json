The church was repaired in the 18th century and further changes took place in the 19th century. The south church porch was demolished in 1830, and during the same time the windows were replaced. Between 1849 and 1850 a north transept was added, followed in 1856\u201358 by a south transept. These additions were designed by Carl Georg Brunius. The weatherwane of the church carries the year 1891, when the church was repaired. A major restoration was carried out in 1978, when the Romanesque murals were uncovered and restored. ==Murals and furnishings== The apse of H\u00e4rsl\u00f6v Church contains fragmentary Romanesque murals from the second half of the 12th century.
