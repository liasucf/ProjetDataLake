    "text": "Libertad Lamarque (; 24 November 1908, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina \u2013 12 December 2000 in Mexico City, Mexico) was an Argentine actress and singer, one of the icons of the Golden Age of Argentine and Mexican cinema. She achieved fame throughout Latin America, and became known as \"La Novia de Am\u00e9rica\" (\"The Sweetheart of the Americas\"). By the time she died in 2000, she had appeared in 65 films (21 filmed in Argentina, 45 in Mexico and one in Spain) and six soap operas, had recorded over 800 songs and had made innumerable theatrical appearances. ==Biography== Libertad Lamarque was born in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Argentina to Gaudencio Lamarque (1874-1947), an Uruguayan of French descent, and a widow of Spanish origin, Josefa Bouza (1863-1932).Libertad Lamarque (Spanish) She was named Libertad (which means \"Liberty\") because at the time of her birth, her father, an anarchist, was imprisoned and pleading for release. ===Early career=== Libertad Lamarque and other actresses of her time at the Maipo Theater, 1933 At the age of 7, Lamarque won first prize in a stage competition, and participated with a group of street singers that made tours of nearby cities. In 1923, she appeared in her first professional role, the stage show Madre Tierra. Ad for the film \u00a1Tango! (1933) Her local acclaim convinced her parents that the family should relocate to Buenos Aires, where her chances of a career would be better. The family hung their hopes on a letter of introduction from a local journalist to the owner of the National Theatre, Pascual Carcavallo. It proved successful, as in 1926 Libertad was hired to sing in the choir and given a one-year contract. Her debut was in a play called La muchacha de Montmartre (The Girl from Montmartre) by Jos\u00e9 A. Sald\u00edas, where she sang as part of a trio with Olinda Boz\u00e1n and Antonia Volpe, to the guitar accompaniment of Rafael Iriarte. Within a couple of months, she had begun singing on Radio Prieto, and was signed for record production with Victor Records, which released her first album, Gaucho Sol, on 26 September 1926, as well as the single Chilenito. In 1929, she began working in Alberto Vaccarezza's, El conventillo de la Paloma (\"The Tenement of the Dove\"), which was about the life of a girl Doce Pesos, living in an immigrant tenement house. After two years and 1,000 performances, Lamarque quit the show to focus on her music career. She traveled through several provinces of Argentina and through neighboring Paraguay accompanied by three. In 1930, following this tour she entered a competition held at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, won first prize for her performances of the tangos \"La cumparsita\" and \"Tocaneando\", and earned the title \"Queen of Tango\". She capped this cycle by performing Oscar Straus's Tres valses (Three Waltzes), an adaptation of the operetta, with Chilean singer Choly Mur. Libertad Lamarque and others actors in the film Argentina Ay\u00fadame a vivir (1936). Lamarque in Adi\u00f3s, Argentina (1930) In the mid-1930s Lamarque was accompanied by a trio of musicians including bandoneon player H\u00e9ctor Mar\u00eda Artola, violinist Antonio Rodio, and pianist, Alfredo Malerba, who would become her second husband. She shone in works that were painful and romantic, such as En esta tarde gris (In this gray afternoon), Sombras, nada m\u00e1s (Shadows, nothing else), Tristezas de la calle Corrientes (Sorrows of Corrientes Street) or Caser\u00f3n de tejas (Mansion of Tiles), Canci\u00f3n desesperada (Desperate Song) and Sin palabras (Without words). Many of her best songs were by composer Enrique Santos Discepolo because they particularly suited her style. She filmed Adi\u00f3s, Argentina, which was directed by Italian Mario Parpagnoli in 1929, which was released the following year, and the first Argentine film with sound \u00a1Tango! in 1932, which resulted in her being the first singer to be recorded for a sound film in Argentina. Lamarque was a light soprano with a vocal range from approximately middle C (C4) to \"high A\" (A5). After \u00a1Tango! 's release in 1933, a string of films followed, including El alma del bandoneon (1935), Ay\u00fadame a vivir (1936), Besos brujos (1937), La ley que olvidaron (1937), Madreselva (1938), Puerta cerrada (1939), Caminito de la gloria (1939), La casa del recuerdo (1940), Cita en la frontera(1940), Una vez en la vida (1941), Yo conoc\u00ed a esa mujer (1942), En el viejo Buenos Aires (1942), Eclipse de sol (1942), El fin de la noche (1944), La cabalgata del circo (1945) and many more. ===Legendary rift with Eva Per\u00f3n=== Eva Per\u00f3n and Libertad Lamarque in film La cabalgata del circo (1945) Legend has it that Lamarque left Argentina because she had been blacklisted by its First Lady Eva Per\u00f3n. Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Frasier, authors of Evita: The Real Life of Eva Per\u00f3n, however, contend this is unlikely. They argue that Lamarque moved to Mexico, where she was adored by the audiences because Mexican cinema was in a better state during the 1940s and 1950s than Argentine cinema. The authors add that Lamarque traveled freely between Argentina and Mexico during the lifetime of Eva Per\u00f3n and beyond, which does not support the blacklisting legend. Lamarque denied during her lifetime certain aspects of the legend, especially the reports that she had slapped Eva on the set of La cabalgata del circo. In her 1986 autobiography, she flatly denied the allegations and explained that she was simply mortified by Eva's lack of discipline during production of the film. According to Lamarque, Eva refused to take her work seriously and always arrived late or stalled the filming for trivial or personal reasons. Complaints to either the producer or the director produced no result as they were giving Eva preferential treatment as the girlfriend of Juan Per\u00f3n. By 1946, Eva and Juan Per\u00f3n were ensconced in the Presidential Palace, rumors circulated that Evita had forbidden radio stations and film studios to play Lamarque's music or hire her, and Lamarque's films, music and publicity in Argentina seemed to have come to an end. ===Relocation to Mexico=== Poster for the film Cita en la frontera (1940) directed by Mario Soffici. Between January and February 1946, Lamarque appeared in her first tour of Cuba, which was listed as the artistic event of the season. On 7 January, she debuted in the Teatro Am\u00e9rica with a varied repertoire, but closed the show with \"Facundo\" by Cuban composer Eliseo Grenet to much applause. She performed shows daily, sometimes twice a day and on her final performance at Teatro Am\u00e9rica, 20 January, she held three performances. She performed at Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Santa Clara, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba; visited hospitals and schools; and her farewell performance at the Municipal Amphitheatre of Havana was said to have been attended by 20,000 fans. It was on this trip that the Cuban press first dubbed her America's Sweetheart. Just before the Cuban trip, Hollywood had offered Lamarque a seven-year contract but she refused it as she did not speak English and was afraid she would be taken advantage of. Despite her fears of working in the U.S., Lamarque sold out Carnegie Hall for a 1947 performance. When Mexico, on the other hand, offered her a picture deal to appear with legendary Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu\u00f1uel, she agreed. and moved to Mexico in 1946. The picture, Gran Casino, co-starring Jorge Negrete was a flop, but other roles followed, such as Soledad (1947), La dama del velo (1948), Huellas de un pasado (1950), Mujeres sin l\u00e1grimas (1951), Nunca es tarde para amar (1952), Ansiedad (1952), and Rostros olvidados (1952). Some of her best work during this period was in Otra primavera, filmed in 1949, La loca (1951) and Cuando me vaya (1953); for each of these she was nominated for a Best actress Ariel Award in 1951, 1953, and 1955, respectively. Lamarque during her prime Some of her last movies included Bodas de oro (1955), Amor de sombra (1959), Yo pecador (1959), Rosas blancas para mi hermana negra (1969), with Cuban singer Eusebia Cosme and her last two Argentine films, La sonrisa de mam\u00e1 (1972) and La mam\u00e1 de la novia (1978). But as she wound down her movie career, she began touring with music again. In the late 1950s, she did a concert tour with Puerto Rican singer Jes\u00fas Qui\u00f1ones Ledesma and worked in Chile, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and returned to Cuba to do theater and record several albums. She returned to Argentina after Evita's death and was the first person to bring a Spanish version of \"Hello Dolly\" to Latin audiences at a 1967 performance at the Teatro Nacional in Buenos Aires, which she also later performed in Mexico in 1968 staged by Manolo Fabreg\u00e1s. In 1982, she starred in the musical revue, Libertad Lamarque, \u00bfes una mujer de suerte? at the Teatro Lola Membrives in Buenos Aires. She wrote the script, which was adapted by Nicol\u00e1s Carreras under the musical direction of Oscar Cardozo Ocampo. In 1988, Lamarque participated in the season at Mar del Plata's Teatro Opera with the musical A todo tango II under the direction of Jos\u00e9 Col\u00e1ngelo. In the 1960s she appeared in several episodes of a television show called \"Saturday Circular\" with Nicholas Mancera and in 1961, she filmed As\u00ed era mi madre, her only Spanish film.

In 1985, she received the Konex Platinum Award for Best Tango Singer in Argentina. In 1988, she put her hand prints on the \"Walk of Fame of the Hermitage Hotel\".

She was appointed \"Illustrious citizen of the city of Buenos Aires\" in 1990 and on 15 November 1991, a few days before her birthday, the Municipal Council of Rosario granted her a similar distinction.
