On 18 September 2011, Baroness Stowell was appointed a Baroness-in-Waiting to the Queen, following the promotion of the former Lord-in-Waiting Lord Taylor of Holbeach (who became a junior minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). In 2013, Baroness Stowell with the guidance of Christopher Briggs was responsible for steering the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill for England and Wales through the House of Lords.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport selected Stowell to be the new chair of the Charity Commission for England and Wales. However in 2018 the parliamentary Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee at their interview of Stowell unanimously refused to endorse the appointment due to \"a complete lack of experience\" and a lack of \"any real insight, knowledge or vision\". In 2018, it was reported that the Charity Commission for England and Wales, of which Stowell is Chair, would question The Transformation Trust, a charity which Stowell was a trustee of, over staff payments. ==References== ==External links== *Debrett's People of Today |- |- Category:1967 births Category:BBC executives Category:Conservative Party (UK) Baronesses- and Lords-in-Waiting Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Conservative Party (UK) officials Category:Female life peers Category:Female members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:Living people Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People from Beeston, Nottinghamshire ",
