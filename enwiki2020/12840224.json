Already a self-taught guitarist, Di Piazza developed a distinctive, but unorthodox 'closed palm' technique of picking with the right hand thumb, index, and middle fingers, giving him a speed not often heard in electric bass players. A member of the John McLaughlin Trio\" from 1991 to 1992 along with Trilok Gurtu a world tour of 300 concerts and an album Que Alegria. He influenced numerous bass players in Europe and the USA such as Matthew Garrison, Adam Nitti, Lucas Pickford. In 2000, Di Piazza released the album Front Page (Sunnyside) with a group of the same name, consisting of Bir\u00e9li Lagr\u00e8ne on Guitar and Dennis Chambers on Drums. In 2001 the album was awarded the Victory Music Award for the year's best jazz CD. In 2005 and 2006 Di Piazza toured in R\u00e9union, Mauritius, Madagascar and 10 other countries in Africa, accompanied by Meddy Gerville - a pianist from Reunion, Jean-Marie Ecay on guitar, and drummer Horacio Hernandez. This tour led to a new CD called Jazz Amwin, which has been released independently. == External links == *GlobalBass.com archives - accessed on August 19th, 2007 == References == Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:French jazz bass guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:French people of Sicilian descent Category:Male jazz musicians Category:French male guitarists ",
