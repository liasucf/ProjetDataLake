His form soon attracted the attentions of bigger clubs in non-league football, with the youngster joining Telford United before the start of the 1997\u201398 season. He made only a handful of appearances at the Buck's Head, before leaving at the end of the season to move to America, where he took a break from football to study computer science at the Coastal Carolina University under a football scholarship. After a year in the States, he returned to the UK, continuing his computer science studies at the University of Wolverhampton. He continued to play football, turning out for the British Universities team for a spell. He returned to the non-league ranks with short spells at Rushall Olympic and Stourport Swifts, before signing for Southern League Premier Division side Worcester City on the eve of the 2002\u20132003 season.Worcester News: Charlton aiming to bring cheer to City Used mainly as a substitute, Charlton made only four starts at St. Georges Lane, before joining fellow Southern League side Halesowen Town in January 2003. His stay with the Yeltz was to be the longest of his career to date, as he became a popular figure at the Grove. He was named club captain the following season after their relegation to Southern League West, but fell out of favour at the start of the 2004\u20132005 season, and moved to newly promoted Conference North side Redditch United. He enjoyed two years of success at the Valley, making seventy appearances for United as they established themselves at step two in English non-league football. His form for Redditch had caught the eye of a number of clubs, but it was a surprise to all when it emerged that at 29 years old, Charlton was to be given his first chance of professional football at League Two Mansfield Town. He signed for the Stags in November 2006, but made only a handful of appearances as they only just avoided relegation to non-league football. Released at the end of the season, he moved back to the Bucks Head, to join newly promoted AFC Telford United. He became a popular figure in the 2007\u201308 season, as the Bucks immediately settled into their new surroundings of Conference North. He started the 2008\u201309 season suspended, and put himself further down the pecking order when he injured himself after dropping a beer barrel on his foot. After recovering, he was sent out on loan to local sides Shifnal Town and Stourbridge to gain match practice. The left-back left the Conference North side Redditch United in 2010 and signed with Corby Town.Corby Town Football Squad \u2013 Squad Asa Charlton (Corby Town) Playing Career His next move was to re-join former club Worcester City.
