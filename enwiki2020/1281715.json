    "text": "Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) is a public medical college and hospital located in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. It houses the most prestigious medical school as well as the largest tertiary care hospital in the country on one campus. This institution is regarded as the epitome of medical education in Bangladesh since its inception. Dhaka Medical College pioneered in almost every unique medical achievements of Bangladesh. The country's first ever autologous bone marrow transplant took place in its bone marrow transplant unit. ==History== Hospital Building ===Site during pre- college years=== The college's original building was built before the Partition of Bengal of 1905. As of 1904, the building was being used as the secretariat (headquarters) of the newly formed provinces of East Bengal and Assam. In 1921, it was turned over to the University of Dhaka, which was founded that year. A part of the huge building was used as the university's medical center, another part as the students' dormitory, and the rest as the office of the administrative wing of the Arts faculty. In 1939, the Dhaka university council requested British Government to establish a separate medical college in Dhaka. The proposal was postponed because of the onset of the Second World War. During World War II the medical center building became an American armed forces hospital. The Americans vacated the building at the end of the war. ===Establishment of the college=== In 1946, due to the partition of India, all the advanced students (From K-4 to K-1) as well as many lecturers and professors were transferred from Calcutta Medical College to start academic studies and maintain hospital facilities in the newly established Dhaka Medical College. Academic classes started on 10 July, which is celebrated as DMC Day. Major W. J. Virgin, the head of the committee formed to establish the Dhaka Medical College, was the first principal. In the beginning there were only four departments \u2013 medicine, surgery, gynecology and otolaryngology (ENT). Since the college did not initially have anatomy or physiology departments, the students at first attended those classes at Mitford Medical School (now the Sir Salimullah Medical College); but, after a month, Professor of Anatomy Pashupati Basu and Professor of Physiology Hiralal Saha joined the staff and their specialties were taught in ward no. 22 of the hospital. ===Expansion=== There was no lecture hall nor dissection gallery at first. These needs were met after the construction of new academic buildings in 1955. The college did not have any student housing. Male students were allowed to reside in the Dhaka University's student halls, but female students did not have the use of that facility. The college and hospital premises were expanded with temporary sheds, some of which were built for outdoor services of the hospital and some for student housing. New buildings for housing, college, and hospital were constructed in phases: a dormitory for girls in 1952, a dormitory for male students in 1954\u201355, a new complex of academic buildings in 1955, and a dormitory for internee doctors in 1974\u201375. A new academic and hospital building, adding 500 beds, Dhaka Medical College Hospital-2 (DMCH-2), was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 3 October 2013. === Historical controversies of K === Every student batch, or class, of Dhaka Medical College is tagged with the prefix K along with a number. The 1st year, the beginning batch of the college, was named K-5, likewise 2nd year as K-4, 3rd year as K-3, 4th year as K-2, and 5th year K-1. In 2020, DMC is hosting its 77th batch, hence branded as K-77. Many theories about the origin of the letter K exist, the most popular being that K stands for Kolkata, as many students of DMC's earlier batches migrated from Calcutta Medical College. Though Kolkata was officially known as Calcutta until 2001 but widely pronounced as Kolkata/Kolikata in Bengali. Another theory proposes that, as the college was the 11th medical school in Indian subcontinent, K, the 11th letter of alphabet, is used. ==Undergraduate course== A countrywide combined medical admission test for MBBS course is held every year under the supervision of DGHS. Students after passing Higher Secondary School Certificate or equivalent examinations with the required grades can apply for the test. In 2019, 216 general seats and 4 seats for freedom fighter quota were allocated for MBBS course in Dhaka medical college. The topper candidates, according to their preferences, get the opportunity to study at Dhaka Medical College. Foreign candidates from both SAARC and non-SAARC countries are selected by DGHS and MOHFW as per required qualifications. College runs 5-year MBBS course according to the curriculum developed by BMDC. A student studies Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Pharmacology, Microbiology, Forensic Medicine, Community Medicine, Medicine & allied subjects, Surgery & allied subjects and Gynecology & Obstetrics during the course period. The course is divided into 4 phases. Four professional examinations, one at the end of each phase, are held under University of Dhaka. After passing the fourth or final professional examination, a student is awarded with MBBS degree. Course curriculum follows percentage system grading. Pass mark for the college's internal as well as professional examinations is 60 percent. Student shall have to pass written (MCQ + SAQ + formative), oral, practical and clinical examinations separately. Students scoring 85 percent or above in a subject are awarded with honors. == Postgraduate courses == College offers MD, MS, Diploma, M. phil in 43 different subjects in affiliation with University of Dhaka and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. College also runs three fellowship courses of Bangladesh College of Physicians and Surgeons in different disciplines. ==Principals== Major William John Virgin, First principal of DMC {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:auto\" |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF; color:black;\" | Sl | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF; color:black;\" | Name | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF; color:black;\" | Duration in office |- |From |To |- |1.|| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Major William John Virgin || style=\"text- align:left;\" |01.07.1946 |14.08.1947 |- |2.|| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lt.

The barracks were formerly situated at the current location of the Shaheed Minar. There were about 20 tin shed barracks where the medical students resided. Because they were close to the Parliament of East Pakistan (presently Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University), the medical dormitories were chosen as the center of the student movement. In the early hours of 21 February 1952, all the students of Dhaka Medical College gathered in front of the medical college dormitories. In the afternoon the group headed for the parliament which was in session. No procession was allowed due to the imposition of Section 144 (a section of the penal code that prohibited unlawful assembly). The students decided to defy Section 144 at 4:00 PM at the historic Aam-tola (which was situated beside the present day Emergency gate). The police fired at the procession, resulting in the deaths of Salam, Barkat, Rafique, Jabbar and Shafiur. After sunset on 21 February, at the site of the deaths, the students of Dhaka Medical College decided to build a monument. Badrul Alam and Sayed Haider the then students of Dhaka Medical College planned and designed the structure. They worked continuously on 22 and 23 February and finished the construction, using bricks, gravel and cement reserved for the hospital. A paper with Shaheed Smritistambha( Monument in memory of the martyrs) written on it was attached on the monument. It was inaugurated by the father of Shofiur Rahman, a martyr of language movement. However, the monument was demolished by government forces on 26 February 1952. ===Liberation War, 1971=== Many staff and students took part in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, as fighters or in treating the injured.
