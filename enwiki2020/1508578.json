    "text": "Liam Joseph Fitzgerald (born 1 September 1949) is an Irish former Fianna F\u00e1il politician. Fitzgerald was born in Doon, County Limerick and educated at the Christian Brothers school in Doon, St Patrick's College, Dublin and University College Dublin. He worked as a teacher before becoming involved in politics. He was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1981 general election as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD for the Dublin North-East constituency. He lost his seat at the February 1982 election but regained it in the election that November. In 1991, he was a key member of the so-called \"gang of four\" that proposed a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach and leader of Fitzgerald's party, Charles Haughey (the other members of the group were Noel Dempsey, Se\u00e1n Power and M. J. Nolan). Haughey resigned in early 1992 and Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach, but Fitzgerald remained on the backbenches. He lost his D\u00e1il seat again at the 1997 general election, but was then elected to the 21st Seanad by the Labour Panel; he was re-elected in 2002 to the 22nd Seanad. Fitzgerald resigned the party whip on 27 March 2007, and stated his intention to run as an independent candidate in the next general election. It has been said that he did this as a response to the cancellation of the candidate selection convention in Dublin North-East. However, he did not stand at the 2007 general election. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Local councillors in Dublin (city) Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st Seanad Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:Politicians from County Limerick Category:Alumni of St Patrick's College, Dublin Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Irish schoolteachers Category:Fianna F\u00e1il senators ",
