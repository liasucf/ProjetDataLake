    "text": "Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate is an organic salt with the formula or , consisting of the triphenylmethyl cation and the hexafluorophosphate anion] . The cation is also called triphenylcarbenium, trityl cation, or tritylium.U. S. National Institutes of Health (2019) \"PubChem ID 2723954 - Triphenylcarbenium hexafluorophosphate\". Entry in NCBI's PubChem database, accessed on 2019-07-25. Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate is a brown powder that hydrolyzes readily to triphenylmethanol. It is used as a catalyst and reagent in organic syntheses. ==Preparation== Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate can be prepared by combining silver hexafluorophosphate with triphenylmethyl chloride: :AgPF6 \\+ (C6H5)3CCl \u2192 (C6H5)3CPF6 \\+ AgCl A second method involves protonolysis of generating triphenylmethanol : :HPF6 \\+ (C6H5)3COH \u2192 (C6H5)3CPF6 \\+ H2O ==Structure and reactions== Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate readily hydrolyzes, in a reaction that is the reverse of one of its syntheses: :(C6H5)3CPF6 \\+ H2O \u2192 (C6H5)3COH + HPF6 Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate has been used for abstracting hydride () from organic compounds. Treatment of metal-alkene and diene complexes one can generate allyl and pentadienyl complexes, respectively. Triphenylmethyl perchlorate is a common substitute for triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate. However, the perchlorate is not used as widely, because, like other organic perchlorates, it is potentially explosive. ==See also== * Triphenylmethyl radical * Triphenylmethane * Triphenylmethanol * Triphenylmethyl chloride ==References== Category:Aromatic compounds Category:Hexafluorophosphates Category:Carbocations Category:Phenyl compounds ",
