    "text": "The Akhand Keertanee Jathaa (AKJ) is a jatha (collective group) of Sikhism dedicated to the Sikh lifestyle. The Jathaa follows a strict discipline in keeping the Rehit of Guru Gobind Singh Jee. They also enjoy an active style of Keertan recited by Sikhs in a collective manner in front of Sree Guru Granth Sahib Jee. This style of Keertan is relatively simple, and the entire congregation devotionally participates in singing along. The Jatha\u2019s purpose is to provide Sikhs around the world with Sangat (companionship with enlightened souls), just like any other Jatha or group within the greater Khalsa Panth. The Jatha organizes Kirtan Smagams in dozens of cities around the world, spreading the transformative power of lovingly sung Gurbani to all. The Jatha also has a strong focus on the Sikh lifestyle or Sikh Rehit. The Jathaa follows a strict discipline in keeping the Rehit of Guru Gobind Singh Jee. They also enjoy an active style of Keertan recited by Sikhs in a collective manner in front of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. This style of Keertan is relatively simple, and the entire congregation devotionally participates in singing along. Bhai Sahib Bhai Randheer Singh Jee embodied this lifestyle of strict personal discipline. He wrote many articles on Gurbaanee and the Sikh Lifestyle. He was a dedicated Gursikh who fought injustice and always remained in Chardee Kalaa (high spirits). ==History== The Jatha (group) was started in the late 1800s, when Mata Gulab Kaur, a spiritually enlightened Gursikh woman asked Bhai Randhir Singh to re-invigorate the Khalsa Panth with Kirtan. ===Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhir Singh Ji=== Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhir Singh Ji Bhai Randhir Singh ji (1878\u20131961) was from Ludhiana. He opposed the British rule and was imprisoned by the British authorities in 1914 till 1931. Bhai Randhir Singh was given the title of \u201cBhai Sahib\u201d and the suffix \u201cJi\u201d from the Panth as he was honoured by all the 4 \u201cTakhts\u201d (5th Takhat was ordained later on) or supreme centres for Sikhs for committing his life for the sacrifice of the Panth and always propagating the true message of Gurmat and inspiring people to take Amrit. Bhai Randhir Singh and Bhai Veer Singh were the only Sikhs to receive this title in the 20th century. Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh ji was very prominent in the Panthik arena. There was wide recognition of his high Jeevan and Panthik Kurbani. Many of the jatha went to jail in the anti \u2013 British movement, and suffered a lot of torture. Bhai Sahib and Baba Attar Singh with many other Gursikhs had brought a lot of change in the Panth via the Gurdwara Sudhaar Movement. They worked under the banner of the Panch Khalsa Divan. ===Akhand Kirtani Jatha (AKJ)=== For a long time, the Jatha did not have an official name. In the past, it was often referred to as the \u201cWaheguru Singhs\u201d. In one such text, this was because people would say that everywhere these Gursikhs went, they would walk, talk, work, sleep, with Waheguru resounding around them. Other names for the Jatha have included the Nirban Kirtani Jatha and \u201cBhai Randhir Singh da Jatha\u201d. The name AKJ only became common when Bhai Randhir Singh started doing Kirtan in all of the historical Gurdwaras. It was when Bhai Sahib started doing his marathon non-stop kirtan sessions that the name Akhand Kirtani Jatha (non-stop kirtan group) became prominent and was used often by the SGPC officials and the historical Gurdwaras where they performed Kirtan. This was how the name Akhand Kirtani Jatha came into existence. Bhai Sahib never named the Jatha and only referred to it as \u2018the Jatha\u2019, a name commonly used in India, which means a group. The name was started by Parbandaks and managers of the Gurdwaras; later it got registered in the 1970s, as was the case with most panthic groups. Today it is a worldwide organization which spreads the message of Shabad Guru, and considers itself a part of the Khalsa Panth and not a separate entity. ==Beliefs== AKJ follows the rules (Panthic Rehit Maryada) set by SGPC. The Jatha fully align itself with Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib and the Khalsa Panth. Jatha views itself as being completely under the umbrella of Sri Akaal Takhat Sahib and the Khalsa Panth. > The four transgressions, which must be avoided are: (1) Dishonouring the > hair, (2) Eating Kuttha, (3) Intimate relationship with a person other than > one\u2019s spouse, and (4) Using tobacco (i.e. intoxicants). In addition to the Sikh Rehit Maryada, AKJ follows a stricter form of rehit which === Nitnem Banis === AKJ follows the Nitnem maryada followed by the Sikh panth. The 5 Banis recited every morning are the same Banis that are recited when preparing Amrit during Amrit ceremony. A Gurskh learns from the Amrit Sanchaar that the Banis being read there should be read every day so that the internal Amrit is experienced every day. The Nitnem banis read everyday by Gursikhs in AKJ are: # Japji Sahib # Jaap Sahib # Tav Prasad Savaiye # Chaupai Sahib # Anand Sahib # Rehraas Sahib # Kirtan Sohila In addition to the following banis, sikhs try to add as many banis as possible to their daily rehit. ===Vegetarianism=== Eating \"Kuttha\" meat is prohibited in Sikh Rehit Maryada. The Sikh Rehat Maryada and some Sikh scholars define Kutthaa as meat \"slaughtered in the Muslim way\" (Halaal meat).Punjabi-English Dictionary, Punjabi University, Dept. of Punjabi Lexicography, Published Dec. 1994. Kuttha: meat of animal or fowl slaughtered slowly as prescribed by Islamic law.Sikhism, A Complete Introduction, Dr. H.S.Singha & Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press - We must give the rationale behind prescribing jhatka meat as the approved food for the Sikhs. According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran - the kosher meat prepared by slowly severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. It is done to make slaughter a sacrifice to God and to expiate the sins of the slaughter. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non- Muslims. Accordingly, he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food. The Jatha believes that Kutthaa means \u201ckilled meat\u201d (i.e. killed in any way). Thus, the code of vegetarianism is followed by Akhand Kirtani Jatha. === Keski as Kakaar === According to the Panthic Sikh Rehit Maryada, published by the SGPC, the five K\u2019s are: > I. The Keshas (unshorn hair), II. The Kirpan {sheathed sword} (The length of > the sword to be worn is not prescribed., III. The Kachhehra (The Kachhehra > (drawers like garment) may be made from any cloth, but its legs should not > reach down to below the shins.), IV. The Kanga (comb), V. The Karha {steel > bracelet} (The Karha should be of pure steel.) The Jatha, believes Keski is Kakkaar, not Kesh. They base this on references in the historical text of \u201cGuru Kian Sakhian\u201d (also known as \u201cBhatt Vehee\u201d) and other Rehatnamas. Promoting the wearing of a Keski (turban) shows greater respect and reverence for the sacred hair. It also helps avoid the violation of damaging or dishonouring one's hair which is one of the 4 Bajjar Kurehits (cardinal sins), according to Sikh Rehit Maryada. === Raagmala === The Panthic Sikh Rehat Maryada states: > \"The reading of the whole Guru Granth Sahib (intermittent or non-stop) may > be concluded with the reading of Mundawani or the Rag Mala according to the > convention traditionally observed at the concerned place. (Since there is a > difference of opinion within the Panth on this issue, nobody should dare to > write or print a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib excluding the Rag Mala). > Thereafter, after reciting the Anand Sahib, the Ardas of the conclusion of > the reading should be offered and the sacred pudding (Karhah Prashad) > distributed.\" Raagmala is the title of a composition of twelve verses, running into sixty lines, appended to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji as a table or index of raags that appears after the \u201cMundaavni\u201d, i.e. the epilogue or \u201cclosing seal\u201d. The authorship of Raagmala has been the subject of controversy; more so the point of whether it should form part of the recitation of Gurbani in its entirety (i.e. being included in Sehaj Paath or Akhand Paath bhog/completion). The Jatha, do not believe in Raagmala being composed or written by the Guru Sahibs, but was added to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji at a later date. Consequently, they do not read Raagmala when concluding a Sehaj Paath or Akhand Paath. This does not violate Maryada. Till this date, Raagmala is not read at Sri Akaal Takht Sahib, Amritsar. ==Organisation== The current official AKJ leadership details are: ===Five Members Committee=== #Harbhajan Singh (Anandpur Saaheb) #Sahib Singh (Ludhiana) #Karam Singh (Tanda) #Hardial Singh (Gurdaspur) #Avtar Singh (Mallian) ===Jathedaar=== Bakhsheesh Singh (Phagwara) == References == == External links == *https://akj.org/ Category:Sikh groups and sects ",
