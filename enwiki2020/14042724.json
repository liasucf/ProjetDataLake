    "text": "The Church of the Holy Cross is a historic Anglican church at 335 North Kings Highway in Stateburg, South Carolina. Built in 1850-52 to a design by noted South Carolina architect Edward C. Jones, it is a notable example of rammed earth construction with relatively high style Gothic Revival styling. It was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture in 1973. In 2013, the Church of the Holy Cross disaffiliated with the Episcopal Church and realigned with the Anglican denomination. ==Description and history== The church stands on the east side of North Kings Highway, west of the city of Sumter. Its walls, constructed of yellow rammed earth, stand tall, and are covered in stucco, with buttressing at the corners and long sides of its cruciform plan. A tower stands attached to one end, and the steeply-pitched roof is finished in tile. Window and door openings are in the shape of Gothic arches. The church interior is painted gray in a manner resembling stone. The church was built in 1850-52 on land donated earlier by American Revolutionary War General Thomas Sumter. It was designed by Edward C. Jones, one of South Carolina's leading architects; a prolific designer, only a relatively small number of his works now survive. and Across the road from the church is Borough House Plantation, the home of Dr. William Wallace Anderson, chairman of the committee that built the church. In 1820, Dr. Anderson had built his own house of rammed earth on the plantation. With its additional rammed earth outbuildings, the plantation complex is also a National Historic Landmark, and both form part of the Stateburg Historic District. The Church of the Holy Cross is still an active Anglican parish in the Anglican Church in North America's Diocese of South Carolina. The church still has its original Erben pipe organ installed in 1851. An 18-month, $2.3 million restoration to repair extensive termite damage was completed late January 2010 under the then-rector the Rev. Fr. Thomas W. Allen.Restoration pictures, March through August 2009Restoration pictures, August 2009 through February 2010 In 2013, the church disaffiliated itself from the Protestant Episcopal Church and realigned with the Anglican denomination.
