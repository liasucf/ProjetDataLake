The championships were open to amateur men based in Europe and for the first time ever (in European championships), each country had one competitor only per weight division. The styles on offer were Full-Contact and Semi-Contact. By the end of the championships, West Germany had the largest haul of medals, with host nation Great Britain in second, and Italy in third place. The event was held at the Wembley Centre in London, England, UK. ==Men's Full-Contact Kickboxing== The Full-Contact category in London had seven weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, with all bouts fought under Full- Contact rules. More detail on Full-Contact's rules-set can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules have changed since 1980.
