    "text": "Asher Naim (December 28, 1929 \u2013 November 11, 2016) is an Israeli diplomat who has served in Israeli missions to the United States, Finland, Ethiopia, United Nations, and South Korea. Naim was Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991 and played a crucial role in the 1991 Operation Solomon which airlifted around 14,200 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in a single day. == Early life and education == Naim was born in Tripoli, Libya, and he moved to Israel with his family in 1944. He graduated from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and held a master's degree in Jurisprudence. == Career == Naim has served in Israel's Foreign Ministry from 1956 until his retirement in 1999. He started his career as a cultural and press Attach\u00e9 in Tokyo (1956 - 1960), where he had also taught Hebrew at Tokyo University. In 1960, he was sent to Kenya, which was then a British colony but in the process of gaining independence, in the hope of building diplomatic relations with Kenya once it became an independent state. While in Kenya, Naim worked closely with Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta, who later became the first president of Kenya, and paved the way to fruitful relations between Kenya and Israel. Naim later served in Washington D.C. from 1968 to 1973 as an assistant to Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin and then as the consul general of Israel in Philadelphia from 1976 to 1981. Later, Naim served as an Ambassador in Finland from 1988 to 1990, and then in Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991. After a brief stint at the United Nations, he completed his career as Ambassador to South Korea from 1992 to 1995. == Operation Solomon == In 1990, Ethiopia's long-lasting civil war came to an end, and the Mengistu government was about to be toppled. Israel was concerned for an ancient community of Jews (Beta Israel) who have been living in Ethiopia for three thousand years. which was the main reason that Naim was sent to Ethiopia. Naim was instrumental in the process of negotiating with Ethiopia's then President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Operation Solomon was launched on May 21, 1991. It involved 41 flights, 37 airplanes, lasted for 25 hours, and 14,200 Ethiopian Jews were taken to Israel. Because of Naim's crucial role in Operation Solomon, he was awarded the highest recognition by Israel's President Chaim Herzog. == Legacy == After evacuating thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel, absorbing the immigrants to the mainstream Israeli society became the greatest challenge. Although officially retired in 1999, Naim continued to draw support for Ethiopian Jews, the group of people that he had helped save. Naim, along with other mainly American philanthropists, founded a scholarship fund (Keren Hanan Aynor Foundation) to support young Ethiopians who lived in Israel and wished to attend college and graduate schools. ==Death== Asher Naim passed at his home in Jerusalem after a long illness on November 11, 2016. He is survived by his wife Hilda, his children Ronit Zohar, Ari Naim and Gideon Naim, as well as 7 grandchildren, and many siblings and extended family. == Books == *Saving the Lost Tribe: The Rescue and Redemption of the Ethiopian Jews, by Asher Naim, 2003 *Jaekob, the Dreamer, by Sylvia Rouss and Asher Naim, 2015 *Yosef's Dream, by Sylvia Rouss and Asher Naim, 2015 == See also == * Operation Solomon == References == Category:1929 births Category:Ambassadors of Israel to the United States Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of Israel to South Korea ",
