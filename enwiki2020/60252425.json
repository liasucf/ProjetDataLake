    "text": "The Faroe Islands defeated Austria 1\u20130 on 12 September 1990 in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying match at Landskrona IP in Landskrona, Sweden. The result is notable as one of the biggest shocks in football history, as the Faroe Islands were playing their first ever competitive match and had a team composed of amateur players, while Austria played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy less than three months earlier. ==Background== The Faroe Islands Football Association became a member of FIFA on 2 July 1988 and joined UEFA that year, on 18 April 1990. Austria, in turn, played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy less than three months earlier and were eliminated in the group stage. Because the Faroe Islands didn't have a suitable football stadium, their national team chose to play its matches in Sweden, using Landskrona IP as their home ground. ==Match== ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%;\" |- | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:40%;\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 ||Jens Martin Knudsen |- |RB ||5 ||Julian Hansen |- |CB ||4 ||Mikkjal Danielsen |- |CB ||2 ||J\u00f3annes Jakobsen (c) |- |LB ||3 ||Tummas Eli Hansen |- |RM ||6 ||Allan M\u00f8rk\u00f8re || |- |CM ||9 ||Abraham Hansen |- |CM ||10||K\u00e1ri Reynheim || |- |CM ||8 ||Jan Dam |- |LM ||7 ||Torkil Nielsen |- |CF ||11||Kurt M\u00f8rk\u00f8re || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| P\u00e1ll Gu\u00f0laugsson |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"| {| style=\"font- size:90%; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 ||Michael Konsel |- |CB ||3 ||Robert Pecl |- |CB ||5 ||Michael Streiter || |- |CB ||4 ||J\u00fcrgen Hartmann |- |RM ||2 ||Kurt Russ |- |CM ||6 ||Heinz Peischl |- |CM ||8 ||Manfred Linzmaier (c) |- |LM ||10||Andi Herzog || || |- |RW ||7 ||Gerhard Rodax |- |CF ||9 ||Toni Polster |- |LW ||11||Andreas Reisinger || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |MF ||14||Gerald Willfurth || || |- |FW ||15||Peter Pacult || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3|Josef Hickersberger |} |} {| style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\" | Assistant referees: Kjell Nordby (Norway) Roy Helge Olsen (Norway) Fourth official: Peter Mikkelsen (Denmark) |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *Maximum of two substitutions. |} ==Aftermath== Austria coach Josef Hickersberger resigned the day after the loss. In the return fixture, played on 22 April 1991 at Salzburg, Austria beat the Faroes 3\u20130. Neither team managed to win against the other opponents of the group and finished at the bottom, with Austria in 4th and the Faroe Islands in 5th. Hickersberger returned to coach the Austrian national team in 2006, quitting after UEFA Euro 2008, which Austria co-hosted with Switzerland. Curiously, the two teams were scheduled to play in October at T\u00f3rshavn for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. ==References== ==External links== * Full match on Kringvarp F\u00f8roya website * Video about the match on Visit Faroe Islands YouTube channel Category:UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Category:1990 in Faroe Islands football Category:1990\u201391 in Austrian football Category:UEFA European Championship matches Austria, 1990 Faroe Islands, 1990 Category:September 1990 sports events in Europe Category:Sport in Landskrona ",
