They played in the Thunder Bay Junior B Hockey League and were eligible to compete for the Keystone Cup, Junior B Championship of Western Canada. ==History== The First Nation Screaming Eagles joined the Thunder Bay Junior B Hockey League in 2010. In their first season, they finished fourth out of four teams in the Thunder Bay League and lost their semi-final against the eventual champion Thunder Bay Northern Hawks in 3-games-straight. On word that the league was expanding, the Eagles elected to fold after only one season instead of incurring more travel costs. ==Season- by-season standings== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" |Season ||GP || W || L || T || OTL || GF || GA || P || Results || Playoffs |- align=\"center\" |2010-11 ||30 ||4 ||22 ||3 ||- ||95 ||188 ||12 ||4th TBJBHL ||Lost Semi-final |} ==External links== *Screaming Eagles Site Category:2010 establishments in Ontario Category:2011 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Defunct Lakehead Junior Hockey League teams Category:Sport in Thunder Bay ",
