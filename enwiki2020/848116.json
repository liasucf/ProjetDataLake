    "text": "Phileas Fogg () is the protagonist in the 1872 Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days. An inspiration for the character was the real round-the- world travels of the American writer and adventurer William Perry Fogg.Stephen Kern, The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918: With a New Preface, Harvard University Press (2003) - Google Books pg. 212Joyce E. Chaplin, Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks (2012) - Google Books pg. 215 ==Fictional biography== Fogg makes a wager of \u00a320,000 (\u00a32 million in 2017) with members of London's Reform Club that he can circumnavigate the world in 80 days or less. He sets out with his French servant Jean Passepartout to win the wager, unaware that he is being followed by a detective named Fix, who suspects Fogg of having robbed the Bank of England. In the second half of the book Fix helps Fogg in order to get him back to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, where he will be under British jurisdiction and Fix can arrest him. While in India, Fogg saves a widowed princess, Aouda, from sati during her husband's funeral and she accompanies Fogg for the rest of his journey. Together, the trio have numerous exciting adventures which come to an abrupt end when he is arrested by Fix immediately upon their arrival back in England. Although Fogg is quickly exonerated of the crime, the delay caused by his false arrest appears to have cost him the wager. Soon, Fogg drew back his arm and punches Fix, while Passepartout cries, \"Well hit!\" Believing himself ruined, Fogg returns home to ponder his options. Seeing his despair, Aouda, who has grown to love him and who feels guilty that he might have won the wager if he had not delayed to rescue her, proposes to marry him to help him cope with a difficult future. At this selfless offer, Fogg's reserve finally breaks and he joyously accepts Aouda's proposal. As it turns out, Aouda's gesture actually does save the day because as a result, Passepartout discovers that Fogg has miscalculated their travel time. Fogg did not take into account that because they crossed the Pacific Ocean from west to east, they gained a day when they crossed the International Date Line, and they have not missed the deadline after all. The three hurry off to the Reform Club and arrive just in time for Fogg to win the wager. Fogg splits his profits with Passepartout and Fix, and marries Aouda. ==The Character== Fogg has a philosophy in life to never worry about things which are beyond his control but to leave no stone unturned if they are. He is a balanced fellow not just in his thought processes but also his physiognomy which is a true manifestation of his psychology. He is a man of regular and precise habits which may border eccentricity. He doesn't like to be drawn into useless confrontations as he believes them to be utterly dissipative akin to friction. He is quiet and reserved in his expressions but decisive in his actions. He likes to travel light and has good knowledge of geography. He is not immune to softer emotions like love. He has no moral compunctions about using money to grease the wheels yet he has his own high moral standards specific to his era. He is brave but not foolhardy and doesn't mind slipping into masterful inactivity when required. ==Other appearances== In Albert Robida's Voyages tries extraordinaires de Saturnin Farandoul (1879), Fogg appears in the narrative having gone on an attempt to travel the world again, this time in 77 days. He is portrayed as a serial savior of ladies, having over three hundred rescued women accompanying him on his travels, which have lasted well over three years by the time he is introduced. In Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's The Other Log of Phileas Fogg, he is said to be Eridanean, an Earth- born member of the more benevolent of two extraterrestrial factions attempting to control the Earth; Fogg is a member of Farmer's Wold Newton family. Fogg's adventures continue in Phileas Fogg and the War of Shadows and Phileas Fogg and the Heart of Orsra, both by Josh Reynolds, and in \"Being an Account of the Delay at Green River, Wyoming, of Phileas Fogg, World Traveler, or, The Masked Man Meets an English Gentleman\" by Win Scott Eckert. ==In other media== ===Film=== * Fogg was played by Conrad Veidt in the 1919 film adaptation of the book. * Fogg was played by David Niven in the 1956 film adaptation of the book. * In the 1963 movie The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze, Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe circle the globe with Phileas Fogg III. * Fogg was voiced by Simon Callow in the 1999 animated film adaptation of the book. * Fogg was referenced by Allan Quatermain in the 2003 film adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. * Fogg was played by Steve Coogan in the 2004 live action film adaptation by The Walt Disney Company. ===Television=== * In a television episode of Have Gun, Will Travel starring Richard Boone, Fogg was used in the episode \"Fogg Bound\" that first aired on 3 December 1960. * In the 1972 animated series, Fogg was voiced by Alastair Duncan.
