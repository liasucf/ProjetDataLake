    "text": "Australian Playhouse was an Australian anthology TV series featuring the work of Australian writers. It ran for two series. Among the featured productions were works by Tony Morphett, Pat Flower, and John Warwick. ==Background== ===Development=== In August 1965 Talbot Duckmanton of the ABC announced that the ABC would increase its production of local drama, including a show called Australian Playhouse. This would not necessary consist of Australian plays and be \"of an experimental nature\". The series was the idea of producer David Goddard, father of Liza. Goddard worked on the show for nine months before it aired. He says he knew of a TV station which claimed it was going to so a TV series and asked for scripts, then claimed the scripts were not of standard; Goddard says the station never put on staff, and actually had no intention of making the show. \"It was making a political gesture by saying it was trying to do something. It is absolutely scandalous that this sort of thing should have been going on here. And this is where the idea has been built up that there are no writers in Australia. As we shall prove, this is absolute rubbish.\" Goddard said \"There's a wealth of untouched and untapped gold in the Australian short story writer. The Australian is gifted with the ability to tell a story.\" He said the show \"will all be written by Australians and produced in Australa. And because they are written by Australians and aimed at television audiences primarily in Australia, they will reflect, comment on, or observe in a fictional way life in this country, as those writers see fit, know it, or have experienced it. In a word, it will be Australian drama.\" ===Season One=== In January 1966 Goddard announced that the ABC would made 39 episodes of 30 minutes each called Australian Playhouse. They would do 14 weeks \"in all moods\", then 12 \"equally Australian dramas on a central theme\", then 13 more. This would be in addition to the ABC's monthly dramas, and a comedy series. (The comedy series would be Nice and Jucy and Marcellus Jones. Series one ran from April 1966Article on first show The Age to early November 1966. In April 1966 Neil Hutchinson said \"most of us have heard or read claims that Australia lacks good writers but I think you will agree this series disproves the claims.\" According to Frank Roberts of The Bulletin, writing in May, the series \"has to be viewed as a promising nursery\". It is estimated eight to nine productions were written and filmed but not broadcast due to concerns about quality. In June 1966 The Sydney Morning Herald wrote the series demonstrated that there was a lack of creative talent in the country, particularly of writing. At the end of 1966 the Age TV critic felt the majority of plays did not deserve to appear on air. Val Marshall of the Sydney Morning Herald, reviewing the season for the year, said \"what came up didn't always justify the timeslot. Roughly 10 percent were excellent (with the biggest score of winners going to Pat Flower). Another 40 percent was fair average quality. The other half can be written off as good tries. Was the Playhouse series justified? In my view yes.\" It won a 1967 Logie for Contribution to the Industry.1967 Logie Award Winnershttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat;=19670608&id;=WNRYAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Y5MDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5641,1309134&hl;=en Goddard said \"We have plenty of scripts and the future of Playhouse appears good. If there were to be any changes for next year it would only be a change in the time spot - perhaps later in the evening. We have some brilliant plays but they are only suitable for adult viewing.\" In December 1966 the ABC reported it spent a million dollars on Australian drama since 1956. It said it produced 358 plays, 187 of which were written by Australians. Australian Playhouse cost a reported $55,000 for 37 plays. The season was later described as 50% drama, 25% comedy, 25% fantasy. ===Season 2=== The budget tripled for the second series. However it ran for a shorter time. The series started on June 12, 1967 in Melbourne and then broadcast in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and then New South Wales on 24 July. By June all the episodes had been filmed and work had started on the 1968 season. Pat Alexander, executive producer, said over 1,000 scripts had been submitted. \"The result has been much better material,\" said Alexander. Only two scripts were by writers from the previous season. Fifty percent of the plays were comedies, forty percent drama, and ten percent fantasy of experimental. (Another breakdown had it as 40% drama, 33% comedy, 27% comedy fantasy.) The Sydney Morning Herald called it \"an inconsistent thing but our own\". A Sunday issue of the same paper called the second series \"the biggest flop\" of the year. ==Episodes== ===Season 1=== *Ep 1 The Pigeon w: Peter Finnane d: Eric Taylor (18 April 1966) *Ep 2 - The Tape Recorder w: Pat Flower d: Henri Safran (25 April 1966) *Ep 3 - The Air-Conditioned Author w: Colin Free d: Henri Safran (2 May 1966) *Ep 4 - The Prowler w: Pat Flower d: Alan Burke (9 May 1966) *Ep 5 - No Dogs on Diamond Street w: Marion Ord d: Storry Walton (16 May 1966) *Ep 6 - Wall to Wall w: Anne Kinloch d: Eric Taylor (23 May 1966) *Ep 7 - Getting Along with the Government w: Colin Free d: Eric Taylor (30 May 1966) *Ep 8 - What About Next Year w: Richard Lane (6 June 1966) *Ep 9 - Antarctic Four w: Oriel Gray (13 June 1966) *Ep 10 - The Monkey Cage w: Ruth Fenner d: Storry Walton (20 June 1966) *Ep 11 - Anonymous w: Pat Flower (27 June 1966) *Ep 12 - The Parking Ticket (4 July 1966( *Ep 13 - Should the Woman Pay w: Monte Miller (11 July 1966) *Ep 14 - Marleen w: Pat Flower (18 July 1966) *Ep 15 - The Final Factor w: John Warwick (25 July 1966) *Ep 16 - Done Away With w: Pat Flower d: Henri Safran (1 August 1966) *Ep 17 - Blind Balance w: Monte Miller (8 August 1966) *Ep 18 - Haywire w: Creswick Jenkinson (15 August 1966) *Ep 19 - Watch It w: Richard Barry (22 August 1966) *Ep 20 - Ticket to Nowhere w: John Bragg (29 August 1966) *Ep 21 - The Voice w: Kenneth Hayles (5 September 1966) *Ep 22 - The Empty Day w: Pat Flower (12 September 1966) *Ep 23 - The Decision w: John Warwick (19 September 1966) *Ep 24 - The Lace Counter w: Pat Flower (26 September 1966) *Ep 25 - Objector w: Tony Morphett (3 October 1966) *Ep 26 - V.I.P.P. w: Pat Flower (10 October 1966) *Ep 27 - Across the Bridge w: Liane Keen (17 October 1966) *Ep 28 - Easy Terms w: Pat Flower (24 October 1966) *Ep 29 - The Small Wonder w: Jeff Underhill (31 October 1966) *Ep 30 - The Paradise Shanty w: Kevin McGrath (7 November 1966) ===Season 2=== *Ep 1 - A Touch of Gold w: Gwenda Painter (22 July 1967) *Ep 2 - Slow Poison w: Allan Trevor *Ep 3 - Casualty w: John Croyston *Ep 4 - Keep It Clean w: E.R.
