    "text": "Avadi () is a neighbourhood of Chennai, India. It became a new Municipal Corporation in the Chennai Metropolitan Area and became city corporation of Tamil Nadu in 2019. The neighbourhood lies to the west of Chennai, about west of Chennai Central Railway Station. It is part of Thiruvallur district and is surrounded by major defence establishments and is home to various universities and engineering colleges. The neighbourhood is served by Avadi Railway Station of the Chennai Suburban Railway. As of 2011, Avadi had a population of 345,996. It is home to the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF). It is one of the most populous and developed areas in Chennai. The lake in Avadi was known as Paaleripattu, which is now found only in very old land documents. ==Etymology== The exact origin of the name 'Avadi' is not known. One version has it that it is the combination of \"Aa\" (meaning cow) and \"Adi or gudi\" (meaning place in Tamil), indicating that the place had many cows. One of the more popular theories about the origin of the name is that it is an acronym for \"Armoured Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India\". However, this is most likely a backronym invented more recently. The entity \"Armoured Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India\" does not appear in any British records. Several British documents from the 19th century refer to the place as \"Avady\", which doesn't match the widely circulated acronym theory. The name Avadi (Avady) was already in use by 1856, when the first public railway was opened in the Madras Presidency. This predates the transfer of the Madras Presidency's arsenal from Fort St. George, India in the city of Madras, to Avadi, which was done sometime after 1870, which contradicts the popular acronym theory. ==Geography== Avadi is located at . It covers an area of and has an average elevation of . === Lake === A view of the Avadi lake Avadi has a lake called Paruthipattu Lake. Spread over 200 acres and in length, the lake is located away from the city, behind the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) and Thirumullaivoyal. It was once a source of water for farmland irrigation. The body of water attracts many birds throughout the year. However, in the recent decades it has lost most of its area to indiscriminate building and encroachment. The Paruthippattu lake area was renovated with a budget of 32 crores and converted into an eco-park that officially opened on 19 June 2019. The renovation added recreational facilities, a 3-km-long walking track, a central plaza and various greenery, while addressing the issues of encroachment and sewage pollution that had affected the once-neglected lake.https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/paruthipattu-lake-on-city- outskirts-to-get-eco-park-on-lines-of- chetpet/article25440136.ecehttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil- nadu/2019/jun/19/avadi-becomes-tns-15th-municipal- corporation-1992128.htmlhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eco-park- at-paruthipattu-lake-to-be-ready-by-month-end/article26525987.ece ==Waste management== The neighborhood generates about 150 metric tonnes of garbage daily.
