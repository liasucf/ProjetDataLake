The book, first published in 1814, was used by Charles Darwin in his scientific observations. Werner's Nomenclature can be viewed as a predecessor of modern named colour systems such as Pantone. The colours are illustrated and described, and examples shown of their use in ornithological plates in The Anatomy of Colour by Patrick Baty. == References == Category:Color Category:1814 non-fiction books Category:Books about color ",
