His early years were spent at the family home, then at 40 York Place.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1863-64 H. H. Littlejohn adopted unusual methods of study. This included mapping instances of typhoid across Edinburgh in 1891 in conjunction with the noted map-maker, J. G. Bartholomew. The purpose of this was to track down the source of the outbreak. This technique is now common practice in police techniques to observe patterns in pursuit of crime detection. The results, published in the Edinburgh Medical Journal in March 1891, proved the outbreak centred upon a property at Gardner's Crescent, in the west of the city, with almost all neighbouring houses becoming infected. He then tracked the original source to a batch of milk from one individual farm, tracked down all the shops that it supplied, and had all milk destroyed (compensating the shop-owners).Edinburgh: Mapping the City, Christopher Fleet and Daniel MacCannell In 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
