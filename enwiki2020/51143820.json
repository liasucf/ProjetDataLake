They opened up new job opportunities and possibilities for development linked to the enhancement of an important resource of the country, whilst reinforcing the conscience of a rich cultural identity opened to encounter and exchange with the cultures of the world. The museum was designed using local materials, techniques and labor thanks to an Italian architect Antonio Piva, lecturer in museography at the faculty of Architecture of the Politecnico of Milan and a UNESCO collaborator. Upon the opening of this museum to the public, it has been attracting a lot of visitors to Babungo village to see the sculptures. == Administration and politics == The ngumba is the strongest political institution in Babungo. It represents the executive power of the traditional government, which limits the power of the fon. The elder members of the ngumba also have an important role in the burial of the fon and in the enthronement of his successor. Thus the Babungo say that the ngumba is a kingmaker and that it is the father of fons.
