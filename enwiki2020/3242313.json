    "text": "Laurent Jean-Pierre Mbariko (January 19, 1925 \u2013 December 30, 1972), from the Kwilu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was a prominent Congolese politician who played a significant role in Congo's independence from Belgium. After elementary schooling in Catholic missionary schools, he followed a fast- track training for teachers. After teaching in the Kwilu, he moved to Leopoldville, the capital, in the late 1940s. He became a leader in the scouting movement, and later became involved in the struggle for independence. His name is among those Congolese leaders who compiled key documents laying out the aspiration for independence from Belgium in the late 1950s. ==Government work== At the first free elections in 1959 he was elected Senator on the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) list headed by Antoine Gizenga.Parti Solidaire Africain (P.S.A) Documents 1959\u20131960 \u2013 H.

It was his way of protesting against the undemocratic process. He exiled himself to his native Kwilu where he died of illness on December 30, 1972. His integrity and wisdom have since been revered in tribal music. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Kwilu Province Category:Belgian Congo people Category:People of the Congo Crisis Category:Parti Solidaire Africain politicians Category:Government ministers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ",
