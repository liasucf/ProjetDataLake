    "text": "The Torrey Lake Petroglyph District extends for about along Torrey Creek in Fremont County, Wyoming. The site includes about 175 petroglyphs, as well as eleven lithic scatters and a sheep trap. The petroglyphs are in the Interior Line Style, or Dinwoody style, consistent with other rock art in central Wyoming. Site investigations have uncovered a number of petroglyphs that had previously been hidden under lichen. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1993. ==References== ==External links== * Torrey Lake Petroglyph District at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office * Torrey Valley Petroglyph Recording Project at the American Rock Art Research Association Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fremont County, Wyoming Category:Shoshone National Forest Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming ",
