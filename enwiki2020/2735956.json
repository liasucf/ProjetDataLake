    "text": "Pur et dur (a common expression in French literally meaning \"pure and hard\") is a term used in Quebec politics to refer to hardliners of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the Quebec independence movement.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pur_et_dur It is most commonly used in the media, where it was popularized. It is also used to criticize some members of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Some within the party resent the use of the term by the media, but some have embraced it. It is similar to the term \"SNP fundamentalist\", used in Scottish politics for a faction of the Scottish National Party, another pro-independence party. Many of the first \"purs et durs\" came from the Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale who, through entryism, joined the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the early days of the 1960s. They are associated with strong opinions about independence (including the need to attain it quickly, the question of an eventual supranational union, or \"sovereignty-association\", and the question of the \"\u00e9tapisme\" approach) and language protection (see Charter of the French Language). Some also criticize the party for not being social democratic enough. These militants have famously made the leadership of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a test and daunting task. The media has tied the resignation of every former PQ leader except Jacques Parizeau to the disapproval of the \"pur et dur\", especially in the case of Pierre-Marc Johnson. Parizeau a former Premier of Quebec, has sometimes been portrayed as \"pur et dur.\" ==Examples== These are people having been portrayed by some as purs et durs, while this \"status\" is debatable. *Paul B\u00e9gin *Patrick Bourgeois *Pierre Bourgault *Andr\u00e9 Joli-Coeur *Robert Laplante *Denis Lazure *Jos\u00e9e Legault *Yves Michaud *Jacques Parizeau *Robin Philpot *Jean- Claude St-Andr\u00e9 *Pierre Falardeau Two notable exceptions are Guy Bertrand and Gilles Gr\u00e9goire. Both are founding members of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, but have (or had) come to be disowned by the purs et durs. Bertrand was called, by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, an \"ayatollah in bedroom slippers,\" mostly because of his vigorous attempts to get the PQ to declare unilateral independence, but later wrote that an \"intolerant, ethnocentric, egocentric\" Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nationalism has been the bane of Quebec and Canada. A skilled lawyer, he has taken his anti- separatism cause to court several times. Gr\u00e9goire was a founding member and elected to the National Assembly of Quebec twice but was cast out when he was convicted of having sex with minor girls and sentenced to jail. He died in 2006. ==See also== *Pure laine *Quebec sovereignty movement *Quebec nationalism *Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word) *SNP fundamentalist *Fundi - equivalent term in Green politics ==References== Category:Quebec sovereignty movement Category:Quebec political phrases Category:Political party factions in Canada ",
