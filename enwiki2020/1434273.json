    "text": "__NOTOC__ This is an almanac-like listing of major Jewish holidays from 2000 to 2050. All Jewish holidays begin at sunset on the evening before the date shown. On holidays marked \"*\", Jews are not permitted to work. Because the Hebrew calendar is governed by precise mathematical rules and no longer relies at all on observation, it is possible to state what day the holidays will fall on for any date in the foreseeable future. {| | style= \"padding:10px;\" | | style= \"padding:10px;\" | | style= \"padding:10px;\" | | width=\"50\" rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\" | |- | style=
