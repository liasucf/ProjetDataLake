    "text": "Little Haifa or New Preston St. (a tribute to Preston St., the original Jewish Enclave and home to two Jewish cemeteries in the Germantown neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky) are the two nicknames for a large Jewish neighborhood on Dutchman's Lane in Louisville, Kentucky. The small neighborhood is the center of Louisville's Jewish communities, especially the Orthodox Jewish community. Located between the Highlands and St. Matthews neighborhoods, Little Haifa/New Preston is located on Dutchman's Lane stretching from Abigail Drive through Almara Circle, Vivian Lane, and Woodluck Avenue. It is home to Louisville's Jewish Community Center, Shalom Towers (Assisted living residence for the elderly of Louisville's Jewish community), Jewish Family & Vocational Services, Anshei Sfard & The Chabad House (aka Chabad Kentucky [Louisville's only Orthodox synagogues with the Chabad House also serving as a community center for the Orthodox Jewish community, making up two out of six total synagogues and temples in the Louisville Metropolitan Area]). Additionally, it is in close proximity to Adath Jeshuran and Kenneseth Israel Synagogues (Louisville's two conservative synagogues located in the Highlands, while the Temple and Temple Shalom are farther in the east end of Louisville). Almara Circle, Vivian Lane, Woodluck Avenue serve as the residential zone for most Jewish homeowners in the area, while most Jewish renters are located in Dutchman's Lane and Abigail Drive. There are also several houses and apartment buildings owned by synagogues and/or members of the Jewish community, that are used as housing for elderly, disabled, and financially unstable community members. Due to the high concentration of Jewish residents in this 1/4 mile stretch of area, the neighborhood is a very tight knit community. == Sources == * http://www.jewishlouisville.org/tag/preston-street/ Category:Jewish communities in the United States Category:Jews and Judaism in Kentucky Category:Neighborhoods in Louisville, Kentucky Category:Orthodox Jewish communities ",
