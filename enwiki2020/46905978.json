At that time the city was part of Austria-Hungary and after part of Romania. ==History== The Sibiu Gymnastics Club was founded on 30 October 1862 and aimed at youth education. With a decree of 1865, school gymnastics was a compulsory subject, so that the Gymnastics Society Sibiu initially functioned almost exclusively as an academic club from that date. From about 1870 the fencing operations began and in 1891 the Gymnastics Society of Sibiu changed the named in Sibiu Men Turnverein (in German). From 1890 Turnfeste were organized regularly, their general interest led to the creation of a women's team in the girls' gymnastics in September 1896. In 1897, they return to the name of Hermannst\u00e4dter Turnverein (in German). In 1903 first tennis matches was carried out by the Gymnastics Society Sibiu.
