Located on the narrow strip of land between the lakes Ciri\u0161s and Egles, the present-day village is the result of merger of three settlements: Aglona, Somerseta and Jaunciems. The scenic beauty of the surrounding area attracts many visitors every summer. The nearby Sacrifice Island (), Devil's Lake (), and the Madelanu Castle Mound are among the most beautiful places in Latvia. The surrounding pine forests have suffered from excessive logging in recent years, significantly damaging their once pristine quality. Traditionally, many families from Russia spend their summers in countryside near Aglona. ==History== Aglona is famous in Latvia and beyond for its Basilica of the Assumption \u2014 the most important Catholic church in the country.
