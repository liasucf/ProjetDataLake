    "text": "Dynea Halt was a railway station in Rhydyfelin near Pontypridd, Wales. It was a small halt on the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway, and closed in 1956. ==History and description== Like the other halts on the line, Dynea opened in 1904 to cater for the local railmotor passenger services. In October 1908, the halt was badly damaged in a flood. An avalanche of water and rubble swept through the area before over-spilling into the Glamorganshire Canal. In 1924, the suffix 'halt' was added by the GWR. Dynea had ground-level platforms with partially-open wooden shelters inside wooden enclosures. The gates of these would be unlocked when a train arrived. The shelters do not appear in later photographs, probably removed at some date before the 1950s. In 1931, the GWR added a down siding some 300 yards from Dynea Halt, controlled by the Dynea signal box. At some later date, a ground frame was added to control it, but this development was short-lived, and the siding was gone by 1943.Hutton, J. The Newport Docks & Railway Company. Silver Link. 1996. p. 90 Dynea closed in 1956, along with all the remaining halts on the line. ==After closure== There are no traces remaining of the halt. The site is now part of the Nantgarw-Treforest cycle track. ==References== ==External links== *Railtour 1952 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1904 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1956 Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Disused railway stations in Rhondda Cynon Taf ",
