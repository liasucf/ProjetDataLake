    "text": "Parc de Montju\u00efc is the upper station of the Funicular de Montju\u00efc, which is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) as part of the Barcelona Metro. The station serves the hill of Montju\u00efc and the various sporting and other facilities there. The funicular accepts Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM) tickets, and the station therefore has ticket machines and barriers identical to those of all other Barcelona metro stations. The station has twin platforms, one on each side of the terminal track. Because of the gradient at the upper end of the funicular, the stations platforms are stepped, but disabled access is provided to the upper step of the platform. The funicular station is adjacent to the lower station of the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, a gondola lift that continues uphill to a terminal near the Montju\u00efc Castle on the summit of the hill. Whilst operated by the TMB, the cable car does not accept metro ticketing, and passengers must exit one station before entering the other. == Gallery == File:Funicular de Montju\u00efc - Estaci\u00f3 Miramar 2.JPG|The platforms looking uphill File:Funicular de Montju\u00efc - Estaci\u00f3 Miramar.JPG|The platforms looking downhill File:Barcelona Montj\u00fcic 105 (8252479904).jpg|Car in the station ==References== ==External links== * Category:Funicular de Montju\u00efc stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1928 Category:Transport in Sants-Montju\u00efc ",
