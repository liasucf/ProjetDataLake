    "text": "Mark Millar (; born 24 December 1969) is a Scottish comic book writer, known for his work on The Authority, the Ultimates, Marvel Knights Spider-Man, Ultimate Fantastic Four, Civil War, Kingsman: The Secret Service, Wanted, Chrononauts, Superior and Kick-Ass, the latter seven of which have been, or are planned to be, adapted into feature films. His DC Comics work includes Superman: Red Son. At Marvel Comics he created The Ultimates, selected by Time magazine as the comic book of the decade, and described by screenwriter Zak Penn as a major inspiration for The Avengers movie. Millar also created Wolverine: Old Man Logan and Civil War, two of Marvel's biggest-selling graphic novels; the Civil War crossover storyline was the basis for the Captain America: Civil War film and Old Man Logan was the inspiration for Fox's Logan film. Millar has been an executive producer on all of his films, and for four years worked as a creative consultant to Fox Studios on their Marvel slate of films. In 2017, Netflix bought Millar's comic line, Millarworld, which Millar and his wife Lucy will continue to run; publishing new comics and adapting them for other media. ==Early life== Millar was born 24 December 1969Brissenden, Rachelle (Editor) (May 2000). \"Voice of Authority\", The Authority, p 23. WildStorm/DC Comics (La Jolla, California). in Coatbridge, Scotland. His parents were also born in Coatbridge, and Millar spent the first half of his life in the town's Townhead area, attending St Ambrose High. He has four older brothers,\"The Third Degree: Mark Millar\". Jupiter's Legacy #1 (April 2013). p. 27 Image Comics. and one older sister, who are 22, 20, 18, 16 and 14 years older than him, respectively. His brother Bobby, who today works at a special needs school, introduced him to comics at age 4 while attending university by taking him to shops and purchasing them for him. Still learning to read, Millar's first comic was the seminal The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (1973), which featured the death of Gwen Stacy. He purchased a Superman comic that day as well. Black and white reprinted comics purchased by his brothers for him would follow, cementing his interest in the medium so much that Millar drew a spider web across his face with indelible marker that his parents were unable to scrub off in time for his First Communion photo a week later. Millar has named Alan Moore and Frank Miller as the two biggest influences on his career, characterizing them as \"my Mum and Dad.\" Other writers he names as influences include Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Warren Ellis and Garth Ennis. More recent writers that have impressed him include Jason Aaron and Scott Snyder. Millar's mother died of a heart attack at age 64, when Millar was 14, and his father died four years later, aged 65. Although Millar enjoyed drawing comics, he was not permitted to go to art school because his family frowned upon such endeavours as a waste of time for the academic Millar, who studied subjects like chemistry, physics and advanced maths. He initially planned to be a doctor, and subsequently decided that becoming an economist would be a viable alternate plan, but later decided that he \"couldn't quite hack it\" in that occupation. He attended Glasgow University to study politics and economics, but dropped out after his father's death left him without the money to pay his living expenses. ==Career== ===1980s\u20131990s work=== When Millar was 18, he interviewed writer Grant Morrison, who was doing his first major American work on Animal Man, for a fanzine. When he told Morrison that he wanted to be both a writer and an artist, Morrison suggested that he focus on one of those career paths, as it was very hard to be successful at both, which Millar cites as the best advice he has received. Millar's first job as a comic book writer came when he was still in high school, writing Trident's Saviour with Daniel Vallely providing art. Saviour combined elements of religion, satire and superhero action. During the 1990s, Millar worked on titles such as 2000 AD, Sonic the Comic and Crisis. In 1993, Millar, Grant Morrison and John Smith created a controversial eight-week run on 2000 AD called The Summer Offensive. It was during this run that Millar and Morrison wrote their first major story together, Big Dave. Millar's British work brought him to the attention of DC Comics, and in 1994 he started working on his first American comic, Swamp Thing. The first four issues of Millar's run were co-written by Grant Morrison, allowing Millar to settle into the title. Although his work brought some critical acclaim to the ailing title, the book's sales were still low enough to warrant cancellation by the publisher. From there, Millar spent time working on various DC titles, often co-writing with or under the patronage of Morrison as in the cases of his work on JLA, The Flash and Aztek: The Ultimate Man, and working on unsuccessful pitches for the publisher. ===Marvel and DC career=== Millar signing a copy of Superman: Red Son at Midtown Comics in Manhattan In 2000, Millar replaced Warren Ellis on The Authority for DC's Wildstorm imprint. Millar announced his resignation from DC in 2001, though his miniseries Superman: Red Son was printed in 2003.Cowsill, Alan \"2000s\" in Dolan, p. 309: \"Mark Millar was never a writer to shy away from a controversial topic or from taking a unique concept to its shocking conclusion. With Superman: Red Son, he did both by presenting Superman as a communist and giving the conclusion a surprise twist.\" In 2001, Millar launched Ultimate X-Men for Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel imprint. The following year he collaborated with illustrator Bryan Hitch on The Ultimates, the Ultimate imprint's equivalent of The Avengers.Manning \"2000s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 311: \"With Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate X-Men serving as two of Marvel's most consecutive best seller, it was only a matter of time before the decision was made to reinvent one of the most popular teams of heroes, the Avengers, into this fresh new universe. And writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch were up to the challenge.\" Millar's work on The Ultimates was later adapted into two Marvel Animated Features and the subsequent 2012 Hollywood box office smash Marvel's The Avengers.The Avengers In 2006, Millar, joined by artist Steve McNiven, began writing the Marvel miniseries Civil War a seven-issue limited series revolving around the passing of Superhuman Registration Act as a result of the death and destruction unintentionally caused by superheroes and turned Captain America and Iron Man onto opposing sides,Manning \"2000s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 332: \"Writer Mark Millar and artist Steve McNiven unleashed Civil War on the public, an epic seven-issue limited series thst sparked some of the most heated fan debate in the history of Marvel Comics.\" the book formed the basis for the film Captain America: Civil War. In 2009, Millar wrote the dystopian \"Old Man Logan\" storyline, which appeared in the Wolverine series, and was set in a possible future in which Wolverine, having been traumatized by his murder of the X-Men (an event prompted by Mysterio's illusions), became a recluse, after which the United States government collapsed, and the country fell under the control of various supervillain enclaves. Needing rent money for his family's farm, Wolverine comes out of retirement when called upon by Hawkeye. Millar and his Wanted collaborator J. G. Jones at the Big Apple Convention, 2 October 2010 === Millarworld === In 2004, Millar launched a creator-owned line called Millarworld that published independently owned comic-books, with ownership split 50/50 between Millar and the collaborating artist. The first book under the Millarworld brand was Wanted, which subsequently became a Hollywood film in 2008 starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. Millar created and wrote Kick-Ass in 2008, which was adapted into another Hollywood film for Millar in 2010. Other books published by Millarworld included Chosen, The Unfunnies, and War Heroes, which was distributed by different publishers. In 2010, Millar left his Marvel work-made-for-hire contract, committing full- time to Millarworld, creating and writing Nemesis (2010), Superior (2010), Super Crooks (2012), Kingsman: Secret Service (2012), Kick-Ass 2 (2012), Hit- Girl (2012), Kick-Ass 3 (2013), Jupiter's Legacy (2013), Jupiter's Circle (2015), Starlight (2014), MPH (2012), Huck (2015), Chrononauts (2015), Empress (2016), Reborn (2016). Millarworld enjoyed interest from Hollywood with Millar staying on as an executive producer on all adaptations. Nemesis was optioned by 20th Century Fox with Tony Scott attached to direct. Superior was optioned by Fox with Matthew Vaughn on a producer. Super Crooks and American Jesus were both optioned by Waypoint Entertainment. Kingsman: The Secret Service, starring Colin Firth, was released in 2014. Lorenzo DiBonaventura took Jupiter's Legacy and Jupiter's Circle under his wing and started development in 2016. On July 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given a series order for a television adaptation of Jupiter's Legacy. Starlight was optioned by 20th Century Fox. Huck was picked up by Jeff Robinov's Studio 8. Chrononauts is in development at Universal. Millarworld was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Netflix in August 2017, the first acquisition for Netflix and the third time in history, Millar noted, that a comic-book company has been purchased by a studio. Millar will also run Millarworld with his wife Lucy Millar, publishing new comics under the Netflix label, which will adapt them for film and television. Kick-Ass and Kingsman were not a part of the deal.Richwine, Lisa (August 7, 2017). \"Netflix buys comics publisher Millarworld to feed films and TV\". Reuters. ===Awards and accolades=== In August 2011, Millar appeared in his native Coatbridge to unveil a superhero- themed steel archway beside the Monkland Canal that was created by sculptor Andy Scott, with help from the students at his alma mater, St Ambrose High School. The six metre-high archway, which was inspired by Millar's work, depicts a superhero named Captain Coatbridge and two female superheroines, and was created as part of efforts to regenerate the canal. In June 2013, Millar was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to film and literature on the Queen's Honours Birthday list. ===Award nominations=== * 2000 Eisner Award for Best Title for a Younger Audience for Superman Adventures shared with Aluir Amancio, Terry Austin, and others. * 2000 Eisner Award for Best Writer for Superman Adventures * 2001 Eisner Award for Best Writer for The Authority and Ultimate X-Men * 2001 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story for The Authority #13\u201316 shared with Frank Quitely and Trevor Scott. * 2004 Eagle Award for Favourite Comics Writer.

The Herald (Glasgow). Retrieved December 3, 2018. Millar had previously made comments supportive of Scottish independence and stated \"after the Blair era I was tempted for a year or two,\" but has since expressed ambivalence towards independence and retreated from the idea by arguing that the economic costs could prove too great and that Scotland would not truly be independent if it rejoined the EU. He has also been critical the governing Scottish National Party's policies on both education and freedom of speech.https://twitter.com/mrmarkmillar/status/1087618279198347265https://twitter.com/mrmarkmillar/status/1260159250493472768https://twitter.com/mrmarkmillar/status/1292849686987116544 ==Bibliography== ===UK publishers=== ====Trident==== *Saviour #1\u20136 (with Daniel Vallely and Nigel Kitching, 1989\u20131990) ** Issues #1\u20135 collected as Saviour, Book One (tpb, 128 pages, 1990, ). *Trident #5: \"Saviour\" (with Nigel Kitching, 1990) *The Shadowmen #1\u20132 (with Andrew Hope, 1990) ====Fleetway==== *2000 AD: **Tharg's Future Shocks: *** \"The Foreign Model\" (with Dave D'Antiquis, in #643, 1989) *** \"Self Awareness\" (with Keith Page, in #648, 1989) *** \"Nightmare on Ses*me Street \" (with Brian Williamson, in #785, 1992) *** \"A Fete Worse Than Death\" (with Brian Williamson, in #786, 1992) **Silo (with Dave D'Antiquis, in #706\u2013711, 1990) **Judge Dredd: *** \"Christmas Is Cancelled\" (with Brett Ewins, in Winter Special '90, 1990) *** \"Happy Birthday Judge Dredd!\" (with Carl Critchlow, in #829, 1993) *** \"Great Brain Robbery\" (with Ron Smith, in #835\u2013836, 1993) *** \"Tough Justice\" (with Mick Austin, in #840, 1993) *** \"Down Among the Dead Men\" (with Brett Ewins, in #841, 1993) *** \"War Games\" (with Paul Marshall, in #854, 1993) *** \"Judge Tyrannosaur\" (with Ron Smith, in #855, 1993) *** \"Book of the Dead\" (with Grant Morrison and Dermot Power, in #859\u2013866, 1993) *** \"I Hate Christmas\" (with Carlos Ezquerra, in #867, 1993) *** \"Frankenstein Div \" (with Carlos Ezquerra, in #868\u2013871, 1994) *** \"Crime Prevention\" (with Nick Percival, in #872, 1994) *** \"Top Gun\" (with Ron Smith, in #879, 1994) *** \"Under Siege\" (with Paul Peart, in #880, 1994) *** \"Mr. Bennet Joins the Judges\" (with Peter Doherty, in Sci- Fi Special '94, 1994) *** \"Crusade\" (with Grant Morrison and Mick Austin, in #928\u2013937, 1995) *** \"Man Who Broke the Law\" (with Steve Yeowell, in #968\u2013969, 1995) *** \"The Big Hit\" (with Graham Stoddart, in #1029\u20131030, 1997) **Robo- Hunter: *** \"Sam Slade: Robo-Hunter\" (with Jose Casanovas, in #723\u2013734, 1991) *** \"Return of the Puppet Master\" (with Simon Jacob, in Sci-Fi Special '91, 1991) *** \"Killer Grannies\" (with Graham Higgins, in Yearbook '92, 1991) *** \"Escape from Bisleyland\" (with Anthony Williams, in #750\u2013759, 1991) *** \"Return to Verdus\" (with Jose Casanovas, in #792\u2013802, 1992) *** \"The Succubus\" (with Simon Jacob, in Yearbook '93, 1992) *** \"Aces of Slades\" (with Anthony Williams, in #813\u2013816, 1992\u20131993) *** \"Serial Stunners\" (with Jose Casanovas, in #819\u2013822, 1993) *** \"Keith the Killer Robot\" (with Ron Smith, in #825\u2013827, 1993) *** \"Revenge of Dr. Robotski\" (with Simon Jacob, in #881\u2013884, 1994) **Red Razors: *** Red Razors (tpb, 144 pages, 2004, ) collects: **** \"Red Razors\" (with Steve Yeowell, in Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 1 #8\u201315, 1991) **** \"The Hunt for Red Razors\" (with Nigel Dobbyn, in #908\u2013917, 1994) *** \"The Secret Origin of Comrade Ed\" (with Steve Yeowell, in Judge Dredd Mega-Special #5, 1992) *** \"Doctor's Orders\" (with Steve Yeowell, in Judge Dredd Yearbook '93, 1992) *** \"Rites of Passage\" (with Nigel Dobbyn, in #971, 1995) **Tales from Beyond Science (with Rian Hughes): *** Tales from Beyond Science (tpb, 88 pages, Image, 2012, ) includes: **** \"The Men in Red\" (in #774, 1992) **** \"Long Distance Calls\" (in #776, 1992) **** \"The Secret Month Under the Stairs\" (in Winter Special '92, 1992) **** \"The Man Who Created Space\" (in Sci-Fi Special '94, 1994) **The Spider: \"Vicious Games\" (with John Higgins and David Hine, in Action Special, 1992) **Rogue Trooper: *** \"House of Pain\" (with Brett Ewins and Jim McCarthy, in Sci-Fi Special '92, 1992) *** \"G.I.
