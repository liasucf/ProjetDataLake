    "text": "The 1965\u201366 NHL season was the 49th season of the National Hockey League. Six teams each played 70 games. The Montreal Canadiens won their second consecutive Stanley Cup as they defeated the Detroit Red Wings four games to two in the final series. ==League business== A new trophy was introduced for this season. Jack Adams won the first Lester Patrick Trophy for his contribution to hockey in the United States. February saw the momentous announcement that six conditional franchises had been awarded to Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, all to begin play in 1967. The St. Louis franchise was surprising, as no formal application from the city had been tendered. It was awarded to fulfill the wishes of James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, owners of the Chicago Black Hawks, who also owned the St. Louis Arena, which they wanted to sell. On the debit side, a strong bid from Vancouver was rejected, much to the anger of many Canadians and the protest of their Prime Minister Lester Pearson. A rumor was widely spread \u2014 fuelled by a corroborating statement from Leafs' general manager Punch Imlach that the Toronto and Montreal owners had vetoed the bid out of a dislike for sharing the proceeds from television broadcasts of the games. Vancouver would eventually get an NHL franchise in 1970. ===Rule changes=== The only significant rule change for this season was a requirement that the teams suit up two goaltenders for each game. ==Regular season== Among notable players to debut during this season were Ed Giacomin for the Rangers, Bill Goldsworthy for the Bruins, Ken Hodge for Chicago and Mike Walton for Toronto. In the meantime, however, the career of future Hockey Hall of Famer Ted Lindsay was over, as his request for reinstatement as an active player was vetoed by the Toronto ownership. Gordie Howe scored his 600th NHL goal in Montreal on November 27 in a 3\u20132 loss to the Canadiens to the cheers of the local fans. Among lesser milestones in the season were Frank Mahovlich's 250th goal and Johnny Bucyk's and Claude Provost's 200th. In an unusual incident, the Red Wings' jerseys were stolen from the visitors' dressing room in Montreal the night before a January game, and Detroit was compelled to play in the uniforms of their junior farm team in Hamilton, which were express shipped to Montreal in time for the match. James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks, died of a heart attack in late February. ===Final standings=== ==Playoffs== ===Playoff bracket=== ===Semifinals=== The second game of the semifinal series between Detroit and Chicago on April 10, was nationally televised in the United States.\"Red Wings Jar Black Hawks, 7\u20130.\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 1966 Apr 11. For the fourth straight year, it was Montreal vs. Toronto and Detroit vs. Chicago in the first round. The Canadiens were victorious over the Leafs in four straight games, while the Wings beat the Hawks in six. ====(1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (3) Toronto Maple Leafs==== ====(2) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (4) Detroit Red Wings==== Chicago held a record of 11\u20131\u20132 versus Detroit in the regular season. ===Stanley Cup Finals=== Behind the skilled goaltending of Roger Crozier, who had missed parts of the regular season with illness, the Red Wings won the first two games of the Finals. However, Crozier was injured in the fourth game and the Canadiens won the Cup four games to two. Roger Crozier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as a member of the losing team. ==Awards== Bobby Hull set a new record for goals in a season with 54 and a new record for points in a season with 97, earning him the Art Ross Trophy and his second straight Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player. No left-winger would pace the NHL in points again until Alexander Ovechkin in 2007\u201308. Jacques Laperriere of Montreal won the Norris Trophy as best defenceman. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" colspan=\"2\" | 1965\u201366 NHL awards |- |Prince of Wales Trophy: (Regular season champion) || Montreal Canadiens |- |Art Ross Trophy: (Top scorer) || Bobby Hull, Chicago Black Hawks |- |Calder Memorial Trophy: (Best first-year player) || Brit Selby, Toronto Maple Leafs |- |Conn Smythe Trophy: (Most valuable player, playoffs) || Roger Crozier, Detroit Red Wings |- |Hart Trophy: (Most valuable player, season) || Bobby Hull, Chicago Black Hawks |- |James Norris Memorial Trophy: (Best defenceman) || Jacques Laperriere, Montreal Canadiens |- |Lady Byng Memorial Trophy: (Excellence and sportsmanship) || Alex Delvecchio, Detroit Red Wings |- |Vezina Trophy: (Goaltender(s) of team with the best goals-against average) || Gump Worsley & Charlie Hodge, Montreal Canadiens |- |Lester Patrick Trophy: (Outstanding service to U.S. hockey) || J.
