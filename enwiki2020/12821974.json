He took initiatives to recover the land and establish a recreation-cum-botanical park named as 'Jaflong Green Park'. The first foundation stone for the thematic Green Park at Jaflong was laid by Laskar Muqsudur Rahman, Deputy Conservator of Forests in 2005 with the cooperation of local forest staffs led by Forest Ranger Mohammad Ali. Nonetheless, at the inception it was a challenging task due to local conflicts and procedural constraints. The forestation program in Jaflong Green Park has been started under supervision of the joint forces, Jaflong Foundation and Forest Department. They have jointly taken up the forestation program with about 100 hectares of grabbed land. Under the forestation program, various types of trees, including hybrid Akash-moni, are being planted in the park to maintain ecological balance. thumb ==Gallery== Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (19).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (18).JPG|Boats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (16).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (15).JPG|Stone Collecting Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (12).JPG|Boats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (11).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (7).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|Boats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (21).JPG|Spring on the way to Jaflong Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (8).JPG|Way to Jaflong Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (5).JPG|Quern stones for sale in Jafflong Image:Tea Garden in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 05.JPG|Tea Garden at Jaflong Image:Boats in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 33.JPG|Boats Image:House of Khasia Tribe in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 07.JPG|Houses of Khasia Tribe ==See also== *Jaintia Rajbari ==References== ==External links== * Biodiversity of Jaflong * Jubilant at Jaflong.
