    "text": "SpinLaunch is a spaceflight technology development company working on mass accelerator technology to move payloads to space. As of January 2020, the company has raised in funding, with investors including Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures, Airbus Ventures, Catapult Ventures, Lauder Partners, John Doerr and Byers Family. == History == SpinLaunch was founded in 2014 by Jonathan Yaney in Sunnyvale, California. The company's current headquarters are in Long Beach, California. In 2020, SpinLaunch continues development of its 140,000 square-foot (13,000 sq. meter) corporate headquarters in Long Beach, and of its flight test facility at Spaceport America in New Mexico (leased in 2019). == Technology == SpinLaunch is developing a kinetic energy space launch system that reduces dependency on traditional chemical rockets, with the goal of significantly lowering the cost of access to space while increasing the frequency of launch. The technology uses a centrifuge to store energy and will then rapidly transfer that energy into a catapult to send a payload to space at up to . If successful, the acceleration concept is projected to be both lower cost and to use much less power, with the price of a single space launch reduced to under . The speed required to maintain Low Earth orbit is . == See also == * Launch service provider * Made In Space, Inc. * Outline of space technology * Reusable launch system * Spaceplane * SpaceX == References == Category:Aerospace companies Category:Aerospace companies of the United States Category:Private spaceflight companies Category:Technology companies established in 2014 ",
