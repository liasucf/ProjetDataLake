The Andean Region is one of the 10 administrative regions in which Venezuela was divided for its development plans en 1818 ==Description== The region is composed by the states of M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira, Trujillo and Barinas; and the region is located straddling the Andes Mountain Range. Except for the people of the Llanos in Eastern Barinas, natives from this region are usually referred to as \"gochos\". It has a total population of 3,607,720 and a density of 39,84 people per square kilometer. The Andean region makes up a mountain- like system with moors, lagoons, valleys, towns and many churches, and within these places it is possible to experience a wide variety of weather, like: mild, gelid, dry, humid and warm weather. In its total area of 90.552 km2; savannah landscapes, rain forests, gelid desert zones with desert-like vegetation and moors of perpetual snow can be seen. This region is known for having significantly more tempered weather than the rest of the country. The largest city in this region is San Crist\u00f3bal in T\u00e1chira State. Its maximum elevation sits at 4,978 metres above sea level, and the minimum at the mean sea level. Its major natural attractions are the moors and the high mountains. Actually, the Venezuelan Andean region has the M\u00e9rida state in it, which has the highest elevation in the country at 4,978 metres with the Bol\u00edvar Mountain. ==Economy== Economical activities in the region concentrate farming and many animal, coffee and fish production, as well as tourism and handcrafts. The ULA is the largest university in the Venezuelan Andes and it has campuses in the three major Andean states: M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira and Trujillo. For commercial trade, the region has a fluvial exit through Lake Maracaibo using the port of La Ceiba in the Trujillo state. However, its major linking with other foreign countries happens in the international boundary of T\u00e1chira with the Republic of Colombia through the customs of San Antonio and Ure\u00f1a, both of them Tachiran locations. ==Gallery== Nevada en el p\u00e1ramo meride\u00f1o.jpg|Snow on the road to the village of Pi\u00f1ando, M\u00e9rida State Abismos del tama.jpg|El Tam\u00e1 National Park, T\u00e1chira State Fauna de Los Andes venezolanos.JPG| Fauna of the Venezuelan Andes LA LAGUNA VICTORIA.JPG|La Victoria Lagoon El Pico Bol\u00edvar.jpg|Bolivar Peak == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * Category:Regions of Venezuela ",
