The development of that region remained stagnant until 1923, when the chemical company L. Queiroz & Cia obtained lands in the city and built a factory next to the railway and the station, leading new residents to the location, known as V\u00e1rzea, district of Jundia\u00ed. In 1954, the district was briefly renamed to Secundino Veiga, as the station. In the following decades, V\u00e1rzea Paulista was emancipated and the station is transferred from federal to state administration. Currently, the station attends to the CPTM trains with the name of V\u00e1rzea Paulista. On November 2011, in the 120th anniversary of the station, a set of buildings was certified as historical site by the CONDEPHAAT. CPTM hired a project of a new building for the station, similar to the current one, but there is no deadline for the start of the construction, budgeted at R$ 40,000,000 (US$ ). ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1891 ",
