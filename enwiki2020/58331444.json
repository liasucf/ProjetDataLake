Along with Jean- Baptiste Coclers, Paul-Joseph Delcloche, Nicolas de Fassin, L\u00e9onard Defrance and Pierre-Michel de Lovinfosse, he was one of the most important Baroque painters active in the Principality of Li\u00e8ge. ==Life== Nothing is known of his youth except that he was an apprentice to Englebert Fisen, another painter in the city. He seems to have then moved to Paris, where he studied under the portraitist Nicolas de Largillierre. After his stay in France, he moved on to Rome, where he worked in Agostino Masucci's studio. He returned to the Principality sometime before 1708. There he gained several commissions, including the decoration of the h\u00f4tels de ville in Maastricht and Li\u00e8ge. He only definitively moved back to the city of Li\u00e8ge itself around 1719. He also worked for several noble families, particularly the Oultremont family. Eleven paintings by him survive in the ch\u00e2teau de Warfus\u00e9e, including three of the lord and seven portraits of members of the Oultremont family. He was also commissioned by several churches in and around the city. His Saint Benedict Taken Up To Heaven for St James's Church, Li\u00e8ge is considered his masterpiece. Plumier also produced the high altarpiece for Li\u00e8ge's churches of Saint- Remacle (Descent from the Cross) and Sainte-Catherine (Martyrdom of St Catherine)--the latter sagged and tore in July 2018 and is being restored in situ. Plumier had two sons, who both also became painters. Jacques-Th\u00e9odore (Li\u00e8ge, 1702-1766), painted Baptism of Clovis as the high altarpiece for the church of Saint-R\u00e9my in Huy. Philippe-Joseph-Cl\u00e9ment (Li\u00e8ge, 1718-?) is recorded in Rome between 1739 and 1743 and a beneficiary of the fondation Darchis in the studio of Agostino Masucci. Plumier himself died in his home city and is buried in the church of Saint-Nicolas Au-Trez, whilst the city's Rue Plumier is named after him. == Paintings == ===Religious works=== === Oultremont portraits === * Portrait of Jeanne-Olympe, countess of Oultremont, chanoinesse d'Andenne, oil on canvas, 75 \u00d7 60 cm, ch\u00e2teau de Warfus\u00e9e * Portrait of Jean-Baptiste d'Oultremont, mayor of Li\u00e8ge and bailiff of Moha, oil on canvas, 95 \u00d7 73 cm, 1714, ch\u00e2teau de Warfus\u00e9e * Portrait of Jean- Baptiste d'Oultremont in armour, oil on canvas, 84 \u00d7 65 cm, ch\u00e2teau de Warfus\u00e9e ===Other portraits=== * Portrait of Prince William of Hesse, oil on canvas, 1720, mus\u00e9e d'Ansembourg * Portrait of P.
