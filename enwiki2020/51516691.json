The institution is housed in three branches: MS1, MS2 and Herbst Palace Museum (Polish: Muzeum Pa\u0142ac Herbsta). Established in 1930, it is one of the oldest existing and active museums to collect avant-garde art. In 1998 Muzeum Sztuki in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was entered into the Polish National Register of Museums under number 53. == Mission == Muzeum Sztuki in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is primarily focused on studying and displaying the collection of 20th and 21st century art in a variety of contexts, as well as on providing progressive artistic interventions and enhancing the role of art as element of social life, e.g., through educational activities. Its programme coincides with avant-garde project worked out at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s by the \u201ca.r.\u201d group or, more precisely, by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski, Katarzyna Kobro and Henryk Sta\u017cewski) and with the idea developed by Ryszard Stanis\u0142awski (Muzeum's director in the years 1966\u20131992) of a \u201cmuseum as a critical instrument\u201d. These ideas are further expanded in the assumption, according to which a museum is capable of re-defining and updating notions pertaining to art and culture and establishing social relations with the involvement of art. Through exhibition, research, educational and publishing programme, the Muzeum strives to practice the idea of art as a way to experience, feel and understand the reality, which was a part of avant-garde dream of creative life available to all.Przemieszczenia. Kolekcja Sztuki XX i XXI wieku, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a 2010 == History of the collection == === 1920s \u2013 the \"a.r\" collection === Muzeum Sztuki was established as a result of reorganisation of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a museums in 1930. The core of its collection is based on works of modern art collected in Poland and abroad by \u201ca.r.\u201d group in the period 1929\u20131932 and supplemented until 1938. The initiator and the main driving force behind the action of collecting the donations from artists was a painter and art theoretician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski, actively supported by Katarzyna Kobro \u2013 a sculptor, Henryk Sta\u017cewski \u2013 painter, as well as Jan Brz\u0119kowski and Julian Przybo\u015b \u2013 poets. Theo van Doesburg, Counter-composition XV, collection of the Museum of Art in \u0141\u00f3d\u017aThe Collection in its ideological dimension reflects Strzemi\u0144ski's artistic preferences, although its final shape was the product of the activities of many people, including Henryk Sta\u017cewski, Hans Arp and Michel Seuphor. It presents an overview of avant-garde strands and tendencies of the late 1920s and includes masterpieces of Abstractionists, such as Hans Arp and SophieTaeuber-Arp, Theo van Doesburg, Jean Gorin, Jean Helion, Vilmos Huszar, Henryk Sta\u017cewski or Georges Vantongerloo. The collection also includes artworks of artists representing Cubism (e.g., Fernand L\u00e9ger, Louis Marcoussis), Futurism (Enrico Prampolini), Dada (Kurt Schwitters), Surrealism (Max Ernst, Kurt Seligmann), Formism (e.g., Leon Chwistek, Tytus Czy\u017cewski), \u201cpure form\u201d (Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz) or Unism (W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski).Korespondencje Grupy \"a.r\" [in:] Korespondencje. sztuka Nowoczesna i Uniwersalizm, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a 2012 The collection was initiated by the artists and took shape as a result of their solidarity-based international initiative to donate works against any artistic divisions. === 1930s === Karol Hiller, Board with Spiral Originally, the museum was housed on the first floor of the former town hall in Plac Wolno\u015bci 1 and its full name read \u201cThe J. and K. Bartoszewicz Municipal Museum of History and Art\u201d (named after Kazimierz Bartoszewicz, who donated his family collection of art to the city in the period 1928\u20131930). The first exhibition opened on 13 April 1930 and this date is considered to mark the beginnings of what is today Muzeum Sztuki in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Avant-garde art from the collection of \"a.r\" group was made available to the public on 15 February 1931. In 1935 Dr. Marian Minich was appointed the director of the museum and already in the initial years he expanded the collection with works that have complemented the picture of Polish modern art with Polish Formists, the Lviv group of surrealists Artes, and representative works of Jankiel Adler and Karol Hiller. Immediately after World War II, Muzeum Sztuki acquired paintings of Alexej Jawlensky. Soon, the museum was transferred to one of the palaces of the Pozna\u0144ski family, in Wi\u0119ckowskiego 36, which since 1948 has been one of its locations. Marian Minich was re- nominated as a director. It was he who adapted rooms in the palace to the needs of the museum and invited W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski to cooperate, which resulted in the \u201cNeoplastic Room\u201d being added to the exhibition space. The collection of contemporary art was expanded with, inter alia, works by Jonasz Stern, Jerzy Nowosielski, and Alina Szapocznikow. === Ryszard Stanis\u0142awski and the Museum of Art in the 1950s === Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka, \u015aw. Wojciech In 1950 the museum changed its name to Muzeum Sztuki (Museum of Art) in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The second director of the museum became Ryszard Stanis\u0142awski, who headed the institution in the years 1966\u20131991. His goal was to expand the international collection of modern and contemporary art. In his museum practice he accentuated the pivotal role of the \u201cmuseum as a critical instrument\u201d and preferred focusing the collection on phenomena that were perceived as open, creative and authentic. Stanis\u0142awski's efforts led to the acquisition of the first painting from Roman Opa\u0142ka series of \u201ccounted\u201d paintings (others were to follow), the collection of early works of Krzysztof Wodiczko, Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka, and representatives of Warsztat Form Filmowej [Film Form Workshop]. Muzeum also received a collection of works by Czech artists acquired at the end of the Prague Spring (e.g. Ji\u0159\u00ed Kol\u00e1\u0159). Mateusz Grabowski, owner of an avant-garde gallery in London, donated artworks representing British Pop Art and Op Art (e.g. Derek Boshier, Bridget Riley, and Pauline Boty). American artists (e.g. Sam Francis, Lawrence Weiner, Barbara Kasten, and Chris Burden) bestowed their works in exchange for artworks of Polish artists. The collection of works from the first Construction in Process [Polish: Konstrukcja w Procesie] festival donated by \u201cSolidarity\u201d (e.g. Peter Downsbrough, Dan Graham, and Richard Nonas) enriched the representation of minimal art. In a symbolic gesture of solidarity with Polish society, Joseph Beuys donated ca. 300 artworks from his archivesKolekcja Sztuki XX wieku w Muzeum Sztuki w \u0141odzi, Warszawa 1991 within the framework of \u201cPolentransport 1981\u201d. Insufficient exhibition space was a permanent problem of the Muzeum. In the early 1970s a tender was advertised for the construction of a new building for the museum but the project has never been successfully accomplished due to the economic crisis. In 1973 the museum acquired an industrialist's mansion Edward Herbst Palace in Ksi\u0119\u017cy M\u0142yn [Priest's Mill]. Prospects of having a building that could meet exhibition requirements of avant-garde art became real with plans to develop the Manufaktura Shopping and Entertainment Centre in the former Izrael Pozna\u0144ski factory. === The MS2 branch === Atlas of modernity permanent exhibition at ms2 branch In 2006 Jaros\u0142aw Suchan was appointed the director of the museum and he has been holding the post ever since. Funds acquired from the European Union (under the Integrated Regional Development Operational Programme), the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, Voivodeship Office, and the Marshal Office in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were used to regenerate and modernise the former spinning mill in the factory of Izrael Pozna\u0144ski. In the autumn 2008 it became a new location of Muzeum Sztuki known as ms2 offering the space of 3000 m\u00b2, which houses the Collection of the 20th and 21st Century Art; further 600 m\u00b2 are dedicated to temporary exhibitions. The collection is exhibited in a way that departs from both the chronological arrangement of works of art and the idea of a \u2018permanent exhibition\u2019. New exhibition projects, whose aim is to uncover the potential of the collection anew, are underway within the framework of \u201cworks on the collection\u201d. According to the programme: avant-garde is not treated as a closed chapter that belongs to the past but as a set of ideas, which may still be meaningful to a contemporary viewer. Muzeum Sztuki introduces the audience to contemporary and avant-garde art in locations at ms2 and ms1. In the years 2011-2013 exhibition space in the building in Wi\u0119ckowskiego was refurbished. Edward Herbst villa that holds Old Masters Collection was also renovated in 2013. == Muzeum\u2019s Locations == Neoplastic Room, ms1 branch ms1, Wi\u0119ckowskiego 36 (Maurycy Pozna\u0144ski palace) \u2013 with Neoplastic Room designed by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Strzemi\u0144ski, which was the core of the exposition of \u201ca.r.\u201d group International Collection of Modern Art. In 2008 the collection moved to the premises of ms2, while the Neoplastic Room itself was left in its original place and the space around it is used to display works by contemporary artists, who make references to the Constructivism legacy within the project \u201cNeoplastic Room Open Composition\u201d. In ms1 at two floors of exhibition space we can find temporary exhibitions that show interesting phenomena in contemporary art. The garden in the backyard is used for open air events, such as film shows and concerts. The building houses also a coffee shop and a library open to all visitors. ms2, Ogrodowa 19 (building of the former spinning mill of Izrael Pozna\u0144ski factory) \u2013 facilities used for experimental interventions with the Collection of 20th and 21st century. The Museum's collection is organised around themes that exhibition curators consider relevant to modern audience. Space at the ground floor is used for temporary exhibitions that tackle mainly the issues connected with the avant- garde legacy. In the building there are rooms for workshops and other educational activities, as well as a multi-media room, which hosts, inter alia, lectures and film shows. There is also a coffee shop \u201cAwangarda\u201d and a bookshop selling books on art. Herbst Villa, Prz\u0119dzalniana 72 (Edward Herbst palace and garden complex) \u2013 a refurbished mansion formerly owned by a family of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a industrialists has become the exhibition space for old masters works (mainly those of the 19th century), presentation of palace interiors from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and the overview of the history of the Herbst family of industrial tycoons. == Collections of 20th and 21st Century Art == The collection includes paintings, sculptures and spatial objects, drawings, photographs, video, and installations. It is the largest and the oldest museum collection of modern art in this part of Europe.
