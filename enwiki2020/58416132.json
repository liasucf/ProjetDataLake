    "text": "TV advertisements by country refers to how television advertisements vary in different countries and regions. ==Americas== ===Argentina=== Commercial advertising in Argentine television (including cable channels operated from the country itself) is limited to 12 minutes per hour. In-programme advertising is allowed, but counted toward the 12-minute quota, means that if a 60-minute show has 2 minutes of in-programme advertising, the commercial breaks have to be limited to 10 minutes for that specific hour, otherwise the station might face a fine. Promos for future television programs are considered as an advertisement, and also counted within the quota. Argentine television channels used to be required to separate advertising from the rest of the programming using bumpers with the text \"Espacio publicitario\" (\"Advertising space\") from September 2010 to May 2016. From March 2014, advertisements shown on Argentine television began to use the phrase \"Aviso publicitario de producci\u00f3n nacional\" (Advertisement for domestic product) and \"Aviso publicitario de producci\u00f3n extranjera\" (Advertisement for foreign product) for local and foreign advertisements, respectively. Also, advertisements for alcoholic products had the warning \"Beber con moderaci\u00f3n. Prohibida su venta a menores de 18 a\u00f1os\" (Drink in moderation. Do not sell to persons under 18). The warning was not used in alcohol advertising before 1997. ===United States=== Theater commercial about an electric refrigerator, in 1926 Around the Corner (1937) In the United States, the Nielsen ratings system measures audience viewership of television programs, and provides a way for television broadcasters to determine how popular their television shows are, so that they can decide what rates to charge advertisers for air time. For each hour in a broadcast day, advertisements take up a fairly large portion of the time. Commercial breaks have become longer. In the 1960s a typical hour-long American show would run for 51 minutes excluding advertisements. Today, a similar program would only be 42 minutes long; a typical 30-minute block of time now includes 22 minutes of programming and eight minutes of advertisements \u2013 six minutes for national advertising and two minutes for local. A television broadcast of the 101-minute film The Wizard of Oz (1939) for instance, could, in the early to mid-1960s, take two hours even with advertisements. Today, a telecast of the same film would last between 2\u00bd and three hours, including advertisements. Because of this, it is common practice to edit films to fit within the time allotted. Over the course of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown approximately three hours of advertisements, twice what they would have seen in the 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements. In the 1950s and 1960s, the average advertisement's length was one minute. Starting in the early 1970s, the average length shrank to 30 seconds. The 15-second commercial began to appear in the late 1980s. TV advertisements were coded for identification by broadcasters via an ISCI code. As of March 31, 2014, Ad-ID has been mandated as the standard method of identification for TV advertisements. A special case of TV advertisements are rare or one-time events known as Mega Event Advertising. ====Popularity==== In the United States, the TV advertisement is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format, and this is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial broadcasting airtime during popular TV events. The annual Super Bowl American football game is known as much for its commercial advertisements as for the game itself, and the average cost of a single 30-second TV spot during this game (seen by 100 million viewers) has reached US$4.5 million (as of February 2013). It has been suggested that, in general, television executives believe that advertisers covet the 18\u201349 age demographic and that older viewers are of almost no interest to most advertisers due to their unwillingness to change their buying habits. Products intended for older consumers, such as certain health products and insurance, are advertised regularly on television, generally during programming that appeals to older adults. The number of viewers within the target demographic is more important to ad revenues than total viewers. According to Advertising Age, during the 2007\u201308 season, Grey's Anatomy was able to charge $419,000 per advertisement, compared to only $248,000 for an advertisement during CSI, despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its demographic strength, Friends was able to charge almost three times as much for an advertisement as Murder, She Wrote, even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. Broadcast networks are concerned by the increasing use of DVRs by young viewers, resulting in aging of the live viewing audience and consequently, lower advertising rates. TV advertisers may also target certain audiences of the population such as certain races, and people of a certain income level or gender. In recent years, shows that tend to target young women tend to be more profitable for advertisements than shows targeted to younger men. This is due to the fact that younger men are watching TV less than their female counterparts. In the United Kingdom, television advertising is considerably cheaper than in the United States of America. The current record for an advertising slot on British terrestrial television is quoted at being \u00a3250,000 for a 30-second slot during the 2010 series of Britain's Got Talent. However while British TV advertising is cheaper, this is only to be expected as the United Kingdom has a much lower population (63 million) compared to the US (310 million). So if the \u00a3250,000 figure is adjusted into American terms, the population being 5 times bigger and the exchange rate, this figure would become $2 million, much closer to the U.S. Super Bowl figure. Because a single television advertisement can be broadcast repeatedly over the course of weeks, months, and even years (the Tootsie Roll company has been broadcasting a famous advertisement that asks \"How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie center of a Tootsie Pop?\" for over three decades), television advertisement production studios often spend very large sums of money in the production of a single thirty-second television spot. This significant expenditure has resulted in a number of high-quality advertisements with high production values, the latest in special effects technology, the most popular personalities, and the best music. A number of television advertisements are so elaborately produced that they can be considered miniature thirty-second movies; indeed, many film directors have directed television advertisements both as a way to gain exposure and to earn a paycheck. One of film director Ridley Scott's most famous cinematic moments was a television advertisement he directed for the Apple Macintosh computer, that was broadcast in 1984. Although this advertisement was broadcast only once (aside from occasional appearances in television advertisement compilation specials and one 1 a.m. airing in Idaho a month before the Super Bowl so that the advertisement could be submitted for the 1983 Clio Awards), it has become famous and well-known, to the point where it is considered a classic television moment. Despite the popularity of some advertisements, many consider them to be an annoyance for a number of reasons. The main reason may be that the sound volume of advertisements tends to be higher (and in some cases much higher) than that of regular programming. The United States Congress passed a bill on September 30, 2010, called the CALM Act, to reduce the sound volume of advertisements, and loudness rules set by the FCC are effective as of December 13, 2012. In the UK, the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice has a similar regulation. The increasing number of advertisements, as well as overplaying of the same advertisement, are secondary annoyance factors. A third might be that television is currently the main medium to advertise, prompting advertising campaigns by everyone from cell-phone companies, political campaigns, fast food restaurants, to local businesses, and small businesses, prompting longer commercial breaks. Another reason is that advertisements often cut into certain parts in the regular programming that are either climaxes of the plot or a major turning point in the show, which many people find exciting or entertaining to watch. ====Restrictions==== Television commercial in 1948 Beginning on January 2, 1971, advertisements featuring cigarettes were banned from American TV. Advertisements for alcohol products are allowed, but the consumption of any alcohol product is not allowed in a television advertisement (for example, an actor in a beer commercial cannot be shown actually drinking the beer). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have laid out regulations for television advertising, outlining restrictions on certain products, content, and claims, in addition to mandating minimum technical standards. Additional content standards are set by individual television broadcast entities to accommodate local laws, community standards, and their particular audience demographic; these broadcast outlets examine each incoming advertisement through a process known as \"clearance.\" Manufacturers of liquor products also adopted a voluntary code not to advertise on radio and television, which is particularly aimed at avoiding exposure of liquor advertisements to children. When companies dropped this ban, federal regulators appealed to the industry to reinstate code while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was also asked to look into potential restrictions on liquor advertisements on television. This was the case because, under the Communications Act, this agency has the power to regulate broadcasting as \"public convenience, interest, or necessity requires.\" Aside from the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has the authority to regulate television advertising in instances of \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce.\" The passage of the 1990 Children's Television Act (CTA), restricted the length of advertising in children's television programming to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. ====Advertisements as programming==== Since the 1960s, media critics have claimed that the boundaries between \"programming\" and \"advertisements\" have been eroded to the point where the line is blurred nearly as much as it was during the beginnings of the medium, when almost all individual television shows were sponsored entirely by a single corporation (the model which was carried over from old- time network radio). For much of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the FCC imposed a rule requiring networks that broadcast programming on Saturday morning and Sunday nights at 7 p.m./6 p.m. Central to air bumpers (\"We'll return after these messages...\", \"...now back to our programming\" and variations thereof) to help younger audiences distinguish programs from advertisements. The only programs that were exempt from this rule were news shows and information shows relating to news (such as 60 Minutes). Conditions on children's programming have relaxed to an extent since the period of the 1970s and 1980s. ==Europe== In many European countries, television advertisements appear in longer, but less frequent advertising breaks. For example, instead of 3 minutes every 8 minutes, there might be around 6 minutes every half-hour. European Union legislation limits the time taken by commercial breaks to 12 minutes per hour (20%), with a minimum segment length of 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the programme content. Live imported telecasts with shorter segments, such as U.S. sporting events, replace the original ads with promotional material. Advertising broadcast time can vary within the EU and other countries and between networks depending on local policy. Unlike in the United States, in Europe the advertising agency name may appear at the beginning or at the end of the advert. ===Croatia=== In Croatia, the commercial broadcasters may show up to 12 minutes of advertising per hour, while the public broadcaster HRT, being partially funded by a license fee, shows less advertising and usually does not interrupt series and films. Tobacco advertising is banned but alcohol and non-prescription medications can be advertised on TV. Political advertisements are allowed only in the short official campaign period before an election and only in separate blocks from other advertisements. ===Denmark=== The Danish DR-channels are funded by a television licence, so they do not show any advertisements. The other Danish television network, TV2 shows advertisements only in blocks between the programs. These can take from 2 minutes to 10 minutes depending on the time to the next show. In Denmark, commercial breaks are strictly prohibited and advertising targeted to children is restricted. Channels like Kanal 5 and TV3 are allowed to interrupt programs, as these channels are being broadcast via satellite from the United Kingdom. ===Finland=== In Finland, there are two mainstream non-commercial channels run by the state-owned broadcasting company Yle, that run advertisements only on very infrequent occasions, such as important sport events. The three main commercial channels MTV3, Sub (a subsidiary of MTV3), and Nelonen, all run their advertisements during breaks approximately every 15 minutes. Since digital TV has been introduced, the number of TV channels has grown, with Yle and the main broadcasters all adding new channels (including some subscription channels). Analogue broadcasts ceased in August 2007 and the nation's TV services are now exclusively digital. A typical break lasts about 4 minutes. The length of individual advertisements can vary from a few seconds (7, 10, and 15 are common), and they are currently rarely over one minute in length. Many advertisements of supranational companies are commonly dubbed from English language advertisements. Although Swedish is the other official language of Finland, the advertisements do not feature Swedish subtitles nor are any Swedish language advertisements shown with the infrequent exception of some political advertisements at the time of elections. ===France=== The Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel allows up to 9 minutes of advertising per hour on average in a day, and 12 minutes in an hour. Private channels can only broadcast one commercial break if the show is less than an hour and two commercial breaks if the show is more than an hour. For public channels, advertising is allowed up to 6 minutes per hour on average, and forbidden after 8 pm. ===Germany=== As in Britain, in (Germany), public television stations own a major share of the market. Their programming is funded by a licence fee as well as advertisements on specific hours of the day (20 minutes per day; not after 8 pm), except on Sundays and holidays. Private stations are allowed to show up to 12 minutes of advertisements per hour with a minimum of 20 minutes of programming in between interruptions. ===Greece=== In Greece, where most television stations and channels do not remove their logo before a commercial break, it is mandatory for public and commercial TV stations to separate the advertisements from the rest of the program with each station's ident. Subliminal advertising, tobacco and medication advertisements are not allowed. Most programmes (series, documentaries, etc.) can have one commercial break every 20 minutes. Advertisements must not exceed 15% of the broadcasting day or 20% if there are direct advertisements for buying or renting products (like informercials). A commercial break must not exceed the length of 4 minutes with the exceptions of movies/telefilms with the length exceeding the 45 minutes, which can have one commercial break for 9 minutes and of the movies/telefilms that exceed the length of 110 minutes which can have more than one commercial break every 45 minutes for 9 minutes. ===Ireland=== Filming a movie ad In Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland determines the number of adverts on commercial and community TV stations, while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for the advertising limits of Public Service Broadcasters on TV and Radio, and commercial radio advertising is governed through statute. The first television adverts were shown on December 31, 1961. But in the early years all were in B&W; but in the 1970s came in colour television arrived. Adverts were very popular over the years the most popular names were Gateaux Cakes, Tayto Crisps etc. Up to 2010 commercial broadcasters were permitted a maximum of 15% advertising time vs. overall broadcast time. In 2010 TV3 asked for an increase in advertising minutes due to the high level of competition from advertising opt-outs coming into Ireland via satellite and cable pay providers, and also the number of live ITV programmes carried by TV3 (such as The X Factor). The BAI agreed to increase the number of ads on commercial TV broadcasts to bring Irish commercial TV channels into line with UK commercial TV channels. The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland also lobbied for a similar increase, but the regulator was unable to increase their advertising minutes as these are written into Statue, meaning that any change is the responsibility of the members of the national parliament (The House of the Oireachtas). Commercial Broadcasters may not exceed 18% of their broadcast day on advertising and they may only have a maximum of 12 minutes of adverts per hour, except for children's programming where advertising may not exceed 10 minutes per hour (commercial TV broadcasters include TV3 and Setanta). Irish community TV channels rarely show advertising; however, they are permitted to show 6 minutes of advertising per hour. RT\u00c9 TV and Radio carry a maximum of 9 minutes per hour of advertising, but only an average of 6 minutes of advertising per hour, and the same rules apply to TG4: this amounts to 10% of total broadcast time. On television, RT\u00c9 cannot carry advertising on RT\u00c9 News Now and RT\u00c9jr; they do not carry advertising on programming for the under 6s, RnaG or their Digital Radio services. On the international television day, Tuesday, November 21, 2017, there was a rerun of some old television adverts after the 6 and 9.00 news on RTE1 that appeared on the Irish Film Archive on Wednesday, April 26, 2017. On Tuesday June 30, 2020 there will be more hidden Irish adverts restored on the website Britset Archives. ===Italy === Until the 1980s, the Italian television and the broadcasters of the other European countries didn't do any commercial advertisement during films, soap operas, TV series and documentaries. Usually, the publicity intervals had a duration limited from 5 to 10 minutes and hidden publicity was categorically forbidden out of the established TV timetables. The commercial TV, namely the Mediaset group founded by Silvio Berlusconi, imported in Italy a model of propaganda that was diffused by some decades before in the American countries. It consisted of short spots directly focused on attracting the consumer in the shortest possible time. The same modality was suddenly copied by the public television. ===Norway=== Television advertising is regulated by the Broadcasting Act. Public service broadcaster NRK is licence-funded, and cannot carry advertising, however, sponsorship of programs (typically sport events) is allowed. Commercial channels may interrupt television programmes with ads, but certain conditions apply. The maximum amount of advertising is 15% per hour (09 min). The nation's second-most-watched channel \u2013 TV2 \u2013 is funded by television advertisements. Norwegian-language programs broadcast from abroad \u2013 such as TV3 Norway broadcasting from the United Kingdom in the Norwegian language \u2013 must comply to British regulations. Political TV advertisements are strictly prohibited, as are all advertisements for tobacco and alcohol. TV advertisements are monitored by the Norwegian Media Authority (Medietilsynet). ===Poland=== In Poland, the national public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska, is partially funded by a licence fee. Advertising breaks on public television can be broadcast only between programmes, except for live events (mostly sport) that contain breaks which can be interrupted. Commercial broadcasters can interrupt programmes for advertising, but some channels (like e.g. Canal+) broadcast their programmes uninterrupted. Furthermore, all programmes featuring sponsor's names or products are required to announce it by a short label at the beginning and end of the programme. Tobacco and alcohol adverts are banned under the Health Protection Against the Consequences of Tobacco Use and Tobacco Articles Act of November 9, 1995, and Education in Sobriety and Counteracting Alcoholism Act of October 26, 1982, but adverts for beer, although restricted, can be shown between 20:00h and 06:00h. By agreement unhealthy food ads have been banned since January 1, 2015 on children's channels such as MiniMini+, TVP ABC and Nickelodeon and on other programming aimed at children but has been criticised for raising TV rating on nationwide general TV channels for animated movies aimed to children as well as family movies (mainly on TVN and Polsat) as well as in talent show programs involving children (e.g. The Voice Kids of TVP2 or Mali giganci of TVN) to +12 in order to avoid restrictions on unhealthy foods by making it more attractive for advertisers. Since April 1, 2017 bookmaker advertisement became restricted under amended Gambling Act of November 19, 2009 which cannot be broadcast between 06:00h and 22:00h (except for sports broadcasting) and during childhood and youth programming. ===Russia=== The Russian advertising break consists of 2 parts: federal adverts and regional adverts. The duration for each is 4 minutes and 15 minutes per hour respectively. Like Greece, Russia is one of the few countries where the television channel's logo is retained during the commercial break. In Russia, tobacco advertising is prohibited, and in 2013, this was followed suit by alcohol and medication advertising. During the Soviet era, advertising was decreed non-existent, and instead, airtime was occupied by propaganda materials. ===United Kingdom=== In the UK, the BBC is funded by a licence fee and does not screen adverts. On the commercial channels, the amount of airtime allowed by the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom for advertising is an overall average of 7 minutes per hour, with limits of 12 minutes for any particular clock hour (8 minutes per hour between 18.00 and 23.00h). With 42-minute American exports to Britain, such as Lost, being given a one-hour slot, nearly one-third of the slot is taken up by adverts or trailers for other programmes. Live imported television programmes such as WWE Raw show promotional material in place of U.S. advert breaks. Infomercials (known as \"admags\") were originally a feature of the regional commercial ITV stations from launch in 1955 but were banned in 1963. The first advert to be shown on ITV in the UK was an advert for S.R. Toothpaste on September 22, 1955. On July 1, 2000, TV broadcasters began requiring commercials to be delivered to them in widescreen, an event referred to as C-Day in industry promotion of the change. In 2008, Ofcom announced a review of television advertising and teleshopping regulations, with a view to possibly changing their code, Rules on the Amount and Distribution of Advertising (RADA), which regulates the duration, frequency and restriction of adverts on television. Television advertising specialist, Nick Illston, of advertising-buying agency Pace Media, states that ITV's \u00a3250,000 asking price for a 30-second slot during the 2010 series of Britain's Got Talent is currently the most expensive advertising slot on television. After a dip in popularity around 2014 TV advertising is now back on the rise. With on-demand services in the video field as well as music, the game has changed, but TV stations have found a way to integrate their standard TV advertising into their streaming platforms. When you include on-demand viewing, commercial TV reaches 91.9% of the UK every week, which means the average broadcast TV ad campaign gets 237 million views. \u00a35.28 billion was invested in TV advertising in 2016, that's up 0.2% from the year before. , it was forecast to grow by another 1.6%. Paid for political advertising is banned on television in the United Kingdom. Instead parties are given a free Party political broadcast at the time of an election. ==Asia and Oceania== Depending on its style, system and other factors while in the process of broadcasting commercial breaks and TV advertisements, some officials (like government, associations, institutions, etc.) regulate and monitor the assets and broadcasting TV advertisements based on international standards. ===Australia=== Similar to the European Union, advertising on Australian commercial television is restricted to a certain amount in a 24-hour period, but there are no restrictions on how much advertising may appear in any particular hour. Australian television has one of the highest proportions of advertising content in the world. Currently, in primetime on Seven and Nine\u2019s primary channels there can be 686 minutes or more of heavy advertising (inc. local news updates) per day. During live sports broadcasts, individual commercial breaks last for 30 seconds instead of 3\u20135 minutes. Furthermore, product advertisements with informational content are labeled \"public service announcements\" and not included in the time restrictions; similarly with sponsorship announcements, and station identifications. Consequently, there may be less than 40 minutes of actual programme time per hour. Foreign, all television programmes and films are noticeably cut, re- edited for digital Channels; comedy shows often return from an ad break into laughter, for instance. Australia is also one of the few countries in the world where advertisements may appear prior to, and over the top of, the closing credits of a program. There are some restrictions on television advertising in Australia, such as a complete ban on advertising for cigarettes, as well as advertising during programmes intended for young children. The ABC, the nation's public broadcaster, broadcasts no external advertisements, but between programmes will broadcast promotions for itself, its own programmes and merchandise, although this is restricted to approximately five minutes per hour. SBS had similar restrictions on advertising until 2005 when it began airing external advertisements between programmes, and subsequently, during programmes, like the commercial networks, although still limited to 5 minutes per hour with the first advertisement being half-hourly news updates. Back in 1978, major commercial networks had the longest ever ad break run with the record 353 minutes of advertising. ===India=== In India, the Code for Self-Regulation of Advertising in India, established by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), is applicable on Television Commercials (TVCs). If consumers see an advertisement which they consider misleading or offensive, they can write to ASCI. As per the provisions under The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995, and the Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels from India (first introduced in 2000), give the government the power to block the transmission and re-transmission of any channel in the country. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has clear guidelines for TV advertising in India. The Indian television channels are widely segmented through Broadcast television, Cable television, Satellite television, Internet Protocol television. There are 857 permitted private satellite stations and also 190 government channels under the list of television stations in India. The TV advertising rate varies for TV ad spots, regional/national channels, prime/non-prime time and also on the media planning platform. The Advertising Standards Council of India has defined the principles and guidelines for individuals, corporate bodies and associations engaged in or otherwise concerned with the practice of advertising for medium such as television. The principles include honest representations, non-offensive to public, against harmful products/situations, fair in competition. The guidelines include Automotives & Safety, Educational Institutions, Foods & Beverages, Disclaimers in an Advertisement. ===Indonesia=== Television advertisements in Indonesia currently based on Act No. 32 of 2002 on Broadcasting and regulated by the KPI. All advertisements must pass the censorship criteria set by the Film Censor Board (LSF) before airing. Television advertisements began airing on TVRI on 1 March 1963, about half a year after the first broadcast. The New Order government officially banned television advertisements on TVRI starting 1 April 1981, effectively stopped television advertisements in Indonesia as TVRI was the only television channel at the time. However, as the private television stations emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s they were allowed to air commercials, while TVRI could not be allowed to broadcast advertisements until 2000. According to the act, advertising time is limited to both public broadcasters (i.e. TVRI and local public broadcasters) and commercial private broadcasters. While received funding from state or local budgets, public broadcasters are allowed to run advertisements to a maximum of 15% of their broadcast time. In contrast, public service announcements for a minimum of 30% of its advertising time should be air. Commercial broadcasters could run advertisements to a maximum of 20% of their broadcast time, while they should air a minimum of 10% of advertising time for public service announcements. Cigarette advertisements are still allowed between 21.30 \u2013 05.00 in local time but are prohibited from demonstrating the appearance of cigarettes and smoking activities. Any advertisements featuring liquor are banned. ===Japan=== In Japan, TV advertisements are called \"Commercial Messages\" or CMs. There are many kinds of advertisements, one is called the \"Cow-catcher\" where the advertisements are shown before the start of a program, the \"Hitch-hiking\" type where the commercials are shown after the end of the program, and the \"Spot CM\" are the commercials being shown on commercial breaks. There are regulations for example: commercials for pachinko parlors are prohibited from being shown from 5AM to 9AM, and from 5PM to 8PM.http://www.minapachi.net/column/article/3/511 Tobacco advertisements are banned since 1998. To prevent underage drinking, alcohol commercials are banned from being shown from 5AM to 6PM. ===Malaysia=== In Malaysia, a government department monitors television advertisements rather than a private institution. Almost all television stations and channels in the country, whether government-owned, private or pay television channels, broadcast advertisements, with television channel logos removed before the start of the commercial break. There are usually two commercial breaks in a half-hour programme and three commercial breaks in an hour-long programme, with the exception of news programmes. Terrestrial television can only broadcast advertisements during the programme that was currently aired except before announcing the breaking of fast in the month of Ramadan, although advertisements may be included during CJ Wow Shop on Media Prima television channels such as NTV7 and TV9 as of June 2016. Because Malaysian television advertisements were controlled by the government department, the Malaysian TV advertising permit number appears during the first few seconds of any advertisement. The abbreviation at the first part of the permit number which refers to the ministry which handles the TV advertising permit number always changes sometime after the Malaysian government made a new portfolio of ministers and name changes to some ministries after the general election. The usage of advertising code began in 1995, with KP/YYYY/XXXX of which KP means Ministry of Information, YYYY is the year the advertisement produced and the XXXX is the number of the advert permit. This was replaced by KPKK (Ministry of Information, Communications and Culture) and KKMM (Ministry of Communications and Multimedia of Malaysia) in 2009 and 2013, respectively. The usage of advertising code has declined in recent years, although it remains in use in almost all advertisements shown on RTM. Other advertising permits includes the KKLIU (Ministry of Health, the Medicine Advertising Authority) for medicinal advertisements, which was used before 1995 and the JIRP (Pesticide Advertising Department) for pesticide advertisements. All pesticide advertisements must show the words \"INI IKLAN RACUN MAKHLUK PEROSAK\" (This is a pesticide advertisement, previously INI ADALAH IKLAN RACUN PEROSAK) and JIRP advertising code at the beginning of the advertisement and the words \"BACA LABEL SEBELUM GUNA\" (Read the label before use, previously BACALAH LABEL KELUARAN SEBELUM MENGGUNAKANNYA) at the end of the advertisement. It was also used in advertisements on newspapers and magazines. Astro is also known to delay incoming satellite feeds by two to five minutes (some channels delay by one hour) from the actual time of the start and the end of programme (for example a programme aired at 13:30 will be started at 13:33) with broadcasting advertisements during in-between programmes for its purpose of commercial replacement, as government laws forbid advertisements produced from overseas, with exceptions such as film trailers (since release dates may include more than one country). Liquor advertisements shown after 22:00 during non-Malay programmes have been banned in the country since 1995, while cigarette advertisements were banned from showing cigarette packaging in 1995, and were banned entirely in 2003. Fast-food advertisements during children's programmes were also banned in 2007. There are also restrictions on Malaysian television regarding advertisements for 18-rated films, women's sanitary products and unhealthy foods which must not be broadcast during children's programmes, and lottery advertising, which is prohibited during Malay programmes. Lingerie advertisements are prohibited on Malaysian television, but allowed in non- Malay magazines published in Malaysia. Also, promotion of television programmes for sponsored programmes are treated separately from programme promotions, though some channels had the sponsor name being advertised in programme promos. ===New Zealand=== All major New Zealand television channels, both state-owned and private, screen advertisements. Adverts on average taking up 14 minutes of each hour; there are usually two advert breaks in a half-hour programme, and four advert breaks in an hour-long programme. Television advertising began in New Zealand in April 1961, ten months after the first official television broadcast, and was initially allowed only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Today, television adverts are only prohibited on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, and between 6:00 am and midday on Sundays, Christmas Day and Anzac Day. The Advertising Standards Authority is responsible for advertisement compliance, and deals with advertisement complaints (except for election advertising, in which the Broadcasting Standards Authority is responsible). ===Philippines=== Philippines advertising industry is self- regulated. The Philippine advertising industry adopted an Advertising Code of Ethics essentially to promote efficiency in processing applications and resolution cases and avoid costly litigation in regular courts. The earliest Advertising Code of Ethics dates back to the Philippine Board of Advertising (PBA) established in 1974. In 1989, the PBA was renamed Advertising Board of the Philippines (ADBOARD) and was mandated by the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 7394 or The Consumer Protection Act to ensure that all advertising materials conform to its Code of Ethics. The ADBOARD Advertising Content & Regulations Committee (ACRC) had been the main implementing arm of advertising self-regulation in the Philippines until March 31, 2008, when the Ad Standards Council (ASC) took over this function.http://www.asc.com.ph/about-asc/story-of-asc The Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines, a self-regulatory organization representing most television and radio broadcasters in the country, limit advertising to 18 minutes per hour, a move taken to help \"promote public interest.\"\"KBP: Only 18 minutes of ads per hour\", Inquirer Entertainment, In this case some TV broadcasters have to remove channel logos (like ABS-CBN, 5 & GMA) before starting a commercial break.

Under the current rules, terrestrial channels cannot take in-programme commercial breaks. So, the advertisements are usually put between the intro and the start of a programme, and between the end credits and the end of the programme. Terrestrial channels often divide some longer-length films like The Ten Commandments into parts and consider each part as an individual programme. Terrestrial channels can take commercial breaks during breaks in action during sporting events. Pay- television channels can take in-programme commercial breaks, although some pay TV channels schedule advertisements in the same way that terrestrial channels do. Regulations for advertisements on terrestrial channels are more strict than those for pay channels. Non-South Korean channels are not subject to these regulations. Tobacco advertisements are prohibited. ==References== Category:Television advertising Category:Articles containing video clips ",
