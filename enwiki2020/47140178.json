On July 1, 2015, the program was re-launched on Sportsnet as a dedicated television program. On October 14, 2019, the Tim & Sid telecasts began simulcasting on CJCL, replacing Prime Time Sports as its late afternoon drive program. Tim & Sid airs weeknights from 5 to 7 p.m. ET. The telecast is frequently shortened to 90 minutes to allow for pre-game coverage of Toronto Blue Jays and National Hockey League (NHL) games.

When neither Tim nor Sid are able to host, Donnovan Bennett, Faizal Khamisa, Alex Seixeiro, or Danielle Michaud would serve as substitute hosts. == History == Tim & Sid was launched in 2011 as an afternoon radio show on CJCL, a sports talk radio station owned by Rogers Media in Toronto. The program gained a television simulcast on Micallef and Seixeiro's previous home, The Score in May 2013, coinciding with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) approval of Rogers' acquisition of the network (since renamed Sportsnet 360). Tim & Sid became known for the pair's freeform style, and proved popular among a younger audience and a loyal group of fans. The program gained further attention from viral videos during the 2014 Winter Olympics, such as their live reaction to Canada's winning goal in the gold medal game of the Women's hockey tournament. On January 20, 2015, Rogers announced major changes to CJCL's lineup, including the replacement of Tim & Sid with Greg Brady and Andrew Walker as its new afternoon show. Concurrently, Sportsnet announced that Tim & Sid would be re-launched as a television program, premiering on July 1, 2015. Scott Moore, president of Sportsnet and NHL properties at Rogers, likened Tim & Sid to being a \"sports content factory\" operating across multiple platforms (including television and social media), and explained that Micallef and Seixeiro \"are not just highlight guys, they know how to engage on any sports topic and the great thing about these guys is they can connect with sports fans on any number of levels.\" In 2019, when the Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship, Micallef and Seixeiro co-hosted Rogers coverage on Sportsnet and Citytv of the championship parade alongside Breakfast Television Toronto\u2019s Dina Pugliese.Tim And Sid live with BT at Raptors Parade Breakfast Television On September 25, 2019, it was announced that a simulcast of the program would air on CJCL beginning October 14, replacing Prime Time Sports. ==Ratings== During its first month re- launched as a dedicated television program, the show grew Sportsnet's audience by 19% in the 5 to 7 p.m. ET timeslot year-over-year.
