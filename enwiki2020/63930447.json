Its southern terminus is at an intersection with SR 87 in southern Coconino County, north of the Mogollon Rim. From there, Lake Mary Road (CR 3) heads north-northwest, traveling for before reaching the tiny community of Happy Jack. After that, the road curves north heading towards Mormon Lake, the largest natural lake in Arizona. During the winter months, the stretch of Lake Mary Road east of Mormon Lake is closed, and travelers using the road must take Mormon Lake Road around the west side of the lake before getting back onto Lake Mary Road. Roughly north of Mormon Lake, the road passes by Upper Lake Mary, at which point it heads west-northwest past Lower Lake Mary and towards Flagstaff. Upon reaching Flagstaff city limits, CR 3 ends and Lake Mary Road continues. The road reaches its northern end at Beulah Boulevard in Flagstaff, at the southwest corner of the Interstate 17/Interstate 40 (I-17/I-40) interchange. Lake Mary Road, sometimes referred to as Forest Highway 3, is known for its recreational opportunities, as it runs through pine forest areas and past three northern Arizona lakes. It is also renowned for its gently rolling hills and wide roadway shoulders, making bicycling along the road attractive. The road has also become a destination for recreational runners, because the road has wide shoulders and easy access to trail-heads and parking spots. The road maintains a minimum elevation of approximately above sea level for its entire length, while its peak elevation is over above sea level. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *USFS map of Lake Mary Road (2013) Category:Transportation in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Streets in Arizona Category:Flagstaff, Arizona ",
