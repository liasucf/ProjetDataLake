    "text": "Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes is the third studio album by American punk rock band AFI. It was released on November 11, 1997 through Nitro Records. ==Background== This is the first album to feature bassist Hunter Burgan, although he was not a permanent member at the time as well as the final album to feature founding guitarist Mark Stopholese. Future band member Jade Puget performed backing vocals for the album as well, making Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes the first AFI album the band's current members collaborated in. Nick 13 from American rock band Tiger Army is featured in the track \"A Single Second\", performing vocals in the chorus of the song. A music video directed by Darren Doane and Ken Daurio was made for the track \"Third Season.\" It features the band themselves sitting in a suburban town while a slew of children chase an ice cream truck. The inner-edge of the album's CD case reveals the hidden message \"A Fire Inside\", a lyric from the introductory track \"Keeping Out of Direct Sunlight\". This is the first album to quote the phrase, which eventually became AFI's permanent acronym. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * AFI \u2013 producer * Hunter Burgan \u2013 bass, programming, keyboards, backing vocals * Adam Carson \u2013 drums, backing vocals * Andy Ernst \u2013 engineer * Davey Havok \u2013 lead vocals * Mark Stopholese \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Nick 13 \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals; harmony vocals * Jade Puget \u2013 additional guitar, additional programming, additional keyboard, backing vocals * Eddy Shreyer \u2013 masterering ;Studios * Recorded at Art of Ears, Hayward, CA * Mastered at Oasis ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:AFI (band) albums Category:Nitro Records albums ",
