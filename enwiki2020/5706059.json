He was also the husband of Jeanne de Valois-Saint- Remy, whom he married on 6 June 1780. He claimed to be a nobleman and gave himself the title of Comte (Count). However, his claim to nobility was dubious. At the time of his marriage, he was known only as an officer of the gendarmes.Andr\u00e9 Castelot \"Queen of France\", page 202 Through his wife's influence on her paramour, the Cardinal de Rohan, he later obtained a commission as the Count of Artois's bodyguard.Vincent Cronin \"Louis and Antoinette\", page 239 == References == Category:1755 births Category:1831 deaths Category:18th-century French people Category:19th-century French people Category:People of the French Revolution Category:House of Valois-Saint-Remy ",
