    "text": "{| |} The Kamov Ka-10 (NATO reporting name HatGunston 1995, p. XXX.) was a Soviet single-seat observation helicopter that first flew in 1949. ==Design and development== The Ka 10 was a development of Nikolay Kamov's earlier Ka-8, which had been successful enough to allow Kamov to set up his own OKB (design bureau) in 1948. The Ka-10 was of similar layout to the Ka-8, with an open steel-tube structure carrying an engine, a pilot's seat and two three-bladed coaxial rotors.Apostolo 1984, p. 108. It was larger, however, with a revised transmission and rotor hub design, and a new engine specially designed for the helicopter, the Ivchenko AI-4 flat-four.Alexander 1975, pp. 146\u2013147.Gunston 1995, p. XIX. ==Operational history== The Ka-10 made its maiden flight in September 1949. Three more prototypes followed, which were evaluated by Soviet Naval Aviation. A Ka-10 was displayed at the 1950 Tushino Air Display, and one made the first landing by a Soviet helicopter on the deck of a ship on 7 December 1950. In 1954, 12 of an improved version, the Ka-10M were built for the Maritime Border Troops. They had a twin tail rather than the single vertical fin of the Ka-10 and modified rotors and control systems. ==Variants== * Ka-10 : Single-seat observation helicopter. * Ka-10M : Improved version fitted with twin tailfins and rudders. ==Operators== ; *Soviet Navy ==Specifications== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Alexander, Jean.
