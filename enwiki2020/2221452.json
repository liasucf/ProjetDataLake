    "text": "Staphylococcus xylosus is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Staphylococcus. It is a Gram-positive bacterium that forms clusters of cells. Like most staphylococcal species, it is coagulase-negative and exists as a commensal on the skin of humans and animals and in the environment.Karl H. Schleifer and Wesley E. Kloos: Isolation and Characterization of Staphylococci from Human Skin I. Amended Descriptions of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Descriptions of Three New Species: Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus xylosus. Int J Syst Bacteriol January 1975 25:50-61; . Staphylococcus xylosus may be used as CNC (coagulase-negative cocci) in salami fermentation.Aquilanti, L., Garofalo, C., Osimani, A. and Clementi, F.: Ecology of lactic acid bacteria and coagulase negative cocci in fermented dry sausages manufactured in Italy and other Mediterranean countries: an overview, in: International Food Research Journal 23(2): 429-445 (2016) It appears to be far more common in animals than in humans. S. xylosus has very occasionally been identified as a cause of human infection, but in some cases it may have been misidentified. ==Identification== S. xylosus is normally sensitive to fleroxacin, methicillin, penicillin, teicoplanin, erythromycin and tetracycline, and resistant to novobiocin. It is highly active biochemically, producing acid from a wide variety of carbohydrates. Acid and gas are produced from D-(+)-galactose, D-(+)-mannose, D-(+)-mannitol, maltose, and lactose. Caseinolytic and gelatinase activities are normally present. It normally produces slime but not capsules. This ability is lost upon subculture. Its cell wall peptidoglycan is similar to the L-Lys-Gly3-5 L-Ser0.6-1.5 type found in predominantly human species. ==Clinical importance== Staphylococcus xylosus is a member of the skin flora of humans and other animals. It has been associated with: *Nasal dermatitis in gerbils *Pyelonephritis in humans *Avian staphylococcosis *Bovine intermammary infection It is also found in milk, cheese, and sausage. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Type strain of Staphylococcus xylosus at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-positive bacteria xylosus Category:Bacteria described in 1975 ",
