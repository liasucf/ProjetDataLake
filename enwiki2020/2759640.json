    "text": "The personality\u2013job fit theory postulates that a person's personality traits will reveal insight as to adaptability within an organization. The degree of confluence between a person and the organization is expressed as their Person- Organization (P-O) fit.Anderson, C, Flynn, F, Spataro, S (2008). Personality and Organizational Culture as Determinants of Influence. Journal of Applied Psychology, 53 (3) This is also referred to as a person\u2013environment fit.McMichael, A. J. 1978. Personality, behavioral, and situational modifiers of work stressors. In Cooper, C. L., & Payne, R. (Eds.). Stress at work. New York: Wiley.Carroll, J. F. X., & White, W. L. 1982. Theory building: Integrating individual and environmental factors within an ecological framework. In Paine, W. S. (Ed.). Job stress and burnout. Beverly Hills: Sage.Cable, D. M., & Parsons, C. K. 2001. Socialization tactics and person\u2013organization fit. Personnel Psychology, 54(1): 1\u201323, Spring. A common measure of the P-O fit is workplace efficacy; the rate at which workers are able to complete tasks. These tasks are mitigated by workplace environs- for example, a worker who works more efficiently as an individual than in a team will have a higher P-O fit for a workplace that stresses individual tasks (such as accountancy). By matching the right personality with the right job, company workers can achieve a better synergy and avoid pitfalls such as high turnover and low job satisfaction. Employees are more likely to stay committed to organizations if the fit is 'good'. In practice, P-O fit would be used to gauge integration with organizational competencies. The Individual is assessed on these competencies, which reveals efficacy, motivation, influence, and co- worker respect. Competencies can be assessed using various tools like psychological tests, assessment centres competency based interview, situational analysis, etc. If the Individual displays a high P-O fit, we can say that the Individual would most likely be able to adjust to the company environment and work culture, and would be able to perform at an optimum level. ==See also== * Aptitude * Onboarding * Person-environment fit * Social influence * Trait activation theory ==Notes== Category:Organizational behavior ",
