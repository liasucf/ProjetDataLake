    "text": "\"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings. It was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972. The song was recorded around the same time as \"C Moon\", in November 1972. ==Release== The single peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the United Kingdom and at number 10 in the United States in January 1973. The song became a staple of Wings' live shows in the 1970s. The song was included on the 2001 Paul McCartney compilation album Wingspan: Hits and History and as a bonus track on the 1993 and 2018 reissues of Red Rose Speedway. ==Ban== In the UK, the song was banned by the BBC for its sexually suggestive lyrical content. The BBC also assumed that the title phrase, \"We're gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug reference. The specific lyrics objected to is the apparent phrase \"get you ready for my body gun\"; McCartney has said that the correct lyrics are \"get you ready for my polygon\", an abstract image, and later said, \"The BBC got some of the words wrong. But I suppose it is a bit of a dirty song if sex is dirty and naughty. I was in a sensuous mood in Spain when I wrote it.\" Furthermore, Paul refers back to the song when it's played for a live audience - \"Yeah, well, the great laugh is when we go live, it makes a great announcement. You can say \u201cThis one was banned!\u201d and everyone goes \u201cHooray!\u201d The audience love it, you know. \u201cThis next one was banned,\u201d and then you get raving, because everyone likes to. Everyone\u2019s a bit anti-all-that- banning, all that censorship. Our crew, our generation, really doesn\u2019t dig that stuff, as I\u2019m sure you know.\" ==Personnel== The musicians who played on the song are as follows: *Paul McCartney \u2013 vocals, electric guitar, bass guitar *Linda McCartney \u2013 vocals, organ *Denny Laine \u2013 vocals, electric guitar *Henry McCullough \u2013 electric guitar *Denny Seiwell \u2013 drums, cowbell ==References== Category:1972 singles Category:1972 songs Category:1973 singles Category:Apple Records singles Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:Songs banned by the BBC Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Songs written by Linda McCartney Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Wings (band) songs ",
