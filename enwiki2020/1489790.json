It is the part of the city centre in the wider sense as one of the 18\u201319th century older suburbs, close to Belv\u00e1ros. Budapest, St. Joseph Parish Church ==Location== The main streets in J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros are Baross utca, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi \u00fat and \u00dcll\u0151i \u00fat; K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r connects this district with the 5th and 9th. Keleti (Eastern) Railway Station is located at the junction of 7th, 8th and 14th districts. ==Name== The 18th century suburb was first called Als\u00f3-K\u00fclv\u00e1ros (literally \"Lower Suburb\"). It was named after the heir of the Hungarian throne, Emperor Joseph II in 1777. ==Description== J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros mostly consists of old, often neglected residential buildings with nice interiors. It can be divided into three parts, the borders being Grand Boulevard (Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat) and the roads Fiumei \u00fat and Orczy \u00fat. The innermost, central part includes several remarkable spots, such as the National Museum, and the central buildings of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, the Semmelweis University, the Academy of Drama and Film, and the Metropolitan Ervin Szab\u00f3 Library, complemented by the Kempelen Farkas Student Information and Resource Centre. The Piarist Secondary School, the main building of the K\u00e1roli G\u00e1sp\u00e1r University of the Reformed Church, and the Law Faculty of the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University are also situated here, as well as the Hungarian Radio. This part is called \"Palace Quarter\", out of which one can still see Wenckheim Palace, hosting the Metropolitan Library, and P\u00e1lffy Palace with the Classical Music Collection of the above. This neighborhood underwent major renovations between 1996 and 2002 and it has become a happy, swarming place with scores of students and several caf\u00e9s and pizzerias. J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros railway station The second part, beyond Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat (about farther) has a worse reputation, due to the prostitution that was rampant in the 1990s (and earlier), which has been mostly eliminated through cameras throughout the district. In this part one can find the Centre for Foreign Languages (the oldest and \"authentic\" language examination place in Hungary), Erkel Theatre (a department of the Hungarian State Opera House), the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Corvin Budapest Film Palace (a multiplex cinema), one of Budapest's biggest gardens (Orczy-kert), and a large complex of cliniques. Its traditional craftsmen neighbourhood, which became a slum in the previous decades, is currently under re-development. The dilapidated 19th century housing stock is cleared to make way for large office blocks and housing developments.
