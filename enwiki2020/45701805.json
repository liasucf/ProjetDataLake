On his league debut, in the opening round of the season against Footscray, Miller came on as a reserve in the last quarter. His only other appearance came in round three, when Geelong beat Melbourne at the MCG. Miller started the game on this occasion. ==Country football== He returned to Echuca in 1975, then spent two seasons with Turvey Park, a Wagga Wagga-based club in the South Western District Football League (SWDFL). In 1977 he was runner-up in the SWDFL's Gammage Medal and played in Turvey Park's premiership team, as an assistant coach. ==ACTAFL== In 1978, Miller became captain-coach of ACT Australian Football League club Eastlake, which he led to a premiership in his first season, with a grand final win over Kevin Neale's Ainslie. The following year he won a Mulrooney Medal as well as the first of three successive club best and fairest awards. He spent the 1980 season as a player only, then at the end of the year was appointed coach of Belconnen. Before the 1981 season began, Miller resigned as coach and returned to Eastlake. He won a second Mulrooney Medal in 1981 and was an Alex Jesaulenko Medalist in 1982 for his performance in Eastlake's grand final loss to Ainslie.
