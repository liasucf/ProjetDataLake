The Houthis claimed that these missiles could violate the blockade imposed by UN resolution 2216 imposed by the Arab Coalition. American reports suggest that this missile was designed to attack nearby targets like Jizan without expending their diminishing stock of longer range missiles. It is somewhat similar to Iranian Oghab missiles, however it lacks fins. All civil airports in Jizan, Asir and Najran have been closed due to the risk of missile strikes since July 2015. ==Characteristics== ===Al-Najm al-Thaqib 1=== Al-Najm al- Thaqib 1 has a range of 45 km and a warhead of 50 kg explosive. ===Al-Najm al- Thaqib 2=== Al-Najm al-Thaqib 2 has a range of 75 km and a warhead of 75 kg explosive. == References == Category:Rocket artillery Category:Ballistic missiles Category:Tactical ballistic missiles Category:Tactical ballistic missiles of Yemen Category:Surface-to-surface missiles Category:Surface-to- surface missiles of Yemen Category:Ballistic missiles of Yemen Category:Guided missiles of Yemen Category:Theatre ballistic missiles ",
