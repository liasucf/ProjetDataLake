Parramatta Council is situated between the City of Ryde and Cumberland, where the Cumberland Plain meets the Hornsby Plateau, approximately west of the Sydney central business district, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The City occupies an area of spanning across suburbs in Greater Western Sydney, the Hills District and a small section of Northern Sydney to the far north east of its area. According to the , City of Parramatta Council had an estimated population of . The City houses the Parramatta central business district which is one of the key suburban employment destinations for the region of Greater Western Sydney. The Lord Mayor of the City of Parramatta Council since 23 September 2019 is The Right Worshipful Bob Dwyer, a member of the Liberal Party. == History == City of Parramatta boundaries, 1949\u20132016 First incorporated on 27 November 1861 as the \"Municipality of Parramatta\", the first Mayor was emancipated convict John Williams who arrived in the colony in 1835. The council became known as the \"Borough of Parramatta\" on 23 December 1867 following the enactment of the Municipalities Act, 1867, and became a Municipality again following the 1906 Local Government Act. On 27 October 1938, the Local Government (City of Parramatta) Act was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales and proclaimed by the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, making the town the \"City of Parramatta\". From 1 January 1949 the \"City of Parramatta\" was re- formed following the passing of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, when the councils of Ermington and Rydalmere (incorporated 1891), Dundas (incorporated 1889) and Granville (incorporated 1885) were merged into the council area. The Parramatta local government area was further expanded through the transfer of 10.7km2 from the Municipality of Blacktown in 1972. In recognition of Parramatta's role Bi-centennial (coinciding with the Australian Bi-centennial), the title of 'Lord Mayor' was granted on 12 December 1988 by Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of Premier Nick Greiner. This made Parramatta the third Australian city that was not a capital to receive such an honour, after Newcastle and Wollongong. ===2016 amalgamation=== A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Parramatta be reformed, adding areas from several adjoining councils. The NSW Government subsequently proposed a merger of parts of Parramatta (Woodville Ward), Auburn and Holroyd and a second merger of parts of the rest of Parramatta and parts of Auburn, The Hills, Hornsby, and Holroyd to form a new council. On 12 May 2016, Parramatta City Council was abolished by the NSW Government. Parts of Auburn City Council (south of the M4 Western Motorway) and Parramatta City Council (Woodville Ward), and Holroyd City Council merged to form the Cumberland Council as a new local government area and the remainder of the Parramatta City Council, Auburn City Council north of the M4 Western Motorway (including Sydney Olympic Park), and small parts of Hornsby Shire, Holroyd and The Hills Shire were merged into the reformed \"City of Parramatta Council\". ==Suburbs in the local government area== Suburbs in the City of Parramatta Council are: ==Facilities== The City of Parramatta Council has a central library, heritage centre and six branch libraries at Carlingford, Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Epping, Ermington and Wentworth Point.
