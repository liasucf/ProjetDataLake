She graduated from Simmons College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968, then obtained her master's degree in Social Work from the University of Connecticut. ==Advocacy== Soler became interested in anti- violence advocacy after heading a speech from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Bridgeport. In 1971, she became a social worker in San Francisco, assisting women in a drug treatment program. Solar learned that many of the women with drug dependencies had also suffered domestic abuse, and that trauma from that abuse was a leading contributor to their addictions. She also learned that law enforcement did not take domestic violence seriously, and frequently did not arrest the abusers. Soler established the Family Violence Prevention Fund in San Francisco in 1980 to develop responses to domestic violence nationwide. Soler has served a consultant and/or advisor for the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the Aspen Institute, and the Soros Justice Fellowship Program. Soler's work to prevent violence against women was featured on MAKERS, an interactive video and documentary project launched by AOL and PBS. Soler delivered a TEDTalk charting 30 years of tactics and technologies\u2014from the Polaroid camera to social media\u2014that have shaped the movement to end domestic violence. ==Recognition== * Koret Israel Prize in 1995 * Kellogg Foundation National Leadership Fellowship 1998 * University of California Public Health Heroes Award in 1998 * Honors from the Center for the Advancement of Women * Leadership Award from the Coro Center for Civic Leadership * Mathew O.
