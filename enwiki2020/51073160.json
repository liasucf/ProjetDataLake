    "text": "Abel Alejandre (1968, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico) is a Mexican-born, United States- based hyperrealist artist, best known for his explorations of masculinity and vulnerability. Working primarily in pencil, Alejandre creates intricately cross-hatched drawings that can take months to complete. Alejandre's series of twelve panels, \"Panoramas,\" is featured at the Los Angeles Metro Rancho Park/Westwood station. Alejandre also creates woodblock prints using both a giant press he built himself and by hand printing. His monumental My Fathers, which is in the permanent collection at the National Museum of Mexican Art, in Chicago, IL, was created by the latter method. ==Early life and education== Abel Alejandre was born in Apatzing\u00e1n, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. As a young child he worked in the cotton fields to earn money for his family. In 1975, when he was 7, the family immigrated to the United States via Tijuana where he encountered running water, electricity, and television for the first time. Alejandre grew up in the Long Beach area of Southern California and attended Long Beach City College, graduating with an Associate of Arts degree. ==Work== After painting in color for 25 years, Alejandre began working in black and white, becoming completely focused on creating monochromatic works. His trademark crosshatching is created by gessoing and sanding the surface of the canvas or panels and then beginning work with pencil. A single piece of art can take over 5 months to complete, with the artist working 10 to 12 hours a day, and can use over 700 pencils. In 2013, Alejandre was announced as one of eight grantee artists whose art would be installed at one of the Los Angeles Metro stations along the new Expo line that runs from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica beach. His twelve panels, \u201cPanoramas,\u201d are displayed at the Rancho Park/Westwood station. Panels \u201cdepict the legs of travelers headed to their destinations: a business professional with her rolling briefcase, a parent with a stroller, and a hummingbird in flight,\u201d creating \u201cstory of place through the act of commuting.\u201d His gallery work focuses around issues of machismo and masculinity and he uses art \u201cas a means to acknowledge and process what he confesses to be \u2018past insecurities, insults, and painful memories.\u2019\u201d Alejandre created murals for the 1984 Olympic Games and in 2005 curated and staged an exhibition of Mexican and American artists on the border fence in Mexicali/Calexico border. In 2011, he worked with the gallery, Avenue 50 Studio, a recipient of Southern California Council for the Humanities grant on \"Resurrected Histories: Voices from the Chicano Arts Collectives of Highland Park.\" His art is featured in the book Drawing from the Inside Out: Projects for Beginning through Advanced Drawing, and he is featured in two films by Eric Minh Swenson. Alejandre's artworks have been exhibited at venues that include Coagula Curatorial Gallery, Center for the Arts Eagle Rock, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Tropico de Nopal and the Mexican Cultural Institute. His monumental wood block print, My Fathers, is part of the permanent collection at the National Museum of Mexican Art, in Chicago, IL. ==Public Collections== *National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, IL *Metro Art Collection, Los Angeles, CA ==Select Exhibitions== ===2017=== * \"Committed to the Line,\" Fullerton College Art Gallery, Fullerton, CA ===2016=== *Public Secrets, Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA ===2015=== *Abandoned Superhero, Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA, USA *The Drawing Show, The Loft at Liz's, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Frank|LA, No Place Like Home, Imperial Art Studios, Los Angeles, CA, USA *ARTillery: Contemporary Art Influenced by Weaponry, Mesa Contemporary Art Museum, Mesa, AZ, USA *Aqui Estamos / We Are Here California Chican@ Art, Cabrillo Gallery, Aptos, CA, USA *Funny Face: Group Show of New Portraiture, Red Pipe Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Beverly Hills Art Fair, Coagula Curatorial booth, Beverly Hills, CA, USA *Palm Springs Fine Art Fair: post-war and contemporary art, Coagula Curatorial booth, Palm Springs, CA, USA *LA Art Show: Historic | Modern | Contemporary, special exhibition booth, \"Dark Progressivism: Metropolis Rising,\" Los Angeles, CA, USA *LA Art Show: Historic | Modern | Contemporary, Coagula Curatorial booth, Los Angeles, CA, USA ===2014=== *Los Angeles Contraventions, Galerie Merkel, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany *ANEKANTAVADA Diverse Perspectives in Art, Norco College Art Gallery, Norco, CA, USA ===2013=== *Size Really Does Matter, Los Angeles Municipal Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *La Xilograf\u00eda: Mexican Woodcut Prints, Fullerton College Art Gallery, Fullerton, CA, USA *100 A\u00f1os De Posada Y Su Catrina, National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, IL, USA *Summer Group Show, Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Encore: bringing one back for another experience, Palos Verdes Art Center, Palos Verdes, CA, USA Latino Heritage, ChimMaya Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *SHG Print Fair and Exhibition, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Chicano y Que, Plaza De La Raza Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Salon Style Saturday, Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Signature Works: 25th Anniversary Gifts to the Permanent Collection, National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, IL, USA ===2012=== *La Junta/ The Gathering, Centro Estatal de las Artes, Mexicali, BC, Mexico *La Junta/ The Gathering, Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Miami Project Art Fair, Cuagula Curatorial, Miami, FL, USA *8From Bukowski to St. John the Evangelist, Avenue 50 Studio, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Open Your Eyes/Abre Los Ojos, The Muckenthaler Cultural Center, Fullerton, CA, USA *Latino Heritage, ChimMaya Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *Resurrected Histories, Avenue 50 Studio, Los Angeles, CA, USA ===2011=== *Top 10 Now, Avant-LA, Los Angeles, CA, USA *The 45 Show, Twenty Miles East Art Gallery, Pomona, CA, USA *Pasteles, Fremont Gallery, Pasadena CA, USA ===2010=== *Words of Paz, Avenue 50 Studio, Highland Park, CA, USA *12\u00d712, ChimMaya Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, USA *El Arte de Los Angeles, Xico Gallery, Arizona, USA *8va.
