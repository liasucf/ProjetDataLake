The first and worst of the explosions took place at the Hotel Copacabana at about 11:30 AM (local time), and killed Fabio di Celmo, a 32-year-old Genoa, Italy, native and resident of Montreal, according to the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome. Di Celmo was visiting Cuba with his father and staying in the hotel. 11 other tourists were also injured in the bombings. The hotels targeted included the Hotel Capri, Hotel Nacional de Cuba, and the Meli\u00e1 Cohiba Hotel.Fox News, 10 February 2011, Cuban Official Details 1997 Hotel Bombings in Posada Carriles Case The Cuban-born Venezuelan Luis Posada Carriles admitted organising the bombings.
