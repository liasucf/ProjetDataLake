    "text": "Under the Dragon's Tail is a 2005 made-for-TV film starring Peter Outerbridge, Matthew MacFadzean, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy, and Flora Montgomery. It was adapted by Janet MacLean from the novel by Maureen Jennings of the same name. ==Plot== This is the third film, introducing the character of William Murdoch and his unique ways of doing detective work. Filming took place in Ontario during September and October 2004. Detective Murdoch investigates the murder of Dolly Capshaw, a mid-wife who, it turns out, was also an abortionist. Using new techniques such as fingerprints (or finger marks as they are known at the time) and handwriting analysis, Murdoch eliminates a number of suspects but has proof that a self-righteous and nosy neighbor, Mr. Golding, was in the house. Missing from Capshaw's desk is her register of clients, a large red book with the image of a dragon on the cover. Murdoch's investigation involves many people whose lives had, in one way or another, crossed with Capshaw's including Ettie Weston, who is no longer a prostitute but is now on the stage with a mentalist act and Maude Pedlow, the wife of a prominent Superior Court judge. Meanwhile, Constable George Crabtree is in training for the Toronto police boxing tournament under the tutelage of Inspector Ramsgate. In this film, Maude Pedlow is played by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy, who went on to portray Dr Julia Ogden in the later TV series starring Yannick Bisson. ==Cast== * Peter Outerbridge - Detective William Murdoch * H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy - Maud Pedlow * Flora Montgomery - Ettie Weston * Matthew MacFadzean - Constable George Crabtree ==DVDs== All three movies were released on DVD in a boxed set on November 11, 2008.
