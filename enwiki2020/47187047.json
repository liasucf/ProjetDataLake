    "text": "The Liao Civilization or Liao River Civilization, named after the Liao river, is an ancient Northeast Asian civilization that originated in the Liao basin. It is thought to have formed in about 6,200 BC. This civilization was discovered when Ryuzo Torii, a Japanese archaeologist, discovered the Hongshan culture in 1908. ==Culture== Large-scale pit-type houses, graves and temples with altars were excavated. It is thought that the Liao civilization may have been \"a country\" of the prehistoric age.University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Regional Lifeways and Cultural Remains in the Northern Corridor: Chifeng International Collaborative Archaeological Research Project.

Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel: Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang, 2006. Ball products such as the jade which made the precursors of Chinese dragon were discovered in remains of Xinglongwa culture. In addition, the oldest pit-comb ware and Liaoning bronze dagger (biwa form bronze sword) were excavated. Since it was contemporaneous with Hwan\u2010huou civilization and Chang Jiang Culture, it is thought to have influenced ancient Chinese culture. ==Environment== This region was thought to have been desert for the past 1 million years. However, a 2015 study found that the region once featured rich aquatic resources and deep lakes and forests that existed from 12,000 years ago to 4,000 years ago. It was changed into desert by climate change which began approximately 4,200 years ago. Therefore, people of the Hongshan culture may have emigrated to the south approximately 4,000 years ago and later influenced Chinese culture.New Thoughts on the Impact of Climate Change in Neolithic China Archaeology\u8a8c\u89e3\u8aac\u8a18\u4e8b ==People== A genetic analysis of human bone remains dating back to 6500 to 2700 BC. in the Liao area, Haplogroup N (Y-DNA) (frequently in Uralic peoples and Yakuts) was observed at 60-100% . == List of cultures == * Xinglongwa culture About 6200 - 5400 BC * Xinle culture About 5200 - 4800 BC * Zhaobaogou culture About 5400 - 4500 BC * Hongshan culture About 4700 - 2900 BC * Lower Xiajiadian culture About 2000 - 1500 BC * Upper Xiajiadian culture About 1100 - 500 BC ==See also== *Yangtze civilization *Yellow river civilization ==References== Category:History of Inner Mongolia Category:Neolithic cultures of China Category:History of Liaoning ",
