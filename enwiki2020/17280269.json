    "text": "\"Cancer\" is a song by American rock band My Chemical Romance. It is the eighth track from the group's third studio album The Black Parade. The album was released on October 23, 2006. ==Composition== The original version of the song is written in the key of E major with a common time tempo of 70 beats per minute. The vocals span from E4 to A5 in the song. A four bar bridge passage prior to the final chorus includes a transposed quotation from the 1958 Buddy Holly hit Raining in My Heart. Its chord progression (featuring a characteristic rising chromatic figure) is highly reminiscent of that from the verse of Raining in My Heart whilst the vocal line closely matches the rhythmic pattern and pitch content of the Bryant and Bryant-penned song. ==Personnel== * Gerard Way \u2013 lead vocals * Bob Bryar \u2013 drums, percussion * Frank Iero \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Ray Toro \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * Mikey Way \u2013 bass, tambourine with * Rob Cavallo \u2013 piano * Jamie Muhoberac \u2013 B3 organ ==Twenty One Pilots cover== American musical duo Twenty One Pilots recorded a cover of \"Cancer\" for British music magazine Rock Sounds 2016 compilation album, Rock Sound Presents: The Black Parade. It was teased by lead singer Tyler Joseph in January 2016, having uploaded a short clip of himself singing the song. The full version was released on September 14, 2016. ===Composition=== The cover is played in the key of D Major with a common time tempo of 72 to 76 beats per minute. The vocals span from D4 to G5 in the song. It contains a piano part and also incorporates programmed beats and other electronic sounds. Rolling Stone described the song as \"synth-laden\" and featuring \"additional lyric reprises and layered vocals, which gives the song an extra pensive vibe.\" === Reception === Althea Legaspi of Rolling Stone wrote that \"the duo stays faithful to the already melancholic song while ratcheting up the somberness a tad.\" Scott Shetler, writing for AXS, wrote that \"Twenty One Pilots keep the melancholy while taking the song in a different direction.\" The lead singer of My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, was impressed by the cover, saying in an interview with PopBuzz \"There's a bit of rejuggling of parts and I was like 'Wow, this almost sounds like a remix,' but it's a cover by way of this, kind of, rearrangement and I was really impressed with it\". Brii Jamieson of Rock Sound named it one of the band's best covers. ===Music video=== On the day of its release, an animated lyric video was uploaded onto the band's YouTube channel. The video shows floating books and large bookshelves in a library. As of May 2020, its lyric video has received over 56 million views.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw6i1SAHetc ===Personnel=== * Tyler Joseph \u2013 vocals, piano, keyboard, synthesizer, bass, programming * Josh Dun \u2013 drums, percussion ===Chart performance=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
