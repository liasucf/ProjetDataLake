    "text": "Avatar Press is an independent American comic book publisher founded in 1996 by William A. Christensen, and based in Rantoul, Illinois. Avatar Press is most notable for publishing Bad Girl comics, such as Faust, Pandora, Hellina, Lookers, The Ravening, and Brian Pulido's Lady Death. Such comics are currently published under the \"Boundless Comics\" imprint. Avatar has a strong web presence, anchored by Warren Ellis' FreakAngels webcomic, as well as the comics news site Bleeding Cool, helmed by Rich Johnston. ==History== Founder and editor-in-chief William A. Christensen. Publisher Christensen had been a freelance contributor to Wizard magazine before founding Avatar Press. The company initially published only limited series. Avatar subsequently expanded to other formats. As part of an effort to expand beyond its reputation as a bad girl publisher, Avatar offered a number of noted creators an opportunity to publish creator-owned books with no content restrictions whatsoever. Among the creators to take Avatar up on its offer were Frank Miller, Warren Ellis, Alan Moore, and Garth Ennis. Lately, the company has taken to licensing comic book adaptations of famous science-fiction and horror movies and television shows, such as Faust: Love of the Damned, RoboCop, Night of the Living Dead, and Friday the 13th. ==Titles== === By author === * Jamie Delano: ** Narcopolis ** Rawbone * Mike Deodato: ** Jade Warriors * Warren Ellis: ** Aetheric Mechanics ** Anna Mercury ** Apparat ** Atmospherics ** Bad Signal ** Bad World ** Blackgas ** Black Summer ** Captain Swing and the Electrical Pirates of Cindery Island ** Cr\u00e9cy ** Dark Blue ** Doktor Sleepless ** Frankenstein's Womb ** FreakAngels ** Gravel ** Ilium ** Ignition City ** No Hero ** Scars ** Supergod ** Wolfskin * Garth Ennis: ** 303 ** Chronicles of Wormwood ** Crossed ** Dicks ** Red Rover Charlie ** Stitched ** Streets of Glory * Christos Gage: ** Absolution * Kieron Gillen: ** The Heat ** \u00dcber * Steven Grant: ** Mortal Souls ** My Flesh is Cool * Jonathan Hickman: ** God Is Dead * David Lapham: ** Caligula ** Dan the Unharmable ** Ferals * Rob Liefeld: ** Avengelyne ** The Coven ** Glory * Mark Millar: ** The Unfunnies * Alan Moore: ** Another Suburban Romance ** Cinema Purgatorio ** The Courtyard ** The Courtyard Companion ** Fashion Beast ** Glory ** Hypothetical Lizard ** Light of Thy Countenance ** Magic Words ** Neonomicon ** Nightjar ** Providence ** A Small Killing ** Writing for Comics ** Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths * Zak Penn: ** Hero Worship * Eric Powell: ** The Goon * Brian Pulido: ** Belladonna ** Gypsy ** Lady Death (of Chaos Comics fame) ** Unholy ** War Angel * John A.
