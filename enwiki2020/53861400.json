Among his screenplays are Demain (2009) and Jo pour Jonathan (2010), directed by Giroux. In meeting with Giroux at cafes to discuss their next project, Giroux said \"we'd see these women and men walking by and we just didn't know anything about them.\" This provided inspiration for their script Felix and Meira. Laferri\u00e8re did much of the research. For the 2014 film, Laferri\u00e8re won Best Screenplay at the Whistler Film Festival, and the Jutra Award for Best Screenplay. ==References== ==External links== *Alexandre Laferri\u00e8re at the Internet Movie Database Category:1973 births Category:Canadian screenwriters Category:Canadian screenwriters in French Category:Living people ",
