    "text": "Benzoic anhydride is the organic compound with the formula (C6H5CO)2O. It is acid anhydride of benzoic acid and the simplest symmetrical aromatic acid anhydride. It is a white solid. ==Preparation and reactions== It is usually prepared by the dehydration reaction of benzoic acid, e.g. using acetic anhydride: :2 C6H5CO2H + (CH3CO)2O \u2192 (C6H5CO)2O + 2 CH3CO2H Alternatively, sodium benzoate can be treated with benzoyl chloride. It can be produced by dehydrating benzoic acid by heating. Benzoic anhydride provides a convenient way to prepare benzoic esters: :(C6H5CO)2O + ROH \u2192 C6H5CO2H + C6H5CO2R ==References== Category:Carboxylic anhydrides ",
