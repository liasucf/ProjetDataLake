    "text": "Edward Waters College is a private college in Jacksonville, Florida. It was founded in 1866 by members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church) as a school to educate freedmen and their children. It was the first independent institution of higher education and the first historically black college in the State of Florida. It continues to be affiliated with the AME Church, and is a member of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida. Image of Bishop Edward Waters ==History== The first African Methodist Episcopal pastor in the state, William G. Steward, originally named the college as Brown Theological Institute. The AME Church was the first independent black denomination in the United States and was founded in 1816 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the Civil War, it sent numerous missionaries to the South to plant AME churches. Charles H. Pearce was also involved in establishing an educational institution for the AME church in Jacksonville. Struggling with some financial difficulties, the school closed for much of the 1870s. It reopened in 1883 as \"East Florida Conference High School\u201d, then changed to \u201cEast Florida Scientific and Divinity High School.\u201d Over the next ten years, the curriculum was expanded. In 1892, the school was renamed for Edward Waters, the third bishop of the AME Church.Davis, Ennis: \"Edward Waters College\", Metro Jacksonville, May 17, 2010 Drawing of John R. Scott and students. A drawing of 1893 shows that the College President at that time was John R. Scott, Sr., first pastor of the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church of Jacksonville, and a member of the Florida Legislature. The original Edward Waters College campus was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1901. By 1904 the college obtained new land and work was started on the new facility. Edward Waters was accredited as a junior college in 1955 under President William B. Stewart and five years later had a restored four-year curriculum. Beginning in 1979 the school was accredited as a four-year institution by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and started awarding bachelor's degrees. ==Academics== Edward Waters College offers bachelor's degrees in eight academic programs including the following: Bachelor of Arts in Communications, Music, Psychology, or Criminal Justice; Bachelor of Science in Biology, Elementary Education or Mathematics; and Bachelor of Business Administration. ===Accreditation=== Beginning in 1979, Edward Waters College (EWC) was accredited as a four-year institution by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS-COC) and was recently fully reaffirmed in 2015. In 2004, Edward Waters College had submitted documents to SACS to support their request for reaccreditation. A Florida Times-Union investigation in October discovered that the EWC documents plagiarized sections of text and statistics from a similar Alabama A&M; University document. The Commission on Colleges voted to drop EWC from membership in SACS, thus revoking the school's accreditation, but the school appealed. A hearing was held in Atlanta during February 2005, and the appeal by Edward Waters College was denied. The school filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction during litigation, which a federal judge granted. The judge ruled that the college could show they were denied due process, and appointed two mediators. In June, the college and SACS agreed to a settlement that allowed the school to remain accredited while re-filing their accreditation documentation. The college's accreditation was reaffirmed in 2006. ==Campus== ===Historic facilities=== ====Centennial Hall==== Centennial Hall, which contains the Obi-Scott-Umunna Collection of African Art, is the oldest building on campus.
