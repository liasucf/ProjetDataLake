The full title was abandoned in 2002, when IPIECA recognized that it no longer accurately reflected the scope of the association\u2019s work. IPIECA's mission is to assist \"the oil and gas industry improve its environmental and social performance\". Company members contribute to IPIECAs budget according to an individually agreed percentage based on the volume of crude oil produced and petroleum products sold by each company and the number of geographical areas where the company has interests. IPIECA is the industry channel into UN's International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UNFCCC, both concerned with climate change. IPIECA promotes an image of an environmental and socially responsible industry, while its members, including BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Repsol and Shell, are among the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas. Its geographical coverage encompasses North America, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and The Caribbean, Africa, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the global market. ==See also== *International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, set up at the same time and in the same place ==References== ==External links== *http://www.ipieca.org *IPIECA reporting table BP Sustainability Report 2016 Category:Lobbying in the United Kingdom Category:Petroleum industry ",
