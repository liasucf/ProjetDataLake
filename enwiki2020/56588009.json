    "text": "Samsung Galaxy S II WiMAX ISW11SC is a smartphone developed by Samsung Electronics, and sold by au in Japan. It is the first phone in the Galaxy series, and is the final model to be compliant with the WiMAX Standard. It supports Wi-Fi tethering. It is one of a series of smartphones compatible with CDMA 1X WIN. Its production model number is SCI 11. The manufacturer's model number is SCH-J001. == Characteristics == It is the first model of Galaxy series to feature near-field communication (NFC). However, it is not compatible with Osaifu-Keitai. The Ver.001 IC card can be used for regular communication, but if it is used for authentication of NFC function, it needs to be replaced with the ver.002 - a card with brown and white stripes. Normal cards that are the size of ver.002 are supported by adding a terminal. The user interface adopts Samsung's original TouchWiz 4.0 UX. The logo (cursive style design) uses a new typeface stamped sequentially from models of 2012 spring model and later including this model. The logo appears immediately after startup and displays the text \"au\". This phone is neither IP67 and IP68 certified which means it is neither water nor dust-proof. The \"KDDI E-mail application\" pre-installed in this model is different from the \"KDDI E-mail application\" installed in the Fall / Winter 2011 model \u00b7 Xperia acro (IS 11 S) \u00b7 HTC EVO WiMAX (ISW 11 HT). A ringtone can be set to something other than preset. == History == * January 16, 2012 (Heisei 24) - Official announcement from KDDI and Samsung Telecommunications Japan.ISW11SC BACK * January 20, 2012 - Noble black is released all over the country. * February 16, 2012 - 1st Software Update Start. * March 24, 2012 - Ceramic White is additionally released in the Chubu area. * March 25, 2012 - Ceramic white is additionally released in the Kanto area. * March 28, 2012 - Ceramic white is additionally released in China, Kyushu, Okinawa area. * March 30, 2012 - Ceramic white is additionally released in the remaining districts other than the above. * May 15, 2012 - Shiny Magenta announced additional. * May 22, 2012 - 2nd Software Update Start. 2012 * July 20 - Shiny Magenta is additionally released at Chubu, Hokuriku, Shikoku and Kyushu areas. * July 21, 2012 - Shiny Magenta is additionally released in Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Kansai and China. * July 25, 2012 - Shiny Magenta is additionally released in the Okinawa area. * August 16, 2012 - 3rd Software Update Start.\u300cGALAXY SII WiMAX ISW11SC\u300d\u306eOS\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u505c\u6b62\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 | 2012\u5e74 | KDDI\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e * September 13, 2012 - 4th Software Update (Version upgrade to Android 4.0.4 begins.) * September 15, 2012 - Because some defects were confirmed in software, we temporarily suspended updates to Android 4.0.4.\u300cGALAXY SII WiMAX ISW11SC\u300d\u306eOS\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u518d\u958b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b | au * October 2, 2012 - Fifth software update (Resume updating to Android 4.0.4.) * February 14, 2013 - 6th software update start. == Main functions / services == * A PC web browser is equipped as standard and Flash contents can be displayed fully.
