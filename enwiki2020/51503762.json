() - \"Un taux de contamination \u00e9norme ! \u00bb, hallucine un prof du coll\u00e8ge Georges-Brassens, en parlant de la moisissure relev\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement.\" The school closed temporarily on Wednesday 8 June 2016 due to a decision from prefectural authorities. Dominique Chauvin, cosecr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du syndicat national des enseignements de second degr\u00e9 de Cr\u00e9teil (Snes), stated that the campus at the time was in poor condition. () The picture says \"Etablissement ferme par decision prefectorale le Mercredi 8 Juin 2016\" meaning \"the school closed due to the prefectural decision on Wednesday 8 June 2016\" In December 2017, a part of the roof in a classroom of the third floor fell, and the teachers decided to apply their \"right of withdrawal\" for asbestos suspicion. The teachers protested several times, asking the Academy and the District for air tests and new buildings. This led the high school students to miss almost two months of class. After many weeks, the Lyc\u00e9e Brassens administration decided to relocate the students in a substitution building in Vitry-Sur-Seine, another city of the district. ==References== ==External links== * Lyc\u00e9e Georges Brassens * http://www.leparisien.fr/val-de- marne-94/villeneuve-le-roi-les-lyceens-de-brassens-transferes-a- vitry-20-01-2018-7512267.php * Articles about the school at 94.citoyens.com * https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/paris-ile-de-france/val-de-marne/val- marne-droit-retrait-enseignants-du-lycee-brassens-villeneuve-roi-1554298.html Category:Lyc\u00e9es in Val-de-Marne ",
