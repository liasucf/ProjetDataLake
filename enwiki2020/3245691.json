The island used to house a leper colony. About 300 patients lived there, nursed by Catholic sisters. It was like a small town, but white patients received better rations than non-whites. In 1925, eight men were brought to Makogai from the New Zealand leper colony on Quail Island. The leper colony operated until the 1960s. ==References== Category:Islands of Fiji Category:Lomaiviti Province Category:Leper colonies Category:Preliminary Register of Sites of National Significance in Fiji ",
