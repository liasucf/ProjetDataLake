Sirene regular illustrators included Tonje Str\u00f8m. The magazine ended publication in 1983. ==References== Category:1973 establishments in Norway Category:1983 disestablishments in Norway Category:Defunct magazines published in Norway Category:Feminism in Norway Category:Feminist magazines Category:Magazines established in 1973 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1983 Category:Magazines published in Oslo Category:Monthly magazines published in Norway Category:Norwegian-language magazines Category:Women's magazines published in Norway ",
