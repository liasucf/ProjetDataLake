    "text": "Eucalyptus bunyip is a rare, slender tree that is endemic to a small area near Tonimbuk in Victoria. It has smooth, light coloured bark, glossy green egg- shaped to broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, club-shaped buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and bell-shaped fruit on a relatively long pedicel. ==Description== Eucalyptus bunyip is a slender tree typically growing to a height of about with smooth, whitish to light brown or yellowish bark with rough corky bark at the base of the trunk. The leaves on young plants are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. Later, intermediate leaves are up to long and wide. Mature trees have large numbers of intermediate leaves in the crown. The adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. They are more or less the same colour on both surfaces. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a thin, delicate peduncle long, about in diameter, the individual buds on a pedicel about the same length as the buds. The mature buds are club-shaped to slightly diamond-shaped, long and wide with a slightly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs in autumn and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, more or less hemispherical capsule up to long and wide on a slender pedicel long. ==Taxonomy and naming== Eucalyptus bunyip was first formally described in 2012 by Kevin James Rule and the description was published in the journal Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Bunyip State Park. The specific epithet (bunyip) is a reference to the type location. ==Distribution and habitat== This eucalypt is a rare tree that grows in the valley floors on the Diamond and Black Snake Creeks in the Bunyip State Park. ==References== Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Trees of Australia bunyip Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 2012 ",
