In the 1980s, he played in several UK 82-style groups. After Discharge founding member Terry Roberts (drums) departed (later joining UK Subs) Ellesmere took the drum chair for the Why EP., a recording which gave the band their first number one on the UK indie charts. Ellesmere did not stay long, and the band replaced him with Gary Maloney. Shortly after he recorded an album as a guitarist for the infamous Earache imprint, he became immersed in the electronic genre. He was inspired by the electronic music coming from Detroit, Berlin and Chicago that were infiltrating the UK in the early 1990s and began his career as an electronic DJ.
