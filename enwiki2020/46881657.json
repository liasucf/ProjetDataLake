    "text": "Buenos Aires al Pac\u00edfico S. A. (abbreviated BAP) was an Argentine company that exploited the operation and infrastructure of the San Mart\u00edn Railway freight rail transport system. BAP operated of cargo in the provinces of Buenos Aires, San Juan, San Luis and Mendoza. The San Mart\u00edn Railway freight service is currently operated by Belgrano Cargas y Log\u00edstica after the Government of Argentina rescinded the contract signed with Am\u00e9rica Latina Log\u00edstica (ALL) in 2013. == History == A train at a level crossing. As part of the railway privatisation carried out during the presidency of Carlos Menem, BAP was granted a concession to operate the San Mart\u00edn freight railway services that had been managed by defunct Ferrocarriles Argentinos since 1949. The company was part of the consortium \"Industrias Metarl\u00fagicas Pescamona\" (IMPSA) that had been also granted the Urquiza Railway system to be operated by sister company \"Ferrocarril Mesopot\u00e1mico-Urquiza\". During its first years of operation (1994) the company carried of cargo. Nevertheless, in 1998, Industrias Metarl\u00fagicas Pescamona (IMPSA), owner of BAP and Ferrocarril Mesopot\u00e1mico (that had been granted concession to operate passenger services), announced that they would retire from the rail transport, selling the 73,5% of BAP and the 70,5% of FM to Brazilian company Ferrov\u00eda Sul Atl\u00e1ntico (FSA). Nevertheless, the Government of Argentina, owner of the entire railway network granted in concession, did not allow the operation due to the failure of IMPSA to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract of concession, with unpaid charges for over A$ 130 million. In 2000, the operation of San Mart\u00edn Railway line was taken over by \"ALL Central\", a subdivision of Brazilian company Am\u00e9rica Latina Log\u00edstica. ==References== Category:Defunct railway companies of Argentina Category:Railway companies established in 1993 Category:5 ft 6 in gauge railways in Argentina Category:Railway companies disestablished in 2000 ",
