    "text": "The Burj Mubarak al-Kabir is a proposed megatall skyscraper in Kuwait City, Kuwait. It will be part of the future city called Madinat al-Hareer. Expected completion is likely to be around in 2030. If built, it would become the world's tallest building, surpassing the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Its height is in order to reflect the folk tale collection One Thousand and One Arabian Nights If built, the tower would be the tallest skyscraper in Kuwait, surpassing Al Hamra Tower. Skyscrapers do not normally exceed 80 floors due to the amount of space that would be taken up by elevators. However, the Mubarak al-Kabir Tower would consist of a far greater number of floors. This would necessitate double or triple-decker elevators. Another challenge would be posed by the immense height of the building, which makes it vulnerable to high winds. In order to cope with these winds, the tower is designed as three interlocking towers, each twisting 45 degrees to help stabilize it. In addition, vertical ailerons will run the full length of the building on each edge. Adjustments to the positions of these ailerons will redirect the winds in order to minimize structural vibrations. The building will include seven vertically stacked 30-story 'neighborhoods\", including apartments, offices, and hotels. Linking the neighborhoods will be several four-story \"town squares.\" The planned height of the building is taller than the current tallest building in the world, the 828 m Burj Khalifa ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Kuwait ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Kuwait Category:Buildings and structures in Kuwait City Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Kuwait ",
