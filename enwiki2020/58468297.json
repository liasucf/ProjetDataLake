Healy further explained \"It\u2019s about when you are a young person and you struggle sometimes to figure out what you really want. And sometimes, like a lot of things, it requires you to make a mistake before you actually understand what you have.\" Healy described Nick Drake as an influence for the song. == Critical reception == Writing for PopBuzz, Katie Louise Smith called \"Be My Mistake\" \"is almost like an even sadder sequel to 'Somebody Else' and it will one hundred percent destroy you emotionally\". == Charting == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u201319) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} == References == == External links == * Official Acoustic Video Category:2018 songs Category:The 1975 songs Category:Songs written by Matthew Healy Category:Folk rock songs ",
