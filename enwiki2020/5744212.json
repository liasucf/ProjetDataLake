    "text": "LRC (short for LyRiCs) is a computer file format that synchronizes song lyrics with an audio file, such as MP3, Vorbis or MIDI. When an audio file is played with certain music players on a computer or on modern digital audio players, the song lyrics are displayed. The lyrics file generally has the same name as the audio file, with a different filename extension. For example, song.mp3 and song.lrc. The LRC format is text-based and similar to subtitle files. == Formats == === Simple format === Simple LRC format was introduced by Taiwan- based Kuo (Djohan) Shiang-shiang's Lyrics Displayer. It was one of the first programs, if not the first, that attempted to simulate Karaoke performance. It usually displays a whole line of lyrics, but it is possible to display a word at a time, such as one would see in modern Karaoke machines, by creating a time tag for each word rather than each line. Kuo's Lyrics Displayer was created in 1998 and was accompanied with a plug-in for Winamp.https://web.archive.org/web/19990129022949/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/tricky/483/vislyric.html The Line Time Tags are in the format [mm:ss.xx] where mm is minutes, ss is seconds and xx is hundredths of a second. * Normal example: [00:12.00]Line 1 lyrics [00:17.20]Line 2 lyrics [00:21.10]Line 3 lyrics ... [mm:ss.xx]last lyrics line ID Tags may appear before the lyrics,http://www.mobile- mir.com/en/HowToLRC.php (dead, but archived) although some players may not recognize or simply ignore this.

The ability to change and specify the gender of the lyrics by using M: Male, F: Female, D: Duet. * Example: [00:12.00]Line 1 lyrics [00:17.20]F: Line 2 lyrics [00:21.10]M: Line 3 lyrics [00:24.00]Line 4 lyrics [00:28.25]D: Line 5 lyrics [00:29.02]Line 6 lyrics Let's say we use blue for male, red for female and pink for Duet. Line 1 using the default color (blue) when no tag is found. Line 2 lyrics start with red when F: is found. Line 3 lyrics start with blue when M: is found. Line 4 lyrics stays blue when no tag is found. Line 5 lyrics start with pink when D: is found. Line 6 lyrics stays pink when no tag is found. === Enhanced format === Enhanced LRC format is an extension of Simple LRC Format developed by the designer of A2 Media Player. The differences: * The line timestamp is the end of the previous word. ** This allows LRC players to determine the duration of the previous word, and when to display the next line. * Adds a Word Time Tag in the format: <mm:ss.xx>. Format example: [mm:ss.xx] line 1 word 1 line 1 word 2 ... line 1 last word [mm:ss.xx] line 2 word 1 line 2 word 2 ... line 2 last word ... [mm:ss.xx] last line word 1 last line word 2 ... last line last word Example of an Enhanced LRC file: [ar: Jefferson Airplane] [al: Surrealistic Pillow] [au: Jefferson Airplane] [length: 2:58] [by: lrc-maker] [ti: Somebody to Love] [00:00.00] <00:00.04> When <00:00.16> the <00:00.82> truth <00:01.29> is <00:01.63> found <00:03.09> to <00:03.37> be <00:05.92> lies [00:06.47] <00:07.67> And <00:07.94> all <00:08.36> the <00:08.63> joy <00:10.28> within <00:10.53> you <00:13.09> dies [00:13.34] <00:14.32> Don't <00:14.73> you <00:15.14> want <00:15.57> somebody <00:16.09> to <00:16.46> love == Support == === Hardware === * Huawei's Standard Music Player * Xiaomi's Standard Music Player * Meizu's M3 Music CardMeizu: M3 Music Card and M6 Mini Player * Creative Labs' MuVo V100 * Archos 5, when LRC file found with the same name as the song * Rockbox compatible devices.
