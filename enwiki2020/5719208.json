    "text": "The original marker for the 45\u00d790 point in North America; the sign was later amended to explain that the real location is actually approximately behind and to the left of the marker on the ground. Close up of the incorrectly placed marker in Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States The 45\u00d790 points are the four points on Earth which are halfway between the geographical poles, the equator, the Prime Meridian, and the 180th meridian. ==45\u00b0N, 90\u00b0W== The best- known and most frequently visited such point is which is located on land at above sea level in the town of Rietbrock, Wisconsin near the unincorporated community of Poniatowski. An incorrect geographic marker was placed there by the Marathon County Park Commission, but in 2017, it was removed and relocated to the actual location. It re-opened September 12, 2017. The point has become something of a pop culture phenomenon thanks to Gesicki's Tavern in the tiny cluster of establishments in Poniatowski. They once sold 45\u00d790 T-shirts and registered visitors as members of the \"45x90 Club\". Since 2006, the Wausau/Central Wisconsin Convention & Visitors Bureau has been the holder of the official \"45x90 Club\" registration book. The book is on loan from the Gesicki family. Upon becoming a member of the \"45x90 Club\", the Wausau/Central Wisconsin Convention & Visitors Bureau will give new members a commemorative coin. ==45\u00b0N, 90\u00b0E== The only other 45\u00d790 point located on land is , which is at an elevation of above sea level. This point is located in a desolate region of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, near the Mongolian border, approximately northeast of \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. Administratively, it is on the border of Qitai and Qinggil Counties. Greg Michaels, an American, and Ru Rong Zhao, a taxi driver from the closest town of Qitai, itself 110 km to the south- southwest, visited this point on April 13, 2004 and documented the visit on the Degree Confluence Project. Their visit found no monument or any physical recognition of the status and documented that the nearest community to the site documented on maps, Jiangjunmiao, had long since been abandoned. ==45\u00b0S, 90\u00b0E== The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was near the coordinate 45\u00b0S, 90\u00b0E. The coordinate is closest to the red dot labeled as Gaofen 1 at the bottom, halfway between the center and left side of the image. Located in the southern Indian Ocean, has an ocean floor depth of below sea level and is southeast of the nearest uninhabited island of \u00cele Saint-Paul, northeast of Elephant Spit on Heard Island, east north east of Port aux Fran\u00e7ais in the Kerguelen Islands, north of Antarctica, southwest of the closest inhabited land of Augusta, Western Australia, southeast of R\u00e9union Island, and southeast of Benguerra Island, Mozambique, and southeast of Mossel Bay, South Africa. In March 2014, the location in the southern Indian Ocean was the subject of an aerial search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, after potential debris were spotted by satellite centered on the 45\u00b0S, 90\u00b0E location. == 45\u00b0S, 90\u00b0W== Located in the southern Pacific Ocean, west south west of Guaitecas in Chile, and north of Antarctica, has an ocean floor depth of below sea level. ==Antipodes == Each 45x90 point is the antipode - the point on the opposite side of the each - of another 45x90 point. The southern Indian Ocean location and the point in Wisconsin are antipodes of each other. The southern Pacific Ocean location and the point in China are antipodes of each other. ==See also== *Degree Confluence Project (DCP) *45th parallel north *45th parallel south *90th meridian east *90th meridian west == References == ==External links== *The 45th Parallel, Poniatowski, Wisconsin *Visit to the 45X90 point in Wisconsin (DCP) *Visit to the 45X90 point in northwestern China (DCP) Category:Cartography Category:Geography of Marathon County, Wisconsin Category:Geography of Wisconsin Category:Geography of Xinjiang Category:Indian Ocean Category:Lists of coordinates Category:Navigation Category:Pacific Ocean Category:Tourist attractions in Marathon County, Wisconsin ",
