    "text": "Don't Get Mad Get Money is a second studio album by American hardcore rapper Fredro Starr, best known as a member of multi-platinum hardcore rap group Onyx, released on May 20, 2003 by D3 Entertainment. The album was produced by Kronic Tones, Porky, Fredro Starr, Hector Delgado and Ess. The album features appearances by American rappers Sticky Fingaz, X1, Begetz, Still Livin' and Dirty Get-Inz. The album debuted at number 99 on the US Top R&B;/Hip Hop Albums chart on June 14, 2003. The album was released on D3 Entertainment, owned by the label Riviera Entertainment. ==Critical response== Donnie Kwak of Vibe gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying \"...After lukewarm responses to his solo debut, \"Firestarr\", and last year's forgettable Onyx reunion, \"Bacdafucup Part II\", Fredro Starr tries his hand at more radio friendly step-alongs on \"Don't Get Mad Get Money\". Songs like \"Finer Things\", with its Ashanti-like chorus, and \"California Girls\", which mimics the Neptunes down to the falsetto crooning on the hook, expose the overtly pop direction. Starr's flow, however, remains polished (along with protege Icarus's). But after the production retreads and the tired threats and punch lines, \"Don't Get Mad... doesn't get even.\" Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave the album seven stars out of ten, and stated \"...Last time around Fredro Starr tried to do his own production, but this time he wisely passes the torch to cats like Porky and Kronic Tones. Never heard of them? You'll get to know the latter from his Just Blaze/Kanye West style work on \"Pranksta,\" his melodic grit on \"All Out\" featuring Sticky Fingaz and X1, the smoothed out title track and the ominous \"Reaper's Anthem.\" Porky's work on \"California Girls\" shines, but he also handles the bouncy flute of \"Finer Things\" nicely and still blasts it out for the streets on \"Timberlands,\" Fredro's free advertisement for his favorite kicks.\" == Singles == The one and only single, \"California Girls\" featuring Dirty Get-inz and Felisa Marisol was released on May 6, 2003. The video shows some kind of party near the pool. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # ! track ! featured guest(s) ! producer(s) ! length |- | 01. | \"Man Up\" | Dirty Get-Inz, X1 | Kronic Tones | 3:22 |- | 02. | \"Dangerous\" | Still Livin' | Ess | 2:36 |- | 03. | \"California Girls\" | Dirty Get-Inz, Felisa Marisol | Porky | 3:46 |- | 04. | \"Rambo\" | T Hussle | Kronic Tones | 2:53 |- | 05. | \"Finer Things\" | | Porky | 2:44 |- | 06. | \"Just Like That\" | | Kronic Tones | 3:13 |- | 07. | \"Yo Mike (Skit)\" | | Kronic Tones | 1:22 |- | 08. | \"Funtime\" | | Ess | 3:41 |- | 9. | \"All Out\" | Begetz, Sticky Fingaz, X1 | Kronic Tones | 2:24 |- | 10. | \"Timberlands\" | | Porky | 3:33 |- | 11. | \"Where's The Love\" | | Fredro Starr, Hector Delgado | 3:02 |- | 12. | \"Don't Get Mad, Get Money\" | X1 | Kronic Tones | 2:46 |- | 13. | \"Reaper's Anthem (Torque)\" | | Kronic Tones | 2:41 |- | 14. | \"California Girls (Remix)\" | Dirty Get-Inz, Felisa Marisol | M3 | 3:56 |- |} == Personnel == Credits for Don't Get Mad Get Money adapted from AllMusic and CD booklet.Don't Get Mad Get Money credits adapted from the AllMusic reviewCredits for Fredro Starr - Don't Get Mad Get Money * Fredro Starr \u2014 performer, vocals, producer (\"Where's The Love\"), executive producer * Sticky Fingaz \u2014 guest artist, executive producer * X1 \u2014 guest artist * David \u00abBegetz\u00bb Cooper \u2014 guest artist * Dirty Get-Inz \u2014 guest artist * Still Livin' \u2014 backing vocals * T Hussle \u2014 backing vocals * Felisa Marisol \u2014 backing vocals * Kronic Tones \u2014 producer * Porky \u2014 producer * Ess \u2014 producer * Omar \u00abIceman\u00bb Sharif \u2014 executive producer * Hector Delgado \u2014 recording, mixing, producer (\"Where's The Love\") * Jonathan Mannion \u2014 photographer * Debra Young \u2014 photographer * Brian Porizek \u2014 art direction, design * Aldy Damian \u2014 label direction * M3 \u2014 remix ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
