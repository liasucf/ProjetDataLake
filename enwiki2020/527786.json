Pulse is related to and distinguished from rhythm (grouping), beats, and meter: ==Definitions== Metric levels: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below. drum pattern, rock drum kit. Despite the presence of eighth notes, there is a quarter note beat. The pulse may be audible or implied. The tempo of the piece is the speed of the pulse. If a pulse becomes too fast it would become a drone; one that is too slow would be perceived as unconnected sounds. When the period of any continuous beat is faster than 8\u201310 per second or slower than 1 per 1.5\u20132 seconds, it cannot be perceived as such.P. Fraisse, Les Structures Rhythmiques, Erasme Paris 1956, H Woodrow Time Perception in \"A Handbook of Experimental Psychology\", ed. S.S. Stevens, Wiley, NY 1951, both quoted at http://www.zeuxilogy.home.ro/media/manifesto.pdf (zeuxilogy.home.ro ) \"Musical\" pulses are generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute. The pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as basic. This is currently most often designated as a crotchet or quarter note when written (see time signature). ==Pulse groups== Clear quarter note pulse in at a tempo of =120 . At =600 the pulse becomes a drone , while at =30 the pulse becomes disconnected sounds . While ideal pulses are identical, when pulses are variously accented, this produces two- or three-pulse pulse groups such as strong-weak and strong-weak-weak and any longer group may be broken into such groups of two and three. In fact there is a natural tendency to perceptually group or differentiate an ideal pulse in this way. A repetitive, regularly accented pulse-group is called a metre. Varied pulse groups equals non- isochronal multiple level . Pulses can occur at multiple metric levels - see figure. Pulse groups may be distinguished as synchronous, if all pulses on slower levels coincide with those on faster levels, and nonsynchronous, if not. An isochronal or equally spaced pulse on one level that uses varied pulse groups (rather than just one pulse group the whole piece) create a pulse on the (slower) multiple level that is non-isochronal (a stream of 2+3... at the eighth note level would create a pulse of a quarter note+dotted quarter note as its multiple level). ==See also== * Composite rhythm * Metre (hymn) * Metre (poetry) * Triple metre * Duple and quadruple metre * Sextuple metre * Counting (music) ==Sources== Category:Rhythm and meter ",
