    "text": "Denali in Alaska is the highest mountain peak of the United States and North America. Denali is the third most topographically prominent and third most topographically isolated summit on Earth after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. The following sortable table comprises the 65 ultra-prominent summits of the U.S. State of Alaska. Each of these peaks has at least of topographic prominence. Topographic elevation is the vertical distance above the reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface. The topographic prominence of a summit is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key col to a higher summit. The topographic isolation of a summit is the minimum great-circle distance to a point of equal elevation. This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least of topographic prominence. An ultra-prominent summit is a summit with at least of topographic prominence. There are 126 ultra-prominent summits in the United States. If an elevation or prominence is calculated as a range of values, the arithmetic mean is shown. ==Ultra-prominent summits== Of the 126 ultra-prominent summits of the United States, the following 65 (or 52%) rise in Alaska. Four of these peaks lie on the international border with Yukon and two lie on the international border with British Columbia. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+The 65 ultra-prominent summits of Alaska !Rank !Mountain Peak !Mountain Range !Elevation !Prominence !Isolation !Location |- |align=center|1 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|2 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|3 |Wrangell Mountains | |- |align=center|4 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|5 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|6 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|7 |Unimak Island | |- |align=center|8 |Chigmit Mountains | |- |align=center|9 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|10 |Alaska Peninsula | |- |align=center|11 |Alaska Peninsula | |- |align=center|12 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|13 |Brooks Range | |- |align=center|14 |Chigmit Mountains | |- |align=center|15 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|16 |Wrangell Mountains | |- |align=center|17 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|18 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|19 |Alaska Peninsula | |- |align=center|20 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|21 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|22 |Umnak Island | |- |align=center|23 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|24 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|25 |Wrangell Mountains | |- |align=center|26 |Aleutian Range | |- |align=center|27 |Aleutian Range | |- |align=center|28 |Alaska Peninsula | |- |align=center|29 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|30 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|31 |Unimak Island | |- |align=center|32 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|33 |Brooks Range | |- |align=center|34 |Coast Mountains | |- |align=center|35 |Kenai Mountains | |- |align=center|36 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|37 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|38 |Tanaga Island | |- |align=center|39 |Unalaska Island | |- |align=center|40 |Talkeetna Mountains | |- |align=center|41 |Unimak Island | |- |align=center|42 |Kenai Mountains | |- |align=center|43 |Aleutian Range | |- |align=center|44 |Great Sitkin Island | |- |align=center|45 |Chuginadak Island | |- |align=center|46 |Wrangell Mountains | |- |align=center|47 |Coast Mountains | |- |align=center|48 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|49 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|50 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|51 |Baranof Island | |- |align=center|52 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|53 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|54 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|55 |Carlisle Island | |- |align=center|56 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|57 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|58 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|59 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|60 |Gareloi Island | |- |align=center|61 |Alaska Range | |- |align=center|62 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|63 |Chugach Mountains | |- |align=center|64 |Saint Elias Mountains | |- |align=center|65 |Atka Island | |} ==Gallery== Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|1Denali is the highest mountain peak of the State of Alaska, the United States of America, and all of North America.
