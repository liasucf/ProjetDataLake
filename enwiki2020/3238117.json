She has won two Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actress, for Pet Pyaar Aur Paap (1985) and Beta (1993), and has been nominated for a total of ten awards, holding a record for the most nominations in the category. In January 2012, Irani was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award at the 57th Filmfare Awards. ==Early life== Aruna Irani was born in Mumbai, India to an Irani father and a Hindu mother. Her father Faredun Irani ran a drama troupe, and her mother Saguna was an actress. She is the eldest of eight siblings, and gave up studies after sixth standard because her family did not have enough money to educate all the children. She claims to have learnt dancing while working in the films because she could not afford professional training from a master. Her brothers Indra Kumar, Adi Irani and Firoz Irani are all associated with the film industry. Actress Bindu is her cousin. ==Career== Aruna Irani made her debut in the movie Ganga Jamna (1961) playing Azra's childhood character. She then acted in the movie Anpadh (1962) as Mala Sinha's childhood character. She next did several small roles in films such as Jahanara (1964), Farz (1967), Upkar (1967) and Aaya Sawan Jhoomke (1969). She later acted with comedian Mehmood Ali in films such as Aulad (1968), Humjoli (1970), Devi (1970) and Naya Zamana (1971). In 1971, she starred in Caravan. She later starred in Mehmood Ali's Bombay To Goa (1972), Garam Masala (1972) and Do Phool (1973). Her films have included Farz (1967), Bobby (1973), Fakira (1976), Sargam (1979), Red Rose (1980), Love Story (1981), and Rocky (1981). She won her first Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for Pet Pyaar Aur Paap (1984). In the late 1980s and 1990s Irani switched to playing motherly roles, notably in Beta (1992), for which she won her second Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. She acted in the Kannada remake of the same film with the same role. Some of her Marathi films are Aandhla Marto Dola, Bhingari, Changu Mangu, Lapwa Chapvi, Ek Gadi Baki Anadi, Mitwaa and Bol Baby Bol. In her later career, Irani also switched to television, performing character roles in various serials.
