    "text": "Police station (set of Zenigata Heiji, Toei Uzumasa Studios, Kyoto). Monument to Hachigor\u014d, Kanda My\u014djin. is a Japanese fictional character, the hero of a series of Japanese novels, films and TV programmes set in the Edo period (1603\u20131868) of Japanese history. He is a policeman (\u5ca1\u3063\u5f15\u304d, okappiki) who catches criminals by throwing coins, the zeni of the title, thus Zenigata Heiji. The hero was created by novelist Kod\u014d Nomura (\u91ce\u6751\u80e1\u5802, Nomura Kod\u014d) in 1931. Heiji's beat is My\u014djin-shita, \"beneath the (Kanda) My\u014djin shrine\". ==Situation== The hero, Heiji, lives with his wife Oshizu. His sidekick is Hachigor\u014d (\u516b\u4e94\u90ce), also known as Karappachi or just Hachi. He uses deduction, a jutte, and old-fashioned coins with a hole, called kan'eits\u016bh\u014d (\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d), as weapons to catch criminals. ==Novels== The original series of stories ran from 1937 to 1959. The first story was published in the Japanese magazine Bungei Shunj\u016b \u014cru Yomimono-han (all story edition). In all, 383 stories were produced. Many are still in print in Japan today. ==Historical accuracy== Zenigata Heiji is a fictional story, and is not based on any real individual. It is not made clear in which part of the Edo period the stories are set. The description of the okappiki in Zenigata Heiji differs from reality on several points. Okappiki were unpaid, or received a very small amount of money. Zenigata Heiji is depicted as a full-time policeman with no other job. In reality, this would have been impossible. Further, the \"jutte\" that Heiji usually carries was only issued to okappiki when the severity of an incident called for it. In the TV series, Heiji carries his jutte in his belt; however, the jutte was actually carried in a pocket. The style of the jutte is also unrealistic. == Films == Films about Zenigata Heiji include: * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u632f\u8896\u6e90\u592a (1931) * \u4e03\u4eba\u306e\u82b1\u5ac1 * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5bcc\u7c56\u653f\u8ac7 (1933) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5fa9\u8b90\u9b3c (1933) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u7d05\u84ee\u5730\u7344 (1934) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u6fe1\u308c\u305f\u5343\u4e21\u7bb1 (1935) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 (1939) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8a71 \u540d\u6708\u795e\u7530\u796d (1939) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5e73\u6b21\u306e\u5973\u96e3 (1939) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5357\u86ee\u79d8\u6cd5\u7b8b (1940) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5e73\u6b21\u516b\u767e\u516b\u753a (1949) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21 (1951) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u604b\u6587\u9053\u4e2d (1951) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u5730\u7344\u306e\u9580 (1952) * \u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21\u6355\u7269\u63a7 \u304b\u3089\u304f\u308a\u5c4b\u6577 (1953) * (\u5929\u6674\u308c\u4e00\u756a\u624b\u67c4 \u9752\u6625\u92ad\u5f62\u5e73\u6b21 ...

Hashiz\u014d \u014cgawa is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest running actor in a one-hour long television series for his performance as Heiji.

It is stated in the first episode of the first season that he is a descendant of Zenigata Heiji. * Zenigata Heiji is mentioned in the anime Ryusei no Rockman. * In the Final Fantasy series, the Zeninage skill (alternately translated as MoneyThrow, GP Toss, or Takeover) consists of throwing coins at the target for damage. The skill was introduced in Final Fantasy V as a technique of the Samurai job. Final Fantasy VI requires that the \"Heiji's Jitte\" item be equipped to unlock this ability. * In the video game Sekiro the main character can throw coins at his enemies. Since the game is about Samurai, this is probably both a reference to Zenigata Heiji and the Samurai job from the aforementioned Final Fantasy series. * Zenigata Heiji is highlighted in volume 8 of the Detective Conan manga's edition of \"Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library, a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. Heiji is also the given name of one of the series' major characters, Heiji Hattori. * in Ken akumatsu's Mahou Sensei Negima manga, Zenigata Heiji is referenced during the fight between Mana Tatsumiya and Ku Fei, when the former uses coins to attack the latter. * in a chapter of Urusei Yatsura, Ataru remembers to be Heiji Zenigata upon picking up a jitte. ==See also== *Jidaigeki, Japanese period dramas *:ja:\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d, the Japanese Wikipedia article on kan'eits\u016bh\u014d gives images of the original coins. *Japanese mon (currency), the Japanese currency represented by the kan'eits\u016bh\u014d. == References == == External links == * Films and TV series about Zenigata Heiji Heiji, Zenigata Category:Literary characters introduced in 1931 ",
