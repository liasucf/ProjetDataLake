Since 2011, TwentyWonder events have been hosted by the Los Angeles Derby Dolls at their venue, \"The Doll Factory\". Event lineups consist of several dozen local, alternative cultural attractions. Those attractions typically include women's roller derby, national and international music acts, science exhibits, makers, magicians, comedians, and circus performers. ==Down Syndrome Education and Fundraising== TwentyWonder serves as a fundraiser and awareness event for the Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles (DSALA). From 2010\u20132014, TwentyWonder events raised over $400,000 for DSALA. Each event integrates people with Down syndrome into its lineup.
