Milan. ==Club career== ===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid=== Born in Marseille, Hernandez joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's academy in 2007, aged nine. After progressing through the youth categories, he was promoted to the reserves in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n in summer 2015. On 3 February 2016, Hernandez renewed his contract. Two days later, he was called up to the first team for a La Liga match against Eibar due to injuries, but remained an unused substitute in the 3\u20131 home win. ===Alav\u00e9s=== On 4 August 2016, Hernandez extended his contract until 2021, being immediately loaned to fellow league club Deportivo Alav\u00e9s for one year. He made his professional debut late in the month, starting in a 0\u20130 home draw with Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. On 16 October 2016, Hernandez was given a straight red card in a 1\u20131 home draw to M\u00e1laga after a hard tackle on Ignacio Camacho. He scored his first professional goal the following 7 May, netting the game's only in a home victory over Athletic Bilbao. A regular starter during the Basque team's run in the Copa del Rey, Hernandez helped them reach the final for the first time in their 91-year history. During the decisive match on 27 May 2017, he scored the equaliser through a direct free kick in an eventual 1\u20133 loss against Barcelona. ===Real Madrid=== On 5 July 2017, Hernandez signed a six-year deal with Real Madrid after they met his release clause of \u20ac24 million. He made his competitive debut on 16 August, replacing Marco Asensio in a 2\u20130 home win against Barcelona for that year's Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a. Hernandez made three appearances during the 2017\u201318 edition of the UEFA Champions League, helping the club win its third consecutive and 13th overall title in the competition. On 10 August 2018, he was loaned to Real Sociedad. ===Milan=== On 7 July 2019, Hernandez joined Serie A club A.C. Milan in a deal worth maximum of \u20ac20 million. The transfer was approved and carried out by Paolo Maldini, who met with him informally in Ibiza to persuade him to join. Hernandez made his official debut on 21 September 2019, playing 18 minutes in the 2\u20130 defeat against Inter Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. He scored his first goal for the Rossoneri on 5 October, helping the visitors come from behind to win 2\u20131 at Genoa. ==Personal life== Hernandez's father, Jean- Fran\u00e7ois, was also a footballer. A central defender of Spanish descent, he too played for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; his older brother, Lucas, also a defender, was also developed at the club. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B |2015\u201316 |Tercera Divisi\u00f3n |9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||10||0 |- |Alav\u00e9s (loan) |2016\u201317 |La Liga |32||1||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||38||2 |- |Real Madrid |2017\u201318 |La Liga |13||0||6||0||3||0||1||0||23||0 |- |Real Sociedad (loan) |2018\u201319 |La Liga |24||1||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Milan |2019\u201320 |Serie A |33||6||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||36||7 |- |2020\u201321 |Serie A |4||1||0||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !37!!7!!3!!1!!3!!0!!0!!0!!43!!8 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !115||9||19||2||6||0||2||0||142||11 |} ==Honours== Alav\u00e9s *Copa del Rey runner-up: 2016\u201317 Real Madrid *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2017 *UEFA Champions League: 2017\u201318 *UEFA Super Cup: 2017 *FIFA Club World Cup: 2017 Individual *A.C.
