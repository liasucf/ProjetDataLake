Head coach Babe Hollingbery led the team to a 1\u20133\u20131 mark in the PCC and 3\u20133\u20132 overall. During the Homecoming tie against Palouse neighbor Idaho on Friday, November 11, Governor Roland Hartley presented a cougar cub to the WSC students. The cub was originally to be called \"Governor Hartley,\" in honor of its donor. The governor gracefully declined and suggested the name \"Butch,\" in honor of senior quarterback Herbert \"Butch\" Meeker of Spokane. ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Opponent ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | Attendance |- ! scope=\"row\" | September 24 | Mt.
