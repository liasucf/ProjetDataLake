    "text": "The Canon P (P for Populaire) was a rangefinder camera produced by Canon Inc., compatible with the Leica M39 screw mount (LTM). It was introduced in March 1959 and was marketed as a low-cost sister to the Canon VI-L. A black version was also introduced, which today is quite rare. The Canon P is the predecessor to the Canon 7 rangefinder. ==External links== * Canon P at the Canon Camera Museum Category:Canon rangefinder cameras Category:Leica thread-mount cameras Category:Products introduced in 1959 ",
