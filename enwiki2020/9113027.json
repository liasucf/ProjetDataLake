    "text": "Simeon ben Helbo Kara was a French rabbi who lived in Mans in the 11th century; brother of Menahem ben \u1e24elbo and father of Joseph \u1e32ara. For the meaning of his surname see Joseph \u1e32ara. Isaac de Lattes, in his \u1e32iryat Sefer, counts \u1e32ara among the prominent French rabbis, although no work of his has survived. J.L. Rapoport identified him with the compiler of the Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Shim'oni, on account of the similarity of some Midrashic quotations in this work with citations in Rashi's Bible commentary. Abraham Epstein has, however, shown that in the manuscripts the name \"\u1e32ara\" does not occur, and in place of \"Simeon\" the reading \"Simson\" at times is found. == Sources == Its bibliography: Zunz, G.
