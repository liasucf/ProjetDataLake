Seven decades on, as their cinema projectors crumble and film reels become scarce, their patrons are lured by slick digital technology. A benevolent showman, a shrewd exhibitor and a maverick projector mechanic bear a beautiful burden - to keep the last travelling cinemas of the world running. == Film festivals == The Cinema Travellers had its world premiere on May 15, 2016 at the Salle Bu\u00f1uel in the Palais des Festival at 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Following that, the film has been invited to play at 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and 2016 New York Film Festival, becoming the only Indian documentary film to achieve this rare trifecta of topmost film festivals. {| class=\"wikitable\" |Cannes Film Festival |May 2016 |Official Selection (Winner) |- |Sydney Film Festival |June 2016 |Official Selection |- |Toronto International Film Festival |Sep 2016 |Official Selection |- |Batumi International Art House Film Festival |Sep 2016 |Winner |- |Vilnius Documentary Film Festival |Sep 2016 |Opening Film |- |New York Film Festival |Oct 2016 |Official Selection |- |New Hampshire Film Festival |Oct 2016 |Winner |- |Busan International Film Festival |Oct 2016 |Official Selection |- |Mumbai Film Festival |Oct 2016 |Winner |- |Guelph Film Festival |Nov 2016 |Opening Film |- |Canberra International Film Festival |Nov 2016 |Closing Film |- |Hawaii International Film Festival |Nov 2016 |Winner |- |Denver Film Festival |Nov 2016 |Official Selection |- |International Documentary Festival of Amsterdam |Nov 2016 |Official Selection |- |Anchorage International Film Festival |Dec 2016 |Winner |- |Dubai International Film Festival |Dec 2016 |Official Selection |- |Kochi Biennale, Artist's Cinema |Dec 2016 |Opening Film |- |G\u00f6teborg Film Festival |Jan 2017 |Official Selection |- |Docedge |Feb 2017 |Opening Film |- |CPH:DOX |Mar 2017 |Artists and Auteurs |- |Chiayi International Art Doc Film Festival |Mar 2017 |Past at Present |- |Ljubljana Doc Film Festival |Mar 2017 |Closing Film |- |DOC10 |Apr 2017 |Ten essential documentary gems |- |Royal Anthropological Institute Film Festival |Apr 2017 |Winner |- |Festival International de Films de Fribourg |Apr 2017 |A cinematic cabinet of curiosities |} == Reception == The Cinema Travellers premiered at Cannes Film Festival to a rousing response.
