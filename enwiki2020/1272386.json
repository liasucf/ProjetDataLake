    "text": "The Greco Defence (or McConnell Defense), named after Gioachino Greco (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1634), is a chess opening beginning with the moves: :1. e4 e5 :2. Nf3 Qf6 The opening is categorized as ECO code C40. ==Discussion== Of the several plausible ways Black has to defend his e-pawn, 2...Qf6 is considered one of the weaker choices, since the queen is developed prematurely and can become a target for attack. Also, the black knight on g8 is deprived of its most natural square. There is, however, no obvious refutation of this opening; White's advantage consists mainly of being able to develop more smoothly. Although it is a popular opening choice by novice players, it has also been used by players who, according to International Master Gary Lane, \"should know better\". ==Examples== ===Greco line=== Greco himself illustrated the following amusing line against this defense in 1620: 1\\. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6?! 3. Bc4 Qg6 4. 0-0 Qxe4 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 :5...Kxf7?? 6.Ng5+ wins the black queen. 6\\. Re1 Qf4 7. Rxe5+ Kxf7 :7...Kd8 8.Re8# 8\\. d4 Qf6 9. Ng5+ Kg6 10. Qd3+ Kh6 11. Nf7# 1\u20130Opening Lanes Gary Lane, Chesscafe.com, 2001, last question on the page. ===McConnell game=== Morphy vs. McConnell, New Orleans 1849: 1\\. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Nc3 c6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Qg6 6. Bd3 :6.Qxd4! gives White a big lead in development. 6... Qxg2 7. Rg1 Qh3 8. Rg3 Qh5 9. Rg5 Qh3 10. Bf1 Qe6 11.
