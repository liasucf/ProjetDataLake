    "text": "Room Full of Spoons is a 2016 Canadian documentary film directed by Rick Harper about the 2003 cult film The Room. After a brief theatrical run in April 2016, the documentary was quickly pulled when independent theaters reported receiving legal notices of copyright infringement from Tommy Wiseau, the director, writer, producer, and star of The Room. Another attempt to release the film in 2017 to capitalize on the film The Disaster Artist was stymied by Wiseau, who filed an injunction in Ontario courts, preventing a DVD release of the film and setting up a lengthy legal battle. After a final trial in January 2020, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice judge Paul Schabas ruled in favour of the makers of Room Full of Spoons, therefore allowing the film to be marketed and released. He ordered Wiseau to pay roughly $700,000 to them in court costs and lost revenue. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Documentary films about films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian documentary films ",
