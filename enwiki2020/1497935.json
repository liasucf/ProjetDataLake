    "text": "Communist Association of Norrk\u00f6ping (in Swedish: Norrk\u00f6pings Kommunistiska F\u00f6rening), was a communist group in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden. In 1978 a pro-Albanian group based in Norrk\u00f6ping had broken away from the Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (Communist Party of Sweden). This group formed NKF. In 1979 NKF merged with Stockholms Kommunistiska Enhetsgrupp to form Sveriges Kommunistiska F\u00f6rbund - ml (Communist League of Sweden - ml), which later became Kommunistiska Partiet i Sverige (Communist Party in Sweden). A series of expulsions from KPS 1983-1984 led to the refoundation of NKF. In 1987 NKF started publishing R\u00f6d Gryning (Red Dawn). Gradually NKF diverted from the pro-Albanian line and embraced Trotskyism. In 1989 NKF changed its name to Marxist-Leninistiska F\u00f6rbundet (Marxist-Leninist League). In 1990 MLF dissolved itself and its cadres joined Arbetarlistan (Workers List). In 1992 a section of former MLF-members founded F\u00f6rbundet f\u00f6r ett Revolution\u00e4rt Parti (League for a Revolutionary Party).
