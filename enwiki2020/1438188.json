Then ordered back to California, she remained on the West Coast into June 1919. On 17 June she got underway from San Francisco, California, and on 25 June, arrived at Pearl Harbor. Given hull classification symbol SS-93 in July 1920 she operated with fleet units for the next 11 years. R-16 departed Pearl Harbor on 12 December 1930 and, after transiting the Panama Canal, proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she decommissioned on 12 May 1931. ===1940-1946=== In reserve for the next nine years, she recommissioned on 1 July 1940 and, by the end of the year, had again assumed patrol duties in waters off Panama. Ordered back to the East Coast in the fall of 1941, she arrived at Key West, Florida, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. By 18 December, she was at New London, Connecticut, whence she conducted patrols and assisted in antisubmarine warfare training into February 1942.
