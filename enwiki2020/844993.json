The 12th convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR (elected in 1990) issued the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, introduced elements of a market economy and political liberalization, and officially changed the numeration of its sessions, proclaiming itself the first convocation of the \"Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine\". The current parliament is the ninth convocation. Because of the War in Donbass and the unilateral annexation of Crimea by Russia, elections for the constituencies situated in Donbass and Crimea were not held in the 2014 and 2019 elections; hence the current composition of the Verkhovna Rada consists of 424 deputies. In the last elections to the Verkhovna Rada, a mixed voting system is used. 50% of seats are distributed under party lists with a 5% election threshold and 50% through first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies.Parliament passes law on parliamentary elections, Kyiv Post (17 November 2011) The method of 50/50 mixed elections was used in the 2002, 2012, 2014 and 2019 elections; however, in 2006 and 2007, the elections were held under a proportional system only.Ukrainian communists to seek return to proportional electoral system, Interfax-Ukraine (8 November 2012) According to the election law that became valid on 1 January 2020 the next election to the Verkhovna Rada (set for 2023) again will be held under a proportional scheme. ==Name== The name Rada () means \"council\", \"rede\". The institution originated in the time of Kyivan Rus, and then represented a council of boyars and of higher clergy. In the 17th and 18th centuries the Dnieper Cossacks used the term to refer to the meetings where major decisions were made; the Cossacks elected new councils by popular vote. The Ukrainian People's Republic between 17 March 1917 and 29 April 1918 had a Central Rada. The West Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian government-in-exile each had a UNRada (Ukrainian National Rada). Verkhovna, the feminine form of the adjective meaning supreme, derives from the Ukrainian word meaning \"top\". Another name, used less often, is the Parliament of Ukraine (). ==History== ===Before independence=== * Central Rada in 1917\u201318 * Ukrainian National Rada in 1918 (West Ukraine) * Labour Congress of Ukraine in 1919 (along with West Ukrainian delegates) * Rada of Republic in 1921 (exiled in Tarnow, Poland) The Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR replaced the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets and was a type of legislative authority of Soviet Ukraine according to the 1937 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR. The All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets had already been renamed the Supreme Council in 1927.Serhy Yekelchyk '\"Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation, Oxford University Press (2007), , page 89 The Congress of Soviets was initiated by its Central Executive Committee, which it elected and held accountable. The last chairman of the committee was Hryhoriy Petrovsky (also known as Grigoriy Petrovskiy in Russian transliteration). The first elections to the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR took place on 26 June 1938. The first session of the parliament took place in Kyiv from 25 July through to 28 July 1938. The first Chairman of the council was Mykhailo Burmystenko who later died during World War II. In 1938, a Presidium was elected by the council that was chaired by Leonid Korniyets. The Presidium represented the council whenever it was not in session. During the war the Presidium was evacuated to the city of Saratov in the Russian SFSR. On 29 June 1943, the Presidium issued an order postponing elections for the new convocation for one year while extending the first convocation. On 8 January 1944, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR in agreement with the Communist Party decided to relocate the Presidium of the Supreme Council from Kharkiv to Kyiv. New elections were scheduled for 9 February 1947 for the Council. Yulia Tymoshenko, is appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine in the Rada on 4 February 2005. ===Post-Soviet period=== Until 24 August 1991, Verkhovna Rada kept the name Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR. The first partially free elections to the Verkhovna Rada and local councils of people's deputies were held on 4 March 1990. Although the Communist Party still remained in control, a \"Democratic Bloc\" was formed by numerous parties, including People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh), Helsinki Watch Committee of Ukraine, Party of Greens of Ukraine, and many others. The twelfth convocation of the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR issued the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine on 16 July 1990, and declared Ukrainian independence on 24 August 1991, at approximately 6 p.m. local time. At the time, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada was Leonid Kravchuk. The Act of Ukrainian Independence was overwhelmingly supported in a national referendum held on 1 December 1991. On 12 September 1991, the parliament adopted the law \"On the Legal Succession of Ukraine\". Thus, the VR became the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The Constitution of Ukraine was adopted by the thirteenth convocation of the Verkhovna Rada on 28 June 1996, at approximately 9 a.m. local time. The parliament's fourteenth convocation officially changed the numbering of the convocations proclaiming itself the third (democratic and independent) convocation of the Verkhovna Rada. After the Orange Revolution, constitutional amendments were adopted in December 2004, by the fourth (fifteenth) convocation of the Verkhovna Rada. On 1 October 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 Amendments, considering them unconstitutional.Update: Return to 1996 Constitution strengthens president, raises legal questions, Kyiv Post (1 October 2010) On 21 February 2014, parliament reinstated the December 2004 amendments to the constitution.Ukrainian parliament reinstates 2004 Constitution, Interfax- Ukraine (21 February 2014) In 2017 and 2018, the website of the Verkovna Rada was the most popular among all websites of the parliaments of UN member states. ==Location== Full view of building Front entrance Side street perspective The Verkhovna Rada meets in a neo-classical building on Kyiv's vulytsia Mykhaila Hrushevskoho (Mykhaila Hrushevsky Street) and Ploshcha Konstytutsii (Constitution Square). The building adjoins Mariinsky Park and the 18th century Mariyinsky Palace, designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, which serves as the official residence of the President of Ukraine. After the transfer of the capital of the Ukrainian SSR from Kharkiv to Kyiv in 1934, a whole set of government buildings was planned for the city. In 1936, a contest for the construction of the new parliament building was won by architect Volodymyr Zabolotny. The original building was constructed from 1936\u201338. Having been destroyed in the Second World War, the building was reconstructed from 1945\u20131947, with the rebuilt glass dome one metre higher than the original. ===Other locations=== * Palace Ukraina (the 1999 presidential oath of Leonid Kuchma) * Ukrainian House (21 January 2000) * Building of budget committee (6-8 vulytsia Bankova on 4 April 2013) ==Mission and authority== The Verkhovna Rada is the sole body of legislative power in Ukraine.

The formation of official parliamentary factions is regulated by the Verkhovna Rada's rules and procedures. Only 15 or more deputies may form a parliamentary faction and an MP may be a member of only one faction at a time. The chairman and his two vice-Chairman may not be the heads of factions.Rada amends regulations of its activities, Kyiv Post (8 October 2010) Under current parliamentary rules a faction of non-partisan politicians can not be smaller than the smallest faction of a political party.

The group elects its own chairperson, his or her deputy and a secretary on principles for establishing the temporary special commission. The group terminates its activity with establishment of parliamentary committees. Before the opening of the first session of each newly elected parliament, all newly elected People's Deputies of Ukraine are gathered for a special ceremonial meeting to take the oath of office (article 14, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). An Invitation to take the oath is given by the Chairperson of the previous convocation who grants the leading word to the oldest member of the parliament who asks the members of parliament to rise and reads the oath out-loud.

Each convocation of the Verkhovna Rada has been elected under a different set of laws gradually evolving from the purely majoritarian scheme inherited from the Soviet era to a purely proportional scheme, effective from 2006 until 2010. The next election to the Verkhovna Rada (set for 2023) Early to rejoice? Regular parliamentary elections may take place under Yanukovych's law, Civil movement \"Chesno\" (11 July 2019) again will be held under a proportional scheme. In the 1990 and 1994 elections, all 450 MPs were elected in single-member districts. Ukraine was therefore divided at the time into 450 electoral districts. Each district sent one member to parliament. In order to win a seat, a candidate needed more than 50% of the votes. If no candidate had 50%, then the two leading candidates participated in a run-off vote. In the 1998 and 2002 elections, 225 MPs were elected in single-member districts as earlier (with the exception that the candidate needed only a simple majority to win). The remaining 225 MPs were elected on a proportional basis. These seats were divided between the parties who passed a 4% electoral threshold. In the 2006 and 2007 elections, all deputies were elected on a proportional basis. All seats were divided between the parties who passed a 3% electoral threshold. For the 2007 election, the threshold percentage was not changed, but some amendments to the election process were made.
