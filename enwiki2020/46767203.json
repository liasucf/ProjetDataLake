He was first exposed to hip hop through his father who would listen to 80s and 90s hip hop as well as reggae at home, all of which influenced Wrate to take an interest in music and start rapping more seriously around the age of 17. He released his debut mixtape entitled Nothing Long Volume 1 under Defenders Entertainment in 2004, but he took a break from music following a spell of both underground and commercial success through the mixtape which was played on mainstream radio stations such as Choice FM, BBC Radio 1Xtra and Kiss FM, as well as street DVDs in circulation at the time such as Streetz Incarcerated, Streetz Is Raw and Welcome to the City. Between 2005 and 2006 he recorded material for a second mixtape, which was initially entitled Nothing Long Volume 2, but it was never released due to the legal troubles Wrate was experiencing at the time, as well as a change in his own preferences as he has stated that he did not want to release many of the songs he had recorded. ===Hollow Meets Blade with Giggs (2007)=== Wrate released his second mixtape entitled Hollow Meetz Blade which was a collaboration with fellow South London rapper Giggs. The mixtape received general acclaim from both underground and mainstream rap fans in the United Kingdom. However, Wrate failed to capitalise on the hype from the mixtape and took a break from music shortly after its release. ==Discography== ===Mixtapes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| UK R&B; |- ! scope=\"row\" | Nothing Long Volume 1 | * Released: 2004 * Label: Defenders Entertainment * Formats: CD | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Hollowman Meets Blade (with Giggs) | * Released: 2007 * Host: Robeworld.com * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Best of Blade | * Released: 2009 * Label: Ruthless Records * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bags and Boxes | * Released: 31 March 2010 * Host: Mykal Million * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Financial Times | * Released: 31 March 2011 * Label: Hill Productions * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Best of Blade 2 | * Released: 9 February 2012 * Host: Charlie Sloth * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bags and Boxes 2 | * Released: 30 November 2012 * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Best of Blade 3 | * Released: 14 October 2014 * Host: Big Bad Blue * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bags and Boxes 3 | * Released: 31 November 2014 * Label: Self-released * Formats: CD, digital download | 42UK Official Album Charts: Bags and Boxes 3 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bags and Boxes 4 | * Released: 16 August 2019 * Label: Catalyst Records * Formats: Digital download, streaming | 12 || \u2014 |- | colspan=\"20\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes an album that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===Other charted songs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Joints\" | 2019 | 70 | Bags and Boxes 4 |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Event !Prize !Nominated work !Result !Ref |- |2010 |Official Mixtape Awards |Best Hip Hop Mixtape |Bags and Boxes | | |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2012 |rowspan=\"3\"|Official Mixtape Awards |Mixtape of the Year |Financial Times | | |- |Best Hip Hop Mixtape |Financial Times | | |- |Best Male Artist | | |The Official Mixtape Awards (OMA\u2019s) Nominations Are In |- |2013 |Official Mixtape Awards |Best Overall Mixtape |Bags and Boxes 2 | |OMS Awards Nominations 2013 |- |2015 |Rated Awards |Best Video |Drug Dealer (featuring Tiggs Da Author) | |RATED AWARDS ANNOUNCE CATEGORIES & NOMINEES |- |} ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Black British musicians Category:English hip hop musicians Category:English male rappers Category:Gangsta rappers Category:People from Battersea Category:People from Streatham Category:Rappers from London ",
