    "text": "Style is the sixth studio album by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro and her first in over three years. This album follows her crossover into contemporary R&B; and hip hop from the Suite Chic project. Although Amuro has always dabbled with R&B; beats, this is her first solo album to predominantly feature the actual style. First editions of the album included two bonus tracks, \"So Crazy (Mad Bear Mix)\" and \"Wishing on the Same Star (Movie Version).\" Style is also the first Amuro album not to be produced by Tetsuya Komuro since her Super Monkeys days, as well as her last collaboration with producer Dallas Austin to date. == Overview== The emphasis of the album is R&B;/Hip-Hop but the album still features some pop songs. Amuro explained that the inclusion of certain styles of songs were for variety. The album also contains several cover songs. The song \"Indy Lady\" is a cover of American R&B; artist, Toni Estes' \"Independent Lady.\" Other songs previously recorded by other artists include \"Come\" (originally by Sophie Monk), \"As Good As\" (also recorded by WhatFor) and \"Wishing on the Same Star\" (originally by Keedy). The song \"Put 'Em Up\" which was released as the second single preceding the album is slightly edited from its original form. Instead of fading out, the song comes to an abrupt end. \"Lovebite\" is a collaboration with Takuro of the Japanese rock band Glay. Takuro and Amuro had previously spoken about collaborating years ago and they finally had an opportunity with this album. \"Four Seasons\" was used as the theme song to the third InuYasha motion picture, Swords of an Honorable Ruler. The song \"Come\" has also been used as the 7th ending theme for InuYasha. Style is Amuro's lowest ranking and selling album. Before the release of the album, Amuro launched her largest tour at the time, Namie Amuro So Crazy Tour featuring Best Singles 2003-2004. Due to the nature of the tour, she only performed the singles from the new album. Ultimately, many of the songs from the album have never been performed to a public audience. She did tour the actual album for an exclusive fan club tour in 2004 that was not open to the public. The album represents a major shift in Amuro's musical direction, and would set the tone for all of the singer's subsequent releases. AllMusic described the album as \"marginally more gritty,\" taking Amuro \"closer in sound to her musical idol, Janet Jackson.\" ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Namie Amuro - vocals, background vocals * Arkitec - vocals * Verbal - vocals * Zeebra - vocals * Mr. Blistah - additional vocals * Clench - additional vocals * Coyass - additional vocals * Kareb James - background vocals * L.L.
