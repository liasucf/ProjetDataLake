    "text": "Antonia Mar\u00eda Teresa Mirabal Reyes de Guzm\u00e1n (October 15, 1935 \u2013 November 25, 1960) was a surveyor and political activist from the Dominican Republic. She was one of three sisters assassinated together at the direction of the country's dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo. == Early years == Mar\u00eda Teresa was the youngest of four sisters born into a wealthy family in the Dominican province of Salcedo (now, after a name change, it is called Hermanas Mirabal, or in English, Mirabel Sisters). Her parents were Enrique Mirabal Fern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Reyes Camilo.Peter Farrington (17 December 2013). \"Mirabal Sisters of The Dominican Republic\". The REAL Dominican Republic. Like her sisters before her, she attended Colegio Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega. She graduated from the Colegio Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas in Santiago de los Caballeros and in 1954, from the Liceo de San Francisco de Macor\u00eds in mathematics. She then continued her studies to become a surveyor at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. On February 14, 1958, she married fellow engineer Leandro Guzm\u00e1n and on February 17, 1959, their daughter Jacqueline was born. Maria Teresa admired her sister Minerva and like her became involved in political activities. In time, the siblings became known collectively as the Mirabal Sisters. Her outrage at the \"trujillista tyranny\" was so profound that she joined a January 1959 conspiracy that was hatched in the residence of Guido D'Alessandro (political nephew of her sister Minerva) to lay the foundations for what later would be called the June 14 Revolutionary Movement, hoping to overthrow dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo. == Detentions == The three murdered Mirabal sisters. On January 20, 1960, Mar\u00eda Teresa was detained at a military base in Salcedo, but released on the same day. Two days later, on January 22, she and sister Minerva were detained and taken to La Cuarenta, the infamous torture prison, and then transferred to another prison, La Victoria. They were released on February 7, 1960, but shortly thereafter, on March 18, Mar\u00eda Teresa and Minerva were arrested again and returned to La Cuarenta. They were given a five-year sentence but that was reduced to three years on appeal, and they were released again on August 18, 1960. Mar\u00eda Teresa was not intimidated by political confrontation saying, \u201cLife is risked without thinking about possible personal benefits, since the main reason for which we fight is the complete cancellation of privileges [...] perhaps what is closest to us is death, but that idea does not intimidate me: we will continue fighting for what is just.\" == Murders == On November 25, 1960, when three of the sisters, Minerva, Patria and Mar\u00eda Teresa, were returning from visiting the prison holding their husbands, who were leaders of the June 14 Revolutionary Movement, the women were ambushed by agents of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM) outside of Puerto Plata. Each was fiercely beaten to death, as was their driver Rufino de la Cruz. At that time, Patria was 36 years old, Minerva was 34, and Mar\u00eda Teresa was 24. Their bodies were found with the vehicle, destroyed at the bottom of a ravine. While the crime scene was meant to indicate that the sisters and driver died in the \"accidental fall,\" it became widely assumed that their deaths were the work of the dictator and became a source of national outrage and called \"the last straw for the Dominican people.\" == Aftermath == According to historian Bernard Diederich, the assassinations of the Mirabal sisters \"had greater effect on Dominicans than most of Trujillo's other crimes.\" The killings, he wrote, \"did something to their machismo\" and paved the way for Trujillo's own assassination six months later on May 30, 1961.Bernard Diederich (1999). Trujillo: The Death of the Dictator. Markus Wiener Publishing. p. 71. . In the Caribbean country today, the sisters are remembered as \"symbols of both popular and feminist resistance.\" == Tributes == Every year on November 25th, the three sisters, Minerva, Patria and Mar\u00eda Teresa, are honored on the International Day to Eliminate Violence against Women, which was declared by the UN in their honor. Commemorations of all three sisters (called martyrs by some) have so far included many poems, songs and books, including Julia Alvarez's second novel In the Time of the Butterflies (1994). == See also == * Mirabal sisters == References == Category: 1935 births Category: 1960 deaths Category:Assassinated activists Category:Assassinated Dominican Republic people Category:Dominican Republic activists Category:Dominican Republic women activists Category:Hermanas Mirabal Province Category:People murdered in the Dominican Republic Category:Deaths by beating ",
