Hooten circa 1840. This was followed by numerous others, leading to the construction of a three-story mill building in the early 1890s. By 1896, Riverdale had a general store and post office. In the early 1900s, the current dam was constructed and an iron truss bridge crossed the waterway. The mill burned in 1926 and was not rebuilt, ending the era of flour production.
