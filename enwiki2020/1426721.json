    "text": "The Polish Socialist Party (, PPS) is a left-wing Polish political party. It was one of the most important parties in Poland from its inception in 1892 until its dissolution in 1948. A party with the same name was established in 1987 but has remained at the margins of Polish politics. J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, founder of the Second Polish Republic, was a member and later leader of the PPS in the early 20th century. ==History== The PPS was founded in Paris in 1892 (see the Great Emigration). In 1893 the party called Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, (SDKPiL), emerged from the PPS, with the PPS being more nationalist and oriented towards Polish independence, and the SDKPiL being more revolutionary and communist. In November 1892 the leading personalities of the PPS agreed on a political program. The program, largely progressive for the time of its creation, accented: *Independent Republic of Poland based on democratic principles *Direct universal voting rights *Equal rights for all nations living in Poland *Equal rights for all citizens, regardless of race, nationality, religion and gender *Freedom of press, speech and assembly *Progressive taxation *Eight-hour workday *Minimum wage *Equal wages for men and women *Ban on child labour (till age 14) *Free education *Social support in case of injury in the workplace After the Revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire, the party membership drastically increased from several hundred active members to a mass movement of about 60,000 members. Another split in the party occurred in 1906, with the Revolutionary Faction following J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who supported the nationalist and independence ideals, and the Left faction which allied itself with the SDKPiL. However, the Revolutionary Faction became dominant and renamed itself back again to the PPS, while the Left was eclipsed, and in 1918 merged with SDKPiL forming the Communist Party of Poland. In 1917-18 the party participated in the Central Council of Ukraine and the Government of Ukraine. During the Second Polish Republic the PPS at first supported J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, including his May Coup, but later moved into the opposition to his authoritarian Sanacja regime by joining the democratic 'centrolew' (center-left) opposition movement. Many PPS leaders and members were put on trial by Pi\u0142sudski's regime and jailed in the infamous Bereza Kartuska prison. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 316 The party supported the Polish resistance during World War II as the underground Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Freedom, Equality, Independence (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna \u2013 Wolno\u015b\u0107, R\u00f3wno\u015b\u0107, Niepodleg\u0142o\u015b\u0107). In 1948 it suffered a fatal split, as the communists applied the salami tactics to dismember any opposition. One faction, which included Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski wanted to join forces with the Polish Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz, argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one- party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk, leader of the Peasant Party, would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister. In 1948, Cyrankiewicz's faction of Socialists merged with the Communist Polish Workers' Party (PPR) to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), the ruling party in the People's Republic of Poland; remnants of the other faction survived on emigration in the Polish government- in-exile and because of that Polish Socialist Party was still active on emigration. Cyrankiewicz's faction isn't really treated as proper PPS. A new party of the same name, which seeks to carry on the tradition of the original PPS, was established by left-wing opposition figures such as Jan J\u00f3zef Lipski in 1987. However, the new PPS remains a marginal group within the political landscape of the Third Republic, having representation in the Sejm only between 1993 and 2001. However, in the 2019 Polish parliamentary election the PPS saw its leader Wojciech Konieczny elected to the Senate of Poland under the banner of The Left.Wnp.pl Its main propaganda outlet was the Robotnik ('The Worker') newspaper. The current party published the Nowy Robotnik (\"The New Worker\"), a continuation of the original publication, from 2003 to 2006. == Election results == === Sejm === {| class=wikitable |- !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats !Seat change |- !1919 |515,062 |9.2 | |n/a |- !1922 |906,537 |10.3 | | 6 |- !1928 |1,482,097 |13.0 | | 23 |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1930 |1,965,864 |17.3 | | 41 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Centrolew coalition, which won 79 seats in total. |- !1935 |colspan=4| Boycotted |- !1938 |colspan=4| Boycotted |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |1947 |9,003,682 |26.13 (#1) | | 116 |- | colspan=\"4\" |As part of the Democratic Bloc coalition, which won 394 seats in total. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1991 |230,975 |2.1 | |n/a |- | colspan=4|As part of the Labour Solidarity coalition, which won 4 seats in total. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1993 |2,815,169 |20.4 | | 4 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 171 seats in total. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1997 |3,551,224 |27.1 | | 1 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 164 seats in total. |- !2001 |13,459 |0.1 | | 3 |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 2005 |91,266 |0.8 | | 0 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Polish Labour Party committee, which won no seats. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 2007 |160,476 |1.0 | | 0 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Polish Labour Party committee, which won no seats. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 2015 |1,147,102 |7.6 | | 0 |- | colspan=4|As part of the United Left coalition, which won no seats. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 |2,319,946 |12.6 | | 0 |- | colspan=4|As part of The Left coalition, which won 49 seats in total. |} === Senate === {| class=wikitable |- !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats !Seat change |- !1922 |468,147 |8.4 | |n/a |- !1928 |715,556 |11.2 | | 3 |- ! 1930 | colspan=4|As part of Centrolew coalition, which won 13 seats in total. |- !1935 |colspan=4| Boycotted |- !1938 |colspan=4| Boycotted |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1993 |4,993,061 |35.7 | | 1 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 37 seats in total. |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| 1997 |6,091,721 |45.7 | | 2 |- | colspan=4|As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 28 seats in total. |- !2001 |131,987 |0.5 | | 3 |- !rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 |415,745 |2.3 | | 1 |- | colspan=4|As part of The Left coalition, which won 2 seats in total. |} ===Presidential=== {| class=wikitable |- !colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"|Second Polish Republic |- ! rowspan=2|Election year ! rowspan=2|Candidate ! colspan=2|1st round ! colspan=2|2nd round |- ! votes ! % ! votes ! % |- !1922 |Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski |49 |9.1 (#5) |1 |0.2 (#5) |- !1926 |Supported J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski |292 |60.2 (#1) | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| |- !1926 |Zygmunt Marek |56 |11.6 (#3) |1 |0.2 (#3) |} {| class=wikitable |- !colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"|Third Polish Republic |- ! rowspan=2|Election year ! rowspan=2|Candidate ! colspan=2|1st round ! colspan=2|2nd round |- ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote |- ! 1995 | Supported Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski | 631,432 | 3.5 (#6) | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| |- ! 2000 | Piotr Ikonowicz | 38,672 | 0.2 (#10) | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| |- ! 2005 | Supported Daniel Podrzycki | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| |- ! 2020 | Supported Robert Biedro\u0144 | 432,129 | 2.2 (#6) | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| |- |} ===European Parliament=== {| class=wikitable !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|2004 | 48,667 | 0.80 | |- | colspan=4|As part of KPEiR-PLD coalition, which won no seats. |- !2009 |1,331 |0.02 | |} ==Notable people who were members or were associated with PPS== ===Presidents and heads of state=== *J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski (former member at time in office) *Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski (former member) *Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki (former member) *Stanis\u0142aw Ostrowski *Franciszek Tr\u0105balski ===Prime Ministers=== *Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski *J\u0119drzej Moraczewski *Janusz J\u0119drzejewicz (former member) *Walery S\u0142awek (former member) *Tomasz Arciszewski *Tadeusz Tomaszewski *Antoni Paj\u0105k *Alfred Urba\u0144ski *Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski (later became a communist) *J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz (later became a communist) ===Other figures=== *Jan J\u00f3zef Lipski *Boles\u0142aw Limanowski *Adam Cio\u0142kosz * *Jerzy Czeszejko-Sochacki (later became a communist) *Norbert Barlicki *Piotr Ikonowicz *Wojciech Konieczny *Jan Kwapi\u0144ski *Herman Lieberman *Stanis\u0142aw Mendelson *Stanis\u0142aw Dubois * *Mieczys\u0142aw Niedzia\u0142kowski * * *Zofia Praussowa *Kazimierz Pu\u017cak *Kazimierz Sosnkowski * *Leon Wasilewski *Aleksandra Zag\u00f3rska ==See also== *List of Polish Socialist Party politicians *Central Rada == Notes == ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Political parties in Poland ",
