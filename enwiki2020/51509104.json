It was founded in 2011 by Gavin Newton-Tanzer and David Weeks. Sunrise's education activities consist of running competitions and conferences for students in East Asia, with a particular focus on debate, business simulation, coding competitions, and other summer programs. Its debate events are run in partnership with the National High School Debate League of China, and Sunrise debate students often travel internationally to compete at debate competitions hosted at Stanford, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Asia Society. Sunrise's debate league is the oldest and largest high school English-language debate league in China, with competitions often hosted in second and third tier cities in China. Its case analysis league is the China Youth Business League, run in partnership with the Harvard Undergraduate Economics Association and the Wharton China Business Society. Sunrise sponsors the international case analysis competition at the Wharton China Business Forum along with PricewaterhouseCoopershttps://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/wharton-china- business-forum. Sunrise's events often feature low student registration fees that are subsidized by sponsorship from organizations or foreign universities seeking to engage students from China. As a media service company, Sunrise International advocates for universities and international brands to directly advertise on local Chinese media channels, citing issues surrounding the Great Firewall of China as a reason for why local users cannot access international social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Youtube. The organization is occasionally quoted by international education news outlets on various government relations and education policy issues. == References == Category:Social enterprises Category:Business models Category:Types of business entity ",
