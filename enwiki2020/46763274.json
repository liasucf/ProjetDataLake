Soldiers without politics, Blacks in the South African Armed Forces, Perspectives on Southern Africa, 33, University of California Press, Berkeley. AACR2 was established on 1 January 1994, at Mafikeng, Northwest Province as a result of the amalgamation of infantry elements of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force into the SANDF. ==SANDF's Motorised Infantry== SANDF's Motorised Infantry is transported mostly by Samil trucks, Mamba APC's or other un- protected motor vehicles. Samil 20,50 and 100 trucks transport soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. Samil trucks are all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain. Motorised infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy. == Leadership == ==Insignia== ===Previous Dress Insignia=== SANDF early era 10 SAI insignia ===Current Dress Insignia=== SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia ==Notes== == References == Category:Infantry battalions of South Africa Category:Infantry regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1994 Category:United Nations Force Intervention Brigade ",
