She is also a group analyst and a psychoanalytic psychotherapist. == Early life and education == Roseneil obtained a 1st class BSc(Econ) (special subject Sociology) from The London School of Economics, where she studied between 1985-1988 before undertaking a Ph.D. at the same institution. Roseneil's Ph.D. thesis is titled Feminist political action: the case of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp which she completed in 1994. Roseneil undertook postgraduate training in Group Analysis at the Turvey Institute for Group Analytic Psychotherapy, and received a postgraduate diploma in Group Analytic Psychotherapy from Oxford Brookes University and the Institute of Group Analysis. == Research == Roseneil's research spans sociology, gender studies, psychosocial studies and group analysis, and has focused on social movements, citizenship and gender politics, and on intimacy, sexuality and personal life. Her Ph.D. thesis studied the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp and how women can act collectively for social change, and against male domination and female subordination. The Greenham Common Peace Camp was an example of a non-violent feminist protest, started by Welsh anti-nuclear feminist group Women for Life on Earth, and mobilising hundreds of thousands of women over more than a decade. In 2016, at an event Bringing Greenham Home, which featured a weekend of Greenham-related films, Roseneil spoke about her personal ties to Greenham Common and her perception of the peace camps as \"queer, intersectional spaces, where both gender diversity and indigenous land rights were part of the discussion\". Roseneil has studied transformation in subjectivity, gender, sexuality, and personal life over time, focusing both on individual experience and the role of social movements and collective action in producing social change. Drawing on psychoanalysis, Roseneil is particularly interested in why there is individual or collective resistance, including unconscious resistance, to change. Among Roseneil's studies are explorations into the experiences of people in non-conventional couples and families, including people who are in relationships in which they live apart from their partners, people in lesbian and gay relationships, those in shared accommodation, and single people. A common thread is an interest in friendship and how support and care can be provided through non-familial networks. Her research also encompasses members of marginalised and racialised groups, first/second generation migrants and exiled communities. Roseneil uses a combination of biographical narrative, psychoanalytically informed methods, results from surveys and comparative national studies to gather single-person case studies alongside macro-level analysis. She has focused her research on people living in the United Kingdom and Bulgaria, Norway and Portugal. One example of her work, in a study called Living Apart Together, relates to couples who choose to live separately. This report suggested that the number of couples who live apart in the United Kingdom may be higher than the 6% found in the 2011 Census, a number that Roseneil claims is closer to 10% of the population. Nearly half are aged between 16 and 44. Reasons include the difficulty of finding jobs in the same location as more women now work, and women wanting respite from domestic chores traditionally expected in cohabiting. In earlier research on unconventional intimacies, Roseneil found that people were \"enmeshed in complex networks of intimacy and care, and had strong commitments and connections to others\" to whom they were not biologically or legally related. === Books === Roseneil has published the following books: *2015: Reproducing Citizens: family, state and civil society, (edited with Isabel Crowhurst, Ana Cristina Santos and Mariya Stoilova) *2013: Beyond Citizenship?
