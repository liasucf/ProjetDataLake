Mar\u00eda Isabel, is one of the few telenovelas that focuses on the life of an indigenous female protagonist and her community. The story was written by Yolanda Vargas Dulch\u00e9 and adapted by Ren\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz. On August 4, 1997, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting Mar\u00eda Isabel weekdays at 9:00pm, replacing La Jaula de Oro. The last episode was broadcast on January 23, 1998 with La Usurpadora replacing it the following day. Adela Noriega and Fernando Carrillo starred as protagonists, while Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola, Emo\u00e9 de la Parra and Jorge Vargas starred as antagonists. ==Plot== Mar\u00eda Isabel (Adela Noriega), is a beautiful, kind-hearted young woman of indigenous descent, faced with the responsibility of raising Rosa Isela, the orphaned daughter of her only true friend who has died. She finds employment at the home of Ricardo Mendiola, a wealthy widower, and his young daughter, Gloria. Ricardo\u2019s kindness and decency cause Maria Isabel to fall in love with him, though she keeps it a secret for many years. Gloria, however, influences Rosa Isela to feel ashamed of her \"Indian\" mother; the ungrateful child abandons Maria Isabel to live with her wealthy grandfather, without even a word of thanks. At last Ricardo, realizing that he is in love with her, asks Maria Isabel to be his wife. But their bliss is short-lived, and the couple will have many challenges ahead before they can find the happiness they have struggled all their lives to achieve. ==Cast== *Adela Noriega as Mar\u00eda Isabel Sanchez *Fernando Carrillo as Ricardo Mendiola Z\u00fa\u00f1iga *Lorena Herrera as Lucrecia Fontaner Hern\u00e1ndez *Patricia Reyes Sp\u00edndola as Manuela Rojas L\u00f3pez *Lilia Arag\u00f3n as Rosaura M\u00e9ndez Larrea *Jorge Vargas as Don F\u00e9lix Pereyra *Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ruiz as Pedro *M\u00f3nica Miguel as Chona *Alejandro Arag\u00f3n as Leobardo Rangel *Ra\u00fal Araiza as Andr\u00e9s *Emo\u00e9 de la Parra as Deborah Serrano *Juan Felipe Preciado as R\u00f3mulo Altamirano *Rodrigo Vidal as Gilberto *Roberto Ballesteros as Armando Noguera *Jorge Salinas as Rub\u00e9n *Polo Ort\u00edn as Ministerio Vilchis *Guillermo Aguilar as Dr. Rivas *Isabel Mart\u00ednez \"La Tarabilla\" as Chole *Javier Herranz as Jos\u00e9 Luis *Angelina Pel\u00e1ez as Micaela *Ilse as Graciela Pereyra *Charlie as Nicol\u00e1s *Susana Gonz\u00e1lez as Elisa de Mendiola *Valentino Lan\u00fas as Antonio Altamirano *Sabine Moussier as Mireya Serrano *Omar Alexander as Anselmo *\u00c1ngeles Balvanera as Panchita *Eduardo Benfato as Filiberto *Paty Bola\u00f1os as Abundia de Altamirano *Marcelo Buquet as Crist\u00f3bal *Julio Monterde as Dr. Carmona *F\u00e1tima Torre as Maria Isabel (child) *Naydelin Navarrete as Graciela Pereyra (child)/Rosa Isela (10 years old) *Ximena Sari\u00f1ana as Rosa Isela (13 years old) *Paola Otero as Gloria Mendiola *Violeta Isfel as Gloria Mendiola (10 years old) *Andrea Lagunes as Gloria Mediola (6 years old) *Natalia Ju\u00e1rez as Rosa Isela (baby) *Ana Luisa Peluffo as Iris *Enrique Rojo as Andr\u00e9s *Bertha Moss as Eugenia *Yadhira Carrillo as Josefina *Sergio Basa\u00f1ez as Gabriel *Abraham Ramos as Ram\u00f3n *Aurora Clavel as Amargura *Rafael Rojas as Rigoberto *Guillermo Rivas as Father Salvador *Patricia Mart\u00ednez as Matilde *Tania V\u00e1zquez as Sonia *Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada as Pedrito *Magda Guzm\u00e1n as Director *Andrea Torre as Gloria's friend *Ernesto Laguardia as Luis Torres == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; !
