    "text": "Edward Baker Talcott (January 21, 1858 \u2013 April 5, 1941) was a Major League Baseball executive. Talcott, a lawyer and stockbroker, financed the New York Giants franchise of the Players' League in 1890, along with Edwin McAlpin. When the League began to face financial difficulty following the 1890 season, Talcott, McAlpin, and Brooklyn Ward's Wonders owner Wendell Goodwin agreed to merge their clubs with the National League counterparts in their own club's cities. Talcott then became a minority owner in the National League's New York Giants. He would sell his shares to Andrew Freedman after the 1894 season.Nemec, p. 185 ==References== Bibliography * Category:Baseball executives Category:1858 births Category:1941 deaths ",
