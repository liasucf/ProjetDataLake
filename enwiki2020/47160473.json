The association is the luxury hotel industry\u2019s influencer that reaches hotel and travel professionals through its media channels and publications. It brings together industry experts and thought leaders to answer the greatest challenges facing the luxury hotel business today. ==History== The International Luxury Hotel Association started in 2008 as Luxury Hoteliers established by a small group of 50 global luxury hotel executives and headed up by its current President Barak Hirschowitz. At that time, their purpose was to share best practices despite often being in competition with one another. It was all about transparency and keeping pace with the changing needs of luxury hotel guests. Few years after, due to the growth of the membership, it was re-established in Florida as a non-profit organization with the name International Luxury Hotel Association. In September 2014, the ILHA held its annual Forward 2020 luxury hotel conference at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Washington D.C. where issues relating to lodging, authenticity, and luxury travel trends were discussed. ==Partnerships and services== The International Luxury Hotel Association brings together luxury hotel experts, travel companies, industry professionals, governments and educators with the common goal of improving standards in service and design in the luxury segment of the hotel industry. The ILHA achieves these goals by organizing annual Luxury Hotel Conference, publishing its bimonthly premier magazine tagged Luxury Hotelier, and providing other resources for education, training, and networking to its members. The ILHA has established a partnership with TrustYou; an online reputation management company, to produce the North America Guest Experience Awards. In 2015 it also established a partnership with PR Newswire to help the outfit distribute its content to the hospitality industry and also enhance the luxury hotel enterprise. ==See also== * The Leading Hotels of the World * International Hotel & Restaurant Association ==References== ==External links== * Category:Organizations based in Palm Beach County, Florida Category:Hospitality industry organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Florida Category:Organizations established in 2008 ",
