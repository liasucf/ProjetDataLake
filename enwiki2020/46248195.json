    "text": "Hardwell On Air (abbreviated HOA) is the name of a weekly radio show created and hosted by Dutch DJ and record producer Hardwell. Since 4 March 2011, the program has been broadcast live on Fridays from 11:00 p.m. to 00:00 via Hardwell's official YouTube and Facebook profile. A number of Internet and FM radio stations broadcast the podcast in their program as well. During the show, he presents new productions in a one-hour set. According to his own statement the tracks embody the genres electro-, progressive- and tech-house. Since quite some time, the episodes are finished with a hardstyle track and even during the set there are several deviations from the genres. All episodes are offered as free download on iTunes in the category \"Podcasts\". == Concept == The sets have a length of one hour and are initiated with a vocal short. This consists of a distorted voice, which introduces each episode with the same word sequence: \"Are we on Air? Welcome to the soundtrack of your nightlife. One hour of the present and future. Tune in, to Hardwell on air\". The soundtrack of the intro consists of the song \"Encoded\" by Hardwell himself, released in the year 2011.\"Hardwell On Air intro\". YouTube A follow- up statement from Hardwell can be heard. Usually follows this one or more smoother songs. The following categories are processed in each episode: * Hardwell Exclusive: One or more songs that will be released on \"Revealed Recordings\" and / or were produced by Hardwell himself. * Track of the Week: A newly released song, which convinces by high quality and / or other factors. * Demo of the Week: A demotrack that was sent to Hardwell or the label. Demo of the Week was then replaced with three Community Picks which are tracks sent to the label and then released under the sub-label Revealed Radar. After the different categories have been dealt with, the music style is mostly changed to hardstyle or future-bass, whereupon the episode experiences a back- announcement by Hardwell. For many songs, a shout or tag is added, which refers to the podcast, to protect the song from being used before the release is done. Regarding to this, in early 2017 a video came to the Internet, which shows Korean comedian and DJ G-Park and DJ Charles playing Jewelz & Sparks's \"Grande Opera\". During the break Hardwell can be heard presenting the track as well as the \"Hardwell On Air tag\" just before the drop starts. This indicated that the duo recorded the track from the podcast and did not get it legally.Matthew Meadow: \"A Pair of Asian DJs Dropped Hardwell's \u201cHardwell On Air\u201d in Their Set\". Your EDM As a running gag, the duo played the track in combination with the \"Hardwell On Air tag\" since then. On June 14, 2017 Jewelz & Sparks playing their track \"Grande Opera\" with Hardwell On Air sample again in Ultra Music Festival Korea, also posted in Facebook. == Channels == Hardwell during the special 300th episode. * Radio FG Belgique, Antwerp, Belgium * R\u00e1dio Energia 97 FM, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil * Alpha Radio, Warna, Bulgaria * ICRT, Taipei, Taiwan * Kick FM, Gelsenkirchen, Germany * sunshine live, Mannheim, Germany * DJ FM, Toronto, Canada * Dix FM, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia * Slam!FM, Hilversum, Netherlands * Radio 538, Hilversum, Netherlands * Dolfijn FM, Willemstad, Netherlands * UP FM, Manukau City, New Zealand * Mega Hits,P\u00e1gina Oficial/ Lisbon, Portugal * \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434, St. Petersburg, Russia * Radio Ambrosio, Lineares, Chile * Radio One Mallorca, Palma de Mallorca, Spain * Kiss 91.75 FM, Pattaya, Thailand * Electric Area, Washington, D.C., US * Mix FM, Beirut, Lebanon * Indigo 91.9 FM, Bangalore, India * Alfa Radio 104.1, Guayaquil, Ecuador * Hitz FM, Malaysia * Met 107 FM, Bangkok, Thailand * Reef FM, Tenerife * Sirius XM, USA/Canada/Puerto Rico * 1Mix online radio, Isle of Man * 106.1 Geronimo, Indonesia * CRI Hit FM, China (Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) * Radio La Marka 90.9 FM, Nicaragua * Freakhouse on Air, South Korea * Fame 95 FM (In The House Radio), Jamaica * Radio1 FM88, Rhodes, Greece == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable |- !
