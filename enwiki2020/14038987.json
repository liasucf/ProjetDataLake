    "text": "Clowns is a black and white arcade game released by Bally Midway in 1978. It is similar to Exidy's Circus from the prior year, in which the player controls a seesaw to propel two clowns into the air, catching balloons situated in three rows at the top of the screen. It was released on cartridge for Commodore VIC-20 in 1982 and for the Commodore 64 in 1983. == Gameplay == Players start with two clowns and they get to control where they go with a seesaw. The goal is to prevent them from falling to the ground, or else the level is lost. Players get three lives and can earn more after getting a certain number of points. Getting to the center ring at the top of the sky, while gaining points from popping balloons, will help players complete levels. As the player advances to the next level, hazards and objects will start appearing in the air trying to hurt the clowns. ==References== Category:1978 video games Category:Action video games Category:Arcade games Category:Commodore VIC-20 games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Video game clones Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about clowns ",
