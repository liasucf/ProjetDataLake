    "text": "The Lauterbrunnen\u2013M\u00fcrren Mountain Railway (, BLM, also known as M\u00fcrrenbahn) is a hybrid transport system in the Bernese Oberland area of Switzerland, which connects the villages of Lauterbrunnen and M\u00fcrren. The system consists of a connected aerial cableway, also known as the Gr\u00fctschalpbahn, and an adhesion worked mountain railway. The cableway replaced a funicular, on the same route, in 2010. The line provides a vital passenger and goods link to the resort village of M\u00fcrren, which is situated above the cliffs of the Lauterbrunnen Valley and has poor road access. It also commands a view of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau mountains across the depths of that valley. The line is owned by the Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen-M\u00fcrren AG, a subsidiary of the Jungfraubahn Holding AG, a holding company that also owns the Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn. Through that holding company it is part of the Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn. ==History== The former funicular above Lauterbrunnen The key milestones in the history of the line are: *1887 Concession obtained for the construction of the railways. *1889 The company is formed and construction starts. *1891 Railway opens. The planned opening on 1 June is delayed until 14 August due to a derailment. *1902 The funicular railway is converted from water gravity power to electric power . *1910 First winter operations started. *1912 Replacement of the locomotives on the M\u00fcrren to Gr\u00fctschalp section by motor coaches (type BDe 2/4). *1949 New vehicles and rope are installed on the Lauterbrunnen to Gr\u00fctschalp section. *1965 The new station at M\u00fcrren is opened. *1994 The freight loading operations at Gr\u00fctschalp are rebuilt. *2006 Last operation of the funicular from Lauterbrunnen to Gr\u00fctschalp was on 23 April and the first operation of the replacement cable car was on 16 December. ==Operation== ===Route=== Route of the BLM above the Lauterbrunnen valley, with the cablecar section in red and the rail section in green The BLM commences from Lauterbrunnen, using a terminus that is directly opposite the platforms of the Berner Oberland-Bahn (BOB) to Interlaken, and the Wengernalpbahn (WAB) to Kleine Scheidegg and Grindelwald. The first section of the line is an aerial cableway that rises in a distance of . The cableway follows the line of the funicular that preceded it, and the remains of the funicular are visible at many points. The aerial cableway and railway connect at Gr\u00fctschalp station, where both lines are within a single building, which also contains the line's workshop. A complex transfer machine in the station is used to transfer goods between the two sections and is well used since road access to M\u00fcrren is virtually impossible. The same machine was used to transfer goods between the funicular and rail, and has been retained for use with the cable car. From Gr\u00fctschalp to M\u00fcrren the line is continued as a long narrow gauge electric railway, which rises . Through most of its length, the rail line commands a view of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau across the depths of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. The railway has a single intermediate calling point, at Winteregg station, and runs to a terminus at M\u00fcrren station, where the platforms used by passengers are enclosed within a modern station building. Just before the station is reached, the line passes a large freight depot, used in the carriage of freight to M\u00fcrren. ===Cable car=== The cablecar that replaced the funicular The cable car section of the line is operated by a single cable car, which shuttles between Lauterbrunnen and Gr\u00fctschalp with a journey time of 4 minutes. The car has an upper passenger level, carrying up to 100 passengers, and a lower level capable of carrying 6 tonnes of freight. The cable car is scheduled with the railway to provide a through journey frequency of between two and four services per hour. ===Rail infrastructure=== Two trains pass in Winteregg station The rail line is single-track, with a passing loop at Winteregg station. It has a track gauge of and is electrified at 550 V DC supplied by overhead line. The line is operated using rail adhesion only, and has a maximum gradient of 5%. The former funicular shared the same track gauge, enabling the use of the funicular to transfer rolling stock to and from the electric railway. The rail section is operated by single electric railcars, often towing or pushing a flat car for goods, with a journey time of 14 minutes. The railway is scheduled with the cable car to provide a through journey frequency of between two and four services per hour. ===Rail vehicles=== The rail line uses the following self-propelled vehicles: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Image !Numbers !Notation !Year !Notes |- |180px |11 |BDe 2/4 |1913 |Built for the BLM by SIG/MFO.

In September 2019 it was announced that Jungfraubahn Holding AG had awarded Stadler Rail at Bussnang a contract to supply three trainsets for at a cost of 17.3m Swiss francs. In addition, M\u00fcrren railway station, other stations and the Gr\u00fctschalp workshop will be modernised. == See also == * List of funicular railways * List of funiculars in Switzerland == References == ==External links== * *Page on the BLM from the Jungfraubahn web site *Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen-M\u00fcrren in English.
