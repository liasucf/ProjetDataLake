Her writing has been described as a blend of \"personal writing with social analysis.\" Her book Future Sex explores how women see the dating world in the 21st century; Publishers Weekly described her book as \"an illuminating, hilarious account of sex and dating in the digital age, when hook-up culture and technology have vastly altered the romantic landscape.\"August 2016, Publishers' Weekly, Future Sex (book review), Retrieved August 30, 2016, ... Emily Witt. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, ... (224p) ... Witt is a graduate of Brown University and the University of Cambridge. She also graduated from Columbia's graduate school of investigative journalism. While in Mozambique on a Fulbright scholarship, she reported on Mozambican cinema for U.N. news agencies including IRIN and PlusNews. She wrote for numerous publications and moved to New York City. At age thirty, she found herself \"single and heartbroken\" and she resolved to explore why that was the case. Her focus shifted to dating and technology and sexuality; she traveled to San Francisco, dated often, and wrote about her encounters. She profiled the dating app Tinder. Witt noted that many coming-of-age novels rarely addressed the issue of sexuality from a feminine perspective. In Slate magazine in 2013, she noted that, in many classic novels, the subject of female sexuality was missing or subdued, in addition to having female characters being defined simply in opposition to dynamic male characters; when she turned to books written by men, she was turned off. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * * ===Essays and reporting=== * Online version is titled \"Is 2019 the year of the consenticorn?\". ===Book reviews=== * Emily Witt, \"A Blizzard of Prescriptions\" (review of Beth Macy, Dopesick, Head of Zeus, 2019; Chris McGreal, American Overdose: The Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts, Faber, 2018; Sam Quinones, Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic, Bloomsbury, 2016), London Review of Books, vol. 41, no. 7 (4 April 2019), pp. 23\u201326. \"OxyContin['s] lamentable [market] success was owed to a confluence of factors particular to the US. They include, but are not limited to: the country's dysfunctional privatised healthcare system, which makes it possible for addicts to accumulate doctors willing to prescribe painkillers in a way they can't in the UK; a corrupt regulatory agency [the Food and Drug Administration] beholden to the [pharmaceutical] industry it was tasked with regulating; a punitive legal paradigm that criminalises drug users instead of helping them; an abstinence-only approach to treating drug addiction that impedes evidence-based medication-assisted treatment; corporate greed; a political class that takes marching orders from the lobbyists of said corporations; entrenched poverty, joblessness and hopelessness; and a general epistemological failure when it comes to ideas about what 'drugs' are, which psychoactive chemicals are safe and which are dangerous, and what a drug dealer is supposed to look like. [This] prepared a consumer market for heroin. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, each one of them a world.\" (Emily Witt, p. 23.) ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st- century American women writers Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:American investigative journalists Category:American relationships and sexuality writers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Brown University alumni Category:Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni Category:Educators from New York City Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:The New Yorker people Category:People from Minnesota Category:Writers from Brooklyn ",
