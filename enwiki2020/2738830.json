The station opened on 15 October 1984 by British Rail as an experimental station is west of Manchester Oxford Road station on the Manchester-Liverpool Line. The station and all services calling there are operated by Northern Trains. ==Facilities== The station has no station building, no ticket machines and is unstaffed. There are CCTV cameras operating here. Each platform has waiting shelters, with seating available on only one side (towards Liverpool). A payphone was available on the Manchester-bound platform but lack of use and repeated vandalism saw it removed completely in early 2020. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps from the road below. Train running information can be obtained from timetable posters and by phone. ==Services== Services call every two hours hour in each direction, towards Urmston and Liverpool Lime Street to the west and towards Trafford Park and Manchester Oxford Road in the east in off-peaks. Services increase to half-hourly during peak times and may stop at extra stations along the route. In the late evening services are hourly. There is no Sunday service provided. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Trafford Category:Railway stations opened by British Rail Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1984 Category:Northern franchise railway stations ",
