    "text": "Tin Shui Wai New Force () is a localist political group in Hong Kong established in late 2014 by a group of young people who had participated in the Umbrella Revolution. It claims to cater to the livelihood issues in Tin Shui Wai district. In the 2015 District Council elections, Wong Pak-yu, representing the group, ran in Tin Heng constituency against Beijing-loyalist Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) incumbent Luk Chung-hung but was defeated. In 2016, the group joined hands with other post-Umbrella organisations to run in the Legislative Council election. ==Performance in elections== ===Legislative Council elections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" |-align=center !
