    "text": "Neoendemism is one of two sub-categories of endemism, the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location. Specifically, neoendemic species are those that have recently arisen, through divergence and reproductive isolation or through hybridization and polyploidy in plants. Paleoendemism, the other sub-category, refers to species that were formerly widespread but are now restricted to a smaller area. ==Examples== Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago \"Darwin's finches\", residents of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, have been used since the 19th century as an example of how the descendants of one ancestor can evolve through adaptive radiation into several species as they adapt to different conditions on various islands. Charles Darwin wrote: > ...one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this > archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\" The Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago is also the home of paleoendemic species. ==See also== *Speciation ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Endemism ",
