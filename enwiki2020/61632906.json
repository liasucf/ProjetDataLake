    "text": "The February 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election was the fourth internal party election to elect the next leader of the Scottish Conservatives, part of the British Conservative Party and the second-largest political party in the devolved Scottish Parliament. Ruth Davidson, who won the previous leadership election in 2011, resigned on 29 August 2019. Two candidates contested the election; Jackson Carlaw MSP (Member of the Scottish Parliament), who served as the Scottish Conservatives' interim leader, and Michelle Ballantyne MSP. Carlaw was seen as the favourite in the contest, and won the endorsement of most of the party's MSPs and MPs (Members of Parliament). Carlaw won the election on 14 February 2020, winning more than three-quarters of the votes of party members. The leadership election was expected to take place in late 2019, but was delayed due to the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Carlaw represented the Conservatives in the two Scottish televised debates during the election campaign. == Background == On 28 August 2019, the Scottish Sun reported that Ruth Davidson was 'on the verge of resigning' due to disagreements with the leader of the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson, and the pressure with motherhood after giving birth to her first child in October 2018. On the next day, Ruth Davidson confirmed her resignation and said she would remain as an MSP until 2021. At the same time, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, who previously stood in for Davidson during her maternity leave, was announced as the interim leader of the party ahead of the leadership election. On 1 September, Adam Tomkins proposed that if he was ever to stand and be elected as leader, he might propose a new party to replace the Scottish Conservatives to create a pro-union alliance party made up of Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrats MSPs. However, he said that if Murdo Fraser stood, he wouldn't. The Herald reported that a permanent leader might not be in office until 2020, citing divisions on Brexit and the possibility of an early UK general election. The UK Parliament subsequently legislated for a general election to be held on 12 December 2019, which delayed the Scottish Conservative leadership election until early 2020. Carlaw served as interim leader during the election campaign, and represented the party during both of the Scottish television debates. In the 2019 general election the Conservatives won six seats in Scotland, losing seven of the 13 they had won in 2017. This loss in Scotland contrasted with a strong performance in England and Wales, which meant that the party won an overall majority of 80.. There was a growing feeling that following what had been a surprisingly good result for the Conservative Party, Jackson Carlaw would be elected leader with no opposition. Many senior Conservatives felt that with Holyrood elections coming up it would be better to avoid a contest and focus on uniting against the SNP. == Candidates == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Candidate !Born !Political office !Campaign ! class=unsortable | Ref. |- |100px '''''' | (age ) |Social security spokesperson MSP for South Scotland |100px Campaign | |- |100px '''''' | (age ) |Acting leader of the Scottish Conservatives MSP for Eastwood MSP for West Scotland |100px Campaign | |} === Declined === * Miles Briggs, health spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) * Liam Kerr, deputy leader and justice spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) * Murdo Fraser, finance spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Dean Lockhart, economy spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Liz Smith, education spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Adam Tomkins, constitutional spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Brian Whittle, MSP for South Scotland (endorsed Carlaw) *Annie Wells, equalities spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Donald Cameron, rural economy spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Maurice Golden, chief whip (endorsed Carlaw) *Jamie Greene, transport spokesperson (endorsed Carlaw) *Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland (to remain neutral) *Douglas Ross, Member of Parliament for Moray (endorsed Carlaw) == Campaign == Michelle Ballantyne announced her candidacy and was soon followed by Jackson Carlaw. Carlaw gained support from all his frontbenchers and many of his backbenchers plus former backbencher and former MP Ross Thomson. Jackson Carlaw launched his campaign on 15 January 2020, focusing on the forthcoming Scottish Parliament elections in 2021 and the next council elections in 2022, Jackson Carlaw built his campaign on wanting to spend the next eighteen months leading up to the elections at the Scottish Parliament to take down Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party in the process. Carlaw nominated Euan Waddell as his campaign manager, with MSPs Rachael Hamilton MSP and Liam Kerr MSP being co-chairs of his campaign. The first hustings of the campaign took place in Glasgow on 24 January 2020. === Hustings === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Date !

Carlaw had represented the Conservatives at the week's First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament shortly before announcing his resignation. == See also == *August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election *2019 Conservative Party leadership election *2019 United Kingdom general election == References == Category:2020 in Scotland Category:2020 elections in the United Kingdom 2020 Category:February 2020 events in the United Kingdom Category:2020s elections in Scotland ",
