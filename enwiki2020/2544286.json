Initially he was a wool classer/shearing contractor, shearing team overseer and later owner of his own shearing team. He is characterised by his well-built stature and his shy and reserved demeanour. Jon is a close friend and mentor of fellow Western Australian solo-sailor David Dicks. == Accomplishments == Jon Sanders was the first man to circumnavigate Antarctica solo, circling the continent twice in 1981 \u2013 1982. For this accomplishment, Gate 17 of the new Antarctica Cup Racetrack has been named after him, with sector 17 named after the S&S; 34 monohull Perie Banou, the yacht he had used during the circumnavigation.It is one of 18 gates and sectors within a circular race track bounded to the north by the Roaring Forties and the south by the Screaming Sixties latitudes. Sanders Gate is positioned mid-way round the Indian Ocean zone; the gate is close to where Sanders suffered a 180-degree knockdown. During the voyage, he passed south of the three great capes: Horn, Good Hope and Leeuwin, before rounding Cape Horn a second time. He turned north to Plymouth, UK and returning south around Good Hope and returning to Fremantle. This voyage was recognised in the Guinness Book of Records through the following records: *The first single-handed sailor to remain continuously at sea twice around the world *First single-handed sailor to round the five southernmost Capes twice on one voyage *First single-handed sailor to round the five southernmost Capes twice *Longest distance continuously sailed by any yacht: . *Longest period alone at sea during a continuous voyage: 419 days: 22 hours: 10 minutes In 1986 Sanders set out again from Fremantle, and this time completed three solo non-stop circumnavigations aboard his yacht Parry Endeavour, rounding Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago just north of the Equator each time to ensure that his course covered both hemispheres. Bob Williams, the Chairman of Antarctica Cup Management and the Antarctica Cup Ocean Race, says: \"What Jon achieved during his double circumnavigation in 1981/82 was truly remarkable, given the technology available at the time and size of his yacht. I have had the greatest respect for Jon ever since watching him set off in a full gale off Plymouth at the start of the Parmelia Race in 1979 and was very pleased to be a contributing sponsor for his next yacht Parry Endeavour in 1986/87. His achievement is an inspiration to all long distance ocean racing sailors and we are very happy to honour Jon now by naming this Gate 17 Sanders Gate and Sector 17 after his yacht Perie Banou\" On 2 November 2016, Sanders set out from Carnarvon, Western Australia on his tenth circumnavigation, which he completed on 20 December 2017. A live tracker of his progress is available here Parry Endeavour is now in the WA Maritime Museum, in Fremantle, Western Australia. == Other recognitions == Sanders was made an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for sailing in the 1983 New Year's Honours. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1989 Australia Day Honours for \"service to sailing and to marine science\".
