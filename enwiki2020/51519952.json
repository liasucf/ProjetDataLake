From a young age, Antosiewicz was an active member of the Slovenian Sokol athletics movement. He represented Yugoslavia at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands; he won a bronze medal with the men's all-around team, together with Stane Derganc, Dragutin Ciotti, Boris Gregorka, Anton Malej, Janez Porenta, Jo\u017ee Primo\u017ei\u010d, and Leon \u0160tukelj. In addition, he competed individually in all the men's disciplines. He finished 26th in individual all-around, 21st in horse vault, 38th in parallel bars, 36th in horizontal bar, 11th in rings, and 36th in pommel horse. In the years following, Antosiewicz participated at the 1930 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Luxembourg, where he won 3rd place with the Yugoslavia team and finished 15th in individual all-around. Antosiewicz's colleague Anton Malej suffered a fatal injury at that competition after falling at the end of his routine on rings. Yugoslavia did not participate at the 1932 Summer Olympics and also missed the 1934 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships because of political tensions with Hungary. Antosiewicz entered the national trials for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin but was outperformed by younger gymnasts and did not earn a place in the national team. Nevertheless, he went to Berlin as a sport referee and was a referee at the horse vault competition. Yugoslav team at the 1928 Summer Olympics.
