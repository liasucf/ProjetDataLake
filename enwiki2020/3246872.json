After her marriage to Pujie, she was known as, and identified herself as, Aishin Kakura Hiro (\u611b\u65b0\u89ba\u7f85\u2022\u6d69) or Aixin-Jueluo Hao in Chinese. == Life == Marquis Saneto Saga, Hiro Saga's father Pujie and Hiro Saga The Saga family was of the kuge court nobility and a branch of the Ogimachi Sanjo branch (\u6b63\u89aa\u753a\u4e09\u6761\u5bb6) of the northern Fujiwara lineage (\u85e4\u539f\u5317\u5bb6), she shared the same great- great-grand father with Emperor Meiji, Ogimichisanjo Sanetomo.

She was educated at the women's branch of the Gakushuin Peers' School. ===Princess=== In 1936, Saga was introduced to Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the ruler of Manchukuo. Pujie was then attending the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Saga and Pujie were wed in an arranged marriage. Pujie had selected her photograph from a number of possible candidates vetted by the Kwantung Army.Lebra, Above the Clouds pp.213 As his brother Puyi did not have a direct heir, the wedding had strong political implications, and was aimed at both fortifying relations between the two countries and introducing Japanese blood into the Manchu imperial family. The engagement ceremony took place at the Manchukuo embassy in Tokyo on 2 February 1937 with the official wedding held in the Imperial Army Hall at Kudanzaka, Tokyo on 3 April. In October, the couple moved to Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo. They had two daughters, Huisheng and Husheng, and what appeared to be a happy marriage. ===Later life=== During the Evacuation of Manchukuo during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Saga was separated from her husband. While Pujie accompanied Puyi in an attempt to escape by air, Saga and her younger daughter Husheng were sent by train towards Korea together with Wanrong (Puyi's wife). The train was captured by Chinese communist forces at the town of Dalizi, now in Linjiang, Jilin, in January 1946. In April, they were moved to a police station in Changchun, eventually released only to be rounded up again and locked up at a police station in Jilin in the north. When Kuomintang forces bombed Jilin, the prisoners were moved to a prison in Yanji.Behr, The Last Emperor, p. 268-9 Saga and her daughter were then taken to a prison in Shanghai and eventually repatriated to Japan. In 1961, after the release of Pujie from prison, the couple was reunited with permission from Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. They lived in Beijing from 1961 until her death in 1987.
