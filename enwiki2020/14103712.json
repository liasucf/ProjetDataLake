After premiering at South by Southwest, the film was purchased by Anchor Bay Entertainment for worldwide distribution. His second project was Under the Bed (2012), referred to by JoBlo.com as \"a blood-soaked horror extravaganza\"; the film premiered at Fantasia FestivalUNDER THE BED is an all-out assault on the senses and was acquired for release by XLrator Media. Miller's next film was the Christmas slasher film Silent Night (2012), a remake of Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984).Exclusive: Filming Begins on Silent Night; Director Steven C. Miller Speaks! Fearnet stated \"this straightforward and scrappy little remake is somehow more entertaining than half of what passes for 'wide release' horror movies these days.\" Silent Night, like The Aggression Scale, was released by Anchor Bay. Miller made a shift to mainstream filmmaking with four films produced by Emmett/Furla/Oasis and released by Lionsgate Premiere: Extraction (2015), Marauders (2016), Arsenal (2017) and First Kill (2017). Miller had his fifth collaboration with EFO and Lionsgate through the sequel Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018).
