    "text": "I Can Do That is an American entertainment television series broadcast on the U.S. television network NBC. It was launched on May 26, 2015, and was broadcast at 10 pm on Tuesday nights. The show is hosted by comedian and actor Marlon Wayans. Nicole Scherzinger was crowned the inaugural champion. After the renewal, the show has so far not had a second season, and did not return for the summer 2016 or 2017 seasons. NBC has removed it from the list of the current shows, indicating that it may have been ultimately cancelled after a single season. The American version of \"I Can Do That\" is based on the original format of the same name, launched by Israeli company Armoza Formats. The format has now been sold to over 20 other countries. The show's theme song is \"Can You Do This\" by Aloe Blacc. ==Overview== Six star entertainers rival each other competing and showcasing their talents with some chosen classic and unique acts that need skills they will learn to implement practicing with the original acts. After a week of training, they re-perform their acts live, with the public voting on the best re-enacted act of the week. The audience's vote for the best act of the week corresponds to the number of points the celebrity gains for that week with; First earning three points, second earning two points, and third earning one point. At the end of six weeks, the celebrity with the most points earns a Trophy and the title of \"The Greatest Entertainer\". On July 2, 2015, NBC renewed the series for a second season. ==Contestants== *Nicole Scherzinger, singer, lead singer of The Pussycat Dolls, dancer, and actress *Cheryl Burke, dancer, and choreographer on Dancing with the Stars *Ciara, singer, dancer, and actress *Jeff Dye, stand-up comedian from Last Comic Standing 6 *Joe Jonas, lead singer of the Jonas Brothers, actor, and lead singer of DNCE *Alan Ritchson, actor and singer ==Episodes== ==Scoreboard== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Place ! rowspan=\"2\" |Celebrity ! colspan=\"7\" |Weeks ! rowspan=\"2\" |Total Score |- !Week 1 !Week 2 !Week 3 !Week 4 !Week 5 !colspan=\"2\" |Week 6 |- ! 1 | | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |2nd |2nd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |W ! 17 |- ! 2 | Cheryl Burke |2nd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st |2nd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"pink\" |L ! 16 |- ! 2 | Joe Jonas | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"pink\" |2nd |2nd |bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st |2nd |bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |W ! 16 |- ! 4 | Alan Ritchson | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st |2nd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |2nd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd |2nd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd |bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |W ! 14 |- ! 5 | Jeff Dye |2nd |2nd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |2nd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | 2nd |bgcolor=\"pink\" |L ! 12 |- ! 6 | Ciara | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |1st | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd | bgcolor=\"pink\" |3rd |bgcolor=\"pink\" |L ! 8 |} == International versions == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px; background:#F8F8FF; width:100%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background- color:#cccfcf;\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:#cccfcf;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:#cccfcf;\" | Network ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:#cccfcf;\" | Host ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background- color:#cccfcf;\" | Year aired |- | scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:gold;\" | | scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:gold;\" | I can do that! | scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:gold;\" | Channel 2 (Keshet) | scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:gold;\" | Yaron Brovinsky | scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color:gold;\" | 2014 |- | | Ne nje jave | Top Channel | Arbana Osmani | 2015 |- | | \u0418 \u0430\u0437 \u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430 | Nova TV | Stanimir Gamov | 2015 |- |- | | Isso eu fa\u00e7o!
