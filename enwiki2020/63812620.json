She was survived by her sister, Eliza Urquhart (1885\u20131968). == Works == * Wayside, Angus & Robertson, 1919 * Maryplace: The Story of Three Women and Three Men, Nicholson & Watson, 1934 * Giving Amber Her Chance, Endeavour Press, 1934 == References == Category:1890 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Australian women journalists Category:20th-century Australian women writers ",
