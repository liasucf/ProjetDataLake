    "text": "Luise Rainer & Paul Baylay at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Berlin, 2011 Paul DH Baylay is an artist manager & music publisher notable for his work reuniting UK boyband Blue. In 2010, Baylay led a prominent campaign to have Jewish two time Academy Award winner, Luise Rainer, honoured in her native country of Germany. Rainer was the world's first actor to win back to back Oscars in 1936 & 1937\\. Rainer had been forgotten when the Boulevard der Stars opened in 2010 in Potsdamerplatz, Berlin, despite being Germany's only Academy Award-winning actor. In 2011, Rainer was nominated for a star but was then rejected by the jury (Senta Berger, Gero Gandert, Uwe Kammann, Dieter Kosslick and Hans Helmut Prinzler). Baylay campaigned across Germany, lobbying press and politicians to support the campaign to have the actress and her work recognised. The campaign was supported by the German Central Council of Jews. In August 2011, the Boulevard der Stars finally relented acknowledging the social media, email and letter campaign led by Baylay had been key in their decision to awarding an additional star in favour of Luise Rainer. In September 2011, Rainer then aged 101, flew to Berlin from her London home to formally receive her star on the Boulevard der Stars together with Paul Baylay and Klaus Wowerweit, the mayor of Berlin. Baylay has made several television appearances together with boyband Blue. In early 2013 he appeared on ITV2\u2019s The Big ReUnion together with the band and later that year appeared on Season 8 of Pro7\u2019s \u201cGermany's Next Top Model\u201d in Malibu, California where he set the challenge for the Blue\u2019s new music video \"Without You\". In 2014, Baylay returned to ITV2\u2019s The Big ReUnion in Season 2 (series_2) as manager of newly formed \u201c5th Story\u201d and in 2015 he made a cameo appearance as an actor appearing as himself in Episodes Three & Four of ITV2\u2019s \"Blue Go Mad in Ibiza\". All four members of Blue have been through personal bankruptcy guided by Baylay as detailed on ITV2's The Big Reunion in an effort to clean up a decade's worth of accumulative personal debts and bad investments. The group has sold in excess of 16 million albums worldwide over five studio albums and won two Brit Awards in 2002 & 2003\\. == References == == External links == * http://www.baylay.com * http://www.25media.net * https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/lee-ryan-charged-with-criminal-damage- after-arrest-for-drink-driving-in-west-london-9256266.html Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Talent managers Category:Music publishers (people) ",
