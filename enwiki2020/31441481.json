It is the church for the Hemne parish which is part of the Orkdal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The church seats about 450 people. ==History== The old Hemne Church of Saint Margrethae burned down on the night of the 14th and 15 December 1815, and it was quickly replaced with the present church building. Construction on the wooden, white, octagonal building began in March 1816 and was completed and consecrated on 29 June 1817. The church was built by a man called Jakob Kirkebygger (\"Jacob the church builder\"). The present church sits on the same site as the old church, with a graveyard surrounding the church. ==See also== *List of churches in Nidaros ==References== Category:Churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Heim, Norway Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:Octagonal churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1817 ",
