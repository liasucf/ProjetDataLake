The company began its operation in 1961 with the alliance of 10 young pilots. At the time, they transported cargo and charter passengers between Paran\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Mato Grosso. After six years in the company, Amaro left Taxi A\u00e9reo Mar\u00edlia. At the same time, it was sold to businessman Orlando Ometto, its headquarters moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, and the company profile changed when it became a courrier company. Upon leaving the company, Amaro, being at ease with personalized service, became an independent pilot. He bought his first airplane, a Cessna 170, and moved with his family to S\u00e3o F\u00e9lix do Araguaia, where he began his first business project and founded Araguaia Transportes A\u00e9reos (ATA). Two years later, the company had 15 airplanes. Captain Amaro\u2019s reconciliation with TAM took place in 1971, when Ometto asked him to become a minority partner owning 33% of the stocks. At the time, the company was going through a difficult financial period and was only transporting 3000 passengers. The following year, Amaro acquired half of the TAM stock and took over management of the company. He introduced his trademark and began practicing his primary philosophy: \u201cFocus on the client by offering quality service\u201d. In 1976, TAM - Transportes A\u00e9reos Regionais emerges as a scheduled regional airline, which learned from the experience of TAM - T\u00e1xi A\u00e9reo Mar\u00edlia. By then, Amaro owned 67% of the new company. The first year, while domestic aviation was growing 15% a year, TAM was registering an increase of 70% every six months. Amaro later took full control of the company\u2019s stock. Amaro died in a helicopter crash at Fortuna Guaz\u00fa, 38 kilometers from the Paraguayan city of Pedro Juan Caballero.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010717/ai_n14409359 At the time of his death, the company had grown to the point of being almost even with direct competitor Varig. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Brazilian aviators Category:Victims of helicopter accidents or incidents Category:2001 deaths Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Paraguay Category:Brazilian businesspeople Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:TAM Airlines Category:20th-century businesspeople ",
