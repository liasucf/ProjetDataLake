    "text": "Pietro Antonio Bernabei, M.D. (born 13 March 1948) is an Italian painter notable for his concept of bioarte. A native of Florence, Pietro Antonio Bernabei has, since 1990, focused his artistic research on life's biological image and its functional aspects, searching for cross-references which unite and disunite art and life sciences. To define his artistic work, he introduced, in 2000, the idea of bioarte 'BioArte' - 31 mar./9 giu. 2000 - Museo di Storia Naturale (the Italian word corresponds to BioArt in English). ==References== ==External links== * Pietro Antonio Bernabei's Website Category:Florentine painters Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:BioArtists ",
