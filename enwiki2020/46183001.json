Both Akerman and Santino are irritatingly one- note.\" ===Financial=== On October 21, 2015, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman announced during a Q3 Earnings Phone Call that their original programming lineup last spring resulted in a $42 million dollar writeoff, including season six of Community and Other Space. ==See also== * List of original programs distributed by Yahoo!
