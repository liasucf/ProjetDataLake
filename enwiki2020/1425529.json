    "text": "The Vancouver Courier is a Canadian semiweekly local newspaper published in Vancouver, British Columbia, by the Van-Net chain owned by Glacier Media Group. Currently, it is Canada's largest distributed community newspaper, with a weekly distribution of 265,000. The circulation estimate includes The Vancouver Courier, The Vancouver Courier Downtown, and the Vancouver Courier Westside, and The Vancouver Courier Eastside on Wednesdays. Delivered to homes the paper is distributed from UBC to the Vancouver proper boundary at Boundary Road. The newspaper began as an independent in 1908 as the Eburne News. Within the last 15 years its ownership has had several owners: first, the national Southam Inc. chain, then Hollinger, CanWest, Postmedia, and now Glacier Media. It expanded from being a neighbourhood newspaper to its current citywide circulation area after acquiring the Vancouver Echo and the West End Times. The paper has twice been named \"Best Community Newspaper in B.C.\" and was the second runner-up in the Canadian Community Newspaper Association's general excellence competition. Unlike most community newspapers, which feature several news stories on their front pages, the Courier's Friday front page features a single, lengthy feature that runs over several pages. The paper also frequently publishes material on local Vancouver history, usually written by Lisa Smedman. Columnists include Geoff Olson, Allen Garr, Fiona Hughes and Keith Baldrey. The poet Earle Birney worked at the paper in the mid-1920s as a summer reporter and editor. In April 2020 the Courier announced that they had ceased publication until further notice due to a lack of advertising revenue associated with lower business activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==See also== * Vancouver Sun * Vancouver Province * National Post * List of newspapers in Canada ==References== ==External links== * Official website - The Vancouver Courier * CW Home - CanWest Global Category:Newspapers published in Vancouver Category:Publications established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in British Columbia Category:Weekly newspapers published in British Columbia Category:Biweekly newspapers published in Canada ",
