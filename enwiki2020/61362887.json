He represented Norway numerous times from u-16 through u-20 level, including as a squad member at the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship. He had a stint in Bryne before joining Kvinesdal in 1992, only to move on to the region's top-tier team and reigning league champions Viking FK in the summer of 1992. Recording a maximum of 8 league games during one season, namely in 1993, he went on to Odds BK in 1996. The team secured promotion to 1999 Tippeligaen, but the 1999 season was marred by long-term injury for Rannestad. He played for Mandalskameratene in 2000, before retiring, later featuring occasionally for Kvinesdal IL, now on the seventh tier. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lund, Norway Category:Norwegian footballers Category:Bryne FK players Category:Viking FK players Category:Odds BK players Category:Mandalskameratene players Category:Eliteserien players Category:Norwegian First Division players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Norway youth international footballers ",
