He was the Rabindranath Tagore Professor Emeritus of Indian Cultures and Civilization at Indiana University, Bloomington as well as Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ==Life== Larson obtained his M.Div. in 1963 at the Union Theological Seminary, New York City, and his Ph.D. in 1967 at Columbia University, New York City. He became Rabindranath Tagore Professor of Indian Cultures and Civilization at Indiana University, Bloomington in 1995. He became professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1972, and founding director of the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center there in 1987. He was president of the Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy from 1982 to 1985, and chair of the American Academy of Religion from 1993 to 1999. He published over 100 peer-reviewed articles. He became Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of America in 1993. He died on April 27, 2019. ==Honours and distinctions== In 2018, a volume of essays in Larson's honour, Theory and Practice of Yoga, was published by Brill. In that volume, among many other tokens of respect, Jeffrey S. Lidkey described Larson's \"extraordinary grasp of the textual sources on yogic practice and philosophy\". Reviewing Yoga: India's Philosophy of Meditation edited by Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, Stuart Ray Sarbacker comments that the \"landmark\" volume forms a \"long-awaited sequel\" to their Samkhya: A Dualist Tradition, and among the most important books on the subject in half a century, as in Sarbacker's view it \"represents the culmination of the trajectory of Larson's engagement with the material over the course of his prolific career.\" Reviewing Myth in Indo-European Antiquity, J. Bruce Long called the book a \"splendid collection of scholarly essays\" which took \"the entire field of Indo-European studies into a new and creative era\". ==Works== * 1969 Classical Samkhya: An Interpretation of its History and Meaning.
