    "text": "is a tactical role-playing game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. It was only released in Japan. The game offers a unique soundtrack for each of the many playable \"races\" in the game, and has various levels of gameplay that ranged from arcade Archon-style creature-on-creature combat to strategy similar to Koei's strategy games like Gemfire and Nobunaga's Ambition. Two-player games are also an option, given the variety that the game offered with the occasional arcade action battle to break up the quiet strategy and planning. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ",
