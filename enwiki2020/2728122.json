    "text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Slovakia on 5 and 6 June 1992 alongside federal elections. The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia emerged as the largest party, winning 74 of the 150 seats in the National Council and forming a minority government under Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar. The threshold had been raised from 3% (for the Slovak parliamentary election in 1990) to 5%. In 1993, the Slovak National Party joined the government led by Prime Minister Me\u010diar. After a number of MPs left both parties of the ruling coalition, the Me\u010diar cabinet was brought down by a vote of non-confidence in March 1994. A coalition led by Jozef Morav\u010d\u00edk, the former Czechoslovak and Slovak Foreign Minister, led the country to early elections. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\" | colspan=7 align=center| 350px |- ! colspan=2| Party !
