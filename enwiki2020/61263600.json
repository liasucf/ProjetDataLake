    "text": "Ashley Audrain (born 1982) is a Canadian writer. During a July 2019 interview with the Toronto Star Audrain described her debut novel, The Push, as a \"psychological drama told through the lens of motherhood.\" Prior to turning her hand to writing, Audrain was publicity director for the publisher Penguin Canada. In 2015 a health crisis with her youngest child caused her to retire. She found writing was an occupation she could undertake at home. The Bookseller reports that her UK book deal, with Michael Joseph Limited, a Penguin UK imprint, was worth approximately one million British pounds, while her US book deal was in \"the high seven figures\". The book is scheduled to be published in 2021. ==References== Category:21st-century Canadian novelists Category:21st-century Canadian women writers Category:Canadian women novelists Category:Living people Category:1982 births ",
