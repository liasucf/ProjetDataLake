It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Glangevlin and barony of Tullyhaw. R200 at Legnaderk (geograph 3597120) ==Geography== Legnaderk is bounded on the north by Aghnacollia and Commas (Kinawley) townlands, on the west by Bellavally Upper townland, on the east by Altachullion Lower and Altachullion Upper townlands and on the south by Altnadarragh townland. It is part of the Cuilcagh mountain range and its chief geographical features are Benbeg Mountain (An Bhinn Bheag meaning \u2018The Small Peak\u2019), which reaches a height of 539 metres, mountain streams, waterfalls, forestry plantations and a spring well. The townland is traversed by the regional R200 road (Ireland), minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 357 statute acres. ==History== The earliest surviving mention of the name relates to the Battle of Magh Slecht in 1256 which took place in Legnaderk between the O\u2019Reilly and O\u2019Rourke clans. The Annals of Loch C\u00e9 for that year state- Cath Mhoighe Slecht ar br\u00fa Atha Derg, ag Allt na hellti, \u00f3s Bhealaigh na beithighe, ainm in catha sin (The battle of Magh-Slecht, on the brink of Ath-derg, at Alt-na-helti, over Bealach-na-beithighe, is the name of this battle). The D\u00fachas Folklore collection states- In Cromwell's time the Planters moved through these mountains which they attempted to cross. But the Irish attacked them and drove them back after a fierce battle which was fought in the townland now called Legnaderk - Lug-na-Dearg from the amount of blood spilled. Some say Maguire came to this battle and stayed over-night at 'Maguire's chair'. However this may be a late tradition which confuses the battle with the earlier Battle of Magh Slecht in 1256. In 1720 Morley Saunders was in possession. He leased his interest in Legnaderk to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy by deed dated 24 December 1720.
