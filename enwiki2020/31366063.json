The Hollywood Reporter opined that \"To dazzles with non-stop filmmaking tricks, so many will be happy to forget the disingenuity of the creative premise\". Variety referred to the film as \"tightly plotted and frequently funny, with suave lead perfs and glossy production design and lensing\" while noting that \"this mainstream, mostly Mandarin-language pic is squarely aimed at mainland auds and will do midrange biz in the region, but won't travel much elsewhere.\" ==Theme songs== *\"\u611b\u5f88\u7c21\u55ae\" (Love is Simple) by David Tao (Used by Sean when expressing his love and proposing to Chi-yan) *\"\u6211\u9858\u610f\" (I'm Willing) by Faye Wong (Used by Kevin when expressing his love and proposing to Chi-yan) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * * * Don't Go Breaking My Heart at Hong Kong Cinemagic Category:Hong Kong films Category:2011 films Category:2011 romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong romantic comedy films Category:Chinese romantic comedy films Category:Chinese films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Media Asia films Category:Milkyway Image films Category:Films directed by Johnnie To Category:Films directed by Wai Ka-Fai Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:Films with screenplays by Wai Ka-fai Category:2011 comedy films ",
