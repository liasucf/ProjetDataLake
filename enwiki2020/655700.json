    "text": "Adalbert (1000 \u2013 11 November 1048 in Thuin) was the Duke of Upper Lorraine from 1047 until his death the next year. He was the first son of Gerard de Bouzonville (Gerhard), Count of Metz, and Gisela (Gisella), possibly a daughter of Theodoric I, Duke of Upper Lorraine. Gothelo I, Duke of Lower Lorraine and Upper Lorraine, died in 1044 and was succeeded by his son Godfrey III in Upper Lorraine but was refused Lower Lorraine. Irritated, Godfrey rebelled in that same year and devastated his suzerain's lands in Lower Lorraine. He was soon defeated and Adalbert named in his place in Upper Lorraine. Godfrey continued to fight for all Lorraine and Adalbert died in battle against him at Thuin on 11 November 1048. He had no known children,In 1960, Szabolcs de Vajay hypothesized that Adalbert was count of Longwy and father-in-law of William VII of Aquitaine and William I, Count of Burgundy. (Annales de Bourgogne, Vol 32 (1960) 258-261), and has been followed in this by Frederick Lewis Weis, Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700, Line 144-22. However, de Vajay subsequently published an unqualified retraction of his hypothesis in \"Parlons encore d'Etiennette\" in Onomastioque et Parente dans l'Occident medieval (Prosopographica et Genealogica, no.3), K. S. B. Keats-Rohan and C. Settipani, eds. (2000), pp. 2-6. and Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor immediately nominated his brother Gerhard to succeed him. ==See also== * Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==Notes== Category:Dukes of Upper Lorraine Category:1000 births Category:1048 deaths Category:Military personnel killed in action ",
