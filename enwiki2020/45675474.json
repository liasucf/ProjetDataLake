The Black Parents Handbook was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. In 1979 Clara felt that television was not giving women and minorities the proper recognition but felt working at a station would not give the authority to change such. She, for this reason, filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission who subsequently approved a television allocation to be dropped into Houston (Channel 57), designed to show women and minorities in a more positive manner. While waiting for the petition to be approved, she applied for, built and was able to get on the air, a CBS- affiliated television station in Longview, Texas, making her the first African American female in the U.
