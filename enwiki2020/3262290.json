He was a friend and patron of the poet Ovid, who addressed three letters of his Epistulae ex Ponto (\"Letters from the Black Sea\") to him around AD 10.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto i.6, ii.6, iv.9 He married Asinia, daughter of Vipsania Agrippina and Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus. Pomponia Graecina, wife of Aulus Plautius, was probably his daughter or granddaughter by Asinia. He, or his brother, Lucius Pomponius Flaccus, who was consul in 17 and later imperial Syrian governor in 35, may have married Vistilia, mother of Milonia Caesonia. Milonia Caesonia was later the wife of Caligula, and had two sons: Publius Pomponius Secundus and Quintus Pomponius Secundus. ==See also== *Pomponia (gens) ==References== ==External links== *Pomponius Graecinus from Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology *Augustus and the Senatorial Order Graecinus, Gaius Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:1st-century Romans ",
