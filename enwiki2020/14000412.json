They settle mainly in Sergelen, Bayantu'men, Choibalsan city of the Dornod Province and in Xilin Gol League of the Inner Mongolia. In Mongolia, Some \u00dczemchins migrated there from Xilin Gol immediately after China was freed from the Japanese in 1945. The \u00dczemchin was included the Chahar tumen of the six tumen eastern Mongols in Northern Yuan Dynasty. The land of Ongon-Dural, the third son of Bodi Alagh Khan of the Northern Yuan was called \u00dczemchin. The name probably originates from the Mongolian language word \"uzem\" meaning \"raisin\" as in \"raisin pickers/collectors.\" The \u00dczemchin language is a dialect of Chakhar Mongolian. == References == ==See also== * East Ujimqin Banner * West Ujimqin Banner Category:Mongol peoples Category:Ethnic groups in Mongolia ",
