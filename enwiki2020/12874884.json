    "text": "John Petraglia Sr. (born March 3, 1947) is an American professional bowler. He is a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), where he won 14 PBA Tour titles. He has also won eight PBA Senior Tour titles. He is a member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame.Vint, Bill. \"Roth, Petraglia, Macpherson elected to USBC Hall of Fame.\" == Bowling career == Petraglia joined the PBA in 1965, and won his first tour title at Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1966 when he was just 19 years old. A week later, Petraglia left the PBA Tour to join the United States Army during the Vietnam War. He served as an Army Specialist 5 in Long Binh and Bien Hoa from 1967-68.Article: \"Bowling Hall-of-Famer and Vietnam Vet Johnny Petraglia Joins Bowlers to Veterans Link,\" The Bowlers to Veterans Link, www.bowlforveterans.org His best season as a pro came in 1971, when he won five titles in all. That year included consecutive wins in the last three tournaments of the winter season\u2014culminated by a major championship in the Firestone Tournament of Champions. Petraglia remains the only PBA bowler to win three consecutive televised tournaments. Petraglia would win two more majors: the 1977 BPAA U.S. Open and 1980 PBA National Championship, making him one of only seven players to earn the PBA career \"Triple Crown.\" (Billy Hardwick, Mike Aulby, Pete Weber, Norm Duke, Chris Barnes and Jason Belmonte are the others.) The 1980 event featured one of the more dramatic final matches in major tournament history, as Petraglia rolled four consecutive strikes in the 9th and 10th frames to secure the victory over Gary Dickinson. In 1994, after many figured his regular tour career was over, the 47-year-old Petraglia rolled the PBA's seventh televised perfect 300 game to defeat Walter Ray Williams Jr., 300-194. He did not, however, go on to win the title match that followed. Petraglia is one of only two bowlers (joining Dick Weber) to win at least one regular or Senior PBA Tour title in six different decades.Vint, Bill. \"Johnny Petraglia wins PBA East Senior Regional, Joins Dick Weber with PBA Titles in Six Decades.\" Article at www.pba.com on September 13, 2010. However, Weber's final title was in a PBA Regional event. After his victory in the PBA Senior Dayton Classic on May 17, 2012, Petraglia is the only bowler in history to win a national PBA Tour title in six different decades.Schneider, Jerry. \"Johnny Petraglia Wins PBA Senior Dayton Classic Achieving Milestone of Winning PBA Titles in Six Decades.\" Article at www.pba.com on May 17, 2012. In the qualifying rounds of the 2018 PBA Tournament of Champions, Petraglia announced his retirement from the PBA Tour. However, he is still a brand ambassador for Brunswick and occasionally competes in the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour). ===PBA Tour titles=== Major championships in bold type. # 1966 Fort Smith Open (Fort Smith, Arkansas) # 1970 Bellows-Valvair Open (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) # 1971 Winston-Salem Classic (Winston-Salem, North Carolina) # 1971 Fair Lanes Open (Springfield, Virginia) # 1971 Don Carter Classic (New Orleans, Louisiana) # 1971 Firestone Tournament of Champions (Akron, Ohio) # 1971 Houston-Sertoma Open (Houston, Texas) # 1972 Bellows-Valvair Open (Painesville, Ohio) # 1974 Brunswick World Open (Glendale Heights, Illinois) # 1977 BPAA U.S. Open (Greensboro, North Carolina) # 1978 Long Island Open (Garden City, New York) # 1979 Miller High Life Open (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) # 1979 Midas Golden Challenge (Palatine, Illinois) # 1980 PBA National Championship (Sterling Heights, Michigan) ==Personal== Born in Brooklyn, New York, he now hails from Jackson Township, New Jersey.Staff. \"Hurd and Petraglia the team to beat in Reno\", Professional Bowlers Association.
