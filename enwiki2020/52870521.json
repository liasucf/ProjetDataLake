    "text": "Bident Mountain is a summit in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. With only prominence, Bident Mountain together with Quadra Mountain form an imposing wall in the Canadian Rockies and act as subpeaks of Mount Fay. Bident was first climbed in 1903 by Charles Thompson and Hans Kaufmann. Bident Mountain has the shape of a bident, hence the name. __NOTOC__ ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Bident Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Bident Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 C with wind chill factors below -30 C. ==References== ==External links== * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park ",
