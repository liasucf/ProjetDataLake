    "text": "Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1872 and 1873 for representatives to the 43rd Congress, coinciding with the re-election of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant. Grant's Republican Party increased its majority greatly at the expense of the opposition Democratic Party. The pro- industry outlook of the Republicans appealed to many Northern voters, especially as the post-war economy exploded, and this allowed the party to flourish as the Industrial Revolution grew more widespread. The Republicans also benefited from a continuing association with Civil War victory as well as disarray amongst Democratic leadership. ==Election summaries== Following the 1870 Census, the House was reapportioned, initially adding 40 seats, followed by a subsequent amendment to the apportionment act adding another seat to 9 states, resulting in a total increase of 49 seats. No states lost seats, 10 states had no change, 13 states gained 1 seat each, 9 states gained 2 seats, 3 states gained 3 seats, 1 State gained 4 seats, and 1 State gained 5 seats. Prior to the supplemental act, two states (New Hampshire and Vermont) had each lost 1 seat. This was the first reapportionment after the repeal of the three- fifths compromise by the 14th Amendment. {| style=\"width:100%; text- align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white\" | style=\"background:; width:30.48%\" | 89 | style=\"background:; width:69.52%\" | 203 |- | Democratic | Republican |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=bottom ! rowspan=2 | State ! rowspan=2 | Type ! colspan=2 | Total seats ! colspan=2 | Democratic ! colspan=2 | Republican |- class=small !
