    "text": "The Place Mass\u00e9na in 2008. Massive Police presence in Place Mass\u00e9na just an hour and a half after the Nice Attacks on July 14, 2016 The Place Mass\u00e9na is a historic square in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France. It was named for Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na. Its layout was designed by Joseph Vernier in 1843-1844. The Place Mass\u00e9na is the main square of the city. Before the Paillon River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass\u00e9na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass\u00e9na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of Italian architecture. The recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass\u00e9na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the Corso carnavalesque (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets. The Place Mass\u00e9na is a two-minute walk from the Promenade des Anglais, old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (Jardin Albert Ier). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: avenue Jean M\u00e9decin, avenue F\u00e9lix Faure, boulevard Jean Jaur\u00e8s, avenue de Verdun and rue Gioffredo. ==References== Category:1843 establishments in France Category:Buildings and structures in Nice Category:Squares in France ",
