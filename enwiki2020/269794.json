    "text": "Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) is a volatile hydrazine chemical with the chemical formula CH3(NH)NH2. It is used as a rocket propellant in bipropellant rocket engines because it is hypergolic with various oxidizers such as nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and nitric acid (HNO3). As a propellant, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-27404. MMH is a hydrazine derivative that was once used in the orbital maneuvering system (OMS) and reaction control system (RCS) engines of NASA's Space Shuttle, which used MMH and MON-3 (a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide). This chemical is toxic and carcinogenic in small amounts, but it is easily stored in orbit providing moderate performance for very low fuel tank system weight. MMH and its chemical relative unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) have a key advantage that they are stable enough to be used in regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The European Space Agency (ESA) has attempted to seek new options in terms of bipropellant rocket combinations to avoid poisonous chemicals such as MMH and its relatives.International Conference on Green Propellant for Space Propulsion, European Space Agency MMH is believed to be the main cause of the toxicity of mushrooms of genus Gyromitra, especially the false morel (Gyromitra esculenta). In these cases, MMH is formed by the hydrolysis of gyromitrin. Monomethylhydrazine is considered to be a possible occupational carcinogen,Documentation for Immediately Dangerous To Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the occupational exposure limits to MMH are set at protective levels to account for the possible carcinogenicity.NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A known use of MMH is in the synthesis of Suritozole. == References == Category:Rocket fuels Category:Mycotoxins Category:Hydrazines Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Category:Vitamin B6 antagonists ",
