Yu Ji-ho is a Pharmacist and single dad who graduated a year behind Kwon Gi-Seok from the same University. After a chance meeting at his pharmacy, Ji-ho and Lee Jeong-In start seeing love and relationships in a new light. Lee Jeong-In meets Yu Ji-Ho at the pharmacy when she goes there to remedy her hangover. She tells him she is in a rush and he opens the products and gives them to her before she pays. After drinking, she realizes she has left her wallet at her friend's place. He tells her to just go and pay him back later, and gives her money for a taxi. They exchange numbers and after showing her his kindness, she cannot stop thinking about him even though she is in a long-term relationship with Kwon Gi-Seok. Gi-Seok and Jung-In's parents have been pressuring her to get married even though she is not ready and after meeting Ji-Ho, she feels even more doubtful about marrying Gi-Seok. Ji-Ho becomes interested in Jeong-In after their first meeting, and intentionally does not respond to her texts so that she will come to pay him back instead of wiring him money. When she finally revisits the pharmacy, he implies his interest in her to which she responds that she could only be friends with him. She tells Ji-Ho that she is taken and he tells her that he is a single parent with a son. Later on, they run into each other since Gi-Seok plays basketball with Ji-Ho. Tension builds between the two, as Ji-Ho cannot deny his feelings for her yet she tells him she already has a boyfriend. This contradicts her actions, for there are times that she calls him and wants to meet with him for no apparent reason. Jeong-In becomes conflicted with her feelings as she realizes that she cannot stop thinking about Ji-Ho. As Gi-Seok continues to pressure her about marriage, she becomes even more stressed and tells him the truth that she had been faking love for him for some time and that it was too late for them. ==Cast== ===Main=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
