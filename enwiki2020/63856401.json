Cumberland (1894\u2013June 12, 1938) was a Presbyterian missionary who was killed while living in Dohuk in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Cumberland was born in 1894 in Ventura, California. He served as a field artillery officer for a year between his junior and senior year of college, and enlisted to serve in the First World War in 1917, but the war ended before he was deployed. He graduated in 1919 from Occidental College in Los Angeles and then 1922 from McCormick Theological Seminary. He arrived in Iraq in April 1923 to work as a missionary. His work began with the East Persia Mission, from where he went to Mosul, and afterwards to Dohuk. His New York Times obituary noted that he \"made long trips to the villages of tribesmen, lived with the people and established Christian centers among them.\" The United Mission in Mesopotamia was founded in 1924 by the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the Reformed Church in America, and the Reformed Church in the United States. The mission had two schools: Baghdad High School Mansour, a girls' school in West Baghdad; and the School of High Hope, a boys' school in Basra. In the 1960s, the United Mission established a relief fund in Cumberland's name. His wife Harriet Gilbert Gunn, who he married in 1927, was the daughter of missionaries to the Philippines. They had two daughters. Cumberland considered himself a man of the American West. He is reported to have said, \"The blood of the pioneer is in me. I love the frontier.\" Cumberland left behind numerous letters describing his life in Iraq, which describe meetings with figures including \"the Patriarch of the Nestorian Church, the American Consul Thomas Owens, and an official with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company\". His early time in Iraq coincided with the Barzanji Revolt of 1922\u201324, whose upheavals he reported in his letters. His summary observations about the Kurds were published in a missionary journal in 1926. By 1926, Cumberland had bought a thousand acres of land, including the Assyrian village of Babillu, ten miles east of Duhok. The village reportedly cost $500. By 1936 a military coup had taken place and was followed with the overthrow of that military officer by Nuri al-Said in 1937. Religious liberties began to decline and Cumberland received threats. On June 12, 1938, Cumberland was visited by two men who he talked to for an hour. One was the son of the agha of the village of Besifki, an hour's drive away. When Cumberland went to get a Bible at their request, they shot and killed Cumberland and a servant. According to Dana and Dunn, \"The murder was attributed to religious fanaticism, but the specific motives of the killers were more ambiguous.\" There is some controversy over the rightful ownership of lands which Cumberland gave to Assyrian Christians in the area. It is possible to visit the house in Duhok where Cumberland lived. ==References== Category:American Presbyterian missionaries Category:1894 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Presbyterian missionaries in the Ottoman Empire ",
