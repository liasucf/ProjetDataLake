Bougainville is being built by Huntington Ingalls Industries at its shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi and is expected to be delivered to the U.S. Navy in 2024. Bougainville officially started fabrication on 16 October 2018https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/photo-release-huntington- ingalls-industries-starts-fabrication-of-amphibious-assault-ship-bougainville- lha-8. ==Design== The design of Bougainville is based on , itself an improved version of the . While Makin Island has a well deck, the earlier two Flight 0 America-class ships and were designed and built without a well deck to make space for aircraft and aviation fuel. Bougainville will be the first Flight 1 America-class ship, and as such will include a well deck. The design of the Flight 1 America-class ships, including that of Bougainville, adopts a compromise, incorporating a slightly smaller aircraft hangar as well as smaller medical and other spaces to fit a small well deck for surface connector operations. The island structure will also be modified to free up more room on the flight deck to accommodate maintenance of V-22s, compensating for some of the lost aircraft hangar space. Bougainville will be the first in her class built with a redesigned and stronger main deck; the earlier America- class vessels America and Tripoli each required retrofitting in order to handle the strain of daily Marine F-35B Lightning II STOVL operations. In addition, Bougainville will incorporate the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) volume air search radar in lieu of the AN/SPS-48G air search radar in America and Tripoli. The s starting with and the planned s will also have this radar. ==References== * ==External links== *Huntington Ingalls Shipbuilding: America-class of Amphibious Assault Ships Category:America-class amphibious assault ships Category:Proposed ships of the United States Navy Category:Proposed aircraft carriers ",
