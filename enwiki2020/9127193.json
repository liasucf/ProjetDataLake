By 1936, she had obtained an associate of arts degree from the National University. After passing a civil service examination for nursing superintendents in 1939, Ochoa enrolled in law school. ==First woman member of Congress== In 1937, the right of suffrage was extended to Filipino women after a law allowing the same was approved via plebiscite.

Ochoa handily won the election on November 11, 1941. Ochoa would not have the opportunity to fully serve out her term. Less than a month after her election, the Japanese invasion of the Philippines commenced, and the National Assembly was unable to convene until it was reorganized under the control of the Japanese in 1943. Ochoa nonetheless tried to perform her official duties as a member of Congress. She was active in humanitarian efforts during the Second World War. After the restoration of the Commonwealth government under President Sergio Osme\u00f1a, Ochoa resumed her duties as the duly elected Congresswoman of Agusan. ==Later life== Ochoa's term expired in 1946, and she was not a member of the 1st Congress that was elected in that year.
