Syrian security forces stormed the prison on March 23, 1993, which lead to 72 prisoners burning to death, and the subsequent execution of another five. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant captured the prison in 2015 from Syrian government forces, releasing all inmates. The prison was then used as base by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, before being captured by Syrian Armed Forces during the 2015 battle of al-Hasakah. The prison was captured by Asayish forces during the 2016 battle of al-Hasakah. ==References== Category:Prisons in Syria ",
