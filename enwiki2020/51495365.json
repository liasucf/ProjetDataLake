His goal in the away leg against Enyimba helped his club proceed to the second qualifying round of the 2014 CAF Champions League on away goals., Although Real lost in that round, they were able to qualify for the 2014 CAF Confederation Cup group stage. Ciss\u00e9 signed for Malian champions Stade Malien for the new season. He played and scored for them in the 2015 CAF Champions League, and, as in the previous season, failed to reach the main competition but qualified for the Confederation Cup group stage.

He scored twice in the second match of the season in a 3\u20131 defeat of 2015 runners-up Olympique Club de Khouribga. After some confusion about his destination, Ciss\u00e9 spent the second half of the season on loan at AS Sal\u00e9 of the Moroccan second tier. He joined Albanian Superliga club KF Tirana ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, signing a two- year contract. However, Wydad Casablanca claimed he was still under contract to them.
