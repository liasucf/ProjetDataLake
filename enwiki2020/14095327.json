Ibovi was born in Edou, located in the Oyo District of Cuvette Region, in the north of the country; Edou is also the birthplace of President Denis Sassou Nguesso. He studied journalism in the Soviet Union in the 1970s; after returning, he became a leader of the Union of Congolese Socialist Youth and joined the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in 1977. He worked on national television as a journalist during the 1980s, and he was first elected to the National Assembly in the June-July 1992 parliamentary election as a candidate in Oyo constituency.Philippe Perdrix, \"Fran\u00e7ois Ibovi\", Jeune Afrique, 15 May 2005 . During the June-October 1997 civil war, Ibovi was a spokesman for Sassou Nguesso.Louis Okamba, \"President, former dictator agree to cease-fire\", Associated Press, 5 July 1997.West Africa, issues 4,144-4,159 (1997), page 1,121.

When rebels loyal to Bernard Kolelas attempted to seize Brazzaville, the capital, in December 1998, Ibovi denied Kolelas' claim that his forces were effectively in control of the city, saying that Kolelas was delusional and that the army had the upper hand.\"Congo government denies rebels hold Brazzaville\", BBC News, 20 December 1998. In the government named on 12 January 1999, he remained Minister of Communication and Government Spokesman and was additionally assigned responsibility for relations with Parliament.\"Le nouveau gouvernement du Congo\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 13 January 1999 . In the May-June 2002 parliamentary election, Ibovi was elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate for Oyo constituency;\"Elections l\u00e9gislatives : les 51 \u00e9lus du premier tour\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 5 June 2002 . he was the only candidate\"Elections l\u00e9gislatives : le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Int\u00e9rieur publie la liste officielle des 1 199 candidats\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 14 May 2002 . and won the seat in the first round with 100% of the vote. The elections held in 2002 concluded the transitional process begun in 1997, and Sassou Nguesso formally declared that the transition was over on 9 August 2002. On that occasion, Ibovi said that conditions in Congo- Brazzaville had improved greatly since 1997, progressing from a \"chaotic situation ... to a calm and livable country\".Louis Okamba, \"Congo: Democratic rule restored\", Associated Press, 9 August 2002. Ibovi remained in the government after the election; on 18 August 2002, he was appointed as Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization,\"Old guard, new guard\", Africa Confidential, volume 43, number 17, 30 August 2002.Okamba, La gouvernance, une affaire de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, page 179 . in which position he served for over five years.\"L\u00e9ger remaniement du gouvernement\", Xinhua, 31 December 2007 . Criticism of problems in the conduct of the first round of the June- August 2007 parliamentary election led Ibovi to suspend the Director General for Electoral Affairs, Armand Baboutila, on 28 June 2007 for alleged negligence in the handling of the election;\"Congo: un opposant demande l'annulation du premier tour des l\u00e9gislatives\", Agence France-Presse, 29 June 2007 .\"Top election chief sacked after poll chaos\", Agence France-Presse, 28 June 2007. he appointed Gaston Ololo in Baboutila's place for the second round of the election. Herv\u00e9 Ambroise Malonga, acting as spokesman for parties calling for a boycott of the election, said that higher level officials should take responsibility and called for the resignation of Ibovi and the president of the electoral commission. Ibovi was again elected to the National Assembly as a PCT candidate from Oyo constituency in the 2007 parliamentary election,\"La liste compl\u00e8te des d\u00e9put\u00e9s\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 11 August 2007 .\"Elections l\u00e9gislatives : les 44 \u00e9lus du premier tour\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 2 July 2007 . receiving 99% of the vote.

Having been elected to a post in the Bureau of the National Assembly, it was inevitable that Ibovi would be dismissed from his powerful post in the government; some believed that President Sassou Nguesso was demoting Ibovi as punishment for his widely criticized management of the election.R\u00e9my Bazenguissa-Ganga, \"Congo\", in Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2007 (2008), eds. Andreas Mehler, Henning Melber, and Klaas van Walraven, Brill, page 234.\"Reclassements post\u00e9lectoraux\", Jeune Afrique, 10 September 2007 .

On 31 May 2013, Ibovi announced a new anti-tobacco law that was intended to eliminate smoking in public places, ban the advertising of tobacco products, and prevent children, as well as pregnant women and those suffering from mental illness, from buying or using tobacco products. The announcement of the 2012 law was timed to coincide with World No Tobacco Day.\"Republic of Congo passes anti-smoking law\", Associated Press, 31 May 2013.Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \"Journ\u00e9e mondiale sans tabac : D\u00e9sormais, le tabac est interdit de consommation dans les lieux publics\", La Semaine Africaine, 4 June 2013 . Ibovi visited Cuba on 20-25 June 2013, saying that there was much to learn from Cuba's health system. While there, he signed an agreement that would involve 14 Cuban doctors being sent to Congo-Brazzaville. He also met with Cuban President Raul Castro, giving him a letter from President Sassou Nguesso, and visited medical facilities.Patrick Yandza, \"Fran\u00e7ois Ibovi \u00e0 l'ecole Cubaine\", Le Patriote, number 236, 24 June 2013, page 7 . He visited Cuba again on 25-31 October 2013, and on that occasion he signed agreements with the Cuban industrial group Labiofam as part of a strategy to combat malaria. The agreements involved the construction of a pesticide factory and providing biological larvicides to Congo-Brazzaville.Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \"Minist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9 et de la population : Vers la construction d'une usine de production de pesticides\", La Semaine Africaine, 28 February 2014 .
