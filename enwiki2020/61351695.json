His first season saw Cork win the league, the third year in a row for the side. in 2015, they retained their title with a win over Limerick at Markets Field.

Upon signing for Limerick, Coleman stated that manager Neil McDonald played a huge part in his decision to sign for the club. The season turned out to be a disaster for the club however, as McDonald departed in January before the season started, replaced by Tommy Barrett. The club struggled with financial difficulties which resulted in players leaving in the summer transfer window and ultimately saw the in a relegation fight for the entire season.

Coleman had to wait until 31 May for his first start in the league, also against Cork City, in which he set up Simon Madden's 95th minute equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw. This performance helped Coleman claim his place in Harry Kenny's starting 11 over the next number of games, just before Pats' UEFA Europe League campaign. Coleman got his first taste of European football at senior level as he played both legs of the tie as Pats were knocked out of the UEFA Europa League at the first hurdle by IFK Norrk\u00f6ping of Sweden, losing 2\u20130 at home and 2\u20131 away.
