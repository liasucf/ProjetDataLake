    "text": "In number theory, Zsigmondy's theorem, named after Karl Zsigmondy, states that if are coprime integers, then for any integer n \u2265 1, there is a prime number p (called a primitive prime divisor) that divides and does not divide for any positive integer , with the following exceptions: *, ; then = 1 which has no prime divisors *, a power of two; then any odd prime factors of = must be contained in , which is also even *, , ; then = 63 = 32\u00d77 = This generalizes Bang's theorem, And which states that if and n is not equal to 6, then has a prime divisor not dividing any with . Similarly, has at least one primitive prime divisor with the exception . Zsigmondy's theorem is often useful, especially in group theory, where it is used to prove that various groups have distinct orders except when they are known to be the same.Montgomery, H. \"Divisibility of Mersenne Numbers.\" 17 Sep 2001. ==History== The theorem was discovered by Zsigmondy working in Vienna from 1894 until 1925. == Generalizations == Let (a_n)_{n\\ge1} be a sequence of nonzero integers. The Zsigmondy set associated to the sequence is the set \\mathcal{Z}(a_n) = \\\\{ n \\ge 1 : a_n \\text{ has no primitive prime divisors} \\\\}. i.e., the set of indices n such that every prime dividing a_n also divides some a_m for some m < n. Thus Zsigmondy's theorem implies that \\mathcal{Z}(a^n-b^n)\\subset\\\\{1,2,6\\\\}, and Carmichael's theorem says that the Zsigmondy set of the Fibonacci sequence is \\\\{1,2,6,12\\\\}, and that of the Pell sequence is \\\\{1\\\\}. In 2001 Bilu, Hanrot, and VoutierY. Bilu, G. Hanrot, P.M. Voutier, Existence of primitive divisors of Lucas and Lehmer numbers, J. Reine Angew. Math. 539 (2001), 75-122 proved that in general, if (a_n)_{n\\ge1} is a Lucas sequence or a Lehmer sequence, then \\mathcal{Z}(a_n) \\subseteq \\\\{ 1 \\le n \\le 30 \\\\} (see , there are only 13 such ns, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 30). Lucas and Lehmer sequences are examples of divisibility sequences. It is also known that if (W_n)_{n\\ge1} is an elliptic divisibility sequence, then its Zsigmondy set \\mathcal{Z}(W_n) is finite.J.H. Silverman, Wieferich's criterion and the abc-conjecture, J. Number Theory 30 (1988), 226-237 However, the result is ineffective in the sense that the proof does not give an explicit upper bound for the largest element in \\mathcal{Z}(W_n), although it is possible to give an effective upper bound for the number of elements in \\mathcal{Z}(W_n).P.
