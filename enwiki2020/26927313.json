While attending high school, she excelled in baseball and track and field. As a young girl, she became an avid fan of professional wrestling. After befriending professional wrestler Pat Patterson, he introduced her to The Fabulous Moolah, who agreed to train her despite misgivings about her small stature. == Professional wrestling career == In 1962, Boucher enrolled in The Fabulous Moolah's professional wrestling school in Columbia, South Carolina, training for six months before making her debut. She was given the ring name \"Bette\" by The Fabulous Moolah to appear more exotic. Her first bout was for Jim Crockett Promotions in North Carolina, losing to Penny Banner. After wrestling for two years, Boucher joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. In the late-1960s, Boucher's sister Shirley began wrestling under the ring name \"Rita Boucher\". The sisters spent two years as a tag team before Shirley retired due to family commitments. Boucher defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the NWA World Women's Championship on September 17, 1966. The Fabulous Moolah regained the championship from her one month later. As The Fabulous Moolah was billed as having held the championship uninterrupted for decades, title reigns such as this were not always recognized. Boucher retired from professional wrestling in 1970 to start a family. == Personal life == Boucher married in 1970. She and her husband had four children before divorcing in 1992. ==Championships and accomplishments== *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA World Women's Championship (1 time) ==References== ==External links== Category:1943 births Category:American female professional wrestlers Category:American people of French descent Category:Living people Category:People from Webster, Massachusetts Category:Professional wrestlers from Massachusetts ",
