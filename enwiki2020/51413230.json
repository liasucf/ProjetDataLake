His brother, Alex Stanaway, played rugby league for New Zealand. ==Rugby league career== Alongside his brother Alex, Stanaway was part of the 1908 New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby league tour of Australia. At Ponsonby United's first AGM on 30 July 1909, Stanaway was elected to the club's executive alongside James Carlaw (the first Chairman), Charles Dunning and Arthur Carlaw. Stanaway became a referee in the Auckland Rugby League competition. On 25 June, during a club game, Stanaway sent off Albert Asher. The rest of the City Rovers side walked off in support of Asher. Asher became the first player to face the ARL judiciary, who cautioned him. During the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of New Zealand, Stanaway controlled the Lions matches against Auckland and New Zealand. In 1911 he helped set up the Otahuhu Rovers club, becoming their first chairman. ==Later years== Stanaway died on 23 December 1931. ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1931 deaths Category:New Zealand rugby league players Category:New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby league team players Category:New Zealand rugby league referees Category:New Zealand rugby league administrators ",
