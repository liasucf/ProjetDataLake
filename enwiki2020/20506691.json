    "text": "In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the condensation lemma is a result about sets in the constructible universe. It states that if X is a transitive set and is an elementary submodel of some level of the constructible hierarchy L\u03b1, that is, (X,\\in)\\prec (L_\\alpha,\\in), then in fact there is some ordinal \\beta\\leq\\alpha such that X=L_\\beta. More can be said: If X is not transitive, then its transitive collapse is equal to some L_\\beta, and the hypothesis of elementarity can be weakened to elementarity only for formulas which are \\Sigma_1 in the L\u00e9vy hierarchy. Also, the assumption that X be transitive automatically holds when \\alpha=\\omega_1. The lemma was formulated and proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in his proof that the axiom of constructibility implies GCH. == References == * (theorem II.5.2 and lemma II.5.10) Category:Set theory Category:Lemmas ",
