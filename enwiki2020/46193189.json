During this stage, contestants sing a song or two before a panel of preliminary audition judges. The panel then decides on-the-spot whether the contestant demonstrated enough ability and performance value to proceed further. If the contestant exhibited exceptional ability in their performance, judges \"select\" the contestant to move instantly one step forward in the competition. Alternatively, if judges are on the fence about the singer, they will place the contestant on a waitlist until the end of that day's auditions. Otherwise, if the contestant lacks the ability and performance value to proceed further, the contestant will be rejected. Participating contestants are given chocolate or chocolate biscuits to encourage them to perform. ====Final level auditions==== The final auditions are conducted to select the finalists of each season from the contestants who were selected during open auditions.
