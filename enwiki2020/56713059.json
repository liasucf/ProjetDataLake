    "text": "Joseph John Jefferson (1795\u20131882), usually referred to as John Jefferson, was a British Congregationalist minister and advocate for Christian pacifism. == Biography == Historian Martin Ceadel asserts that Jefferson's pacifist position was most likely inspired by one of his congregants named John Stott. Stott died in 1832 and Jefferson delivered the eulogy. Jefferson was elected as secretary of the London Peace Society on 11 August 1840. In 1845, he spoke publicly in a series of lectures in London sponsored by the Society along with George Thompson, Henry Richard, and John Scoble. The lecture series was attended by a total of 64,000 people. Jefferson hoped they would spread Christian pacifism, specifically opposition to all wars as a Christian principle. In 1846, he was one of the first sixty signers of the League of Universal Brotherhood Pledge, along with Joseph Sturge and James Silk Buckingham. Jefferson retired as secretary of the Peace Society suddenly 4 January 1848 due to poor health. Shortly thereafter in May 1848, he was made vice-president of the Society. He lived for another 34 years and remained an inactive vice president until his death in 1882. == Works == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Citations == == References == * * * * == Further reading == * - A rebuttal of Category:1795 births Category:1882 deaths Category:19th- century Congregationalist ministers Category:British Christian pacifists Category:British Congregationalist ministers Category:British Christian writers ",
