    "text": "Euura viminalis is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Tenthredinidae (common sawflies). The larva feed within galls on the leaves of willows (Salix species). It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. ==Description of the gall== The gall is found on the underside of a leaf of the host plant. It is egg shaped when young, becomes globular as it matures, has brown warts and is usually hairless. It can have a diameter of up to 5 mm and can have a red tinge. On the upperside of the leaf there is a brownish circular depression. The galls can be found on the leaves of osier (Salix viminalis) and purple willow (Salix purpurea). ==Distribution== This species is found in most of south and central Europe north to southern Sweden. It is common in Great Britain and Ireland. ==Inquilines and predators== Three weevils have been found living in the galls, Melanapion mininum, Archarias crux and A. salicivorus. The larva of the chalcid wasp, Eurytoma aciculata lives in the gall and kills the sawfly larvae. The tortricid moth, Gypsonoma dealbana usually feeds on various parts of willow but have been found inside the gall, killing the larvae. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tenthredinidae Category:Gall- inducing insects Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Willow galls ",
