Johnson Jr., former city council member Herbert Fay, and former mayor Grant Conard. Also contesting the race were local merchant John Gillons and banker I. Isaac Irwin. In the campaign, Wilde was accused of being an ineffective mayor, attending less than half of the meetings of Council, and allowing immoral behavior to thrive in San Diego. Wilde contested the allegations claiming that he had been unable to enact his preferred policies due to resistance from the Common Council.
