It is one of three Aloe species that are indigenous to this island, the other two being Aloe perryi and Aloe jawiyon. The natural habitat of Aloe squarrosa is limestone cliff-faces and rocky areas. It is threatened by habitat destruction and is destroyed by goat herding. ==Identification== Aloe squarrosa in cultivation, under the '\"zanzibarica\"' label. Aloe squarrosa has smooth, green, spotted leaves that curve backwards. These recurved leaves are kept only around the head or top of each stem, with dead leaves falling off the lower parts of the stem. The inflorescence is short and simple, and the flowers are light orange with green tips. It is relatively rare in cultivation. It is frequently confused with Aloe juvenna from Kenya. However the commoner Aloe juvenna has shorter, straight, non-recurved triangular leaves and grows long stems, with the leaves retained all along the stems. ==References== squarrosa Category:Endemic flora of Socotra Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by John Gilbert Baker Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour ",
