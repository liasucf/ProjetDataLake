Artigas did this by acquiring the private collections of James LeRoy, Jose P. Rizal, Jose Clemente Zulueta, T.H. Pardo de Tavera, Mariano Ponce and the Tabacalera. Due to his efforts, the Filipiniana collection of the Philippine National Library became one of the most complete collection in Philippine studies.

Apart from these biographies, he also published the multi-volume Galeria de Filipinos Ilustres, a book about important and illustrious Filipinos during that time. Artigas died on April 2, 1925. He was survived by his wife Luisa Losada y Mijares and 12 children. The family was left destitute because it is said that he left them nothing but his books. ==External links== * Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni Category:1925 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:People from Tacloban Category:Spanish-language writers of the Philippines Category:Writers from Leyte (province) Category:Filipino historians Category:Filipino journalists Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni ",
