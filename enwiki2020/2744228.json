    "text": "H\u00f8gnorsk (; meaning High Norwegian), is a term for varieties of the Norwegian language from Nynorsk that reject most of the official reforms that have been introduced since the creation of Landsm\u00e5l. H\u00f8gnorsk typically accepts the initial reforms that, among other things, removed certain silent letters of etymological origin, while keeping most of the Landsm\u00e5l grammar intact. Professor Torleiv Hannaas is often credited for introducing the term 'H\u00f8gnorsk' in an article in 1922. He used it analogously to High German (Hochdeutsch),Hochdeutsch is the linguistic term for the southern and central dialects of German, spoken in the more mountainous parts of the German language area, in contrast to Low German (Plattdeutsch or Niederdeutsch) spoken mainly in the North German Plain. However, non-scientifically, Hochdeutsch (unlike its English equivalent \"High German\") is the common word for \"Standard German\". Scientific German term for Standard German are Neuhochdeutsch (\"New High German\") or Standarddeutsch (\"Standard German\"). pointing out that Ivar Aasen, the creator of Nynorsk orthography, had especially valued the dialects of the mountainous areas of middle and western Norway, as opposed to the dialects of the lowlands of eastern Norway, which Hannaas called flatnorsk (Flat Norwegian, like Plattdeutsch). The written High Norwegian language is a tradition originating from the first version of the New Norwegian written language (then called Landsm\u00e5l), as it was built by Ivar Aasen and later used by classical New Norwegian authors as Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Arne Garborg, Olav Nygard and Olav H. Hauge. The H\u00f8gnorsk movement grew out of opposition to the official Samnorsk policy which aimed at leveling out the differences between Nynorsk and the other main variety of Norwegian language, Bokm\u00e5l. Reforms to this end were carried through in 1938 and 1959. Initially there was considerable resistance against these reforms, but the resulting standard is now widely accepted. H\u00f8gnorsk is currently supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet and the activists behind M\u00e5lmannen, but has relatively few active users. The basis for the High Norwegian language direction, is a wish to preserve the New Norwegian written language as an independent language, free of the strong influence from Bokm\u00e5l that today's New Norwegian has. == References == == External links == Wikipedia Articles in H\u00f8gnorsk on the Nynorsk edition of Wikipedia *, association promoting H\u00f8gnorsk. *M\u00e5llekken, a H\u00f8gnorsk wiki. *H\u00f8gnorskportalen sambandet.no, a resource page with hundreds of articles written in H\u00f8gnorsk. *Tidskriftet M\u00e5lmannen, a magazine promoting the H\u00f8gnorsk language. *Norsk Forml\u00e6ra, a h\u00f8gnorsk grammar. *Norsk Ordlista, a h\u00f8gnorsk dictionary.
