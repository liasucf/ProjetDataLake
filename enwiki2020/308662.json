It is the capital of the new \u00d1uble Region since 6 September 2015. Within the city are a railway station, an inter-city bus terminal, an agricultural extension of the University of Concepci\u00f3n, and a regimental military base. The city includes a modern-style enclosed shopping mall in addition to the multi-block open-air street market where fruits, vegetables, crafts and clothing are sold. The nearby mountains are a popular destination for skiing and hot spring bathing. Founded by the Spanish in 1580 the city persisted despite numerous attacks by Mapuche, Pehuenches and other tribes in war with Spain. Over time Chill\u00e1n became an important marketplace where Mapuches, Pehuenches, Mestizos and Criollos met. Many goods from Patagonia and the Argentine Pampas were brought into the market of Chill\u00e1n across the mountain passes of the area. In the early 19th century the countryside of Chill\u00e1n was ravaged by the Chilean War of Independence and a subsequent banditry epidemic.Villalobos, Sergio; Silva, Osvaldo; Silva, Fernando; Estelle, Patricio (1974). Historia De Chile (14th ed.). Editorial Universitaria. , pp. 406\u2013413 In 1939 the city was devastated by a large earthquake prompting the government to initiate an extensive reconstruction program. ==History== The zone where Chill\u00e1n was built was previously inhabited by indigenous people called Chiquillanes.\\- Chiquillanes, pehuenches y tehuelches, pueblos abor\u00edgenes chilenos Chill\u00e1n was founded in 1580 at the site of Chill\u00e1n Viejo as San Bartolom\u00e9 de Chill\u00e1n by Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa\\- El destino infausto de una ciudad , who was campaigning against the local indigenous peoples at the time. However, this moniker did not fare well, and was replaced by the current name, which in the local Indian language means \"where the Sun is sitting\". During the Mapuche uprising of 1655 the city was besieged by Mapuche warriors.Barros Arana 2000, p. 352. The Spanish defended the city from trenches and a palisade fort.Barros Arana 2000, p. 357. Hoping for a miracle the Spanish put an image of Mary near the trenches which Mapuches are said to have thrown arrows against. In early March, about one month after the onset of uprising, distress was such that the Spanish abandoned the city and headed north escaping the conflict zone. The Real Audiencia of Santiago declared the evacuation an act of cowardice and prohibited refugees from Chill\u00e1n to go beyond Maule River north.Barros Arana 2000, p. 360. As there was an outbreak of smallpox among the refugees this was in effect an quarantine, as threespassing north was punished with death sentences.
