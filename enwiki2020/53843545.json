    "text": "Approaching the starting line on a leg of the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 12 June 2008 The Clipper Round the World Yacht Race was conceived in 1995 by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston and together with William Ward (CEO), founded Clipper Ventures, a company that would run the race. The race takes paying amateur crews on one or more legs of a circumnavigation of the globe in specially designed yachts owned by Clipper Ventures. Three different classes of yacht have been used throughout the race, the Clipper 60, Clipper 68 and Clipper 70s. The race ran every two years between 1996 and 2002, and then skipped a year, with subsequent races beginning in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2017. == Clipper 1996 == === Route === The first race took a route starting from Plymouth and then sailing to Madeira, Fort Lauderdale, Panama, Galapagos, Hawaii, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Seychelles, Durban, Cape Town, Salvador (Brazil), the Azores and back to Plymouth. === Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper '96 Results |- !

Thomson used the win to springboard him into the international racing scene on his Open 60 Hugo Boss. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper '98 Results |- ! Position ! Boat ! Skipper !

The stop in the Azores was replaced by one in New York City and to compensate for the extra distance the Seychelles to Durban to Cape Town leg was reduced to Mauritius to Cape Town. The race attempted to make it from Yokohama to Shanghai but a fierce storm east of Tokyo Bay in March 2001 caused damage to several of the boats and by the time they had returned to Japan for repair, the entry visas to China had lapsed. Instead, the fleet raced from Yokohama to Naha, the capital of the Japanese island, Okinawa. Another diversion took place in May 2001 when mechanical problems to Bristol Clipper\u2019s generator meant the fleet spent two days in Christmas Island and the crews got an unexpected Australian stamp in their passports. In another modification to the Clipper \u201896 and Clipper \u201898 route, stops were included in Vilamoura (Portugal), Singapore and Mauritius with the penultimate race going from New York to the Channel Island port of St. Helier. === Results === The point scoring method was altered, with the races now scoring 8 points for a win, 7 for second and so on. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ The Times Clipper 2000 Results |- !

Three of the boats were renamed, and international cities were now added to the race, Hong Kong, Cape Town and New York. === Route === The start point was moved to Liverpool, and an estimated 40,000 spectators came to see the boats off despite a 24-hour delay due to storms in the Irish Sea. gusts turned the local waters into a boiling maelstrom and the start was postponed from the Sunday until the next day. The race continued to go westwards. As in 2000, the attempt to race into Shanghai failed \u2013 this time thanks to the promised berthing facilities being withdrawn. Further along the route, the fleet was challenged by the SARS virus and the yachts were forced to find an alternative location close to Singapore. The popular Indonesian island of Batam provided the facilities and the stop proved so popular, it was a catalyst for Singapore to enter a yacht in the next running of the race. === Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 2002 Results |- !

After the initial three international boats from the 2002 race, the race was made fully international, with boats sponsored by Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Qingdao, Durban, New York City, Singapore and Western Australia as well as the home teams of Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff and Jersey. === Route === The 2005 race was the first to circumnavigate from east to west. The route was altered to take account of the faster boats, and to take in stopovers at many of the sponsoring cities. For the first time there was a leg across the Southern Ocean between Durban and Fremantle, and a leg across the North Pacific between Qingdao and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The race schedule was significantly altered when Glasgow Clipper reported keel problems in the South China Sea, and diverted to Subic Bay in the Philippines, followed by the rest of the fleet that were showing symptoms, causing an enforced 6 week stopover. The revised schedule dropped the planned stopover in Yokohama from the route, and moved the Caribbean stopover from Cura\u00e7ao to Jamaica. === Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 05\u201306 Leg Results |- ! !

In addition, the race committee did sometimes apply points penalties, invariably for excessive sail damage. The penalty points are shown in brackets after the result. The original race 6, from Singapore to Qingdao was abandoned when the fleet diverted to Subic, and no points were awarded. Liverpool and Singapore were awarded a tie in Race 3, after Liverpool had a GPS failure, and could not confirm its finish time with sufficient accuracy to determine whether it was ahead or behind Singapore. 5.5 points were awarded to each boat. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 05\u201306 Results |- !

There were some changes to the lineup with Victoria, Jersey and Cardiff replaced by Jamaica, Hull & Humber and Nova Scotia. === Route === The race had some changes compared to the 05\u201306 route. La Rochelle was the first stop, replacing Cascais, and the route for Leg 5 changed, with the race leaving Qingdao and heading to Santa Cruz, California via Hawaii, eliminating the stopovers in Yokohama and Victoria. The final leg also changed, with an extra stop in Halifax, and the final pitstop in Cork, rather than Jersey and then finished in Liverpool in July 2008. === Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 07\u201308 Leg Results |- ! !

Race 1 was for half points. == Clipper 2009\u201310 Race == The Clipper 2009\u201310 race started from Kingston upon Hull on the Humber Estuary on 13 September 2009. The race was won by Spirit of Australia on 17 July 2010, when the yachts returned to Hull Marina for a gala celebration. === Fleet === The same fleet of Clipper 68s took part. The yachts were named Hull and Humber, Qingdao, Uniquely Singapore, Cape Breton Island, Spirit of Australia, California, Edinburgh Inspiring Capital, Jamaica Lightning Bolt, Team Finland and Cork. On 15 January 2010, Cork Clipper ran aground on the Gosong Mampango reef in the Java Sea at . In 1992 it was reported that the reef and its associated light lie east of their charted positions. The crew successfully evacuated the yacht and were aided by competitors Team California and Team Finland. Cork Clipper was abandoned a few days later after the decision was made that any attempt to salvage her would be uneconomical. A Challenge 67' yacht Aurora of London was chartered and prepared and re-branded as Cork in Antigua. She rejoined the race in Panama in May 2010, where she was skippered by Hannah Jenner - former 07/08 skipper of Glasgow - Scotland With Style. The Cork yacht was able to finish the race in style as they achieved line honours into their home port of Kinsale, and won the final race from IJmuiden to Hull; winning a second coveted yellow pennant. === Results === For this race, stealth mode was introduced along with scoring gates. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 09\u201310 Leg Results |- ! !

The race saw several yachts suffering steering gear failures, the most severe causing Singapore to retire during the leg to New Zealand. During race 9 from Qingdao to California, an incident on the Geraldton Western Australia yacht made international headlines when the US Coastguard Cutter Bertholf rescued two of the four injured crew from the yacht. === Route === The route was again modified with yachts visiting Eastern Australia and New Zealand for the first time before sailing up to Singapore. === Results === Scoring gates and stealth mode were again features of the 11-12 race. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Clipper 11-12 Leg Results |- ! !
