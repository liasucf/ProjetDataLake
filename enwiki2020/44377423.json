His works depicted various aspects of literature such as mythology, history, social issues, human emotions and politics. ==Details== Dalal painted the portraits of a number of famous personalities including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vinoba Bhave. He created all paintings in the book of \"Raja Shivchtrapati\" written by Babasaheb Purandare which is a classic collection in itself. Dalal also started Deepavali, a magazine published annually during Diwali. This magazine is still in publication, 46 years after his passing. Dalal was also well known for his illustrations in children's books. His style is very easily identifiable and pleasant to the eye. In December 2015 through January 2016, an exhibition was held in Mumbai, India at the Nehru Planetarium commemorating Dalal's centenary year. Additionally, in January 2016, a postage stamp was issued in Goa, India in honor of Dalal's birthplace. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Indian male painters Category:Indian illustrators Category:20th-century Indian painters ",
