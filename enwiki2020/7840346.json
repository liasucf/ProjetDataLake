    "text": "The College of Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the six colleges in the institute. ==History== Until 1990, there was no independent college for the sciences. Before then, there had been three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and College of Science and Liberal Studies (COSALS). As part of his restructuring plan, John Patrick Crecine reorganized the institute; he split COSALS into the College of Sciences and combined the liberal arts and management programs into the Ivan Allen College of Management and Liberal Arts. The latter would be split by G. Wayne Clough in 1998. ==Programs, centers and schools== School of Physics *School of Biological Sciences *School of Chemistry and Biochemistry *School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences *School of Mathematics *School of Physics *School of Psychology *Center for Education, Integrating Science, Mathematics & Computing ==Degrees== ===Undergraduate=== Almost all of the undergraduate degrees offered by the College of Sciences have concentration options and/or a \"business plan.\" * B.S. in Biology * B.S. in Chemistry * B.S. in Earth and Atmospheric Science * B.S. in Applied Mathematics * B.S. in Discrete Mathematics * B.S. in Applied Physics * B.S. in Physics ===Master\u2019s=== * M.S. in Prosthetics and Orthotics * M.S. in Biology * M.S. in Bioinformatics * M.S. in Chemistry * M.S. in Paper Science and Engineering * M.S. in Earth and Atmospheric Science * M.S. with a Major in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences * 5-year B.S.
