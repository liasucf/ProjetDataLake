    "text": "\"DINK\" is an acronym that stands for \"double income, no kids\". It describes a childfree couple living together while both partners are receiving an income; because both of their wages are coming into the same household, they are free to live more comfortably than couples who live together and spend their money on raising their children. The term was coined at the height of yuppie culture in the 1980s. The Great Recession solidified this social trend, as more couples waited longer to have children or chose not to have children at all.Wouter van Gils/Gerbert Kraaykamp, The Emergence of Dual-Earner Couples. A Longitudinal Study of the Netherlands, International Sociology, Jg. 23, 2008, p. 345\u2013366. ==Variations== \"DINKER\" means \"dual (or double) income, no kids, early retirement\". \"DINKY\" means \"double income, no kids yet\". The British radio sitcom Double Income, No Kids Yet bore this name. \"GINK\" means \"green inclinations, no kids\", referring to those who choose not to have children for environmental reasons. \"DINKWAD\" means \"Double income, no kids, with a dog\" Some marketers have proposed \"yappie\" (\"young affluent parent\", adapted from \"yuppie\") as a term to describe similar couples who do have children. ==See also== * Childlessness * Doug, a TV series on which one of the characters has the last name \"Dink\", in reference to the acronym * Emerging adulthood * FIRE movement * Total fertility rate * Voluntary childlessness ==References== Category:Acronyms Category:Family Category:Social class subcultures Category:Words coined in the 1980s ",
