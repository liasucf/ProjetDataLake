It was based on FSO Warszawa, which in turn was based on the Soviet passenger car GAZ-M20 Pobeda. The chassis, suspension and engine from FSO Warszawa formed the basis of the \u017buk and the Nysa light vans designed in the late 1950s. About were manufactured. The \u017buk was mainly sold to state organizations, but also to individuals. After 1989, with the liberalization of the Polish economy, the \u017buk was able to maintain sales to the traditional markets and expand the number sold to individual consumers. The final few years of production was in parallel to its successor, the Lublin van, as a cheaper alternative. The \u017buk came in a range of body styles. The most common were van and light 1.1-ton pickup truck. Rarer variants were minibus and a long-cab truck. Rare for a van, it had independent front suspension. It was very angular, with a number of wide channels running along the side of the body and a completely flat windscreen/windshield. After about ten years in production the front of the cab was restyled, from then on the distinctive side channels no longer continued around onto the front to meet the grille. No further changes were made, except a minor change to the number of vents located above the headlights. The \u017buk was a favourite of farmers, and a common place to find groups of them was at any local market when they were used to transport crops from the fields to the farmers\u2019 own stalls. The Polish postal service (Poczta Polska) used large numbers of \u017buks painted in a dull orange colour, and local fire services used them as personnel carriers or even as mini fire engines in country districts. The \u017buk was shipped to the Soviet Union in the panel van form. ==References== Category:Cars of Poland Category:FSC vehicles Category:Science and technology in Poland ",
