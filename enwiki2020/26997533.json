The company, founded in 1943, is headquartered in Zaragoza, Aragon, where its production plant is also located, The company became famous for the production of highly accurate rocket launchers. Instalaza plant in Zaragoza Instalaza's professional experience is widely noted as a supplier of both the Spanish armed forces and countries around the world. Instalaza has had Pedro Moren\u00e9s Eulate, Secretary of State for Defence between 1996 and 2000, Secretary of State Security from 2000 to 2002, Secretary of State for Science and Technology between 2002 and 2004, and currently Minister of Defense, as representative and consultant. As of 2007, Instalaza SA had 140 employees, a covered plant area of , capital worth more than 5 million Euros, and a revenue of 15 million Euros. ==Cluster munitions ban== The company experienced a crisis in 2008 after the ban on cluster bombs enacted by the Convention on Cluster Munitions. In January 2009, Instalaza still had the MAT-120 cluster bomb in its online catalog. Having been outlawed by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Government ordered the shutdown of the weapon's production in line with its obligations under international law. After a public outcry highlighted by the media, Instalaza ended production of the MAT-120. However a note on the Instalaza website states that the weapon remains in the catalog as a mark of their technological prowess and states that the weapon is in compliance with Amended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. According to the manufacturer, the weapons produces 0.0% 'hazardous duds' by ensuring that in case the munition was not functioning upon impact, it would attempt to self- destruct in 20 seconds. If this was not possible, self-deactivation would occur after 10 minutes. Critics argue that studies based on the Israeli-made M-85, a different type of cluster munition, have indicated that items of unexploded ordnance, whether or not they are armed, remain a serious hazard to civilian populations. However, this type of hazard does not apply to the MAT-120, as if in the rare instance the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, making the dud submunition totally inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.\"Mortars Aim For More Capability\" by Rubert Pengelley, Jane's IDR 1/1997 page 54note2 - the first MAT-120 mortar bomb' submunition were called \"Espin\" by the manufacture and lacked the self-destruction feature, later MAT-120 submunitions with the self- destruction feature were called \"Braco\" Amended Protocol II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of cluster munitions. Instalaza may not sell any patents related to the bomb. Subsequently, the company managed to reorient its production and market new technology. As a result, Instalaza SA continues to produce military equipment for several countries around the world. Instalaza in February 2013, presented its product design and production of arms and ammunition, in the Salon of Defense of Abu Dhabi, with great acceptance by buyers assistants, which reaffirms that the defense and security industry, are among the most active of the highest overall growth of Spanish exports between 2011 and 2013. ===Claimed use of cluster munitions in Libya=== On 15 April 2011, Human Rights Watch and the New York Times documented use of MAT-120 cluster mortar rounds date-stamped 2007 in Misrata, Libya during sustained use of explosive weapons in populated areas by Gaddafi forces, although the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton said she was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata . ==Products== * C90-CR (M3) * Alcot\u00e1n-100 * Alhambra hand grenade * VN-series night vision scopes for rifles and antitank rocket launchers * MAT-120 cargo mortar *FTV Rifle Grenade ==References== ==Notes== This article incorporates information from the revision as of 18 April 2010 of the equivalent article on the Spanish Wikipedia. ==External links== * *Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Fabricantes de Armamento y Material de Defensa y Seguridad Category:Military industry Category:Defence companies of Spain Category:Weapons manufacturing companies ",
