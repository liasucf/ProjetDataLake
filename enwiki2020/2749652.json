He is the only child of Bob Marley with Anita Belnavis, a Jamaican table tennis champion. ==Early life and family== Ky-Mani Marley was born in Falmouth, Jamaica, to Anita Belnavis, a Jamaican table tennis champion; and reggae superstar Bob Marley. At the age of nine, Ky-Mani and Belnavis relocated to the inner city of Miami, Florida. In his early youth, Ky-Mani was unaware of his musical abilities, sports being his first love. With his mother's direction, he received piano and guitar lessons and played trumpet in his high school band. As an athlete, he competed in soccer and American football. ==Career== While a teenager, Ky-Mani started rapping and deejaying. His first single was \"Unnecessary Badness\". He became inspired as a singer after being asked to sing a hook to a song during a recording session at a studio in Miami. Ky-Mani soon began experimenting with laying tracks, at times with his brothers, Stephen, Julian and Damian. Ky-Mani signed to Shang Records where he recorded his debut album in 1996, Like Father Like Son, and several singles: \"Judge Not\" with Patra, followed by \"Dear Dad\" (which topped the British reggae charts), \"Who The Cap Fit (remix)\", and \"Sensimelia\", all of which added to his growing reputation in the new generation of reggae musicians. In 1997, Ky-Mani joined forces with Praswell (Fugees) on \"Avenue\", a hit cover version of Eddy Grant's \"Electric Avenue\". Marley appeared at Midem (international music showcase) when it was held in Miami for the first time. In the Cameo Theatre, Marley performed a set which was aired live by the Caribbean News Agency to 36 countries. Ky-Mani Marley in concert in 2008 Marley became the subject of a bidding war. He signed with Gee Street/V2 Records in 1997 where he completed a collaboration with label mate P.M. Dawn on the single \"Gotta Be Movin' On Up\". Marley's next recording was the 2000 release, The Journey. In 2001, he released his third studio album Many More Roads and went on tour. In 2004 he released his fourth studio album, Milestone. In 2007, he released Radio. In 2015, he released another album, Maestro. Marley's acting work included lead roles in the Jamaican films Shottas and One Love. Married to Janie E.K.
