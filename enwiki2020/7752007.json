    "text": "Hupa traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Hupa, Chilula, and Whilkut people of the Trinity River basin and vicinity of northwestern California. The Hupa people of modern times number in the several thousands and live in the Hoopa Valley located in Humboldt County, California. The oral literature of the Hupa is markedly similar to that of their linguistically unrelated neighbors, the Karuk and Yurok. It differs from the traditional narratives of most California groups, but shows stronger links with the Northwest Coast region of North America. ==Sources== * Bushnell, John, and Donna Bushnell. 1977. \"Wealth, Work and World View in Native Northwest California: Sacred Significance and Psychoanalytic Symbolism\".
