ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich); retrieved 26 April 2020 is an Italian-American computer scientist and holds the Jack Dongarra Professorship in High Performance Computing within the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and an IEEE Senior Member. ==Education== Taufer attended the University of Padua where she obtained a Laurea in Computer Engineering in 1996. She later went on to earn her Ph.D. in computer science at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich) in 2002. The dissertation for her Ph.D. in computer science from ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich) was titled, Inverting Middleware: Performance Analysis of Layered Application Codes in High Performance Distributed Computing, and was supervised by Thomas M. Stricker and Daniel A. Reed. ==Research== Her current research interests include high performance computing, M. Taufer, C. An, A. Kerstens, and C.L.
