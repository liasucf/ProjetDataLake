    "text": "The Hip\u00f3dromo de la Castellana, also known as the Estadio del Hip\u00f3dromo, was a sports facility dedicated to horse racing located on the Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, Spain. The racecourse was opened in celebration of the wedding of Alfonso XII and Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes de Orleans 31 January 1878. It was built by engineer Francisco Boguer\u00edn as one of the first \"official\" and permanent racetracks in the city. The site, now occupied by the office buildings of Nuevos Ministerios, was on the outskirts of Madrid at that time. During its years of operation it was the meeting place of the gentry and aristocracy of the time. The northern extension of the Paseo de la Castellana resulted in the closure of the facility, which was demolished in 1933. The main horse racing venue for Madrid, since the mid-twentieth century, has been the Hippodrome de la Zarzuela. == Football == At the beginning of the twentieth century the Estadio del Hip\u00f3dromo hosted football matches. As a football venue it was replaced by the Campo de O'Donnell, which hosted four finals before it too closed. Matches at the Estadio del Hip\u00f3dromo included: * the 1902 Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n Final (in honour of the coronation of Alfonso XIII, not regarded as part of the Copa del Rey, the Spanish football cup competition)) * the 1903 Copa del Rey Final (the first final of the Copa del Rey) * the 1906 Copa del Rey Final * the 1907 Copa del Rey Final. == Other uses == In some cases air shows were held. == References == Category:Defunct horse racing venues in Spain Category:Defunct football venues in Spain Category:Sports venues demolished in 1933 Category:Former sports venues in Madrid Category:Defunct sports venues in Spain Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Spain Category:Alfonso XII of Spain Category:Former buildings and structures in Madrid Category:Sports venues completed in 1878 ",
