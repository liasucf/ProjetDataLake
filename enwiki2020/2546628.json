The company became part of Adtranz in 1997 as Adtranz Pafawag, and in 2001 part of Bombardier Transportation. It is now part of the company Bombardier Transportation Polska ==History== The factory opened in 1833 as Linke-Hofmann-Werke, Breslau, and became one of the major production centers for rolling stock in Europe. After the end of the Second World War much of the factory had been destroyed, and the city of Breslau became part of Poland, in 1953 the factory was renamed Pafawag In 1953 the factory introduced the EP-02, the first Polish electric locomotive after World War II. In the late 1980s to mid 1990s the factory experienced increasing economic problems due to lack of orders causing loss of production and lower employment. In 1997 ABB DaimlerBenz Transportation (ADtranz) acquired a majority share in the company.* The Adtranz group (after 1999 named DaimlerChrysler Rail Systems) was bought by Bombardier Transportation in 2001; the Wroclaw plant was merged with another Bombardier owned plant based in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to form Bombardier Transportation Polska Sp. z o.o. The plant manufactures the bodyshells of Bombardier locomotives as well as other sub-components for the Bombardier Transportation group. In 2015 Bombardier contracted Panattoni Europe to construct an additional manufacturing hall, initially to be used for the construction of Deutsche Bahn's ICx trains. ==Products== The main products: * locomotives, * bodies, * frames, * running gear for locomotives. PaFaWag also is the producer of first Polish modern \"fast locomotive\" EP09 . ==See also== *Linke-Hofmann ==References== == External links == * * History of Linke-Hofmann-Werke (in German) Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Poland Category:Rail vehicle manufacturers of Poland Category:Companies based in Wroc\u0142aw Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1833 Category:1833 establishments in Poland ",
