Magocsi, \"A History of Ukraine,\" University of Toronto Press, 1996, . ) was a Polovtsian khan of 12th century. == Biography == Polovtses fighting Russian troops, illustration Ivan Bilibin for The Tale of Igor's Campaign ). Respectively son and grandson of the khans Otrok and Sharukan, he unifies in the second half of the 12th century the polovts tribes of the east and made in the years 1170 and 1180 the war against Russian princes; taking advantage of their dissensions, he attacked the principalities of Kiev, Pere\u00efaslavl and Chernigov. His raids were particularly destructive along the Sula River. In 1171, K\u00f6nchek allies with the prince of Novhorod- Siverskyi Oleg II Svyatoslavich, in fight against the other Russian princes but in 1184, during an attack led against the principality of Kiev, his troops was beaten near the Khorol River by the prince Sviatoslav III. The following year, K\u00f6nchek defeats the prince Igor Svyatoslavich who is taken prisoner near the Kaiala River (possibly modern Kalmiius River Volodymyr Kubijovyc, editor. Encyclopedia of Ukraine: Volume II: G-K University of Toronto Press, 758 pages, 1988 , ). This unfortunate campaign of Prince Igor against K\u00f6nchek will become the subject of an epic poem, The Tale of Igor's Campaign . K\u00f6nchek died in 1187. His daughter Svoboda (\"Liberty\" in Russian) married in 1188 Vladimir III Igorevich, son of Prince Igor. In 1203, his son Yuri took Kiev as an ally of the prince Rurik Rostislavich who, chased from Kiev, recruited Polovtses to regain power. == References == == Bibliography == * Martin Dimnik, The Dynasty of Chernigov, 1146\u20131246 , Cambridge University Press, 2003. * Boris Grekov, Aleksandr Yakubovsky, The Golden Horde and Russia: Tatar rule in the XIII and XIV of the Yellow Sea to the Black Sea '.
