The Ruijin Massacre (simplified Chinese: \u745e\u91d1\u5927\u5c60\u6740; traditional Chinese: \u745e\u91d1\u5927\u5c60\u6bba) was a series of massacres that took place in Ruijin and nearby counties in Jiangxi Province during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. From September 23 to early October, 1968, over 1,000 people were killed in the Ruijin Massacre; specifically, over 300 people were killed in Ruijin County, around 270 were killed in Xingguo County, and over 500 in Yudu County. == Historical background == people's communes in Ruijin (August 1968). In May 1966, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in mainland China. The Ruijin Massacre took place during the nationwide campaign of \"Cleansing the Class Ranks\". In August 1968, Cheng Shiqing, then Committee Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of Jiangxi Province, launched the movement of \"Three Investigations Movement (\u4e09\u67e5\u8fd0\u52a8)\" throughout the province, attempting to find out traitors, spies and counter-revolutionaries. The movement caused the deaths of over 10,000 people in total, including 5,000 who were forced to commit suicide. On September 22, 1968, officials from local people's communes were called to a meeting in Ruijin, during which the importance of carrying out the \"Three Investigations Movement\" was emphasized. The meeting also stressed the need of making some \"achievements\" to celebrate the upcoming National Day of the China on October 1. After the meeting, officials in local communes and production brigades began to kill people at will, without any prior need to establish investigative cases, collect evidence, or receive approvals. == The massacre == The Ruijin massacres were conducted by people's communes and production brigades in Ruijin, together with local militia, targeting members of the Five Black Categories as well as their relatives. From September 23 to early October, 1968, over 1,000 people were killed: over 300 people were killed in Ruijin County, around 270 were killed in Xingguo County, and over 500 in Yudu County. The oldest victim was 80 years old, while the youngest was 11. The methods of slaughter included shooting with guns, stoning, beating with clubs, stabbing with knives, pushing over cliffs, and so on. From late September to early October 1968, the situation had grown out of control, forcing the local revolutionary committees to take multiple interventions which gradually ended the massacre. == See also == * Mass killings under communist regimes * List of massacres in China * Cleansing the Class Ranks == References == Category:Cultural Revolution Category:Massacres committed by China Category:Massacres in China Category:Man-made disasters in China ",
