    "text": "The Che\u0142mno Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland since 1454/1466 until the Partitions of Poland in 1772/1795. Together with the Pomeranian and Malbork Voivodeships and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia it formed the historical province of Royal Prussia. Its capital was at Che\u0142mno (). ==History== thumb|left|Prussian lands in 1525 The Land of Che\u0142mno (later known in German as Kulmerland) had been part of the Polish Duchy of Masovia since 1138. It was occupied by pagan Old Prussian tribes in 1216, who struggled against their Christianization instigated by Bishop Christian of Oliva. After several unsuccessful attempts to reconquer Che\u0142mno, Duke Konrad I of Masovia in 1226 called for support by the Teutonic Knights, who indeed approached and started a Prussian campaign, after the duke promised them the unshared possession of the Che\u0142mno territory as part of the Order's State. In the course of the Order's decline after the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, the citizens of Che\u0142mno, Toru\u0144 (Thorn) and Lubawa (L\u00f6bau) joined the uprising of the Prussian Confederation, which sparked the Thirteen Years' War between the Knights and the Kingdom of Poland. After the Order's defeat, the Che\u0142mno Land fell back to Poland according to the Second Peace of Thorn and together with the adjacent Michelauer land in the east formed the Che\u0142mno Voivodeship of the Polish Crown, since the 1569 Union of Lublin part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The voivodeship was annexed by Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, except for the city of Toru\u0144, which was not incorporated into the Province of West Prussia until the 1793 Second Partition. ==Administration== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Che\u0142mno Regional council (sejmik generalny) * Grudzi\u0105dz Regional councils (sejmik poselski i deputacki) * Kowalewo * Radzy\u0144 Administrative division: * Che\u0142mno Land, (Ziemia Che\u0142mi\u0144ska), Che\u0142mno ** Che\u0142mno County, (Powiat Che\u0142mi\u0144ski), Che\u0142mno ** Toru\u0144 County, (Powiat Toru\u0144ski), Toru\u0144 ** Grudzi\u0105dz County, (Powiat Grudzi\u0105dzki), Grudzi\u0105dz ** Radzy\u0144 County, (Powiat Radzy\u0144ski), Radzy\u0144 ** Kowalewo County, (Powiat Kowalewski), Kowalewo * Micha\u0142owo Land, (Ziemia Micha\u0142owska), Lubawa ** Brodnica County, (Powiat Brodnicki), Brodnica ** Nowe Miasto County, (Powiat Nowomiejki), Nowe Miasto Lubawskie ==Voivodes== # Augustyn z Szewy, 1454-1455 # Gabriel Ba\u017cy\u0144ski, 1455-1474 # Ludwik Mort\u0119ski, 1475-1480 # Miko\u0142aj D\u0105browski, 1480-1483 # Karol z Napola, 1484-1495 # Jan D\u0105browski, 1498-1513 # Jan Luzja\u0144ski, 1514-1551 # Stanis\u0142aw Kostka, 1551-1555 # Jan Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1556-1583 # Miko\u0142aj Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1584-1604 # Maciej Konopacki, 1605-1611 # Ludwik Mort\u0119ski, 1611-1615 # Stanis\u0142aw Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1615-1615 # Jan Jakub Wejher, 1618-1626 # Melchior Wejher, 1626-1643 # Miko\u0142aj Wejher, 1643-1647 # Jan Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1647-1648 # Jan Kos, 1648-1662 # Piotr Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1663-1668 # Jan Gni\u0144ski, 1668-1680 # Micha\u0142 Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1681-1687 # Jan Kos (died 1702),1688-1702 # Tomasz Dzia\u0142y\u0144ski, 1702-1714 # Jakub Zygmunt Rybi\u0144ski, 1714-1725 # Franciszek Bieli\u0144ski, 1725-1732 # Jan Ansgary Czapski 1732-1738 # Micha\u0142 Wiktor Bieli\u0144ski, 1738-1746 # Zygmunt Kretkowski, 1746-1766 # Franciszek Stanis\u0142aw Hutten-Czapski, 1766-1802 ==References== Category:Voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Royal Prussia Category:1466 establishments in Europe Category:15th-century establishments in Poland Category:1793 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ",
