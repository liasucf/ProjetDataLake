UC Davis finished the regular season with a record of seven wins and three losses (7\u20133, 3\u20132 NCAC). This was the 22nd consecutive year UC Davis finished with a winning record. The Aggies outscored their opponents 238\u2013215 for the season. The 1991 season was the first time in 21 years the Aggies had not won the NCAC championship. They had won or shared the championship every year from 1971 to 1990. The loss against Chico State broke a streak of 52 consecutive conference wins that started in the 1981 season.
