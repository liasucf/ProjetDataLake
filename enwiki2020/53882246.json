It was commissioned by Barrie and made by Sir George Frampton. The original statue is displayed in Kensington Gardens in London, to the west of The Long Water, close to Barrie's former home on Bayswater Road.https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington-gardens/things- to-see-and-do/memorials-fountains-and-statues/the-peter-pan-statue Barrie's stories were inspired in part by the gardens: the statue is located at the place where Peter Pan lands in Barrie's 1902 book The Little White Bird after flying out of his nursery. Six other casts made by the original artist have been erected in other locations around the world. ==Statue in Kensington Gardens== The sculpture stands about high. It has a tall conical form, like a tree stump, topped by a young boy, approximately life size for an eight year old, blowing a thin musical instrument like a trumpet or flute, sometimes interpreted as pan pipes. The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies. Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of Michael Llewelyn Davies wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood. Barrie was disappointed by the results, claiming the statue \"didn't show the Devil in Peter\".Birkin, Andrew: J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys, Constable, 1979; revised edition, Yale University Press, 2003 Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan in 1906 A completed plaster model of the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in May 1911. Barrie had the original bronze erected in London on 30 April 1912, without fanfare and without permission, so that it might appear to children that the fairies had put it in place overnight. He published a notice in The Times newspaper the following day, 1 May: \"There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning. Down by the little bay on the south-western side of the tail of the Serpentine they will find a May-day gift by Mr J.M. Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around. It is the work of Sir George Frampton, and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived.\" He donated the sculpture to the city of London, although some critics objected to him advertising his works by erecting a sculpture in a public park without permission. In 1928 vandals tarred and feathered the sculpture. It became a Grade II* listed building in 1970. Royal Parks replaced the plinth in 2019, which caused some controversy.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/13/peter-pan-author- would-appalled-pompous-statue-plinth- relatives/https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington-gardens/things-to- see-and-do/memorials-fountains-and-statues/the-peter-pan-statue ==Other casts== Frampton made a series of small bronze reproductions of the Peter Pan figure from 1913 to his death in 1928.
