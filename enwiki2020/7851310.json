In 1563, when an uprising against Ieyasu occurred in Mikawa Province, Masanobu took the side of the peasants against Ieyasu at Battle of Batogahara. He fled from the Tokugawa, rejoining them in the 1570s or 1580s at the behest of \u014ckubo Tadayo, and accompanied Ieyasu as he crossed Iga Province following the assassination of Oda Nobunaga at Honn\u014d-ji. In 1600, Masanobu joined Tokugawa Hidetada's army for the march along the Nakasend\u014d. En route, however, Hidetada attacked Sanada Masayuki at Ueda Castle against Masanobu's advice, and together they arrived late for the Battle of Sekigahara. Masanobu was a member of the Tokugawa shogunate and ruled a Han in Sagami Province assessed at 22,000 koku. He was present at the Siege of Osaka in 1614. Masanobu died several weeks after Ieyasu in 1616. ==References== ==Further reading== Category:1538 births Category:1616 deaths Category:Daimyo Category:R\u014dj\u016b Category:Honda clan Category:Fudai daimyo ",
