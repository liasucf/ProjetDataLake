    "text": "Rebound is a 2005 American sports comedy film directed by Steve Carr. It stars Martin Lawrence as a disgraced college basketball coach who returns to his old middle school to coach the boys' basketball team. This was also Tara Correa's only film role. She was murdered in a gang shooting on October 21, 2005, three months after the film's release. ==Plot== Coach Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence) was once college basketball's top mastermind. His attention began to turn on what endorsement contracts he could secure instead of actually coaching his team. Roy lets his temper get the best of him in most situations. After causing a mishap with a mascot, the board bans McCormick from collegiate basketball until he can show that he can control his anger. Roy's reputation has doomed him to being unhireable as a long time passes with no job offers. However, McCormick then gets one job offer, to Mount Vernon Junior High School, which was also where he graduated as a teenager. His alma mater's basketball team, the Smelters, is looking for somebody to coach the team, and the headmistress thinks an alumnus of his caliber in basketball would be ideal. Although irritated, Roy realizes he has no other options and accepts the coaching job, figuring this is the way to prove he can control his anger and get back into the spotlight of college basketball. As Roy begins coaching the squad, he gets into an embarrassing situation that he's never been in before and decides, enough is enough. He eventually starts teaching the concepts of basketball to his new team, albeit placing paramount emphasis on sportsmanship. With teaching and learning being done between both Roy and the kids, the Smelters eventually start having success. Unexpectedly, this leads Roy to find out he's been missing his simple love of the game the whole time. Eventually Roy gains a new appreciation for his old school and figures that while it does not lead to big money endorsements, he can earn a comfortable living from this job. ==Cast== * Martin Lawrence as Roy McCormick / Don McCormack, Roy's twin brother * Wendy Raquel Robinson as Jeanie Ellis * Breckin Meyer as Tim Fink * Horatio Sanz as Mr. Newirth * Katt Micah Williams as Preacher Don's sidekick * Oren Williams as Keith Ellis, Jeanie's son * Patrick Warburton as Larry Burgess * Megan Mullally as Principal Mary Walsh * Eddy Martin as One Love * Steven C.
