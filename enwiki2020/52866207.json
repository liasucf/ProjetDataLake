    "text": "James Martin Hogle (born July 16, 1951) is an American biophysicist. He is currently Edward S. Harkness Professor at Harvard Medical School, Chair of the Biophysics Program at Harvard University, and faculty dean for Dudley House. ==Early life and education== Hogle was born in Detroit and grew up in Minneapolis, where he lived from the age of 9. After receiving a B.A. in biochemistry from the University of Minnesota, Hogle was accepted to both the oncology program and the biochemistry program at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and chose biochemistry because he was \"afraid (oncology) might be too specialized.\" He interviewed virologist Roland Rueckert, who was not available at the time, and did a summer rotation in the laboratory of pioneering X-ray crystallographer Muttaiya Sundaralingam, where he was \"immediately hooked\" on crystallography. Hogle worked on a number of projects at this lab, and developed an interest in virology. As a postdoctoral student working in Stephen C. Harrison's lab at Harvard, he worked on the structure of turnip crinkle virus and tomato bushy stunt virus, and began investigating poliovirus structure. == Academia == At Scripps Research Institute, Hogle used a three-pronged approach to determine the poliovirus structure: electron microscopy, direct methods, and the heavy atom method. In 1985, at the age of 35, he succeeded in determining the structure of poliovirus using X-ray crystallography. Hogle went to Harvard Medical School in 1991, continuing to work on polio and its close relatives such as herpes simplex virus as well as echovirus and other picornaviruses. ==References== ==External links== *The Hogle Laboratory *Professor Hogle's page at Harvard Medical School Category:American biophysicists Category:Harvard Medical School faculty Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni ",
