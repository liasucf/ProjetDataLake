The response from the public was extremely negative as many believed that the festival should be a \u2018free\u2019 festival for the public to enjoy with family and friends. To express their dissatisfaction towards this, there were Facebook Pages set up, such as \u201cHacking Freespace Fest: 9 play!\u201d which protested against the admission fee. Finally, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority decided to go back to free admission. ==Activities== Activities held during the festivals are similar every year. Their purpose is to promote local arts and culture while allowing participants to relax. Handicraft market: People are allowed to sell handmade products in which they can share their creativity and innovations to others. Areas are not restricted. There are also no regulations for stall owners so as to promote freedom. Literature sharing: Reading club on the grass, Cantonese poetry readings, collaborations of music and poetry are the main events for the exchange of knowledge. It aims at inspiring and sharing ideas on topics with people who share the same interests. Farmers' market: Local farmers are given an area to sell locally produced crops. Organic and healthy products are also provided for purchase. Typically, farmers share their ideas on organic and local farming. This allows citizens who live in urban areas to get a better understanding of farming in our city. Music performances: The organization of the festival invites artists and musicians to perform and collaborate on the stage built for the festival. In 2014, some artists such as Supper Moment, DJ rupture, Mike Orange and so on were invited to the festival. It offers a chance for people to create and exchange ideas. ==Special event== \u201cM.U.R.S.\u201d: In Freespace Fest 2014, an interactive outdoor show \u201cM.U.R.S.\u201d by La Fura Dels Baus from Spain was added to the festival by the organiser. MURS means \u201cwall\u201d in French. It is like a giant- walled city that is divided into four areas: Fortune, Green-living, Well-being and Security. The show requires the audience to use their electrical devices to receive instructions during the show time in order to interact with performers and help complete the show. Tickets are $150 per person or $100 for full-time students or elderly over the age of 65. \u2018Grasscamp\u2019 at Freespace: In Free Space Fest 2014, participants of the event were invited to camp in the West Kowloon Promenade area. This offered a great chance for stressed citizens who were leading hectic lives. For the campers who stayed there overnight, 24-hour music programs were provided for them so as to experience another kind of camping. ==Future== The future of Freespace festival is still uncertain and not intentionally developed by the Hong Kong government as the government set many restrictions to groups and associations who book the area for public recreation. However, the government can consider holding the festival in other open areas, such as Lantau Island and small islands near Hong Kong Island which acquires large public space. As the government is actively arousing the importance of arts to the citizens, this event has a foreseeable future in Hong Kong. ==References== *Official website of Free Space Fest: http://www.westkowloon.hk/en/freespacefest *Facebook page for \u201cHacking Freespace Fest: 9 play!\u201d: https://www.facebook.com/9playfreespace *Information about Free Space Fest: http://www.westkowloon.hk/en/freespacefest/about-freespace-fest *News about Free Space Fest: http://www.westkowloon.hk/tc/newsroom/news/over-43000-visitors-make-west- kowloons-freespace-fest-2014-a-great-success *News about Free Space Fest: http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1028774 *\u201cM.U.R.S.\u201d in Free Space Fest Official Page: http://www.westkowloon.hk/en/murs Category:Art festivals in China Category:Festivals in Hong Kong ",
