    "text": "Red string from near the Western Wall in Jerusalem Wearing a thin scarlet or crimson string (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9, khutt hasheni) as a type of talisman is a Jewish folk custom as a way to ward off misfortune brought about by the \"evil eye\" (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2). The tradition is popularly thought to be associated with Kabbalah and religious forms of Judaism. The red string itself is usually made from thin scarlet wool thread. It is worn as a bracelet or band on the left wrist of the wearer (understood in some Kabbalistic theory as the receiving side of the spiritual body), knotted seven times. The person has to knot it 7 times while saying the kabbalah bracelet prayer. ==In relation to traditional beliefs== Red strings around the wrist are common in many folk beliefs; for example the kalava is a Hindu version. There is no written mention in the Torah, Halacha, or Kabbala about tying a red string around the wrist. It seems to be a custom that has been around since at least the early 1900s. ==Biblical history== A scarlet thread, tied about the wrist, is mentioned in Genesis 38. Tamar becomes pregnant by her father-in-law, Judah, and gives birth to twin boys. The following verses about this event are taken from the King James Bible: ==Modern trend== Today in Israel, it is common to see elderly women peddling scarlet thread for pilgrims and tourists, especially in the Old City of Jerusalem.(Teman, Elly. 2008. \"The Red String: A Cultural History of a Jewish Folk Symbol,\" in: Bronner, Simon J.
