    "text": "Winning Putt was a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMORPG) in which players take on the role of a golfer. Winning Putt is developed by Webzen/Onnet, and Published in North America by Bandai Namco Entertainment America. Winning Putt is a free to play Online PC Golf Game, meaning there is no cost to download and play the game, but features microtransactions. The servers for Winning Putt were shut down permanently on December 14, 2018. == Gameplay == Winning Putt allows up to four players to tee-off together on several fictional golf courses. The game also features a social hub called \"The Square\" where player avatars can interact with other players and buy or sell items from various NPCs, or trade with other players. Players earn experience and gold, an in game currency, with each swing they take, and get bonuses on completing a hole or round of golf. When a player earns enough experience they will advance in level, and after level 5 begin earning training points to further advance their character's statistics. Gold can be used in game for a variety of items which can be purchased from other players or NPC shops. The actual game of golf makes use of a standard 3 click swing bar seen in many other golf games. Players click once to start their swing, again to set power, and a third time to set the accuracy of their shot. Classes can unlock skills by spending their training points in different stats. Skills allow player to change the way a base shot works, allowing players to curve the ball through the air intentionally, or even reduce the effect that flying through a tree can have on a ball. Skills are broken down into three types: Power, Accuracy, and Common. As the names suggest, each class gets their own unique skills while also gaining some from a pool shared between both. Winning Putt currently has 11 Courses of varying difficulty. Each course can be played on five different difficulties, which change the starting tee position, and the pin position. == Development == In-Game Screenshot of the User Interface Winning Putt was originally developed as a Korean title and then later marketed to the United States.
