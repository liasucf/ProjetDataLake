Crichton wrote to his kinsman James Menzies of Weem to send wild fowls and aquavitae (whisky) for the wedding at Barnbougle. He expected his new bride to look after his young daughters from a previous marriage, and was proud of his choice, \"she has many good qualities in weaving, sewing and other handicrafts, wherein she may be helpful to your daughters and mine.\"HMC 6th Report: Menzeis (London, 1877), p. 697 \"for sche hes mony gud qualities in wewing, schewing and uther handie craftis, quherin sche may be helplie to your dochteris and myne.\" She died two years later, after having a daughter Agnes Crichton.Agnes Mowbray, National Records of Scotland Hall of Fame The granite castle was built in 1666 in a modified L-plan design. Little is known of the history of the castle. It was built by George Crichton shortly after his marriage to the only daughter of Sir Robert Douglas of Tilquhillie. == Modern Day == The castle has since fallen into ruin with some stones being taken for construction of nearby farmsteads.
