    "text": "\"Pe-al nostru steag e scris unire\" () is a Romanian patriotic song dedicated to the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia established in 1859. The text was written by Andrei B\u00e2rseanu and the music was composed by Ciprian Porumbescu in 1880. Its tune is now used in the Albanian national anthem. In 1975, after a national contest for a new anthem, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu made this song the national anthem of the Socialist Republic of Romania with lyrics modified by the PCR (Romanian Communist Party) to reference communism and title changed to \"E scris pe tricolor Unire\". However, since Albania already used the song since 1912, \"Trei culori\" (\"Three colors\") was adopted in 1977. On 28 January 2016, Romanian journalist George Roca published an article stating that the anthem of the Dutch city of Maastricht had been copied from \"Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire\". Mestreechs Volksleed, adopted in 2002, had a great similarity to the Romanian song, so Roca compared both songs and the Albanian anthem. He said that, unlike the Albanians which were proud of the Romanian origin of their anthem, the Dutch \"stole\" the hymn even though they blocked Romania from entering the Schengen Area for corruption claims. The controversy had a great impact on Romanian media, where news began to spread in several newspapers, as well as in Wikipedia. Months later, Roca declared satisfaction after seeing the effect that his article had had. ==Lyrics== ===Original lyrics (1880)=== ===Lyrics modified by the PCR=== Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu made the lyrics of this song the national anthem of Romania, but since Albania already used it, it was replaced in 1977.
