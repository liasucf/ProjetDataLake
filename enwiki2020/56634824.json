Led by future Basketball Hall of Fame member Larry Bird, top- seeded Indiana State defeated in the title game, 69\u201359, to win their first MVC tournament title. The Sycamores subsequently received an automatic bid to the 1979 NCAA Tournament, where they would advance to the national championship game. ==Format== Even without any new Missouri Valley members, the conference decreased the size of the tournament field from nine to eight. In turn, only the top eight teams from the conference's regular season standings were included in the bracket. All eight qualifying teams were placed into the first round, seeded and paired based on regular season conference records. The highest-seeded team in each game served as the host. ==Bracket== ==References== Category:Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament Category:1978\u201379 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball season Category:1979 in sports in Indiana ",
