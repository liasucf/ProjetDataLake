It was there that he first developed his interests in painting, theater and antiquities. In 1901, he enrolled at the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, where he studied with and joined the local community of people from Kazanlak, known as \"Rose Valley\", after an area near their hometown. \"Zahasia\" (1924) During this time he also helped establish the \"Department of Antiquities\" at the \"Iskra Town History Museum\" and made his public d\u00e9but with cartoons and illustrations for the local newspapers. Impressed by Professor Anton Mitov's lectures on art history, he began to write art criticism for the newspaper \u0414\u0435\u043d (Today). He became so involved with this new interest, that he failed to attend his final exams at the Academy. He remained in Sofia a bit longer, then went to Munich, spending his days at the Alte Pinakothek, copying the Old Masters. In 1908, he returned home and donated fifteen of them to a new art museum. For the next few years, he exhibited his landscapes at the \"Society of Artists of Bulgaria\" in Sofia, but was not very successful. Instead, he decided to devote his energy to art research and critiques, written for \u041c\u0438\u0440 (Peace), the official organ of the People's Party. Although this required living in Sofia, he continued to participate in the affairs of his hometown. Landscape (1917) In 1914, he entered a contest to create a new curtain for the main theater in Stara Zagora. Although his design was not chosen, it attracted the attention of Geo Milev and, two years later, he was invited to do the scenography for a production of Oedipus Rex. In 1918, he published a book on the ancient monuments of Dobruja. For almost twenty years, he worked as a researcher for the Ministry of Education and Science, producing numerous essays and monographs on Bulgarian art. He also continued to paint, producing portraits of notable figures such as Professor Marin Drinov and the politician . He also designed Kazanlak's first Coat of Arms. In 1927, he published his book of local history \u0420\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043b\u044a\u043a (The Rose Valley and Kazanlak). Following a stroke in 1936, he made a large donation to the art museum there; which included hundreds of books, decorations, costumes, icons and photographs. He died of a second stroke shortly after, while convalescing at the resort city of Burgas. ==Further reading== ===By Enchev=== *\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442 (The Bulgarian Folk Cross), Marin Drinov Publishing, 1994, *\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 (1899-1905) (Diary:Fragments) Penyo Terziev, Plovdiv, 2012 ===By others=== * Marin Dobrev, \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043b\u044a\u043a (Artists of Kazanlak), 2013 * Milena Georgieva, \"\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0415\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0432-\u0412\u0438\u0434\u044e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u043a\u044a\u043c \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\" (His Contribution to Bulgarian Art and Culture) in \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043b\u044a\u043a \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441 (Kazanlak Yesterday and Today), yearbook 1994 #4 == External links == * The Bulgarian Folk Cross online @ OMDA * The Rose Valley and Kazanlak online @ Mediafire (download required) * Kazanlak's Coat of Arms @ Heraldika * \"The Diary of Enchev-Vidyu presented at the Chudomir Museum\" from Kazanlak.com Category:1882 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Kazanlak Category:Bulgarian folklorists Category:Bulgarian illustrators Category:20th-century Bulgarian painters ",
