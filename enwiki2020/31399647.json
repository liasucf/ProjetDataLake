The crosslines are absent, except for the relatively broad white-beige subterminal line and a terminal line marked by black interveinal dots. The reniform stigma is almost invisible and beige, outlined by a few brown scales. The hindwings are unicolorous grey, with a discal spot. The fringe is grey. The ventral surface is light brown. The biotope consists of moist, mainly broad-leaf forest with shrubs and herbaceous plants, close to a river.
