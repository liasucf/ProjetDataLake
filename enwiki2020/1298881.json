This idea was based on stories of his late grandfather that had been passed down. He stated \"We become like gods to those who come after us.\" With this in mind he created a Minecraft mod, Chain World, that was put on a single USB flash drive, which he then passed to an audience member. The rules of the game were simple: No text signs are allowed in the game, players may play until they die once, upon respawning they must quit the game and the game must then be passed onto someone that is interested and willing to respect the rules. ==GDC 2013 Game Design Challenge== In March 2013 the Game Design Challenge was held at the Game Developers Conference for the final time. Its theme was \"Humanity's Final Game.\" Rohrer was among the six contestants and won with his entry A Game For Someone, a physical game constructed of titanium. After its completion Rohrer buried it in an undisclosed location in the Nevada desert. At the challenge he released lists containing over one million discrete GPS coordinates, one of which was the actual burial spot. He estimated that with coordinated searching it would take at least 2,700 years to locate the game. ==The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer== In February 2016, the Davis Museum at Wellesley College exhibited The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer, the first museum retrospective dedicated to the work of a single video game maker. The museum stated \"Rohrer's exhibited work is deft, engaging, and often surprisingly moving. It refers to a diverse set of cultural influences ranging from the fiction of Borges to Black Magic; at the same time, it also engages pressing emotional, intellectual, philosophical, and social issues. Rohrer's substantial recognition, which has included feature coverage in Wired, Esquire and The Wall Street Journal, as well as inclusion in MoMA's initial videogame acquisition, has been built on a singularly fascinating body of games. These range from the elegantly simple\u2014such as Gravitation (2008), a game about flights of creative mania and melancholy\u2014to others of Byzantine complexity. The exhibition featured four large build-outs that translate Rohrer\u2019s games into unique spatial experiences, alongside a section dedicated to exploring a large body of his work.\" The exhibit was designed by IKD,http://www.i-k- design.com a Boston-based design firm. ==Other projects== *konspire2b,http://konspire.sourceforge.net/ a pseudonymous channel-based distributed file system *token word, a Xanadu-style text editing system *tangle, a proxy server which attempts to find relationships between websites and user visits. *MUTE, a file sharing network with anonymity in mind. *Monolith, a thought experiment that might be relevant to digital copyright.
