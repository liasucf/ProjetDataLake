All playoff matchups were in single-leg elimination tournament format with the higher seeded team hosting until the national semifinals. Seeding was determined by league record, with Boston Renegades seeded first with 39 points. The host of the national semifinals was determined by bids at the 2002 USL Annual General Meeting. In the Central and Eastern Conferences, the top two teams from each division played, and then divisional winners played for the conference championship and to advance to the national semifinals. The top two teams in the Western Conference, having only one division, played each other to advance to the W-League Semifinals. The Hampton Roads Piranhas received a bye into the W-League national semifinals as host, with the third-place team from the Atlantic Division receiving a playoff berth. The W-League championship final was televised live on Fox Sports World. ===Conference Brackets=== Central Conference Eastern Conference Western Conference ===W-League Championship Bracket=== ===Divisional Championships=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Conference championships=== \\---- \\---- ===W-League Semifinals=== \\---- ===W-League Third Place=== ===W-League Championship=== ==See also== *United Soccer Leagues 2003 *2003 PDL Season == References == 2003 Women 1 W ",
