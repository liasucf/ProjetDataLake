It was composed by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (1950\u2013) in the years 2007 and 2008.Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. ka\u2013\u1e45a. The work is set in the backdrop of the B\u0101lak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da of V\u0101lm\u012bki's R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Tulas\u012bd\u0101sa's R\u0101macaritam\u0101nasa, and is an assortment of verses describing the activities, pastimes and major events during the childhood of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma. \u015ar\u012bs\u012bt\u0101r\u0101makelikaumud\u012b consists of 324 verses divided in three parts of 108 verses each. The verses are composed in seven Prakrit metres, namely Am\u0101trika, Kavitta, G\u012bta, Ghan\u0101k\u1e63ar\u012b, Caupaiy\u0101, Drumila, and Mattagajendra. A copy of the epic with a Hindi commentary has been published by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University, Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh. The book was released on October 30, 2008. ==Composition== Jagadguru Rambhadracharya mentions in the prologue of the work that he was traveling to Madhya Pradesh from Chitrakuta on November 25, 2007. He was listening to the poetry of Raskhan, being read out by his disciples. After reading some verses, two of his disciples asked him in why he could not compose such lyrical poetry describing the child forms of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma, as Raskhan composed describing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The poet accepted their \"ingenuous yet challenging\" request and composed the first verse almost a month later, on December 23, 2007, in the Kandivali (East) suburb of Mumbai. Till April 2008, he had time to compose just 67 verses of the first part, owing to a busy schedule. Then he happened to travel to Bihar for an 18-day-long Kath\u0101 programme in April\u2013May. The poet completed the remaining 260 verses between April 19 and May 1, 2008 on the banks of the Kamala River in the Mithila region of Bihar. ==The three parts== The work is divided into three parts, called the three rays by the poet. The first ray is set in Ayodhy\u0101 and the subject is the birth (manifestation) of R\u0101ma, followed by the pastimes and events from his childhood. The second ray is set in Mithil\u0101, describing the manifestation, and childhood pastimes and events from the life of S\u012bt\u0101. The first half of the third ray is a description of messages exchanged by S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma through N\u0101rada, and the second half describes R\u0101ma's journey from Ayodhy\u0101 to Mithil\u0101 and culminates with the marriage of the princes of Ayodhy\u0101 with the princesses of Mithil\u0101. Most of the verses describe a sight or activity using various figures of speech, while major events of are R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a are summed up briefly. At the end of each part, after the 108th verse, is a concluding 109th verse in which the poet presents a metaphor for the work, wishing that the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas in the form of cakora birds ever drink the moonlight of \u015ar\u012bs\u012bt\u0101r\u0101makelikaumud\u012b. In Indian literature, the cakora bird is said to subsist on moonbeams only.Monier-Williams 2005, p. 380. This final verse is the same in all the three parts. ===Ray One=== 250px The first ray () begins with an invocation of Sarasvat\u012b and the poet expressing that his only faith is in the infant form of R\u0101ma (verses 1 to 3). Verses 4 to 5 state that it is the very same Supreme God (Para Brahman) who is without any qualities (Nirgu\u1e47a Brahman) that manifests as R\u0101ma who is with qualities (Sagu\u1e47a Brahman). The manifestation of R\u0101ma as an infant from the womb of Kau\u015baly\u0101 on the day of R\u0101manavam\u012b is described in verses 6 to 18, with eight different similes from natural world forming verses 8 to 15. Verses 19 to 22 show R\u0101ma in the care of Kau\u015baly\u0101, while verses 23 and 24 show him in the arms of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, the Guru of the Raghu dynasty. The features of the baby are the subject of the verses 25 to 27. Verses 28 to 30 describe the festivities in Ayodhy\u0101. Verse 31 shows R\u0101ma in the lap of Kau\u015baly\u0101. The N\u0101makara\u1e47a Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra of the four brothers takes place in verse 32, with their features described in verse 33. Kau\u015baly\u0101 and Arundhat\u012b play with R\u0101ma in verses 34 to 38. The next twenty nine verses (39 to 67) show various features, activities and pastimes of the child R\u0101ma, like playing in the mud, bathing, baby talk, curly hair, clothes and ornaments, act of crawling, et cetera. In verses 68 to 70, the child R\u0101ma falls ill and Kaikey\u012b and Kau\u015baly\u0101, thinking it to be the result of a T\u0101ntric charm, call Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha for a remedy. In verse 71, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha chants the Narasi\u1e43ha Mantra and R\u0101ma is cured. Verse 72 shows R\u0101ma in the lap of Da\u015baratha. Verses 73 to 80 form a conversation between Kaikey\u012b and R\u0101ma, where the child R\u0101ma requests Kaikey\u012b for the toy in the sky (the moon) \u2013 Kaikey\u012b makes up several excuses for each of which R\u0101ma has an answer. Once again, in verses 81 to 94, the features, activities and pastimes of the child R\u0101ma are described. In verses 95 to 98, R\u0101ma begins to learn the art of archery, first using a bow made of wooden skewer, and later using an actual bow given by Da\u015baratha. Looking at his prowess with the bow, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha predicts that the boy will grow up to be the slayer of the demons and R\u0101va\u1e47a. Verse 101 shows R\u0101ma playing with his friends on the banks of the Saray\u016b river. The Yaj\u00f1opav\u012bta Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra of the four brothers takes place in verses 102 and 103. In the next four verses (103 to 107), the four brothers go to the \u0100\u015brama of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha to study the Vedas and come back home after their Sam\u0101vartana Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra. In the 108th verse, the four princes are shown in the palace of Da\u015baratha, endowed with knowledge and a virtuous character. ===Ray Two=== The initial verses (1 to 14) of Ray Two () have the region of Mithil\u0101, the city of Janaka and the place of Pu\u1e47y\u0101ra\u1e47ya as their subject. In verses 15 to 23, the manifestation of S\u012bt\u0101 on S\u012bt\u0101navam\u012b day as Janaka ploughs the fields of Pu\u1e47y\u0101ra\u1e47ya is described. The festivities in Mithil\u0101 come next (verses 24 to 28), followed by the description of the infant's features by the women of Mithil\u0101 (verses 29 to 31).

Verse 46 is about her Annapr\u0101\u015bana ceremony. Two more verses on the child's charm (47 and 48) are followed by her Kar\u1e47avedha rite (verse 49), and then another five verses on S\u012bt\u0101's playful activities (50 to 54). Verse 55 describes S\u012bt\u0101 with her three sisters (M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dav\u012b, \u016armil\u0101, and \u015arutik\u012brti) and eight companions. Her play on the banks of the river, with dolls and in the courtyard of Janaka is the subject of verses 56 to 60. In verses 61 to 67, Sunain\u0101 adorns S\u012bt\u0101 with a Sari and other ornaments, thinking about R\u0101ma as her future groom. Verses 68 to 72 once describe S\u012bt\u0101's beauty, charm and glory. S\u012bt\u0101's devotion and love for R\u0101ma is described in verses 73 to 76. Her mixing up with the children of the commoners in Mithil\u0101 form verses 77 to 79. The service of the cows and a painting of R\u0101ma is described in verses 80 and 81. Verses 82 to 89 describe the interactions of S\u012bt\u0101 with the girls, boys and women of Mithil\u0101, along with her daily routine. The way the child S\u012bt\u0101 eats her food is the subject of verse 90. Verses 91 to 100 deal with her love for nature \u2013 the rainy season, the trees and the creepers, and her disapproval of materialism and greed. In verses 101 to 108, the dragging of the Pin\u0101ka by S\u012bt\u0101 is described. S\u012bt\u0101 sees the onerous bow of \u015aiva being worshipped in Mithil\u0101 asks Janaka about it. On learning its history, she drags the bow and plays with it like a toy horse, to the great amazement of Janaka. ===Ray Three=== 250px Ray Three () begins with the description of a young S\u012bt\u0101 in verses 1 to 5. In verses 6 to 9, the sage N\u0101rada visits S\u012bt\u0101 in Mithil\u0101 and carries a message from her to R\u0101ma in Ayodhy\u0101. The description and glory of Ayodhy\u0101 is the topic in verses 10 to 14. In verses 15 to 20, the sight (Dar\u015bana) of the child R\u0101ma playing with his friends and brothers is described, as seen by N\u0101rada. The conversation between N\u0101rada and R\u0101ma happens in verses 21 and 22. This is followed by S\u012bt\u0101's message to R\u0101ma in verses 23 to 31. In verses 32 and 33, R\u0101ma sends a message in reply to S\u012bt\u0101 through N\u0101rada, the contents of which are in verses 34 to 42. N\u0101rada returns to Brahmaloka in verse 43.

In verses 52 and 53, S\u012bt\u0101 ordains \u015aiva to reveal the R\u0101marak\u1e63\u0101stotra to sage Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra writes the Stotra as dictated by \u015aiva in his dream and goes to Ayodhy\u0101 in verse 54. The sight of R\u0101ma by Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra is forms the verses 55 to 58. In verses 59 to 63, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra asks Da\u015baratha for R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, who is first distraught over the demand but is then convinced by Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. Nine events of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a between the brothers departure from Ayodhy\u0101 and their arrival in Mithil\u0101 with Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra are briefly summarized in verse 64.

Early morning on the next day, R\u0101ma requests Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra to allow the brothers to get flowers for his service (verses 72 to 77). The next three verses (78 to 80) show the two brothers in the garden of Janaka. From verse 81 to 87, the conversation between R\u0101ma and the gardeners of Mithil\u0101 is described.
