    "text": "Saint Hoax is a pseudonymous Syrian artist, satirist and socio-political activist. They use various mediums to subversively depict political and popular figures. They're also known for taking Disney characters out of context and using them for social awareness. They have been known to mainly feature and capitalize on American Pop culture while living abroad. They have been focusing less and less on their surrounding Middle East culture. == Career == === Political satire === ==== War Drags You Out ==== War Drags You Out is a series of digital illustrations depicting prominent political and religious figures as drag queens. The project was shared on January 2014, and it is the first to be published under the pseudonym Saint Hoax. The artist received multiple death threats shortly after publishing the project due to his inclusion of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Osama bin Laden in the series. The depiction of the late king and bin Laden offended religious extremists and made the artist a target for criticism and death threats. Some of the threats were publicly shared on Hoax's social media accounts, others were sent directly to his email address. However, the project was well received by the media and praised as a strong political commentary. === Social awareness === ==== Happy Never After ==== In 2014, Saint Hoax published their campaign Happy Never After. The artist used images of Disney princesses to spread awareness about domestic violence. The princesses were illustrated with bruises on their faces and a slogan that read \"When did he stop treating you like a princess?\" accompanied the visuals. Hours after the posters were published on the artist's website, the campaign went viral. Happy Never After became one of the most shared domestic violence campaign. In November 2014, it was used as the official anti-domestic violence campaign in Amsterdam. ==== Once Upon A War ==== In March 2016, Saint Hoax visited a Syrian refugee camp in Akkar, Lebanon and photographed Syrian girls dressed as Disney princesses. This was a collaborative project with Plastik Magazine, Beirut based visual magazine, and MALAAK, an Akkar-based NGO that builds schools for Syrian refugees and provides aid. The proceeds of the project went directly to MALAAK. == Social Media == Saint Hoax uses social media, particularly Instagram, as their main platform.
