His father, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War, was Clerk of Naval Affairs to the U.S. House of Representatives.

He received his early education in Washington, D.C., graduating from the William McKinley Manual Training School in 1903. He studied privately under Nathan Wyeth of Washington, D.C., a graduate of the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris. In 1905, he entered the office of the Supervising Architect of the United States, where he remained four years, part of which time was devoted to architectural work at the Panama Canal. == Paris == Baumer resigned his position with the Supervising Architect to go to Paris, where he was admitted to the Ecole des Beaux Arts in June 1911, and received into the Atelier Bernier-Pontremoli. For several years he worked in the Ecole, traveled extensively in Europe, and became associated with Achille Duch\u00eane. While with Duch\u00eane he worked on several large projects executed in the United States, including the Parkway scheme for Philadelphia, the Widener Estate near Philadelphia and the setting for the Municipal Art Gallery of Philadelphia. This work was in charge of Jacques Greber, architect of Philadelphia.
