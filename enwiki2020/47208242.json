Frizzy-haired Janos (Sven-Olof Molin) is already mid-aged but has no jobs and no aspirations. He sings ballads on the street with a guitar and picks the garbage for food, yet he is content with his carefree life. He sometimes helps out old man Stig Manner (Rolf G. Ekroth) who walks with a cane to sell used goods. Obviously unsatisfied with Janos' lack of achievements, Stig tries hard to launch a musical career for him. He calls himself Janos' manager and takes Janos to different places for performing and recording opportunities, but Janos is completely disinterested which frustrates him. Around this time, Stig receives a voice mail from his estranged daughter Catrin (Helena Bengtsson), who has arrived in town from Stockholm with her infant son. Stig is afraid to meet his daughter, but sends her a CD with Janos' recordings. He has a stroke and becomes wheelchair-bound. Janos discovers Stig has a daughter who only wants to meet Stig to introduce him to her son. He puts Stig on a train to Stockholm and calls Catrin. ==Awards and nominations== * 2011 Film Festival del Garda (Italy) - Audience Prize * 2011 Festival Internacional de Cine en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (Mexico) - Best Actor, Rolf G.
