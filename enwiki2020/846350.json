Hirayama tries to find out more about Taniguchi from his subordinate. Owing to the standoff, his daughter's friend Yukiko (Fujiko Yamamoto) tries a ruse in which she asks Hirayama's opinion concerning a similar situation \u2013 her mother forcing her to marry someone she didn't like. When Hirayama advises her to ignore her mother, Yukiko reveals it is all a setup and states that Hirayama has just given his consent to Setsuko's marriage. Despite the ruse, Hirayama remains unchanged and Hirayama's wife Kiyoko (Kinuyo Tanaka) accuses her husband of being \"inconsistent\". Even his younger daughter Hisako (Miyuki Kuwano) is on the side of her sister, finding her father too old-fashioned. Finally, after the couple's insistence on getting married, Hirayama decides to give in by attending his daughter's wedding.

Ozu chose Agfa film from Germany over Kodak or Fujifilm, as he felt that it conveyed red colors better. The meaning of \"equinox flower\" or \"higanbana\" of the title is the red Lycoris. Shochiku requested that Ozu shoot Equinox Flower in color primarily to showcase Fujiko Yamamoto, the Daiei superstar it had borrowed for the film. The movie is constructed to spotlight the actress, who is elevated with extended dialogue scenes as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hirayama who drives the plot resolution from the sidelines, and she won the 1958 Blue Ribbon Award as Best Actress for Equinox Flower and The Snowy Heron, which featured her in a much showier starring role. Yamamoto also receives what may be the only solo screen credit in any of Ozu's films, which starred some of the biggest names in Japanese cinema. ==Release== ===Critical reception=== Equinox Flower garnered 88% approval on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.4/10. Dave Kehr praised the film as \"gentle, spare, and ultimately elusive, in a quietly satisfying way.\" Equinox Flower received four votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the world's greatest films. ===Home media=== In 2011, the BFI released a Region 2 Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD). Included with this release is a standard definition presentation of There Was a Father. == References == ==External links== * Rotten Tomatoes Reviews * * * 1970 version of Japanese film poster *Equinox Flower at Ozu-san.com Category:1958 films Category:Japanese films Category:Films directed by Yasujir\u014d Ozu Category:Shochiku films Category:Films with screenplays by Yasujir\u014d Ozu Category:Films with screenplays by Kogo Noda ",
