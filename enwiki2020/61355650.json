    "text": "Stumptown Athletic is an American professional soccer team that plays in the National Independent Soccer Association (NISA). The club is based out of Matthews, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte. ==History== The club's name comes from an early nickname for Matthews derived from the fact that farmers cut down so many trees to clear land that the town was left full of tree stumps. For a time, little was known about the club, and it was referred to in league press releases simply as \"Charlotte\". The club's name was officially unveiled in June 2019. The team is owned by Christopher Clarke of Atlanta, a lawyer specializing in wealth management, and Casey Carr, a former college soccer player with the DePaul Blue Demons and an entrepreneur based out of Mecklenburg County. Carr serves as the club's president and GM. On July 21, 2019 the club appointed Mark Steffens as head coach. Steffens previously coached the Charlotte Eagles and served as an assistant for the Charlotte Lady Eagles. ==Stadium== For the 2019 NISA Fall Showcase the team will split time between the CSA OrthoCarolina Sportsplex in Pineville and the Sportsplex at Matthews. Club management views the Sportsplex at Matthews as the team's long- term home. ==Players and staff== ===Current roster=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#1B3A68; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #CD3237;\" scope=\"col\"|No. ! style=\"background:#1B3A68; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #CD3237;\" scope=\"col\"|Position ! style=\"background:#1B3A68; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #CD3237;\" scope=\"col\"|Player ! style=\"background:#1B3A68; color:#FFFFFF; border:2px solid #CD3237;\" scope=\"col\"|Nation |- |} ==Year-by-year== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! rowspan=\"2\" |League ! rowspan=\"2\" |Div. ! rowspan=\"2\" |Pos. ! rowspan=\"2\" |Pl. ! rowspan=\"2\" |W ! rowspan=\"2\" |D ! rowspan=\"2\" |L ! rowspan=\"2\" |GS ! rowspan=\"2\" |GA ! rowspan=\"2\" |Pts. ! rowspan=\"2\" |Playoffs ! rowspan=\"2\" |U.S. Open Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Top goalscorer ! rowspan=\"2\" |Manager |- !
