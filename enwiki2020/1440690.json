    "text": "View of Soho Square in 1992 Soho Square is a garden square in Soho, London hosting since 1954 a de facto public park let by the Soho Square Garden Committee to Westminster City Council. It was originally called King Square after Charles II. Its statue of Charles II has stood since the square's 1661 founding (one year after the restoration of the monarchy) except between 1875 and 1938; it is today well-weathered. During the summer, Soho Square hosts open-air free concerts. Of its 30 buildings (including mergers) 16 are listed (have statutory recognition and protection). By the time of the drawing of a keynote map of London in 1746 the newer name for the square had gained sway. The central garden and some buildings were owned by main heirs to the Dukedom of Portland's great London estates.'Soho Square Area: Portland Estate, Soho Square Garden', in Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho, ed. F H W Sheppard (London, 1966), pp. 51-53. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols33-4/pp51-53 [accessed 13 November 2018]. At its centre is a listed mock \"market cross\" building completed in 1926 to hide the above-ground features of a contemporary electricity substation; small, octagonal, with Tudorbethan timber framing. During the king's statue's absence through intercession of resident business Crosse & Blackwell it was a private garden feature at Grim's Dyke, a country house where it was kept by painter Frederick Goodall then by dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame. Initial residents were relatively significant landowners and merchants. Some of the use remains residential. From the 1820s to 1860s at least eleven artists recently qualified for major exhibitions were resident aside from permanent residents, some of whom were more accomplished artists, as comprised in the local rate books; by the end of that century charities, music, art and other creative design businesses had taken several premises along the square. A legacy of creative design and philanthropic occupants lingers including the British Board of Film Classification, 20th Century Studios UK, Dolby Europe Ltd, Tiger Aspect Productions, Saint Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church which provides many social outreach projects to local homeless and addicts, the French Protestant Church of London (by architect Sir Aston Webb) and the House of St Barnabas a members' club since 2013 which fundraises and hosts events and exhibitions for homeless-linked good causes. ==History== Monmouth House in Soho Square was built for the Duke of Monmouth.

The statue of Charles II by Caius Gabriel Cibber stands at the centre of Soho Square Built in the late 1670s, Soho Square was in its early years one of the most fashionable places to live in London. It was originally called King's Square, for King Charles II. The statue of Charles II was carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber during the King's reign in 1681 and made the centrepiece of the Square; since it has returned it has not been in the centre. The development lease to convert the immediately surrounding fields, for years, was granted in 1677 to Richard Frith, citizen (elector of the Corporation of London) and bricklayer. Ratebooks (of the vestry) continued to call the square King Square until the first decade of the 19th century, however John Rocque's Map of London, 1746 and Richard Horwood's in 1792\u20139 mark it as Soho Square. By the early 19th century, the statue, fountain and attendant figures was described as 'in a most wretched mutilated state; and the inscriptions on the base of the pedestal quite illegible'.\"Soho Square Area: Portland Estate: Soho Square Garden\" in Survey of London volumes 33 and 34 (1966) St Anne Soho, pp. 51\u201353.

Goodall placed the statue on an island in his lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained when dramatist W. S. Gilbert purchased the property in 1890, and there it stayed after Gilbert's death in 1911. In her will, Lady Gilbert directed that the statue be returned, and it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.Photo of the statue William Thomas Beckford was born on 29 September 1760 in his family's London home at \u2116 22\\.

After the 1880s the rate of change was considerably faster. Between 1880 and 1914, 11 of the 38 old houses in the square were rebuilt or considerably altered. The majority of the new buildings provided office accommodation only and the residential, mercantile and manufacturing elements in the square declined.

It is believed that their house is modelled on the House of St Barnabas which Dickens used to visit, and it is for this reason that the street running behind the House from Greek Street is called Manette Street (it was formerly Rose Street). Joseph Addison and Richard Steele wrote of their character Sir Roger de Coverley in The Spectator, \"When he is in Town he lives in Soho-Square.\" In the song \"Why Can't The English?\" from the musical My Fair Lady, Professor Henry Higgins laments, \"Hear them down in Soho Square/Dropping H's everywhere.\" In the novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke, the eponymous Jonathan Strange and his wife Arabella maintain a home in Soho Square as their residence in London.http://hurtfew.wikispaces.com/Jonathan+Strange The Soho Square garden contains a bench that commemorates the singer Kirsty MacColl, who wrote the song \"Soho Square\" for her album Titanic Days. After her death in 2000, fans bought a memorial bench in her honour, inscribing the lyrics: \"One day I'll be waiting there / No empty bench in Soho Square\".
