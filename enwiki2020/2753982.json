This exam is provided by Lifelong Learning Promotion Division, Lifelong Learning Policy Bureau, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, started in 2005 as the replacement of the which were held until 2004 in Japan. The University Entrance Qualification Examination has been accepted for many universities in Japan, such as Japan's most prestigious University of Tokyo because MEXT has been encouraging post-secondary educations to recognise the certificate. However, it is looked down upon by some employers and universities in the United States and other countries as a lower form of degree than an actual high school diploma. The certificate is meant to certify that the bearer has an academic ability equivalent to a graduate of an upper secondary school. The passing rates of this exams are about 30% to 40% every year. For 2014, there are about 37.1% of students who had passed this examination. == Awardees == Individuals who are or will become 16 years old during the academic year (April to the following March) can take this exam. However, those who are awarded the certificate can not enter a university until they become 18 years old since the certificate is with the proviso that no qualifications until he or she becomes 18 years old. There is an educational exception for one who is 17 years old or older, and is recognised by the university, that he or she has an outstanding skill or talent in a certain field of study that the university specified, can enter the university. This exception can be applied for universities only and not for other educational institutions. Unlike the GED in the United States or Canada, in Japan, the majority taking the exam are truant students, although there are many who did not go to high school for various other reasons. Truancy in students has become one of the most serious problems in Japan, often with its roots in bullying and harassment. There is one truant for every 50 students in elementary school and that number makes up approximately 130,000 children who are refusing to go to school, and miss an average of 18 months to two years of class, according to the recent study by MEXT. This examination gives them the opportunities to be certified that they have an academic ability equivalent to graduates of high school (upper secondary school) and apply for university and taking any examinations which require high school graduation. == Subjects == The taker must take between 8 and 10 subjects to get the certificate. === Required === * Japanese * Math * English === Options === The takers must choose one subject from each category (with the exception of Civics and Science). * World History ** World History A ** World History B * Geography and History ** Japanese History A ** Japanese History B ** Geography A ** Geography B * Civics (The takers must choose either Contemporary Society or Ethics & Politics and Economy.) ** Contemporary Society ** Ethics ** Politics and Economy * Science (The takers must choose either Science and Our Daily Life and one other subject with Basic in its name or three subjects with Basic in their name.) ** Science and Our Daily Life ** Basic Physics ** Basic Chemistry ** Basic Biology ** Basic Earth Science ==See also== * GED * Education in Japan == External links == * MEXT: Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT Official website, in English) * MEXT's Major Policies (Higher Education) (MEXT Official website, in English) Category:Testing and exams in Japan ",
