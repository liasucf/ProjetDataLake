    "text": "The Apu\u00ed Mosaic () is a protected area mosaic in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. ==Location== The Apu\u00ed Mosaic is divided between the municipalities of Apu\u00ed (91.85%) and Novo Aripuan\u00e3 (8.15%) in the state of Amazonas. It covers an area of . The mosaic is accessible by air to Apu\u00ed, by land via the BR-230 Trans-Amazonian Highway or by boat via the Madeira River to the city of Novo Aripuan\u00e3 and then to the conservation units via the Aripuan\u00e3 River. The mosaic contains the Guariba and Sucunduri State Parks; Bararati and Aripuan\u00e3 sustainable development reserves; Guariba Extractive Reserve; and Sucunduri, Aripuan\u00e3, Apu\u00ed and Manicor\u00e9 state forests. The mosaic, together with the Juruena and Campos Amaz\u00f4nicos national parks, forms a contiguous block of of protected areas known as the Southern Amazon Ecological Corridor, which covers parts of southern Amazonas, northern Mato Grosso and southwestern Par\u00e1. These are areas with strong deforestation pressure due to expansion of the agricultural frontier into the Brazilian Amazon. ==History== The Apu\u00ed Mosaic was created by decree 55 of 12 March 2010 under the responsibility of CEUC in the border region between the states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1. The advisory board was created by the same decree. The management plan was approved on 22 September 2010. The plan was treated as the plan for each of the nine conservation units as well as for the mosaic as a whole, on the basis that the units represented a pre-zoning of the mosaic into areas with different objectives and types of use. The integrated plan would help correct errors in delimitation of the units as better information was obtained, and would prevent actions in one unit having negative effect on another unit. ==Environment== The mosaic includes terra firma forest, flooded forest, campos rupestres, campina and campinarana. It contains the headwaters of the Acari and Sucunduri rivers. The Monte Cristo rapids and the Falls (Saltos do Rio Sucunduri) are well-known attractions. The region has more than 13 endemic species of primates. Surveys of the west of the mosaic have identified 850 tree species, 46 mammals, more than 300 birds, 27 reptiles, 30 amphibians and almost 100 species of fish. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:2010 establishments in Brazil Category:Protected area mosaics of Brazil Category:Protected areas of Amazonas (Brazilian state) ",
