    "text": "In mathematics, specifically number theory, Granville numbers are an extension of the perfect numbers. ==The Granville set== In 1996, Andrew Granville proposed the following construction of the set \\mathcal{S}: :Let 1\\in\\mathcal{S} and for all n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},\\;n>1 let n\\in{\\mathcal{S}} if: ::\\sum_{d\\mid{n},\\; d A Granville number is an element of \\mathcal{S} for which equality holds i.e. it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors that are also in \\mathcal{S}. Granville numbers are also called \\mathcal{S}-perfect numbers. ==General properties== The elements of \\mathcal{S} can be -deficient, -perfect, or -abundant. In particular, 2-perfect numbers are a proper subset of \\mathcal{S}. ===S-deficient numbers=== Numbers that fulfill the strict form of the inequality in the above definition are known as \\mathcal{S}-deficient numbers. That is, the \\mathcal{S}-deficient numbers are the natural numbers for which the sum of their divisors in \\mathcal{S} is strictly less than themselves: ::\\sum_{d\\mid{n},\\; d ===S-perfect numbers=== Numbers that fulfill equality in the above definition are known as \\mathcal{S}-perfect numbers. That is, the \\mathcal{S}-perfect numbers are the natural numbers that are equal the sum of their divisors in \\mathcal{S}. The first few \\mathcal{S}-perfect numbers are: :6, 24, 28, 96, 126, 224, 384, 496, 1536, 1792, 6144, 8128, 14336, ... Every perfect number is also \\mathcal{S}-perfect. However, there are numbers such as 24 which are \\mathcal{S}-perfect but not perfect. The only known \\mathcal{S}-perfect number with three distinct prime factors is 126 = 2 \u00b7 32 \u00b7 7 . ===S-abundant numbers=== Numbers that violate the inequality in the above definition are known as \\mathcal{S}-abundant numbers. That is, the \\mathcal{S}-abundant numbers are the natural numbers for which the sum of their divisors in \\mathcal{S} is strictly greater than themselves: ::\\sum_{d\\mid{n},\\; d {n} They belong to the complement of \\mathcal{S}. The first few \\mathcal{S}-abundant numbers are: :12, 18, 20, 30, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 102, 104, ... ==Examples== Every deficient number and every perfect number is in \\mathcal{S} because the restriction of the divisors sum to members of \\mathcal{S} either decreases the divisors sum or leaves it unchanged. The first natural number that is not in \\mathcal{S} is the smallest abundant number, which is 12. The next two abundant numbers, 18 and 20, are also not in \\mathcal{S}. However, the fourth abundant number, 24, is in \\mathcal{S} because the sum of its proper divisors in \\mathcal{S} is: :1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 24 In other words, 24 is abundant but not \\mathcal{S}-abundant because 12 is not in \\mathcal{S}. In fact, 24 is \\mathcal{S}-perfect - it is the smallest number that is \\mathcal{S}-perfect but not perfect. The smallest odd abundant number that is in \\mathcal{S} is 2835, and the smallest pair of consecutive numbers that are not in \\mathcal{S} are 5984 and 5985. ==References== Category:Number theory ",
