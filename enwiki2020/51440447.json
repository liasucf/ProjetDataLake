He is a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016, representing the electorate of Namatjira until 2020 and Electoral division of Gwoja thereafter. He is of Aranda and Gurindji descent. ==Early years and career== Paech grew up in Alice Springs. He is the son of an Eastern Arrernte woman, his father is a descendant of German immigrants. He was elected to the Alice Springs Town Council in 2012. Paech completed his secondary education at Anzac Hill High, Alice Springs, Northern Territory.

Paech is the only openly gay male MP in the NT Legislative Assembly; before entering politics, he was a prominent LGBT rights activist. ==Politics== Paech was preselected as the Labor candidate for Namatjira for the 2016 Territory election. The seat's incumbent since 2005 (dating to when the seat was known as MacDonnell), independent Alison Anderson, was retiring after three terms. On paper, Paech faced daunting odds. The seat had a notional Country Liberal Party majority of 20.8 percent, and a redistribution had seemingly consolidated the CLP's hold on the seat by pushing it into Alice Springs. However, Anderson, who had served under four banners during her tenure (Labor, CLP, independent, Palmer United and independent again) endorsed Paech as her successor; she is a longtime indigenous activist, and retained substantial goodwill in the area. The ABC's Antony Green believed that Anderson's endorsement made Namatjira \"a certain Labor gain.\"Green, Antony. NT election preview. ABC News, 2016-08-08. Paech won the seat resoundingly, taking 59 percent of the two-party vote on a swing of over 29 percent, the second-largest swing of the election\u2014enough to revert Namatjira to its traditional status as a safe Labor seat. He was subsequently made Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. Paech is the first openly gay indigenous MP in Australia. He gave his maiden parliamentary speech on 19 October 2016, in which he said he entered the chamber \"eternally proud of who I am and where I come from ... I am young, I am gay, I am black; a true-blue Territorian. I am a proud face of the diversity and future of the great Australian Labor party.\" He added: \"I look forward to the day when this country will recognise my rights as equal rights, when I too can marry in my country, on my country, as a recognised first Australian.\" In June 2020, Paech was elected Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, replacing Kezia Purick who resigned after findings of corrupt conduct against her by the Northern Territory Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. He won the new seat of Gwoja at the 2020 Territory election.
