It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell;German Beer Institute, PILS the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named pils, pilsner and pilsener after Pilsner Urquell.University of Economics Prague, Brewery tour of Pilsner Urquell The brewery name, Pilsner Urquell, which can be roughly translated into English as \"the original source at Pilsen\", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in Czechia and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad. The brewery was part of the SABMiller group of companies (at first South African Breweries) from 1999 to 2017. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in October 2016, Pilsner Urquell (excluding certain geographical areas) was sold to Japan based Asahi Breweries in March 2017. == History == Pilsner Urquell Brewery main gate The brewery was founded in 1839 by both local Czech-speaking and German-speaking citizens in Bohemian city of Plze\u0148 as (citizens' brewery, later translated to M\u011b\u0161\u0165ansk\u00fd pivovar in Czech). The first beer was brewed here in 1842 by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. In 1859, \u201cPilsner Bier\u201dPlze\u0148sk\u00fd Prazdroj, a. s was registered as a brand name at the local Chamber of Commerce and Trade. In 1869, a competitor was founded as a joint stock company, later known as Gambrinus. In 1898 the German trademark Urquell and Czech trademark Prazdroj were created, to underline the claim of being the older, original source of Pilsner beer. In 1932 M\u011b\u0161\u0165ansk\u00fd pivovar merged with Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 aciov\u00e9 pivovary. In 1946, the brewery was nationalized under the name Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 pivovary (Pilsen breweries). After the fall of communism in late 1989, the brewery was turned into a public share company, then renamed in 1994 after the Czech name of their famous beer, Plze\u0148sk\u00fd Prazdroj. In 1999, they started to merge with Pivovar Radegast a.s. and Pivovar Velk\u00e9 Popovice a. s..
