The CEAP's vision is to enhance \"natural resources and healthier ecosystems through improved conservation effectiveness and better management of agricultural landscapes.Conservation Effects Assessment Project | Technical Resources | NRCS The goal is \"to improve efficacy of conservations practices and programs by quantifying conservation effects and providing the science and education base needed to enrich conservation planning, implementation, management decisions, and policy.\" A conserved watershed in the United States ==Soil Water Assessment Tool== The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. It is a river basin scale model used to quantify the impact of land management practices in large watersheds. This tool is located in Grassland, Soil and Research Laboratory in Temple, Texas.SWAT: Soil and Water Assessment Tool ==Sustaining the Earth's Watersheds-Agricultural Research Data System== Sustaining the Earth's Watershed-Agricultural Research Data Systems (STEWARDS) was created by a group called the Watershed Assessment Studies a team within the CEAP. STEWARDS is a system that consists of a database to allow users to search and analyze various watershed conditions. The anticipated benefits include data preservation, faster data access, and improved ability to collaborate research between watersheds. ==Watersheds affected== *Mahantango Creek Experimental Watershed in Pennsylvania *Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho *Little River Experimental Watershed in Georgia *Little Washita River Experimental Watershed in Oklahoma *Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona ==Partnerships== Lead USDA agencies *Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) which works to reduce soil erosion while also enhancing water supplies and improving water quality.NRCS Conservation Programs | NRCS *Agricultural Research Service which is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s research department.ARS : About ARS *National Institute of Food and Agriculture another section of the USDA.About NIFA *Farm Service Agency(FSA), a government agency that equal serves farmers, ranchers and agricultural partners through agricultural programs that benefit all Americans.History and Mission *U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)is an impartial science organization that provides the public with information on the ecosystems and environment.About USGS *United States Fish and Wildlife Service a bureau within the Department of the Interior their goal is to conserve and enhance fish, wildlife, and plants.About the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service *USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) is the primary source for economic information and research within the USDA. *USDA Forest Service manages national forests and public grasslands.US Forest Service - About Us *U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s mission is to protect the environment as well as human health.
