    "text": "Loryma () was an ancient town and episcopal see of ancient Caria, in Asia Minor (Anatolia, Asian Turkey). It is now listed as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 918 Loryma was a fortified place with a port, close to Cape Cynossema, on the westernmost point of the Rhodian Chersonesus, in Caria. Its harbour was about 20 Roman miles distant from RhodesSeneca, Quaest. Nat. 3.19; and was belonging to the Rhodians.Appian, Civil Wars, \u00a74.9.72 Strabo applies the name Loryma to the whole of the rocky district, without mentioning the town. The Larumna of Pomponius Mela and the Lorimna of the Tabula Peutingeriana perhaps refer to Loryma, although it is also possible that they may be identical with a place called Larymna mentioned by Pliny in the same district. == Location == Loryma was a small fortified town and harbour on the coast of Caria, not far from Cape Cynossema, at the western extremity of the peninsula known as Rhodian Chersonesus, opposite to and twenty Roman miles from Rhodes island.Sophrone P\u00e9trid\u00e8s, \"Loryma\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) It was a fortified and was belonging to the Rhodians. Its ruins, west of Port Aplothiki, with towers, tombs and ramparts are described by William Martin Leake (Asia Minor, 223).William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) Above the bay of Loryma (modern Bozuk B\u00fck\u00fc) lie the ruins of a curtain wall surrounding the top of the hill. Constructed from large blocks of stone shaped in-situ, the remaining walls (up to several metres high on the outside) retain very precise corners and sheer faces. == Ecclesiastical history == Up to the 12th and 13th centuries, the Notiti\u00e6 episcopatuum mention Loryma as one of the suffragan sees of the Stauropolis, the metropolitan see of Caria. Le Quien names three bishops of Loryma: *George, present at the Council of Constantinople in 680 *Anthimus at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 *Joseph at the Council of Constantinople in 879. The see also exists as a titular see in the Catholic Church.

The wind could be heard > howling outside, against the hills that enclosed our sheltered water as if > it were a mountain tarn. Only a fanning ripple touched the centre. The sound > of the wind, inarticulate and busy like the world\u2019s voice, gave an illusion > of safety, of an unassailable peace. If it could penetrate, how many > sleeping echoes would it waken? Athenians from Samos, dodging the Dorian > Cnidus, picking up ship\u2019s tackle at Syme, sheltering at Loryma; Conon, > before the battle, with his ninety ships; the Roman fleet that dared not > face Hannibal in the offing; Cassius, gathering forces against Rhodes, > twenty miles away. Each in their turn passed through the narrow opening and > felt the sudden calm. In these places, the natural features have remained > unaltered; the moments that visit them, fashioned to one pattern by nature > itself, drop like beads on a string, through long pauses, one after the > other, into the same silence.Freya Stark, The Lycian Shore (Tauris Parks > Paperbacks 2011), pp. 100\u2013101 (originally published in 1956) == Gallery == File:Loryma Citadel from the sea - 6 Jun 2013.jpg File:Loryma Citadel round blocks from outside wall, 6 Jun 2013.jpg File:Loryma Citadel tower blocks from inside wall, 6 Jun 2013.jpg File:Loryma Citadel wall section, 6 Jun 2013.jpg ==References== Category:Catholic titular sees in Asia Category:Populated places in ancient Caria ",
