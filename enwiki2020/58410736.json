    "text": "Curt Miller, shown here accepting the 2017 WNBA Coach of the Year Award, was also the league's first Executive of the Year, winning that award in the same season. The WNBA Basketball Executive of the Year Award is an annual Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) award first presented after the league's 2017 regular season. The winner is selected at the end of the regular season by a panel consisting of one executive from each of the WNBA's 12 teams, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place. Panel members are not allowed to vote for themselves. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third- place vote is worth one point. The person with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Executive !
