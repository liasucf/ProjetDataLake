    "text": "Survivor guilt (or survivor's guilt; also called survivor syndrome or survivor's syndrome and survivor disorder or survivor's disorder) is a mental condition that occurs when a person believes they have done something wrong by surviving a traumatic or tragic event when others did not, often feeling self- guilt. The experience and manifestation of survivor's guilt will depend on an individual's psychological profile. When the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) was published, survivor guilt was removed as a recognized specific diagnosis, and redefined as a significant symptom of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It may be found among survivors of combat, epidemics, murder, natural disasters, rape, terrorism, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations. ==History== Survivor guilt was first identified during the 1960s. Several therapists recognized similar if not identical conditions among Holocaust survivors. Similar signs and symptoms have been recognized in survivors of traumatic situations including combat, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, air-crashes and wide-ranging job layoffs.JoNel Aleccia, \"Guilty and stressed, layoff survivors suffer, too\", NBC News, December 15, 2008 A variant form has been found among rescue and emergency services personnel who blame themselves for doing too little to help those in danger, and among therapists, who may feel a form of guilt in the face of their patients' suffering. Stephen Joseph, a psychologist at the University of Warwick, has studied the survivors of the capsizing of the MS Herald of Free Enterprise which killed 193 of the 459 passengers. His studies showed that 60 percent of the survivors suffered from survivor guilt. Joseph went on to say: \"There were three types: first, there was guilt about staying alive while others died; second, there was guilt about the things they failed to do \u2013 these people often suffered post-traumatic 'intrusions' as they relived the event again and again; third, there were feelings of guilt about what they did do, such as scrambling over others to escape. These people usually wanted to avoid thinking about the catastrophe. They didn't want to be reminded of what really happened.\" Sufferers sometimes blame themselves for the deaths of others, including those who died while rescuing the survivor or whom the survivor tried unsuccessfully to save.Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P. Lab. Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention, SAGE, 2010, p. 33, ===Survivor syndrome=== Survivor syndrome, also known as concentration camp syndrome (or KZ syndrome on account of the German term '), are terms which have been used to describe the reactions and behaviors of people who have survived massive and adverse events, such as the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.Walt Odets, \"In the Shadow of the Epidemic: Being HIV-Negative in the Age of AIDS\", 1995. In 1949, Eddy de Wind, a Dutch psychiatrist and survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp introduced the term \"concentration camp syndrome\" regarding the psychological consequences of persecution, describing the \"pathological after-effects\" unique to former prisoners of Nazi concentration and extermination camps. The subsequently well-documented syndrome among Holocaust survivors includes anxiety and depression, intellectual impairment, social withdrawal, sleep disturbance and nightmares, physical complaints and mood swings with loss of drive. Several studies have examined the \"chronic and progressive\" nature of the condition, with symptoms increasing in intensity as survivors age.Raphael Beverley, (1986). When disaster strikes. pp. 90-91. Century Hutchinson, London. Commonly such survivors feel guilty that they have survived the trauma and others \u2013 such as their family, friends, and colleagues \u2013 did not. Both conditions, along with other descriptive syndromes covering a range of traumatic events are now subsumed under post-traumatic stress disorder.Wilson JP, & Raphael B Editors. Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations of Traumatic Stress Syndromes. The International Handbook of Traumatic Stress Syndromes, p. 1. Plenum Press, New York. 1993. ====AIDS survivor syndrome==== AIDS survivor syndrome refers to the psychological effects of living with the long-term trajectory of the AIDS epidemic and includes survivor's guilt, depression, and feelings of being forgotten in contemporary discussions concerning HIV. While AIDS survivor syndrome has not been recognized as a pathologizable illness by the NIH (as of December 2017), scientific research and publications are available that address this issue. ==Examples== === Holocaust === Holocaust survivor Primo Levi was haunted by his experiences in Auschwitz and explored his survivor's guilt extensively in his autobiographical books, notably in I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved). Towards the end of his life he suffered from depression, and his death may have been suicide. === Elvis Presley === In an interview on Lifetime TV's Unsolved Mysteries, Lawrence \"Larry\" Geller, one of Elvis Presley's closest friends, reported that Elvis, as a twinless twin, was plagued by guilt over the death of his brother, Jesse Garon, who was stillborn. Elvis had confided to Geller about his concerns that maybe he had absorbed more than his share of the nutrients while he was developing inside his mother's womb, causing his twin brother to starve to death before he was born. Elvis had also related to Geller about how his mother had tried to comfort her son by assuring him that \"they would all meet in Heaven\" after their lives on Earth were completed. === Waylon Jennings === Waylon Jennings was a guitarist for Buddy Holly's band and initially had a seat on the ill-fated aircraft on The Day the Music Died on February 3, 1959. But Jennings gave up his seat to the sick J.P. \"Big Bopper\" Richardson, only to learn later of the plane's crash. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said, \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up.\" Jennings responded, \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\" This exchange of words, though made in jest at the time, haunted Jennings for the rest of his life.VH1's Behind the Music \"The Day the Music Died\" interview with Waylon Jennings. === Stoneman Douglas High School shooting === Sydney Aiello survived the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, in which her close friend was killed. Aiello subsequently struggled with survivor's guilt, and she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. On March 17, 2019, Aiello died by suicide at the age of 19. A week later, on March 24, 2019, Coral Springs police announced that a juvenile male student from Stoneman Douglas High School had been found dead as a result of an apparent suicide. ==Cultural references== *Numerous episodes of The Twilight Zone series including \"King Nine Will Not Return\" and \"The Thirty Fathom Grave\" explored the topic of survivor guilt. *The 1979 novel Sophie's Choice and the subsequent movie feature a Polish Holocaust survivor who had to choose which one of her two young children was allowed to survive. *In the 1980 film, Ordinary People, based on the novel of the same name, Conrad Jarrett is a young man who struggles with surviving a sailing accident which killed his older brother.
