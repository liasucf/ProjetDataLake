    "text": "Ukrainian Republic is one of the names of the independent Ukrainian state today known as Ukraine. This name may refer to this state in one of its periods of development of state structures in different regions by some or other governments: * Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Soviet Republic, Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, 1917\u20131919; * Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian People's Republic, 1918\u20131921; * Ukrainian Republic as West Ukrainian People's Republic, 1918\u20131919; * Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, 1919\u20131937; * Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, 1937\u20131991; * Ukrainian Republic as modern Ukraine from 1991; An issue to consider is that while different political forces in 1917-1923 years used different names for the Ukrainian Republic, ordinary people of Ukraine at the time regarded it as singular, newly born republic but with an unstable, overlapping governments. All of these states form a continuous history from 1917 until present day Ukraine. ",
