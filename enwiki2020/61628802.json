It has a highly eccentric (e\u22430.84) orbit which takes it from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune, which classifies it as an eccentric Jupiter and it has been nicknamed the \"whiplash planet\" and \"Planet Pi\". It was discovered in 2019 based on two decades of radial velocity observations. ==References== == External links == * Astronomers find bizarre planet 'unlike any other discovered so far', Cnet, AUGUST 27, 2019 * HR 5183, SIMBAD4 * Planet HR 5183 b, exoplanet.eu * In the Presence of a Wrecking Ball: Orbital Stability in the HR 5183 System, Stephen R.
