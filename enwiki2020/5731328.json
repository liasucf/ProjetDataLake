This is the second time the lead pair worked together after the success of their last film, Hum Tum (2004). It was directed by Siddharth Anand, who directed Salaam Namaste (2005), also starring Khan, and also wrote Hum Tum. The film was a hit at the box office in India and was one of the highest-grossing films of 2007. The film is inspired by Days of Thunder (1990) and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) though film critic Rajeev Masand pointed out that \"the plot has been borrowed generously from films such as Cinderella Man, In America and Life Is Beautiful.\"\"Masand\u2019s Verdict: Tara Rum Pum\" == Plot == Rajveer Singh (Saif Ali Khan) has an immense passion for racing and dreams of making it big on the racing scene. After being discovered by his manager Harry (Jaaved Jaffrey), he meets Radhika 'Shona' Shekar Rai Banerjee (Rani Mukerji) and instantly falls for her. He joins Speeding Saddles, a race team that\u2019s been struggling. He wins his first race and keeps winning, making him wealthy. As the months pass, what started as innocent love blossoms into a serious relationship. Radhika is a great pianist, majoring in music at Columbia University, whereas Rajveer has no degree or any educational background, which earns the disapproval of Radhika's father, Subho Shekhar Rai Banerjee (Victor Banerjee). However, Radhika leaves her father and marries RV, whom she loves immensely. She forgets about her degree and takes on her job as a wealthy housewife, therefore Radhika Shekar Rai Banerjee turns into Shona. Their family is complete with the birth of two beautiful children, Priya a.k.a. Princess (Angelina Idnani) and Ranveer a.k.a. Champ (Ali Haji). Luck follows RV and he has soon proclaimed the number one race car driver in the USA. His rival in profession Rusty, quite jealous of his name and fame, crashes his car into RV's whilst racing, getting him hospitalized for a few months. His injury lasts for a year, in which he is unable to race. Once RV gets permission to race, he heads straight to the track to race again but soon learns that he's scared of going fast because he doesn't want to get hurt again. His old accident haunts him to his nerves and he comes last in every race onwards. Exasperated, Billy Bhatia (Bharat Dabholkar), the manager of the team RV race on, fires him and hires Rusty instead. Angry, RV tells Harry that he doesn't need him anyway and that he can find some better manager easily. This results at the end of their friendship. After a year has gone by, neither RV nor Shona have jobs. They try their best to find work but no one will hire them because of their lack of degrees, making them regret Shona's father's words. RV and Shona are unable to pay their loans and bills, and thus, everything they own in their house is auctioned. Princess and Champ who are not told much, start to worry that they're becoming poor and RV covers up the truth by telling them they're actually on a reality show, Don't Worry, Be Happy. This lets them rest but then they suffer more. With only about $2,000 left, RV and family leave their big house and find a less expensive one. They move into a one-bedroom apartment, and the children become worried again. RV and Shona tell them this is all part of the game and the kids believe them. They still go to their favorite school while their parents try to find jobs. A few days later, RV, tries sending the dog away. Harry comes to meet RV and Shona the next day and brings Bruno back and offers RV a job of a cab driver. RV thinks he's insulting him of his poverty and lack of his racing talent which results in a heated argument between the two and RV asks him to leave. Days pass and Shona gets a job as a piano player and RV becomes a taxi driver, after much arguing. One day when RV and Shona start fighting, Princess overhears them and learns the truth that they actually are in trouble with money and that there's no reality show. She wants to take things in her own hands and then plans to save up the money she and Champ are given for lunch. The plan is that they don't eat lunch and save the money they are given for it. Princess manages to do so, but Champ begins to starve. He takes food from the garbage bin without his sister's knowledge and eats it outside of school on a bench. He keeps eating from the garbage while Princess keeps saving money. Princess makes Champ promise not to tell their parents a single thing, knowing they'll get upset. RV gets a customer who needs to get to the airport soon. He takes this chance to test his racing skills if they're still there. RV starts off doing great and moves in elegant speed until he gets a terrible flashback of his accident. As such, he learns that he could probably never race again because of his fear. In the meantime, Champ gets a piece of glass inside his stomach from eating something taken from the bin. RV, Shona, and Princess run to the hospital where Princess tells her parents the plan she made, which Champ followed. The doctor tells RV and Shona that they need $65,000. The couple has no idea how they are going to get the money and only have two days to get it. RV decides to enter a race for his son's sake. Harry learns about Champ's condition and reconciles with RV and together they set up their own team with new members, which Harry had decided not to do earlier, the reason being his necessity of his job due to his obligations and the money he has to send to his parents and sisters. RV meets Rusty and he starts remembering the horrific accident, but that doesn't stop him from the love of his son. He wins the most tensed race ever in his career, while apparently killing Rusty by crashing his car during the race in the same way as he did by pushing him off the track. In the end, the family is living a happy and fun life, portraying the moral that fear of losing someone you love overcomes your fears. ==Cast== * Saif Ali Khan as Rajveer Singh (RV), a racer, Radhika's husband and Princess' and Champ's father * Rani Mukerji as Radhika Banerjee / Radhika Rajveer Singh \"Shona\", RV's wife and mother of Princess and Champ * Angelina Idnani as Priya Singh \"Princess\", RV and Shona's daughter and Champ's elder sister * Ali Haji as Ranveer Singh \"Champ\", RV and Shona's son and younger brother of Princess * Jaaved Jaaferi as Harry * Bharat Dabholkar as Billy Bhatia * Ravi Khote as Pandya * Sujoy Ghosh as Chatto * Ronobir Leheri as Pindi * Victor Banerjee as Shubho Shekhar Rai Banerjee, Radhika's father * Shruti Seth as Sasha * Dolly Bindra as Mrs. Pandya * Ken Thompson as Rusty == Production == Production began in May 2006 and the film was released on 27 April 2007..
