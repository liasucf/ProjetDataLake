    "text": "{| |} USS Johnston (DD-557) was a World War II-era Fletcher-class destroyer in the service of the United States Navy. She was the first Navy ship named after Lieutenant John V. Johnston. The ship is widely known for her bold action in the Battle off Samar. The small \"tincan\" destroyer, armed with nothing larger than guns and torpedoes, would lead the attack of a handful of light ships which had inadvertently been left unprotected in the path of a massive Japanese fleet led by battleships and cruisers. The actions of Johnston and her little escort carrier task unit \"Taffy 3\" helped stop Admiral Kurita's Center Force from attacking vulnerable U.S. landing forces, and eventually inflicted greater losses to the Japanese attackers than they suffered. ==Construction and commissioning== Johnston was laid down on 6 May 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 25 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie S. Klinger, great-niece of her namesake, and was commissioned on 27 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Ernest E. Evans in command. The day Johnston was commissioned, Cmdr. Evans made a speech to the crew, quoting a phrase attributed to John Paul Jones: \"This is going to be a fighting ship. I intend to go in harm's way, and anyone who doesn't want to go along had better get off right now.\" ==World War II service== During the Marshall Islands campaign, Johnston bombarded the beaches at Kwajalein on 1 February 1944, and made a five-day bombardment of Eniwetok from 17\u201322 February. She gave direct support to invasion troops there, destroying several pillboxes and taking revetments along the beach under fire. ===Sinking of I-176=== En route to patrol duty in the Solomons on 28 March, she bombarded Kapingamarangi Atoll in the Carolines. Johnston shelled an observation tower and several blockhouses, pillboxes, and dugouts along the beach. Two days later, she came into the mouth of the Maririca River, southeast of Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville, Solomon Islands. After laying a heavy barrage into that area, she took up anti-submarine patrol off Bougainville. While performing this duty, on 15 May she sank the Japanese submarine using depth charges. ===Battle of Guam=== After three months of patrol in the Solomons, Johnston sailed to the Marshall Islands to prepare for the invasion and capture of Guam in the Marianas. On 21 July, she teamed up with the Pearl Harbor \"ghost\"\u2014the battleship \u2014to bombard Guam. The destroyer had sent in more than 4,000 rounds of shells by 29 July. Her accurate gunfire shattered the enemy's battery installations and numerous pillboxes and buildings. Johnston next helped protect escort carriers providing air support for the invasion and capture of Peleliu. ===Invasion of the Philippines=== The time had come for General Douglas MacArthur's long-awaited return to the Philippines. Following replenishment at Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, she sailed on 12 October to help protect the escort carriers maintaining air supremacy over eastern Leyte and the Gulf, sweeping the enemy off local airfields, giving troops direct support on the landing beaches from 20 October, and even destroying vehicle transport and supply convoys on the roads of Leyte itself. Johnston was operating with \"Taffy 3\" (Escort Carrier Task Unit 77.4.3) comprising Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. \u201cZiggy\u201d Sprague's flagship , five other escort carriers, three destroyers including herself, and four destroyer escorts. \"Taffy 3\" was one of the three units of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Escort Carrier Task Group 77.4, known by their voice calls as \"Taffy 1\", \"Taffy 2\", and \"Taffy 3\". ===Engagement of Taffy 3=== On the morning of 23 October 1944, American submarines detected and attacked units of the Japanese fleet coming in from the South China Sea toward the precarious Leyte beachhead. The battleship- cruiser-destroyer Southern Force was decimated as it attempted to enter Leyte Gulf via Surigao Strait the night of 24\u201325 October. The more powerful battleship-cruiser-destroyer Center Force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita had been pounded by Admiral William \u201cBull\u201d Halsey's attack carrier planes and presumably turned back from San Bernardino Strait. Admiral Halsey then raced north with his attack carriers and heavy battleships to engage a decoy Japanese carrier\u2013battleship task force off Cape Engano. This left Johnston and her small escort carrier task unit as lonely sentinels in north Leyte Gulf, east of Samar and off San Bernardino Strait. As enemy ships fled the Battle of Surigao Strait at daybreak of 25 October, the powerful Japanese Center Force slipped through San Bernardino Strait and into the Philippine Sea heading toward Leyte Gulf. It steamed along the coast of Samar directly for Johnstons little task unit and the American invasion beachhead at Leyte, hoping to destroy amphibious shipping and American troops on shore. One of the pilots flying patrol after dawn alert that morning reported the approach of Japanese Center Force. Steaming straight for \"Taffy 3\" were four battleships (including the ), eight cruisers (two light and six heavy), and eleven destroyers. Lieutenant Robert C. Hagen, Johnstons gunnery officer, later reported, \"We felt like little David without a slingshot.\" In less than a minute, Johnston was zigzagging between the six escort carriers and the Japanese fleet and putting out a smoke screen over a front to conceal the carriers from the enemy gunners: \"Even as we began laying smoke, the Japanese started lobbing shells at us and Johnston had to zigzag between the splashes.... We were the first destroyer to make smoke, the first to start firing, the first to launch a torpedo attack....\" For the first 20 minutes, Johnston could not return fire as the enemy cruisers and battleships' heavy guns outranged Johnstons guns. Not waiting for orders, Commander Evans broke formation and went on the offensive by ordering Johnston to speed directly toward the enemy\u2014first a line of seven destroyers, next one light and three heavy cruisers, then the four battleships. To the east appeared three other cruisers and several destroyers. As soon as range closed to within ten miles, Johnston fired on the heavy cruiser \u2014the nearest ship\u2014and scored several damaging hits. During her five- minute sprint into torpedo range, Johnston fired over 200 rounds at the enemy, then under the direction of torpedo officer Lieutenant Jack K. Bechdel, made her torpedo attack. She got off all 10 torpedoes, and turned to retire behind a heavy smoke screen. When she came out of the smoke a minute later, the Kumano could be seen burning furiously from a torpedo hit. Her bow had been blown completely off, and she was forced to withdraw. Around this time, Johnston took three shell hits from , followed closely by three shells\u2014either from a light cruiser or Yamato\u2014which hit the bridge. The shells resulted in the loss of all power to the steering engine and all power to the three guns in the aft of the ship, and rendered the gyrocompass useless. A low-lying squall came up, and Johnston \"ducked into it\" for a few minutes of rapid repairs and salvage work. The bridge was abandoned and Commander Evans, who had lost two fingers on his left hand, went to the aft steering column to conn the ship. At 07:50, Admiral Sprague ordered destroyers to make a torpedo attack: \"small boys attack\". Johnston, unable to keep position with her damaged engine, and with her torpedoes already expended, nonetheless moved to provide fire support for the other destroyers. As she emerged from a smoke screen, she nearly collided with the destroyer . At 08:20, Johnston sighted a Kong\u014d-class battleship\u2014only away\u2014emerging through the smoke. The destroyer opened fire, scoring multiple hits on the superstructure of the much larger ship. The return fire from the battleship missed clearly. Johnston soon observed under fire from an enemy cruiser, and engaged the cruiser in an effort to draw her fire away from the carrier. Johnston scored four hits on the heavy cruiser, then broke off as the Japanese destroyer squadron was seen closing rapidly on the American escort carriers. The Johnston engaged the lead ship until it quit, then the second until the remaining enemy units broke off to get out of effective gun range before launching torpedoes, all of which missed. Then, Johnstons luck ran out; she came under heavy fire from multiple enemy ships, and right when it was most needed, the damaged remaining engine quit, leaving her dead in the water. Some time into the battle, a Japanese battleship, Kong\u014d, fired two rounds from her main cannons. One round punched through the thin side armor of Johnston and cut a hole through the engine room. Her speed was cut in half. The enemy ships closed in for an easy kill, pouring fire into the crippled destroyer. Johnston took a hit that knocked out one forward gun and damaged another, and her bridge was rendered untenable by fires and explosions resulting from a hit in her ready ammunition locker. Evans, who had shifted his command to Johnstons fantail, was yelling orders through an open hatch to men turning her rudder by hand. At one of her batteries, a crewman kept calling \"More shells! More shells!\" Still the destroyer battled to keep the Japanese destroyers and cruisers from reaching the five surviving American carriers. \"We were now in a position where all the gallantry and guts in the world couldn't save us, but we figured that help for the carrier must be on the way, and every minute's delay might count.... By 9:30 we were going dead in the water; even the Japanese couldn't miss us. They made a sort of running semicircle around our ship, shooting at us like a bunch of Indians attacking a prairie schooner. Our lone engine and fire room was knocked out; we lost all power, and even the indomitable skipper knew we were finished. At 9:45 he gave the saddest order a captain can give: 'Abandon Ship.'... At 10:10 Johnston rolled over and began to sink. The Japanese destroyer came up to and pumped a final shot into her to make sure she went down. A survivor saw the Japanese captain salute her as she went down, considering her an honorable enemy. That was the end of Johnston. Crewmen from the destroyer escort spotted Evans at the fantail, asking \"isn't that their captain\", waving to them with what they did not realize was his only good hand. From Johnstons complement of 327 officers and men, only 141 were saved. Of the 186 men lost, about 50 were killed by enemy action, 45 died later on rafts from wounds, and 92 men\u2014including Cmdr. Evans\u2014got off before she sank, but were never seen again. ===Aftermath=== and also sacrificed themselves to save the escort carriers and to protect the landings at Leyte. Two of four Japanese heavy cruisers were sunk by combined surface and air attacks, and Admiral Sprague was soon amazed by the sight of the retirement of Kurita's entire fleet. By this time, planes of \"Taffy 2\" and \"Taffy 1\" and every available unit of the Fleet were headed to assist \"Taffy 3\". But Johnston and her little escort carrier task unit had stopped Admiral Kurita's powerful Center Force in the Battle off Samar, inflicting greater losses than they suffered. ==Awards== Johnstons supreme courage and daring in the Battle off Samar won her the Presidential Unit Citation as a unit of \"Taffy 3\" (Task Unit 77.4.3). Lt. Cmdr. Ernest E. Evans was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor: \"The skipper was a fighting man from the soles of his broad feet to the ends of his straight black hair. He was an Oklahoman and proud of the Indian blood he had in him. We called him\u2014though not to his face\u2014the Chief. The Johnston was a fighting ship, but he was the heart and soul of her.\" In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, Johnston received six battle stars for service in World War II. ==Legacy== , was a Dealey-class destroyer escort named for Ernest E. Evans. She was launched in 1955 and stricken in 1973. No current ship carries the name of Evans, but there was a . In contrast, three current ships\u2014, , and , all guided missile frigates\u2014were named for Samuel B. Roberts and members of her crew. The second Johnston was launched on 10 October 1945. On 27 February 1981, Johnston was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred to the Republic of China (Taiwan). She served in the Republic of China Navy as the ROCS Chen Yang, and was later reclassified a guided missile destroyer, the DDG-928. Chen Yang was decommissioned on 16 December 2003. ==Wreck location== On 30 October 2019 it was announced that the research vessel of Vulcan Inc discovered what is believed to be the deepest shipwreck ever located at deep in the Philippine Trench; the wreck is in pieces with no significant hull sections located. The wreckage pieces found consist of two destroyed 5-inch turrets, a propeller shaft and propeller, two funnels, a mast, a barbette, and unidentified piles of twisted hull, interior, or machinery debris. A track mark in the mud was found leading deeper into the trench, possibly suggesting the main wreck slid deeper still after impacting onto the seabed. However, as the ROV was already at its operational limits, it was decided not to investigate further at the time. The crew believe that the wreck is Johnston based on the visible paint scheme on the turrets, but this is currently unconfirmed. == References == == Further reading == * * ==External links== * WW2DB: Johnston * NavSource.org - DD-557 * Dead in the Water by Evan Thomas * The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors by James D.
