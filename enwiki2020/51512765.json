    "text": "Hudson College is a co-educational, non-denominational private school for students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12. It is situated on a 4.5-acre campus in the former Earlscourt Junior Public School in central Toronto, Ontario. == History == Hudson College was established in early 2003. One of the school's founders, Jack Bavington, serves as the principal of the High School (Upper School). Prior to his current role, Jack worked as a principal at a large collegiate institute in Scarborough. His son, Jeff Bavington, and also one of the school's founders, serves as the principal of the Elementary School (Lower School). The school is housed in the former Earlscourt Junior Public School and leased from the Toronto District School Board, which also leases part of the building to the Toronto Catholic District School Board for Stella Maris Catholic School. == Programs == Hudson College is a fully accredited school recognized by the Ontario Ministry of Education. The education curriculum offers courses from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12, pre- university programs. === Kindergarten === The Junior and Senior Kindergarten full-day programs are inspired by the methodologies of the Reggio Emilia teaching philosophy. This pedagogy encourages children to explore, investigate, and grow. The Reggio Emilia approach to teaching originated in Northern Italy and is founded on the belief that children's curiosity about their world, as well as their innate sense of creativity, should guide their learning. === Lower school === At the lower school level, students are engaged in a rigorous academic program of Mathematics, The Arts, and Sciences over a recurring eight-day schedule. Elementary-aged students may participate in many different extra-curricular clubs and activities throughout the course of a school year. In addition, students from JK to Grade Four participate in two co-curricular programs within the school year - an instructional skating program followed by an instructional swimming program. Students may receive their level certifications through the official CanSkate and Ultra Swim accreditation programs respectively. The school\u2019s Middle School Preparatory Program (Grades 6-8) has been integrated within the overall academic program. The goal is to teach students executive functioning skills such as time management, organization, study habits, critical thinking, and test taking skills that students will need as they enter High School. The school also offers a variety of outdoor education programmes and excursions within the city and province for its Elementary students. === Upper school === At the Upper School level, Hudson College adopts the standard Ontario curriculum to prepare students for university placement. They will receive the Ontario Secondary School Diploma upon completing their full range of school credits. A wide range of courses is available for selection, including AP courses in senior-level Mathematics, Science, Business and English. Students follow a flexible three-semester curriculum starting in Grade 9. The Fall semester begins in September and ends in December, where students enroll in up to four courses. The Winter semester begins during January and ends within April, where students again may enroll in up to four courses. The Spring semester takes place between May and June, where students may enroll in up to two courses. Beginning in grade 8, all students and staff are part of a House System, with each House representing a major geographical area of Canada. The Houses include The Maritimes (Crimson Red), The Great Lakes (Royal Blue), The Prairies (Kelly Green), and The Rockies (Purple). Each House competes for the year-end awarding of the Discovery Trophy. The High School offers a variety of clubs and activities as well as excursions within the province and abroad. High School students may also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh program. == Athletics == Sporting amenities at Hudson College include a modern gymnasium and outdoor recreational facilities, with a multi-sport turf field and running track. The school\u2019s sports teams are known as the Hudson Huskies. Hudson College is part of the Small Schools Athletic Federation (SSAF). The SSAF calendar is divided into three athletic sessions \u2013 Fall, Winter, and Spring \u2013 with opportunities in either individual and/or team sports in each session. Hudson has won 16 banners in various SSAF sports. The school participates in 18 individual and team sports each year. Hudson\u2019s uniform colours are navy blue, royal blue, and gold. == References == == External links == * Hudson College official website Category:Private schools in Toronto Category:High schools in Toronto Category:Elementary schools in Toronto Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 Category:Education in Toronto ",
