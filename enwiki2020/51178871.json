The British Rail Mark 5 is the designation given to locomotive-hauled rail carriages built by Spanish manufacturer CAF for operation with Caledonian Sleeper. ==Description== In 2015, the Caledonian Sleeper service, which had formed part of the ScotRail franchise, was split into a separate operation, with Serco as the new franchise operator. As part of the franchise agreement, Serco was committed to procuring new rolling stock to replace the operation's existing fleet of Mark 2 and Mark 3 passenger coaches. In February 2015, Serco signed a \u20ac200m deal with CAF to purchase 75 coaches of five different types. These will be formed into a total of four 16-coach trains (London Euston to Fort William, Inverness and Aberdeen, London Euston to Edinburgh and Glasgow, plus the two respective return services), plus two coaches for Fort Willam-Edinburgh-Fort William, with nine coaches as spares, and will be hauled by locomotives between London and Glasgow/Edinburgh, and s on unelectrified routes. The new vehicles will be the first new locomotive-hauled passenger coaches introduced onto the British network since the Mark 4 vehicles on the East Coast Main Line as part of the InterCity 225 sets in 1989-1992. The first five cars began testing on the Velim railway test circuit in the Czech Republic in August 2017, before being delivered to Polmadie TRSMD in January 2018. Mark 5s commenced operating the London to Edinburgh and Glasgow services in April 2019, with the remainder converted in October 2019.New \u00a3150m Caledonian Sleeper train arrives three hours late BBC News 29 April 2019Caledonian Sleeper launches new CAF coaches Railway Gazette International 29 April 2019 ==Specifications== In accordance with the Scottish Government Caledonian Sleeper franchise agreement, Serco's order for purpose-built sleeper rolling stock from CAF originally specified six different types of vehicles to accommodate onboard services and accommodation types.
