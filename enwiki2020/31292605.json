She joined TVB in 2009 and left in 2015 to explore a career in China. ==Life & Career== ===Early Days=== Oc\u00e9ane was born and raised in Beijing. Growing up, she had been interested in the performing arts and longed to study it in France. Both her parents are in the Chinese Army and at seventeen, her parents gave her the option of either joining the military or study abroad; she chose to pursue her dreams. She eventually moved to Paris and studied acting at Cours Florent (a private French drama school) to hone her craft and graduated in 2010, making her fluent in Mandarin and French. https://www.scmp.com/article/691595/qa-oceane- zhu-xuan ===2008 Miss China Europe & Miss China International=== While studying in Paris, she was a part-time model and learned about the Miss China Europe 2008 pageant when a reporter asked her about it. Feeling she had nothing to lose, she attended and won the competition. Afterwards, she represented Paris in the Miss China International 2008 pageant in Hong Kong and also won. Like all beauty pageant winners in HK, Oc\u00e9ane was offered a contract to act in TVB and began her acting career. ===Joining TVB & 2009 Debut=== While Oc\u00e9ane joined TVB in 2009, she wouldn't make an official appearance in HK until 2010 in the drama Some Day. Usually the pageant winner is untrained in acting and go through acting school before making their debut, Oc\u00e9ane was already trained and still went through the acting courses to refine her acting and speak Cantonese. However, she made her acting debut in the 2009 Taiwanese historical drama (later remade into a movie): the Prince of Tears. Oc\u00e9ane would work in TVB for the next seven years. During her time with TVB though, Oc\u00e9ane never had lead roles and only played support roles due to her limited fluency in Cantonese. ===2015 TVB Departure & 2018 Marriage=== By around October 2015, Oc\u00e9ane declared she's leaving TVB. Her contract was expiring and she decided not to renew; she decided to explore her career within China. https://sg.news.yahoo.com/oceane-zhu-confirms-departure- tvb-065300454.html She would venture into film, featured in 2016's Line Walker and 2017's The Bittersweet.
