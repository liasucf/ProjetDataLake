Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade received his first education from his father and uncle Kemaleddin Kas\u0131m, in Ankara and Bursa, and completed his studies in Istanbul. He was appointed to Oru\u00e7 Pasha Madrasah in Dimetoka in 1525, and then to Hac\u0131 H\u00fcseyinzade Madrasah in Istanbul. Later, he worked as a professor in various madrasas in Skopje and Edirne. He was appointed qadi (judge) of Bursa in 1545, and of \u0130stanbul in 1551. A sight problem led to an early retirement from public service in 1554, but he continued working on the publication of his writings. ==Works== *Shaq\u0101\u02beiq al-Nu\u02bfm\u0101niyya f\u012b \u02bfUlem\u0101\u02beal- Dawla al-\u02bfUthm\u0101niyya () 'Anemones of the Ottoman Era': (Arabic); biographical encyclopedia on the works of 552 scholars and sheikhs from the first Ottoman ruler Osman I to Suleyman I (Suleiman the Magnificent), and is the primary source for the lives of scholars and scientists under the reign of Mehmed the Conqueror. *\u015eaka'ik\u00fc'n-Nu'maniye fi-Ulemai'd-Devlet\u00fc'l-Osmaniye (Turkish ed.), or \u015eakaik-\u0131 Nu'maniye ve zeyilleri (Turkish ed.). * Mift\u0101\u1e25 al-Sa\u02bf\u0101da wa-mi\u1e63b\u0101\u1e25 al-Siy\u0101dah () \u2013 'Key to Happiness and Lamp of Lordship'; encyclopedia in Arabic.
