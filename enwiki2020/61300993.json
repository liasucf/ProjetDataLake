Currently it is formed by Bruno Faglioni (vocals), Eduardo Faro (guitar), Rog\u00e9rio Feltrin (bass) and Wellington Greve (drums). In a short time Rosa de Saron began to compose his own songs and to participate in festivals, always guaranteeing the first placements, taking the band to be known in the musical scene of Campinas and then to record his first album: Diante da Cruz. The second album, Ang\u00fastia Suprema (1997), arouses interest outside the religious milieu and is highly praised by specialized magazines. In 1999, the band recorded Olhando de Frente. In 2002, after the exchange of vocalist (Marcelo Machado by the then new vocal Guilherme de S\u00e1), due to the former vocalist claim not to be able to reconcile his other project with the band, Rosa de Saron launches Depois do Inverno, which shows the whole phase of renewal that the band was passing, already with Guilherme de S\u00e1 assuming the vocals, after having recorded a tape with his test. The record enshrines the band in the music scene. In 2005, he released Casa dos Espelhos and in 2007, the band recorded the Acoustic CD, where he recorded several of his acoustic hits, including the unreleased song \"Monte Inverno\". In April 2008, to celebrate 20 years of career, they recorded the first DVD, and from that, the sixth CD, titled Ac\u00fastico and ao Vivo. the CD / DVD is released by Codimuc and later released to re-release along with Som Livre in January 2009. It was also re-released in 2013, this time with Universal Music. The disc was certified with Gold Disc and later, Platinum Disc. After the notoriety with the acoustic format, they return to the electric format releasing the album Horizonte Distant, that granted the band a new Gold Record. In September 2010, the band recorded in S\u00e3o Paulo, its second live DVD, and coming from this the eighth CD, titled Horizonte Vivo Distante, with the participation of the singer Maur\u00edcio Manieri in the song \"Rara Calma\", which was nominated for a Latin Grammy and once again awarded the band the Golden Record. Then they released an EP titled Siete Cami\u00f1os, with songs re-recorded in other languages, taking advantage of the opportunity that the band had to present at World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid. In 2012, backing to the studios, the band launches the CD O Agora e O Eterno, with 17 unpublished songs, which reaffirmed the vocation of good acceptance of the band in all means, religious or not, once again obtaining Gold Album by job. In 2013, they recorded the tenth CD and third live DVD of their career, titled Latitude, Longitude, recorded at Chevrolet Hall in Belo Horizonte, once again among the best sellers in the country. This work counted with the participation of Mauro Henrique from the band G3, Renato Vianna and Jonny Voice. In 2014, the album Cartas ao Remetente was released. In 2015, they recorded the twelfth CD and 4th live DVD of their career, titled Ac\u00fastico and Vivo 2/3, which brought the band back to acoustic format.

In 2018, the band released the album Gran Paradiso. On 13 November 2018, Guilherme de S\u00e1 announced his dismissal of Rosa de Saron, through video on the band's Facebook page. At midnight on 8 March 2019 the band released the clip of the song A F\u00eanix, which announced the arrival of vocalist Bruno Faglioni to the band. == History == ===1988\u20131999: The early years === In the late 1980s, the group initially played during Masses and at the youth group in the Catholic Community of Infant Jesus of Prague, in the Cambui neighborhood of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo. In the mid-1990s, members of the Rosa de Saron band decided to use heavy rock to evangelize and to some extent leverage the Catholic rock circuit. In this phase the band was formed by Marcelo \"Tchel\u00e3o\" Machado (vocal), Alessandro (drums), Eduardo \"Duzinho\" Faro (guitar), Alex Nozaki Mota (guitar), Rog\u00e9rio \"Cazuza\" Feltrin (bass) and Eduardo Bortolato). In 1994 the first album, Diante da Cruz, was released. The disc became a reference in the religious medium, for containing an unprecedented sound in its segment, mixing hard rock with heavy metal. It was released independently on vinyl and cassette in 1995. In 1996, with the founding of Codimuc, the work was re- released. After the release of the work, Alex Nozaki left the band, and Welington Greve (Grev\u00e3o) takes the drums instead of Alessandro. In 1997 the band released the album Supreme Ang\u00fastia, which was produced by Daniel Stiling. In 1998, the group completed its 10 years of existence, and in the same year a show took place in the Parque do Taquaral, in Campinas, where the first Catholic rock festival in history was held. As of 1999, the band started to admit other aspects of rock, and in the same period the band released the first Catholic single, Olhando de Frente, which had a pre-release on a band show at Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova, in Cachoeira Paulista, on 25 June 1999. Shortly thereafter Marcelo Machado leaves Rosa de Saron to continue his work with The Flanders, claiming that it is difficult to reconcile the two bands. To replace Tchel\u00e3o, they selected Guilherme de S\u00e1 in 2001, and released in 2002 the album Depois do Inverno, which marked a new phase in the band's career, with the highlight of the hit \"Do Alto da Pedra\". On 20 April 2005, at Credicard Hall, the band participated in a DVD in celebration of 15 years of the record label Codimuc with 3 songs: \"Do Alto da Pedra\", \"Sangria\" and \"Muitos Choram\". In \"Sangria\", there was the participation of Marcelo Machado (the former vocalist).

The most well-known explanation is that it represents the four members around the Eucharist (in the center) with the symmetry of a cross. But in an interview the own creator of the logo states: \"It represents a stylized rose, seen from above. The four petals represent the four members of the Band that unite in a single head (same goal), and this object is finished with the general image inspired by the Cross of St. Benedict. Thus, this would be the true meaning\". == Members == === Current training === * Bruno Faglioni \u2013 Vocals (2019\u2013present) * Eduardo Faro \u2013 Guitar (1990\u2013present) * Rog\u00e9rio \"Ler\u00e3o\" Feltrin \u2013 Bass(1988\u2013present) * Wellington \"Grev\u00e3o\" Greve \u2013 Drums (1995\u2013present) === Support Musicians === * Adriano Mota \u2013 Guitar (2011\u2013present) === Former members === * Marcelo \"Tchel\u00e3o\" Machado \u2013 vocal (1988\u20132000) * Alessandro \"Sand\u00e3o\" \u2013 battery (1988\u20131995) * Alex Nozaki \u2013 guitar (1990\u20131995) * Eduardo Bortolatto \u2013 keyboard (1990\u20131998) * Paulo Faganello \u2013 keyboard (2002) * Guilherme de S\u00e1 \u2013 vocal (2001\u20132019) * Marcus Paulo \u2013 Keyboard and Backing Vocal (2014\u20132019) * F\u00e1bio Corr\u00eaa \u2013 Keyboard (2016) * Gustavo Leite \u2013 keyboard (2008\u20132012) * Eduardo Veloso \"Du Bboy\" \u2013 DJ, VJ and Backing vocal (2009\u20132015) == Discography == === Studio albums === *1994: Diante da Cruz *1997: Ang\u00fastia Suprema *2002: Depois do Inverno *2005: Casa dos Espelhos *2007: Ac\u00fastico *2009: Horizonte Distante *2012: O Agora e o Eterno *2014: Cartas ao Remetente *2018: Gran Paradiso === Live albums === *2008: Ac\u00fastico e ao Vivo *2010: Horizonte Vivo Distante *2013: Latitude, Longitude *2015: Ac\u00fastico e ao Vivo 2/3 === EPs === *1999: Olhando de Frente *2011: Siete Cami\u00f1os === Collection === * 2016: Essencial === Singles === * 2013: Aurora (Participation: Renato Vianna, Jhonny Voice) * 2018: Invisibili Orme (Participation: Sister Cristina) * 2019: A F\u00eanix * 2019: Um Dia * 2019: Esperando na Janela (Cogumelo Plut\u00e3o Cover) * 2019: Somos (Participation: Thiago Brado) == Videography == === Live DVDs === * 2008: Ac\u00fastico e Ao Vivo * 2010: Horizonte Vivo Distante * 2013: Latitude, Longitude * 2015: Ac\u00fastico e Ao Vivo 2/3 === Collectings in DVD === * 2016: Essencial === Documentary DVDs === * 2011: Rosa na Estrada == Books == * 2008 \u2013 Rock, Faith and Poetry \u2013 20 years of Rosa de Saron narrated through their music.
