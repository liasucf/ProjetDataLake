A single-tiered fountain made of black iron with a bowl about nine feet in diameter is installed at its center. Polonia Triangle derives its name from the Polish word Polonia, which means 'Polish diaspora'. Polonia Triangle was considered to be the center of Chicago's Polish Downtown, the city's oldest and most prominent Polish settlement. In many ways it functioned as the capital of the American Polonia with the headquarters for almost every major Polish organization in the United States clustered within its vicinity. It is bound by Division, Ashland and Milwaukee Avenue. Organisations located within its vicinity include the Polish National Alliance to the Polish Daily News.Granacki, Victoria: Chicago's Polish Downtown, Arcadia Press, 2004, p. 6-7 Polonia Triangle is one of 11 neighborhoods included in The Labor Trail which chronicles Chicago's history of working class life and struggle.The Labor Trail The site is still home to the Chopin Theatre and is used for processions during Corpus Christi by parishioners of two of Chicago's Polish Cathedrals: St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity Polish Mission. The Blue Line's Division/Milwaukee station is also located at the Polonia Triangle. ==Controversies== There have been two major controversies relating to Polonia Triangle.
