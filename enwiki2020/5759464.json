    "text": "Bo\u017eidar \"Bo\u017ea\" Maljkovi\u0107 (; born 20 April 1952) is a Serbian former professional basketball coach and current president of the Olympic Committee of Serbia. He is one of the most successful basketball coaches in Europe, having won league titles with practically all the clubs he trained; including four EuroLeague titles with three clubs (Jugoplastika, Limoges, and Panathinaikos). In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. His daughter Marina is a Serbian professional basketball coach, currently coaching Serbia women's national team. ==Early life== Born in Oto\u010dac within the region of Lika to Serb parents hailing from villages in the vicinity of nearby Brinje, eight-year-old Maljkovi\u0107's parents moved the family to Kraljevo due to his Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer father getting reassigned there. Maljkovi\u0107 was an avid cyclist in his youth;Interview: Bo\u017ea Maljkovi\u0107;Playboy, April 2011 he took up basketball at the age of 12, playing the shooting guard position at KK Sloga. Assessing his own playing skills, Maljkovi\u0107 later said: \"I had a decent shot, but no defensive skills. As a coach I would never pick Maljkovi\u0107 the player in any serious team\".Maljkovi\u0107 o nema\u0161tini, k\u0107erci, Kuko\u010du, devojkama... ;Politika, October 2009 A few years later, in the mid-1960s, the family moved to Belgrade, settling in an apartment in the newly built \"\u0160est kaplara\" housing development for the JNA officers' families, located in New Belgrade's Blok 21 adjacent to the U\u0161\u0107e neighbourhood. During his time in \"\u0160est kaplara\", teenage Maljkovi\u0107 was neighbours with water polo players Mirko Sandi\u0107 and Zoran Jankovi\u0107 who were prominent VK Partizan and Yugoslav national team members at the time. ==Coaching career== Having ended his playing career prematurely at only 19 years of age, Maljkovi\u0107 immediately began coaching at U\u0161\u0107e, newly established basketball outfit from the eponymous Belgrade neighbourhood. Maljkovi\u0107 is among the four people who founded the fledgling club in 1971 on the initiative of local communist authorities from the New Belgrade municipality. Reportedly, the catalyst to set up a new, community-based basketball activity was a gruesome murder in the U\u0161\u0107e neighbourhood that saw a local resident murder his own son; the shock throughout the community prompted the local authorities into establishing a basketball club in order to provide the neighbourhood youngsters with a creative outlet. The murder came on the heels of a general increase in criminality in the 12,000-resident U\u0161\u0107e local community that mostly consisted of recently arrived families of the Yugoslav People's Army officers and personnel from all over SFR Yugoslavia; this local spike in crime only sped up the process of establishing a basketball club as means of channeling the energy of the local youth into something positive. Maljkovi\u0107, himself a young man, began coaching the club in 1971. In parallel to coaching basketball, Maljkovi\u0107 enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law though he never graduated. Working in extremely modest circumstances without regular access to a gym and with mostly outdoor practices in U\u0161\u0107e park, the club still managed to gain multiple promotions and jump several ranks of competition. In 1977, Maljkovi\u0107 took a coaching offer from the Crvena zvezda youth system, becoming head coach of the club's junior team. ===Radni\u010dki Belgrade=== In 1979, noticing Maljkovi\u0107's dedication and enthusiasm both at U\u0161\u0107e and Red Star, established head coach Bata \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 invited the 27-year- old across town to be his assistant at Radni\u010dki Belgrade, another Belgrade club that much like KK U\u0161\u0107e started out as a community-based operation in the city neighbourhood of Crveni Krst. Seeing Radni\u010dki had been playing in the First Federal League (top tier on the Yugoslav basketball pyramid), Maljkovi\u0107 jumped at the opportunity. The club was also only six years removed from its biggest success \u2014 1973 national league title. In the years following their domestic title, they additionally put together memorable European campaigns, reaching the 1973\u201374 FIBA European Champions Cup semifinal as well as 1976\u201377 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup final. Despite being in constant shadow of the city giants Crvena zvezda and Partizan, Radni\u010dki nevertheless managed to carve out a place for itself on the Yugoslav basketball map, establishing an identity of a scrappy small club regularly punching above its weight. ====1979\u201380 season: assistant to Bata \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107==== In Maljkovi\u0107's first season at Radni\u010dki as \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's assistant, the club finished with a 9\u201313 record, placing 10th in the 12-team league thus barely avoiding relegation. It also experienced major budgetary problems with its main financial backers, state- owned iron foundry factory Fabrika odlivaka Beograd (FOB), cutting their sponsorship. At one point Maljkovi\u0107, who temporarily quit his law studies, said he did not receive a salary for five months.Maljkovi\u0107 interview;RTS, January 2013 ====1980\u201381 season: first top-level head coaching experience==== Continual financial struggles at the club affected it in various ways, including the departure of head coach \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 during summer 1980. Young Maljkovi\u0107 became his replacement, admitting to getting the position \"not because I was somehow the best fit to lead this particular team, but simply because nobody else wanted the job\".;RTS, January 2013 Playing their home games at Hala sportova, 28-year-old Maljkovi\u0107's debut season as head coach in the First League brought no improvement for the club that finished with identical 9\u201313 record, good for 9th place this time. Maljkovi\u0107's Radni\u010dki, however, directly influenced the title race by beating Cibona late in the season (handing Cibona only its third loss that season) thus enabling their Hala co-tenants Partizan to take the championship by catching up to Cibona's 19\u20133 record and overtaking it at the top of the table due to better head-to- head record (this was before the playoff system was introduced in the league). ====1981\u201382 season==== Maljkovi\u0107 stayed for the 1981\u201382 season as well, leading Radni\u010dki one more time to its now customary 9\u201313 record. At the end of the season, the club saw another big exodus of its players and staff, including Maljkovi\u0107, due to more sponsors backing out. Summing up his time with Radni\u010dki, in 2013 Maljkovi\u0107 expressed \"certain sadness all these years later due to feeling I could've done more with that team, something like what I managed with Jugoplastika later, but on a smaller scale, because we had a very talented group of young players along with some older ones\".Maljkovi\u0107 interview;RTS, January 2013 ===Six months in Stara Pazova=== After Radni\u010dki, during summer 1982 Maljkovi\u0107 took a head coaching offer from KK Lifam, a club from Stara Pazova playing in the Yugoslav First B League, the country's second-tier competition. He remained living in Belgrade and would drive out to Stara Pazova every morning for practices. ===Ranko \u017deravica's assistant at Crvena zvezda=== With a bit of a coaching CV now behind him, Maljkovi\u0107 was approached in early 1983 by Crvena zvezda about joining their coaching staff as assistant to legendary coach Ranko \u017deravica in addition to an offer of simultaneously leading the club's youth system. He took the job largely due to \u017deravica's clout and authority in Yugoslav basketball despite advice from some colleagues who felt that taking an assistant job after being a head coach in the First League was a step backward career-wise. ===Jugoplastika=== Maljkovi\u0107's big head coaching break would come at Jugoplastika, where he arrived in early summer 1986 on recommendation from Yugoslav basketball's universally revered elder statesman Aca Nikoli\u0107 who, having just recently retired from active coaching, took on an advisory role with the Split club. The young assistant coach was not the club's first choice as they initially wanted Vlade \u0110urovi\u0107,;TVBN, May 2013 the hottest coaching commodity in Yugoslav basketball at the time having just led Zadar to the league championship. In demand \u0110urovi\u0107, however, turned down the head coaching offer from Split, choosing the one from Crvena zvezda instead so after unsuccessfully courting a few more candidates Jugoplastika eventually turned to Maljkovi\u0107 who gladly accepted. The appointment of a young and unproven head coach was not without critics at Split, including some within the club such as 19-year-old center Dino Ra\u0111a who openly talked to the press about his displeasure with the hiring of Maljkovi\u0107 who in the young player's opinion \"lacked head coaching experience\". And it wasn't just Ra\u0111a questioning Maljkovi\u0107's coaching credentials because the quiet consensus around Split at the time was that Jugoplastika is a potent squad loaded with young talent and as such needs an experienced coach to provide leadership, not someone still learning his craft. Jugoplastika ended the just completed 1985\u201386 league season in 6th spot (outside of the top four required to make the playoffs) following a turbulent campaign that started with Slavko Trnini\u0107 as head coach, before he got the sack due to poor results early on and got replaced with Zoran Slavni\u0107. Freewheeling Slavni\u0107 initiated a squad overhaul by bringing younger players into the first team (including great 17-year-old prospect \u2013 small forward Toni Kuko\u010d who was equally adept at playing any other position) and giving them greater freedom on the court. This resulted in Jugoplastika ending the season with a 12\u201310 record that tied it with \u0160ibenka and Partizan, however due to worse head-to-head record against the two teams it ended in 6th spot and out of the playoffs, still good for a Kora\u0107 Cup berth next season. Despite clear improvement since his arrival Slavni\u0107 still left at the end of the season. ====1986\u201387: building a future champion==== The young 34-year-old coach Maljkovi\u0107 thus took over a young squad with supremely talented Kuko\u010d and Ra\u0111a as its biggest assets. Other prominent players on the team included the twenty-year-old shooting guard Velimir Perasovi\u0107 and twenty-two-year-old center Goran Sobin. Several older players such as Ivica Dukan left the club that summer. Maljkovi\u0107's only summer acquisition of note was the twenty-two- year-old point guard Zoran Sretenovi\u0107 from Crvena zvezda where he wasn't getting much of a chance to play as backup to established national team player Zoran Radovi\u0107; Maljkovi\u0107 knew the player and his situation at Red Star well, having spent a year coaching him there. Liking Sretenovi\u0107's character qualities and believing in his basketball skills, Maljkovi\u0107 decided to give him a chance by bringing him in to be the team's primary playmaker, envisioning his role at Jugoplastika as the main distributor on offense for Kuko\u010d and Ra\u0111a. Maljkovi\u0107's decision to get Sretenovi\u0107 was second-guessed among the club's management who simply didn't know the player and were hoping for an established name. Under the tutelage of sixty-two-year-old professor Nikoli\u0107 who had finished his coaching career and now acted as a coaching consultant, Maljkovi\u0107 set about molding the obvious raw basketball talent this young squad possessed. In interviews with the local press, he identified lack of recognizable playing structure as the problem he wants the team to overcome. To that end, in stark contrast to his predecessor Slavni\u0107, Maljkovi\u0107 insisted on strict discipline as well as frequent and exhausting training sessions, believing the sheer quantity of work put in will eventually yield results for Jugoplastika against its formidable Yugoslav League rivals such as reigning European champion Cibona led by 22-year-old Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, reigning league champion Zadar, young and up-and-coming Parizan, and experienced Crvena zvezda. Maljkovi\u0107's first season in charge already provided some encouraging signs as Jugoplastika finished the league regular season with a 15\u20137 record, which was enough for the 3rd spot (behind 22\u20130 Cibona and 18\u20134 Partizan) and a playoff berth. The season in Europe was not as promising. Drawn in a round- robin group with Olympique Antibes, Divarese Varese, and FC Barcelona, Jugoplastika managed only two wins in its six games, finishing last and getting eliminated from the 1986\u201387 FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup at the very first hurdle. Back in the Yugoslav league, in the playoff semifinal best-of-3 series Jugoplastika lost 2\u20131 to Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107-coached Partizan led by youngsters Sa\u0161a \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, Vlade Divac, and \u017darko Paspalj. In many ways the two teams mirrored one another \u2013 they both had young head coaches who both took over their respective teams in the summer of 1986 while both teams also had a variety of young talent on their respective rosters. Maljkovi\u0107 and his Jugoplastika lost this battle to Vujo\u0161evi\u0107's Partizan, but it would prove to be only the first of many in the years to come. ====1987\u201388: Yugoslav League champions==== During the summer 1987 off-season, Maljkovi\u0107 identified a need for more experience on the roster in order to make a deeper playoff run. He thus brought in Du\u0161ko Ivanovi\u0107, experienced small forward from Budu\u0107nost who was about to turn 30. Young Jugoplastika starlets Kuko\u010d and Ra\u0111a were selected by the Yugoslav national team head coach Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 for EuroBasket 1987 where the team took bronze after losing to Greece in the semis. Later that summer the two were picked again for national team duty, this time by the under-19 national team coach Svetislav Pe\u0161i\u0107 for the Under-19 World Cup in Bormio. Yugoslav youth team steamrolled over the competition, including the USA team, with Kuko\u010d dropping 11 three-pointers on them from 12 attempts. Coming back to Split for the club season start in the fall, team leaders Kuko\u010d and Ra\u0111a were brimming with confidence and fitness. Jugoplastika started off the season tremendously, piling up wins in the Yugoslav League. Simultaneously, in Kora\u0107 Cup, they easily made it to the quarterfinal group featuring CAI Zaragoza, Hapoel Tel Aviv, and Arexons Cant\u00f9, but lost all three of its away games for the 3\u20133 group record that wasn't good enough to progress to the semifinals. Back on the domestic league front, Jugosplastika continued its great run to finish the regular season 21\u20131. ====1988\u201389: Euroleague champions, Yugoslav League title repeat==== During summer 1988, Maljkovi\u0107 brought in 20-year-old Luka Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 from Cibona. ====1989\u201390 treble: Euroleague repeat, Yugoslav League three-peat, and Yugoslav Cup==== During the summer 1989 off-season, Maljkovi\u0107 and club general-manager Josip Bili\u0107 faced a crisis over Ra\u0111a's status after the young center got drafted by Boston Celtics in late June. Under contract with Jugoplastika until 1992, the 22-year-old expressed willingness to join Boston right away \"if the financial offer is good\", but the Split club was adamant they would not release him.Coach Denies Yugoslav Will Join Celtics : But Lakers' Pick Will Be Permitted to Play in NBA;Los Angeles Times, 29 June 1989 Maljkovi\u0107 even publicly called on Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than 26 from transferring to NBA teams.Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a...;Los Angeles Times, 30 June 1989 After weeks of wrangling over his status, Ra\u0111a tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by acting unilaterally \u2014 flying over to the U.S. and signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly in the neighbourhood of $500,000. However, seeing the situation as a clear case of contract poaching by Boston and its GM Jan Volk, the Split club wouldn't give up the legal fight. They took the case to US courts that ruled in their favour in late September, prohibiting Ra\u0111a from playing for the CelticsU.S. Court Bars Yugoslav Star From Joining Celtics;Los Angeles Times, 26 September 1989 thus forcing him to work out some kind of an agreement with Jugoplastika. In the middle of the Ra\u0111a saga, not knowing its outcome, Maljkovi\u0107 did some contingency planning by bringing in 22-year-old Zoran Savi\u0107 from \u010celik Zenica who could play both the center and power forward positions. He also brought in point guard Petar Naumoski and power forward Aramis Nagli\u0107. Starting the new season, as the reigning European champion, Maljkovi\u0107's team got invited to participate at the McDonald's Open in Rome in late October 1989. Before the tournament, Maljkovi\u0107 got presented with the European Coach of the Year award. The friendly tournament was also Maljkovi\u0107's first chance to coach against an NBA team as his Jugoplastika put in a great effort against Doug Moe's Denver Nuggets featuring small forward Alex English, guard Fat Lever, and veteran Walter Davis, losing 129\u2013135 in a run-and-gun contest. ===FC Barcelona=== After four spectacular seasons at Split, Maljkovi\u0107 became one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe. He accepted FC Barcelona's offer, taking over in summer 1990. With four consecutive Spanish League titles behind them, Bar\u00e7a were looking for European success that continually eluded it. In fact, it was Maljkovi\u0107's Jugoplastika that knocked Bar\u00e7a consecutively out of two previous Final Fours (1989 semifinal and 1990 final). With Maljkovi\u0107's arrival, the previous head coach A\u00edto Garc\u00eda moved to an administrative role, becoming the club's new general manager. The relationship between new head coach Maljkovi\u0107 and new general manager A\u00edto was fraught from the very beginning. Bar\u00e7a ended up with a fairly thin roster consisting of a few experienced players such as Audie Norris, Picul\u00edn Ortiz, Steve Trumbo, Nacho Soloz\u00e1bal, and Epi as well as a slew of youngsters like Jos\u00e9 Luis Galilea, Roger Esteller, \u00c1ngel Almeida, and Lisard Gonz\u00e1lez, most of them called up from the club's youth system. Maljkovi\u0107 also got a club- assigned assistant Manolo Flores. Maljkovi\u0107's team did well to make the Euroleague final four, however they fell at the very last hurdle, losing to his former team Pop 84. Later that season they failed to win the domestic league as well while Spanish King's Cup came as bit of a consolation. In a 2015 interview, talking about his 1990\u201391 season at Bar\u00e7a, Maljkovi\u0107 discussed the tension within the club's front office: Maljkovi\u0107 started the 1991\u201392 season at Barcelona, but on 22 November 1991, fourteen games into the league season, he decided to resign. ===Limoges CSP=== Maljkovi\u0107 wouldn't be without a head coaching job for long as barely just over a month later in January 1992, he took over Limoges mid-season. Led on the court by 32-year-old veteran Richard Dacoury, the team made the league playoffs final versus Pau-Orthez, but lost the best-of-three series 0\u20132 despite having the home-court advantage. The summer 1992 arrival of thirty-one-year-old veteran Michael Young as well as established Slovenian point guard Jure Zdovc from Knorr Bologna and power forward Jim Bilba set the club on an improbable run. Playing suffocating defense with low-scoring games, Maljkovi\u0107's Limoges ended up winning the French League and the EuroLeague title. Drawn in a tough EuroLeague round robin group with Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107-coached Greek champions PAOK featuring fresh NBA arrival Cliff Levingston as well as holdovers Panagiotis Fasoulas, Ken Barlow, and Bane Prelevi\u0107, Ettore Messina's eager-for-Euro-success Knorr Bologna led by freshly arrived rising star Sa\u0161a Danilovi\u0107, EuroLeague runners- up Joventut Marbella led by the Jofresa brothers (Rafa and Tom\u00e1s) and Jordi Villacampa, Maccabi Electra with veterans Doron Jamchi and David Ancrum, Scavolini Pesaro featuring emerging star Carlton Myers and veteran Walter Magnifico, few gave modest-looking Limoges roster much of a chance. Throughout the season, they produced unbalanced scoring with Young usually getting more than 30 points per game along with a handful of others contributing with less than 5 points. Maljkovi\u0107 received some flak for this playing style; Petar Skansi, the head coach of Benetton Treviso called him out for \"playing anti- basketball\" after their EuroLeague final in April 1993. ===Panathinaikos=== In summer 1995, Maljkovi\u0107 took the offer from Greek giants Panathinaikos, a club bankrolled by the pharmaceutical riches of the Giannakopoulos brothers \u2014 Pavlos and Thanasis \u2014 who invested heavily in search of elusive EuroLeague and domestic league success. The club was coming off yet another season of disappointment as they finished second in the Greek League to bitter rivals Olympiacos, while the EuroLeague Final Four semifinal loss, again to Olympiacos, came as an even more bitter pill. Maljkovi\u0107's work was thus very clearly cut out for him, nothing less than the EuroLeague or Greek League title, preferably both, would do. Taking over for head coach Efthimis Kioumourtzoglou, Maljkovi\u0107 found a squad led by holdovers Panagiotis Giannakis, Kostas Patavoukas, Nikos Oikonomou, Fragiskos Alvertis, Christos Myriounis, Miroslav Pecarski and Stojko Vrankovi\u0107, while the squad leader \u017darko Paspalj left along with coach Kioumourtzoglou, both victims of the trophy-less season. However, the roster was about to get a big boost as the Giannakopoulos brothers managed to bring in 35-year-old NBA legend Dominique Wilkins to Athens, signing him to a two-year contract worth US$7 million. The arrival of Wilkins created a lot of buzz around the club as 5,000 fans greeted him upon landing at the Athens airport in September 1995. The next day some 13,000 fans turned out for his first practice. In the coach's first season at the club, Maljkovi\u0107's Panathinaikos won the EuroLeague title, the club's first in its history. Maljkovi\u0107 coached Panathinaikos in the 1996\u201397 season to an 18\u20138 regular season record, which was enough for the 3rd spot that qualified it for the playoffs. However, as the playoffs were about to start the coach was let go on 13 April 1997 and replaced with Michalis Kyritsis. === Paris and Spain === Maljkovi\u0107 then went to Paris SG, Unicaja, and Real Madrid. After leaving Real Madrid, a lot of speculation appeared about his next coaching job. In an interview with Sportski \u017eurnal, he said that he had been offered the role of head coach of the Lithuanian League club \u017dalgiris, but that he would only take the job in the summer, after the season had finished. He also said that he received several other offers, but refused to disclose which clubs they were from. Finally, on 9 March 2007, he was unveiled as the new head coach of TAU Cer\u00e1mica, replacing Velimir Perasovi\u0107, who abruptly stepped down in mid-season, due to health reasons. Coincidentally, Maljkovi\u0107 coached Perasovi\u0107 for four years at Jugoplastika.http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/kosarka.php?yyyy=2007&mm;=03\u2146=08&nav;_id=235634 However, after a heavy 14-point loss in the 2007 EuroLeague Final Four to Panathinakos, Maljkovi\u0107 was criticized in the Spanish press, and a lot of speculation appeared about his future. During the off season, he and the club parted ways. On 12 December 2010, he took over the senior Slovenian national basketball team. ===Lokomotiv Kuban=== In the summer of 2011, Maljkovi\u0107 also took over the Russian club Lokomotiv-Kuban. Although close to getting fired in November 2011, due to the club's position in the Russian League being way off expectations,Maljkovi\u0107 dobio otkaz;sportske,net, 11 November 2011Slovenci tvrde da je Maljkovi\u0107 otpu\u0161ten, Rusi demantuju;Blic, 11 November 2011 he was allowed to stay, leading the team to the final four of the VTB United League. He left at the end of the season in May 2012. ===Cedevita=== On 1 July 2012, Maljkovi\u0107 was formally presented as new coach of Croatian vice-champions Cedevita from Zagreb. On 20 November 2012 he resigned as head coach, stating that he no longer had a will or desire to coach the team.http://www.krepsinis.net/eurolyga/b-maljkoviciaus-pasitraukimo- priezastimi-tapo-i-treniruote-neblaivus-atejes-m-tomasas/214711; krepsinis.net 22 November 2012 ==Individual awards== * 2\u00d7 Coach of the Year in Europe (1988\u201389, 1989\u201390) * 2\u00d7 European Coach of the Year awarded by FIBA Basket Magazine (1993, 1996) * 3\u00d7 Coach of the Year in Yugoslavia (1987\u201388, 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390) * 2\u00d7 Coach of the Year in France (1992\u201393, 1993\u201394) ==Coaching style== Maljkovi\u0107 is known as a disciplinarian coach, stressing work ethic, holding grueling and frequent practice sessions. His coaching philosophy is based on defense, declaring in 1996, the year he won his second FIBA European Coach of the Year award: \"What I considered to be good basketball was rejected by many people as lacking in spectacle, but I'm much happier and more likely to win 51\u201350 than to lose 128\u2013124\".OD SVAKOG TRENINGA PRAVIM FINALE ;NIN, 31 December 1996 He also stresses repetition as the key ingredient during practices: Maljkovi\u0107 cites Aca Nikoli\u0107 as the biggest professional influence and considers him \"the best coach of all time, the best craftsman in our business\".Poslednji \u010das sa Profesorom; Glas javnosti, 15 February 2000 Out of respect for his mentor, Maljkovi\u0107 campaigned in 2007 for the Belgrade Arena to be renamed \"Professor Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107 Arena\".Profesor Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107 je zaslu\u017eio da 'Arena' nosi ime po njemu;Blic, 9 February 2007 Although receiving public support from many influential individuals in Serbian basketball, the initiative was ultimately not implemented. Maljkovi\u0107 also holds Ranko \u017deravica in high esteem, considering him to be \"the Dositej Obradovi\u0107 of Serbian basketball, making us basketball-literate\". On numerous occasions Maljkovi\u0107 has stated that Toni Kuko\u010d is the best player he's ever had an opportunity to coach.Maljkovic@Nedjeljom u 2;HRT, 2009 He also frequently praised Michael Young, Louis Bullock, and Audie Norris. Upon taking over the young Jugoplastika team in 1986, Maljkovi\u0107 explicitly forbid his players from celebrating baskets during games. Maljkovi\u0107 said he didn't want his players \"driving airplanes after three-pointers\" citing reigning Euroleague champion and Yugoslav League rival KK Cibona's shooting guard Aco Petrovi\u0107 as a negative example in this regard. Instead, Maljkovi\u0107 said he wanted his players to be \"exemplary young men that no father in Yugoslavia would regret giving away his daughter to\". During his time at Panathinaikos, Maljkovi\u0107 got a chance to coach former NBA star Dominique Wilkins as well as another prominent player from the NBA John Salley, brought in and given big contracts by the club's owner Pavlos Giannakopoulos. Maljkovi\u0107 refused to modify his disciplinarian coaching style when it came to big-name players, treating them in the same stern and strict manner he treated others on the roster, all of which led to numerous run-ins with both Wilkins and Salley. Reporting on this, The New York Times described Maljkovi\u0107 as \"likely to act less like Phil Jackson and more like Bobby Knight\"Retirement Follows Pay Disputes With His Greek Team: Ex-NBA Star Salley Calls It Quits;The New York Times, 26 October 1996 while Sports Illustrated referred to him as \"an austere Serb who believes in my-way-or-Yugo discipline\".No Longer La Dolce Vita;Sports Illustrated, 19 May 1997 His often stated distaste for the NBA is also well known. In 2009, Maljkovi\u0107 said: == Administrative career == In October 2009, Maljkovi\u0107 became a member of the KK Crvena zvezda managing board. === Olympic Committee of Serbia === On 9 May 2017, Maljkovi\u0107 was elected president of the Olympic Committee of Serbia (OKS). He thus succeeded Serbian former basketball player Vlade Divac who had been performing the role since 2009.Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107 novi predsednik Olimpijskog komiteta Srbije! Being the sole candidate for the post since the only other candidate, Ivan Todorov, dropped out four months earlier, Maljkovi\u0107 was elected by acclamation. Earlier in March 2017, two months before the OKS presidential elections, Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107, famous Serbian basketball coach and longtime administrator in the Serbian Basketball Federation (KSS), publicly criticized the election process and further alleged that Maljkovi\u0107 is being installed to the post by the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107: \"No one [from Serbian basketball] seems to be brave enough to publicly talk about the OKS presidential election. The OKS statute has just been changed and nobody says a peep. Vu\u010di\u0107 is ramming down everything in his path in order to install Bo\u017ea Maljkovi\u0107 as the head of the OKS and no one says anything. Everyone knows it, but they're keeping silent. I don't want to name names, but when I ask my basketball administrator friends from the KSS: 'Are you supportive of this thing with Bo\u017ea', they answer 'No' privately. But no one wants to say a word publicly; that's the fear I've been talking about\". == Personal life == Maljkovi\u0107 is the father of Marina Maljkovi\u0107 (born 1981), also a professional basketball coach. ===Row with Vlade Divac=== In August 2011, during the EuroBasket 2011 preparations, Maljkovi\u0107 opened a public row with the Serbian Olympic Committee (OKS) president Vlade Divac, calling the former player a \"fraudster and a liar\" in Croatian sports daily newspaper Sportske novosti as a response to Divac's remark in Slovenian media that Slovenia would've been better off keeping Jure Zdovc as head coach instead of hiring Maljkovi\u0107. The coach expanded on his insults, adding: \"Divac isn't even aware that I got the Slovenia job after Memi Be\u010dirovi\u0107, not after Zdovc. The journalist talking to Divac wasn't kind to him, ringing him up before noon. Considering Divac usually wakes up around 3pm, he was probably still delirious\". When told of Maljkovi\u0107's comments, Divac refused to be drawn into name calling through the media, refusing to say anything more on the subject. However, Maljkovi\u0107 wasn't done, reacting to Divac's non-response with more insults and veiled accusations: \"Divac crossed a line. Every so often he's got excesses like this one in the media. We're two different worlds. It's up to him now whether he wants to start in with me because I got an elaborate file showing what he's all about. I'd only like to add one more thing to my original statement. Divac is a huge fraudster and a huge liar\". The row even prompted 86-year-old Bora Stankovi\u0107, the Serbian basketball's elder statesman, to register his displeasure publicly, scolding both sides. Six years later in August 2017, Maljkovi\u0107 returned to blasting Divac in the Serbian media. Now the Serbian Olympic Committee (OKS) president himself, a post in which he had just succeeded Divac a few months earlier, Maljkovi\u0107 accused his OKS predecessor of scuttling Sa\u0161a \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's previous OKS presidency bid in 2008 by organizing \"illegal elections within the OKS with the help of Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 whom Divac advised at the time\". ===Political views=== In a March 2016 interview for Ve\u010dernje novosti, Maljkovi\u0107 expressed public support for the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 by announcing his intention to vote for him at the upcoming parliamentary election, adding: \"I've met with Vu\u010di\u0107 three times in my life. First, when he was in opposition, we had lunch at Le Moli\u00e8re in Zmaj Jovina. Then second time at the SNS convention to which he had invited me and where I told him: 'I'm here for you whenever you need me, the guys [in power in Serbia] before you never did'. And the third time was when I went to him to correct that historical injustice [about no venue in Serbia being named after Aca Nikoli\u0107] where he reacted phenomenally to my suggestion of changing Pionir's name to the Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107 Hall. Just like he had a monument built in honour of Borislav Peki\u0107, yet another thing the guys [in power in Serbia] before him didn't do. We have a relationship based on mutual respect, I see a tremendous work ethic in him. I won't take part in his election campaign for now, but I'll vote for him\". == See also == * List of EuroLeague-winning head coaches ==References== * Association of Spanish Basketball Coaches ==External links== * Official Website Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Baloncesto M\u00e1laga coaches Category:BKK Radni\u010dki coaches Category:EuroLeague-winning coaches Category:FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet coaches Category:KK Crvena zvezda assistant coaches Category:KK Crvena zvezda youth coaches Category:KK Crvena Zvezda executives Category:KK Lifam coaches Category:KK U\u0161\u0107e coaches Category:KK Split coaches Category:KK Sloga players Category:KK Cedevita coaches Category:Liga ACB head coaches Category:Limoges CSP coaches Category:Panathinaikos B.C. coaches Category:Paris Racing Basket coaches Category:PBC Lokomotiv-Kuban coaches Category:People from Oto\u010dac Category:Real Madrid basketball coaches Category:Saski Baskonia coaches Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Croatia Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in France Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Greece Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Russia Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Slovenia Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:Serbian men's basketball coaches Category:Serbian sports executives and administrators Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:Slovenia national basketball team coaches Category:Yugoslav basketball coaches ",
