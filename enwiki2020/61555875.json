    "text": "Tricky Business is Dave Barry's second novel. It was first published in 2002. Like his previous novel, Big Trouble, its events take place over only 1-2 days, in and around Miami, Florida. ==Synopsis== The Extravaganza of the Seas is a gambling ship headed into a tropical storm, with more immediate trouble in the form of gamblers, crime bosses, gangsters and other shady characters fighting over money and drugs. Wally, a clueless rock guitarist, and Fay, a clever CGIS agent posing as a cocktail waitress, serve as the romantic leads. ==Reception== The book received mixed reviews. CNN said that Barry was \"very good\" at this new direction, writing his first crime comedy.http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/books/10/17/review.tricky.business/index.html Kirkus Reviews said that the book's low humor would appeal to \"all those guys who keep America moving slightly off-course and to the women who love them.\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dave-barry/tricky-business/ Publisher's Weekly wrote that Barry showed his \"penchant\" for potty humor and slapstick, but was able to craft \"some captivating characters and keep a reader's attention\" throughout.https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-14924-5 ==References== Category:2002 American novels Category:Novels by Dave Barry Category:American comedy novels Category:G.
