    "text": "Thinking Out Loud is the seventh studio album by guitarist Frank Gambale, released in 1995 through Victor Entertainment and reissued on 24 April 2001 through Samson Records. ==Critical reception== Scott Yanow at AllMusic awarded Thinking Out Loud two stars out of five. He described it as \"sounding unexpectedly close to George Benson\", but Gambale's compositions were criticised as weak (\"funky but without soul or any worthwhile melodies\") and Dave Weckl's performances as \"remarkably dull automatic pilot drumming\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Thinking Out Loud is credited to the following: *Frank Gambale \u2013 composition, guitar, mixing, production *Libby Lavella \u2013 vocals *Otmaro Ru\u00edz \u2013 keyboard (tracks 1, 7, 9) *David Goldblatt \u2013 keyboard (tracks 2, 4\u20136, 8) *Brian Auger \u2013 Hammond organ *Dave Weckl \u2013 drums *Walfredo Reyes, Jr. \u2013 percussion *Tim Landers \u2013 bass (tracks 1, 5, 6, 8, 9) *Alphonso Johnson \u2013 bass (tracks 2\u20134, 7, 10) *Robert M.
