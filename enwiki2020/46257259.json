    "text": "Valley of Love is a 2015 French film directed by Guillaume Nicloux, starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert. It tells the story of two French people who used to be a couple and had a son 25 years ago. They reunite after the son's death, having received a letter asking them to visit five places in Death Valley, which will make the son reappear. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It film won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Cinematography at the 41st C\u00e9sar Awards. ==Plot== G\u00e9rard and Isabelle, a French couple separated for decades, meet up at a desert motel in California. Each has received a letter from their son Micha\u00ebl, who killed himself in San Francisco six months earlier, asking them to visit certain spots in Death Valley on certain days, when he will reappear to them. While Isabelle has stayed petite and attractive, she is shocked to see that G\u00e9rard is in poor health and enormous. The two squabble and sentimentalise, sometimes wondering if an old flame could be reignited and sometimes sick of the other's company. Grumbling at the apparent pointlessness of the mission, and wilting under the intense heat, they nevertheless follow Micha\u00ebl's instructions. One night back at the motel, Isabelle panics and G\u00e9rard rushes to her room. She is convinced there was an intruder, who could have been Micha\u00ebl. She says he seized her ankles, which afterwards exhibit a mysterious inflammation. Out together in the desert, G\u00e9rard walks on alone and returns to Isabelle in panic, convinced that he met Micha\u00ebl, who seized his wrists. Later, they too become inflamed. The film ends there, leaving viewers to ponder what meaning the couple will draw from their experience and whether it may bring them closer again. ==Cast== * Isabelle Huppert as Isabelle * G\u00e9rard Depardieu as G\u00e9rard ==Production== The film was produced through Les Films du Worso and LGM Cin\u00e9ma, with co-production support from DD Productions, France 3 Cin\u00e9ma and Belgium's Scope Pictures.
