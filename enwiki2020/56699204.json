Background (left to right) Trump International Hotel and Tower, Tribune Tower, and Wrigley Building; midground (l to r) Chicago Tribune printing plant and WGN-TV building, foreground proposed new tower site. Tribune East Tower is an approved mixed use supertall tower to be built on the eastern edge of the Tribune Tower property, in the Streeterville area of Chicago. The building plans received final approval on May 8, 2020. Construction is expected to begin in 2021 or 2022. When completed, the skyscraper would become the second-tallest in Chicago after Willis Tower. ==History== Tribune Tower and the adjacent Chicago Tribune printing plant (from the south) Tribune Tower sits on the southwest corner of property that includes four buildings and a surface parking lot. The other buildings are (clockwise) the four-story 1935 WGN Radio building, the eleven- story 1950 WGN-TV building, and the old Chicago Tribune printing plant, with the parking lot immediately east of all of these buildings. The Tower itself was declared an official Chicago landmark by the city in 1989. In early September 2016, prospective buyers of the Tribune Tower property had redevelopment plans for the adjacent Pioneer Court that were at odds with local interests to protect views of Tribune Tower. Nonetheless, later that month, Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower and adjacent property totaling , including the surface parking lot, to the partnership. At the time of the purchase, the partnership of Los Angeles-based CIM Group and Chicago's Golub & Co. sought input on how to redevelop the properties, although 42nd District Alderman Brendan Reilly noted that he would protect views of the Tower from the Michigan Avenue Bridge to the south and the Ogden Slip to the east. By 2017, there were expectations that the parternership would plan a skyscraper tower to the east of Tribune Tower, even though no plans had been made public. In January 2018, plans emerged for a skyscraper on the northern portion of the parking lot on the east side of the Tribune Tower property. Plans called for 220 hotel rooms and 158 condominium units; the tower would be slightly shorter than the Trump International Hotel and Tower. The new skyscraper is being designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture of Chicago. As an employee of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Adrian Smith had designed Trump Tower and the Burj Khalifa, which became the tallest building in the world in 2010. Originally envisioned at and standing nearly three times as tall as the 36-story Tribune Tower, the Tribune East Tower may still face opposition for obstructing views of the Tower, as well as \"dwarfing\" it from a historical perspective. Plans were officially announced for a tall 200-unit hotel, 439-apartment and 125-condominium building on April 16, 2018. These plans make the building shorter than the Willis Tower, the city's tallest. The proposal outlined several details, including funding earmarked for affordable housing and neighborhood opportunity as well as plans for the rest of the Tribune Tower property. At the time of its initial proposal, the planned building had no official name, but it was referred to as Tribune East by the media. On mid- October 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the city's second tallest building. Chicago City Council approved the plans in an October 31 meeting. Minor revisions were unveiled on November 20, 2019, and on May 8, 2020, the project received final approval and construction is expected to begin in late 2021 or early 2022. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in the United States ==Notes== ==External links== *Tribune East at Emporis *Tribune East Tower at SkyscraperPage Category:Central Chicago Category:Condo hotels in the United States Category:Proposed buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States Category:Hotels in Chicago Category:Residential condominiums in Chicago Category:Residential skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Skyscraper hotels in Chicago ",
