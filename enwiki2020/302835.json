The population of Marijampol\u0117 is 48,700 (2003). It is the Lithuanian center of the Suvalkija region. Marijampol\u0117 is the seventh-largest city in Lithuania, and has been its regional center since 1994. The city covers an area equal to . The \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 River divides the city into two parts which are connected by six bridges. ==Names== The city has also been known as Marijampolis, Mariampol, Starapole, Pa\u0161e\u0161upiai, Marjampol, Mariyampole, and Kapsukas (1955\u20131989). ==History== The settlement was founded as a village called \"Pa\u0161e\u0161up\u0117\", after the nearby river of \u0160e\u0161up\u0117. As such the town was first mentioned in 1667. In the 18th century the village, at that time belonging to the Catholic Church, grew to become a market town and its name was changed to Starpol or \"Staropole\", after a new village built for Prienai starost's guards in the vicinity in 1739. The settlement was destroyed by a fire in 1765. After the disaster the wife of contemporary starost of Prienai, Pranci\u0161ka Butlerien\u0117 n\u00e9e \u0160\u010diukait\u0117, financed a new church and a monastery for the Congregation of Marian Fathers. Following the foundation of the monastery, a new town was built in the area. It was named \"Maryampol\", after the Blessed Virgin Mary (Marya-), with the Greek suffix -pol denoting a town.Cognate with the Greek suffix -polis. The modern Lithuanian name of the town also follows the same etymology. There are at least ten settlements of the same name in modern Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, all sharing a similar etymology. On February 23, 1792 King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus granted the \"townlet of Mariampol\" with Magdeburg Law and a privilege of market organisation. Following the Partitions of Poland the town was briefly part of Prussia. However, after the Napoleonic Wars it was transferred to Congress Poland (\"Russian Poland\"). In the 19th century the town continued to grow, mostly thanks to a large number of Jewish and German settlers. In 1817 the town became the seat of a separate powiat within the administrative system of the kingdom. In 1827 the town had 1759 inhabitants. By 1861 the number had grown to 3718, 3015 of them being Jewish. A fire consumed many wooden homes in 1868. As a result, many houses were rebuilt of stone.Translation of the Marijampol\u0117 chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Lita Following the January Uprising and the Russian suppression of the former Commonwealth lands, the powiat of Maryampol was seriously diminished. Around that time also the monastery gained prominence as it was the only monastery owned by the Marians that was not closed down by the tsarist authorities. As the surroundings of the town were primarily inhabited by Lithuanians, the town became the centre of the Lithuanian national revival. The proximity of the Prussian border made the smuggling of books in Lithuanian language, banned in Imperial Russia, easier. Among the most notable Lithuanian scholars and writers active in Mariampol at that time were Kazys Grinius, Jonas Jablonskis and Vincas Kudirka. Monument to Deported Lithuanians in Marijampol\u0117 Following World War I the town became part of Lithuania and was renamed to its current name Marijampol\u0117. During World War II Marijampol\u0117 was occupied by the Soviet Union. During 1940\u20131941 Soviet authorities deported several hundred inhabitants of Marijampol\u0117. In 1941 Nazi Germany occupied the town. On 1 September 1941, between 5,000 and 8,000 Jews from Marijampol\u0117, Kalvarija and elsewhere, along with people from other backgrounds, were murdered. Their bodies were placed in mass graves near the \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 River. Most of the murderers were Lithuanian.The Jaeger Report In the effect of the war the town was heavily damaged and almost emptied. On July 31, 1944 Soviet army once again entered the city.

Currently in Marijampol\u0117 roughly 98% of its inhabitants are Lithuanians.
