Mardava as a divine quality is to be lenient with those who make mistakes, to never be offended and remains always quiet when people revile or ignore God. To be gentle is to make friends easily. It is to know that ignorance is the likely reasons for the naysaying response. Mardava is softness, letting go of ego. Mardava is a gentleness with all objects and weakness, it is compassion extended to the lifeless and weak, Swami Tejomay\u0101nanda explains: > \"We can augment our compassion with the practice of m\u0101rdavam or gentleness. > This is an attitude of mind that is not only limited to living things but > extends to insentient material objects as well. If we handle all the things > with care, they will serve us beautifully. For instance, some people take > proper care of their cars but others are so rough with them, there is no > gentleness when they apply the brake, change gears or shut the door. In the > same way, we should remember that shoes are serving our feet and we should > place them down with respect. Once a man came running to a Zen Master, threw > his shoes here and there and fell at his feet saying, Please teach me about > God. The Master calmly replied, First learn to respect your shoes. How we > take care of inert objects reveals the state of the mind. This m\u0101rdavam is a > disposition of the mind. When a person has this state of mind, all his > actions have a quality of gentleness. In Hinduism, there are eight a\u015btop\u0101yas, or eight ways of attaining moksha, and M\u0101rdava is one of them, the other seven being \u2013 Yajna (\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e) (sacrifices), D\u0101na (\u0926\u093e\u0928) (charity), Vedadhyayana (the study of the Vedas), Tapas (\u0924\u092a) (penance, deep meditation), Dama (\u0926\u092e) (subduing the senses by restraining the sense-organs), Satya (\u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f) (truth in speech and act), and Ty\u0101ga (\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917) (renunciation of desire). In Jainism, m\u0101rdava or compassion or supreme tenderness or humility, which is part of Right Belief, is a means to destroy vanity or egotism which gives rise to many evils which defile the virtues of our soul; it is held that humility is the foundation of compassion and the basis for salvation. With the eight kinds of pride totally avoided, knowledge brings humility. Tattv\u0101rthas\u016btra (IX.6) lists m\u0101rdava (modesty) as one of the ten aspects of the highest dharma . Bhagavad Gita (XVI.1-3) also classifies m\u0101rdava as a divine quality and the Buddhists consider m\u0101rdava as the realization of Dharma (dharma-pratipatti). Patanjali mentions m\u0101rdava as a low pitch along with anvavavasarga and udut\u0101 khasya; he explains this word as svarasya mridut\u0101 or snigdhat\u0101 (smoothness of sound). ==See also== *Aesop's Fables, and The North Wind and the Sun ==References== Category:Vedanta Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Jain philosophical concepts ",
