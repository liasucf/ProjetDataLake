The Red Republican published the first English translation of the Communist Manifesto in 1850, but was not a financial success and closed down in December of the same year. Subsequently, Harney published the Friend of the People (December 1850 - April 1852), Star of Freedom (April 1852 - December 1852) and The Vanguard (January 1853 - March 1853). ==External links== * The Red republican & the friend of the people.
