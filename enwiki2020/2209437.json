Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level polic\u00eda Nacional or Guardia civil to 9 months for a mosso, but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including Madrid's or Barcelona's are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialised courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree. The Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private academias training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand.

Each state has an agency that certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification. In an analysis of training requirements in several states by Gawker \"found Louisiana law enforcement recruits typically attend 360 hours of training, while the national average is slightly more than 600 hours. Louisiana requires less hours of training for law enforcement than the 1,500 hours needed to become a certified barber, the website said. Washington, D.C., requires the most police academy training hours in the nation, at 1,120.\" ====Federal==== While some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Marshals Service), require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). FLETC, which is operated by the Department of Homeland Security, and is headquartered in Glynco, Georgia with training sites in Artesia, New Mexico, Charleston, South Carolina and Cheltenham, Maryland. ====Connecticut==== In Connecticut, police officer recruits receive a certification to enforce the General Statutes.

All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified. ====Kentucky==== All law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS) prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer. Larger agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police, as well as the Louisville Metro Police and the Lexington Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 20-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and located on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond. Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the Kentucky Constitution. These include sheriffs, constables, coroners and jailers, (though generally not deputies). Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office. ====Maryland==== In Maryland, the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major law enforcement agencies operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, defensive tactics, report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of First Responder, and a 40-hour block of weapon training. Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the Maryland State Police requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.Recruiting.mdsp.org Many colleges such as the University of Maryland and other community colleges offer police academy instruction as well.Outlook.umd.edu ====Michigan==== In Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of community colleges, city or county police and sheriff departments, or the Michigan State Police. After the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity. ====New Hampshire==== New Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law. The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification. Most agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires. ====Texas==== The agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the Texas Department of Public Safety which trains state troopers, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department who train game wardens, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice that trains state corrections officers. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers). ====Utah==== The basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures. ===Vietnam=== Located in Tu Liem district, Hanoi, Vietnam, The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the Vietnam People's Public Security, training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.
