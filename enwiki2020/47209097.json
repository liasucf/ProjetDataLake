    "text": "St Andrew's Church Hall is a heritage-listed church hall at Mangerton Street, Toogoolawah, Somerset Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1906 by A D Menzies. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. == History == This small weatherboard hall was erected in 1906 for the Anglican congregation in Toogoolawah, on land in Mangerton Street owned by Mary Elizabeth McConnel of Cressbrook. This site is now the vacant block to the south of the rectory, the hall having been moved to its present location beside the church. The town of Cressbrook Creek (later Toogoolawah) was founded when Mary McConnel's husband, JH McConnel, subdivided a large section of the Cressbrook estate in the late 1890s, and established a condensed milk factory on Cressbrook Creek in 1898. The town expanded when the Brisbane Valley railway line was completed in 1904 providing a connection to Ipswich. It is believed Mary McConnel paid for the construction of the hall. Probably the builder was AD Menzies, who erected most of the buildings in Toogoolawah until the mid-1920s. The hall was opened by the Archbishop in September 1906, and Anglican services were held there until St Andrew's Church was erected in 1911-1912. Subsequently the building became the Sunday School hall, and in 1920 the church purchased from Mrs McConnel both the hall and the site, for the sum of \u00a3100. The building has been moved since to its present location beside the church, and has undergone a number of alterations. == Description == This single-storeyed timber building is set amongst mature trees on a corner site forming the northwestern boundary to McConnel Park. St Andrew's Church is located on the northern side of the building and St Andrew's rectory and its grounds are to the south. The building has a corrugated iron gabled roof with a skillion roof to the rear kitchenette and a gabled roof to the front porch. The exterior is dark painted weatherboard, matching St Andrew's Church, and sits on timber stumps. The front porch has a solid weatherboard balustrade and a decorative timber front gable with a metal finial. The windows now have glass louvres and the timber trim is painted white. Internal walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. == Heritage listing == St Andrew's Church Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.
