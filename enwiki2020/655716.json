    "text": "Frederick of Lorraine (1371 - October 25, 1415 in the battle of Agincourt) was a Count of Vaud\u00e9mont. He was the son of Duke John I of Lorraine and younger brother of Charles II. In 1393, Frederick married Margaret the heiress of Vaud\u00e9mont and Joinville, and became Count of these lands in her right. He founded the House of Vaud\u00e9mont, a junior branch of the House of Lorraine. His children were: *Antoine, who succeeded as Count of Vaud\u00e9mont, *Elisabeth, who married Philipp I of Nassau-Weilburg, and *Margaret, who married Thibault II of Blamont. Dynastic problems in the senior line caused his great-grandson Ren\u00e9 of Vaud\u00e9mont to become Duke of Lorraine as Ren\u00e9 II in 1473. ==See also== *Dukes of Lorraine family tree Category:House of Vaud\u00e9mont Category:Counts of Vaud\u00e9mont Category:1371 births Category:1415 deaths Category:Military personnel killed in action ",
