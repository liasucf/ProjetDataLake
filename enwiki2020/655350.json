    "text": "Cynisca by Sophie de Renneville Cynisca or Kyniska (; born c. 440 BC) was a Spartan princess. In 396 BC, she became the first woman in history to win at the ancient Olympic Games. ==Early life== Cynisca was born around 440 BC in the ancient Greek city of Sparta and was the daughter of the Eurypontid king of Sparta, Archidamus II, and Eupoleia. She was also the sister of the later king of Sparta, Agesilaus II. She is said to have been a tomboy, an expert equestrian and very wealthy, the perfect qualifications for a successful trainer. She was exceedingly ambitious to succeed at the Olympic Games and the first woman to breed horses and win an Olympic victory, according to Pausanias.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3.8.1-3. Her name means 'female puppy' in Ancient Greek. She was named after her grandfather Zeuxidamus, who was called Cyniscos.Herod, vi 7 It is possible that this name related to a specific kind of dog in Sparta, the female bloodhounds which were famous for their ability to find their quarries by their scent. ==Olympic Games== While most women in the ancient Greek world were kept in seclusion and forbidden to learn any kind of skills in sports, riding or hunting, Spartan women by contrast were brought up from girlhood to excel at these things so as to produce strong children, by going through early training similar to that of their brothers. The ancient Olympic Games were almost entirely male-only and women were forbidden even to set foot in the main stadium at Olympia, where running events and combat sports were held. Women were allowed to enter only the equestrian events, not by running but by owning and training the horses. Cynisca employed men and entered her team at the Olympics, where it won in the four-horse chariot racing (tethrippon Greek: \u03c4\u03ad\u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd) twice, in 396 BC and again in 392 BC. The irony is that she probably didn't see her victories. According to Xenophon, she was encouraged to breed horses and compete in the Games, by her brother Agesilaus II, in an attempt to discredit the sport. He viewed success in chariot racing as a victory without merit, which was only a mark of wealth and lavish outlay due to the involvement of the horses' owner, while in the other events the decisive factor was a man's bravery and virtue.Xenophon, Minor Works, Agesilaus 9.1 \u00a76.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Agesilaus 20.1 By having a woman win, he hoped to show the sport to be unmanly, but Cynisca's victories did not stop wealthy Spartans engaging in the sport. However, Cynisca was honored by having a bronzePausanias, Description of Greece, 5.12.5. statue of a chariot and horses, a charioteer and a statue of herself in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, by the side of the statue of Troilus, made by Apelleas, and an inscription written declaring that she was the only female to win the wreath in the chariot events at the Olympic Games.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 6.1.6. The first person in the inscription indicates that Cynisca was willing to push herself forward and Xenophon says that this inscription was Agesilaus' idea. In addition to this, a hero-shrine of Cynisca was erected in Sparta at Plane-tree Grove,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3.15.1. where religious ceremonies were held. Only Spartan kings were graced in this way and Cynisca was the first woman to receive this honor. The inscription from Olympia (c. 390-380 BC) reads:IvO 160 :English :Kings of Sparta are my father and brothers :Kyniska, victorious with a chariot of swift-footed horses, :have erected this statue. I declare myself the only woman :in all Hellas to have won this crown. :Apelleas son of Kallikles made it. :Ancient Greek : ==Culture== Cynisca's win in the Olympics had a great impact on the ancient Greek world as other women, not only Lacedaemonians, later won the chariot racing, including Euryleonis, Belistiche, Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione, Timareta, Theodota (both from Elis) and Cassia. However, none of them was more distinguished for their victories than she was. Zoe Karelli, a modern Greek poet, wrote a poem for Cynisca's love for the horses and her Olympic win which made her name famous in Greek history. This Spartan princess is frequently used until today as a symbolic figure of the social rise of woman. Her Hero-shrine was placed near the Platanistas, where violent contests were held for boys aged 18\u201320, suggesting that as well as being celebrated among women, she was popular among men as well, as the location of her shrine suggests that young men were the focus of her cult. Upon her death, she was treated as a woman with heroic qualities, though not herself a bona fide heroine. ==See also== *Euryleonis another celebrated Spartan woman who won the two horse chariot races in 368 BC. ==References== ==External links== *The No Woman Rule in Ancient Olympics *Spartan Olympic Victors *The Spartans on Channel 4 *Pausanias, Description of Greece, online at Perseus Bibliography *Paul Cartledge, The Spartans: An Epic History, 2nd edition 2003. *Stephen Hodkinson, Property and Wealth in Classical Sparta, The Classical Press of Wales, 2000. *S.
