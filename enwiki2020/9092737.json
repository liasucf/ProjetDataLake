    "text": "In calculus, a branch of mathematics, the third derivative is the rate at which the second derivative, or the rate of change of the rate of change, is changing, used to define aberrancy. The third derivative of a function f(x)=y can be denoted by :\\frac{d^3y}{dx^3},\\quad f(x),\\quad\\text{or }\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[f(x)]. Other notations can be used, but the above are the most common. ==Mathematical definitions== Let f(x)=x^4. Then f'(x)=4x^3, and f(x)=12x^2. Therefore, the third derivative of f(x) is, in this case, : f(x)=24x or, using Leibniz notation, : \\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[x^4]=24x Now for a more general definition. Let f(x) be any function of x. Then the third derivative of f(x) is given by the following: : \\frac{d^3}{dx^3}[f(x)]=\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] The third derivative is the rate at which the second derivative (f(x)) is changing. ==Applications in geometry== In differential geometry, the torsion of a curve \u2014 a fundamental property of curves in three dimensions \u2014 is computed using third derivatives of coordinate functions (or the position vector) describing the curve. ==Applications in physics== In physics, particularly kinematics, jerk is defined as the third derivative of the position function of an object. It is, essentially, the rate at which acceleration changes. In mathematical terms: : \\mathbf{j}(t)=\\frac{d^3\\mathbf{r}}{dt^3} where j(t) is the jerk function with respect to time, and r(t) is the position function of the object with respect to time. ==Economic example== When campaigning for a second term in office, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the rate of increase of inflation was decreasing, which has been noted as \"the first time a sitting president used the third derivative to advance his case for reelection.\" Since inflation is itself a derivative\u2014the rate at which the purchasing power of money decreases\u2014then the rate of increase of inflation is the derivative of inflation, opposite in sign to the second time derivative of the purchasing power of money. Stating that a function is decreasing is equivalent to stating that its derivative is negative, so Nixon's statement is that the second derivative of inflation is negative, and so the third derivative of purchasing power is positive. Nixon's statement allowed for the rate of inflation to increase, however, so his statement was not as indicative of stable prices as it sounds. ==See also== *Derivative (mathematics) *Second derivative ==References== Category:Differential calculus ",
