    "text": "Royal Friesland Foods (Koninklijke Friesland Foods N.V.) was a Dutch company that developed, produced and sold branded dairy products and fruit-based drinks. Royal Friesland Foods had a strong presence in Western Europe, Central Europe, West Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2008, Friesland Foods merged with Campina, under the new name of FrieslandCampina. The process was announced in December 2007. The EU conditioned the merger to the sale of certain cheese and dairy drink divisions by both companies. ==Overview== Royal Friesland Foods employs 15,312, of whom 10,000 work outside the Netherlands. The cooperative's leading brands are Appelsientje, Bonnet, Chocomel/C\u00e9c\u00e9mel, Completa, CoolBest, Debic, DubbelFrisss, Dutch Lady, Extran, Frico, Friso, Foremost, Friesche Vlag, Frisian Flag, Fristi, Milli, NoyNoy, Peak, P\u00f6tty\u00f6s T\u00far\u00f3 Rudi, Rainbow, and Taksi. Royal Friesland Foods is organized as a cooperative, with roots going back to 1879. It has grown through mergers and takeovers, the most significant of which occurred in late 1997, when four Dutch dairy cooperatives joined to create the business in its current form. In December 2001, KFF NV acquired the Drinks & Dairy division of Numico including the brands Chocomel/C\u00e9c\u00e9mel, Fristi and Extran. Royal Friesland Foods gained its current name in June 2004 after Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands granted it the Royal status (\"Koninklijk\" in Dutch) in honour of its 125th anniversary. Prior to that, the company was known as Friesland Coberco Dairy Foods. ==Longevity Brand - S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd== In Vietnam, the U.S. and Canada the company is well known for its canned condensed milk product, S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd (Longevity Brand condensed milk), popularly used in Vietnamese iced coffee with milk (C\u00e0 ph\u00ea s\u1eefa \u0111\u00e1) drinks, and in various other Vietnamese desserts. S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd was mass-produced in the Saigon-Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a area and widely consumed in the Republic of Vietnam, produced by Friesland Foods prior 1975. It was used in coffee, mixed with hot water to produce hot milk for babies and young children to drink (since fresh milk had to be imported and were thus expensive), dipped with French bread (B\u00e1nh m\u00ec) or in other dessert applications. After the 1975 Fall of Saigon, the factories manufacturing S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd, along with all other commercial and private properties were collectivized by the communists, and the facilities came under the state company Vinamilk, who continued to produce S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd condensed milk under the same name and used domestically and elsewhere in Indochina. Friesland Foods continued production of S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd - Longevity Brand after 1975 in the U.S. and Canada for the North American market, especially catering to Overseas Vietnamese consumers, and increasingly to Western consumers as the popularity of Vietnamese coffee and cuisine in general, increases. In North America, Longevity Brand - S\u1eefa \u00d4ng Th\u1ecd is widely available in Asian supermarkets, and increasingly in conventional supermarkets. == 2008 baby milk scandal == Filled Evaporated Milk Dutch Lady Friesland Foods In September 2008, the testing of Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) found that the \"Dutch Lady\" brand of strawberry flavoured milk manufactured in China to be contaminated with melamine. This product was recalled and destroyed. Friesland Foods recalled all of its plastic-bottled milk in Hong Kong and Macau. == References == ==External links== *Company website (English language version) *Royal Friesland Foods media release September 9 2004 * Dairy Industries International July 2004 v69 i7 page 7 article about name change Wilmington International Category:FrieslandCampina Category:Defunct companies of the Netherlands Category:Cooperatives in the Netherlands Category:Multinational food companies Category:Dutch companies established in 1879 Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 2008 Category:Dairy cooperatives Category:Dairy products companies of the Netherlands Category:Companies based in Drenthe Category:Food and drink companies established in 1879 Category:Dutch companies disestablished in 2008 ",
