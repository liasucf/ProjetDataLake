    "text": "All Mirrors is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Angel Olsen, released through Jagjaguwar on October 4, 2019. Produced by Angel Olsen and John Congleton, the album was preceded by two singles, the title track and \"Lark\". Both releases were accompanied by music videos directed by Olsen's friend and longtime collaborator Ashley Connors. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics and debuted at No. 52 on the Billboard 200. In August 2020 Olsen released Whole New Mess, an album featuring rearranged and rerecorded versions of select songs from All Mirrors. ==Critical reception== Stephen Deusner of Uncut praised the album, writing, \"Even for an artist who has redefined herself with every record, All Mirrors is her boldest reinvention yet.\" Victoria Segal of Mojo gave the album a favorable review, writing, \"Behind the parachute silk and dry ice, the smoke and mirrors, stands a record in high emotional definition, its outline becoming sharper by the second.\" Rachel Aroesti of Q wrote, \"Novel and nostalgic, accessible and eccentric, All Mirrors strikes an impressive balance between the familiar and strange \u2013 resulting in an album that\u2019s startling and breathtakingly beautiful.\" In the review for AllMusic, Marcy Donelson commended Olsen by claiming that \"Though she may have initially built her reputation on stark and brittle atmospheres, it turns out that her trademark vulnerability is only elevated by these stirring, highly stylized interpretations, making it a risk that pays off in spades.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians * Angel Olsen \u2013 vocals , guitar , synthesizer , piano ; string arrangements * Joshua Jaeger \u2013 drums , percussion * Ben Babbitt \u2013 electric bass , electric guitar , synthesizer drones , Mellotron drones , synthesizers , bass synthesizer , baritone guitar , E-bow electric guitar , piano , Mellotron , 12-string acoustic guitar , vibraphone , upright bass , fuzz bass , additional string textures on violin and cello ; string arrangements * Jherek Bischoff \u2013 string conducting ; string arrangements * Paris Hurley \u2013 violin I * Laurann Angel \u2013 violin I * Crystal Brooke Alforque \u2013 violin I * Emily Call \u2013 violin II * Rachel Iba \u2013 violin II * Michelle Luna \u2013 violin II * Madeline Falcone \u2013 viola * Lauren Elizabeth Baba \u2013 viola * Marta Sofia Honer \u2013 viola * Aniela Marie Perry \u2013 cello * April Guthrie \u2013 cello * Nathaniel Walcott \u2013 trumpet , flugelhorn ; brass arrangement * Vikram Devasthali \u2013 trombone Technical personnel * John Congleton \u2013 production, mixing * Angel Olsen \u2013 production * Sean Cook \u2013 assistant engineering * Greg Calbi \u2013 mastering * Ben Babbitt \u2013 pre-production Artwork * Cameron McCool \u2013 album photography * Angel Olsen \u2013 styling * Jack Pitney \u2013 styling * Elyse Lightner \u2013 styling * Miles Johnson \u2013 art direction ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 199 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 28 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 69 |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Angel Olsen albums Category:Jagjaguwar albums Category:Albums produced by John Congleton ",
