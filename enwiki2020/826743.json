Formed by students of St. Louis University High School in 1988, MU330 played a self-described brand of music called \"Psycho Ska\", high energy ska punk marked by manic performances and humorous, often strange lyricism. Since 1997, however, the band's musical direction has shifted towards a more melodic and lyric-driven ska/indie rock sound, a combination that's been described as \"Weezer meets The Specials\".Asian Man Records: Crab Rangoon Asian Man Records. Dan Potthast (guitar/vocals), Ted Moll (drums), Chris Diebold (bass) and Robert Bell (trombone) have remained with MU330 since the band's inception, while trombonist Gerry Lundquist has been a member for over a decade. Though several different frontmen have been featured in the past, Potthast has always acted as the band's principal songwriter and lyricist. ==Biography== The original members met in St. Louis University High School music class 330 (hence the name of the band).[ AllMusic MU330 - Biography] Singer Dan Potthast has released solo work and has also started a second band The Stitch Up with former Slow Gherkin frontman James Rickman.
