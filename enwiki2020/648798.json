In principle, these tests were distinct from any political decision to join. The five tests were as follows:HM Treasury - GOVERNMENT POLICY ON EMU AND THE FIVE ECONOMIC TESTS #Are business cycles and economic structures compatible so that we and others could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis? #If problems emerge is there sufficient flexibility to deal with them? #Would joining EMU create better conditions for firms making long-term decisions to invest in Britain? #What impact would entry into EMU have on the competitive position of the UK's financial services industry, particularly the City's wholesale markets? #In summary, will joining EMU promote higher growth, stability and a lasting increase in jobs? In addition to these self-imposed criteria the UK would also have had to have met the European Union's economic convergence criteria (\"Maastricht criteria\") before being allowed to adopt the euro. One criterion is two years' membership of ERM II, of which the UK was never a member. Under the Maastricht Treaty, the UK was not obliged to adopt the euro. When the Brown government was voted out of office in the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the tests ceased to be government policy. ==History of the tests== The five tests were designed in 1997 by former British Labour Party Chancellor Gordon Brown and his then special adviser Ed Balls, which is often claimed to have been developed in the back of a taxi while Brown was in the United States, though this has later been discredited. Despite this uncertain pedigree, the International Monetary Fund deemed them to be \"broadly consistent with the economic considerations that are relevant for assessing entry into a monetary union.\"International Monetary Fund - United Kingdom: 2001 IMF Article IV Consultation; Concluding Statement of the Mission December 11, 2001 The UK Treasury is responsible for assessing the tests. It first did so in October 1997, when it was decided that the UK economy was neither sufficiently converged with that of the rest of the EU, nor sufficiently flexible, to justify a recommendation of membership at that time. The government pledged to reassess the tests early in the next Parliament (which began in June 2001), and published a revised assessment of the five tests in June 2003. This assessment ran to around 250 pages and was backed up by eighteen supporting studies, on subjects such as housing, labour market flexibility, and the euro area's monetary and fiscal frameworks. The conclusions were broadly similar; the Treasury argued that: # There had been significant progress on convergence since 1997, but there remained some significant structural differences, such as in the housing market. # While UK flexibility had improved, they could not be confident that it is sufficient. # Euro membership would increase investment, but only if convergence and flexibility were sufficient. # The City of London, Britain's financial centre, would benefit from Eurozone membership. # Growth, stability and employment would increase as a result of euro membership, but only if convergence and flexibility were sufficient. On the basis of this assessment, in May-June 2003, the government ruled out UK membership of the euro for the duration of the Parliament. Since Labour was re-elected in 2005, the debate on the European Constitution and subsequent Treaty of Lisbon upstaged that on the euro. Gordon Brown, in his first press conference as British Prime Minister (2007), ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.Times online - Puritanism comes too naturally for 'Huck' Brown However, in late 2008, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (the European Commission President) stated differently; that UK leaders were seriously considering the switch amidst the financial crisis.EUobserver - Britain closer to euro, Barroso says Brown later denied this.AFP - Britain says no change on euro after EU chief's claim One of the underlying issues that stand in the way of monetary union is the structural difference between the UK housing market and those of many continental European countries. Although home ownership in Britain is near the European average, variable rate mortgages are more common, making the retail price index in Britain more influenced by interest rate changes.MacLennan, D., Muellbauer, J. and Stephens, M.
