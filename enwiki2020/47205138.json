    "text": "Ted Gonder (born January 4, 1990) is an American entrepreneur and the co- founding CEO of Moneythink, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building the financial capability of young adults through technology-enhanced peer mentorship. Until July 2015, he was also a member of the U.S. President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans. ==Early years and education== After seeing Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth and attending the 2006 Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation Seminar, Gonder launched Project Cooldown, a nonprofit that brought climate change awareness campaigns to high schools across his native California. In 2007, The Climate Project, an organization founded by Gore, appointed Gonder as a student advisor. Gonder earned a BA in Geography from the University of Chicago. As a student at the university, he co-founded Moneythink as a service learning club. Gonder also founded the University of Chicago Entrepreneurship Society (now called Edge UChicago). ==Career== In 2008, Gonder, Shashin Chokshi, David Chen, and Greg Nance established the \u201cAmerican Investment Fellows\u201d club at the University of Chicago based on Nance\u2019s idea to send students from the university\u2019s investment club into local high schools to teach workshops. After the success of a pilot program at the South Shore School of Leadership, the initiative began to spread to campuses across the country. In 2009, the organization was officially rebranded as Moneythink, at which point Morgan Hartley joined as the organization\u2019s fifth co-founder. In 2011, Gonder interned at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, where he researched the relationship between government and startups in Chile. After completing his assignment in Chile and returning to the U.S. later that year, he decided to pursue Moneythink as a full-time venture. In 2012, Gonder spoke on behalf of Moneythink when it was named a White House Champion of Change, and declared that the organization\u2019s goal was to make youth financial capability a social norm in the U.S. by 2030. He also became the organization\u2019s first executive director. From February 2012 to May 2013, Gonder served as entrepreneur in residence at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where he collaborated with other entrepreneurs and senior government officials on initiatives to streamline pathways for foreign entrepreneurs to more easily immigrate to the U.S., grow businesses, and create jobs. In June 2013, Gonder founded the World Economic Forum's Chicago Global Shapers hub. He remains an active Global Shaper today. From February 2014 to June 2015, Gonder served on the U.S. President\u2019s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans. The council\u2019s report addressed methods of improving the financial capability of young people in the U.S., including better financial education training for teachers; more access to information about post-secondary education for low- income and minority youth; greater involvement of cities and local communities in young adults\u2019 financial education; and increased integration of technology in promoting access to finance. ==Honors and awards== * In 2015, Gonder was named to Forbes' \u201c30 Under 30 in Finance\u201d.
