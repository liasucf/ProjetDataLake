(The Czech Republic, as a member of the Schengen Zone, cannot unilaterally implement visa requirements or controls for Canadian citizens). On 6 May 2009 at the Canada- EU Summit in Prague (Czech Republic's capital) started negotiations of Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a proposed free trade and copyright agreement between Canada and the European Union. Signing and ratification by the Czech Republic are required for CETA to come into effect. Czech Republic declared it won't do either until the visa requirements by Canada are lifted. On 14 Nov 2013 the Canadian ambassador to the Czech Republic Otto Jelinek announced reinstatement of visa-free regime for Czech citizens. == See also == * Foreign relations of Canada * Foreign relations of the Czech Republic * Czech Canadian * Canada\u2013European Union relations * Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement ==Notes== == External links == * Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade about relations with the Czech Republic * Canadian embassy Prague * Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic * Embassy of the Czech Republic in Ottawa * Consulate General of the Czech Republic in Toronto Czech Republic Category:Bilateral relations of the Czech Republic ",
