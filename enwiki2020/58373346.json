The major problem is the lack of awareness among common car buyers about the advantages of EVs over the combustion engine vehicles. The shortfall of electricity and lack of charging infrastructure are the major reasons why electric vehicles aren't considered by the public. Charging time required by the electric vehicles and the driving range that they offer are considered to be the negative factors that discourage the local consumers from buying EVs. Also given the amount of load shedding in Pakistan because of WAPDA\u2019s massive circular debt due to which home and electric charging stations might not receive uninterrupted supplies of electricity. It is usually questioned whether Pakistan's electricity power generation capacity will be able to cater to increased demand from electric vehicles in the future. ==Initiatives by Government of Pakistan== The Automotive Development Policy 2016\u20132021 and the launch of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have been encouraging foreign investments for the new automobile brands to enter Pakistani market.

According to policy, 100,000 cars and 500,000 bikes and rickshaws will be converted to EVs in next 4 years, and more than 3,000 CNG stations that have been shut due to gas shortage will be converted to EV charging stations.
