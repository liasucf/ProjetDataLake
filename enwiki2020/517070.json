    "text": "The 1886 Quebec general election on October 14, 1886 to elect members of the 6th Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Parti National, a broad coalition formed and led by Honor\u00e9 Mercier, that included the Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec and nationalist defectors from the Conservative party. The Parti national got a large boost when Liberals and dissident Conservatives rallied in reaction to the hanging of Louis Riel in 1885, for which the federal Conservatives were held responsible by Quebec voters. The nationalists won a majority of seats against the Parti conservateur du Qu\u00e9bec, led by John Jones Ross. The Conservatives hung on in a minority government until Mercier became premier on January 27, 1887. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1881 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Honor\u00e9 Mercier |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|15 !align=\"right\"|33 |align=\"right\"|+120% |align=\"right\"|58 389 |align=\"right\"| 39.54% |align=\"right\"|+0.6% |Conservative | John Jones Ross |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 49 !align=\"right\"| 26 |align=\"right\"| -46.9% |align=\"right\"|68 141 |align=\"right\"| 46.19% |align=\"right\"| -4.2% |colspan=2|Independent Conservative |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|1 !align=\"right\"|3 |align=\"right\"|+200% |rowspan=3 align=\"right\"|20 994 |rowspan=3 align=\"right\"| 14.23% |rowspan=3 align=\"right\"|+3.2% |Parti national | Honor\u00e9 Mercier |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|3 |align=\"right\"|- |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|65 !align=\"right\"|65 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==Footnotes== ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 6th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
