Prahok (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780) is a crushed, salted and fermented fish paste (usually of mudfish) that is used in Cambodian cuisine as a seasoning or a condiment. It originated as a way of preserving fish during the months when fresh fish was not available in abundant supply. Because of its saltiness and strong flavor, it was used as an addition to many meals in Cambodian cuisine, such as soups and sauces. A Cambodian saying goes, \"No prahok, no salt\", referring to a dish that is of poor flavor or bland thus highlighting its essentiality in Cambodian cuisine. Prahok has a strong and distinct smell, earning the nickname \"Cambodian cheese\" among food writers.Star Chefs Five main Cambodian ingredients Accessed July 21, 2007 Prahok is usually eaten as a main course with white rice and vegetable such as yardlong bean, cucumbers, and Thai eggplant.

It can be eaten cooked or fried, but is usually not eaten raw because of health issues (raw Prahok cannot be stored long due to spoilage if not consumed in a short period) and the unpleasant smell it makes. ==Varieties and production== Prahok is made with various fish and methods of fermentation. Fish used include mudfish (Channa spp.) and moonlight gourami (Trichogaster microlepis). One noted variety made with a gourami species is called Prahok Kanthara and is attributed to a Laotian style of preparation. Prahok is obtained by crushing or grinding fresh fish after de-scaling, gutting and cleaning them. They can be crushed underfoot, like wine grapes, or processed by machine. After the fish is crushed, it is left in the sun for a full day, then salted. The prahok is fermented in large clay jars covered with a lid made of woven bamboo strips.
