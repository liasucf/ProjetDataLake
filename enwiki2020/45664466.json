Urban wrote: \"Superbly made in every respect, In the Winter Dark is as tough as the Australian bush on one hand, yet as sensitive as a pregnant girl on the other; a rich if puzzling film that introduces Bogle as a fascinating new filmmaking talent.\"Urban Cinefile In the Winter Dark. Retrieved 14 March 2015. David Stratton wrote: \"Bogle\u2019s handsomely produced film is completely successful in exploring a mysterious, threatening environment peopled by a quartet of seriously disturbed characters. Comparisons can be made to Samantha Lang\u2019s 1997 \u201cThe Well,\u201d a similarly bleak tale of psychological frissons, and those who were unable to tune into the Lang film will probably have similar problems with Bogle\u2019s chiller.\" Cinephilia wrote that \"given that this was shot in under 6 weeks and helmed by a director on his first major feature this is an impressive effort even if its potential is not fully realized.\"Cinephilia In The Winter Dark. Retrieved 14 March 2015. Paula Nechak wrote: \"In the Winter Dark is too internalized and segregated to rate as a successful film. Because we see from Maurice's eye and through his mental state of being it's near impossible to find the perspective (or the compassion and empathy) that would allow us access to the other characters.\" Film Threat wrote: \"The story is unstructured at times and leaves numerous plot elements unexplained. Martin McGrath\u2019s cinematography of rural Australia is phenomenal and complements Bogle\u2019s directing to create this harrowing portrayal of the dark side of human madness.\"Film Threat In the Winter Dark.
