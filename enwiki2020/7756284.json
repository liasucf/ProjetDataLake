It was situated south of Wrangbrook Junction, just inside what became the South Yorkshire boundary and was intended to serve the hamlet of Pickburn, which was close by, and Brodsworth, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, a short distance away. The station was similar to that at Sprotborough and controlled by a signal box which was replaced in 1910 when the opening of Brodsworth Colliery necessitated a larger installation. A short branch was built to access the colliery from this point. == References == \"Railways of South Yorkshire\", C.T. Goode, Dalesman Publications.
