    "text": "The 2006 Canadian Football League season is considered to be the 53rd season in modern-day Canadian football, although it is officially the 49th Canadian Football League season. ==CFL News in 2006== It was announced on April 9, 2006 that the CFL had suspended the operations of the Ottawa Renegades for the 2006 season, thus making the CFL an 8 team league and moving the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to the East Division for at least the 2006 season. On April 12, 2006 an Ottawa Dispersal Draft was held where the remaining 8 teams chose players from the Ottawa Renegades' roster. On September 28, it was confirmed that Ottawa would return no sooner than the 2008 season, to give potential new owners enough time to set up the new franchise. Ultimately, the Renegades never returned. They would not be replaced until the formation of the Ottawa Redblacks, who began play for the 2014 CFL season. The 2006 season is the first season where teams will be able to challenge officials' calls using instant replay. The CFL's replay system seems to be largely modelled on the one used in the NFL although there are some differences. A new salary cap and salary management system (SMS) was adopted for the 2006 season, although the enforcement part of the new system will not take effect until the 2007 season. The cap for the 2007 season has been set at $4.05 million. It was announced on July 5, 2006 that Tom Wright, commissioner of the CFL, had informed the CFL that he would not be seeking a contract extension as league commissioner after this season, thus ending his tenure as the 11th CFL commissioner. Prior to his final day in the office, Wright presented the Grey Cup to the BC Lions as they defeated the Montreal Alouettes in the championship game at Winnipeg's Canad Inns Stadium. Commissioner Wright and TSN President Phil King announced a landmark five-year multi-platform agreement between the League and TSN to commence in 2008 on December 20. On October 26, 2006 Hugh Campbell stepped down as CEO of the Eskimos. The number of TDs scored on kicking or punting plays dropped dramatically in 2006, which many attributed to stricter rules on blocking. There were 16 such TDs in 2005, and just 3 in the 2006 season. ===Records and Milestones=== Damon Allen became pro-football's all-time passing yardage leader on September 4 by surpassing Warren Moon's total of 70,553 yards (in both the CFL and NFL combined) as the Toronto Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 40\u20136. Terry Vaughn became the all-time receptions leader, surpassing Darren Flutie with 973 on July 14. Then on September 22, Vaughn became the first football receiver in CFL history to record 1,000 all-time receptions. On October 14, Byron Parker sets a new CFL single-season record for most interception return yardage with 342 on a 75-yard interception return for a touchdown in Edmonton. On October 20, Mike O'Shea becomes the first Canadian and third player (behind Willie Pless and Alondra Johnson) to have had 1,000 career tackles. The Edmonton Eskimos' streak of 34 straight years in the playoffs came to an end in 2006. ==Regular season== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PF = Points For, PA = Points Against, Pts = Points Teams in bold' finished in playoff positions. ===Notes=== * Ottawa Renegades have suspended operations for the 2006 season. ==Grey Cup playoffs== The BC Lions are the 2006 Grey Cup Champions, defeating the Montreal Alouettes 25\u201314 at Winnipeg's Canad Inns Stadium. It was the first Grey Cup for the Lions since they defeated the same Alouettes in the 88th Grey Cup game in 2000. The Lions' Dave Dickenson (QB) was named the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player and the Lions' Paul McCallum (K) was the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian. ===Playoff bracket=== ==CFL Leaders== * CFL
