    "text": "Mirabella was a women's magazine published from June 1989 to April 2000. It was created by and named for Grace Mirabella, a former Vogue editor in chief, in partnership with Rupert Murdoch. It was originally published by News Corporation, and it became the property of Hachette Filipacchi in 1995. Known as a smart women's magazine, it suffered in comparison to Elle, a more lighthearted issue from the same publisher. Declining ad revenue contributed to a reported $9 million loss in 1999, and the magazine folded immediately after the debut of Oprah Winfrey's magazine O in April 2000. Mirabella's circulation stood at 558,009 at the time of its demise. ==Editors== *Amy Gross (1989-1993, 1995-1997) *Gay Bryant (1993-1995) *Dominique Browning (1995) *Roberta Myers (1997-2000) ==Cultural references== In the Family Guy episode \"Fore, Father\", Stewie Griffin picks up the December issue of Mirabella in the doctor's waiting room.

Cregg is irritated that the reporter from Mirabella is asking about food & wine in her press briefings.
