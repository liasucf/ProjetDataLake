Three more women were elected in by-elections held following the general election: Jean Casselman Wadds in September 1958, Judy LaMarsh in October 1960, and Margaret Mary Macdonald in May 1961. Two additional women: Olive Lillian Irvine and Josie Alice Quart were named to the Canadian senate in January 1960. Cairine Wilson died in March 1962, which brought the number of women senators to six. == Party Standings == {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" width=\"610\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" class=\"sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !Party !Total women candidates !% women candidates of total candidates !Total women elected !% women elected of total women candidates !% women elected of total elected |- |Liberal | (of 264) |3.0% | (of 48) |0% |0% |- |Co-operative Commonwealth Federation | (of 169) |4.7% | (of 8) |0% |0% |- |Progressive Conservative | (of 265) |1.1% | (of 208) |66.7% |1.8% |- |Social Credit | (of 82) |2.4% | (of 0) |0% | - |-class=\"sortbottom\" |colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"|Table source: |} == Members of the House of Commons == {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" width=\"610\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" width=\"100%\" class=\"sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" ! !Name !Party !Electoral district !Notes |- | Margaret Aitken | Progressive Conservative | York\u2014Humber | |- | Ellen Fairclough | Progressive Conservative | Hamilton West | cabinet member |- | Judy LaMarsh | Liberal | Niagara Falls | by-election |- | Margaret Mary Macdonald | Progressive Conservative | King's | by-election, first woman MP from PEI |- | Jean Casselman Wadds | Progressive Conservative | Grenville\u2014Dundas | by-election |} ==Senators== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! !Senator !Appointed on the advice of !Term !from !Party |- |Cairine Wilson |King ||1930.02.15 - 1962.03.03 |Ontario |Liberal |- |Muriel McQueen Fergusson |St. Laurent |1953.05.19 - 1975.05.23 |New Brunswick |Liberal |- |Marianna Beauchamp Jodoin |St. Laurent |1953.05.19 - 1966.06.01 |Quebec |Liberal |- |Nancy Hodges |St. Laurent |1953.11.05 - 1965.06.12 |British Columbia |Liberal |- |Florence Elsie Inman |St. Laurent |1955.07.28 - 1986.05.31 |Prince Edward Island |Liberal |- |Olive Lillian Irvine |Diefenbaker |1960.01.14 - 1969.11.01 |Manitoba |Progressive Conservative |- |Josie Alice Quart |Diefenbaker |1960.01.14 - 1969.11.01 |Quebec |Progressive Conservative |} == References == * Category:Lists of female political office- holders in Canada ",
