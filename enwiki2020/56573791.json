The series stars Nathan Fillion, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T. Jones, Titus Makin Jr., Mercedes Mason, Melissa O'Neil, Afton Williamson, Mekia Cox and Eric Winter. The Rookie premiered on October 16, 2018. The first season ran until April 16, 2019. The second season ran from September 29, 2019, to May 10, 2020. In May 2020, ABC renewed the series for a third season. ==Premise== The series follows John Nolan, a forty-five-year-old newly divorced man from Pennsylvania, former owner of a construction company and father of a son in college, who, after inadvertently helping police officers during a bank robbery, moves to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). After graduating from the Police Academy as the oldest rookie on the force, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, unpredictable nature of his job and is determined to make it in his new career despite the challenges. Series lead Nathan Fillion stated during an interview that the drama was inspired by a true story as the LAPD is one of just two agencies that accepts new officers over the age of 37. The man whose story inspired the premise of the show was later revealed to be Bill Norcross, who continues to serve in the LAPD and also as executive producer on The Rookie. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Nathan Fillion as John Nolan: The oldest rookie (Police Officer I) at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), he is assigned to the Wilshire Division. He studied law at Pennsylvania State University but dropped out upon learning his former girlfriend Sarah was pregnant and went into construction. At the age of 45, Nolan closed his construction company in Pennsylvania and moved out west to become a police officer. He is divorced with a 19-year-old son, Henry, who is a freshman in college. * Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez: An LAPD training officer (Police Officer III) on the cusp of making detective-trainee, a situation which is threatened when West is assigned to her. Although she gives West a hard time, Lopez also looks out for him. She is engaged to defense attorney Wesley Evers. * Richard T. Jones as Wade Grey: A sergeant (Sergeant II) and a watch commander of the Wilshire Station.

Grey served in the United States Army prior to joining the LAPD. He has a daughter who is planning to go to college in the fall. * Titus Makin Jr. as Jackson West: An eager rookie officer (Police Officer I) and the son of Commander West, head of the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division.

She does not return for the second season, as she has moved on to U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) rather than face a possibly stalled career in the LAPD. * Eric Winter as Tim Bradford: An overbearing training officer (Police Officer III). He is assigned Chen as a rookie and gives her a hard time. He used to be a squad leader and served in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the LAPD.

Jones as Sergeant Wade Grey, Titus Makin as Jackson West, Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez, and Mercedes Mason as Captain Zoe Andersen.

While the outlet initially claimed that the split was amicable, Williamson, in a lengthy Instagram post, stated that she had left the series due to having \"experienced racial discrimination/racially charged inappropriate comments from the hair department.\" Williamson also alleged that she was sexually harassed by a guest star, who was later identified as Demetrius Grosse, who portrays Kevin Wolfe in a recurring role, as well as an incident of bullying that escalated into sexual assault at a party; the head of the hair department was later identified as Sallie Ciganovich. Williamson claimed that she had gone to the showrunners multiple times with these allegations, but was ignored. Everyone involved in the allegations denied them. An investigation was commissioned through the law firm Mitchell Sillerberg and Knupp along with a third-party firm EXTTI, who conducted nearly 400 hours of interviews and examined video and other evidence. The results of the investigation were published on September 17, 2019, which found that the allegations made by Williamson had no merit, and could not be proven.
