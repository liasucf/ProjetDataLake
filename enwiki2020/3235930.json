    "text": "The AMT Hardballer is a series of pistols that are a clone of the .45 ACP Colt M1911 made by Arcadia Machine & Tool (AMT) from 1977 to 2002. The Hardballer was the first entirely stainless steel 1911 pattern pistol. Other features included adjustable rear sights and a lengthened grip safety. ==Overview== The Hardballer derives its name from round-nose hardball G.I. ammunition (solid 230 grain Full Metal Jacketed bullets). This is the round the pistol was designed to shoot. The Hardballer series of pistols all share a brushed stainless steel finish and a wide target style trigger with adjustable trigger stop. The later Galena-made pistols have an elongated \"beavertail\" grip safety and a beveled magazine well. ==Variants== * AMT Hardballer: an all stainless steel version of the Colt Gold Cup, fitted with Micro rear sights. * AMT Combat Government: was developed as a sports pistol but in 1978 AMT marketed the Combat Government, an M1911 clone with fixed sights for police departments. Since 1985, this model has been called the Government with the term \"Combat\" omitted. * AMT Longslide: a version with an extended barrel, introduced in 1980. It has the same qualities as the Hardballer but with slide and barrel lengthened by . * AMT Skipper: a compact version of the Hardballer introduced in 1980. It features a barrel. In 1984, the Skipper disappeared from AMT's range. * AMT Commando: originally offered by AMT then improved and reintroduced in 2000 (this date in question) under the Galena Industries brand. The original AMT Commando was a barreled version and did not have a loaded chamber indicator nor beavertail grip safety. The improved Commando is a compact model of the Government with a barrel but retaining the frame of the Government model. It is chambered in .40 S&W; and has an 8-round magazine capacity. * AMT Accelerator: a Galena-made Longslide chambered for the .400 Corbon cartridge featuring a barrel and an elongated beavertail. * AMT Javelina: a Longslide variant chambered in the 10mm Auto caliber with an 8-round capacity magazine. ==In popular culture== The Longslide version was the pistol used by Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in the 1984 film, The Terminator. The pistol used by Schwazenegger also comes with a laser sight. In the Hitman video game series, custom AMT Hardballers (called \"Silverballers\" from Hitman: Contracts onwards), singular and dual, are Agent 47's signature weapons. In the movie The Phantom, Billy Zane portrays a mysterious hero who is armed with two matching AMT Hardballer Longslide .45s in this 1996 cult classic. In the video game killer7 KAEDE Smith uses a scoped Hardballer. In the video game Resident Evil 4, the AMT Longslide makes an appearance, named the Killer 7. It is the second \"Magnum\" type pistol obtainable in the game. In Lee Child's Jack Reacher book Bad Luck and Trouble, AMT Hardballers are the weapons used by two drug dealers in an ill-advised attempt to recoup $900 stolen from them by Reacher. In the anime Black Lagoon, Mr. Chang wields dual custom AMT Hardballer Longslides. ==References== ==External links== * Ian's AMT Information site Category:.45 ACP semi- automatic pistols Category:1911 platform Category:AMT semi-automatic pistols Category:Short recoil firearms Category:Semi-automatic pistols of the United States ",
