She is the CEO of Bright Little Labs, an education company that makes educational gender-neutral toys and materials. == Early life == Deen attended Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls from 1989 until 1999 leaving after GCSEs. She received a bachelor's degree in Law at the University of Sheffield in 2005, before completing a Legal Practise Course at The College of Law. == Career == Deen worked as a lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, before joining SamKnows. Deen realised she wanted to work with children, and became a school counsellor with Place2Be. She worked for Code Club, where she helped to introduce the new coding curriculum for the United Kingdom with Google and the Department for Education. In 2014 Deen was appointed head of Code Club Pro, which ran training sessions for teachers. At Code Club Deen recognised a large group of young people who could not engage. In 2015 Deen founded Bright Little Labs, who use 'edutaining' stories to get children to learn to code. Following a survey of over 1,000 people, Deen found the negative stereotypes in technology are reflected in children's cartoons \u2013 and so Bright Little Labs created Detective Dot. In an interview with The Guardian, she said that \"by age eight, children think that some things are for boys, some things are for girls \u2013 from toys to future careers\". Her research revealed that \"In kids\u2019 cartoons under three per cent of characters are black,\". The project raised \u00a314,500 on Kickstarter. It has since reach over 30 countries worldwide. Deen was voted Computer Weekly\u2019s Rising Star at Women in IT 2015. Bright Little Labs was selected by HundrED as one of the most innovative practises in education in the world. Detective Dot works for the Children's Intelligence Agency (CIA), and invites readers to \"become agents, go on missions and do investigations,\". Dot's challenges are inspired by citizen science and help young people to engage with data in a real-world way. Bright Little Labs are working with educators, illustrators and writers to create stories and content linked to the computer science curriculum. In 2017 it was listed by The Independent as one of the \"10 best coding toys\". Deen is the CEO of Bright Little Labs, which became part of Bethnal Green Ventures in 2016. Deen was listed in the BIMA Top 100 Awards for the digital industry's brightest stars in 2016 and 2017. Bright Little Labs won the EDF Energy \"Pulse Award\". In 2017 she delivered a TEDx talk at Goodenough College, \"The robot revolution \u2013 a survival guide for kids\". She won the 2017 FDM Group Start-up Founder of the Year Award. She was listed in the Computer Weekly Top 50 Most Influential Women in Tech shortlist in 2018 and 2019 ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:English women novelists Category:English children's writers Category:Writers from London Category:People educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls ",
