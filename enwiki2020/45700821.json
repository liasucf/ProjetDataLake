The antemedial line is greyish brown and punctuate and the postmedial line is brown and punctuate. The discal spot and mid-cell spot are greyish brown, and there is a white strip ringed with brown, as well as two big round greyish-brown patches near the lower angle of the cell, each with a dark brown ovate spot inside.
