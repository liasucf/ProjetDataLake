Soon there after the village of Brusio was settled on the valley floor below the monastery. The monastery influenced this early stage of settlement and growth in the village. By 1212 it was an independent municipality with its own dean or senior pastor who represented the municipality's interests. In the 13th Century, the entire Val Poschiavo became part of the fief of the Bishop of Chur. During the 14th Century, Brusio was part of the practically (but not officially) independent municipality of Poschiavo.
