The headquarters of the magazine was in East Berlin. Its target audience was professional designers and those who were interested in design. The magazine covered articles on design-related topics. It reflected official preference of the state over the development of form and design in the country. For instance, the magazine reinforced the use of plastic goods in line with the policies of the state. One of the editors-in- chief of Form und Zweck was Hein K\u00f6ster, who was fired from the post in 1983 following his article about a fictitious museum in Prenzlauerberg.
