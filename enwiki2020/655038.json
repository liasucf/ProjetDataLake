The First Fleet is the name given to the group of eleven ships carrying convicts, the first to do so, that left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. The ships departed with an estimated 775 convicts (582 men and 193 women), as well as officers, marines, their wives and children, and provisions and agricultural implements. After 43 convicts had died during the eight-month trip, 732 landed at Sydney Cove. In 2005, the First Fleet Garden, a memorial to the First Fleet immigrants, friends and others was created on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. Stonemason Ray Collins researched and then carved the names of all those who came out to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden. No single definitive list of people who travelled on those ships exists; however, historians have pieced together as much data about these pioneers as possible. In the late 1980s, a simple software program with a database of convicts became available for Australian school students, both as a history and an information technology learning guide. An on-line version is now hosted by the University of Wollongong. Digitised images of the lists from the Orders in Council for the First Fleet are available on the Convict Indents Index. The six ships that transported the First Fleet convicts were: * Alexander * Charlotte * Friendship * Lady Penrhyn * Prince of Wales * Scarborough ==List of Convicts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width=1024px;\" ! style=\"width: 13%;\" | Name ! style=\"width: 10%;\" | Date of birth ! style=\"width: 10%;\" | Place of conviction ! style=\"width: 10%;\" | Date of conviction ! style=\"width: 7%;\" | Sentence ! style=\"width: 40%;\" | Other information ! style=\"width: 10%;\" | Transport ship |- |data-sort-value=\"Bails, Robert\"| Robert Bails | c. 1766 | Reading | 28 February 1785 | Death commuted to 14 | For more information see here | Alexander |- |data-sort-value=\"Baker, Martha\"| Martha Baker | c. 1762 | London | 30 August 1786 | 7 | For more information see here | Lady Penrhyn |- |data-sort-value=\"Baker, Thomas\"| Thomas Baker | c. 1764 | Exeter | 10 January 1786 | 7 | Baker was convicted at Exeter for an unrecorded crime which resulted in him receiving 7 years transportation.

Barrett was a ringleader in the Mercury Mutiny in April 1784. He was recaptured and sentenced to death, but since he had intervened to save the steward's life and prevented injury to the Captain, he was reprieved and given transportation for life. On the voyage to New South Wales, Barrett was involved in passing counterfeit coin made from some pewter spoons and old buttons and buckles belonging to marines at Rio de Janeiro. John White asked Barrett to make a memento of the trip, and Barrett fashioned a medal out of a silver kidney dish. The Charlotte Medal (the first work of Australian Colonial art) was sold at auction to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2008 for one million dollars. In February 1788 Barrett was hanged for stealing beef and peas. He was the first man executed by hanging in New South Wales. |Charlotte |- |data- sort-value=\"Barry, John\"| John Barry | c. 1768 |Bristol |23 November 1785 |7 |About 17-18 yrs old when convicted. |Friendship |- |data-sort-value=\"Barsby, George\"| George Barsby | |Winchester |1 March 1785 |Death commuted to life | |Scarborough |- |data-sort-value=\"Barsby, Samuel\"| Samuel Barsby | c. 1764 |Exeter |20 March 1786 |Death commuted to 7 | |Charlotte |- |data-sort- value=\"Bartlett, James\"| James Bartlett | |Winchester |1 March 1785 |7 |Pardoned & released before 1st fleet departed | |- |data-sort-value=\"Basely, John\"| John Basely | | | | | |Charlotte |- |data-sort-value=\"Bason, Elizabeth\"| Elizabeth Bason | c. 1757 |Salisbury |24 July 1784 |Death commuted to 7 |Became wife of James Heatherly, crew of Sirius |Charlotte |- |data-sort- value=\"Batley, Oten\"| Oten Batley | |Exeter | |7 | |Charlotte |- |data-sort- value=\"Batley, Walter\"| Walter Batley | c. 1760 |London |29 October 1783 |7 |aka Walton.
