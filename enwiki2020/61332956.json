    "text": "Pineapple syrup is a kind of syrup sometimes used in fruity tropical drinks. It can be made by combining water and sugar, and leaving pineapple cubes in that mixture and squeezing pineapple juice out of them into the mixture. Another way is to mix aloe water with cane sugar and pineapple juice and simmer that mixture until the sugar is dissolved; this can then be used in, e.g., a cucumber cooler. Another way is to cut a pineapple into chunks, coat the chunks with sugar, and leave in a bowl in a refrigerator overnight; and then to combine this in a blender with a 2:1 simple syrup, and preserve with vodka or white rum. Some cocktails that use pineapple syrup include the altazor, honeymusk, six figures, habibi, and Primm's Plantation. ==References== Category:Pineapples Category:Syrup ",
