This result meant that Pratibha Patil became the first female President of India. ==Candidates == ===Official candidates=== File:Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.jpg| File:Pratibha Patil 2012-02-27.jpg| On 14 June, Pratibha Patil, the governor of the state of Rajasthan, was declared by UPA as its candidate for the election. The Left and other allies of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) such as Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) announced their support on Patil's candidature. Shiv Sena, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also supported Patil's candidature. The move came as a surprise as Patil's name was not mentioned among the probables by UPA so far. Supported unofficially by the NDA, the then Vice President, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat filed his nomination as an independent candidate on 25 June 2007. ===Potential candidates=== File:A. P. J.

Initially Shivraj Patil and Pranab Mukherjee (both sitting cabinet ministers) emerged as the frontrunners for the candidature. Other names which did the rounds in the UPA camp include Sushil Kumar Shinde and Karan Singh. Pranab Mukherjee was stated to be too critical at his current responsibility to stand for the presidential elections and the Left parties opposed the candidature of Shivaraj Patil, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Karan Singh. On the other hand, the NDA stated that it would support Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in case he decides to contest as an independent candidate. Other probables such as N.R. Narayana Murthy who received significant media hype did not appear to have gathered any support from any of the sides. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a former prime minister who would have been NDA's probable candidate denied his desire to become the next president.I have no desire to be the President: Vajpayee On 18 June, a set of parties with allegiance neither to UPA or NDA\u2014All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Samajwadi Party (SP)\u2014formed an alliance called the United National Progressive Alliance and announced their support for a second term for the incumbent, Abdul Kalam.http://www.ibnlive.com/news/politics/06_2007/patil-a-joke-played-by- sonia-kalam-is-best-third-front-43132.html On 20 June a delegation of United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) met Dr. Kalam with a request to contest the presidential elections, to which he replied that he is willing to contest only if there is a certainty of winning and that he is willing to wait for a few days for this certainty.Kalam surprises Third Front by his changed stance However, he soon announced he would not run. On 14 July 2007, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly (Leader of Opposition) J. Jayalalitha announced that the UNPA unanimously decided to abstain from the presidential polls. However, the Election Commission of India held that the UNPA cannot ask its legislators to abstain from voting, quoting Section 171 C of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). ==Process== As per the electoral calculation following were the number of votes for respective political parties.
