The Tibetan Colony has a Tibetan handicraft center, a Tibetan Children's Village school (Suja), and a branch of the Tibetan Medical and Astrological Institute (Men- Tsee-Khang), as well as a medical clinic. The Deer Park Institute is in Bir's Tibetan Colony, as is also a number of restaurants, shops, caf\u00e9s, and guest houses. ==Geography== Bir Tibetan Colony is located in the western half of the village of Chowgan, on the southwestern edge of the town of Bir, in the Tehsil (administrative subdivision) of Baijnath, in the District of Kangra, in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Bir Tibetan Colony is located east-southeast of Dharamshala and is three hours by bus from Dharamshala. It is situated 6 km south of the popular paragliding destination of billing, on the way to the Thamsar Pass leading to Bara Bhangal. Geologically, Bir is situated in the Dhauladhar Range of the foothills of the Indian Himalayas. The nearest railway station is Ahju, on the narrow-gauge line running between Pathankot and Jogindernagar via Kangra. Road access to Bir Tibetan Colony is from the Bir Road turnoff (signposted) on NH20, approximately midway between Baijnath and Jogindernagar. Detailed travel tips for Bir are available at the Bir Portal. ==Population== The population of Bir Tibetan Colony is primarily Tibetan refugees, but there are also a number of Indian families and a small community of international expatriates and long-term visitors. Note that it is only the Bir Tibetan Colony itself that is primarily settled by Tibetan refugees: the population of the town of Bir proper is almost entirely Indian. The majority of the Tibetan refugees based in Bir originally came from the Kham region of southeastern Tibet, but many of the refugees living in the Colony today were born in India, and the population continues to diversify. == Institutions and attractions == 280x280px There are several institutions in Bir that attract tourists, students, volunteers and other visitors from around India and from abroad: A branch of Palyul Monastery of the Nyingma school's Penor Rinpoche was established in Bir Tibetan Colony, and Rigo Tulku Rinpoche is its Khenpo.
