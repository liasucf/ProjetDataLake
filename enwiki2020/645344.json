    "text": "The Major Transitions in Evolution is a book written by John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry (Oxford University Press, 1995). Also At the time of its publication, Egbert Giles Leigh, Jr reviewing for Evolution commented that it \"may be the most important book on evolution since R.A. Fisher's (1930) The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\". Maynard Smith and Szathmary authored a review article in Nature. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" style=\"font- size:100%\" |- ! colspan=\"3\" | Transitions described in the book |- !

As stated by the authors, this book was aimed at professional biologists and assumes considerable prior knowledge. They have also published a presentation of their ideas for a general readership under the title The Origins of Life \u2014 From the Birth of Life to the Origins of Language. ==See also== *Evolutionary history of life *Metasystem transition, a related notion developed by Valentin Turchin in 1977. *Origin of life *Social evolution ==References== Category:Books about evolution Category:1995 non- fiction books Category:Modern synthesis (20th century) Category:Oxford University Press books Category:Superorganisms ",
