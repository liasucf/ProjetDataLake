Ch\u0101qu\u00e1n falls under the classification Ch\u00e1ngqu\u00e1n (literally \"long fist\"), a general term for external Northern Chinese martial arts, which are known for their extended, long movements. The style is associated with the Hui people and related to the Turkic people from Central Asia. In the legend, a Turkic warrior named \"Zha Mi-Er\" (maybe Sameer; ) from current Xinjiang or Central Asia passed down this martial art to the Chinese locals in the current Xandong province during the late Ming dynasty. One famous master of Chaquan was the famous Wang Zi-Ping (), who was known for his great strength. Other famous modern day masters include Zhang Wenguang, Ma Jinbiao, and Liu Hongchi. Ch\u0101qu\u00e1n is one of the sources of the contemporary w\u01d4sh\u00f9 Ch\u00e1ngqu\u00e1n often seen in movies and tournaments. Chaquan is a system that has 6 main weapons (staff, saber, sword, spear, kwandao, hookswords). It emphasizes long range movements and stances combined with speed and power. The style includes many forms, including 10 lines of tantui for basic power training, 10 longer sets of chaquan, and other forms as well. ==References== ==Further reading== * Wu Bin, Li Xingdong e Yu Gongbao, Essentials of Chinese Wushu, Foreign languages press, Beijing, 1992, * Carmona Jos\u00e9, De Shaolin \u00e0 Wudang, les arts martiaux chinois, Gui Trenadiel editeur. ==External links== *Kung fu Montreal, traditional chinese martial arts - Northern Shaolin / Chaquan Category:Chinese martial arts Category:Wushu (sport) ",
