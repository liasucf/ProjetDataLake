    "text": "Serenity Knolls is an album by guitarists Bill Brovold and Jamie Saft released on the RareNoise label in 2017.RareNoise Records album details, accessed February 22, 2018 ==Reception== On All About Jazz, Dan Bilawsky called it\"an album of front porch twang-and-strum, evoking peacefulness on the prairies and offering one American idyll after another\" noting \"Bill Brovold and Jamie Saft have managed to capture the heart, spirit, and sound of a country day in their duo explorations. Heartland, hearth, and home sweet home are well-represented on Serenity Knolls\".Bilawsky, D., All About Jazz Review , March 14, 2017 Chronogram's James Keepnews wrote \"Although Kingston-based Rasta polymath Jamie Saft is best known as an accomplished keyboardist and studio maven, his recorded work as a guitarist dates as far back as two decades ... His dobro and lap steel skills get a rare, ample, and ravishing workout on this new collaboration with his fellow local multi-instrumentalist, guitarist Bill Brovold. The album title references the rehab center where Jerry Garcia died, striking a fitting balance for these 12 often stark tone poems\u2014some warm and serene, others as dark and searching as the emotions upon the loss of a loved one. Much of the darkness comes from Brovold's chimes-at-midnight, dirge-y chordal atmospheres enveloping Saft's adept, pealing slide chorales\".Keepnews, J.
