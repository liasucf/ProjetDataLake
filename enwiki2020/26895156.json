Juan Bautista V\u00e1zquez el Viejo (1510 in Pelayos, province of Salamanca Castile and Leon \u2013 12 June 1588 in Llerena, province of Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain) was a Spanish sculptor. == Biography == Born in Pelayos (province of Salamanca), as a small child he moved with his family to \u00c1vila, where the lived adjacent to the main market square. He first learned his art there in the studio of Vasco de la Zarza. It is believed that he then went to Italy, where his style became more elegant. In 1554 he moved to Toledo, where he executed various works for the Cathedral, the church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca, and the church of Almonacid de Zorita (province of Guadalajara), among others. In 1558, Francisca Bl\u00e1zquez, widow of sculptor Isidro de Villoldo, brought him back to \u00c1vila to complete the figures of the main altarpiece of the Charterhouse of Seville, which Villodo had left unfinished at his death. In 1561 he moved to Seville to complete the altarpiece. He settled there, putting together an important studio with collaborators including his brother-in-law and carver Juan de Oviedo the Elder, Miguel de Ad\u00e1n, Gaspar del \u00c1guila, and Jer\u00f3nimo Hern\u00e1ndez. This studio would play a major role in establishing and consolidating the Sevillian school of sculpture. They made major contributions to the second phase of the main altarpiece of the Cathedral of Seville, as well as the Church of Saint Mary in Carmona (1563), the Church of Saint Matthew in Lucena (1572), the Church of Saint Mary in Medina Sidonia (1575); he also sculpted the Virgin of the Fevers () in Seville's Church of Saint Mary Magdalene. He married three times: to Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez, sister of Juan de Oviedo the Elder; to Mar\u00eda de Bonilla, daughter of the Sevillian painter Juan de Zamora; and to Isabel de Vald\u00e9s. He died in Llerena (province of Badajoz). His work was continued by his son Juan Bautista V\u00e1zquez the Younger. == References == * Jane Turner (Editor).
