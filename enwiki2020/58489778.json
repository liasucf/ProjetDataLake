He began working as an interpreter at the British Legation in Bangkok in 1896, and became the British Consul-General in Chiang Mai in 1921. He retired from office in 1931, and later took up teaching English in Chiang Mai, where he permanently settled down. He was a well known figure in the expatriate British community, and wrote several books, including Consul in Paradise (1965), a memoir covering his life in Thailand, and A History of Siam (1926), which was regarded as a standard work of the time. ==Works== * * ==References== Category:British diplomats Category:British expatriates in Thailand Category:Diplomats from Liverpool Category:People from Chiang Mai Province Category:1878 births Category:1970 deaths ",
