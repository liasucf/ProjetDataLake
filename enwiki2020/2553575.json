The name means \"parliament jetty\" or \"parliament point\" in Faroese. The parliament met there for the first time in the Viking ages when Norwegian colonists placed their Ting (parliament) on the location in 825. It is one of the oldest parliamentary meeting places in the world, along with Tynwald hill on the Isle of Man and \u00deingvellir in Iceland. The L\u00f8gting has since moved to the north of the city, but the home-rule government still sits here.

The small main street on the peninsula is called Gongin and is home to the oldest parts of the city. Many of the houses on Tinganes were built in the 16th and 17th centuries and are still in use today. The peninsula divides the T\u00f3rshavn harbour in two parts, Eystarav\u00e1g and Vesterav\u00e1g. ==External links== *tinganes.fo Category:T\u00f3rshavn Category:Thing (assembly) ",
