    "text": "K\u00fcsnachter Tobel (literally: K\u00fcsnacht gorge) is a small river canyon respective gorge on the southwestern slope of the Pfannenstiel mountain in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. K\u00fcsnachter Tobel and K\u00fcsnacht as seen from Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) ship MS Helvetia K\u00fcsnachter Tobel, K\u00fcsnacht and Z\u00fcrichsee as seen from Felsenegg upright some of the smaller glacial erratics Ortsmuseum K\u00fcsnacht, a former mill and now the museum of local history. == Geography == Located on the southwestern slope of the Pfannenstiel mountain chain, and originating nearby the locality Forch respectively historical mountain pass of the same name, the small Dorfbach stream flows in the Z\u00fcrichsee at the municipality of K\u00fcsnacht on Z\u00fcrich lakeshore, forming there a river delta and the peninsula on which K\u00fcsnacht was partially built. The stream formed in the past thousands of years an about long, but widely just about to wide canyon. == Attractions == The main attraction in the up to incised gorge is the wild, primeval landscape. Sometimes rock slides occur there, the last on 24 April 2013 when a boulder crashed on the pathway. Nevertheless, the pathway is very popular for hiking, usually starting in Forch and ending at the landing gate of the Z\u00fcrichsee lake transportation company Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) in K\u00fcsnacht. Points of interest include the so-called Drachenh\u00f6hle towards the Wulp Castle (built by the House of Regensberg) besides the gorge: The literally Dragon's Den is a small cave that was washed out of the glacial Nagelfluh conglomerate. The so-called Dorfbach stream is also one of the most important spawning grounds for lake trout, although the number of spawning animals was as of 2013 very modest. Some glacial erratics respectively the so-called Findlingsgarten at the lower end of the gorge towards K\u00fcsnacht, as well as the idyllic landscape, are further points of attraction. Towards K\u00fcsnacht there is the local historical museum and the historical core of K\u00fcsnacht. The museum is a former historical mill, located at the southern entrance of the ravine. The early medieval Zehntenhaus granary on the lake shore is another attraction to be mentioned. == Historical floods == Protagonist of the idyllic natural spectacle of the K\u00fcsnachter Tobel is the so-called K\u00fcsnachter Dorfbach, a small stream, but in earlier times very dangerous: The hypocritical rippling through the standardized streambed little water, emerged several times, so a document of 1678 mentions for the first time a major flood with human losses. And again in 1778, after massive rains, the villagers of K\u00fcsnacht\u2013Goldbach were caught sleeping, and 63 deaths and great damage to property occurred; after this disaster the natural, meandering stream course through the village was forced in a dead straight channel. Once more 100 years later, after heavy rains, the water accumulated at a too low-lying bridge and formed a breaking roller water, with high damage but without human losses. == Transportation == Forch is provided by the Forchbahn tram from Z\u00fcrich-Stadelhofen (Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz) or Esslingen, K\u00fcsnacht by the S-Bahn Z\u00fcrich lines S6 (ZVV) and S16 (ZVV), as well as by the autobus line 910 and the local bus transportation. In the summer there are about every 30 minutes regular boats from and to Z\u00fcrich as well as along the lake to Rapperswil, run by the Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG). == References == == External links == Category:Landforms of the canton of Z\u00fcrich Category:Valleys of Switzerland Category:River valleys of Switzerland Category:K\u00fcsnacht Category:Rivers of the canton of Z\u00fcrich Category:Rivers of Switzerland ",
