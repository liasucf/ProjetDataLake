    "text": "\"Take Me Back to Your House\" is a song recorded by English electronic music duo Basement Jaxx featuring Martina Sorbara. It was released as the second single from their fourth studio album Crazy Itch Radio by XL Recordings. It reached number 42 in the UK Singles Chart. ==Composition== The Independent described the track as an uptempo banjo house \"stomper\". \"Take Me Back To Your House\" is better still, a banjo-strewn folk-funk concoction which is surely destined to be remixed with a stomping house beat. ==Critical reception== The Independent called the track \"deliriously catchy.\" Robert Christgau chose the song as one of his favorite tracks from the album. ==Release== Ahead of their stadium tour in December 2006, the duo created a one night only residence at KOKO titled The Crazy Itch Club. ==Music video== The music video for the song was directed by Dougal Wilson. The video features Martina Sorbara and high stepping Cossacks and dancing bears. The Independent called the video \"remarkable.\" ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2005-2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\"|US Dance Singles Sales (Billboard) |15 |- |} == References == Category:2006 singles Category:2006 songs Category:Basement Jaxx songs Category:XL Recordings singles Category:Songs written by Martina Sorbara Category:Songs written by Felix Buxton Category:Songs written by Simon Ratcliffe (musician) ",
