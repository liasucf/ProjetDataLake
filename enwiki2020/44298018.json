Keith Coates-Palgrave \"Trees of Southern Africa\", edn 3, imp. 4. Random House Struik (Pty), Ltd, Cape Town. . pp 243, 244 == Description and Range == An evergreen, Trichocladus ellipticus ranges in size from a scrambling shrub to a small, many-branched tree to 10m, while the subspecies malosanus reaches up to 15m. It is native to South Africa, eastern Zimbabwe, and western Mozambique along the border with Zimbabwe, where it occurs in mist-belt forests, along streams and rivers, where it is often quite dominant, and in swampy areas. Wood: White, hard, and tough, often with a black centre. Bark: Young stems are covered by velvety brown hairs, maturing to greyish brown and hairless. Leaves: Leaves are entire and are both alternate and spirally arranged, elliptic to lanceolate, with a pointed tip and slightly more rounded base. Adult leaves are dark, glossy green above with dense, rusty to cream coloured hairs beneath, and are normally 7 cm long, but can range from 5 cm to 15 cm in length, and 2.5-7.5 cm wide. Petiole is 0.5\u20132 cm long. Flowers: Ranging in colour from yellowish green to cream, the spiky, ragged axillary or terminal heads are about 2 cm in diameter, and closely resemble Hamamelis in shape. Male and female parts are borne on separate flowers, either on the same specimen or different specimens (may be either monoecious or dioecious). Flowers from September to December. Fruit: Small, velvety, almost spherical 5x6cm capsules which split into 2 valves, each of which itself splits into two. Fruits are borne between December and February. == Subspecies == *Subsp. ellipticus: Endemic to South Africa and has smaller, narrower leaves with an attenuate apex. *Subsp. malosanus:The Plant List http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/tro-15100048 Occurs in Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique, and has noticeably larger, broader leaves with a slightly rounded apex. == Cultivation == Grows well in cool (temperate) greenhouses.
