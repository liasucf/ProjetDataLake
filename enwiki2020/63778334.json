    "text": "The Building at 923-925 Michigan Avenue is a historic apartment building at 923-925 Michigan Avenue in Evanston, Illinois. The three-story brick building was built in 1916. Architect Robert De Golyer, who designed several apartment buildings in Evanston and Chicago, designed the building; he also moved into the building once it was complete. The building's design features bow windows, pilasters and a fanlight around the entrance, and a dentillated cornice. Each of the building's six apartments included living rooms with fireplaces, sun porches, maid's rooms, vacuum systems, and access to heated garages. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 1984. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Apartment buildings in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1916 ",
