In their ninth and final season under head coach Paul J. Schissler, the Beavers compiled a 4\u20136 record (1\u20134 against PCC opponents), finished in eighth place in the PCC, and outscored their opponents, 130 to 109. Under coach Schissler, from 1925 to 1932, no team captains were elected. The team played its home games at Bell Field in Corvallis, Oregon. On January 10, 1933, Paul Schissler resigned as Oregon State's football coach. The resignation followed a request by administrators for a reduction in his $8,000 per year salary. In nine years as Oregon State's head coach, Schissler compiled a 48\u201330\u20132 record. ==Schedule== ==References== Category:Oregon State Beavers football seasons Oregon State Category:1932 in sports in Oregon ",
