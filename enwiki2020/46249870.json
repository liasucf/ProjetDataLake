He earned the titles of \"dean of hydrocarbon chemistry\" and \"designer and builder of gasolines\" through his years of pioneering research in the syntheses and testing of hydrocarbon components of gasoline. In 1955, Dr. Boord was awarded the prized Joseph Sullivant Medal in recognition of \"notable achievement\" in the arts and sciences by an alumnus or faculty member of Ohio State. The Boord olefin synthesis, a reaction he discovered in 1930, is named after him.The synthesis of beta-bromo-alkyl ethers and their use in further synthesis Lloyd C. Swallen and Cecil E. Boord J. Am.

He wrote the chapter on aliphatic compounds in the 1933 Annual Survey of American Chemistry published for the National Research Council. ==External links== *Annual Survey of American Chemistry ==References== Category:American chemists Category:1969 deaths Category:Wabash College alumni ",
