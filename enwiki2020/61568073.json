    "text": "Heylor is a settlement situated on the south side of Ronas Voe in Northmavine, Shetland, Scotland. It lies directly opposite Ronas Hill, Shetland's tallest mountain. == Etymology == The name Heylor comes from the Old Norse hellir meaning cave or cavern, of which there are several (most only accessible by sea) on the west side of Ronas Voe. == History == One of the earliest mentions of Heylor could be in a document describing the division of Hans Sigurdson's property in 1490, by which it is referred to as Heleland. Heylor also appears in a 1545 document confirming an agreement in an older 1516 document stipulating the transfer of land between Udal landowners. Heelle is believed to refer to Heylor. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Norse !English Translation |- |Allom godom mannom thenam som thette breff Hendhr fforr atth Komma Helssom wij effthrschriffne Mendt Niels willomssonn lauggmandt wdj hieltlandt Tomes Rigadzonn Mag[n]us Jonsszonn Tomes Engusszonn Indb\u00ffgge \u00ff samme landhe Kierlige medt gude Kunnochgorend atth anno d\u00f1i M.

Then an agreement was made, and it was confirmed, with full consent, among the heirs, that the said Niels Tomesson should have twenty merks burnt [of silver] in Eyde, and ten merks in West Brecka; but the said Margret Sanders daughter should get for her share in return twelve merks in Heelle, which her father chose for himself as a Head Bull, while in full possession of his faculties, on the right seventh day with his [ ? ]. And the said Sander was the oldest brother, and had therefore the first choice. And the other lands are to be taken and laid under the Head Bull, and it is to be made equally good as Eyde, according to the number of merks; and this exchange has been consented to on both sides that it shall be valid and inviolable everlastingly. In confirmation of this, we, the above- written men, impress our seals underneath this letter, which is written year and day as above. |} There used to be a post office in Heylor, which gives rise to the fact that many residences several miles away from Heylor still retain Heylor in their postal addresses. == Notes == == References == == Sources == * * * Category:Villages in Mainland, Shetland Category:Northmavine ",
