They are members of the National Socialist White People's Party, a United States Nazi party started by George Rockwell.The California Reich The film received a nomination at the 1976 Academy Awards in the Best Documentary category.Awards Information for The California Reich. IMDb. Retrieved March 7, 2015. It was also screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition. The film features scenes with Jewish Defense League (JDL) leader Irv Rubin confronting American Nazis. The documentary was \"Unofficially sanctioned by the Nazis and The Jewish Anti-Defamation League finds it too mild in its condemnation.\" == Production == According to a report in The New York Times the journalist, John J. O'Connor, the two filmmakers \"Spent more than a year with the Neo-Nazis before cameras were allowed to record families and rituals.\" The filmmakers were quoted in the same article that they \"Wanted to show the Nazis as members of our society, not as human monsters, but the people next door.\" The documentary borrows its style from the French film movement Cinema V\u00e9rit\u00e9 where narration was absent through the film and they let the subjects speak for themselves. == Reception == In his 1978 report John J. O'Connor said the filmmakers \"Succeed all too well as their working-class subjects become grotesque parodies of disturbing elements that can be detected in varying degrees at all levels of society.\" in response to their goal to not portray the communities as monsters. He also said that the \"most poignant episodes involves a 10 year old boy who says he does not share his father's philosophy. He goes to youth meetings to please his dad.\" == Legacy == The opening of this film shows NSWPP member Arnie Anderson recording a racist outgoing message on the party's phone machine. Later, the film shows a gathering of Nazis giving a Pledge of Allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Portions from both of these were used in the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\" as the speech given by the leader of the \"American Socialist White People's Party\" during a rally in a Chicago park, as he taunts angry counter-protesters. ==See also== * American Nazi Party * German American Bund * Neo-Nazism * Neo-Nazi groups of the United States ==References== ==External links== * * NSWPP California Reich P1 - YouTube * NSWPP California Reich P2 - YouTube * NSWPP California Reich P3 - YouTube * NSWPP California Reich P4 - YouTube * NSWPP California Reich P5 - YouTube * NSWPP California Reich P6 - YouTube *Leftists Clash With Nazis - Google News *Press Boycott Forces Nazi Center To Close - Google News *Critics Wreck Nazi Bookstore - Google News Category:1975 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about racism in the United States Category:1975 documentary films Category:Neo-Nazi organizations in the United States Category:Films shot in California Category:White nationalism in California ",
