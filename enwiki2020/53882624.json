The film was made at the Babelsberg Studios by Terra Film one of Germany's four dominant production companies. The film's sets were designed by Erich Grave. The film's release was considerably delayed by Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda ministry after an initial screening in 1944 led to numerous objections. Attempts to improve it meant it was not released before the end of the Second World War. It finally premiered in Sweden in 1947 before going on general release in West Germany in 1951. ==Cast== * Winnie Markus as Christine Schweiger * Hans St\u00fcwe as Professor Albrecht G\u00f6tz * Ernst Waldow as Rudolf Krummholz * Eva Maria Meineke as Anni * Hans Brausewetter as Wasner * Carola Toelle as Frau Schweiger * Karl Etlinger as Geschwander * Curt Ackermann as Herr Maximilian * Kate K\u00fchl as Frau Pospischil * Anneliese W\u00fcrtz as Frau Hirblinger * Karl Meixner as Kriminalbeamter * Erich Fiedler as Dr. Steinacker * Herbert Gernot as Augenarzt * Karl Troxb\u00f6mker as Diener * Martha von Konssatzki as Blumenfrau == References == == Bibliography == * == External links == * Category:1944 films Category:1944 romantic drama films Category:German films Category:Films of Nazi Germany Category:German-language films Category:Films directed by Peter Pewas Category:Terra Film films Category:German romantic drama films Category:German black-and-white films Category:Films shot at Babelsberg Studios Category:1944 drama films ",
