    "text": "Image of the species. Mesomys is a genus of South American spiny rats in the family Echimyidae. The genus name Mesomys derives from the two ancient greek words (), meaning \"middle of, between\", and (), meaning \"mouse, rat\". It refers to the fact that this rodent \u2014 literally the \"middle mouse\" \u2014 has been considered as an intermediate form related both to mice and jumping rats. ==Extant Species== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The closest relative of Mesomys is Lonchothrix, reflecting the fact that these taxa have once been classified in the Eumysopinae, a subfamily now recognized as an artificial assemblage. These two genera share phylogenetic affinities with several taxa and clades: (i) Echimys, Phyllomys, Makalata, Pattonomys, and Toromys ; (ii) the bamboo rats Dactylomys, Olallamys, Kannabateomys together with Diplomys and Santamartamys ; and (iii) Isothrix. ==References== Category:Rodent genera Category:Taxa named by Johann Andreas Wagner ",
