(The population figures are drawn from a statistical extrapolation from 30 June 2003) The community of Dorlar had itself incorporated into Wetzlar in 1972. Wetzlar, Gie\u00dfen, Atzbach, Waldgirmes and 12 other municipalities formed from 1977 to 1979 the city of Lahn. Within Lahn, the constituent communities of Waldgirmes, Dorlar and Atzbach the Stadtbezirk (roughly \"borough\") of Lahntal. After the city of Lahn was dissolved, the borough became an independent community under the name Lahnau on 1 August 1979 The constituent community of Dorlar thereby managed to belong to four different municipalities over only seven years, which stands as a curiosity even in the complex history of Hessian municipal reform. ==Public institutions== ===Educational institutions=== *Lahntalschule Lahnau (district integrated comprehensive school in Atzbach) *Grundschule WaldgirmesAs of 2012 it has also taken on the function of the now defunct Grundschule Atzbach ===Sports and leisure=== *Trimm-Dich-Pfad Atzbach (path) *Sportpark Lahnau in Dorlar, artificial turf and hard court, athletic facility *Indoor and outdoor swimming pool with 50m \u00d7 12.5m basin and broad sunbathing lawn *Riding hall and square *Sports ground in Waldgirmes, natural and artificial turf ===Clubs=== *TSV Atzbach (gymnastic and sport club) *SC 1929 Waldgirmes (sport club) *TV05 Waldgirmes (gymnastic club) *TSG Dorlar (gymnastic and sport club) *AS LahnLaender Lahnau *CVJM Atzbach-Dorlar (YMCA) *CVJM Waldgirmes (YMCA) *S\u00e4ngervereinigung Waldgirmes (singers' association) *Deutsch-Englischer Freundeskreis Lahnau e.V.
