A letter sent by Ashur Yusef to his brother Hanna Yusef in the U.S., during his jail term before his execution: > Monday April 20, 1915 From my cell to my beloved brother, Hanna Yousouf in > America. Yesterday on Sunday morning April 19th 1915 when we had heard that > the Turks were crazed with the anger of beastly slaughter, sparing neither > man woman or child we became terrified. Especially when the news came of the > arrests of my comrades, I began to shiver, and during the course of > preparing a hiding place, I myself was arrested and brought to this cell. > This is a good opportunity that I am enjoying to write you my last letter, > for I know we will be cut to pieces when we leave here, though I do not know > when and where. Do not worry over my death-it is God's will- I am going to > heaven to protect the rights of the Assyrians at the presence of the biggest > and greatest Judge. The books and the work I had started about our nation's > education remains unfinished. I am afraid they will be destroyed in a very > short time. One of my biggest desires has been to keep our brother Donabed > away from drink. I'd have given anything under the sun to have made him > temperate but it was in vain. I will give him my last advice after I finish > writing to you. I leave my loving wife and children in your care. My son > Isaak was to graduate from high school this year. I had intended to give him > a college education, which is another unfinished task I leave in your hands. > The time is almost up and I close this sad missive with wishes for your > welfare and safety, so that God may some day lead you to revenge on your > enemies!
