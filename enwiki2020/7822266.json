    "text": "Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld's farm in Back\u00e5kra Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld's farm at Back\u00e5kra (), close to Ystad in southern Sweden, was bought in 1957 as a summer residence by Hammarskj\u00f6ld, then Secretary-General of the United Nations (1953-1961). The farm was in decline and its restoration came to last until after Hammarskj\u00f6ld's death in 1961. It is maintained by the Swedish Tourist Association, as a museum displaying artifacts of his tenure at the UN. The south wing of the farm is reserved as a summer retreat for the 18 members of the Swedish Academy, of which Hammarskj\u00f6ld was a member. There is an outdoor meditation site on the property. Back\u00e5kra is the name of the village to which the farmstead belongs. Due to the 1803 land reform in Scania, farms were moved out of the village with the result that Back\u00e5ra is now chiefly a land register. Its local school, the folkskola, is today a summer hostel run by the Swedish Hiking Association. The lands of the village are situated less than a mile from the shores of the Baltic in the \u00d6sterlen area of Scania. Known for its summer cottages and outdoor recreation, the area is popular with tourists. In April 2018, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting at Back\u00e5kra. They rarely have meetings outside the UN headquarters in New York. == References == == External links == *Back\u00e5kra farmstead tourism information by the City of Ystad *Back\u00e5kra Youth Hostel by the Swedish Hiking Association Category:Populated places in Sk\u00e5ne County Category:Swedish Academy ",
