Jumo was founded by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. On August 17, 2011 he announced Jumo was merging with the GOOD organization, providing a social engagement platform to complement their magazine content.Chris Hughes, Jumo and GOOD Combine Forces to Create Content and Social Engagement Platform , Jumo blog, August 17, 2011 ==Acquisition== On August 17, 2011, Jumo announced that it had been acquired by the GOOD, a collaborative magazine and event media company headquartered in Los Angeles, USA. The company blog states the purpose to be \"to create a powerful online content and social engagement platform\". One of the reasons behind that acquisition is believed to be that Jumo's platform was not receiving the level of user traffic it has anticipated to grow itself. ==Open source== Two months after being acquired by GOOD, Jumo announced the release of their entire code base into the public domain on October 5, 2011. With this release, the company said that \"the community will have access to functionality that enables users to create and curate content and actions around more than 250 issue areas, from human trafficking to childhood obesity\". ==References== Category:American review websites Category:Charity review websites ",
