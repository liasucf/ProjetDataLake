Stetter was long known by the notname Master W. S. with the Maltese cross until he was identified in 1952 by the scholar Jean Rott (1911\u20131998). As well as a painter, stylistically influenced by Hans Baldung and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Stetter was a member of the Order of Saint John since 1510 (first as an acolyte, then ordained as a priest in 1512). Works by Stetter are on display in the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019\u0152uvre Notre-Dame in his hometown, in the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne and in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in Nancy. == References == == External links == Category:People from Strasbourg Category:16th-century German painters Category:1487 births Category:1552 deaths Category:German Renaissance painters Category:Painters from Alsace Category:German male painters Category:16th- century Roman Catholic priests Category:Knights Hospitaller ",
