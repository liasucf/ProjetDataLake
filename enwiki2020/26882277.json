    "text": "Zygoballus melloleitaoi is a species of jumping spider which occurs in Argentina. It is known only from a single female specimen collected in Puerto Victoria, Misiones. ==Taxonomy== The species was originally described in 1945 by Brazilian arachnologist C\u00e2ndido Firmino de Mello-Leit\u00e3o as Gastromicans sexpunctata. In 1980, the Argentinian arachnologist Mar\u00eda Elena Galiano transferred the species to the genus Zygoballus. Because the name Zygoballus sexpunctatus was already in use, Galiano gave the species a new name, Zygoballus melloleitaoi, in honor of Mello-Leit\u00e3o. Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski's Global Species Database of Salticidae lists the species as \"dubious\". However, it is listed as a recognized species by Platnick's World Spider Catalog (Version 10.5). ==Description== The only known specimen is a female 4 mm in length. The type specimen is housed at the La Plata Museum in Argentina (Zenzes collection, No. 16.785). ==References== ==External links== *Zygoballus melloleitaoi at Worldwide database of jumping spiders *Zygoballus melloleitaoi at Global Species Database of Salticidae (Araneae) Category:Salticidae Category:Spiders described in 1980 Category:Spiders of Argentina ",
