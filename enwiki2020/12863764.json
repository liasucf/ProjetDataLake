    "text": "Bulbophyllum jaapii is a species of plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is endemic to Cameroon. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It was described botanically in 2001. The distribution and range of B. jaapii is extremely limited; confined entirely to the summit forests and scrublands of a singular mountain in Camaroon (Mount Kupe, a dormant volcano on the Western High Plateau), at elevations of approximately 1,800 meters. It was first collected in November (during flowering), 1985 as a new discovery by D.W. Thomas and H.L. MacLeod, whom characterized them as locally common. However, despite several detailed surveys of the area a decade later, no further specimens have been collected. Although its habitat is situated above the elevation where local human activity could pose a significant threat, B. jaapii is more subject to catastrophic reduction in population from a singular event, such as a mudslide or forest fire, owing to its extremely small and isolated range. == References == == External links == * Specimen isotype of B. jaapii from Aluka.org * Specimen holotype of B. jaapii from Aluka.org * Specimen filed as B. jaapii from Aluka.org jaapii Category:Endemic orchids of Cameroon Category:Plants described in 2001 Category:Vulnerable flora of Africa Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
