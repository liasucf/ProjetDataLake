(1870), p282, Mysore and Coorg: Mysore, by districts, Chapter: Mysore district, Section:Yedaore, Vol 2, Mysore Government Press The name Yedatore derives from two Kannada language words, yeda (lit, \"left\") and tore (lit, \"river\") - a name that arises from the \"bend to the left\" made by the river at that spot which is considered sacred by Hindus. There are steps leading from the temple down to the bathing areas (\"ghats\") by the river.Rice B.L. (1887), p316, Mysore: A Gazetteer Compiled for Government - vol 2, Asian Educational Services, Yedatore village was severely damaged in the 1920s from the flood waters of the River Kaveri, prompting the Mysore ruler to build the new town, named Krishnarajanagar, little southerly on an elevated land. The Arakeshwara Temple is a Hindu temple in Hale Yedatore. The present temple complex dates back at least to early 19th century rule of the Mysore Kingdom and is built in typical dravidian style. According to the British Raj era historian and epigraphist B. Lewis Rice, the temple was endowed by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the ruler of the princely Mysore, during the British rule over India. However, the original temple as such is much older, of the era of Kulottunga Chola I.http://www.karnatakaarchaeology.gov.in/arkeshwara-temple- yedatore-krishnarajanagar-mysuru/ The Arakeshwara temple is a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India. Yadatore Sri Yogandeshwara Saraswathi samasthanam in Krishnarajanagar, Mysore District is also located on the banks of Kaveri, opposite to Arakeshwara Temple, westerly.
