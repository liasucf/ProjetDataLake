After three seasons in Women's First League, the team was relegated to the Women's Second League for the 2012\u201313 season. As a result, Antalyaspor's club management decided to close the women's football branch. The team merged with the other women's football club in Antalya, the D\u00f6\u015femealt\u0131 K\u0131rkg\u00f6z Gen\u00e7lik Spor and was renamed 1207 Antalya Muratpa\u015fa Belediye Spor.

At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, they became league champion, and were promoted to the Women's First League again in the 2015\u201316 season. The team played three seasons in the Women's First League, but at the end of the 2017-18 League season, they were relegated to the Women's Second League.

After playing two seasons in the Women's Second League, the team were promoted to the Women's First League againaccording to point average by decision of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) as the season could not be completed due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. ;Team name history * 2006\u20132008 Antalya Yeni Kap\u0131spor * 2008\u20132010 Antalyaspor * 2011\u20132012 Medical Park Antalyaspor * 2012\u20132014 1207 Antalyaspor * 2014\u20132016 1207 Antalya Muratpa\u015fa Belediye Spor * 2016\u20132018 1207 Antalya D\u00f6\u015femealt\u0131 Belediye Spor * 2018\u2013pres 1207 Antalyaspor Kad\u0131n Futbol Kul\u00fcb\u00fc ==Colors== 1207 Antalya Spor's colors are orange and black. ==Stadium== The team play their home matches at the Zeytink\u00f6y Stadium's Field #2. ==Statistics== . {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Season !!League !!Pos. !!Pld !!W !!D !!L !!GF !!GA !!GD !!Pts |-align=center bgcolor=#fcc |2006\u201307 ||align=left |Women's League \u2013 Div.
