    "text": "Mon oncle Antoine () is a 1971 National Film Board of Canada (Office national du film du Canada) French language drama film. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois director Claude Jutra co-wrote the screenplay with Cl\u00e9ment Perron and directed what is one of the most acclaimed works in Canadian film history. The film examines life in the Maurice Duplessis-era Asbestos Region of rural Qu\u00e9bec prior to the Asbestos Strike of 1949. Set at Christmas time, the story is told from the point of view of a 15-year-old boy (Beno\u00eet, played by Jacques Gagnon) coming of age in a mining town. The Asbestos Strike is regarded by Qu\u00e9bec historians as a seminal event in the years prior to the Quiet Revolution. Jutra's film is an examination of the social conditions in Qu\u00e9bec's old, agrarian, conservative and cleric-dominated society on the eve of the social and political changes that transformed the province a decade later. ==Plot== Beno\u00eet is a young teenage boy living in rural Quebec. He works at the town general store belonging to his aunt C\u00e9cile and his uncle, Antoine, who is also the town undertaker. On December 24 he begins work, setting up the store display much to the delight of the town and flirting with Carmen, the young girl whom his uncle and aunt employ, and treat as an adopted child. Madame Jos Poulin's eldest son, Marcel, dies that day and she places a call to the store asking if Antoine can come to take care of the body. For the first time Beno\u00eet is allowed to go with him. After they load the body into a coffin they prepare to take it home. However, on the way home Beno\u00eet encourages the horse to run as quickly as possible causing the coffin to fall off the sleigh. He tries to get Antoine to help put the coffin back on the sleigh; however, Antoine who has been steadily drinking throughout the day is unable to lift the coffin. He confesses to Beno\u00eet that he hates dealing with the dead bodies and that he is miserable in his life, wishing that he had achieved his dream of owning a hotel in the U.S. as he had wanted to. He further confesses that though he treats Beno\u00eet and Carmen like his own, he regrets that his wife was unable to give him children. Angry with Antoine, Beno\u00eet manages to get him back in the sleigh and returns home. He runs up the stairs to get help from his aunt and discovers her embracing Fernand, the help, in her nightgown. Realizing what has happened Fernand takes Beno\u00eet out in the sleigh to look for the body. Traumatized by seeing his aunt and Fernand together, Beno\u00eet is no help in remembering where the coffin fell off the sleigh. Eventually they make it back to the Poulin household where they find the entire Poulin family, including Jos, the father, who had been away working, around the coffin mourning the loss of Marcel. ==Cast== * Jacques Gagnon as Benoit * Lyne Champagne as Carmen * Jean Duceppe as Uncle Antoine * Olivette Thibault as Aunt C\u00e9cile * Claude Jutra as Fernand, Clerk * Lionel Villeneuve as Jos Poulin * H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Loiselle as Madame Poulin * Mario Dubuc as Poulin's son * Lise Brunelle as Poulin's daughter * Alain Legendre as Poulin's son * Robin Marcoux as Poulin's son * Serge Evers as Poulin's son * Monique Mercure as Alexandrine * Georges Alexander as The Big Boss * Rene Salvatore Catta as The Vicar ==Critical acclaim== The film has twice been voted the greatest Canadian film ever in the Sight & Sound poll, which is conducted once each decade.
