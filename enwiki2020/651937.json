The Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen (German: \"light armoured reconnaissance vehicle\") was a series of light four-wheel drive armoured cars produced by Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1944. ==Development history== The Sd.Kfz. 222 is the second in a series of light reconnaissance vehicles designed to meet operational requirements including reliability, an ability to run on a variety of grades of fuel, simple construction and good off-road performance, The first in the series was the Sd.Kfz. 221. This type proved too small and too lightly armed, so in 1936-37 a heavier version was planned, using one of two standard chassis for four-wheel armoured cars. One of these used a front-mounted engine, the other rear-mounted. The latter was used in the Sd.Kfz. 222, which became the standard light armoured car in German army service until the defeat of Nazi Germany. The vehicles were developed by Eisenwerk Weserh\u00fctte of Bad Oeynhausen by using the chassis of the type Horch 108 standard heavy off-road car with an angled armoured body and turret. Chassis were built by Horch (Auto Union) in Zwickau and assembled by F. Schichau of Elbing and Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen in Hanover-Linden. The rear-mounted petrol engine was originally a 3.5 Litre Horch V8 with (Ausf. A chassis); from 1942, this was replaced by a 3.8 Litre with (Ausf. B chassis), giving it a road speed of and a cross-country speed of . It had a maximum range of . Used by the reconnaissance battalions (Aufkl\u00e4rungs- Abteilung) of the Panzer divisions, the type performed well enough in countries with good road networks, like those in Western Europe. However, on the Eastern Front and North Africa, this class of vehicle was hampered by its relatively poor off-road performance. The Sd.Kfz. 222 was fitted with heavier armament and larger turret than the Sd.Kfz. 221 but it was still comparatively cramped and lacked top protection other than a wire screen designed to allow grenades to roll off, but this made using the main armament problematic. Co- axially mounted with the machine gun both weapons were pintle-mounted, and fitted with an elevation and traverse mechanism and floor-mounted firing mechanisms. The turret was rotated by the traversing weapons rather than the weapons being fixed to a traversing turret. There was thus no bearing-ring and no turret basket, only a fighting compartment largely obstructed by the breaches of the weapons. When the limitations of the vehicle were highlighted during the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 the Sd.Kfz. 222 was gradually replaced in the reconnaissance role by the Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track, but the turret and armament of the Sd Kdz 222 was sometimes retained, despite its shortcomings (the Sd.Kfz. 250/9 variant was a Sd.Kfz. 250 fitted with a top plate surmounted by the same turret used for the Sd.Kfz 222 with the same pintle-mounted guns refitted to the half-track) and captured Sd.Kfz 222s were examined by Soviet designers before they created the similar BA-64 light armoured car. Front and sides were made of RHA; thinner plates protected the top, rear, and bottom. Cast vision ports later replaced ports cut into the armour. The open-topped turret was fitted with wire mesh anti-grenade screens. Beginning in 1939, the front armour was increased to . In 1942, the Ausf. B chassis was introduced; this had 30 mm of frontal armour, as well as a more powerful engine. ==Variants== ;Sd. Kfz. 221 Base model and first production series of light armoured car built on a standardized chassis for military use. The Sd.Kfz. 221 was armed with a single 7.92 mm Maschinengewehr 13 machine gun (from 1938 a Maschinengewehr 34), manned by a two-man crew, and had 4-wheel drive. Production ran from 1935 to 1940 with at least 339 vehicles produced for the army. Some Sd. Kfz 221 were rearmed with a 2.8 cm sPzB 41 \"heavy anti- tank rifle\" in a modified turret. Its full name was Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen (M.G.). It was only produced with Ausf. A chassis and a maximum frontal armour of 14.5 mm. ;Sd. Kfz. 222 This version of the vehicle was armed with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a 7.92 mm MG 13 machine gun. The crew was increased to three by the addition of a gunner, relieving the commander of that task. In 1938, the MG 13 was replaced by a Maschinengewehr 34, in 1942 the KwK 30 was replaced by the faster firing KwK 38 of the same calibre. Production ran from 1937 to late 1943, with at least 990 vehicles being produced for the army. Its full name was Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen (2 cm). ;Sd. Kfz. 223 An armoured car with similar features to the Sd. Kfz. 221, but with the addition of a frame antenna and a 30-watt FuG 10 medium-range radio set. Later versions of the vehicle were equipped with an improved 80-watt FuG 12 radio set. It was originally armed with a 7.92 mm MG 13 machine gun, but in 1938 this was changed to a Maschinengewehr 34. The crew was increased to three by the addition of a radio operator. Production ran from 1936 to January 1944, with at least 567 vehicles being produced for the army. Its full name was Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen (Fu). ;Kleiner Panzerfunkwagen Sd. Kfz. 260/261 Unarmed radio car versions with long range radio equipment and a large \"bed-frame\" antenna over the vehicle. Generally used for signals use, three were used as armoured cars in Finland.Panzers in Finland, Kari Kuusela, 2000 The Sd. Kfz 260 was equipped with radio sets to communicate with aircraft, the Sd.Kfz. 261 with radio sets to communicate with other Heer units. By 1 September 1940, the manufacturers had orders for 36 Sd.Kfz. 260 and 289 Sd.Kfz. 261. Production ran from April 1941 to April 1943, with 483 vehicles of both types being produced. ==Users== * * (15 in total, mostly SdKfz 222, two SdKfz 221, at least one SdKfz 260) * * (see Romanian armored cars during World War II) ==Notes and references== * * ==External links== *www.warwheels.net - Sd.Kfz. 221 *www.warwheels.net - Sd.Kfz. 222 *www.warwheels.net - Sd.Kfz. 223 Category:World War II armoured fighting vehicles of Germany Category:Armoured cars of the interwar period Category:Military vehicles introduced in the 1930s ",
