In that summer, he appeared twice for the Portuguese under-21s at the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship on home soil, with Oliveira. ===APOEL=== Returning to Chelsea, Morais only appeared twice in the league, totalling less than 20 minutes in home draws against Manchester United and Everton and playing three times the FA Cup and the Football League Cup combined.Chelsea 6\u20131 Macclesfield; BBC Sport, 6 January 2007Chelsea 3\u20130 Nottingham Forest; BBC Sport, 28 January 2007Chelsea 4\u20130 Wycombe; BBC Sport, 23 January 2007 On 11 May 2007, he signed a two-year deal with Cypriot champions APOEL FC on a free transfer.Chelsea's Morais moves to Cyprus; BBC Sport, 12 May 2007 During his time in Nicosia, Morais was converted to a defensive midfielder, and signed a new contract until June 2012.

In the 2011\u201312 Champions League, Morais was an undisputed starter for APOEL as it reached the quarter-finals for the first time ever, playing all ten fixtures \u2013 including the round-of-16 triumph over Olympique Lyonnais where he converted his attempt in the penalty shootout.Lyon stunned as APOEL fairy tale continues; UEFA, 7 March 2012 On 4 May 2012, he agreed to a three-year extension to his link.
