    "text": "Malphas, by Louis Le Breton, 1863 A Picture depicting Malphas from Demons of Goetia In demonology, Malphas is a major demon. \"Malphas\" first appears in Johann Weirs Pseudomonarchia daemonum. Demonological sources describe him as a mighty Great President of Hell, with forty legions of demons under his command and is second in command under Satan. He appears as a raven, but if requested, will instead resemble a man with a hoarse voice. Malphas is said to build houses, high towers and strongholds, throw down the buildings of the enemies, destroy the enemies' desires or thoughts (and/or make them known to the conjurer) and all what they have done, give good familiars, and quickly bring artificers together from all places of the world. According to the writers, Malphas accepts willingly and kindly any sacrifice offered to him, but then he will deceive the conjurer. p.25 Malphas also resembles to the japanese karasu- tengu.
