    "text": "Yes Remixes is a remix album featuring the songs of progressive rock band Yes and was released in 2003. Taking material harking back from 1970's Time and a Word to 1980s Drama, Virgil Howe a.k.a. \"The Verge\" (and son of Steve Howe) re-imagined Yes's music into a techno context, dramatically altering the band's sound. Although it briefly dented the remix sales charts, the album failed to chart at all in the regular listings. ==Track listing== #\"Tempus Fugit\" (Geoff Downes/Trevor Horn/Steve Howe/Chris Squire/Alan White) \u2013 5:07 #\"Arriving UFO\" (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe/Rick Wakeman) \u2013 5:54 #\"Heart of the Sunrise\" (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Bill Bruford) \u2013 5:59 #\"Starship Trooper\" (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Steve Howe) \u2013 7:33 #\"Awaken\" (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe) \u2013 7:48 #\"Sound Chaser\" (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Steve Howe/Alan White/Patrick Moraz) \u2013 5:24 #\"Ritual\" (Jon Anderson/Chris Squire/Steve Howe/Rick Wakeman/Alan White) \u2013 6:20 #\"Siberian Khatru\" (Jon Anderson; Themes by Jon Anderson/Steve Howe/Rick Wakeman) \u2013 5:26 #\"Five Per Cent for Nothing\" (Bill Bruford) \u2013 4:40 #\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\" (Richie Havens) \u2013 4:44 #\"No Clowns\" (Jon Anderson/Bill Bruford/Geoffrey Downes/Trevor Horn/Steve Howe/Patrick Moraz/Chris Squire/Rick Wakeman/Alan White) \u2013 3:15 Yes Remixes (Rhino 78186) failed to chart in the UK or US. ==References== Category:Yes (band) remix albums Category:Albums produced by Eddy Offord Category:2003 remix albums Category:Rhino Records remix albums ",
