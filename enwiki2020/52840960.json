On 24 November 2016, Doordarshan journalist Satyendra Murli, claimed that the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018live\u2019 address had actually been pre-recorded and edited. At a press conference held at the Press Club of India in New Delhi, Satyendra Murli alleged that Narendra Modi misled the citizens of the country by recording the announcement and took a unilateral decision to demonetise notes, which made up over 85 per cent in circulation. He has filed an RTI requesting this information be made public. According to Satyendra Murli, Modi's 8 November address was not live, but recorded and edited. It had been written many days before the RBI's proposal (not decision), on the subject at 6 p.m. of 8 November and the briefing of the Cabinet by Modi at 7 p.m. Modi's address was broadcast at 8:15 p.m. with a live band, to create the impression that the decision had been taken suddenly, and the public would believe that the matter had been kept fully secret, but it was certainly not so. Whether the Government of India rules under Transaction of Business Rules, 1961 and the RBI Act, 1934, have been followed, is a moot question. ==References== ==External links== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Doordarshan journalists Category:Indian Institute of Mass Communication alumni Category:Gautam Buddha University Category:University of Rajasthan ",
