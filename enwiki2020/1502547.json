The project was scrapped in 1915 after initial tests deemed the vehicle to be underpowered and vulnerable to artillery fire. It has become known among industrial design students as a catastrophic failure of engineering without proper consideration to design. ==History== It differed from modern tanks in that it did not use caterpillar tracks--rather, it used a tricycle design. The two front spoked wheels were nearly in diameter; the rear-mounted third wheel was only high. The upper cannon turret reached a height of nearly . The hull was wide with two more cannon in sponsons. Additional weapons were also planned under the belly. Each wheel was powered by a Sunbeam engine. The huge wheels were intended to cross significant obstacles. However, due to miscalculations of the weight, the rear wheel was prone to getting stuck in soft ground and ditches, and the front wheels were sometimes insufficient to pull it out. This led to a fiasco of tests before the high commission in August 1915. The tank remained in the location where it was tested, some from Moscow until 1923 when it was finally taken apart for scrap.
