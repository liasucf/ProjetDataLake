    "text": "Storyville was a blues-rock band formed in 1993 in Austin, Texas, USA. Drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon, former members of Arc Angels and the rhythm section for Stevie Ray Vaughan's band Double Trouble, formed the band with Craig Ross, David Lee Holt and David Grissom after a jam session at Antone's. After releasing an album on November Records in 1993, the band won a total of nine Austin Music awards; they became stalwarts on the local music scene and toured nationally. Malford Milligan replaced Ross in 1994. They subsequently signed to major label Atlantic Records, for whom they recorded two albums before breaking up. The single \"Born Without You\", from their 1998 release Dog Years, reached #28 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.[ Billboard Singles], Allmusic ==Members== *Malford Milligan \u2013 lead vocals *David Grissom \u2013 guitar/vocals *David Lee Holt - guitar/vocals *Tommy Shannon \u2013 bass *Chris Layton \u2013 drums ==Discography== *Bluest Eyes - November Records, 1993 *A Piece Of Your Soul - Atlantic Records, 1996 U.S. Blues #5[ Billboard], Allmusic *Dog Years - Atlantic Records, 1998 U.S. Heatseekers #47 *Live At Antones - Storyville Records, 2007 ==See also== *Music of Austin ==References== ==External links== *Band website *Vintage Guitar Interview - David Grissom and David Holt - Two-Guitar Story *David Grissom's website *David Lee Holt's website *Tommy Shannon's website Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Texas ",
