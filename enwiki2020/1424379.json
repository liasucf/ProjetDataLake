He was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer but opted to try his fortunes overseas. Russell joined Sogndal of the Norwegian Premier League, where he established himself as one of the best right backs in Norway. This fact was confirmed when Rosenborg BK also from Norway made a move for him in 2004. Russell became a starter at right back in his first season with Rosenborg BK (including two starts for the team in the UEFA Champions League) and helped the team win its 19th league title. Unfortunately he only played in a couple of matches in 2005 due to a knee injury and a change in the coaching staff. In July 2006, Russell moved to Viborg FF of the Danish Superliga. His debut for Viborg FF came in a 3\u20131 loss at Aalborg BK. In July 2008, Russell ended his Scandinavian sojourn by signing with Real Salt Lake, where coach Jason Kreis was a fellow alumnus of Duke University. On November 23, 2009, Russell scored the game-winning goal of the 2009 MLS Cup in the seventh round of a penalty kick shoot out. The goal gave Real Salt Lake their first MLS championship. On May 29, 2010 he scored his first career goal for Real Salt Lake in a 4\u20131 victory over the Kansas City Wizards at Rio Tinto Stadium. On November 29, 2011, Russell was traded to D.C. United for a third-round pick in the 2013 MLS SuperDraft, which became a first-round pick in the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft when the SuperDraft was shortened. Interview with the VOA in 2013.
