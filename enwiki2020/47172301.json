The Return of the Mal\u00f3n (1892) \u00c1ngel Della Valle (10 October 1852, Buenos Aires - 16 July 1903, Buenos Aires) was an Argentinian painter in the Realistic style who belonged to the \"Generation of '80\" == Biography == He was born to an Italian immigrant family. His father was a construction manager, who worked on several major projects and was able to enroll \u00c1ngel at the Colegio San Jos\u00e9, a prestigious private school.\"Della Valle, \u00c1ngel - apenas Un Grande\" by Carlos Ra\u00fal Risso @ Escritor Costumbrista (originally published in Revista de mis Pagos, #19). He displayed an early aptitude for art and, although his father died in 1871, the following year, with the consent of his mother, he was able to go to Italy, where he studied with Antonio Ciseri in Florence.Biographical notes @ Fundaci\u00f3n Konex. He returned to Argentina in 1883, set up a workshop in the family home and soon became identified with a group of artists who would later become the founders of \"El Ateneo\", an artistic salon that also involved writers and musicians. These artists included the painters , Eduardo S\u00edvori, Ernesto de la C\u00e1rcova and Reynaldo Giudici, as well as the sculptors and . In 1893, this group began Argentina's first regular art exhibitions. At first, he concentrated on portraits. Among the best-known are those of his childhood friend, Dr.Pedro Lagleyze (1855-1916), a prominent ophthalmologist, and one of his patients, President Julio Argentino Roca.\"Dr. Pedro Lagleyze depicted in the visual arts\" by Dr. Ricardo Dar\u00edo Wainsztein @ the Consejo Argentino de Oftalmolog\u00eda. Overall, however, his best works are considered to be those depicting the countryside, the gaucho, and scenes of daily life among the common people. In 1892, he produced what is probably his most famous painting \"The Return of the Mal\u00f3n\". The following year it was exhibited in the Argentine pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also taught at the \"Sociedad de Est\u00edmulo de Bellas Artes\" (SEBA), founded in 1876 to be the nation's primary source for art instruction, remaining there as a drawing teacher for eighteen years. The school occupied the upper floors of a department store, now known as the Galer\u00edas Pac\u00edfico. Eventually, he devoted more of his time to developing young artists than he did to painting. He died suddenly, while teaching in his classroom. One of his students, , made a drawing of Valle's last moments. == References == == External links == *\"El campo y sus personajes en la obra de \u00c1ngel Della Valle\" by Lourdes Graciela Arin @ Centro Argentina de Investigadores de Arte (CAIA) *\"Los indios seg\u00fan \u00c1ngel Della Valle\" @ Carpetas Docentes de Historia *ArtNet: A few more works by Valle *Brief biography and more paintings @ Zurbaran Category:1852 births Category:1903 deaths Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Genre painters Category:Portrait painters Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:19th-century Argentine painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Argentine male painters ",
