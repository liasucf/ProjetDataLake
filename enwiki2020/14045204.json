Starting in 1967, they expanded their lineup to include more brass instruments, and regularly toured the Midwest, opening for Dickie Lee, Rufus Thomas, The Shangri-Las, Bobby Vee, and The Everly Brothers. Soon after meeting Thomas and Lee, they booked time at Sun Studios and recorded the single \"No, Not Much\", a cover of a 1950s hit by The Four Lads. The local disc (released on Goldust Records) was picked up for national distribution by Buddah Records, and the tune saw nationwide success, becoming a hit in several major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and climbing to #85 on the Billboard Hot 100 early in 1969.Chart Data, Billboard Magazine.

At that time, all he had left was drummer Danny Keller, so he nearly had to start from scratch. Lindy Gallaher (bass player from \"Isaac\" in Kansas) was the first to arrive, along with Colin Keefe (trumpet and lead vocals) and Mike Ragatz (trombone) from another regionally based horn band, \"The Chancellors\". Lindy suggested two other members from \"Isaac\": Robert Orr (keyboards and trombone) and Larry Stewart (trumpet, sax, and flute). The new players moved into Kings Ballroom (owned by band manager Joe Hupp) and put an entire show together in three days. Six months later, the band moved to Memphis, soon hired Tommy Shaw, and not long after that changed their name to MSFunk. MSFunk members later became members of Toto, The Ides of March, Styx, Damn Yankees, Le Roux, and Shaw Blades. ==Members== ;Little Joe & the Ramrods *Little Joe Hupp - guitar, piano *Doug Spiedel *Mike Sund (1944\u20131985) *Leland Grieves *Dino Reeves *Terry Zobel *Larry Young *John Schrad *Gene Hammerlun ;The Strollers *Chuck Asmus - drums, vocals *Pat Wead - guitar, vocals *Jerry Benjamin - guitar *Bob Hupp - bass, vocals *Jim Casey - guitar ;The Smoke Ring *Jerry Benjamin - drums, guitar (1966\u20131967) *Tom Benjamin - drums (1966\u201367) *Jim Casey - saxophone, guitar ('66-'69) *Dave Dohren - trumpet ('66-'70) *Bob Hupp - guitar ('66-'69) *Little Joe Hupp - keyboards ('66-'68) *Nick Hupp - bass ('66-'70) *John Schrad - saxophone ('66-'68) *Chuck Asmus - drums, vocals ('66-'68) *Roger Volk - drums ('68-'71) *Greg \"Bosco\" Goodman - keyboards ('69-'71) *Ron McClure - trumpet ('68-'69) *Mike \"Pinky\" Semrad - trumpet and guitar ('68-'69) *Steve Dahl - vocals *Jon Hischke - saxophone *Garth Fundis - vocals *Keith Goins - guitar, vocals ('70-'72) *Colin Keefe - vocals, trumpet ('71-'72) *Danny Keller -drums ('71-'72) *Tommy Shaw - guitar, vocals ('72) *Lindy Gallaher - bass ('71-'72) *Robert Orr - keyboards, trombone, vocals ('71-'72) *Mike Raggatz - trombone ('71-'72) *Larry Stewart - trumpet, sax ('71-'72) ;Transition to MS Funk *Keith Goins - guitar, vocals ('72-'74) *Danny Keller - drums ('72-'73) ('75-'76) *Lindy Gallaher - bass ('72-'76) *Colin Keefe - lead vocals, trumpet ('72-'74) *Robert Orr - keyboards, vocals, trombone ('72-'76) *Larry Stewart - trumpet, flute, sax, vocals ('72-'74) *Chaz Baker - trombone, vocals, electric piano ('72-'75) *Tommy Shaw - guitar, vocals ('72-75) *Fergie Frederiksen - vocals ('75 -'76) *Mike Borch - drums ('73-'75) *Richie Mayer - guitar, vocals ('75-'76) *Bobby Piatt - vocals ('75-'76) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Nebraska ",
