Kavanaugh, \"Alden Park Towers getting $5M makeover; nearly 90% leased,\" Model D, January 22, 2008 ==History== The Alden Park Towers were built in 1922 as the Berman Apartments. They were built south of Jefferson to take advantage of the natural beauty of the Detroit River. They were one of the few large apartment buildings built in Detroit. Triton Properties acquired the historic Alden Park Towers property, located on Detroit's Gold Coast (the East Jefferson riverfront) in 2012, out of foreclosure for $2 million in August 2012, and began a $5 million plus renovation of all 382 apartment units in the four towers. The project included renovation of common area, including a brand-new grand lobby with a large fireplace as the focal point, and a new fitness center with all-new equipment and flatscreen TVs. The entire building is outfitted with free Wi-Fi. The grand lobby, designed with assistance from Sharon Carlile of Royal Oak's Italmoda, mimics the lobby of a modern boutique hotel. Additionally, major renovation to the property's riverfront was undertaken. Renovation work was completed in the first quarter 2015. http://www.modeldmedia.com/devnews/aldentowersgrandunveiling.aspx ==See also== * Riverfront Towers. * International Riverfront ==References== ==External links== * Alden Towers Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Residential buildings completed in 1922 Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Apartment buildings in Detroit ",
