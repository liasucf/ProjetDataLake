    "text": "Weissenstein chair lift The Weissenstein (1,395 m) is a mountain of the Jura, located north of Solothurn in the Swiss canton of Solothurn. The culminating point of the chain is distinguished by the name R\u00f6ti. It is the easternmost summit above 1,300 metres in the Jura Mountains. Until the end of 2009 there was a chairlift (length: 2339 m) from Oberdorf to the spa hotel on the 1,284 metre-high summit near the Weissenstein Pass. It was replaced by a gondola lift at the end of 2014. The tunnel of the railway line Solothurn-Moutier from Oberdorf to G\u00e4nsbrunnen on the other side was opened in 1908. The gondola lift crosses the railway track in front of the tunnel portal at Oberdorf, which is the only setting of this kind in Switzerland. The pass road leading from the village of Oberdorf across the Weissenstein Pass (1279 m) to G\u00e4nsbrunnen is one of the steepest in Switzerland (22%). ==References== ==External links== * Seilbahn Weissenstein, the gondola lift operator, in German. * Weissenstein on Hikr Category:Mountains of Switzerland Category:Mountains of the canton of Solothurn Category:Mountains of the Jura Category:One-thousanders of Switzerland ",
