It served as an overflow for the junior department of the Royal Military College, shortly after the college was established in 1802, and also served as a boarding school in the 1860s but remained in the ownership of the Williams family until well into the 20th century. It went on to serve as a finishing school for girls in the 1950s and is now used as offices. ==References== Category:Grade I listed buildings in Buckinghamshire Category:Country houses in Buckinghamshire ",
