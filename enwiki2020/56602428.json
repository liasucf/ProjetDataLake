Grant *Byron Foulger as Sparky Jackson, also known as Lefty Jordan *John Cason as Bob Horn *Tom London as Col. McMasters *Holly Bane as Barton ==Producer== The film stars Margia Dean, who recalled \"Don Barry was very nice, pleasant and polite to me. But, he was short. And that can create something of a problem. Tom Neal was in it, and I found him to be the serious, brooding type.\" She says Holt was in the film because producer Robert L Lippert \"was good about using once-big names who were a little past their prime!... It was my first leading lady, but still a thankless part. You go in early in the morning for hair and makeup; then are driven a long ways to a dusty, hot, sticky location. At dusk, they take the leading lady's close-up\u2014just when she's grimy! (Laughs) Those tight corsets and five pounds of wigs were all uncomfortable\u2014as were those stagecoach rides\u2014which were so bumpy!
