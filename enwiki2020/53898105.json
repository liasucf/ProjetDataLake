She got her start making over a hundred book and magazine covers as well as the interior art for books in the 1980s, winning her two fan art Hugo Awards in 1981 and 1982. After marrying her husband, Julius Lisi in 1987, Poyser started going by the name Victoria Lisi. She now works on collaborative children's book illustration as well as instructional painting books such as Vibrant Children's Portraits: Painting Beautiful Hair and Skin Tones with Oils by Victoria Poyser Lisi (2010). Most of her earlier works were in acrylics but now Lisi prefers to work with watercolor because she loves the \u201ctransparency, delicacy and unpredictability.\u201d After teaching Illustration at Western Connecticut State University for six years, Poyser currently lives in Colorado and teaches drawing, painting, watercolor and figure drawing at Aims Community College in Loveland, Colorado. == Books and magazines == === Cover art=== * Double Exposure (1982) also appeared as: Die Doppelwelt [German] (1982) * Eight Keys to Eden (1982) * The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982) * Fantasy Mongers 7, 1983 (1983) * The Bones of Zora (1983) * Red as Blood, or Tales from the Sisters Grimmer (1983) * Greyhaven: An Anthology of Fantasy (1983) * Sung in Shadow (1983) * Moon Called (1983) * Stardance (1983) * The Emperor of Eridanus (1983) * Chaining the Lady (1984) * Chanur's Venture (1984) * Planet of Whispers (1984) * The Pig Plantagenet (1984) * Dicing With Dragons: An Introduction to Role-Playing Games (1984) * Sword and Sorceress (1984) * Ralestone Luck (1984) * Creation Descending (1984) * The Harper Hall of Pern (1984) * Castle Crespin (1984) * The Silver Horse (1984) * Web of Darkness (1984) * Returning Creation (1984) * Wheel of Stars (1984) * The Golden Sword (1984) * The Second Kingdom (1984) * Masters of Glass (1985) * Traitor to the Living (1985) * Wind from the Abyss (1985) * The Gorgon and Other Beastly Tales (1985) * Cluster (1985) with K.
