    "text": "Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern showing the two forms of Nickel-Iron, Kamacite and Taenite, in an octahedrite meteorite Taenite (Fe,Ni) is a mineral found naturally on Earth mostly in iron meteorites. It is an alloy of iron and nickel, with nickel proportions of 20% up to 65%. The name is derived from the Greek \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 for \"band, ribbon\". Taenite is a major constituent of iron meteorites. In octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving with kamacite forming Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, whereas in ataxites it is the dominant constituent. In octahedrites a fine intermixture with kamacite can occur, which is called plessite. Taenite is one of four known Fe-Ni meteorite minerals: The others are kamacite, tetrataenite, and antitaenite. ==Properties== It is opaque with a metallic grayish to white color. The structure is isometric-hexoctahedral. Its density is around 8 g/cm3 and hardness is 5 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale. Taenite is magnetic, in contrast to antitaenite. The crystal lattice has the c\u2248a= 3.582\u00b10.002 \u00c5. The Strunz classification is I/A.08-20, while the Dana classification is 1.1.11.2 . It is hexoctahedral (cubic) in structure. ==Meteorite localities with taenite== * Campo del Cielo crater in Argentina. * Henbury Meteorites Conservation Reserve in Australia. * Canyon Diablo in Arizona. ==See also== * Glossary of meteoritics * List of minerals == References == *Mason B., 1962: Meteorites.
