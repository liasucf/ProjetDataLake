    "text": "Automotive BMW plant using industrial robotics technology in Leipzig, Germany High technology (high tech) or frontier technology (frontier tech) is technology that is at the cutting edge: the most advanced technology available. It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224679583_High_technology_revisited_definition_and_position The opposite of high tech is low technology, referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device. The phrase was used in a 1958 The New York Times story advocating \"atomic energy\" for Europe: \"... Western Europe, with its dense population and its high technology ....\"\"Atomic Power for Europe\", The New York Times, February 4, 1958, p. 17. Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969: \"Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio] controls a score of high technology patents in a variety of fields.\"Metz, Robert (1969). \"Market Place: Collins Versus The Middle Man\", The New York Times, April 24, 1969, p. 64. and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form, \"high tech.\"Metz, Robert (1971). \"Market Place: So What Made E.D.S. Plunge?\", The New York Times, November 11, 1971, p. 72. A widely used classification of high-technological manufacturing industries is provided by the OECD.Hatzichronoglou, Thomas: \"Revision of the High-Technology Sector and Product Classification\", OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, No. 1997/02, OECD Publishing, Paris. It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD countries, resulting in four distinct categories. Startups working on high technologies (or developing new high technologies) are sometimes referred to as deep tech; the term may also refer to disruptive technologies based on scientific discoveries in several branches. High-tech, as opposed to high-touch, may refer to self-service experiences that do not require human interaction. ==See also== * Electronics * Electronics industry * Intermediate technology \u2013 sometimes used to mean technology between low and high technology * Industrial design * List of emerging technologies * Innovation * Semiconductor industry * Big Tech ==References== Category:Technology by type Category:Design ",
