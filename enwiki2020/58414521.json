    "text": "Martin Fackler (born November 19, 1966) is an American journalist and author. He has worked for more than two decades as a foreign correspondent in Japan and China, including six years as Tokyo bureau chief for The New York Times. He has written or co-written eight books in Japanese, including the best- seller Credibility Lost: The Crisis in Japanese Newspaper Journalism After Fukushima (Futabasha, 2012). In English, he co-edited Reinventing Japan: New Directions in Global Leadership (Praeger, 2018). He has also taught journalism at the University of Tokyo. Fackler appeared as himself in the Japanese film The Journalist (Japanese: Shimbun Kisha; 2019), directed by Michihito Fujii and based on a book by Japanese reporter Isoko Mochizuki. ==Biography== After graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1994, Fackler started his career as a journalist at Bloomberg News in 1996, working in Tokyo where he covered financial markets. The following year, he reported on a racketeering scandal involving corporate extortionists in Japan known as S\u014dkaiya who took millions of dollars from major brokerages and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Fackler's articles included a profile of the racketeer at the center of the scandal, Ryuichi Koike. Fackler worked for five years at the Associated Press in Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai and New York City. In April 2001, he covered the Hainan Island incident, when a U.S. Navy plane landed on the Chinese island of Hainan after colliding with a People's Liberation Army Navy jet fighter. Fackler returned to Tokyo in 2003 to work at The Wall Street Journal, where he covered the Japanese financial crisis caused by bad loans at banks and the so-called Takenaka Plan of the financial services minister, Heiz\u014d Takenaka, to end the crisis. Fackler worked in the Tokyo bureau of the New York Times starting as a freelancer in 2005 and working his way to business correspondent in 2007. Two years later, he was named Tokyo bureau chief, a post he held until 2015. During that time, he also wrote about South Korea, North Korea and China. In 2012, he was part of a team that was named as finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for its coverage of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and the Japanese government's refusal to disclose data on the spread of radiation to evacuees. The prize committee called their articles a \"powerful exploration of serious mistakes concealed by authorities in Japan after a tsunami and earthquake devastated the nation, and caused a nuclear disaster.\" In November 2011, Fackler was the first foreign reporter to enter the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after the disaster. Fackler has also written for magazines such as Foreign Policy and the Columbia Journalism Review about Japanese media issues, including a failed effort at investigative reporting at the daily Asahi Shimbun. Fackler has also contributed to Japanese journalism by serving as an adjunct researcher at Waseda University's Institute for Journalism, supporting the establishment of the Waseda Chronicle, a non-profit investigative reporting initiative. He told a symposium in Tokyo co-hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists: \u201cThere are some very admirable qualities of Japanese journalism. One is tenacity, the other is thoroughness. Journalists read all the documents; they cover all the basics.\u201d Fackler is fluent in Japanese and has written or co-written eight books in that language, including Credibility Lost: The Crisis in Japanese Newspaper Journalism After Fukushima, a critical look at Japanese media coverage of the nuclear disaster.http://www.futabasha.co.jp/booksdb/smp/book/bookview/978-4-575-15394-1/smp.html?c=32500&o;=date&type;=t&word;=\u30de\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30e9\u30fc In English, he was the lead editor of Reinventing Japan: New Directions in Global Leadership, a volume on Japan's new relevance to the world in an era when the postwar American-led order is being challenged. He has also worked as a Journalist in Residence at the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation (later renamed the Asia Pacific Initiative), a think tank in Tokyo. He has also served on the Media Advisory Board of The Japan Times. He is currently Assistant Asia Editor for the New York Times. == References == ==External links== * Category:1966 births Category:American male journalists Category:Living people ",
