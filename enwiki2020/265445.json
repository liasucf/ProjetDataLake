    "text": "Detroit Dam is a gravity dam on the North Santiam River between Linn County and Marion County, Oregon. It is located in the Cascades, about west of the city of Detroit. It was constructed between 1949 and 1953 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The dam created deep Detroit Lake, more than 9 miles (14 km) long with 32 miles (51 km) of shoreline. It is one of the dams authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938. Construction was delayed largely due to World War II. The dam, dedicated on June 10, 1953, was authorized for the purposes of flood control, power generation, navigation, and irrigation. Other uses are fishery, water quality, and recreation. It was built in concert with the Big Cliff Dam downstream.
