She presented her work in a number of exhibitions and illustrated collections. She combined her two principle passions, writing and painting, in contemporary comics. Between 2007 and 2010, she published three comic strips, one of which, La R\u00e9conciliation, she co- wrote with her father, Charles Rojzman. In 2016 Rojzman was awarded a special mention in the Art\u00e9misia Award, for Mourir (\u00e7a n'existe pas). The work draws on Rojzman's training in therapy, exploring childhood loss and anxieties. Her book \u00c9milie voit quelqu'un, with designer Anne Rouquette, was voted the top comic of 2015 by readers of the magazine Les Inrockuptibles. == References == Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:French women illustrators Category:French comics artists Category:French illustrators Category:Biography articles of living people Category:French female comics artists Category:Female comics writers ",
