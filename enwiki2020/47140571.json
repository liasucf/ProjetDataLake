    "text": "Extraordinary X-Men was a comic series from Marvel Comics and the flagship X-Men title under the All-New, All-Different Marvel re-branding. The story takes place following the conclusion of the Secret Wars crossover event. In this comic series, mutants are again faced with possible extinction due to Terrigen Mist which causes exposed mutants to become sterile and possibly suffer from a fatal degenerative disease called \"M-Pox\". The gas also prevents the activation of the X-Gene. The series ended with #20. ==Publication History== To reboot the X-Men series, Jeff Lemire was hired to write Extraordinary X-Men, with Humberto Ramos as penciller and Victor Olazaba as inker. The new series launched October 2015 and, on its release, was the fifth-highest-selling comic book with over 133,000 copies sold.http://comicbook.com/2015/09/16/extraordinary-x-men-1-preview- released/http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2015/2015-11.html The book, along with All-New X-Men, was cancelled following the Inhumans vs. X-Men event and, as a part of Marvel's ResurrXion rebranding, the story of the X-Men continued in X-Men Gold, X-Men Blue, X-Men Red and Astonishing X-Men.https://www.newsarama.com/32508-x-men-101-what-you-need-to-know-for- resurrxion.html ==Plot summary== ===X-Haven=== After the release of the Terrigen Mist, Storm, Iceman and Magik have decided to leave the Westchester and establish X-Haven in the Limbo dimension. Their goal is to protect healthy mutants from the Terrigen and to provide safe care for mutants who were infected by it. Before leaving they try to recruit old friends: Colossus, living quietly in Russia; Nightcrawler, recently abducted; and Jean Grey, who is attending college. Jean initially refuses to join, but reveals that she has sensed Wolverine, who should be dead. Storm is successful in only recruiting Colossus, but as he and Magik go to investigate Nightcrawler's disappearance, they are abducted by the Marauders. Mister Sinister is experimenting on blending Inhuman DNA with Mutant DNA. He hopes that Magik's sorcery will be the key, since all previous experiments failed. When he knocks out Magik, the defenses for X-Haven fall apart and demons start attacking the school. Storm, Ice Man, Anole, Glob Herman, Ernst, and Cerebra (who is implanted into a Sentinel) try to defend, while Forge creates a failsafe shield. Back in NYC, Jean Grey is disgusted when she sees humans attacking an Inhuman, thinking he is a mutant. She uses her powers and her current boyfriend Chris is horrified that he is dating a mutant. She then meets with Old Man Logan and convinces him that since he is from a different timeline he won't kill the X-Men in this dimension and she'll do whatever she can to protect him from himself. They are then teleported to X-Haven and help with the final defenses before Forge powers up a shield. With X-Haven safe, they travel to Nightcrawler's last location and Wolverine tracks them into the sewers where they confront Mister Sinister and the Marauders. He reveals that he is only trying to save the mutant race, but they are doomed for extinction. His only experiment to blend the Inhuman and mutants was a clone of Cyclops, who then rampages through New York City. After the battle, Storm announces that the X-Men are opening X-Haven to any mutant seeking sanctuary from the Terrigen Mist, and mean no harm to humans or inhumans and will also be there to help them if needed.
