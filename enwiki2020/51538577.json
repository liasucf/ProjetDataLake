It was officially announced on February 21, 2016, and released later that year. == Specifications == The HP Elite x3 was built for enterprise users with several enterprise specific features such as high-end processing power (Qualcomm Snapdragon 820), large and bright display (Samsung 5.96\" WQHD OLED), IP67, MIL-STD 810G, Dual biometric authentication with Iris and fingerprint scanner, 2x2 MIMO 802.11ac, Cat 6 LTE, Bang & Olufsen sound, USB-C charging with a 4,150mAh battery and Qi/PMA wireless charging. === Continuum === Setting it apart from other premium smartphones, HP Elite x3's defining feature is its ability to connect to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse via the HP Desk Dock, providing a desktop PC-like environment, powered by Microsoft's Continuum feature on Windows 10 Mobile. HP also offers the HP Lap Dock, which is a laptop shell that does not have any computing power in itself (i.e. no CPU, no Motherboard, no HDD, etc.), but connects to the Elite x3 via wired (USB-C) or wireless (802.11ac) connection and powers the Lap Dock, which is essentially a display terminal with a keyboard, trackpad, battery and I/O ports in a laptop form factor.http://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-elite-x3-lap- dock-with-premium-packaginghttp://www.zdnet.com/product/hp-elite-x3-lap-dock/ == Reception == Debuting at Mobile World Congress 2016, the HP Elite x3 garnered over 30 \"Best of MWC\" awards.HP Elite x3 review: The phablet that wants to be your only computerUbergizmo\u2019s Best of MWC 2016MWC 2016: six of the hottest new smartphones and gadgets However, despite some positive reviews by critics,MWC 2016: HP unveils the Elite x3, a business-class Windows 10 phabletHP Elite x3 review: A beautiful, capable phone limited by its OSHP Elite x3 review: This could be the last great Windows phone sales have been less than expected due to diminishing market position of Windows 10 Mobile as a viable Mobile OS platform.Just when you thought Windows Phone couldn\u2019t get any more dead\u2026 While HP's sales and marketing have been focused on targeting enterprise customers, consumers are able to purchase the Elite x3 and the Desk Dock and Lap Dock at hp.com websitehttp://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/hp- elite-x3-414504--1?jumpid=top_breadcrumb#!&tab;=vao as well as in Microsoft Stores, both offline and online.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/hp- elite-x3-bundle-unlocked/8wr4klx6m5gt/https://www.microsoft.com/en- us/store/d/HP-Elite-x3-Lap-Dock- Bundle/8MG673NWC7TV?icid=Phone_cat_Hero_HPEliteX3 ==Model variants== There is an EMEA+APJ model, an Americas model, and an Americas model connected by Verizon (US only).http://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c05193008 == References == == External links == * http://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp- elite-x3-and-hp-elite-x3-desk-dock Elite x3 Category:Windows 10 Mobile devices Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2016 Category:Videotelephony Category:Mobile phones Category:Smartphones ",
