    "text": "In topology and related branches of mathematics, a totally disconnected space is a topological space that is maximally disconnected, in the sense that it has no non-trivial connected subsets. In every topological space, the singletons (and, when it is considered connected, the empty set) are connected; in a totally disconnected space, these are the only connected subsets. An important example of a totally disconnected space is the Cantor set. Another example, playing a key role in algebraic number theory, is the field of p-adic numbers. ==Definition== A topological space X is totally disconnected if the connected components in X are the one-point sets. Analogously, a topological space X is totally path-disconnected if all path- components in X are the one-point sets. ==Examples== The following are examples of totally disconnected spaces: *Discrete spaces * The rational numbers * The irrational numbers * The p-adic numbers; more generally, all profinite groups are totally disconnected. * The Cantor set and the Cantor space * The Baire space * The Sorgenfrey line * Every Hausdorff space of small inductive dimension 0 is totally disconnected * The Erd\u0151s space \u21132\\, \\cap \\, \\mathbb{Q}^{\\omega} is a totally disconnected Hausdorff space that does not have small inductive dimension 0. * Extremally disconnected Hausdorff spaces * Stone spaces * The Knaster\u2013Kuratowski fan provides an example of a connected space, such that the removal of a single point produces a totally disconnected space. ==Properties== *Subspaces, products, and coproducts of totally disconnected spaces are totally disconnected. *Totally disconnected spaces are T1 spaces, since singletons are closed. *Continuous images of totally disconnected spaces are not necessarily totally disconnected, in fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set. *A locally compact Hausdorff space has small inductive dimension 0 if and only if it is totally disconnected. *Every totally disconnected compact metric space is homeomorphic to a subset of a countable product of discrete spaces. *It is in general not true that every open set in a totally disconnected space is also closed. *It is in general not true that the closure of every open set in a totally disconnected space is open, i.e. not every totally disconnected Hausdorff space is extremally disconnected. ==Constructing a totally disconnected space== Let X be an arbitrary topological space. Let x\\sim y if and only if y\\in \\mathrm{conn}(x) (where \\mathrm{conn}(x) denotes the largest connected subset containing x). This is obviously an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the connected components of X. Endow X/{\\sim} with the quotient topology, i.e. the finest topology making the map m:x\\mapsto \\mathrm{conn}(x) continuous. With a little bit of effort we can see that X/{\\sim} is totally disconnected. We also have the following universal property: if f : X\\rightarrow Y a continuous map to a totally disconnected space Y, then there exists a unique continuous map \\breve{f}:(X/\\sim)\\rightarrow Y with f=\\breve{f}\\circ m. ==References== * (reprint of the 1970 original, ) == See also == * Extremally disconnected space * Totally disconnected groups.
