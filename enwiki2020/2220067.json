    "text": "The Blackjacks were a professional wrestling tag team. The team consisted of Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza. After forming in the 1970s, they wrestled in a variety of professional wrestling promotions, including the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). They were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. ==History== ===The original Blackjacks=== The duo first joined forces in 1971. They were managed by Bobby Heenan. The Blackjacks won multiple tag team titles, including the WWA Tag Team Championship and two tag-team championships in WCCW. They, however, are most known for winning the WWWF Tag Team Championship (with Lou Albano as their manager) on August 26, 1975 by defeating Dominic DeNucci and Pat Barrett. On April 1, 2006, The Blackjacks were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Heenan. ===The New Blackjacks=== In early 1997, Mulligan\u2019s son, Barry Windham, and Lanza\u2019s nephew, Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw, formed The New Blackjacks in the WWF. They were known as Blackjack Windham and Blackjack Bradshaw, who originally competed as heels, but later as babyfaces it was rumored in early 1997 that they would be bodyguards for The Undertaker (for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship Run as WWE Champion). They competed in a four-way tag team match at WrestleMania 13, which was won by The Headbangers. They would then feud with The Godwinns. The team never reached the success of their predecessors and disbanded in January 1998, as Windham turned on Bradshaw. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Big Time Wrestling **NWA American Tag Team Championship (2 times) **NWA Texas Tag Team Championship (1 Time) *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2016 *World Wrestling Association **WWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) *World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment **WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) **WWWF World Tag Team Championship (1 time) ==See also== *The Acolytes Protection Agency *The Four Horsemen *The Heenan Family *The U.S. Express *The West Texas Rednecks ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *WWE Hall of Fame Profile of The Blackjacks Category:American Wrestling Association teams and stables Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:The Heenan Family members Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees Category:WWE Hall of Fame team inductees Category:WWE teams and stables Category:WWF/WWE World Tag Team Champions ",
