It is the back of a processional banner - the front showing the Coronation of the Virgin is now in the Getty Center in Los Angeles. The banner was painted for a confraternity based at the San Francesco Monastery in Fabriano, the painter's birthplace - he had returned there from Brescia for a few months in spring 1420 before moving on to Florence. Ambrogio de' Bizochis was probably the intermediary between the painter and the confraternity - he was cousin to Egidio, brother of Gentile's wifeMauro Minardi, Gentile da Fabriano, Skira, Milano 2005.. ==References== category:Paintings by Gentile da Fabriano Category:Paintings of the Magnani- Rocca Foundation category:Paintings of Francis of Assisi category:1420s paintings ",
