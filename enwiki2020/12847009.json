He began his career at a young age with a small role in the 2002 film Hilfe, ich bin ein Junge and worked sporadically, mainly focusing on his school work. In 2008, he won the starring role of Michael Berg in the critically acclaimed film The Reader. For his part, he was nominated for various awards and went on to win the Sierra Award at the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards for Youth in Film. Kross has since worked in both German and English speaking film roles, including War Horse, Race and Into the White. == Early life == Kross was born in Henstedt- Ulzburg, 20 miles north of Hamburg. He grew up in Bargteheide, where he attended Eckhorst High School until 2007. He has two brothers and one sister. He played basketball at the professional club TSV Bargteheide between 2004 and 2006. == Career == His career started with a small appearance in the 2002 film Hilfe, ich bin ein Junge (English: Help, I'm a Boy!). In December 2003, he joined Blaues W\u00f6lkchen, a small group from a children's theatre in Bargteheide. His first major theatrical appearance was in Hilfe, die Herdmanns kommen. In 2005, Kross came to the attention of Detlev Buck through his daughter, Bernadette, and he auditioned for Tough Enough (Knallhart); Buck hired Kross to play the lead, a 15-year-old boy who moves with his mother from a rich neighborhood of Berlin (Zehlendorf) to the Neukoelln area, known at the time for its high number of Turkish immigrants and high crime level. Kross not only won praise at Berlinale in 2006, but also won Best Actor in Nuremberg at the 11th Filmfestival T\u00fcrkei/Deutschland. In 2006, Kross worked again with Buck in the film ' (H\u00e4nde weg von Mississippi), playing an apprentice baker. In the fall of the same year, he started shooting a film by Marco Kreuzpaintner, Krabat (The Satanic Mill). In this version of Otfried Preu\u00dfler's children's book, Kross plays the title role, one of the apprentices of magic, with co-stars Daniel Br\u00fchl and Robert Stadlober. The film was released on 19 September 2007 in movie festivals and in October 2008 in theatres. In September 2007, The Reader began shooting in Berlin, Cologne, and G\u00f6rlitz. In Stephen Daldry's adaption of the best-selling novel by Bernhard Schlink, Kross plays the lead role of Michael Berg, opposite Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and Bruno Ganz. He had to learn to speak English to appear in the film. The world premiere was at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York on 3 December 2008. The film was presented in the 2009 Berlinale but did not compete. In May 2009, Kross was honored for his performance in The Reader at the 62nd Cannes Festival, winning the Chopard trophy. Kross was nominated for a European Film Award as best actor. His next work was in Same Same But Different (2009), again with Buck directing. The script is based on an autobiographical article by Benjamin Pr\u00fcfer. In June 2010, it was announced that Kross had been cast in Steven Spielberg's film, War Horse. Filming started in August 2010, in Dartmoor, Devon, U.K. and the film was released in December 2011. ==Personal life== In 2009, Kross started a three-year course of studies at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). His plan was to improve his acting skills and his English. However, he dropped out at the end of the same year to concentrate on films. Since then, he has been living in Berlin-Mitte. Kross has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood, preferring to reside in Germany and continue making both German and English language films. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\" !
