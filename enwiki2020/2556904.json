Fans of both clubs consider the other to be their main rivals, and the derby is considered by many to be one of the most famous and fiercest derbies in England and Europe. Although the two teams first played each other in 1887, the rivalry did not begin until 1913 when Arsenal moved their ground to north London. As of 12 July 2020, 187 games have been played between the two teams since their first game in the Football League in 1909, with 77 wins for Arsenal, 59 wins for Tottenham and 51 games drawn. When games played before the formation of the Football League are included, 200 games have been played, with Arsenal winning 82, Tottenham 65, and 53 draws. Notable matches of the North London derby include the games in which Arsenal won the league at White Hart Lane in 1971 and 2004, Tottenham beating Arsenal 5\u20130 at home in 1983 and Arsenal winning by the same score away in 1978, and Tottenham beating Arsenal 3\u20131 at the semi-final of the 1990\u201391 FA Cup, which they went on to win. The highest-scoring game in the North London derby is the 5\u20134 win by Arsenal at White Hart Lane in November 2004. The top scorers in North London derbies are Bobby Smith, Emmanuel Adebayor (who played for both clubs) and Harry Kane with 10 goals each. , Harry Kane is the top scorer in Premier League games with 10. Arsenal play their home games at the Emirates Stadium in Islington, while Tottenham Hotspur are based at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the neighbouring borough of Haringey. The two stadiums are 4 miles (6.4km) apart. Until 2006, Arsenal played their home games at the Highbury Stadium and until 2017, Tottenham used White Hart Lane before relocating temporarily to Wembley Stadium. ==History== ===Early matches=== The first meeting between the two teams was a friendly on 19 November 1887, when Arsenal were located in Plumstead (then part of Kent but now in Greater London), and known as Royal Arsenal. The match, played at the then Spurs ground at Tottenham Marshes, was abandoned 15 minutes before it was due to end \"owing to darkness\" with Spurs leading 2\u20131. The first completed match between the two teams was held the following February in Plumstead; Tottenham could only field nine players, and were thus beaten 6\u20132. Another notable match was in 1898 played at the Spurs ground at Northumberland Park. The match with the then Woolwich Arsenal was attended by a record crowd of 15,000, and the refreshment stand collapsed when spectators climbed up onto its roof in the overcrowded ground, resulting in some injuries and prompting Spurs to start looking for a new ground. The next year the club moved a short distance to what would become known as the White Hart Lane ground. The first League match between the clubs was in the First Division, on 4 December 1909; Arsenal won 1\u20130. ===Beginning of rivalry=== The traditional first kits of Arsenal (left) and Spurs (right). However, a proper rivalry between the two teams did not begin until 1913, when Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground, Plumstead to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, just four miles from Tottenham's White Hart Lane, a move resented and opposed by Tottenham as they considered Highbury their territory. The move made Arsenal Tottenham's nearest neighbours and thus began a natural local rivalry. The two teams first faced each other as \"north London\" in a War Relief Fund friendly on 22 August 1914 at White Hart Lane. Although Arsenal were in the Second Division and Tottenham in the First, Arsenal won 5\u20131. They would go on to meet regularly during World War I in the London Combination, the regional wartime competition of the time. The rivalry escalated in 1919 when, after World War I, the First Division was to be expanded by two teams, and the League held a meeting of the clubs to decide the two clubs by means of a vote. 19th-placed Chelsea, who would otherwise have been relegated, were allowed to stay and thus they took the first of the two spots. The second spot could have been awarded to 20th- placed Tottenham, or Barnsley, who had finished third in the Second Division, but Arsenal (along with four other clubs) also bid for the place, despite their only finishing sixth in Division Two, although an error in the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1980. After an endorsement by League president and chairman of Liverpool John McKenna on account of their longer membership of the League, Arsenal won the vote by eighteen votes to Spurs' eight (Barnsley got five, Wolves four, Nottingham Forest three, Birmingham two and Hull City one) and were thus elected to the First Division. The decision infuriated Tottenham and their supporters. It has been frequently alleged that Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris used underhand dealings in order to bring this about, although nothing has been proven.These allegations range from political machinations to outright bribery. A detailed account of what facts are known can be found in Tottenham themselves had been elected to join the Football League Second Division eleven years prior after finishing 7th in the 1907\u201308 Southern League, but it involved entirely separate leagues that did not have automatic right to move between them. Tottenham were initially unsuccessful in their attempt to join the Football League, and only narrowly won election to the Second Division after Stoke resigned from the league for financial reasons. Despite the setback, Tottenham were soon promoted back into the top flight after taking the 1919\u201320 Second Division title, and the derby was once again regularly contested. The first fully competitive derby match after Arsenal's 1913 move to north London was a First Division match that finished 2\u20131 to Tottenham, on 15 January 1921 at White Hart Lane. The early matches between the two were noted for their bitterness - a particularly vicious match in September 1922 led to both clubs being censured by the Football Association and threatened with being forced to play behind closed doors. Tottenham played in the Second Division between the periods of 1928 and 1933, as well as 1935 to 1950, which naturally led to a drop in the number of matches between the two clubs in this period and a cooling of passions. In 1935 Arsenal registered its highest ever win over Spurs in a 6-0 rout away at White Hart Lane. This 6-0 result remains the biggest win by any team wherein the derby. Relations between the two clubs improved somewhat after the Second World War, after Tottenham allowed Arsenal to play their home matches at White Hart Lane while Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station and subsequently bombed. The two sides met in the FA Cup for the first time in the 1948\u201349 season, when Arsenal won a third round tie 3\u20130. ===1950\u2013present=== Kick-off for the second half at the north London derby, 20 November 2010. Arsenal were 2\u20130 up at this point, but were beaten 3\u20132. Since 1950, there has only been one season being that of (1977\u201378) where Spurs and Arsenal have not been in the same division, meaning fixtures between the two are regular. With being so, this has maintained the rivalry to the present day; there have been many notable matches. Several of these comprise those where the course of a title or the journey to a cup final has relied upon the outcome of a derby match. As with any major football rivalry, gloating and banter between the two sets of fans, many of whom work and even live together, is commonplace. Players who transfer between the two teams receive a bad reception from their former fans; an example was defender Sol Campbell, who was nicknamed \"Judas\" by Spurs fans after he crossed the divide in 2001. Arsenal's Theo Walcott and William Gallas of Tottenham in the North London Derby of November 2012 which the Gunners won 5\u20132. Arsenal's Theo Walcott, after picking up a knee injury in the 83rd minute of a FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham in January 2014, was pelted with a hail of coins and plastic bottles whilst coming off the field on a stretcher by Tottenham fans at the Emirates Stadium. Walcott subsequently made a gesture on the stretcher to the Spurs fans which reflected, at that point in time, the 2-0 scoreline of the game which it finished as eventually. An investigation was eventually made with regard to the perpetrators of the incident by the authorities. On 30 April 2017, Tottenham beat Arsenal 2-0 in the final North London Derby at White Hart Lane. This result guaranteed Tottenham finishing above the Gunners in the league for the first time in 22 years. Arsenal fans have a celebration day related to the north London rivalry called St. Totteringham's Day, which is the day in the season when Tottenham cannot mathematically finish above Arsenal on the league table. Spurs fans had long before declared 14 April to be St. Hotspur day in honour of Spurs' 3\u20131 win over Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final. St. Hotspur Day was also celebrated on 14 April 2010, when Spurs beat Arsenal 2\u20131. ==Fans== 2009\u201310 Premier League at White Hart Lane. The home fans are singing to Sol Campbell. He had been targeted by Tottenham fans since he had moved from Spurs to their north London rivals in 2001. Both Spurs' and Arsenal's fan bases are multi-ethnic, due to the racial diversity in London. In 2002, Arsenal had 7.7% of their fans calling themselves non-white British, rising to 14% in 2008, the highest in the league in these fans surveys. Around 9% of Tottenham fans were non-White in 2008. Both clubs also have extensive fan bases throughout the UK and the rest of the world. Arsenal fans call themselves \"Gooners\", a term that is derived from the club's nickname \"Gunners\", which is itself a reference to Arsenal's origins as a munitions factory team. Spurs fans call themselves \"yids\". Due to the historical support from the Jewish communities in North and East London, Tottenham once had a significant number of Jewish fans; it was estimated that around 10,000 or a third of the club's fans in the 1930s were Jewish. Due to this historical association, fans of many other clubs from the 1960s onwards have directed antisemitic chants at Spurs fans. Tottenham no longer has a greater number of Jewish fans than other major London clubs such as Arsenal (Jewish support for Arsenal started to increase in the 1930s); an estimate put the number of Jewish fans at Tottenham as at most 5%, about the same number as Arsenal, but the antisemitic chants against Tottenham fans persisted. In an attempt to draw the sting from these chants, Spurs fans (whether Jewish or not) adopted the words \"yid\" and \"yiddo\" for themselves and thereby turned a pejorative into a term of pride and belonging. There is, however, still some controversy over the use of \"yid\" or \"yiddo\". A 2003 online survey found that Arsenal supporters most dislike Tottenham, and that Tottenham fans see Arsenal as their main rival. ==Results== ===Premier League=== ====Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !

These include: *Tottenham 0\u20131 Arsenal (3 May 1971) The final match of the 1970\u201371 league campaign, with Arsenal needing a win or a goalless draw to take the First Division title (a score draw would have meant Leeds United won on goal average). The game was tight with few real chances on goal, until the very end. With three minutes to go, John Radford's shot forced Pat Jennings into a good save; George Armstrong got to the rebound and chipped the ball across goal and Ray Kennedy headed home the winner. Spurs desperately tried to get a goal back but to no avail; Arsenal held on to win the title (the first half of the Double that season). *Tottenham 1\u20132 Arsenal (4 March 1987) Arsenal and Spurs had drawn 2\u20132 on aggregate in the League Cup semi-finals; with no away goals rule in force, the match was replayed at Spurs' home ground of White Hart Lane. Spurs went 1\u20130 up through Clive Allen but Arsenal substitute Ian Allinson equalised and David Rocastle scrambled home the winner to send Arsenal through to the Final, where they won their first trophy since 1979. *Tottenham 3\u20131 Arsenal (14 April 1991 at Wembley) \u2013 The first FA Cup semi- final between the two sides. Arsenal were chasing a second Double, but Tottenham's Paul Gascoigne scored after just five minutes with a free kick from 30 yards out. Gary Lineker made it two, and although Alan Smith pulled one back for the Gunners before half-time, Lineker scored again in the second half to seal the result. Arsenal's Double dream was dashed, though they still won the League that season; Spurs lifted the Cup a month later. Known as St Hotspur Day for Tottenham fans. *Arsenal 1\u20130 Tottenham (4 April 1993 at Wembley) The second FA Cup semi-final between the two, in which Arsenal sought revenge over their North London rivals for the 3\u20131 semi-final defeat two years earlier. Tony Adams scored with a header from a Paul Merson free kick for the Gunners in the 79th minute; Arsenal prevailed despite Lee Dixon's sending-off, and went on to win the FA Cup in May and complete the first ever domestic cup double. *Arsenal 2\u20131 Tottenham (8 April 2001 at Old Trafford) The third FA Cup semi-final between the two. Gary Doherty gave Spurs the lead, before Patrick Vieira equalised for Arsenal. Robert Pires scored a second half winner to send Arsenal through to the first FA Cup final to be played outside England, where they lost 2\u20131 to Liverpool in Cardiff. *Tottenham 2\u20132 Arsenal (25 April 2004) Arsenal were unbeaten in the Premier League and only needed a point to secure the title. The Gunners were 2\u20130 up after 35 minutes thanks to Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires' goals. A famous win looked to be on the cards, but Spurs restored some pride by denying Arsenal victory; in the second half Jamie Redknapp scored from long-range, then Robbie Keane converted a 90th-minute penalty to earn the draw. Arsenal thus won the title at their rivals' home ground for the second time (it was, as of 2020, their last title). *Arsenal 3\u20131 Tottenham a.e.t (31 January 2007) Arsenal booked their place in the 2007 League Cup Final, for the first time since winning the competition in 1993, after this extra-time victory. The teams drew the first leg 2\u20132 at White Hart Lane where Tottenham threw away a 2\u20130 first half lead, eventually drawing the game.
