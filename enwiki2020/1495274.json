    "text": "Die Chinesische Mauer is Michael Cretu's third solo album, released in 1985. The literal English translation of the title is \"The Chinese Wall\", or as it is better known, \"The Great Wall of China\". Like his previous album, this had German lyrics, was sung by Michael, and was co-produced by Armand Volker. This album was also released as a separate album with English lyrics and a different track listing under the name \"The Invisible Man\". Several of the tracks on \"The Invisible Man\" were edited slightly, and, therefore last for a different length than the German versions on Die Chinesische Mauer. The song \"Samurai\" was released as a single and became a hit in Europe (#1 Greece, #2 Switzerland, #4 Italy, #4 Sweden, #12 Germany). In 1986, after the success of the single \"Gambit\" the English version of the album was re-released to feature this song. ==Track listing== ===Die Chinesische Mauer (German edition)=== # \"Intro\" (Cretu) - 2:28 # \"Mikado\" (Cretu) - 3:17 # \"Coda\" (Cretu) - 0:59 # \"Amazonen\" (Cretu, Killer) - 5:19 # \"Die Chinesische Mauer\" (Cretu, Killer) - 5:01 # \"Samurai\" (Cretu, Killer) - 5:22 # \"Carte Blanche\" (Cretu, Killer) - 3:56 # \"Schwarzer Engel\" (Cretu, Killer) - 5:18 # \"Zinnsoldat\" (Cretu, Killer) - 3:24 ===The Invisible Man (English edition)=== All tracks written by Michael Cretu and Richard Palmer-James; except where indicated # \"Did You Ever Dream\" - 5:13 - Samurai # \"Ride on with the Breeze\" - 3:24 - Carte Blanche # \"Silver Water\" - 4:42 - Schwarzer Engel # \"Your Favorite Toy\" - 3:26 - Zinnsoldat # \"Intro\" (Cretu, Cretu) - 2:27 # \"Mikado\" (Cretu, Cretu) - 3:14 # \"Coda\" (Cretu, Cretu) - 0:59 # \"Heavy Traffic\" - 4:57 - Amazonen # \"The Invisible Man\" - 5:01 - Die chinesische Mauer ===The Invisible Man (English edition re-release)=== # \"Gambit\" - 4:35 # \"Did You Ever Dream\" - 5:13 # \"Silver Water\" - 4:40 # \"Your Favorite Toy\" - 3:24 # \"Intro\" - 2:28 # \"Mikado\" - 3:13 # \"Coda\" - 0:59 # \"Heavy Traffic\" - 4:54 # \"The Invisible Man\" - 5:01 ==Personnel== *Mats Bjorklund \u2013 guitar *Peter Cornelius \u2013 guitar *Curt Cress \u2013 percussion, drums *Michael Cr\u00e9tu \u2013 keyboards, vocals, producer, electric drums, drum programming *Christian Felke \u2013 saxophone *Mike Schmidt \u2013 artwork *Armand Volker \u2013 producer Category:1985 albums Category:Michael Cretu albums Category:Virgin Records albums ",
