In the 1870s its eastern and northern slopes were planted with trees by Sir Edmund Buckley, the lord of the manor of Mawddwy. On the northern flank is Llyn Foel Dinas, a lake which was damed to form a reservoir, providing the water supply to Buckley's manor house in Dinas Mawddwy. == References == Category:Mawddwy Category:Mountains and hills of Gwynedd Category:Mountains and hills of Snowdonia Category:Dyfi Hills ",
