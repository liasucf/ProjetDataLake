    "text": "The Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize is an American national and international award established by the United States National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in October 1999 in Athens. Named after Fritz Russ, the founder of Systems Research Laboratories, and his wife Dolores Russ, it recognizes a bioengineering achievement that \"has had a significant impact on society and has contributed to the advancement of the human condition through widespread use\". The award was instigated at the request of Ohio University to honor Fritz Russ, one of its alumni. The first Russ Prize was awarded in 2001 to Earl E. Bakken and Wilson Greatbatch. The prize is awarded biennially in odd years. From 2003-2011 there was a single winner per award. Multiple winners were recognized starting in 2013. The first non-Americans to receive the Russ Prize were three of the five co-winners honored in 2015. Only living persons may receive the prize, and recipients of the Charles Stark Draper Prize are not also eligible for the Russ Prize. Members of the NAE and non- members worldwide are able to receive the award. The winners are announced during National Engineers Week in February. They receive US$500,000, a gold medallion and a hand-scribed certificate. The Russ Prize, the Gordon Prize and the Draper Prize, all awarded by the NAE, are known collectively as the \"Nobel Prizes of Engineering\". ==Recipients== Earl E. Bakken was one of the first persons, along with Wilson Greatbatch, who received the Russ Prize. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! width=50 style=\"background:#FFA54F;\"|Year ! width=150 style=\"background:#FFA54F;\"|Recipient(s) ! class=unsortable width=100 style=\"background:#FFA54F;\"| Nationality ! class=unsortable width=320 style=\"background:#FFA54F;\"| Reason ! class=unsortable width=80 style=\"background:#FFA54F;\"|Reference |- | 2001 | and | US | \"for their independent development of the implantable cardiac pacemaker\" | |- | 2003 | | US | \"for his pioneering work on artificial organs, beginning with the artificial kidney, thus launching a new field that is benefiting the lives of millions\" | |- | 2005 | | US | \"for bioengineering membrane-based sensors in medical, food, and environmental applications\" | |- | 2007 | | US | \"for the characterization and modeling of human tissue mechanics and function leading to prevention and mitigation of trauma\" | |- | 2009 | | US | \"for pioneering the engineering and commercialization of biological systems for large-scale manufacturing of antibiotics and other drugs\" | |- | 2011 | | US | \"for automating DNA sequencing that revolutionized biomedicine and forensic science\" | |- | 2013 | , and | US | \"for the development of laser ablative decomposition, enabling LASIK and PRK eye surgery\" | |- | 2015 | , , , , and | Australia, Austria, Austria, US, US | \"for engineering cochlear implants that enable the deaf to hear\" | |- |2017 |James G.
