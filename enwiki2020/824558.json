On 7 July 1999, in Roma, Ngeny was second to Hicham El Guerrouj when the latter set the world record (3:43.13) for the mile run. Ngeny stayed close to El Guerrouj down the stretch to finish at 3:43.40, still the second-fastest mile ever run , and almost a full second inside the old world record (3:44.39) of Noureddine Morceli.YouTube video: Hicham El Guerrouj sets a world record in the mile On 24 August 1999, Ngeny took the 1500 m silver medal (3:28.73) in the IAAF 1999 World Championships in Athletics in Seville, Spain, behind the reigning world champion El Guerrouj (3:27.65).YouTube video 1500 m final\u2013 1999 World Championships On 5 September 1999, Ngeny set the world record 2:11.96 over 1000 m in Rieti, Italy, breaking the 18-years-standing record 2:12.18 set by Sebastian Coe in 1981. Ngeny's time of 2:11.96 still stands as the world record with only one other runner coming within 2 seconds of the time since (Taoufik Makhloufi).YouTube video: Noah Ngeny runs 1000 meter world record The previous record had been the oldest standing record at the time. It was also the last world record of any running distance that had not been previously held by an athlete of African descent. In 1999 Ngeny recorded six sub 3:30 clockings for 1500 m and established himself as the closest rival to world champion and world record holder El Guerrouj. On 11 August 2000, Ngeny finished second to El Guerrouj (3:27.21) in the 1500 m at the Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich meet in a time of 3:28.12, making him the Kenyan record holder and third-fastest ever in the event. This record was surpassed by Bernard Lagat's 3:26.34 in Bruxelles on 24 August 2001. Lagat achieved this record when he finished 2nd behind Hicham El Guerrouj (3:26.12). ===Sydney triumph=== On 29 September 2000, at the 1500 m final of 2000 Sydney Olympics, El Guerrouj, world record holder and twice world champion, had only been defeated once since the previous Olympics, and was the overwhelming favourite. The two rivals led the race going into the last lap of the final, El Guerrouj leading Ngeny. With less than 100 m to go, Ngeny started moving next to the leader, grabbing the lead with just 15 m to go. He held on until the finish line, causing one of the greatest upsets at the Sydney Olympics.Guardian El Guerrouj, a picture of despairsporting- heroes.net Noah Ngeny Olympic gold at 1500 metres of 2000 Sydney Olympics2000 Sydney Olympics 2000 Sydney Olympics News \u2013 IAAF In the process, Ngeny set an Olympic record of 3:32.07, surpassing Sebastian Coe's Olympic record of 3:32.53, set in 1984. El Guerrouj settled for silver in 3:32.32 and Ngeny's compatriot Bernard Lagat, another Kenyan runner at that time, later a US citizen, took bronze in 3:32.44. Ngeny became the third Kenyan to win the 1500 m crown following Kip Keino (1968 Mexico City Olympics) and Peter Rono (1988 Seoul Olympics). The year 2000 was the highlight of Ngeny's running career. He posted career bests of 1:44.49 for 800 m (28 July 2000 in Oslo) and 3:28.12 for 1500 m (at the Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich on 11 August 2000), en route to his Olympic triumph (29 September 2000). As of October 2019, his career best time of 3:28.12 at Z\u00fcrich makes him the sixth-fastest 1500 m runner of all time, behind El Guerrouj, Lagat, Noureddine Morceli, Silas Kiplagat and Asbel Kiprop. ===After Sydney=== Ngeny was dropped from the Kenyan team for the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton after defying instructions from the national federation to return home from Britain where he trains.2001 WC Ngeny axed from Kenya squad Ngeny returned to Australia in 2001 to win the Goodwill Games Mile in Brisbane.
