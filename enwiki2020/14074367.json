    "text": "Gerard van Spaendonck (22 March 1746 \u2013 11 May 1822) was a Dutch painter. ==Life== Gerard was born in Tilburg, an older brother of Cornelis van Spaendonck (1756\u20131840), who was also an accomplished artist. In the 1760s he studied with decorative painter Willem Jacob Herreyns (also known as Guillaume-Jacques Herreyns) (1743\u20131827) in Antwerp. In 1769 he moved to Paris, where in 1774 he was appointed miniature painter in the court of Louis XVI. In 1780 he succeeded Madeleine Fran\u00e7oise Basseporte (1701\u20131780) as professor of floral painting at the Jardin des Plantes, and shortly afterwards was elected as a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts. Among his pupils were Pierre- Joseph Redout\u00e9 and Henriette Vincent. Gerard van Spaendonck painted with both oil and watercolors. He contributed over fifty works to Les V\u00e9lins du Roi, a famous collection of botanical watercolors possessed by French royalty. From 1799 to 1801 he published twenty-four plates of Fleurs Dessinees d'apres Nature (Flowers Drawn from Life), which were high-quality engravings for students of floral painting. Today, Spaendonck's Fleurs Dessin\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s Nature is a highly treasured book on floral art. In 1788 he was appointed adviser to the Acad\u00e9mie, and in 1795 became a founding member of the Institut de France. In 1804 he received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and soon afterwards was ennobled by Napoleon Bonaparte. Spaendonck died in Paris in 1822 and is buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. == Gallery == Image:Gerard Van Spaendonck - Bouquet.jpg|Bouquet of tulips, roses and an opium poppies, with a pale clouded yellow butterfly, a red longhorn beetle and a sevenspotted ladybug Image:Gerard Van Spaendonck - Still Life.jpg|Still life of flowers in a basket with two butterflies, a dragonfly, a fly and a beetle near an alabaster urn on a marble pedestal Image:Gerard Van Spaendonck - Jacinthe.jpg|Jacinthe double.
