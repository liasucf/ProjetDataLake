    "text": "The New Record by My Bloody Valentine is the second EP by the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine, released in September 1986 on Kaleidoscope Sound. Recorded at Alaska Studios in London, the EP's sound is influenced by C86, a brand of indie pop, and diverges from the band's earlier post-punk sound. Allmusic writer Nitsuh Abebe has called The New Record by My Bloody Valentine \"a vital point in the development of [the band's] sound\" and referred to it as \"the point at which the band started to experiment with pop music and noise\", influenced by The Jesus and Mary Chain. Upon its release, The New Record by My Bloody Valentine peaked at number 22 in the UK Independent Singles Chart. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All personnel credits adapted from The New Record by My Bloody Valentines liner notes. ;My Bloody Valentine *David Conway \u2013 vocals *Kevin Shields \u2013 guitar, vocals *Debbie Googe \u2013 bass *Colm \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig \u2013 drums ;Technical personnel *My Bloody Valentine \u2013 production *Joe Foster \u2013 production *Steve Nunn \u2013 engineering *Pete Peterson \u2013 photography ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Singles Chart | 22 |} ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * * Category:1986 EPs Category:My Bloody Valentine (band) EPs Category:Albums produced by Slaughter Joe ",
