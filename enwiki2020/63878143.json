Konow was very skeptical of diplomacy.Iver B. Neumann og Halvard Leira Aktiv og avventende. Utenrikstjenestens liv 1905\u20132005 Oslo: Pax, 2005. s. 179. In 1906 he would prefer to have a unitary service in which diplomacy, consulate and ministry were coordinated. The rest of the Liberal Party opposed this radical claim and pointed to Sweden whom still kept the ministry, consulate and diplomacy separate.

In political context, he is often referred to as Wollert Konow (H) or Wollert Konow (KH).
