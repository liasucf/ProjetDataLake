    "text": "\"Powerglide\" is a single by American hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd. It was released on March 1, 2018 by EarDrummers and Interscope Records as the third single from their third studio album SR3MM (2018). The song is written by Aaquil Brown, Khalif Brown, Jordan Houston, Jamal Rashid, Jean-Marie Horvat and Michael Williams and is produced by the latter three. The song features guest vocals from American rapper Juicy J (although he is notably cut from the radio edit). ==Background== The song was released alongside two other singles from SR3MM, Swae Lee's \"Hurt to Look\" and Slim Jxmmi's \"Brxnks Truck\", on March 1, 2018. The album is a triple-disc album featuring SR3MM and solo albums from Rae Sremmurd members Swae Lee, titled Swaecation, and Slim Jxmmi, titled Jxmtro. The song samples Three 6 Mafia's \"Side 2 Side\", featuring Mafia member Juicy J. They were able to get Juicy J involved after a run-in at a party. Juicy expressed an interest in collaboration and went to the studio. He sent his part back, and as Swae says, \"wrecked it.\" ==Music video== A music video for \"Powerglide\" was released on March 12, 2018. In the visual, the rappers perform the track up on a parking structure rooftop as cars burn rubber, do donuts and get \"lit up\" by overhead helicopters. Producer Mike Will Made It makes a cameo appearance in the video. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Khalif Brown \u2013 composition * Aaquil Brown \u2013 composition * Jordan Houston \u2013 composition * Jamal Rashid \u2013 composition, production * Jean-Marie Horvat \u2013 composition, production * Michael Williams \u2013 composition, production, mixing * Jaycen Joshua \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 74 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseeker (RMNZ) | 8 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) | 83 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 97 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 51 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rhythmic (Billboard) | 49 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:Rae Sremmurd songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Swae Lee Category:Songs written by Juicy J Category:Song recordings produced by Mike Will Made It Category:Songs written by Aaquil Brown Category:Songs written by Mike Will Made It ",
