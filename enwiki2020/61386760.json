The champions of S\u00e9rie A and S\u00e9rie B would qualify into the Finals, while the last-placed team in S\u00e9rie B would dispute a playoff against the champions of the Second Level. *Final stage: However, before the Finals, the champions of S\u00e9rie B would have to play against the last-placed team of S\u00e9rie A. If they won that match, they qualified for the Finals while the other team would be relegated to the S\u00e9rie B. In case of any other result, the S\u00e9rie A champions would win the title automatically, and no relegation or promotion across groups would take place. ==Championship== ===S\u00e9rie A=== ===S\u00e9rie B=== ===Final phase=== Vasco da Gama eliminated; Am\u00e9rica declared champions ===Final standings=== ===Relegation playoffs=== Originally, a playoff would be held between Mackenzie, the last-placed team in S\u00e9rie B and River, the champions of the Second Level. However, LMDT decided to expand the championship to 16 teams for 1923, eliminating the need for a playoff. ==References== Category:Campeonato Carioca seasons Carioca ",
