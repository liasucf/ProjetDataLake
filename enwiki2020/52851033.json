Bellin College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (HLC). ==History== Bellin College was founded as Deaconess Sanitarium Training School for Nurses in 1909 by Dr. Julius Bellin. The school was created to train nurses for Dr. Bellin's Deaconess Santarium and other Green Bay, Wisconsin hospitals. In 1928, the college's name was changed to Bellin Memorial Training School after the death of Dr. Bellin. In 1930, the college began a partnership with Milwaukee Children's Hospital, giving nursing students experience with the children's hospital. In 1953, the college became fully accredited. The same year, the college closed its doors for two years due to a nursing instructor shortage. In 1975, the college remained as the only registered nursing college in northeastern Wisconsin. In 2009, the college's name was changed to Bellin College, coinciding with their move to their new campus in Bellevue, Wisconsin. In 2015, Bellin College completed an expansion that included four simulation rooms to provide students hospital-like experiences. ==Academic programs== There are over 370 students enrolled in education programs at Bellin College.
