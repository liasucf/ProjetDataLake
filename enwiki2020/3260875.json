    "text": "The collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu) is a species of mammal in the family Tayassuidae found in North, Central, and South America. They are commonly referred to as javelina, sa\u00edno, or b\u00e1quiro, although these terms are also used to describe other species in the family. The species is also known as the musk hog. In Trinidad, it is colloquially known as quenk. Although somewhat related to the pigs and frequently referred to as one, this species and the other peccaries are no longer classified in the pig family, Suidae. ==Description== Dentition, as illustrated in Knight's Sketches in Natural History The collared peccary stands around tall at the shoulder and is about long. It weighs between . The dental formula is: 2/3,1/1,3/3,3/3. The collared peccary has small tusks that point toward the ground when the animal is upright. It also has slender legs with a robust or stocky body. The tail is often hidden in the coarse fur of the peccary. ==Range and habitat== The collared peccary is a widespread creature found throughout much of the tropical and subtropical Americas, ranging from the Southwestern United States to northern Argentina in South America. They have been reintroduced to Uruguay in 2017, after 100 years of extinction. The only Caribbean island where it is native, however, is Trinidad. It was once and until fairly recently also extant on the nearby island of Tobago, but is now exceedingly rare (if not locally extirpated) due to overhunting by humans. It inhabits deserts and xeric shrublands, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, flooded grasslands and savannas, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, and several other habitats, as well. In addition, it is well adapted to habitats shared by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover; they can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range, where they consume garden plants. Notable populations are known to exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. ==Diet== Collared peccaries are omnivorous. They normally feed on cactus, mesquite beans, fruits, roots, tubers, palm nuts, grasses, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. In areas inhabited by humans, they also consume cultivated crops and ornamental plants, such as tulip bulbs. ==Behaviour== Collared peccaries are diurnal creatures that live in groups of up to 50 individuals, averaging between six and 9 members. They sleep in burrows, often under the roots of trees, but sometimes can be found in caves or under logs. However, collared peccaries are not completely diurnal. In central Arizona, they are often active at night, but less so in daytime. Although they usually ignore humans, they will react if they feel threatened. They defend themselves with their tusks. A collared peccary can release a strong musk or give a sharp bark if it is alarmed. ==Gallery== File:Collared peccaries as seen by a fixed camera in Scottsdale, Arizona.webm|A herd seen by a fixed camera in Scottsdale, Arizona File:Running Javelina.jpg|Running collared peccary File:Mother javelina and baby.jpg|Mother and juvenile File:Ancestral Pueblo, Roosevelt black on white javelina effigy canteen, 1250-1300 CE, Heard Museum.JPG|A Pueblo drinking vessel ==References== ==External links== * Smithsonian Institution - North American Mammals: Pecari tajacu * Smithsonian Wild: Pecari tajacu *Arizona Game and Fish Department \u2013 Living With Javelina Peccary, Collared Category:Mammals of the United States Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Peccary, Collared Category:Mammals described in 1758 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
