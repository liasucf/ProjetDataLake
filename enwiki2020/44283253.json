Then he added, 'on the show'.\" Stephen Downie branded Ryan \"a mysterious peeping Tom\" and added \"we get the vibe he doesn't seem like the sort of guy who'll settle for an autograph.\" After arriving in Summer Bay, Ryan goes to the diner and tells Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) that he is in the Bay to meet a girl. He spots Phoebe Nicholson and tells Roo that he is a fan of hers. He follows Phoebe home and watches her from the bushes.

Details about her casting and character were released on 21 April 2015. Of joining the cast, De Josselin said \"I was super chuffed.

Mason commented, \"Billie is the only family Ash has left, and he feels they need to make amends now he's out of jail.\" Describing Billie, de Josselin said \"Billie's super upfront and sometimes lacks a social filter.\" Billie and Ash were reunited at their brother Luke's graveside on Anzac Day.

It feels like the perfect timing, the perfect role and the character is going to be a lot of fun to play.\" Charlotte is a biology teacher, who joined the staff at the local high school. She later explained that Charlotte comes to Summer Bay for a fresh start, something that Haynatz related to, but would be hiding \"a secret history\". Debbie Schipp for news.com.au commented that Charlotte would not have a low key arrival, while Heynatz added \"there's no slinking into the show in the background \u2013 she definitely makes an entrance.\" The character was killed off by Josh Barrett in the season finale on 9 December 2015. ==James Edmunds== James Edmunds, played by Myles Pollard, made his first screen appearance on 9 July 2015. Pollard's casting was announced in March 2015. He previously appeared in Home and Away in 2007 as Dane Jordans. Of his workload this time around, Pollard said \"The amount of scripts you have to learn daily is quite full on and also for me, playing a doctor and an academic, you have lots of exposition in the writing and a lot of that is jargon driven; lots of big words and only one or two takes to make it work.\" Myles Pollard played James Edmunds. James is a doctor and an associate professor. He was introduced as a love interest for established character Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker). Pollard explained that James was more of a challenge to play than Dane and would play an integral part in Roo's storyline. He commented, \"He's an intelligent character and really cares for Roo and her family, he really values that relationship. He's more of a protagonist too, so he's driving the story more than the other character I played. It's more responsibility, which is nice.\" Emma Bergmeier-Varian from The West Australian described James as \"charming and affable\" and reported that he has a dark past, an aspect of the character Pollard enjoyed playing. He said that James had good intentions, but was flawed and complicated. James comes to The Diner looking for his former school friend Roo Stewart, after they ran into each other at a conference. He offers her a teaching job at the university, before revealing that he is moving back to Summer Bay, as he has found work at the hospital. On Roo's first day at the university, James wishes her luck and later invites her out for coffee. They get on well and discuss their teaching methods. Roo then invites James to Casey Braxton's naming ceremony. They later go out on a proper date, but Roo acts strangely, prompting James to leave early. When he learns that she was nervous and had received some bad dating advice from her friends, he kisses her and they begin dating. They attend a dinner with Roo's friends and her father, Alf (Ray Meagher), who takes a dislike to James. James starts work at the local hospital and treats both Katarina Chapman (Pia Miller) and Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons). James asks Roo and Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) to move in with him. James tells Roo that his parents will be attending their house warming party, but he later tells her they cannot make it. Maddy becomes suspicions of James when she learns he has two phones, while Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith) remembers seeing him at the university with a young girl she assumed was his daughter. James proposes to Roo and she accepts. They try to get married quickly, but Alf stops the wedding after learning that there is no record of James having worked at the Blue Mountains Hospital. James assures Roo that he simply went by his middle name instead. James suffers burn injuries when he tries to stop an aerosol can from being thrown into a fire. At the hospital, Roo comes face to face with his wife Megan (Sophie Gregg) and learns that they have two children. James apologises for lying and Roo ends their engagement, but continues the relationship. After James admits that his parents are actually dead, she breaks up with him and tells him to get help. ==Hunter King== Hunter King, played by Scott Lee, made his first screen appearance on 27 July 2015. Lee's casting was revealed when he appeared alongside the cast at the Logie Awards in May 2015. The role marks Lee's acting debut and he called it \"very exciting\". Lee described his character as being \"angsty, brooding and moody\". He added that Hunter would cause some trouble between some of the established couples within Summer Bay. Hunter is the son of Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz) and he follows her to the Bay, so he can finally meet his father Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen). In 2016, Lee confirmed that he would be leaving the show at the end of 2017 to pursue his acting career in the United States. Lee stated, \"I'm excited. The times I've had has gone so quickly and I've learnt a lot as an actor.\" ==Tank Snelgrove== Wayne \"Tank\" Snelgrove, played by Reece Milne, made his first screen appearance on 9 September 2015. Milne originally auditioned for the role of Hunter King, but Scott Lee was cast instead. One month later he was offered the role of Tank. Milne described his character as \"every bad boy cliche rolled into one\" and \"cunning\". He said Tank would have secrets, which intrigues Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast), who meets him on the beach. Tank departed the show in October 2015, but returned in April 2016. He was romantically linked into a relationship with Skye Peters, who is a friend of his ex-girlfriend, Evelyn. Tank departed on 2 June 2016 with Skye. Tank accidentally bumps into Evelyn MacGuire on the beach. He apologises and tells her that he will see her around. They later run into each other at Angelo's and Tank asks Evie for her number. They later meet up for a date at the beach. Evie's ex-boyfriend, Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) notices Tank and Evie together, and he tries to warn Evie off him. Tank and Evie spend more time together and consummate their relationship, but they forget to use protection. After spending the evening at his place, Evie questions Tank's commitment to her, after a comment from one of his friends.

At Maddy's 18th birthday party Tank wants to meet up with Evie but she doesn't want to leave the party so Tank brings a lot of his mates to Maddy's party. They then trash the place leading one of them throwing an aerosol can into the fire which explodes and James Edmunds gets hurt. Leah and Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen) forbid Evie to see Tank. One night he sneaks into Evie's room and stays the night but is seen by VJ Patterson (Matt Little) as he leaves off the roof the following morning. Evie gets into trouble and Tank convinces her to runaway with him. They do and Evie's family is worried about where they are. Tank becomes aggressive and scares Evie who wants to leave but is prevented. She uses Tank's phone to send a map of where she is to Josh. Tank catches her and Evie runs away into the bush. Tank chases after her and Josh goes to the location of the map. He guesses that Evie is in the bush and it is confirmed by Tank's shouts that he will find her. Josh goes into the bush and finds her and brings her back home. He leaves Evie at home and tells her he will visit her that evening but while leaving the caravan park Tank runs up behind him and punches him in the back of the head leaving him unconscious and in a coma for a long time. Tank plants a fake note saying there is a bomb in his father's office and the HSC exam is stopped and the school is evacuated.

They are found by police and Tank is arrested over the bomb hoax and Josh's punch. A few months later, Greg learns Zac was in prison with Tank and that his son saved Zac when he was stabbed by a group of prisoners.

VJ catches them kissing and Tank leaves. At the beach, Tank tells Skye that he thought that he and Evie would be together forever and Skye realises that he still loves Evie. Josh confronts Tank and tells him to stay from them. Josh's older brother, Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) also threatens Tank. Skye apologises for telling Evie about his feelings for her, and they continue to spend time together. Tank decides to attend a hospital fundraiser at the Caravan Park, but Andy Barrett follows him and they fight. They knock over some gas canisters, which are then ignited by a loose wire and cause an explosion, which kills Oscar and his aunt, Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth). Andy later finds an injured Tank wandering on the road and he is taken to the hospital. Tank is questioned by the police about the explosion and tells Skye that he caused the explosion that killed Oscar. Skye is furious and ends her friendship with Tank. Everyone finds out that Tank caused the explosion and Zac attacks Tank. Greg knows Tank wasn't responsible and knows that his son was trying to protect someone.

Mingay described Trystan as \"a dark and shady character\", while The Daily Telegraph's Matt Bamford commented that he was \"tempestuous\" and would cause trouble in Summer Bay. Mingay later told Gavin Scott from TV Week that he relished the chance to play a villain, as he had mostly portrayed funny characters before. He commented, \"The go-to for a lot of guys portraying villains is to be scary, but I tried to be a bit more calculating.\" He also branded his character \"a shark in a suit\", as he is well turned out. The actor revealed that Trystan would be interacting with Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz), saying that would cause \"a massive headache\" for her.
