    "text": "World's Most Amazing Videos is a reality television series that showcases accidents, disasters, police chases and other extraordinary events that were caught on video camera. Originally, the show was produced for NBC, mainly to fill time when other shows were cancelled. Until 2007, all episodes of the show were narrated by Stacy Keach. From that point on, the season was narrated by Erik Thompson. The show was broadcast in the UK on Bravo and Channel One, in which David Wartnaby served as the narrator of the first season followed by Lee Boardman in the second season of broadcast and was expected to return in 2012. In Australia, it is shown on the pay-TV channel FOX8. The series was given its own local name titled Global Shockers for the Philippines market and it was hosted by Johnny Delgado. The fifth and final season changed the format; instead of multiple random clips in one episode, each episode now focuses on a certain theme. ==Synopsis== These videos normally show anybody involved in these aforementioned incidents surviving nonetheless. Although it is similar in content to other series like Real TV and Maximum Exposure, it took a more serious tone. The clips shows some dangerous disasters, daring rescues, fights, amateur sports, robberies, animal attacks, and car accidents. ==Season 1 (1999)== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Episode No. !
