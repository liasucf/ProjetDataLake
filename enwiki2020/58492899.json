    "text": "Joan, Lady John Campbell (c.1775 - 22 January 1828), formerly Joan (or Joanna) Glassel(l), was an American-born Scottish heiress who was the second wife of John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll, and the mother of the 8th Duke. Joan was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, the only daughter of John Glassel who had emigrated from Longniddry; some accounts say she was born in Longniddry after his return. Glassel was a member of a Lowland Scots family,G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume I, page 211. and his wife, the former Helen Buchan, was also Scottish. Glassel owned extensive property in Virginia, which he signed over to his brother at the beginning of the American Revolution, returning with his wife and daughter to Scotland. Joan married the future duke in 1820, when he was known as Lord John Campbell. He had previously been divorced from his first wife Elizabeth, whom he had married against the wishes of his father in 1802. Lord and Lady Campbell had three children: * John Henry Campbell, Earl of Campbell (1821-1837) * George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll (1823-1900), who was married three times and had children * Lady Emma Augusta Campbell (1825-1893), who married Rt. Hon. Sir John McNeill on 26 August 1870. After Joan's death in 1828, Argyll married a third time, to Anne Monteith, a widow and the eldest daughter of John Cuninghame; she had been a friend of his second wife. He inherited his father's dukedom in 1839, thus his second wife was never Duchess of Argyll. The duke died, aged 69, in Inveraray Castle in Argyllshire and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church. Having been predeceased by his elder son John in 1837, he was succeeded in the dukedom and his other titles by his second son, George. ==References== Category:1770s births Category:1828 deaths Category:Scottish noblewomen ",
