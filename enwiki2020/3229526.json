In 1931, he switched to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and joined the Communist Youth League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands; KJVD), becoming leader of the KJVD subdistrict of Duisburg-Hamborn. In 1933, after the Nazis had seized power, he was working illegally for the KPD and ended up in \"protective custody\" many times. From October 1933 until 1936, he was at B\u00f6rgermoor and Esterwegen concentration camps, and until 1937 in pre-trial custody in Duisburg. He was sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to one year and nine months in prison, released from custody, and banished from the Ruhr area. In April, Lemmnitz emigrated to the Netherlands, where he became a member of the KPD leadership in Amsterdam. After the Wehrmacht marched into the Netherlands, he was once again arrested and then sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to ten years in labour prison (Zuchthaus). Until 1945, he was an inmate at the labour prison in Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden. In 1946, Lemmnitz joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), took his studies up once again, graduating from the University of Leipzig in 1948.
