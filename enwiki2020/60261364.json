Brought up in one of Masally's noble families, Sardar went to school at the age of seven and during the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics got secondary education at the Masally District school. He is the 5th child among 6 children of the late Mashhadi Akif. He was interested in religion and religious studies from childhood. Along with school classes, he participated in Quran teaching and religion classes during the period of the Soviet Union. In his youth he began to learn the religious issues from the local theologians. He started to propagandize religious teachings in Masally and its vicinity when he was 15\u201316 years old. Taking into account the people's request, Sardar in the months of Ramadan, Muharram and Safar read three or even four sermons per day and conducted religious rites. At the age of 15 he was able to hold religious meetings and was a great preacher in his town. He was such a great preacher that received lots of invitations from people in the cities and villages. To support religious ceremonies, the young cleric traveled to various places and sometimes far lands during the month of Ramadan and the mourning of Muharram (the anniversary of the Battle of Karbala, when Imam Hussein, the grandson of Muhammad, was killed by the forces of the second Umayyad caliph) for preaching and teaching religious issues to people. As there were few clerics and a lot of invitations to the religious ceremonies, Sheikh conducted the service sometimes 4 times a day. Despite being well known and popular among people he was always seeking to get knowledge. To gain more knowledge in Islamic teachings he went to one of the great scholars of that time, Hujjatul-islam Molla Beilar. Sardar could attract his favorite teacher's attention and after a while he turned into one of the trusted students of Molla Beilar.
