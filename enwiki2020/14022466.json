A native of Pittsburgh, he has a bachelor's degree from the University of Pittsburgh (A&S; 1959) and a M.D. from their School of Medicine (1963). He completed his residency at Duke University and spent four years at the National Institute of Health followed by four years serving as the Luscious Birch Professor and the director of the Reproductive Biology Center at Vanderbilt University. He then moved to Baylor as Professor and Chairman of Molecular and Cellular Biology. O\u2019Malley's work has been on the primary actions of steroid hormones and nuclear receptors. Bert elucidated the overall genetic transcriptional pathway of steroid and intracellular hormone action, discovered nuclear receptor(NR) coactivators (CoAs), discovered the functional 3-D structures CoA-NR complexes on DNA, and the critical roles for coactivators in physiology and diseases. He has published over 700 papers and holds 29 patents in the fields of gene regulation, molecular endocrinology and steroid receptors and transcriptional coactivators. His work on molecular mechanisms of steroid receptor coactivators has great relevance to genetic and reproductive diseases, disorders of metabolism and diabetes, myocardial infarct induced heart failure, and especially, cancers. He is considered as the 'father of molecular endocrinology' and has received over 65 national/international awards/prizes for his scientific achievements in this field. He was awarded the National Medal of Science by U.S. President George W. Bush on September 29, 2008. O'Malley is a brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and was initiated at the Gamma Sigma chapter at the University of Pittsburgh. ==Honors and awards== *Dickson Prize, 1979 *Fred Conrad Koch Medal in 1998 *President of the Endocrine Society in 1985 *Member National Academy of Sciences, 1992 *Rodbell Award (NIH) in 2001 *Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize for Biology in 2001 *Brinker Award in Breast Cancer Research in 2001 *Pasarow Award in Cancer Research in 2006 *Carl Hartman Award for Reproductive Research in 2007 *National Medal of Science, 2008 *Steven Beering Award in Medical Research in 2009 *Ernst Schering Prize, 2011 *Ipsen Foundation Research Prize in Endocrinology in 2013 *Outstanding Innovation Award (End.Soc.) in 2015 *Jensen Lifetime Achievement Award (U.Cinn.) in 2018 *Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, 2018 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize 2018 *Memberships: American Assoc.
