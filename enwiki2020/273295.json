In 1869 the school moved to a new, spired, wooden building on the hills above the central city in Clifton Terrace from where it could be seen from many places in Wellington.William Main, Wellington Through a Victorian lens revisited, Steele Roberts Publishers, Wellington, 2011, p. 25, the endpapers and the dustjacket. In 1874 the college opened in a much larger building at its present location. The former boarding establishment at the College, Firth House, was named after Joseph Firth, the headmaster from 1892 to 1921. Wellington College's Pavilion, Firth House and the Gifford Observatory were opened on 1 December, 1924. The War Memorial Hall was opened on 2 March, 1928, financially supported by \u00a36000 from the Old Boys' Association.Wellington College. | NZETC The War Memorial Hall and classroom wings were demolished by the Ministry of Works and replaced in the 1960s with a new hall and seven-storey Tower classroom block due to its lack of earthquake reinforcements. The stained glass window from the front of the War Memorial Hall is now located in the front of the existing hall. During the 1970s the Maths, Library and Technology blocks were opened, replacing the last of the War Memorial Hall building and classroom wings that opened in 1928. Also, the Old Boys Gymnasium was built on the eastern boundary of the campus replacing the swimming pool. In 1980 Firth House was demolished to make way for a new gymnasium which opened in 1982. 1988 saw the opening of the Arts and Music block, and the Brierley Theatre, named after old boy Ron Brierley. The first dedicated computer rooms in the College opened in 1994 in a new building located behind the school hall. 2001 saw the opening of the Science block, on the western boundary of the campus. In 2008 the Languages block opened, also located on the western boundary. The campus also has many prefabricated buildings, some functioning as offices and some as classrooms. The only \"historical\" buildings remaining on campus to this day are Firth Hall, the Pavilion and the Gifford Observatory. Firth Hall, left, and the former College Hall, right In 2016, the College Hall was demolished to make way for a larger Assembly Hall and Performing Arts Centre, which would be able to hold the entire school with its growing population. In preparation for this, the staffroom was moved to Firth Hall, the Uniform Shop opened a new premise next to the Archives, and the Computer Block was opened on the first floor of Tower Block. Construction on the new hall commenced in September 2016, starting with the removal of the Memorial Window. ==About== Wellington College's enrolment zone mainly covers the central and western suburbs of Wellington (Rongotai College serves the southeastern suburbs, and Onslow College the northern suburbs). Each year the school's rugby team plays in a competition with Nelson College, Christ's College, and Wanganui Collegiate School known as the \"Quadrangular Tournament\". Wellington are the reigning champions of this tournament and have been since 2003. Their current winning streak of ten titles in a row is the longest in the tournament's history.https://sites.google.com/a/wellington-college.school.nz/rugby- club/draws/quad-2011 The school also competes in a local athletics competition known as \"McEvedy Shield\" along with St. Patrick's College (Town), St. Patrick's College (Silverstream) and Rongotai College. Historically, Wellington College have won the shield more than any other school. It is next to Wellington East Girls' College, also in Mount Victoria, and shares with that college the Gifford Observatory. Although Wellington College is situated next to Wellington East Girls' College, its sister college is Wellington Girls' College located in Thorndon. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Wellington College earned the highest number of scholarships in the New Zealand scholarship exams.http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the- wellingtonian/8362283/Wgtn-Colleges-stunning-results ==Board of Trustees== The Wellington College Board of Trustees consists of twelve elected and appointed members.https://www.wellington-college.school.nz/about-us/board-of-trustees ==Notable alumni== === The Arts === * Maxwell Fernie \u2013 organist, conductor and music teacher * Alexander Grant \u2013 ballet dancer, teacher, and company director * Jonathan Harlen \u2013 author * Dai Henwood \u2013 comedian * Raybon Kan \u2013 writer and comedian * Bret McKenzie \u2013 Academy Award-winning songwriter and member of Flight of the Conchords * John Mulgan \u2013 editor, writer, journalist and Army officer * Robert J.
