    "text": "Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine Reserve is a protected area in the North Island of New Zealand. Goat Island lies within the reserve and Leigh is the closest town. Auckland University operates Leigh Marine Laboratory at the reserve. It was created in 1975 as the first marine reserve in New Zealand. With more than 200,000 visitors per year, it is a popular spot for snorkellers and scuba-divers, due to the abundance and diversity of fish now living within the reserve, after over 35 years of protection. Species that can be found in the reserve include Australasian snapper and New Zealand sea urchin (kina). ==See also== * Leigh Marine Laboratory *List of marine reserves of New Zealand ==References== ==External links== *Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine Reserve at the Department of Conservation Category:Marine reserves of New Zealand Category:Rodney District Category:Protected areas established in 1975 Category:Protected areas of the Auckland Region Category:1975 establishments in New Zealand ",
