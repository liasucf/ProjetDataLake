    "text": "Sants Estaci\u00f3 is a station in the Barcelona Metro network in the Sants- Montju\u00efc district of Barcelona. It serves the Barcelona Sants railway station, Barcelona's principal main line railway station, and is named Sants Estaci\u00f3 to distinguish it from the nearby Pla\u00e7a de Sants station also named after the Sants neighbourhood. It is served by line L3 and line L5. The line L3 section of the station is situated under Num\u00e0ncia street, between Melcior Palau and Avinguda Josep Tarradellas. It has a hall at each side of the station. To access to the railway station it is necessary to go through line 5 hall. The station is equipped with numerous elevators, and has two side platforms that are in length. The line L5 section of the station was opened in 1969 with the opening of the line between Collblanc and Diagonal. The metro station is situated on the north part of the railway station, between Guitard and Enric Barg\u00e9s streets. The station is complex but has an own hall on the west side which has two direct accesses to the railway station. It has two side platforms that are in length. On the other side of the station there is the corridor to connect with line 3. Sants Estaci\u00f3 is one of three stations where lines L3 and L5 connect, the others being Diagonal and Vall d'Hebron metro stations. Like both these two stations, the platforms of the two lines at Sants Estaci\u00f3 are connected by an underground passageway. However, unlike the other two, there is also a single track connection between the two lines at Sants Estaci\u00f3. The line L5 station was opened in 1969 with the opening of the line between Collblanc and Diagonal, whilst the line L3 station followed in 1975 with the opening of the line from this station to Zona Universit\u00e0ria. A second access hall to the L3 station was added in 2004. ==Gallery== File:Barcelona Metro - Sants Estacio.jpg|Large illuminated metro map at entrance to the metro station from the main line concourse File:Sants Estacio Line3.jpg|The line L3 platforms ==References== ==External links== Category:Barcelona Metro line 3 stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1969 Category:Railway stations opened in 1975 Category:Transport in Eixample Category:1969 establishments in Spain Category:1975 establishments in Spain ",
