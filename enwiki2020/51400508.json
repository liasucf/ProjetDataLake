It's also becoming increasingly relevant for the music it serves up, especially at this developing annual event.\" the paper said. In 2014, Experty.by\u2019s \u0179micier Biezkaravajny via Belorusy i rynok said, \u201cThe Tallinn one is attractive primarily because it is one of the highest-rated but at the same time affordable events in terms of opportunities for a little-known artist to demonstrate its work to a foreign listener.\u201d In 2016, Tom Hawking on Flavorwire pointed out that \"/.../ the Estonian national government clearly has no problem providing state funding for such an endeavor, as well as getting involved in other, more hands-on ways. And by that, I mean that the freaking President of Estonia played a DJ set at this year's festival. As much as \"cool\" is an integral part of Barack Obama's brand, it's hard to imagine him getting on the wheels of steel to drop an impromptu Chicago house set.\" In 2017\u20132018 The Quietus has published articles on Estonian experimental music and acknowledged TMW for \u201cpromoting leftfield adventurous artists and feeding off questions of gender identity and social righteousness\u201d. In 2019 Forbes introduced the TMW festival centre Telliskivi Creative City as the new burgeoning arts hub. == References == == External links == * Official webpage Category:Music festivals in Estonia Category:Culture in Tallinn Category:Spring (season) events in Estonia ",
