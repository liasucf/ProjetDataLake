    "text": "Elektro the Moto-Man and his Little Dog Sparko Elektro is the nickname of a robot built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in its Mansfield, Ohio facility between 1937 and 1938. Seven feet tall (2.1 m), weighing 265 pounds (120.2 kg), humanoid in appearance, he could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move his head and arms. Elektro's body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. His photoelectric \"eyes\" could distinguish red and green light. He was on exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair and reappeared at that fair in 1940, with \"Sparko\", a robot dog that could bark, sit, and beg to humans. ==History== Elektro toured North America in 1950 in promotional appearances for Westinghouse, and was displayed at Pacific Ocean Park in Venice, California in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also appeared as \"Thinko\", in Sex Kittens Go to College (1960). In the 1960s, his head was given to Harold Gorsuch, a retiring Westinghouse engineer. In 1992, the dance band Meat Beat Manifesto produced the song \"Original Control (Version 2)\" which prominently featured snippets of Elektro's monologues, quoting lines such as \"I am Elektro\" and \"My brain is bigger than yours\". An Elektro robot was seen in the November 24, 2019 episode of Mr. Robot, located in a storage room of the Queens Museum that was near the site of the Original 1939 and 1964 world's fair. Elektro survived the scrap pile and is currently the property of the Mansfield Memorial Museum. In 2013, a replica of Elektro was exhibited at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI. == References == ==External links== *Elektro commentary *YouTube Video footage of Elektro at the 1939 World's Fair *The Middleton Family at the New York World's Fair (1939) Shows entire Elektro demo starting at 34 minutes into movie. *Mansfield Memorial Museum Category:Historical robots Category:Mansfield, Ohio Category:1939 New York World's Fair Category:Humanoid robots Category:1937 robots Category:Robots of the United States ",
