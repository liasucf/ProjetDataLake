The hobby is a combination of environmentalism and treasure hunting. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large debris such as discarded bicycles, guns, safes, bombs, coins and car tire rims from bodies of water, but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. Magnet fishers have also been known to return stolen safes to their owners after a number of years. It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water. Alt URL The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as English rugby player James Haskell. ==Potential harms== Some environmentalists worry that removing objects can stir up sediment that contains toxic materials, or disturb archaeological sites. Some magnet fishers have retrieved dangerous objects, including loaded guns and unexploded ordinance.Casting about for a new pastime during the pandemic? With magnet fishing, \"it's all about the find\" ==Magnet fishing and the law== Depending on the jurisdiction, anything of value may belong to the local government, not the finder. === England & Wales === Magnet fishing is subject to local regulations concerning outdoor waters. It is legal but the Canal & River Trust, which owns most of the UK's canals, has bylaws prohibiting people from removing material from the canal and rivers it owns so fishers may be subject to a \u00a325 fine, to magnet-fish, or remove any material from canal or inland navigation under the control of the Canal & River Trust in England or Wales, other than the Lee and Stort Navigation, Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, and River Severn Navigation. The Trust \"expressly prohibit[s]\" the practice although it refrains from legal action against first-time offenders. In 2018, a child magnet-fished a sawn-off shotgun out of the Titford Canal in Oldbury, West Midlands. === Hamburg === In Hamburg, magnet fishing without a permit is punishable by fine. === Belgium === Amateur magnetfishers in Belgium helped the police by recovering new evidence, specifically firearms and ammunition, related to the crimes of the Brabant killers. In general, police urge those who find weapons or similar items to contact them. ==See also== * * * * * * ==References== Category:Magnetism Category:Hobbies Category:Water pollution Category:Public archaeology Category:Treasure Category:Metal detecting Category:Litter Category:Waste collection ",
