First, his work focuses on the development of innovative methods to improve access to effective mental health treatments and services. He conducts research on new technologies (such as video conferencing and mobile platforms) to meaningfully expand the reach of mental health care.Comer, J.S., Furr, J.M., Kerns, C.E., Miguel, E., Coxe, S., Elkins, R.M., Carpenter, A.L., Cornacchio, D., Cooper- Vince, C.E., DeSerisy, M., Chou, T., Sanchez, A.L., Khanna, M., Franklin, M.E., Garcia, A.M., & Freeman, J.B.
