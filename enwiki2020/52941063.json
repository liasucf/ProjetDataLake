    "text": "Beach Rats is a 2017 American drama film directed by Eliza Hittman. It stars Harris Dickinson, Madeline Weinstein, and Kate Hodge. It was screened at the U.S. Dramatic Competition section of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, and was theatrically released on August 25, 2017, by Neon. ==Plot== Frankie (Harris Dickinson) struggles to escape his Brooklyn home life. He balances his time with a new girlfriend (Madeline Weinstein), his friends, and chatting on the internet with older men with whom he meets up for sex and drugs. He does not, however, identify as bisexual or gay to his girlfriend or male friends. He just \"has sex with men\", in the words of one of his internet partners. Frankie attempts to compartmentalize his life by having sex with older men, hoping to avoid anyone who might happen to know his friends. This becomes increasingly difficult, however, as he moves about the area and happens to run into them or lures them to meetings for drugs. ==Cast== ==Production== In April 2016, it was announced Eliza Hittman would direct the film, based upon a screenplay she had written. Cinereach and Animal Kingdom produced the film, alongside Secret Engine. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival on January 23. Shortly after, Neon acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released theatrically on August 25, 2017. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Hittman receiving The Directing Award: U.S. Dramatic at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival Beach Rats received positive reviews from film critics.
