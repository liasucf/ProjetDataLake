    "text": "Capillaria is a genus of nematodes in the family Capillariidae (or, according to classifications, in the family Trichinellidae). Since the taxonomy of the Capillariidae is disputed, species are included within the single genus Capillaria or 22 different genera (Amphibiocapillaria, Aonchotheca, Baruscapillaria, Calodium, Capillaria, Capillostrongyloides, Crocodylocapillaria, Echinocoleus, Eucoleus, Freitascapillaria, Gessyella, Liniscus, Paracapillaria, Paracapillaroides, Pearsonema, Paratrichosoma, Pseudocapillaria, Piscicapillaria, Pseudocapillaroides, Pterothominx, Schulmanela, and Tenoranema).Moravec, Franti\u0161ek 2001: Trichinelloid Nematodes parasitic in cold-blooded vertebrates. Academia, Praha, 432 pp. (list of genera in pages 30-32) () Some species parasitic in fish, previously classified within Capillaria, are now included in Huffmanela (family Trichosomoididae). Old literature, and sometimes modern medical literature, use Capillaria as a genus for species included in all these genera. The term Capillariasis is generally used for diseases produced by species of Capillaria, even if the species is now placed in another genus. ==Species== Capillaria plectropomi, caudal end of male Species in the genus Capillaria include (among hundreds of described species): * Capillaria aerophila; modern name Eucoleus aerophilus; a parasite of the respiratory system of foxes and other mammals * Capillaria gastrica; a parasite of rodents * Capillaria hepatica; modern name Calodium hepaticum; cause of hepatic capillariasis in man * Capillaria philippinensis; modern name Paracapillaria philippinensis; cause of intestinal capillariasis in man * Capillaria plica; modern name Pearsonema plica; a parasite of the urinary system of dogs and other mammals * Capillaria feliscati; modern name Pearsonema feliscati; a parasite of the urinary system of cats and other mammals == References == == See also == *Capillariasis, a disease caused by some Capillaria species Category:Enoplea genera Category:Parasitic nematodes of mammals ",
