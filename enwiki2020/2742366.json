    "text": "Magnolia globosa, the globe magnolia or hen magnolia, is a species of Magnolia native to Bhutan, southwestern China (Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan), northeastern India (Assam, Sikkim), northern Myanmar-Burma, and eastern Nepal. ==Description== It is a deciduous large shrub or small tree growing to 7\u201310 m tall. The leaves are variable in shape, obovate, elliptic-ovate or broadly ovate, 10\u201324 cm long and 5\u201314 cm broad, glossy dark green above, paler and slightly downy below, and with a bluntly acute apex. The flowers are creamy white, 6-7.6 cm wide, with the 9-12 tepals all about the same size; they are fragrant, nodding or pendent, and have a rounded, globose profile. ==Cultivation== It is closely related to M. wilsonii and M. sieboldii, and is rare though in cultivation. Flowers are less showy than other species in the genus, so use as a foliage plant would fit this species best. ==References== ==External links== *Hunt, D. (ed). (1998). Magnolias and their allies.
