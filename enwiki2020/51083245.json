US actor Lee Marvin became a one-hit wonder in the UK this year with the song \"Wand'rin' Star\", taken from the movie Paint Your Wagon. It spent three weeks at number-one, lasted nine weeks in the top 10 and became the eighth best selling single of 1970. Welsh musician Dave Edmunds achieved the Christmas number-one single of 1970 with his version of \"I Hear You Knocking\". The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1970, as well as singles which peaked in 1969 and 1971 but were in the top 10 in 1970. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). One-hundred and twenty-two singles were in the top ten in 1970. Eleven singles from 1969 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"Grandad\" by Clive Dunn, \"I'll Be There\" by The Jackson 5 and \"Ride a White Swan\" by T. Rex were all released in 1970 but did not reach their peak until 1971. \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\" by Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell, \"Melting Pot\" by Blue Mink, \"Suspicious Minds\" by Elvis Presley and \"Tracy\" by The Cuff Links were the singles from 1969 to reach their peak in 1970. Nineteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1970. Chicago, Deep Purple, Hot Chocolate, The Jackson 5 and Neil Diamond were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1970. The 1969 Christmas number-one, \"Two Little Boys\" by Rolf Harris, remained at number-one for the first four weeks of 1970. The first new number- one single of the year was \"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\" by Edison Lighthouse. Overall, fourteen different singles peaked at number-one in 1970, with fourteen unique artists having singles hit that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== One-hundred and twenty-two singles charted in the top 10 in 1970, with one-hundred and twelve singles reaching their peak this year. Nineteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1970. Elvis Presley and The Jackson 5 shared the record for most top 10 hits in 1970 with four hit singles each. Christie was one of a number of artists with two top-ten entries, including the number-one single \"Yellow River\". Andy Williams, The Dave Clark Five, Gerry Monroe, Marmalade and Stevie Wonder were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1970. ===Chart debuts=== Fifty-one artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1970, either as a lead or featured artist. Of these, five went on to record another hit single that year: Chairmen of the Board, Chicago, Christie, Gerry Monroe and White Plains. The Jackson 5 had three other entries in their breakthrough year.
