    "text": "Nathan Carroll (born 20 October 1980) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Melbourne in the Australian Football League (AFL). Carroll was recruited to the Fremantle Football Club from Claremont in the 2000 Rookie Draft and stayed on the rookie list for one season (2000) before being delisted. A defender, he was selected by Melbourne in the 2003 Rookie Draft and he made his AFL debut that season. After playing only eleven games in his first two seasons, 2005 loomed as an important year for Carroll. He made his way into the team late in the season, before an injury in the Round 18 loss to St Kilda sidelined him for two weeks. He was recalled for the last three games of Melbourne's season. He underwent surgery on his shoulder at the end of the 2005 season. In 2006, Carroll was a much improved player and played all 24 games in easily his best season to date.O'Connor, Alison.
