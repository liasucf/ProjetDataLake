    "text": "is Hitomi Takahashi's third single under the Sony Records label. The single was released on November 30, 2005, in two different formats: CD only and CD+DVD. This is the third retail single to be released for her first album Sympathy. ==Overview== \"Aozora no Namida\" was used as the first opening theme song for the anime Blood+. The single was originally slated to be released on October 12, 2005, but was pushed back to a later date. This is Hitomi's first single to be in two formats, CD only and CD+DVD. On its first day on the Oricon charts, \"Aozora no Namida\" hit #5, and managed to get #8 for its first week. The music video for this single includes animation of Blood+ made specifically for the video. A rerecorded version of \"Aozora no Namida\" was recorded in 2007 on her single, \"Tsuyoku Nare\", and features a stronger punk/rock influence as opposed to the pop/rock influence of the original. ==Music video== A screen capture of the music video. The promotional video for \"Aozora no Namida\" was directed by AT, and, like her previous two, was filmed at an unknown location. The PV starts off with the main character of Blood+, Saya Otonashi, preparing to fight a Chiropteran. The scene suddenly changes to Hitomi waking up on a staircase, looking around, and then walking down the staircase. The scene changes again to Saya killing the Chiropteran, the scene also constantly switching from Hitomi to this scene as Hitomi continues to \"search\" around the place. As the PV progresses, Hitomi stumbles upon Saya fighting another Chiropteran, with Saya losing control of her sword. Also, other scenes of Hitomi can be seen; Hitomi sitting on a bunch of rocks with steam around her, and Hitomi singing in a subway-like setting (this is also where the fight against the second Chiropteran takes place). Hitomi grabs the sword and kills the Chiropteran causing Saya to disappear with a smile. The end of the PV features Hitomi walking out onto a cliff to view a city being ravaged by more Chiroptera, her eyes glowing red. ==Track listing== ;CD # - 4:31 Lyrics by Hitomi Takahashi & Natsumi Watanabe Music by Hidenori Tanaka Arrangement by Hyoe Yasuhara # - 3:28 Lyrics by Hitomi Takahashi & mavie Music and arrangement by Shinya Saito # \"My Answer\" - 5:23 Lyrics by mavie Music and arrangement by Yuta Nakano # \"Aozora no Namida -Instrumental-\" (Hidenori Tanaka) - 4:31 ;DVD # \"Aozora no Namida\" (PV) - 4:36 ==Personnel== *Hitomi Takahashi - vocals ==Production== *Producer - Kazuma Jo *Directors - Kazuma Jo, Taku Sugawara *Recording - Eiichi Nishizawa (Studio Rine) *Mixing - Eiichi Nishizawa (Studio Rine) *Music Video Director - AT (Hinx Minx) ==Performances== *2005 - MBS Anime Fes.'05 *October 29, 2005 - Music Fair 21 *December 10, 2005 - CDTV *December 18, 2005 - \"Sendai 89ers vs. Osaka Evessa\" basketball game *May 7, 2006 - Sony Music Anime Fes.06 *June 11, 2006 - Sony Music Anime Fes.06 at Osaka ==Charts== Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"650px\" !align=\"left\"|Release !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Peak Position !align=\"left\"|First Week Sales !align=\"left\"|Sales Total !align=\"left\"|Chart Run |- |align=\"left\"|November 30, 2005 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Daily Singles Chart |align=\"left\"|#5 | | | |- |align=\"left\"|November 30, 2005 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Weekly Singles Chart |align=\"left\"|#8 |align=\"left\"|44,629 |align=\"left\"|83,523 |align=\"left\"|12+ weeks |- |align=\"left\"|November 30, 2005 |align=\"left\"|Oricon Yearly Singles Chart |align=\"left\"| | | | |- |} ==RIAJ certification== \"Aozora no Namida\" has been certified gold for shipments of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. == References == Category:2005 singles Category:Anime songs Category:Hitomi Takahashi (singer) songs Category:Songs written by Hitomi Takahashi (singer) Category:Gr8!
