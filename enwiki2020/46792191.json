    "text": "Mercedes Vald\u00e9s Granit (September 24, 1922 \u2013 June 13, 1996), better known as Merceditas Vald\u00e9s, was a Cuban singer who specialized in Afro-Cuban traditional music. Under the aegis of ethnomusicologists Fernando Ortiz and Obdulio Morales, Vald\u00e9s helped popularize Afro-Cuban music throughout Latin America. In 1949, she became one of the first female Santer\u00eda singers to be recorded. Her debut album was released at the start of the 1960s, when the Cuban government nationalized the record industry. She then went on hiatus before making a comeback in the 1980s with a series of albums entitled Ach\u00e9, in collaboration with artists such as Frank Emilio Flynn and rumba ensemble Yoruba Andabo. She also appeared in Jane Bunnett's Spirits of Havana and continued performing until her death in 1996. == Life and career == === Early life === Vald\u00e9s was born in Cayo Hueso, Centro Habana, on September 24 (D\u00eda de las Mercedes), 1922.Ariel, Sigfredo (2006). Liner notes to Las voces del siglo. Havana, Cuba: EGREM. CD 0808. Her father was \u00c1ngel Vald\u00e9s, known as Angelito \"El Dichoso\" (The Lucky One), a musician in Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro's influential rumba ensemble Los Roncos. Unlike her mother, his father did not want her daughter to become a musician, so she started her career as a nun in the black congregation Hermanas Oblatas de la Providencia. However, she soon began to stand out as a singer, winning several prizes awarded by the radio show Corte Suprema del Arte, where she sang songs such as \"Babal\u00fa\" by Margarita Lecuona. She then joined the orchestra of pianist and musicologist Obdulio Morales thanks to his sisters, who lived with Vald\u00e9s at the congregation. With Morales, Vald\u00e9s gained exposure due to their performances which were broadcast by Radio Cadena Suaritos on Sundays. In 1944, she met musicologist Fernando Ortiz, one of the main exponents of the Afrocubanismo movement, who employed Vald\u00e9s in his lectures about Afro-Cuban culture to exemplify the African heritage (especially Yoruba) of Cuban music. Thus, Vald\u00e9s became an akpw\u00f3n, a Santer\u00eda singer, which earned her the nickname La Peque\u00f1a Ach\u00e9 de Cuba, given to her by Ortiz. === First recordings and rise to fame === Vald\u00e9s made her first recordings of Santer\u00eda music in April 1949 for Victor. She sang in the same sessions as Evelia Collazo, another female akpw\u00f3n and the mother of percussionist Julito Collazo. The recordings were credited to Grupo Afro-Cubano. In 1951, Vald\u00e9s sang in the Rapsodia negra show directed by Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez M\u00e1ntici at the CMQ radio station. During the early 1950s, Vald\u00e9s recorded more Santer\u00eda tunes with the so-called Coro Yoruba y Tambores Bat\u00e1, an ensemble directed by bat\u00e1 drummer Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez and featuring other drummers such as Virgilio Ram\u00edrez, Trinidad Torregrosa and Carlos Aldama, as well as other singers: Celia Cruz, Caridad Su\u00e1rez and Eugenio de la Rosa. They recorded several songs for Panart, appearing in the 1954 LP Santero. She also recorded two EPs for SMC (New York City's Spanish Music Center): Cantos oriundos lucum\u00ed (Vols. 1 & 2). Apart from recording, Vald\u00e9s took part in several tours, some with Ernesto Lecuona's company, performing in Venezuela among other Latin American countries. In 1954, she sang \"Ogguere\" and \"Bemb\u00e9\" with Gilberto Vald\u00e9s' orchestra at Carnegie Hall. In Cuba, she became the star of the Zun Zun Danba\u00e9 show at the Cabaret Sans Souci. She then worked at the Tropicana Club. In 1957, Vald\u00e9s appeared in the Afro-Cuban themed film Yamba\u00f3. In the late 1950s she married famed timbalero Guillermo Barreto. After the Cuban Revolution, the commercialization of Afro-Cuban music was restricted. Nonetheless, Vald\u00e9s managed to make several recordings in the early 1960s before effectively halting her recording career. In 1959, she recorded her debut album, which comprised one side of secular Afro-Cuban music, recorded in collaboration with Los Bucaneros under the direction of Rafael Somavilla and Adolfo Guzm\u00e1n, and one side of religious Santer\u00eda music featuring Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez and his group, Isupo Irawo (a new incarnation of the Coro Yoruba y Tambores Bat\u00e1). The recordings were made at the former Panart studios and later released by Panart Nacionalizada when the label was taken over by the Cuban government. Between 1959 and 1960, she recorded with percussionist Mongo Santamar\u00eda. In 1960 and 1961, she recorded carnival music with Alberto Zayas for Impresora Cubana de Discos (ICD). She then recorded two singles with Los Papines for the newly established EGREM. === Late career and death === Vald\u00e9s resumed her recording career in 1982 with the recording of Ach\u00e9 for Siboney, an imprint of EGREM. The album featured again Isupo Irawo and Los Amigos (an ensemble directed by pianist Frank Emilio Flynn and featuring Guillermo Barreto). Several LPs followed: Ach\u00e9 II (1988), Ach\u00e9 III (1989), Ach\u00e9 IV (1990) and Ach\u00e9 V (1993), the latter two in collaboration with Yoruba Andabo. In 1988, she toured Spain and Canada with Sergio Vitier's Grupo Oru. In 1989, she sang in Cuban\u00edsimo, an album of classic Cuban recordings presented as medleys under the direction of Andr\u00e9s Al\u00e9n and Ram\u00f3n Huerta, and featuring Guillermo Barreto and Jacqueline Castellanos among others. The album was released in 1990 by EGREM (Cuba) and Fonomusic (Spain). In 1991, she sang in Jane Bunnett's Spirits of Havana, one of the last recordings featuring Guillermo Barreto. She also appeared in Bunnett's Chamalongo, released in 1997. Merceditas Vald\u00e9s died on June 13, 1996, aged 73, in her hometown of Havana, almost five years after the death of her husband. Her last album, Ache V, which had only been available in cassette format, was re-released in 1998 by Ralph Mercado under the title Merceditas Vald\u00e9s with her Big Band - The Final Recordings. == Awards and honors == *1996: UNESCO Picasso Medal and Diploma of Merit == Discography == LPs *1954: Santero (Panart) \u2013 with others under the direction of Facundo Rivero *1960: Merceditas Vald\u00e9s (Panart Nacionalizada) \u2013 with Los Bucaneros *1961: Carnaval 1960-61 (ICD) \u2013 with others under the direction of Carlos Ansa *1982: Ach\u00e9 (EGREM) *1988: Ach\u00e9 II (EGREM) *1989: Orishas: Ach\u00e9 III (EGREM) *1990: Cuban\u00edsimo (EGREM/Fonomusic) \u2013 with others under the direction of Andr\u00e9s Al\u00e9n and Ram\u00f3n Huerta *1990: Ach\u00e9 IV (EGREM) \u2013 with Yoruba Andabo *1993: Ach\u00e9 V (EGREM) \u2013 with Yoruba Andabo Singles & EPs *195x: Canto oriundo lucum\u00ed (1 & 2) (SMC) *1957: \"Er d\u00eda que nac\u00ed yo\" / \"Ya me cans\u00e9\" (Puchito) *1960: \"Una pena\" / \"Vida, mi delirio es quererte\" (Panart Nacionalizada) *1961: \"A coger la guampara\" (INC) *1961: \"Och\u00fan\" / \"Yemay\u00e1\" (INC) *1964: Rezos yorubas (EGREM) *1964: \"Invocaci\u00f3n a Elegua y a Chang\u00f3\" / \"Tasca-Tasca\" (EGREM) *1964: \"Muri\u00e9ndome de risa\" / \"Devu\u00e9lveme el coco\" (EGREM) == Notes == == References == Category:1922 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Cuban female singers Category:20th-century Cuban singers Category:People from Havana Category:Cuban Santer\u00edans Category:Yoruba- language singers Category:20th-century women singers ",
