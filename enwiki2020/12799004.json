    "text": "The sixth season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between November 15, 1980, and April 11, 1981. This season was alternatively known as Saturday Night Live '80. ==Background== According to Tom Shales' book Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, Executive Producer Lorne Michaels cited burnout as the reason behind his desire to take a year off, and had been led to believe by NBC executives that the show would go on hiatus with him, and be ready to start fresh upon his return. However, Lorne Michaels learned from associate producer Jean Doumanian that the show would go on with or without him, and that she had been chosen as his replacement, much to Michaels's surprise and dismay. Angered by this news, the entire cast and all but one writer (Brian Doyle-Murray) followed Lorne Michaels out the door. The sixth season began with a completely new cast and new writers, with Jean Doumanian at the helm. Jean Doumanian hired Denny Dillon, Gilbert Gottfried, Gail Matthius, Eddie Murphy, Joe Piscopo, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket as repertory players, and Yvonne Hudson, Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers as featured players. In doing so, she passed on such then-unknown performers as Jim Carrey, John Goodman and Paul Reubens. Jean Doumanian sought a non-white cast member to fill Garrett Morris' previous role. As SNL scholars Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad phrase it, > Jean still needed an ethnic, and a special series of auditions was set up to > find one. For two days in mid-September some thirty black actors and > comedians filed through the writers' wing on the 17th floor [of Rockefeller > Center] to read for Jean and her people. At the end, Jean told her group she > was leaning toward hiring a stand-up by the name of Charlie Barnett. But > talent coordinator Neil Levy had another black performer he wanted her to > see, a kid from Roosevelt, Long Island, named Eddie Murphy.Hill and > Weingrad, p. 391. Some accounts state that Jean Doumanian preferred instead Robert Townsend, but Eddie Murphy was added (as a featured player) starting with the fourth episode, after much convincing from her colleagues and staff. With its team of entirely new writers and cast members, the show was plagued by problems from the start and deemed a commercial disappointment by critics, and by viewers as reflected in the Nielsen ratings. For much of the season, the show was in turmoil and many critics wrote the show off as a pale imitation of its former glory due to budget cuts, lack of support that was promised to Jean Doumanian by either the network or her staff, and stiff competition from ABC's Fridays, which, at the time, enjoyed critical acclaim and was gaining popularity as a similarly-\"edgy\", late-night sketch show that aired on a weekend. On February 21, 1981, the show featured a parody of the \"Who Shot J.R. Ewing?\" episode from the hit TV show Dallas. In a cliffhanger titled \"Who Shot C.R.?\", cast member Charles Rocket was \"shot\" in the last sketch of the episode, after a running gag in which other members of the cast shared their grievances about Charles Rocket with one another. Onstage for the goodnights, Dallas star and that week's host, Charlene Tilton, asked Charles Rocket (who was still in character and sitting in a wheelchair) his thoughts on being shot. \"Oh man, it's the first time I've been shot in my life\", he replied. \"I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\" The cast, along with some of the audience, reacted with laughter and applause. Though this was not the first nor last time the expletive would be uttered live on SNL, Charles Rocket's line, unknown to him, would be the final straw that caused him and everyone else (save Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo) to be dismissed. The next show would be Jean Doumanian's last episode. \"This woman was a trainwreck,\" said then NBC President and CEO Fred Silverman in the Shales book. \"The shows were just not watchable.\" The show's new logo, used only for this season, featured the words \"Saturday Night Live\" in a pink graffiti text; it was accompanied in the 1980-aired episodes with \"'80\". ==The Ebersol era begins== SNL was given one more chance when Dick Ebersol, one of the original developers of SNL in 1974 and the man responsible for hiring Lorne Michaels as show-runner in 1975, was hired to replace Jean Doumanian. In his first week, Dick Ebersol fired Gilbert Gottfried, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket, replacing them with Tim Kazurinsky, Catherine O'Hara and Tony Rosato. Dick Ebersol made offers to John Candy and Catherine O'Hara (of SCTV) to join the cast. John Candy turned down the offer, so Tony Rosato was added to the cast in his place. Catherine O'Hara initially accepted, but changed her mind after Michael O'Donoghue - the show's original head writer, who had been brought in to rejuvenate the show - screamed at the cast about the season's poor writing and performances. Catherine O'Hara suggested Robin Duke as her replacement, and Robin Duke was brought in. Catherine O'Hara never appeared on SNL as a cast member. Laurie Metcalf and Emily Prager joined as featured players. Dick Ebersol's first produced episode was on April 11, 1981. After Dick Ebersol's first episode, the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike started, forcing the show into a hiatus during which it was extensively retooled. Before the next season, Dick Ebersol also fired Denny Dillon and Gail Matthius, leaving Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo the only remaining cast members from Jean Doumanian's tenure. ==Cast== ===(Episodes 1\u201312)=== Repertory players *Denny Dillon *Gilbert Gottfried *Gail Matthius *Eddie Murphy (first episode: December 13, 1980/upgraded to repertory status on January 24, 1981) *Joe Piscopo *Ann Risley *Charles Rocket Featured players *Yvonne Hudson (first episode: December 20, 1980) *Matthew Laurance (first episode: December 13, 1980) *Patrick Weathers (first episode: December 13, 1980/last episode: February 14, 1981) bold denotes Weekend Update anchor ===(Episode 13)=== Repertory players *Denny Dillon *Robin Duke *Tim Kazurinsky *Gail Matthius *Eddie Murphy *Joe Piscopo *Tony Rosato Featured players *Yvonne Hudson (uncredited) *Laurie Metcalf *Emily Prager (credited, but did not appear) ==Writers== Brian Doyle-Murray returned as the only writer from the previous season.

The Associated Press, mocking the Carters-in-the-Oval-Office sketch, wrote, \"The new Saturday Night Live is essentially crude, sophomoric and most of all self-consciously 'cool.' It is occasionally funny... Under producer Jean Doumanian, Saturday Night Live will define 'risk-taking' as a little naughtier, perhaps a little raunchier; it won't wander too far off the beaten path... They're all clones. This is television. If they can be funny once in a while, that's all we can ask.\" The New York Times said the season \"looked almost exactly as it did in previous years, but actually only the shell remained\". The review went on to state that the \"missing ingredient was the very quality that made the old show so special: an innovative vision\", and that the new show was \"nothing so much as an unfunny parody of its predecessor\". Hill and Weingrad summarized other reviews: > The Washington Star said the show \"strained and groaned\" while the humor was > \"almost completely lost, despite desperate attempts to wring it out of > raunch.\" Newsday's Marvin Kitman, as expected, ravaged the show gleefully, > calling it \"offensive and raunchy,\" and worse, not funny. \"This new edition > is terrible,\" he wrote. \"Call it 'Saturday Night Dead on Arrival'.\"Hill and > Weingrad, p. 412. Tom Shales had always been Saturday Night's strongest and most prestigious booster, and thus his reaction to the new show was more important than most. The headline on his review read FROM YUK TO YECCCH. The first sentence was: \"Vile from New York--It's Saturday Night.\" The show, Shales said, was a \"snide and sordid embarrassment\". It imitated the \"ribaldry and willingness to prod sacred cows\" of the Lorne Michaels years without having the least \"compensating satirical edge\". It was, he wrote, \"just haplessly pointless tastelessness\". Shales concluded that despite one or two imaginative moments from the show's filmmakers, \"from the six new performers and 13 new writers hired for the show, viewers got virtually no good news.\"... Jean made it clear that she thought the writing was primarily at fault. \"It's just got to be funnier,\" she said. Then she put a tape of the show on her videocassette machine to begin a sketch-by-sketch critique. According to writer Billy Brown, as she did she said, \"Watch this. And I hope you hate it, because you wrote it.\"Hill and Weingrad, pp. 412-413. In his book What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History, author David Hofstede included this season as one of 25 runners-up to the list. ==References== 06 Category:1980 American television seasons Category:1981 American television seasons Category:Saturday Night Live in the 1980s ",
