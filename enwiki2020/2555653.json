    "text": "The Plaza Bolivar, the location where the anthem was premiered The Anthem of the Carabobo State, Venezuela is one of a number of anthems for Venezuelan states composed in the early 20th century. It has lyrics composed in rhyme by Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez Gui\u00f1\u00e1n; the music was added by Sebasti\u00e1n D\u00edaz Pe\u00f1a. The anthem was first played on July 5, 1908 (being the anniversary of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence) at the Bol\u00ecvar Square of Valencia. ==History== ===History of the state of Carabobo=== The territories that are now part of Carabobo State were part of the former Venezuela Province during Spanish dominion. Since 1819 the Venezuela Province became a Department of the newly and only partially independent Colombian Republic and in 1824 the Department was divided into two provinces, one of them called Carabobo for the first time in honor of the battle that almost definitively defeated Spanish troops in Venezuela. In 1831 Venezuela separated from Colombia and in 1881 the provinces became Federal States. ===History of the anthem=== On April 4, 1908, a contest for writing and composing the lyrics and music for the Carabobo State Anthem was called by a decree of the President of the State Samuel Ni\u00f1o. For the lyrics jury were designate Francisco de Sales P\u00e9rez, Pedro Castillo, Luis P\u00e9rez Carre\u00f1o, F\u00e9lix Delf\u00edn Ortega y Joaqu\u00edn Rever\u00f3n. For the music jury were designated Mart\u00edn Requena, Jacinto Piana, Aquiles Antich, Luis Socorro y Miguel Denti. The winners of the contest were Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez Guin\u00e1n and Sebasti\u00e1n D\u00edaz Pe\u00f1a. Gonz\u00e1lez Guin\u00e1n (1854-1925) was born in Valencia and was a politician, writer and poet. In his political career, he was Minister of Public Instruction in 1888, congressman for his natal state in 1896 and President of the State in 1911. D\u00edaz Pe\u00f1a (1844-1926) was born in Puerto Cabello and was an important Venezuelan composer, pianist and music teacher. His best known piece of music is the joropo Maricela, composed in 1877, and arguably the inspiration for another joropo, Alma Llanera from Pedro El\u00edas Guti\u00e9rrez's eponymous zarzuela, one of the most recognizable Venezuelan compositions. El\u00edas Guti\u00e9rrez also composed the music for the Barinas State Anthem. ==Lyrics== In the lyrics Gonz\u00e1lez Gui\u00f1\u00e1n intends to glorify the State as the place where the decisive battle against Spanish rule was fought. However, Spanish troops were not spelt out for the country until 2 years after the Battle of Carabobo, when a capitulation made possible a peaceful withdrawal of the remaining Spanish troops and Spanish loyalists. Also the campaign that end in the Battle of Carabobo was intended to annex the territory of the Venezuela Province, a lot shorter than the modern day Venezuela, to the Gran Colombia republic rather than created a new independent Venezuelan state. But since the movement that finally separated several provinces from Gran Colombia to form the Venezuelan republic actually took place in Valencia, the State capital, the State remains its fame as the birthplace of the country. In fact, Proyecto Venezuela (Venezuela Project) the most important regional party (today a national party) uses the slogan: \"Carabobo were Venezuela was born\" in various propaganda. The lyrics begin with \"By the Sun that comes to enlighten\", because the sun became a symbol of the state: the arc of triumph of Carabobo with a rising sun as background can be seen in the state banner, in the top of the state coat of arms (without the arc) and in the logo of Proyecto Venezuela. Finally, the author makes reference in the last two verses to the end of the numerous civil wars that occurs in most of the county's 19th century history and which definitive ends with the upcoming of the governments of Cipriano Castro (1900-1908) and Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez (1908-1935). {| cellpadding=2 style=\"background:transparent;\" |- |align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Carabobo State Anthem * * * |- !
