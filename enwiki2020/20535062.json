    "text": "Coming Attractions is a sort-of compilation album by the artist Adrian Belew, originally released on February 8, 2000. It is a compilation of previews of works in progress, which include a new solo album, an acoustic record, a series of experimental guitar compositions, and a box set of rarities called DUST that will serve as an overview of his last 20 years of artistic activity. == Reviews == Alternative Press (05/00, p. 76) - 3 out of 5 \"...an engaging testament to the wide range of his formidable talents....Eclectic but cohesive [the album] is a perfect introduction to Belew's complex musical persona.\" CMJ (1/31/00, p. 30) \"...humorously 'normal'. Ranging from a more traditional and song-focused Beatles tribute like '117 Valley Drive' to the experimental 'No Such Guitar,' COMING ATTRACTIONS shows the breadth of Belew's talent.\" ==Track listing== All tracks written by Adrian Belew except where noted. #\"Inner Man\" \u2013 3:33 #\"Predator Feast\" \u2013 4:16 #\"117 Valley Drive\" \u2013 3:43 #\"Inner Revolution\" \u2013 3:21 #\"Time Waits\" \u2013 2:38 #\"I Know What I Know and That Is All I Know and I Know It\" \u2013 2:27 #\"People\" (Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford, Robert Fripp, Trey Gunn, Tony Levin) \u2013 3:47 #\"No Such Guitar\" \u2013 3:56 #\"Bird in a Box\" \u2013 3:33 #\"House of Cards\" \u2013 4:06 #\"The Man in the Moon\" \u2013 2:13 #\"Animal Kingdom\" \u2013 12:13 ==Personnel== ===Musician=== * Adrian Belew \u2013 guitars, vocals, various instruments ===Technical=== * Adrian Belew \u2013 producer, liner notes * Ken Latchney \u2013 engineer * Stan Hertzman \u2013 photography front cover * Robert Ascroft \u2013 photography back cover == References == Category:2000 albums Category:Adrian Belew albums Category:albums produced by Adrian Belew ",
