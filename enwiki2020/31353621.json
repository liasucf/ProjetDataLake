    "text": "The Timuri or Taimuri () are a sub-tribe of the Chahar Aimaq ethnic group in Afghanistan, one of the four major Aimaq tribes which also include the Firozkohi, Taymani, and Jamshidi. The Timuri originated in western Badghis Province. They mostly speak the Aimaq dialect of Persian language, but some members of the tribe in Baghlan Province have adopted Pashto language. The Timuri or Taimuri were once the largest and most powerful of Aimaqs. They are descendant of Timur and Mughal empire. Today they live in Afghanistan and Iran. In Iran, they live in Khorasan and around Mashhad. In Afghanistan, their traditional nomadic homeland is Badghis Province, while others are settled in oases near Herat and Shindand in western Afghanistan, and near Ghazni in central Afghanistan. There is also a small group of Pashtunised pastoralist Timuri in Baghlan Province in northeastern Afghanistan. Johnathan Lee notes that in 19th century accords, the Taimuri were often confused with the Taimani, but as the Taimuri were generally a small tribe living in Persian territory, it is usually the Taimani that chroniclers intended to note. == See also == * Aimaq people * Hazara people * Tamerlane == References == Category:Aymaq Category:Ethnic groups in Badghis Province Category:Ethnic groups in Afghanistan Category:Ethnic groups in Iran Category:Modern nomads ",
