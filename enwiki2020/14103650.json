    "text": "Spirit way of a ruler from Boni in Nanjing, China. Abdul Majid Hassan (1380\u20131408 CE), also known as Maharaja Karna, allegedly was the second Sultan of Brunei. He may have ascended the Brunei throne in 1402. He was never mentioned in Salasilah Raja-Raja Brunei. A ruler from Boni named Ma Na Re Jia Na (\u9ebb\u90a3\u60f9\u52a0\u90a3) is recorded in the Ming historical record. He sent a mission to China in 1406. The Brunei History Centre suggests that this was the Brunei sultan Abdul Majid Hassan, but there is so far no evidence for this assumption. In 1408, he went to China and died in Nanjing at the age of 28, leaving a 4-year-old prince named Xiawang (\u9050\u65fa). He was buried in Nanjing. His tomb is now a tourist attraction. From the fact that Abdul Majid Hassan died in 1408 at the age of 28, we can surmise he was born in 1380. ==See also== * List of Sultans of Brunei * Sultanate of Brunei * Tomb of the King of Boni ==References== ==External links== * Sultan-Sultan Brunei * tomb of an ancient Ruler of Brunei Category:Burials in Nanjing Category:15th-century Sultans of Brunei ",
