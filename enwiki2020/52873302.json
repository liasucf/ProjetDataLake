On this day, five students who had transferred from Madison University (Colgate University) gathered to discuss their extracurricular activity at the newly formed university in Rochester, New York.

The Delphic Literary Society at the University of Rochester was founded in 1850. There were two societies at Rochester, Delphic and Pithonian, which fostered debates and other activities aimed at increasing their members' writing and public speaking skills.

But there was at least this difference between the literary societies and modern fraternities: the membership of the literary societies comprised nearly the whole student body, except for those few who had no interest in belonging to a literary society.University of Rochester Library Bulletin: The Delphic and Pithonian Societies, Volume IV, Autumn 1948, Number 1 by Rolland E.
