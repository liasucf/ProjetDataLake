    "text": "\"Carrie\" is a power ballad by the Swedish rock and roll band Europe released in 1987. It was the third single released internationally from the album The Final Countdown, and it is their highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\u2014peaking at #3 (#1 on the Radio and Records chart) during the fall of 1987. It also reached #36 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.https://www.billboard.com/music/europe The track on the B-side of the 7\" single was \"Love Chaser\". The song was written by Joey Tempest and Mic Michaeli in 1985. An early version of the song that consisted of just keyboards and vocals, was played on a tour in Sweden the same year. The demo version was similar, but the final version that was included on the album The Final Countdown included the whole band playing. On Europe tours following the band's reunion in 2003, an acoustic version of \"Carrie\" has been played, with Tempest performing the song on an acoustic guitar. In recent years, however, the band has switched back to the arrangement of the album version. A performance of the acoustic version can be found on the Live from the Dark DVD and a performance of the album version can be found on the Live at Shepherd's Bush, London DVD. ==Personnel== *Joey Tempest \u2212 vocals *John Norum \u2212 guitars *John Lev\u00e9n \u2212 bass guitar *Mic Michaeli \u2212 keyboards *Ian Haugland \u2212 drums ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1987) !Peak position |- |Austrian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|15 |- |Canada RPM Top 100 Singles |align=\"center\"|9 |- |Dutch Top 40 |align=\"center\"|14 |- |French Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|11 |- |German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|22 |- |Irish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|10 |- |Italian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|11 |- |Swiss Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|10 |- |Poland (LP3) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|22 |- |- |US Album Rock Tracks (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|35 |- |US Billboard Adult Contemporary |align=\"center\"|36 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year-end chart (1987) !Position |- |Poland (LP3) |align=\"center\"|20 |- |US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|56 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1985 songs Category:1987 singles Category:1980s ballads Category:Europe (band) songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Hard rock ballads Category:Songs written by Joey Tempest Category:Songs written by Mic Michaeli ",
