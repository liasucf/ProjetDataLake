Snorri appears as a character in the Icelandic Eyrbyggja saga. He was from the area of \u00c1lftafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in west Iceland. He was a blood-brother of Snorri go\u00f0i and comrade-in-arms with \u00deorfinnr Karlsefni. Following mild injury and outlawry resulting from a conflict with Steinthor Thorlaksson (Steinthor of Eyr), Snorri traveled to Greenland with his brother Thorleif Kimbi and perished in battle against the skr\u00e6lings, the Indigenous peoples of the Americas), during Karlsefni's trip to Vinland. ==References== ==Other sources== *Pencak, William (1995) The Conflict of Law and Justice in the Icelandic Sagas (Rodopi) ==Related Reading== *Magnusson, Magnus; P\u00e1lsson, Hermann (1965) The Vinland Sagas (Penguin) *Smiley, Jane (2001) The Sagas of the Icelanders (Viking Penguin) Category:Norse colonization of North America ",
