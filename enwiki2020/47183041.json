    "text": "The Visegr\u00e1d Battlegroup or V4 EU Battlegroup is an EU Battlegroup led by Poland, in which the other fellow Visegr\u00e1d Group countries \u2013 the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary participate. It was on standby from 1 January until 30 June 2016 and is scheduled to go on standby from 1 July until 31 December 2019 and in the first half of 2023. ==History== On 12 May 2011, Polish Defence Minister Bogdan Klich said that Poland will lead a new EU Battlegroup of the Visegr\u00e1d Group. The decision was made at the V4 defence ministers' meeting in Levo\u010da, Slovakia, and the battlegroup became operational and was placed on standby in the first half of 2016. The ministers also agreed that the V4 militaries should hold regular exercises under the auspices of the NATO Response Force, with the first such exercise to be held in Poland in 2013. The battlegroup included the members of V4 and Ukraine. On 14 March 2014, a pact was signed on a joint military body within the European Union, in response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The deal involves joint military exercises, coordinated defence procurement and joint defence development of the four central European countries. In the Bratislava Declaration of 9 December 2014, the V4 stated that, considering \"Russia\u2019s aggressive actions against Ukraine (...) V4 countries will coordinate their national positions to maximise the efforts to support Ukraine\", confirming Ukraine's participation in the Visegr\u00e1d Battlegroup in the first half of 2016. On Polish suggestion, the V4 agreed \"to form another V4 EU Battlegroup in the second semester of 2019\". The V4 are considering to keep the Battlegroup as a permanent unit after 2016, which would set a precedent. The Battlegroup is deemed the 'flagship' of intensified future \"systemic and systematic defence planning, exercises and perhaps even procurement and maintenance\" amongst the V4. In November 2018 was confirmed that the V4 Battlegroup will be reinforced by Croatia in 2019. ==Composition and equipment== The Battlegroup in 2016 consisted of around 3,700 troops: {| class=\"wikitable\" |Poland |1 870 |main manoeuvre combat forces |- |Czech Republic |728 |logisticians, helicopter unit, electronic combat team, medical unit |- |Hungary |640 |combat engineers, civil-military cooperation unit |- |Slovakia |460 |unit for protection against weapons of mass destruction |- |Ukraine |19 | |} ==See also== *Czech\u2013Slovak Battlegroup *Czech Republic\u2013Russia relations *Hungary\u2013Russia relations *Poland\u2013Russia relations *Russia\u2013Slovakia relations *Russia\u2013Ukraine relations *Ukraine\u2013European Union relations *War in Donbass *Warsaw Pact *NATO ==References== Category:Battlegroups of the European Union Category:Military of Hungary Category:Military of Poland Category:Military of Slovakia Category:Military of the Czech Republic Category:Military of Ukraine ",
