    "text": "The Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur (, often abbreviated as Dipl. Ing.) is a postgraduate degree in engineering (see Engineer's Degrees in Europe) usually awarded by the French Grandes \u00c9coles in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French Baccalaur\u00e9at. Each holder of the dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur is also conferred the title of Ing\u00e9nieur dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term 'ing\u00e9nieur' (engineer) which is less-regulated. The dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur is recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States and in the countries of the European Union (also in France). Most Grande Ecole give the opportunity to their students to join a double degree with a University (in France or abroad). Furthermore, Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur graduates can pursue a selective PhD after their engineering studies to later join academia or an industrial R&D; department. ==Accreditation== The title Ing\u00e9nieur dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 is a strictly regulated and protected by the French state. Any institution issuing the dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur must be accredited by the Commission des titres d'ing\u00e9nieur (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of Ing\u00e9nieur dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 is liable to a \u20ac15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison. Since the signing of the Bologna Process in 1999, the European Master's Degree is also conferred by the state to the holder of a dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur. The dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur is also recognized in the United States by the AACRAO since 2013 as \"Master of Science in Engineering\".Memorandum of Understanding (AACRAO - CTI) == Grandes \u00c9coles and Universities in France == France is particular in that it is mainly the Grandes \u00c9coles in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universit\u00e9s). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, Grandes \u00c9coles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with more selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide). ==Curriculum== Student engineers in Grandes \u00c9coles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum. In addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to: * courses in humanities and social sciences * courses in business administration * visits to production sites * conferences and career talks by professionals * internships and research projects ==Professional training== More than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum. Most schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish \u201cworker\u201d (blue-collar) internships, \u201csenior technician\u201d internships, and \u201cgraduate\u201d internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements. ==References== == See also== * Memorandum of understanding Category:Master's degrees Category:Education in France Category:Business qualifications ",
