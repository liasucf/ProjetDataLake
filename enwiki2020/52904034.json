Founded in 2013, the volunteers and staff nationwide have helped to provide support and resources to those affected. == Cooperations == In 2016 they partnered with Spillerforeningen, H\u00e5ndboldspillerforeningen and Danske Elitesportsud\u00f8veres Forening to help elite athletes suffering from concussion. In 2017 they partnered with Danmarks Ishockey Union and Dansk H\u00e5ndbold Forbund, in an effort to reduced the concussion injuries in Danish ice hockey and team handball. This partnership was criticised by the players organizations for being to shallow. == In the media == The organization is frequently used in the Danish media, in concussion-related topics, and has been featured in the written press extensively, as well as in television-media. Topics range from helping the patients, helping next of kin, affecting the politicians, and engaging in concussions in sport. == Chairmen == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Chairman ! Accession !
