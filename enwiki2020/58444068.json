He currently skips \"Team Bern Z\u00e4hringer Securitas Direct\" on the World Curling Tour. ==Career== ===Juniors=== Schwaller skipped the Swiss junior men's team at three straight World Junior Curling Championships. Throwing third stones, Schwaller and teammates Reto Keller, Patrick Witschonke and Michael Probst won a gold medal at the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships. After finishing the round robin with a 6\u20133 record, the team then beat Canada and Norway before defeating Scotland's Kyle Smith rink in the final. Again throwing third stones, Schwaller, Romano Meier, Patrick Witschonke and Probst returned to the World Juniors in 2015 to defend their title. They had a better round robin record this time, finishing 7\u20132, but would lose to Canada's Braden Calvert rink in the final. Now throwing fourth stones, Schwaller with teammates Meier, Witschonke and Probst represented Switzerland at the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships. The team went 6\u20133 in the round robin, but lost to Canada twice in the playoffs, and settled for fourth place. ===Men's=== Schwaller won his first World Curling Tour event at the 2018 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard. He played in three Grand Slam events (the 2018 Masters, the 2018 National and the 2019 Champions Cup) in the 2018\u201319 season, not qualifying at any of the events. His team played in three legs of the inaugural Curling World Cup. In the second leg, his team went 2\u20134; in the third leg they went 4\u20132 and in the Grand Final, they went 3\u20133. Schwaller began the 2019-20 curling season by winning the 2019 Baden Masters and the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. Later on in the Fall, he represented Switzerland at the 2019 European Curling Championships. After posting a 6-3 round robin record, he led Switzerland to defeat Denmark in the semifinals, before losing to Sweden's Niklas Edin rink in the final, settling for silver. That season he played in four Slams (the 2019 Masters, the 2019 Tour Challenge, The 2019 National, and the 2020 Canadian Open). For the first time in his career, he made it to the playoffs at a Slam, losing out to Brad Gushue in the quarterfinals at the Canadian Open. That season, he also won the 2020 Swiss Men's Curling Championship, but missed out on representing Switzerland at the 2020 World Men's Curling Championship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He won the last tour event of the season before it was cancelled due to the pandemic, the 2020 Aberdeen International Curling Championship. Schwaller and his rink won the 2020 Curling Masters Champ\u00e9ry, their first tour win of the 2020-21 curling season. ===Mixed=== Schwaller has twice skipped Team Switzerland at the World Mixed Curling Championship.
