    "text": "The FC Basel 1904\u201305 season was their twelfth season in their existence. The club's chairman was Ernst-Alfred Thalmann, who was chairman for the second consecutive year. FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof in the Quarter Kleinbasel. == Overview == Daniel Hug was team captain. The Swiss Serie A season 1904\u201305 was divided into three regional groups, east, central and west. Basel were allocated to the central group together with the Young Boys, FC Bern, Weissenb\u00fchl Bern and Old Boys Basel. This season was a sportingly very disappointing season. There were just two victories from eight games, both times against Weissenb\u00fchl Bern, the other six games all ended in defeats. Basel landed in second last position in the group table, scoring 18 and conceding 20 goals. In the central group Young Boys Bern and the Old Boys Basel ended the season level on points as they did the year before and so a play-off match was arranged. This time the Young Boys won the play-off with 2\u20131 and therefore they qualified for the finals (see also foot note below). == Players == ;Definite squad members ;Probable squad members == Results == === Serie A === ==== Central group league table ==== NB: the match FC Basel - Young Boys Bern ended with the final score 3-4. Falsely, however, the result was originally reported as a 4-4 draw. Thus Old Boys would have finished in first position and were nominated as participants for the finals. After the mistake was noticed the W-D-L records and points totals in the league table were corrected and the necessary play-off match was arranged. However, the total goals remained without modification and consequently this leads to the fact that most older sources list the goal records for Young Boys and FC Basel as 35-11 and 19-20 respectively. Obviously this is arithmetically incorrect. ==See also== * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons == Sources and references == * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2014/2015.
