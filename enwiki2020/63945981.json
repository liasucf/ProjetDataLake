    "text": "An isolation pod is a capsule which is used to provide medical isolation for a patient. Examples include the Norwegian EpiShuttle and the USAF's Transport Isolation System (TIS) or Portable Bio-Containment Module (PBCM), which are used to provide isolation when transporting patients by air. Isolation devices were developed in the 1970s for the aerial evacuation of patients with Lassa fever. In 2015, Human Stretcher Transit Isolator (HSTI) pods were used for the aerial evacuation of health workers during the Ebola virus epidemic in Guinea. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's NHS hospitals set up separate reception areas, which were called isolation pods, but these were typically temporary accommodation such as a portacabin or tent, without special technical features, just being located at a distance from the permanent facilities.
