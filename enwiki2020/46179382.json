    "text": "Marko Aleksejev (born February 14, 1979 in Tartu) is a retired Estonian high jumper. He was selected to compete for the Estonian squad in the men's high jump at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and also trained throughout his athletic career for Audentese Sport Club () in Tallinn, under his personal coach Allan Eleranna. In 2005, Aleksejev recorded his personal best jump at 2.28 m from the International High Jump Meet in B\u00fchl, Germany. Aleksejev qualified for the Estonian squad in the men's high jump at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Three months before the Games, he cleared 2.27 m on his legal attempt to attain the exact Olympic B-height and assure a place on the Estonian track and field team from the European High Jump Meet in Herzogenbuchsee, Switzerland. Aleksejev elected to strenuously pass a single attempt at 2.10 and 2.15, until he could not overhaul the 2.20-metre barrier with all three misses, leaving him in a thirty-first place tie with Spain's Javier Bermejo at the end of the qualifying round. ==References== ==External links== * *ESBL Profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Estonian male high jumpers Category:Olympic athletes of Estonia Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Tartu ",
