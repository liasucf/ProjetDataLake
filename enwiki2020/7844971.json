The call sign stood for \"World's Greatest Automotive Zone,\" which was a nod to Studebaker Automobiles, headquartered and manufactured in South Bend. On September 9, 1925, the call letters became WSBT. This call sign stands for the South Bend Tribune, a daily newspaper that once owned the radio station. In the 1930s, WSBT was broadcasting on 1350 kilocycles, powered at 500 watts. It was a CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying its dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 30 After the passage of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, WSBT changed frequencies to its current 960 kHz. The move was coupled with a power boost to 1,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 94 In the 1950s, WSBT increased its power to the current 5,000-watt output. ===WSBT-TV and WSBT-FM=== In 1952, WSBT-TV first signed on. Because WSBT 960 was a CBS Radio affiliate, Channel 22 was affiliated with CBS Television. As network programming moved to TV, WSBT 960 switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports. 101.5 WSBT-FM was added in 1962.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-56 At first it simulcast WSBT 960. In the late 1960s, WSBT-FM began separate programming, airing beautiful music. In 1984, the station switched to locally programmed AC music, with the call letters becoming WNSN, as \"Sunny 101.5.\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-94 ===Talk and Sports=== As music listening switched from AM to FM, 960 WSBT began adding more talk programming and reducing music. By the 1990s, the station was all talk, sports and news. Then as the station moved through the 2010s, WSBT shifted to more sports programming, with the talk shows reduced. Currently, only one non-sports talk show is carried, the syndicated Dave Ramsey Show in late afternoons. Schurz Communications announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including WSBT, to Gray Television for $442.5 million. The sale, which ended 93 years of ownership by the company, separated WSBT radio from both the station's longtime sister newspaper, the South Bend Tribune (which Schurz initially kept), and WSBT-TV (which was sold separately due to Gray's existing ownership of WNDU-TV). Though Gray initially intended to keep Schurz' radio stations, on November 2, it announced that Mid-West Family Broadcasting would acquire WSBT and Schurz' other South Bend radio stations for $5.5 million. The sale to Mid-West was consummated on February 16, 2016. ===Translator 96.1 FM=== On March 30, 2012, WSBT began broadcasting on an FM translator at 96.1 MHz in South Bend. The translator had previously been owned and operated by Friends of Christian Radio, Inc. and repeated the Christian Contemporary programming of 104.7 WFRN-FM in Elkhart.WSBT Radio adds FM signal South Bend Tribune.
