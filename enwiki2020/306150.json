    "text": "The suffix -onym, in English and other languages, means \"word, name\", and words ending in -onym refer to a specified kind of name or word, most of which are classical compounds. For example, an acronym is a word formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term (as radar). The use of -onym words provides a means of classifying, often to a fine degree of resolution, sets of nouns with common attributes. In some words, the -onym form has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the \"o\". In the examples ananym and metanym, the correct forms (anonym and metonym) were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as hypernym and characternym, are typically incorrectly formed neologisms for which there are more traditional words formed in -onym (hyperonym and charactonym). The English suffix -onym is from the Ancient Greek suffix (\u014dnymon), neuter of the suffix (\u014dnymos), having a specified kind of name, from the Greek (\u00f3noma), Aeolic Greek \u1f44\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 (\u00f3nyma), \"name\". The form -\u014dnymos is that taken by \u00f3noma when it is the end component of a bahuvrihi compound, but in English its use is extended to tatpurusa compounds. The suffix is found in many modern languages with various spellings. Examples are: Dutch synoniem, German Synonym, Portuguese sin\u00f3nimo, Russian \u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c (sinonim), Polish synonim, Finnish synonyymi, Indonesian sinonim, Czech synonymum. According to a 1988 studyScheetz, Names' Names, p. 1 of words ending in -onym, there are four discernible classes of -onym words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, occurring in particular in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) nonce words. Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., eponym and cryptonym). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernible (e.g., necronym and penthonym). New words are sometimes created, the meaning of which duplicating existing terms. On occasion, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles. ==Words that end in -onym== * acronym: considered to be a \"word\" in its original sense formed from the initials of one or more words that is pronounceable like a normal word, such as NATO, sometimes in distinction to initialism; reflecting a historical development from its component word initials * agoronym: a name of a square or a marketplace. * agronym: a name of a field or a plain. * allonym: an author's name of another person's, often a well-known person's, name; an alternative term for a pseudonym * anacronym: an acronym so well-established that its origin as an abbreviation is no longer widely known and its component initials are in danger of no longer being recognized (a blend of anachronism and acronym) * andronym: a man's name or a word derived from a man's name; the name of the husband, taken on by the wife; a male name adopted by a woman * anonym: something created anonymously, or its creator; an unknown author; this term now generally replaced by pseudonym * anepronym: a portmanteau of anacronym and eponym; an original eponym of a trademark term that becomes so well established that it is used to define other objects that share its own definition (e.g., aspirin) * anthroponym: a name of a human being; as reflected in surnames or proper names of people * anthropotoponym: a toponym (place name) that is derived from an anthroponym * antonym: a word with the exact opposite meaning of another word; an antithesis: often shown in opposite word pairs such as \"high\" and \"low\" (compare with \"synonym\") * apronym: a word which, as an acronym or backronym, has a meaning related to the meaning of the words constituting the acronym or backronym; such as PLATO for \"Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching\" alluding to Plato, the philosopher and teacher * aptronym: a name appropriate to its owner's occupation or physical properties, such as \"Goldsmith\" or \"Longman\" (compare with \"charactonym\") \u2014 coined by Franklin P.
