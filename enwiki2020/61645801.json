He was also an Indologist, publishing translations of Indian works including the Siddantasiromani, an astronomical text, and Vajrasuci, an ancient text against Brahminism. Wilkinson was born in Crosby-Ravensworth, Cumbria, son of James and Nanny n\u00e9e Eggleston and went to India after receiving training at Haileybury College. He started working in India Writer from 1822, an assistant to the collector of south Konkan from 1824, an assistant Resident at Nagpur from 1826, and lastly as a Political Agent in Bhopal from 1836. He was a proponent of education in Indian languages and opposed William Bentinck on anglicism. He interacted with Indian scholars and came to learn of Bhaskara's 12th century Siddantasiromani, an astronomical text and worked on translating it into English. He found it to be very advanced, with a heliocentric model which contrasted with the Puranas which promoted a geocentric, flat-earth view. Wilkinson worked with Bapu Deva Sastri (Narasimha Deva Paranjpe 1821\u20131890) who he appointed from Pune to the Benares Sanskrit College. Wilkinson also wrote against female infanticide, supported widow remarriage and translated the Vajrasuci, an anti-Brahminical text. ==References== == External links == * Wujra Soochi Category:British Indologists Category:1805 births Category:1841 deaths ",
