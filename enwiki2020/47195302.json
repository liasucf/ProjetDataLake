It is a class 1 railway station on the Southern Line. On the premises, there is an old 305 Unit Baldwin steam locomotive on display. Hua Hin Station has been considered to be the most beautiful station in Thailand. Therefore, it is popular as a landmark and photo spots of Hua Hin for visitors. == History == The Southern Line third phase between Cha-am Station to Hua Hin opened in November 1911, and the line continued to Wang Phong Station in January 1914. The original station building was built in 1910, and rebuilt in 1926, by Prince Purachatra Jayakara (former commander of the Royal State Railways of Siam) to the current Victorian building today. The design was taken from the planned Siam Rat Museum Expo, intended to be built in 1925 at Lumphini Park, but was never built due to the death of King Vajiravudh and the cancellation of the expo by King Prajadhipok. In 1967, Colonel Saeng Chulacharit (former minister of the State Railway of Thailand) coordinated the relocation of the Sanam Chandra Palace Railway Pavilion from Sanam Chandra Palace, to Hua Hin and it was renamed to \"Phra Mongkut Klao Pavilion\". Nowadays, it is one of the main attractions at the station. ==Train services== * Special Express 43/44 Bangkok-Surat Thani-Bangkok * Special Express 45/46 Bangkok-PadangBesar- Bangkok (Pdg Besar to Butterworth now electrified KTM Commuter service, since Dec 2016) * Special Express 37/38 Bangkok-Sungai Kolok-Bangkok * Ordinary 261/262 Bangkok-Hua Hin-Bangkok * Rapid 171/172 Bangkok-Sungai Kolok-Bangkok * Rapid 169/170 Bangkok-Yala-Bangkok * Express 83/84 Bangkok-Trang-Bangkok * Rapid 173/174 Bangkok-Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok * Rapid 167/168 Bangkok- Kantang-Bangkok * Express 85/86 Bangkok-Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok * Special Express 39/40 Bangkok-Surat Thani-Bangkok * Special Express 41/42 Bangkok- Yala-Bangkok * Ordinary 251/252 Bang Sue Junction-Prachuap Khiri Khan-Bang Sue Junction * Ordinary 254/255 Lang Suan-Thon Buri-Lang Suan * Rapid 177/178 Thon Buri-Lang Suan-Thon Buri == References == * * * * * * \u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e35 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07 \u0e1e.\u0e28. 2469 Category:Railway stations in Thailand Category:Buildings and structures in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province Category:Railway stations opened in 1911 Category:ASA Architectural Conservation Award recipients ",
