    "text": "Ivan Luka\u010devi\u0107 (, ; 1711\u201312), known as Podgori\u010danin (), was a Russian Imperial captain of Serb origin from Podgorica (now in Montenegro) that participated in planning of a Balkan Orthodox uprising with Russian aid against the Ottoman Empire. He was sent with Russian colonel of Serb origin, Mikhail Miloradovich (presumably the grandfather of Mikhail Miloradovich), to deliver documents issued by emperor Peter the Great (and written by diplomat Sava Vladislavich, another Serb in Russian service) on 3 March 1711 that called the Balkan Orthodox to rise up against the Ottomans during the Pruth River Campaign. Miloradovi\u0107 and Luka\u010devi\u0107 arrived at Cetinje and delivered them to metropolitan Danilo, who had them read at a Montenegrin church assembly. This was the first Russian delegation to Montenegro. Danilo, Miloradovi\u0107 and Luka\u010devi\u0107 then organized military operations (such as the attack on Nik\u0161i\u0107). In September 1712, Luka\u010devi\u0107 left Montenegro and headed for Russia. However, he was left in Berlin. ==See also== * Andrei Miloradovich * Nikolay Depreradovich * Ivan Adamovich * Ilya Mikhailovich Duka * Avram Ratkov * Nikolay Bogdanov * Matija Zmajevi\u0107 * Semyon Zorich * Peter Tekeli * Georgi Emmanuel * Simeon Pi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 * Jovan Albanez * Jovan \u0160evi\u0107 * Anto Gvozdenovi\u0107 * Fedor Yakovlevich Mirkovich * Marko Ivelich ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:18th-century Serbian people Category:18th-century Russian military personnel Category:Serbian military leaders Category:Imperial Russian Army personnel Category:Imperial Russian people of Serbian descent Category:18th-century deaths Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Podgorica Category:Serbs of Montenegro Category:Ottoman emigrants to the Russian Empire ",
