    "text": "The Roseau\u2013South Junction Border Crossing connects the cities of Roseau, Minnesota and South Junction, Manitoba on the Canada\u2013United States border. It is connected by Minnesota State Highway 310 in Roseau County on the American side and Manitoba Provincial Road 310 in the Rural Municipality of Piney on the Canadian side. The crossing was established in 1948, and Canada is still using the border station it completed in 1953, which is located about a half mile north of the border. The US rebuilt its border station in 2004. The new facility includes an outdoor gun range. ==See also== * List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings == References == Category:Canada\u2013United States border crossings Category:1948 establishments in Manitoba Category:1948 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Roseau County, Minnesota ",
