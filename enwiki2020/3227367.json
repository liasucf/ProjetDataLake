    "text": "Saint Disibod (619\u2013c.700) was an Irish monk and hermit, first mentioned in a martyrologium by Hrabanus Maurus (9th century). Hildegard of Bingen around 1170 composed a Vita of Saint Disibod Included in Throop (trans.), Three Lives and a Rule (Charlotte, VT: MedievalMS, 2010). He is commemorated on 8 September. According to Hildegard's Vita, Disibod came to the Frankish Empire in 640 as a missionary, accompanied by his disciples Giswald, Clemens and Sallust. They were active in the Vosges and Ardennes, until, guided by a dream, Disibod built a cell at the confluence of the rivers Nahe and Glan, the location of the later monastery of Disibodenberg. ==Notes== ==External links== * \"St. Disen, or Disibode, of Ireland, Bishop and Confessor\", Butler's Lives of the Saints Category:619 births Category:700 deaths Category:7th-century Frankish saints Category:7th-century Irish people Category:Irish expatriates in Germany Category:Medieval Irish saints on the Continent Category:Colombanian saints Category:People from Bad Kreuznach (district) ",
