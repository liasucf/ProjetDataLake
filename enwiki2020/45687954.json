This object was worshipped or constituted a tangible representation of a cult image. The Western Slavs transcribed and pronounced the word as ba\u0142wan (), which is its contemporary and old Polish lexical manifestation, whereas most Southern Slavs and the Eastern Slavs used the just slightly differently-vowelled bolvan (). In the Kyrgyz language of Central Asia, geographically remote from the territories Slavs are today identified with in Europe, balvan is a \"strongman\" or a hero, whereas in Persian, pahlev\u0101n denotes a militant or a veteran, as well as the plinth or boundary marker erected in his or her honor, or even a cairn, and, by extension, a fool. That latter meaning, at first secondary, became primary after Christianity was imposed on the Slavs, making ba\u0142wan acquire a distinctly pejorative primary meaning. Some suggest that the Slavs share throughout their idioms such as they have evolved apart this single entity -- a common term for all cult objects in the form of a statue or cairn -- might suggest that idolatry spread early among the Slavic peoples, perhaps when they came in contact with Turkic peoples or Iranian. A word with similar etymology is the Slavic word for God (when capitalized) or deity, b\u00f3g, a cognate of Sanskrit \"bhaga\"/Iranian or Persian bag. In India the concept of a deity or god is often relayed with the word bhagvan, variously transcribed as bhagwan. A derived term from ba\u0142wan is the Polish word for idolatry: ba\u0142wochwalstwo. == See also == * Svetovid * Idolatry * Early Slavs * Slavic neopaganism * Christianization of the Slavs == References == == Further reading == * Category:Slavic mythology Category:Slavic paganism ",
