Cleenwerck, M. De Wachter, B. Hoste, D. Janssens and J. Swings ==Microvirgula Dispute== Several studies show that Aquaspirillum dispar and Microvirgula aerodenitrificans have a rDNA similarity of greater that 99%. It has been proposed that the name Aquaspirillum dispar cease to be relevant because Microvirgula aerodenitrificans is the type species of Microvirgula. However, no official action has been made, so Aquaspirillum dispar is still relevant. ==References== Aquaspirillum Category:Bacteria described in 1973 ",
