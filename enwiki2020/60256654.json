    "text": "Wolf Hollow is a young adult novel written by Lauren Wolk, published by Dutton Children's Books in 2016. It is set in rural western Pennsylvania during the autumn of 1943 and describes how the protagonist, Annabelle \"learned how to lie\" and \"that what I said and what I did mattered\" in relation to two interlopers in her life: the bully Betty Glengarry, and the mysterious drifter Toby. It was named a Newbery Honor book in 2016. ==Plot summary== The novel is narrated by twelve-year-old Annabelle McBride, who lives on a farm with her family and walks with her two younger brothers, James and Henry to school in the town of Wolf Hollow. A new girl, Betty Glengarry, started attending the same school, in October 1943; she was sent to Wolf Hollow to live with her grandparents because, as rumor has it, she has been deemed 'incorrigible' by the city. One morning, Betty confronts Annabelle on their way to school, threatening to beat Annabelle or her younger brothers if Annabelle does not give her something nice; because Annabelle's house has a purple-colored glass window, Betty believes their family is extremely wealthy. Several years earlier, shortly after the start of the Great Depression, a reclusive drifter named Toby had arrived in town, staying in an abandoned smokehouse living on berries and game. Little is known about him, except that he was a veteran of World War I and that he had borrowed Annabelle's family's camera on a semi- permanent basis. He also carries three large guns with him wherever he goes, which causes suspicion within many people\u2019s minds. Annabelle takes a penny from her piggy bank for Betty, but Betty refuses it and beats Annabelle with a stick. Later she kills a quail in front of Annabelle; the ensuing confrontation is witnessed by Toby, setting events into motion that result into Betty getting extremely angry at Toby and wants to get revenge eventually. Later that day, Annabelle is standing in the road with her friend Ruth, talking to Mr. Ansel, a friendly local man, who also happens to be German. A rock comes flying from the hillside above and hits Ruth in the eye, resulting in the loss of her eye. This nor the confrontation with Toby deterred Betty from her bullying of Annabelle, until Annabelle stands up to Betty. In reply, Betty and her friend (and possible love interest, street name crush) Andy, string a sharpened wire across the pathway through the hollow. This wire then cuts Annabelle's little brother James across the forehead. Although James is fine, this still leads to Annabelle sharing Betty's cruelty with her parents, who, concerned, go to have a talk with Betty and her grandparents (who she lives with). During this conversation, Betty claims that she saw Toby throw the rock that hit Ruth in the eye. She claims that she and Andy were up in the belfry and that's how she saw it. The Glengarrys are angry at the McBrides for suggesting that Betty would hurt Annabelle, and believe Betty that she saw Toby throw the rock. However, Annabelle's teacher, Mrs. Taylor later reveals that Betty and Andy couldn't have been in the belfry on the day Ruth got hurt, as she had kicked them out a few days previous to that and the door had remained locked ever since. This is to be investigated, when in a storm, Betty goes missing, and in the pictures Toby took, Annabelle's Aunt Lily, who has always distrusted Toby, finds a picture taken from the hillside the day Ruth was hurt. What they later learn is that Toby is also missing, and Lily suggests that Toby might've taken Betty. Refusing to believe that this is the case, Annabelle sneaks out in the night and finds Toby at the smokehouse. On her way she thinks she hears a porcupine. She convinces Toby to come with her, and hide in her barn until things get sorted out, and she provides him with food and drink and a book, Treasure Island. In a moment of weakness, Toby tells Annabelle about his experiences in the war, including how he scarred his hand, but Annabelle doesn't understand much of it. She also suggests that Toby cut his hair and beard, the result being that he is unrecognizable. This, combined with the porcupine she heard earlier gives Annabelle an idea, that Betty might've fallen down the well outside Toby's smokehouse, and that Toby, in his newly shorn disguise could be the one to save her, thus restoring his name. Toby, under the alias Jordan, goes down the well to rescue Betty, who has fallen in and become impaled on a pipe. He successfully gets her out and she is immediately rushed to the hospital, while Annabelle's father invites Toby/Jordan home for dinner, which he accepts to, but keeps his gloves on, so as to hide his scars. Lily is immediately smitten with Jordan, and has flirtatious conversation throughout dinner. Everyone excepting Annabelle and her parents go to bed. Eventually Annabelle's mother, Sarah, figures out that Jordan is Toby, and Annabelle explains what she did. They also receive a report from the hospital saying that Betty is blaming Toby incorrectly for pushing her down the well, but it makes no sense to the witnesses, as he was the first to spot her and save her life. Annabelle's parents agree to let Toby stay and help fix the barn, and they hide all of his things in the barn loft. Annabelle meanwhile makes plans for forcibly getting Andy to reveal that Betty is lying about everything she claims Toby did, but before she can put her plan in action, James and Henry find Toby's hat and camera in the loft and Lily calls the police. Toby leaves without saying goodbye. Annabelle goes back to the barn that night, and runs into Toby, who tells her he would have liked to have had a daughter like her before vanishing for good. Annabelle notices that he left one of his guns, the only one that worked. The next morning, the family receives word that Betty Glengarry has died from her infection. Over the phone, Annabelle gets Andy to confess that Betty threw the rock that hurt Ruth, and doubt arises about whether Toby pushed Betty down the well or not. Annabelle wakes up early the next morning and her mother informs her that Toby was found, shot, and killed. She says he pulled one of his guns off his back, suggesting that he wanted to die. The rest of the family discovers that Jordan was Toby when they see Annabelle wearing his gloves. They also discover that he left his Congressional Medal of Honor in one of the pockets. Annabelle goes to Toby's smokehouse one more time, and takes the pictures that are on the walls. She suggests to Henry and James that they take turns with the camera, and while James declines, Henry accepts, suggesting that Annabelle and Henry's relationship might flourish in the future. The book ends with Betty's and Toby's funerals, and gives us the final image of Annabelle sitting beside Toby's grave, telling him about her life. ==Development== Wolk's family farm inspired the setting for Wolf Hollow; her mother and two uncles lived on the farm and walked to school. In addition, Wolk stated she was inspired by contemporary events, as she \"hoped to create through Betty a microcosm of what was happening in the war. A ferocious bully and his sidekicks were murdering and terrorizing the world. Bringing out the worst in people, and sometimes the best. And Betty was doing the same on a much smaller scale in Wolf Hollow.\" ==Reception== In 2017, the American Library Association named Wolf Hollow to its list of Newbery Honor winners, alongside Ashley Bryan's Freedom Over Me and Adam Gidwitz's The Inquisitor's Tale. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Young adult novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:2016 American novels Category:2016 children's books Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania ",
