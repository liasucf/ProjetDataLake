Due to not having a home rink for the season, Yale began with a series of road games mostly against Canadian colleges during the winter break. The delay in completion of the Philadelphia Ice Palace forced the Elis to play only one further game before February. Once the Ice Palace was ready Yale managed to finish out their slate of conference games for the first season of the Triangular Hockey League. The were able to defeat Princeton twice but fell to Harvard in both matches, finishing 2nd in the Triangular League. Yale played seven of their nine games under the 6-on-6 with 3 periods format with only the first Princeton and second Harvard game being played at their more usual 7-on-7 with two halves. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Category:Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey seasons Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs ",
