    "text": "Matt Farley (born June 3, 1978) is an American filmmaker, musician, and songwriter who has released over 20,000 songs .Wild, Matt (7 March 2019). The guy who wrote \"Milwaukee Poop Poop Poop\" (and 20,000 other songs) wrote a song about me and now I'm complete, Milwaukee Record His music is released under a variety of band names. ==Biography== Farley grew up in Massachusetts and graduated from Providence College in Rhode Island. Around 2008, he discovered that songs with silly titles from his band \"Moes Haven\" (which he had streaming on Spotify) were the only ones generating revenue. He soon began writing and recording songs about everything and anything that he thought people might search for. His band names, which exceed 70, often correlate to the subject matter of their songs. For example, \"Papa Razzi and the Photogs\" release albums filled with songs about celebrities, and \"The Hungry Food Band\" releases songs about food. Thousands of songs celebrate birthdays with different names. Over 500 songs are \"prom proposals\" songs each sung with a different name. Yet another series of albums are composed completely of songs about towns within a U.S. state or other country, with lyrics derived from reading Wikipedia articles on each town. However, his most lucrative band is likely the \"Toilet Bowl Cleaners\", who sing songs about fecal matter. According to Farley, one song that contains only the word \"poop\" repeated over and over generates $500 in streaming revenue every month likely in part because children request it from Alexa or other devices. Farley earned over $23,000 in 2013 from his song catalog. Farley also writes custom songs, generating $2,000 or more in revenue per month. The Reply All podcast has featured Farley multiple times and used his custom songs. Much of Farley's output is piano-and-vocals compositions. Albums can run to 100 songs in length. Some of his albums, even from a band such as The Toilet Bowl Cleaners, contain more serious output; that band's 11th album is titled Mature Love Songs, none of which are about fecal matter. Farley's serious and non- lucrative albums are called \"no jokes\" albums.Decloux, Justin (11 June 2018). The Best Music of Matt Farley (in Five Albums), Film Trap In 2016, Farley performed \"Used to Be a Pizza Hut\", a song topic derived from internet traffic about how re-purposed locations of the American chain restaurant still retain their distinctive roof style, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. ==Music label and films== Farley's output is released under the label Motern Media, and he is rarely identified directly by name. Farley often includes his personal phone number in his lyrics, which yields calls and texts from fans surprised to find the number is real. Farley has made several low-budget comedy-horror films, primarily starring his family and friends, with titles such as Freaky Farley (2007), Don't Let the Riverbeast Get You (2012), Slingshot Cops (2016). He is the subject of a 2018 Australian documentary, Lessons from a Middle Class Artist. He performs an annual five-and-a-half-hour concert \"extravaganza\" in Danvers, Massachusetts. == References == ==External links== * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Songwriters from Massachusetts Category:People from Danvers, Massachusetts Category:Providence College alumni Category:21st-century American musicians ",
