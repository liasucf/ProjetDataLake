    "text": "Soma Games' company logo Soma Games is an American third-party video game developer based in Newberg, Oregon. Founded in 2005 by Chris Skaggs, Rande Bruhn, and John Bergquist, Soma originally produced mobile games based on their own original properties such as G and Windup Robots, but in 2018 became the first studio to create a licensed game based on the popular Redwall series of books. Soma Games emphasizes its Christian company culture, and often describes itself as a Christian video game company that does not make video games specifically about Christianity. == History == The idea for Soma Games was conceived by Christopher Skaggs, a web developer from Newberg, Oregon. Skaggs has claimed that he first developed the concept for the company in 2005 after attending the nearby Christian Game Developers Conference and then being be interviewed on a late-night television show in Boston, Massachusetts about the \"Christian video game\" sector of the video game industry. Skaggs has said that these events were what directly inspired him to begin creating the basic materials for his own video games company called Soma Games. The two other founding members of Soma Games, Rande Bruhn and John Bergquist, began mentoring and helping Skaggs in 2005 after meeting him at a Christian retreat event called Bootcamp NW. It was during this time that Soma developed the ideas for its first games, GRoG, Dark Glass, and The Race. These ideas were put on hiatus for a time due to external circumstances in Skaggs' life, but in 2008 Skaggs and his colleagues began brainstorming ideas again. In October 2008 John Bergquist began volunteering more actively, helping Skaggs write down ideas and establish Soma as an actual company (though due to financial constraints he was not hired as an official employee until 2011), and Rande Bruhn followed as an official business partner two months later. In December 2008, Soma Games received its first amount of funding began coding its first projects. === Arc series === Entering 2009, Soma consisted of four employees (with three additional remote \"contractors\" giving their time both paid and unpaid.) Throughout its earliest years, Soma Games focused on fleshing out their three-game concepts as well as gaining publicity and funding. They soon developed a fourth game concept, this being for a full series they decided to call \"Arc.\" The team decided that the Arc series would consist of three small iPhone games or \"episodes\" that would act as a prologue for a larger console game eponymously titled Arc. As a way to obtain early funding from fans, Soma released a computer wallpaper featuring concept art from their Dark Glass game that players could buy with the promise that they could later \"redeem\" this wallpaper for a free copy of Arc when it was released. In March 2009, the company began selling merchandise through CafePress.com. The first game in the Arc series, G, was announced on February 11, 2009. It entered beta in March and was submitted to the Apple App Store in April, eventually releasing on April 25, 2009.Soma Games. (14, April 2010). OK - G is now off to Apple and in review. w00t! Check out the new video trailer.... [Facebook post]. Retrieved from https://www.facebook.com/SomaGames/posts/71923701218 The app received very positive reviews upon launch, with reviewers praising its visuals, storyline, art, and voice-acting but also criticizing some technical bugs present in the initial build and the game's tendency to become boring quickly. Software updates were continued to be put out for G throughout the rest of the year. On June 17, 2009, Soma revealed plans for the sequel to G, titled F, in an interview with the German app review site pressHOME. In the same way that the name \"G\" stood for its main gameplay mechanic of \"Gravity,\" \"F\" was said to refer to the sequel's main gameplay mechanic of \"Force.\" Screenshots were released to news outlets a couple of months later and the title was revealed to be a 3D game rather than following the 2D approach of its predecessor. Eventually it was also revealed that the third mobile game preceding the series' finale of Arc would be titled \"E.Soma Games. (15, July 2009). OK, so this cool science story is just so up our alley. Asteroids, Icetroids! Even the artists image got me excited about the story we are telling in G,F,E and ultimately ARC. Enjoy [Facebook post].

In 2009, G won the \"Best iPhone Game\" award at the conference. In October 2009 Soma partnered with the band Skillet to give away free IPod Touches with copies of G on them.Soma Games.

Show up and you could win an 8GB iPod Touch with G pre-installed. [Facebook post]. Retrieved from https://www.facebook.com/SomaGames/posts/161110052198 ==== Relationship with Intel ==== In December 2009, Soma began partnering with Intel Corporation to be one of the initial developers for their upcoming AppUp app store. A Flash port of G was developed by the team in approximately two and a half weeks, and launched as one of 22 initial games on the AppUp platform. In a series of blog posts, Chris Skaggs conveyed his excitement to be one of the original app developers on an app store that would be pre-installed on certain computers. With the release of their 2.0 update for G in March 2010, Soma ran a contest for players to win a then-unreleased IPad by reaching the highest score in G.Skaggs, Chris. \u201cG 2.0 is live! :: iPad Giveaway Contest Mar 3-16.\u201d TouchArcade Promo Codes and Contests forum, 23 February 2010. https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/g-2-0-is-live-ipad-giveaway-contest- mar-3-16.46052/ G was ported to the BlackBerry PlayBook in April 2011 to be among the device's launch catalog,Soma Games.

Retrieved from https://www.facebook.com/SomaGames/posts/181117451936189 and a Steam port for the game was also considered but ultimately cancelled. In order to develop the PC port for G, development of F was put on hold, but was picked up again the next year. Gameplay footage of F was released in October 2010 featuring a 3D space environment running on the Unity engine, and the game was given the subtitle \"The Storm Riders.\" Actress and video game journalist Lisa Foiles was also announced to be working on the game's story as a writer, and Lisa was cited as responsible for adding cutscenes to the game's script.Soma Games. (2, December 2010). So you may be asking yourself, \"Why is F being delayed?\" I'll tell you why - because somewhere late in production somebody had the bright idea to include cutscenes into the script (@lisafoiles) and we all thought that was awesome. But art takes time...still, I'm starting to feel like the delay will be well worth it. What do you think? [Facebook post]. Retrieved from https://www.facebook.com/SomaGames/photos/a.94773138084/461807963084/ However, despite releasing many pieces of concept art, teasers, and gameplay footage, the release date for F: The Storm Riders was continually pushed back, and the release for the game (as well as its two sequels) was eventually put on an indefinite hiatus. ===Wind Up Robots and continuing Arc=== At the same time as development on F was taking place, Soma Games was also reportedly working on another of their initial game ideas, GRoG, which stood for \"that Giant Robot Game you have.\" During development, work on the game evolved into working on a prequel, and on May 31, 2011 this prequel was announced to be released later in the year under the title \"Wind Up Robots.\"Soma Games. (31, May 2011). We are pleased to announce the first game since G. Windup Robots will be available July 7th! The game initially will be available on the Intel Appup store and iTunes with the Blackberry Playbook and other stores to follow. [Facebook post].

In 2012 Soma participated in the Intel Ultimate Coder: Ultrabook Challenge to use the same assets from Wind Up Robots to make a spinoff game called Wind Up Football in six weeks. Wind Up Football was added as a gamemode in an update to the original Wind Up Robots game at first, but was later released to appstores as a standalone game. Going into 2012, during one of their weekly update YouTube videos, Soma announced that they planned to continue the Arc and GRoG storylines that they had developed. In order to remind players of the Arc storyline, Soma announced that they were remaking the original G: Into the Rain for X and X as G Prime. === Redwall series === In 2011, an associate had called Soma's founder Chris Skaggs to inform him that he had acquired the master license to the Redwall series from the author of the books, Brian Jacques (who had previously been very guarded about sharing the license with anyone). Chris and his associate entered into talks of developing a small mobile game for the Redwall brand, as mobile gaming was where the Soma team had the most experience. In 2013, a Kickstarter was set up to fund the Redwall game, and in 2018 the game was released on Steam for Mac and PC. == Company culture == The management and staff of Soma Games are vocal Christians, and are very open about their religious affiliation. However, while the company is based on Christian values, they have often clearly expressed that they do not create \"Christian video games,\" that is, video games that are explicitly based around Christian stories and content. Soma Games have often described themselves as being the \"C. S. Lewis of video games,\" taking inspiration from the prolific Christian author by making video games with Christian values and themes, but that are not specifically using Christian stories and tropes. In its early days, Soma had to overcome the obstacle of funding its games to try and deliver polished content rather than manufacturing its earliest products on a minimal budget \u2014 a challenge they cited as a point of failure for many startup Christian video game developers. The company founder, Chris Skaggs, has mentioned many times that he values artistic beauty and a good story in games over impressive new gameplay. He has also many times mentioned his company's emphasis on commanding rest, contrary to the typical expectation of video game companies to implement \"crunch time.\" == Code-Monkeys == Soma Games also ran a sister brand called \"Code-Monkeys\" in which their same employees would do \"work-for- hire\" developing games and software not of original IP's. This was done to provide income in-between the release of their larger projects published under Soma Games. In June 2011, the Soma Games developers released the game Bok Choy Boy for the Intel AppUp platform and iOS under the name of their sister brand, Code-Monkeys. This game was based around the popular Chinese Bok Choy Boy toy line. == Games published == === As Soma Games === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Title !Release date !Notes |- |G: Into the Rain |April 25, 2009 (iPhone) January 7, 2010 (AppUp) April 14, 2011 (BlackBerry PlayBook) |The first game in the Arc series. |- |Windup Robots |December 14, 2011 (Android, iOS, AppUp) |A prequel to the planned game GRoG. |- |Windup Football |2012 (Mac, PC, iOS, Android) |A spin-off of Windup Robots made for the Intel Ultimate Coder: Ultrabook Challenge. |- |The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout |September 14, 2018 (Mac, PC) | |- |The Lost Legends of Redwall: Escape the Gloomer |November 16, 2018 (Mac, PC) May 9, 2019 (Android, iOS, Alexa) |Developed in partnership with Clopas. |} As Code-Monkeys {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Title !Release date !Notes |- |Lunar Storm |November 2010 (AppUp) |A retro-game tribute. |- |Bok Choy Boy |June 2011 |Developed for Chinese markets. |- |Santa's Giftship |December 2011 |An homage to the game Zombie Gunship by Limbic Software. |} == References == Category:Video game developers Category:2005 establishments in Oregon Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon ",
