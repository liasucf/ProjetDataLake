    "text": "Nimrod Megiddo () is a mathematician and computer scientist. He is a research scientist at the IBM Almaden Research Center. His interests include optimization, algorithm design and analysis, game theory, and machine learning. He was a comparatively early researcher to propose a solution to the Bounding sphere and Smallest-circle problem. ==Education== Megiddo received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Author's profile at an article, Computer, April 2004, p. 11 ==Career and research== Megiddo received the 2014 John von Neumann Theory Prize, the 1992 ICS Prize, and is a 1992 Frederick W. Lanchester Prize recipient. In computational geometry, Megiddo is known for his prune and search and parametric search techniques both suggested in 1983N. Megiddo. Linear-time algorithms for linear programming in R3 and related problems. SIAM J. Comput., 12:759\u2013776, 1983.. and used for various computational geometric optimization problems, in particular to solve the smallest-circle problem in linear time. In 2009 he received the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Fellows award for contributions to the theory and application of mathematical programming, including parametric searches, interior point methods, low dimension Linear Programming, probabilistic analysis of the simplex method and computational game theory. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:American computer scientists Category:American operations researchers Category:Israeli operations researchers Category:John von Neumann Theory Prize winners Category:Game theorists Category:Numerical analysts Category:Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Category:Jewish systems scientists ",
