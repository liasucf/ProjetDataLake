The work was commissioned by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and violinist Anne Akiko Meyers. It was premiered December 7, 2012, with Meyers and the Pittsburgh Symphony performing under conductor Leonard Slatkin. ==Structure== The Violin Concerto has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in three continuous movements:Bates, Mason (2012). Violin Concerto: Program Note. Retrieved July 7, 2015. #Archaeopteryx #Lakebed Memories #The Rise of the Birds ==Composition== ===Background=== The Pittsburgh Symphony commissioned Bates's Violin Concerto at the behest of a recommendation from composer John Adams and principal guest conductor Leonard Slatkin. Slatkin had previously led the orchestra in a performance of Bates's Liquid Interface and lauded Bates to the symphony's vice president Bob Moir as a \"terrific young composer.\" Violinist Anne Akiko Meyers had also sought a commission from Bates, remarking before the work's premiere: Bates later spoke of the experience, saying, \"I've written a lot for strings in the orchestra, but writing for solo violin is completely different. It was like writing a one-person play in a language you don't speak. It was very intimidating at first.\" The piece was completed in the summer of 2012, with Meyers remarking, \"we were changing things right and left\u2014it was definitely an evolution.\" ===Style=== Bates described the style of the piece in the score program notes, writing: ===Instrumentation=== The piece is scored for solo violin and orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling English horn), two clarinets in B-flat (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four French horns, four trumpets in C, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, three percussionists, timpani, piano, harp, and strings. ==Reception== Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Kanny of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review praised the Violin Concerto, saying, \"The outer movements are high-energy excursions, driven by the composer's gifts for inventive rhythms, lyrical inspiration and a combination of moment-to-moment persuasiveness and feeling of formal satisfaction.\" Andrew Druckenbrod of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette lauded the work for having \"more than a few exhilarating moments,\" but criticized Bates for limiting his ambition, remarking, \"I am not begrudging Mr. Bates from going where his muse takes him. But I am concerned that the pull of tradition may be tugging on him, making him feel he needs to prove himself as a 'real' composer.\" Druckenbrod nevertheless said, \"Despite the ambitious program of the work [...] there were some compelling musical moments.\" John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune also praised the work, writing, \"If Bates' big tune smacks of the Hollywood cornfields, he won me over when the fiddle engaged in dreamy dialogues with the percussion in the middle movement, and again when the violin soared in glimmering arcs high above the full orchestra in the finale.\" John Pitcher of ArtsNash said: Pitcher added, \"Unfortunately, these melodies often come across as little more than beautiful moments in an otherwise tedious half-hour. Melodies in the concerto frequently meander without a sense of purpose or destination. The work\u2019s musical argument is likewise loose, sometimes amounting to nothing more than slow sections following fast sections.\" However, Pitcher ultimately praised the solo writing and referred to the piece asan \"important\" work. ==References== Category:Compositions by Mason Bates Category:2012 compositions Bates Category:21st-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ",
