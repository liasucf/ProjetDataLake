Both were later cleared, and thus the case is best remembered for what was an injustice. The Chamberlains were Seventh-day Adventists and an urban myth had developed that they were required to sacrifice a child as part of their religious beliefs and that the name Azaria meant \"sacrifice\". These statements are false.http://www.smh.com.au/comment/a-dingo-took-baby-azaria-chamberlain-the- case-that-shattered-faith-in-the-jury-system-20170112-gtqj6f.html *John Curtin \u2013 14th Prime Minister of Australia.

Formal investigations determined that he drowned accidentally. *Ned Kelly \u2013 Australian 19th-century bushranger, many films, books and artworks have been made about him, possibly his exploits have been exaggerated in the public eye and become something of folklore.

Kelly had made armour from stolen iron mould boards of ploughs, and came out shooting, whereupon he was shot in the legs. Some consider him as Australia's Robin Hood whiles others would disagree.

Neighboring, smaller rivers are just as old.

This campaign has become a \"founding myth\" for both Australia and New Zealand, and Anzac Day is still commemorated as a holiday in both countries. The idea that Australian soldiers were mowed down by Turkish gunfire following stupid decisions of the British commanding officers is part of the folklore, as is the escape from Gallipoli, where the Anzacs used rifles rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger to make it seem like there were still soldiers in the trenches as they were leaving. Another aspect of the ANZAC spirit is the story of Simpson and his donkey. *Gentle Annie \u2013 Name for selected especially steep sections of bush roads, difficult to climb in wet weather.

The Opera House, backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, seen from the eastern Botanic Gardens *Snowy River \u2013 immortalised in another Banjo Paterson poem, \"The Man from Snowy River\". The river has received much attention of late for now being nothing more than a trickle, and in fact has become a symbol for wider Australian interest in the health of its great rivers, particularly those in the Murray-Darling basin. *Sovereign Hill - An Open-Air Museum in Ballarat depicting an 1850s gold rush town. *St James station tunnels \u2013 The tunnel is home to many urban legends including being a secret military bunker during World War II and a large bell that sounds like Big Ben. *Sydney Harbour Bridge & Sydney Opera House \u2013 Two of Australia's most famous national landmarks.

Henderson * Eureka stockade \u2013 A miners' revolt in 1854 in Victoria, Australia against the officials supervising the gold- mining region of Ballarat, in particular, the high prices of digging licenses.
