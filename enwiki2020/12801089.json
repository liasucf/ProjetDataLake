They were enumerated as the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments. The proposed twelfth and thirteenth amendments were held to reverse differing elements of the Supreme Court's decision in the X case in which the Supreme Court held that a risk of suicide by a pregnant woman could constitute a risk to her health which would justify an abortion, and that the courts had to power to grant an injunction preventing a pregnant woman from travelling abroad for an abortion. The fourteenth amendment also related to abortion and was introduced to reverse decision by the courts in the abortion information cases. In these cases \u2014 beginning with Attorney-General (Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child) v Open Door Counselling Ltd.[1988] IR 593. \u2014 the courts had granted injunctions preventing individuals from distributing contact information for foreign abortion clinics.
