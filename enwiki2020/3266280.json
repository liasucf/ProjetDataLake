It was the smallest of six districts in the newly created county of Dyfed, and was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 by a merger of the municipal boroughs of Llanelli and Kidwelly, Burry Port urban district and Llanelli Rural District all in the former administrative county of Carmarthenshire. The district was governed by Llanelli Borough Council which was based in the town of Llanelli. The first leader of the newly formed council in 1973 was Harry J. Richards. Other leaders of the council include Michael Willis Gimblett, who served as a liberal council leader from 1976 to 1983.
