    "text": "Erik Johan Mattias \"Notan\" Norstr\u00f6m (born 2 January 1972) is a Swedish retired professional ice hockey defenceman, currently working for the AIK organization. Norstr\u00f6m began his National Hockey League career with the New York Rangers. However, he is most noted for his ten seasons as a member of the Los Angeles Kings for whom he served as team captain from 2001\u20132007; he was the team's first non-North American-born captain. Norstr\u00f6m played the final season of his NHL career for the Dallas Stars. ==Playing career== As a youngster, he played for several years in the \"talent factory\" Huddinge IK although this original club was M\u00e4larh\u00f6jden/Bred\u00e4ng Hockey. In his teens he moved from Huddinge to AIK (Stockholm), where he started playing in the senior team from 1991. He was drafted in the second round, 48th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft and began his NHL career in 1993 with that team. Norstr\u00f6m split his time in the Rangers organization between the parent club and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers. On 14 March 1996, he was traded with Nathan LaFayette, Ian Laperri\u00e8re, Ray Ferraro and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings for Marty McSorley, Jari Kurri and Shane Churla. In Los Angeles he developed into a solid stay-at-home defender and anchor of the Kings' blueline. On 1 October 2001, he was appointed team captain after Rob Blake had been traded to the Colorado Avalanche. Mattias Norstr\u00f6m warms up on 2 January 2006, at the Staples Center. During the NHL lockout in 2004\u201305, Norstr\u00f6m played with his previous Swedish team, AIK. The team was playing in the third-tier league, struggling to advance, when Norstr\u00f6m arrived. He helped lead them through the playoffs, and to secure a spot in the second tier league the following year. Norstr\u00f6m was originally appointed to the Swedish national team for the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin but had to withdraw due to injury. When Rob Blake returned to the Kings on 1 July 2006, Norstr\u00f6m called him and offered the captaincy back. Blake refused at his presentation press conference and told the media that he regarded \"Matty\" as the obvious captain and the \"core and soul\" of the Kings. Norstr\u00f6m was acquired by the Dallas Stars through a trade with the Kings on 27 February 2007, which sent defencemen Jaroslav Modr\u00fd and Johan Fransson, a 2008 first round draft pick, a 2007 second round draft pick, and a 2007 third round draft pick to Los Angeles in exchange for Norstr\u00f6m, forward Konstantin Pushkarev, a 2007 third round pick, and a 2007 fourth round pick. On 30 April 2008, he scored the game-winning goal (and first NHL playoff goal of his career) in the first overtime against the San Jose Sharks, allowing the Stars to take a 3\u20130 series lead. On 10 June 2008, Norstr\u00f6m announced his retirement from hockey. On 20 June 2011, Norstr\u00f6m joined the AIK organization as a sports manager and sounding board for Anders Gozzi. ==Career achievements== * 1992 IIHF \u2013 Silver medal World Junior Ice Hockey Championships * 1997 IIHF \u2013 Silver medal Ice Hockey World Championship * 1998 Winter Olympics * 1998 IIHF \u2013 Gold medal World Championships *1999 NHL All- Star 1999 National Hockey League All-Star Game * 2002 Winter Olympics * 2003 IIHF \u2013 Silver medal Ice Hockey World Championship *2004 NHL All-Star 2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text- align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
