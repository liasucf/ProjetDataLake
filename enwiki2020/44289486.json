    "text": "Assembly elections were held in the British Virgin Islands in 1735. ==Background== In early 1735 Governor William Matthew established a Council and Assembly for both Tortola and Virgin Gorda. Although the six-member Councils were appointed by the Governor, the nine-member Assemblies were elected.Isaac Dookhan (1975) A History of the British Virgin Islands 1672 to 1970, Caribbean University Press, p26Pearl Varlack and Norwell Harrigan (1977) The Virgins: A Descriptive and Historical Profile, The Caribbean Research Institute College of the Virgin Islands, p20 ==Electoral system== Tortola was divided into three three-member constituencies; Fat Hog Bay, Road and Saka Bay. Virgin Gorda had two constituencies, with Valley electing six members and North and South Sound electing three. Voters were generally the residents rather than the freeholders. ==Aftermath== Following the elections, it became apparent that Governor Matthew had misinterpreted his commission. As a result, the creation of the Assemblies was illegal. Matthew was reprimanded by the Lords of Trade and the Assemblies were subsequently disbanded, although the Councils continued to meet. Elections were not held again until 1773. ==References== Category:1735 in politics Category:1735 in North America Category:1730s elections in North America Category:1735 in the British Virgin Islands 1735 ",
