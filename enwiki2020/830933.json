It was created in 1903 to study and improve the West Country cider industry and became part of the University of Bristol in 1912. Later, it expanded into fruit research (particularly apples, pears, plums, strawberries and blackcurrants) and in the 1980s was redirected to work on arable crops and aspects of botany. It closed in 2003. The Research Station is known for developing Ribena a still popular vitamin C-rich drink that was widely distributed in the UK during the Second World War. ==History of LARS== The Hirst Laboratory at Long Ashton Research on cider making began privately in 1893 at Robert Neville-Grenville's farm near Glastonbury. This led to the formation of the National Fruit and Cider Institute in 1903 in fields south of the main road through Long Ashton. Frederick Lloyd was appointed Director. In 1912 the Institute became the University of Bristol's Department of Agricultural and Horticultural Research and its name was changed to Long Ashton Research Station. Indeed, the Universities of Bath and Bristol ran Master of Science (MSc) courses at the research station for many years. The first purpose built laboratory, the Barker Laboratory, was ready for use in 1914. Fenswood Farm on the north side of the road was bought by the University in 1920 to extend the space available for experiments, and in 1921 the Campden Research Station was taken under Long Ashton's management. The plant pathologists Lawrence Ogilvie and Brian Mulligan at Long Ashton Research Station 1930 The British Government formed the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in 1931 and this body was given a direct role in managing LARS. During World War II a home grown source of Vitamin C was needed and the blackcurrant drink Ribena was developed at Long Ashton. A new Biology Laboratory was completed in 1948 and in 1952, although links with Campden Research Station ended, the ARC Unit of Plant Nutrition was set up at Long Ashton. The Station's 50th year was celebrated by the publication of a book, Science and Fruit. The 1950s were a time of rapid expansion for Long Ashton with the opening of the Kearns and Hewitt Laboratories (1956) and the Wallace Laboratory, Refectory and Conference Room (1959). The first Long Ashton International Symposium was held in 1967. 1981 saw the disbandment of two of Long Ashton's major research divisions, the Pomology and Plant Breeding Division and the Food and Beverage Division. This action by the ARC was a severe blow to the Research Station and began a long period of structural change. The Hirst Laboratory was built in 1983 as part of the reorganisation process, and work on arable crops substantially replaced Long Ashton's long history of work on fruit and cider. The Wallace Laboratory at Long Ashton, following closure of the site The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC, previously ARC) closed other research sites including the Letcombe Laboratory (1985) and the Weed Research Organisation (1986) and their staff and programmes were moved to Long Ashton. With Rothamsted it became part of the Institute of Arable Crops Research (IACR) in 1986. Although the new Treharne Library and Fryer Laboratory were built in 1987, as a junior partner in IACR, Long Ashton was now vulnerable in the event of further restructuring. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC, formed from the previous AFRC in 1994) announced in 1999 that Long Ashton was to be closed. The seventeenth and final Long Ashton International Symposium took place in 2002 and the Research Station was duly closed in 2003 having served agriculture and horticulture for exactly 100 years. Some of the remaining staff were moved to Rothamsted during Long Ashton's final years, providing some continuity with the programmes of work under way prior to closure. The site was sold and subsequently redeveloped for housing, employment space, community uses and playing fields. ==Nutrient solution== Long Ashton is also commonly known for the development of the Long Ashton Nutrient Solution (LANS).Hewitt E.

Technical Communication No. 22 (Revised 2nd Edition) of the Commonwealth Bureau of Horticulture and Plantation Crops. The LANS concentrations for each element in a full solution are shown below. *N 168 ppm *K 156 ppm *Ca 160 ppm *P 41 ppm *S 48 ppm *Na 31 ppm *Mg 36 ppm *B 0.54 ppm *Fe 5.6 ppm or 2.8 ppm *Mn 0.55 ppm *Zn 0.065 ppm *Cu 0.064 ppm *Mo 0.048 ppm The Long Ashton or Hewitt solution is widely used and is considered to be suitable for supporting growth of a range of different plant species. Hewitt's and Hoagland's solution formulations led to increased growth of nursery fig trees in high-tunnel and open-field conditions, respectively. ==Long Ashton International Symposia== This series of international conferences was well respected and attended by scientists from every continent. * 1967 \u2013 Recent aspects of nitrogen metabolism in plants * 1969 \u2013 Physiology of tree crops * 1971 \u2013 Fungal pathogenicity * 1973 \u2013 Lactic acid bacteria in beverages and food * 1975 \u2013 Environmental effects on crop physiology * 1977 \u2013 Nitrogen assimilation of plants * 1979 \u2013 Quality in stored and processed vegetables and fruit * 1982 \u2013 Improving vegetatively propagated crops * 1984 \u2013 Rational pesticide use * 1986 \u2013 Hormone action in plant development \u2014 a critical appraisal * 1989 \u2013 Herbicide resistance in weeds and crops * 1991 \u2013 Transport and receptor proteins of plant membranes: molecular structure and function * 1993 \u2013 Ecology and integrated farming systems * 1995 \u2013 Plant roots \u2014 from cells to systems * 1997 \u2013 Understanding pathosystems: a focus on Septoria * 1999 \u2013 Biotechnology of cereals: tools, targets and triumphs * 2002 \u2013 New frontiers in plant development: from genes to phenotype ==Notable former staff== * John Pilkington Hudson \u2013 director, horticultural scientist * H.G.H.
