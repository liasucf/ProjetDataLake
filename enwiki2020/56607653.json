    "text": "Sail Croatia is a British cruise line operating in the Adriatic Sea along the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. It promotes an ecological initiative called Green Sail. In 2013, the line had four chartered motorised cruising vessels. Along with sailing, the offer included kayaking and rafting on the mainland and buggy safaris on the islands, as well as cycling on week-long trips in its \"sail & cycle\" holidays. Aside from leisurely cruises, the line introduced party boats for the 21-35 age group in 2017. The motor yachts, which take up to 40 passengers, are based at Split Marina. == Green Sail initiative == The Green Sail initiative educates cruise lines, sailors, and tourists about the importance of sorting and recycling waste on the Adriatic. By mid-2017, it had managed to gather 500 charter lines and partner marinas. Each vessel in the Green Sail network contains free packages for guests with information on Dalmatian marinas with recycling facilities. ==References== Category:British companies established in 2003 Category:Cruise lines Category:Travel and holiday companies of the United Kingdom Category:2003 establishments in England ",
