All figures are in US dollars. :2. As players are not paid salary in the preseason or postseason, no fines are generated for games lost due to suspension during those periods. :3. Fines generated for games lost due to suspension for off- ice conduct are calculated uniquely and irrespective of repeat offender status. :4. Suspension accompanied by mandatory referral to the NHL/NHLPA Program for Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health. :5. Watson's original suspension was for 27 games, plus the remaining 6 games of the preseason. The suspension was appealed by Watson on September 20, 2018. On October 12, 2018, NHL/NHLPA Neutral Discipline Arbitrator, Shyam Das, overruled the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's 27 regular season game suspension down to 18 regular season games. The NHL and NHLPA agreed to use Das as a neutral discipline arbitrator on an ad hoc basis as regular arbitrator George Nicolau was unavailable. :6. Suspension was appealed by Wilson on October 5, 2018. On October 25, 2018, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced he had heard the appeal and was upholding the original 20 game suspension levied to Wilson. The NHLPA then appealed to neutral arbitrator on behalf of Wilson, on October 26. On November 13, 2018, NHL/NHLPA Neutral Discipline Arbitrator, Shyam Das, overruled the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's 20 regular season game suspension down to 14 regular season games. The NHL and NHLPA agreed to use Das as a neutral discipline arbitrator on an ad hoc basis as regular arbitrator George Nicolau was unavailable. Though Wilson had already missed 16 of his originally assessed 20 games before Das' decision was made, his suspension will stand as 14 games in the NHL records and his salary was refunded for the 2 games he missed. :7. Indefinite suspension accompanied by mandatory referral to the NHL/NHLPA Program for Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health - Stage 2. Suspension completed only upon being cleared for on-ice competition by the program administrators. Watson was reinstated by the NHL/NHPLA on March 18, 2019, after 49 days and 21 games missed. As part of his reinstatement, Watson was entered into the follow-up care phase of the Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program. :8. Suspension was appealed by Voracek on March 11, 2019; Voracek applied for an expedited appeal, due to the short nature of the suspension. On March 13, 2019, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced he had heard the appeal and was upholding the original 2 game suspension levied to Voracek. As Voracek's suspension was fewer than 6 games, per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Commissioner's decision was final and binding and not subject to review, and the NHLPA was not allowed to appeal to a neutral arbitrator on Voracek's behalf. :9.Nazem Kadri was suspended for the remainder of the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs. At the time of the suspension, the number of games for the suspension could have ranged from 3 to 5 games. ==Fines== Players can be fined up to 50% of one day's salary, up to a maximum of $10,000.00 for their first offense, and $15,000.00 for any subsequent offenses (player had been fined in the 12 months prior to this fine). Coaches, non-playing personnel, and teams are not restricted to such maximums. Fines for players/coaches fined for diving/embellishment are structured uniquely and are only handed out after non-publicized warnings are given to the player/coach for their first offense.
