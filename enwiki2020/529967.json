Below is a list of some of the fictional colleges of the University of Cambridge. *All Saints College - In The Fellows (Late of Room 17); The Green Man by Kingsley Amis; mentioned briefly in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams and in Dreaming of the Bones by Deborah Crombie. *Boniface College, Cambridge - Pendennis by William Thackeray, inspired by his time at Cambridge and home to the poet Sprott. *Brakespeare College - Manalive by G. K. Chesterton. *Canterbury College - The Mezzotint by M. R. James. *Fawkes College - in the novels of Mary Selby/Joanna Bell/Mary Lowth.
