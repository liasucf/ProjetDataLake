The class was recognised by the World Sailing from 1997 to 2008 https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2018/03/05/farr-30-end-era/. ==History== The International Farr 30 One Design Class Association was formed as the owners association to support the class and promote One Design class sailboat racing amongst owners which led to the class becoming an ISAF Recognised Class. This entitles the class to hold World Championships officially recognized by World Sailing. The boat was originally named the Mumm 30 after its original title sponsor Champagne Mumm. After his sponsorship ended in 2007, the class then rebranded to Farr 30, using a modified version of the Farr 40 class logo. Both the Farr 30 and 40 had been under the management of Geoff Stagg since their inception; however, in 2009 the Farr 30 Class owners association assumed control of the class. The boat has been produced by a number of builders, with Carrol Marine USA and Ovington Boats GBR building the majority. Other builders are DK Composites and US Watercraft. ==Events== ===World Championship=== {| |- |1997 Marseille | Chris Law | | |- |1998 Hilton Head || Luca Bassani | Ed Collins Walter Geurts | Jack LeFort |- |1999 Hamble | Ed Collins Walter Geurts | | Mark Heeley |- |2000 Miami Beach | Vincenzo Onorato | Alberto Signorini | |- |2001 Cagliari | Maurizio Abba Luca Valerio | Andrea Cecchetti | Pierpaolo Cristofori |- |2002 Annapolis | Giuseppe Abba | | |- |2003 Portoferraio | Claudio Recchi | Stefano Leporati | Savino Formentini |- |2004 Toronto | Richard Perini | Fred Sherratt | Thomas Ritter |- |2005 La Trinit\u00e9 sur Mer | Pierre Loic Berthet | Fabien Henry | Louis Browne |- |2006 Miami Beach | Eric Maris | Richard Perini | |- | 2007 Porto Cervo | Luigi Amedeo Melegari |Barking Mad | Pierre Loic Berthet |- |2008 Newport | Guy Stenning |Barking Mad | Vincenzo Onorato |- |2009 | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| event cancelled |- | 2010 Hy\u00e8res | Daniel Souben | Bernard Malleret | Gabriel Jean Albert |- |2011 San Francisco |Groovederci |Barking Mad |Eight Ball |- |2012 B\u00e5stad |Groovederci | Martin Strandberg |Barking Mad |- |2013 Newport, RI |Groovederci |Barking Mad |Ramrod |- |2014 Copenhagen |Topas | Martin Strandberg | Patrick Lindblom |- |2015 Seattle http://www.cycseattle.org/results/2015_specific/farr30.html 14 Boats |Ramrod | | |} ===Tour de France \u00e0 la voile=== In addition to International Class competition, another significant event for the boat was the Tour de France \u00e0 la voile \"Sailing Tour of France\" whose organization used the Mumm/Farr 30 exclusively from 1999 to 2010.
