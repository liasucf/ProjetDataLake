    "text": "The Amazon Appstore for Android is an app store for the Android operating system operated by Amazon.com. It was opened on March 22, 2011 and was made available in nearly 200 countries. Developers are paid 70% of the list price of the app or in-app purchase. On September 28, 2011, Amazon launched the Kindle Fire tablet. The tablet, designed for media consumption in the Amazon ecosystem, relies solely on the Amazon Appstore for its marketplace, eschewing Google Play. Alongside the tablet was a new design for the Amazon Appstore, intended to better integrate with the tablet's user interface. On June 18, 2014, BlackBerry announced an official relationship with Amazon, which includes access to the Amazon Appstore in BlackBerry 10.3. ==Features== The Amazon Appstore included the \"Free App of the Day\" feature. Every day, an application, frequently a game, was offered for free. On the launch day, this game was Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free), in itself a promotional game. On The European launch day, the free app was Angry Birds (Ad-Free). The Free App of the Day feature made an exception to Amazon's payments, instead giving the developer none of the list price during the featured day. The store's \"Test Drive\" feature allowed users to try an application in their web browser by launching a virtual copy of Android in the Amazon EC2 cloud for half an hour. The Test Drive service was decommissioned in 2015, Amazon saying that the service had been in decline, partly due to many apps not supporting the feature, and the increasing prevalence of the \"free-to-play\" business model making it obsolete.Perez, Sarah. \"Amazon Shuts Down TestDrive.\" TechCrunch. TechCrunch, 17 Apr. 2015. Web. 20 July 2015. Amazon Shuts Down TestDrive In May 2013, Amazon introduced Amazon Coins as a form of payment for purchasing apps, games, and in-app purchases from the store. ==Android applications== As of October 9, 2019, the Amazon Appstore features 487,083 applications available for download. Only a few of the most popular apps available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store are also available on the Amazon Appstore. For example, the Facebook company offers Facebook, Facebook Lite, Instagram, Messenger and Messenger Kids in all stores. However, the company does not offer IGTV separately from Instagram on the Amazon Appstore, nor does it offer WhatsApp, Messenger Lite, Boomerang or Layout. ===History of app growth=== When the Amazon Appstore for Android launched in March 2011, it had about 3,800 apps. It reached 80,000 apps in June 2013 and 240,000 apps in June 2014.Amazon Appstore triples selection to 240,000 apps June 2014. In June 2015, the app store had nearly 334,000 apps.Amazon App Store for Android. Retrieved 23 June 2015. == Reception == Shortly after the Amazon Appstore launch, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) published an open letter expressing concerns that were primarily aimed at Amazon's distribution terms. The main concerns about the conditions were that Appstore terms force developers to permanently lower their AppStore prices if ever they do promotions on other stores, and that Amazon could choose to lower the price of an application while deciding to reduce the developer's share without having to ask permission. Following this address, Amazon clarified the Appstore developer agreement, but this did not assuage the IGDA's concerns, which declared that \"Amazon's terms represent a threat to game developers\". In July 2011, the Swedish developer Bithack pulled its Apparatus application from the Appstore and published an open letter explaining that the store was a \"disaster\" for indie developers. The main problems related to the very slow review process, the absence of any means to filter unsupported devices, and that Amazon changed the price of the application without consulting the developer, leading to the IGDA reiterating its warnings concerning Amazon's policy once again. == Accusation of trademark infringement by Apple == Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon for using a similar name to the Apple App Store. Amazon claimed that the term was too generic to be trademarked, and asked the judge to dismiss the suit. Apple responded to Amazon's attempted dismissal of the lawsuit by claiming that Amazon was tarnishing the trademark by using the name. A federal judge denied Apple's request for a preliminary injunction, disagreeing with Amazon's claim that the term is generic, and citing that Apple had not established \"a likelihood of confusion\" with Amazon's services to obtain an injunction. Apple changed its complaint after Amazon started advertising the Kindle Fire, now saying that Amazon is trying to confuse customers further by dropping the \"for Android\" part of \"Amazon Appstore for Android.\" In the amended complaint, Apple wrote that \"Amazon's use is also likely to lessen the goodwill associated with Apple's App Store service and Apple products designed to utilize Apple's App Store service by associating Apple's App Store service with the inferior qualities of Amazon's service.\" In January 2013, Apple's claims were rejected by a US District judge, who argued that the company presented no evidence that Amazon had \"[attempted] to mimic Apple's site or advertising\", or communicated that its service \"possesses the characteristics and qualities that the public has come to expect from the Apple APP STORE and/or Apple products.\" In July 2013, Apple dropped the case. == See also == *List of mobile software distribution platforms *Google Play *App Store (iOS) *BlackBerry World == References == ==External links== * Official website : mobile-apps * : developer * Category:Amazon (company) Category:Mobile software distribution platforms Category:Online marketplaces of the United States ",
