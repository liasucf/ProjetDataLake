The psychiatrist didn't name the prisoner or confirm if he had been referring to the Sheasby children. |- | December 1957/January 1958 || Anne Noblett || Whitwell, Hertfordshire || On the night of 30 December 1957, 17-year-old Anne Noblett alighted a bus on the corner of Lower Luton Road and Cherry Tree Lane in Wheathampstead and began the short walk home to Marshalls Heath. A month later her partially disrobed body was found 7 miles away in Rose Grove Wood near Whitwell.

A retired farmworker found her body in the Suffolk countryside four days later, and it was determined at the postmortem that her own scarf had been used to strangle her. There has never been an arrest in connection with this murder. |- |November 1961 |Mamie Stuart |Gower, Wales |On 5 November 1961, three men exploring an old lead mine near Brandy Cove on the Gower Peninsula discovered human remains. The body had been dismembered and was identified as 26-year-old Mamie Stuart who had gone missing in December 1919. Mamie's husband, George Shotton, was suspected of her murder but there wasn't enough evidence to charge him. Mamie was finally laid to rest in December 2019 after her remains had been stored in a Cardiff forensic laboratory for nearly sixty years. |- | September 1963 || George Wilson || Sneinton, Nottingham || George Wilson's wife found him dead or dying in a pool of blood close to the Fox & Grapes pub (of which he was the landlord) when she opened the door to it after hearing their dog barking and scratching at it from outside.

She had been sexually assaulted. It is believed she was killed the previous evening after leaving her aunt's house to catch a bus to be with her grandmother. Despite a reported DNA 'breakthrough' in 2006, Anne's murderer has never been identified. |- | October 1965 ||Elsie Frost || Wakefield, West Yorkshire || On 9 October 1965, the body of 14-year-old Elsie Frost was found with fatal stab wounds. A subsequent investigation turned up one suspect who was later released. After this there was no further investigation and details of the case were made exempt from a Freedom of Information request. The siblings of Elsie filed an FOI request when the original exemption date was coming to an end, only to find the exemption had been extended until 2060. The case was reopened in 2015 after a series of reports on BBC Radio 4. Convicted child murderer, Peter Pickering, a man in his late seventies was arrested in September 2016 on suspicion of murder, more than 50 years after Elsie's death. He was expected to be charged with Elsie's death but died before police could do so. |- | November 1966 || Helen Davidson || Amersham, Buckinghamshire || On 9 November 1966, 49-year-old Dr Helen Davidson, a popular GP, was battered to death in dense woodland in Hodgemoor Wood a few miles from her Amersham home.

She arrived at around 11:10pm and began the seven-minute walk to her parents' home, but never arrived. The headlights of a milk-float picked up the shape of her body lying in a pool of rainwater in a lovers' lane the following morning. On the fiftieth anniversary of Susan's murder, police confirmed they have DNA from the crime and there's a possibility the culprit could be identified - living or dead. |- | 31 March 1970 || Philip Green || Shirehampton, Bristol || 11-year-old Philip Green left his home in Sea Mills to collect golf balls on the nearby Shirehampton golf course. The following day his battered body was found in a wooded area of the course. The case remains unsolved despite one of the biggest police inquiries in the Bristol area, which was assisted by Scotland Yard. In 2010 on the 40th anniversary of his murder, Avon and Somerset Constabulary announced a new forensic investigation of the case that would use DNA profiling. |- | October 1970 || Barbara Mayo || Ault Hucknall, near Bolsover, Derbyshire || In October 1970, Barbara Mayo set off from her London home to hitchhike north. Six days later the 24-year-old's body was found in a wood by the north-bound carriageway in view of Hardwick Hall. The teacher had been raped and then strangled. Twenty years later, in 1990, detectives were able to confirm using DNA that Mayo's killer was the same man who had raped and strangled 18-year-old Jacqueline Ansell-Lamb seven months previously. |- | March 1971 || \"Fred the Head\" || Burton on Trent, Staffordshire || An off-duty policeman stumbled upon the upper half of a skull alongside the River Trent in Burton in March 1971. Further excavation at the site revealed the skull belonged to a man who had been buried in a kneeling position with his hands tied and wearing mustard- yellow socks. The only personal possession on him was his wedding ring. After months of investigation, including police forces from Interpol and Australia, the police came nowhere near to finding the man's identity. In 2017, a DNA analysis led police to believe it could be John Henry Jones from Trevor, near Wrexham in North Wales, who had gone missing in 1970. This proved to be incorrect, and neither case has been solved. It was believed the man was not local and may even have been from Eastern Europe. Although the case is included here, it has to be said that after an autopsy and expert opinion, no cause of death was ever recorded and the police filed the case as a 'suspicious death'. |- |25 April 1971 |Dorothy Leyden |Collyhurst, Manchester |Dorothy Leyden's body was found hours after she had been to a Jimmy Ruffin concert at the Golden Garter nightclub in Wythenshawe in April 1971. The 17-year-old's body was found on waste ground in Collyhurst. The teenager spent the evening of 24 April 1971 at the concert before heading into central Manchester. At about 02:30, she got out of a taxi she had shared with friends at Piccadilly Gardens bus station and it is thought she decided to walk home. Her body was found the following day behind the now demolished Spread Eagle pub. Previously, it had been thought she may have been murdered by serial killer Trevor Hardy, but this was dismissed in 2008. |- | May 1971 || Rose Lifely || Bournemouth, Dorset || Miss Rose Lifely was 73 years old when she was stabbed to death in her Northcote Road home between 15 and 17 May 1971 \u2013 the victim of a \"maniacal attack\", according to police. Police believed the killer lived in the local area, broke into her home to steal and repeatedly stabbed her when she confronted him. On 25 May, the Evening Times reported that police were hunting for a \"cuddly\" buxom 18-year-old blonde and two youths, who had gone to second-hand shops in Bournemouth attempting to sell jewellery similar to pieces missing from Lifely's home. |- | May 1971 || P Walsh || Holloway, London || P Walsh's body was discovered in his van on 22 May. He had been stabbed, and, according to detectives of the time, probably by a fellow motorist with whom he had become embroiled in an argument. |- | June 1971 || Gloria Booth || Ruislip, Middlesex || On the morning of Sunday 13 June, the naked body of Gloria Booth was discovered on a recreation ground off Nairn Road, approximately half a mile from South Ruislip Underground Station and a mile from the scene of the Jean Townsend killing 17 years earlier. Like Jean Townsend, Mrs Booth \u2013 a 29-year-old housewife from Ealing \u2013 had died from strangulation and it appeared that \u2013 as in the Townsend killing \u2013 a scarf had been used.\"Police search for clues in murder hunt\", Middlesex County Times and Gazette, 18 June 1971. |- | October 1971 || Susan Turner || Hartlepool, County Durham || Two schoolboys came across the 19-year-old newlywed's body whilst playing in a derelict house during their lunchbreak. She had been strangled. Her widower was accused of the murder at a trial that took place the following February, but the paucity of evidence against him (forensic scientists had found no trace in his house of dust from the derelict building) prompted the judge to order the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. |- | April 1972 || Maxwell Confait || Catford, London || Three youths jailed for strangling Maxwell Confait (a 26-year-old transvestite and male prostitute also known as Michelle) and starting a fire at his residence were released and pardoned three years after the killing. In 1980, a prisoner became a suspect in Mr Confait's murder when an incriminating conversation between him and a fellow inmate was overheard, but because he and the person he claimed to have been with at the time of the offence each maintained that it was the other who had committed it, neither of them could be charged with it. The case led to changes in police procedures. |- | June 1972 || Judith Roberts || Wigginton, near Tamworth, Staffordshire || The 14-year-old girl was battered to death not far from her family home in a village just north of Tamworth. A young soldier stationed at Whittington Barracks confessed to the murder and served 25 years in jail; however, he later claimed that his confession was a result of psychological problems he was experiencing at the time. With there being no other evidence against him, his conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal. The real killer remains unknown. |- | July 1972 || Pauline Riolo || Liverpool || The body of 29-year-old Pauline Riolo had three stab wounds to the chest when it was found in Mulgrave Street, in the Toxteth area of the city, on 29 July. |- | November 1972 || Amala Ruth De Vere Whelan || Maida Vale, London || On 12 November 1972, a 22-year-old woman was found dead at her home in Randolph Avenue, Maida Vale, west London.

In January 2017, police issued a fresh appeal for information. |- |December 1972 |Nora Wilfred |Cardiff |Nora Wilfred, 33, was found dead on 4 December 1972, her body was dumped on wasteland off Pugsley Lane, Herbert Street in Butetown, Cardiff. Nora had been a sex worker at the time of her death, she had been stabbed multiple times and some of her clothing, along with her handbag, was missing. |- |January 1973 |Martha Graham |Swinton, Manchester |Killed on 16 January by being battered around the head with a rolling pin. Her husband, Frank Graham, was charged with her murder but acquitted. |- |March 1973 |James Cockerell |Leeds |James Cockerell suffered a fatal stabbing on 2 March 1973. He was 66. |- |March 1973 |Mary Armstrong |Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire |31-year-old Mary Armstrong was killed in a Hanley car park on 24 March. Someone charged with the murder was found not guilty of it at the end of a 63-day trial. |- |March 1973 |Ann Law |Body not found |34-year-old Ann Law, a mother of two, went missing from her home on Copperas Lane, West Denton, Newcastle on 24 March 1973. She was in the process of divorcing her husband, Gilbert Law, but the couple still lived together. Gilbert Law was questioned about his wife's disappearance two years after her death but not charged. In 1982 he allegedly confessed to his son, son-in-law and a friend that he had buried Ann on the bank of the River Tyne near Bywell. After his arrest, Gilbert allegedly told police that Ann had drunk herself to death and, later, that he had strangled her. He then denied making any confession. He stood trial in 1983 but this was halted due to his mental state. At his next trial in June 1984 the judge ordered the jury to acquit him of murder. No one else has ever been charged in connection with Ann's disappearance or murder and her body has never been found despite extensive excavations of the riverbank in 1982. |- |May 1973 |Christine Markham |Body not found |Just after boarding a bus without her to take them to a different school, nine-year-old Christine Markham's two sisters looked out of a window and saw that she had doubled back on herself instead of continuing to walk in the direction of her own school. That evening, when she hadn't come home, a hunt for her began that would lead to around 5,000 residences being searched in the Lincolnshire town of Scunthorpe (where the girls and their parents lived), but no trace of her was found. Robert Black, a serial killer known to have murdered at least four young girls, is suspected of being responsible for Christine's disappearance. |- |June 1973 |Mary Anne Mackey |Newcastle |Found with stab wounds to the head in a lane at the rear of her house. She was aged 80 and died from the wounds in hospital. |- |September 1973 |Iris Thompson and Caroline Woodcock |Brentwood, Essex |53-year-old Iris Thompson and her mother, 79-year-old Caroline Woodcock, were murdered on 11 September by being bludgeoned and stabbed at the Shenfield address they shared with Iris's husband (who had left to go to work a short time before the killings). No sign of forced entry into their home was discovered. |- | September 1973 || Wendy Sewell || Attacked in Bakewell, Derbyshire; died in hospital in Chesterfield, Derbyshire || The 32-year-old legal secretary was savagely beaten in a churchyard on 12 September, and later died of her wounds. Church groundskeeper Stephen Downing was convicted of the murder, but the verdict was eventually overturned on appeal when he had served 27 years. The case was re-investigated by police, but no further arrests were made. |- |October 1973 |Warren and Elizabeth Wheeler |Boars Hill, Oxfordshire |Warren Wheeler, 83, and his wife, Elizabeth, 79, were found battered to death at their home, Yatscombe Cottage, in the Oxfordshire hamlet of Boars Hill in October 1973. A man stood trial in 1974 after confessing to the murders, but the judge directed that he be cleared stating that he was an attention seeker who had previously confessed to murders which he hadn't committed. |- | January 1974 || Glenis Carruthers || Clifton, Bristol ||The 20-year-old woman from Amersham in Buckinghamshire was found strangled on Clifton Down after she had left a friend's 21st birthday party on Friday 18 January at 10pm. |- | February 1974 || Rosina Hilliard || Leicester || Rosina Hilliard's body was discovered on a building site in Leicester on 22 February. She had been working as a prostitute in the city. The postmortem uncovered both evidence of compression to the neck and injuries consistent with her having been hit by a car, but precisely which injury it was that ended the life of the 24-year-old could not be ascertained. |- | April 1974 || Caroline Allen || Near Old Dalby, Leicestershire || 17-year-old Caroline vanished whilst on her way from Bramcote, Nottinghamshire to her home in Kinoulton on 10 April 1974. Her skeleton was found in rural Leicestershire in December 1975. The pathologist who examined it was unable to say for definite how she had died, but thought she might have suffered a beating to the head. |- |April 1974 |Lena Farr |Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire |Lena Farr, 77, was found dead at her home, Vine Cottage, on Brook Street, on 12 April 1974. The cause of her death was asphyxiation. |- |August 1974 |Gary Shields |Tynemouth, Tyne & Wear |Six-year-old Gary Shields was murdered when he went out to play football close to his home on 4 August 1974. His body was found in reeds on the bank of the River Tyne just two hundred yards from where he lived in Knotts Flats. A man confessed to Gary's killing and then retracted his statement, his mental state was described as unstable. He was found guilty of manslaughter through diminished responsibility but his conviction was quashed in 1976 after a second man confessed. The second confession was made by Kenneth Woodhouse in 1975 who was already serving time in jail for offences against children. Despite this, no charges were ever brought against Woodhouse. |- | August 1974 || Norfolk headless body || Cockley Cley, Norfolk || Concealed in weeds off a road in Cockley Cley, near Swaffham, the badly decomposed and headless body of a woman was found by a farm worker in August 1974. The woman was believed to have been aged between 23 and 35 and was wearing a frilled pink Marks & Spencer nightdress. Another clue was the brown plastic sheet in which she was wrapped, bearing the letters NCR (National Cash Register). Only six such sheets were made by a Scottish company between 1962 and 1968, but police have never identified the woman, let alone her killer. Today, there is no grave or headstone for her, just an unmarked spot in a Swaffham churchyard. Police have suggested that the woman could have been a sex worker based in Great Yarmouth known as 'The Duchess' who disappeared in mid-1974. In 2016, it was announced that a full DNA profile had been obtained from her remains so possible family members could be traced in a bid to determine her identity. |- | October 1974 || Josephine Backshall || Near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire || 39-year-old Mrs Backshall went missing after travelling to Witham in Essex on 29 October to meet a man regarding some work he had promised her \u2013 a man who apparently had given his name as Peter. Three days later, her body was discovered in countryside approximately 35 miles from her Maldon (also in Essex) home, and it was found during the autopsy that she had been choked but not sexually assaulted. |- | February 1975 || Ivy Davies || Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex || A steel bar was used to batter 48-year-old Ivy Davies to death in her house. In 2005, following a tip- off, police recovered from someone's loft a bloodstained carpet thought to possibly have some connection to the crime and arrested that person (a 68-year-old onetime neighbour of Ivy's) over it, but insufficient evidence meant they couldn't actually charge him with it. Another suspect is a man said to have visited Ivy's caf\u00e9 in late 1974 or early 1975 \u2013 a man purporting to be a doctor but in reality an escapee from a mental hospital, according to a woman who worked at the caf\u00e9 when Ivy was its owner. |- | 1975 || Eve Stratford, Lynne Weedon || London || Eve Stratford was found dead on 18 March 1975. The 21-year-old Bunny Girl, who worked at the Playboy Club in Park Lane, where she had been pictured with Eric Morecambe and Sid James, had her throat cut between eight and 12 times. She had also been tied up and gagged and was found by her boyfriend lying on the floor of her apartment in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, London. In 2007, police found a link between Stratford's murder and that of 16-year-old Lynne Weedon. Weedon had been beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a shortcut to her home in Hounslow six months after Stratford's death. Despite suffering horrific injuries, Weedon was alive when found the next morning, but died a week later in hospital without regaining consciousness. Both murders were featured on the BBC programme Crimewatch in September 2007, where it was said that they were sexually motivated and, thanks to new DNA techniques, were now known to have been committed by the same person. |- | July 1975 || Renee McGowan || Bradford, West Yorkshire || Renee McGowan, 55, was strangled in her flat on the top floor of a tower block on 22 or 23 July. Although drawers and cupboards in the flat were open when her fianc\u00e9 discovered her body there, nothing appeared to have been stolen from the property. Police came to suspect that the killer might belong to the Bradford Phoenix Society, a club to help divorced and separated people find new partners and to which Renee herself had belonged, and so decided to compare with the fingerprints of its members some unidentified fingerprints that had been found in the flat. No match was made, however. |- |August 1975 |Helen Bailey |Great Barr, Birmingham |Eight-year-old schoolgirl, Helen Bailey, was last seen when she left her home in Great Barr to play outside at 3.30pm on 10 August. Her body was found the following morning in woodland at Booths Farm, close to her home. Helen had cuts to her throat and the inquest found that her death could have been the result of an \"accident or practical joke gone wrong\". Helen's death was re-examined in 2014 with a pathologist stating that it was a \"clear case of homicide\". The verdict of the original inquest was overturned in 2018 and a new inquest was held in 2019 which found that Helen had been unlawfully killed. An imprisoned man reportedly confessed to Helen's murder in 1979 and is still considered to be the main suspect. He remains in prison and the Crown Prosecution Service is yet to make a decision about prosecuting him. |- | November 1975 || Margaret Lightfoot || Epping Forest, Essex ||Margaret Lightfoot's naked body was found in Epping Forest the day after she failed to return home from taking her dog for a walk. She lived nearby, and her death was due to strangulation. |- |November 1975 |Kathleen Cock |Effingham, Surrey |The killer of the 78-year-old widow murdered her in her own home by pounding her head \u2013 most likely with a hammer. A neighbour found her body there on 27 November. Apart from wedding and engagement rings, none of Mrs Cock's possessions was taken away by the person behind the killing, who is believed to have struck again in March 1976 by murdering Khantoon Teja in New Malden. |- |December 1975 |Hugh Watson |Llanrwst, Conwy |Hugh Watson, 77, was attacked after he had spent an evening at the Pen-y-Bryn Hotel on 9 December 1975. The recluse lived in a cow shed on Station Road and his body was found in a hay barn close to his home after the barn had been set alight. Hugh died from asphyxia and was stabbed with a weapon similar to a pitchfork. |- |January 1976 |Esther Soper |Plymouth, Devon |Widowed Esther Soper, a 51-year-old grandmother, was found dead in her home on Trematon Terrace, Mutley, Plymouth on New Year's Day 1976. Her body had been wrapped in her curtains after she had been bludgeoned with a cider bottle and strangled. Mrs Soper had been trying to sell her home and a mysterious 'estate agent' had called round in the days before her death. The case was reviewed in 1997 using DNA testing, but only Mrs Soper's DNA was found from the scene. |- |February 1976 |Helen Hooper |Body not found |31 years old and living in the Hertfordshire village of Standon, Helen Hooper disappeared on 13 February after informing her husband that she was moving out because she didn't want to be with him anymore. (She was already seeing another man.) He was subsequently arrested and charged with her murder, but the case was thrown out at the magistrates' court, despite small amounts of blood having been found on a knife and on shoes in the house they had shared. |- |February 1976 |Maureen Mulcahy |Port Talbot, Wales |Maureen Mulcahy, 22, was last seen at the Green Meadow pub in Aberavon on the night of 23 February 1976. A dog walker found her body the following morning on waste ground close by, she had been strangled. There's speculation that Maureen may have been murdered by a serial killer, the 'Saturday Night Strangler', who was posthumously identified as Joe Kappen in 2002. DNA evidence revealed that Joe Kappen murdered three teenagers in the area in 1973: Sandra Newton, Geraldine Hughes and Pauline Floyd. Detectives believe Maureen could have been a fourth victim but no conclusive evidence has been found. |- |March 1976 |Jack Wood |Pangbourne, Berkshire |Bookmaker Jack Wood, 73, was murdered during a robbery at his betting shop and home on 3 March 1976. He was bound, gagged, then bludgeoned. |- | July 1976 || Joan Maschek || Nottingham || 48-year-old Joan Maschek was beaten to death in her bedsit with an object that either was flat or had one or more flat parts \u2013 possibly her own guitar, which was damaged and had traces of her blood on it. It is not known whether the murder was premeditated or the result of a disagreement escalating rapidly into something deadly. |- | July 1976 || Margaret Armishaw || Liverpool || On 30 July 1976, police were informed that the body of a woman had been discovered in Ritson Street, Toxteth. The deceased was Margaret Ann Armishaw, a 28-year-old also known as Peggy Stretch, and the postmortem found strangulation to have been the cause of her death. |- | August 1976 || Susan Donoghue || Bristol || The 44-year-old night nurse was battered with a truncheon and sexually assaulted in her ground-floor flat in the Sneyd Park area. Signs of ransacking were apparent in the flat, although whether anything was actually taken from there has not been disclosed to the public. It has been disclosed, however, that the killer left items he'd come with at the scene of the crime, and these included a tobacco tin, a pair of gloves and the murder weapon itself. Forensic examinations of them did not point towards a suspect. Nevertheless, because the killer's semen was also recovered from the scene, advances in technology meant that people working on the case had a full DNA profile of him by the 40th anniversary of the murder. |- | November 1976 || Renee and Andrew MacRae || Bodies not found || Described as one of the most baffling mysteries in Scottish criminal history, the double murder of Renee MacRae and her three-year-old son, Andrew, shocked and scandalised the Highlands, and mesmerised the small, tight-knit community of Inverness.Miller, Russell. \"Searching high and low\", The Times. 8 May 2005. MacRae had planned to spend the weekend in Perthshire with her lover, a married man who was also Andrew's father. On the evening of Friday 12 November 1976, MacRae left Inverness and headed south on the A9. At ten o'clock that evening, a train driver reported a car ablaze on a lay-by adjacent to the A9 trunk road at Dalmagarry. The bodies of the two victims have never been found, though traces of blood matching Renee and Andrew's blood type were discovered in the boot of the burnt-out car. Attention focused on nearby Dalmagarry Quarry, where a senior member of the police believed they were buried. A 2004 excavation of the area found nothing of interest; however, a local farmer has opined that the bodies could be buried under the A9, which was in the middle of a major upgrading programme at the time of their disappearance. The farmer called for the road to be excavated at the spot where a radar survey he had commissioned found \"anomalies\".Roass, David. \"Dig up past plea to solve 34-year mystery of Renee MacRae's death\". Herald Scotland. 15 February 2010 Despite the fact that neither's body has been located, a 77-year-old man has recently been charged with murdering the MacRaes, and it is expected that he will be tried at the High Court sometime in 2020. |- | March 1977 || Barbara Ann Young || Doncaster, South Yorkshire || The 29-year-old sex worker and mother of two was severely beaten in an alleyway on 22 March and died some hours later of a brain haemorrhage caused by the beating. |- | April 1977 || Debra Schlesinger || Leeds || Debra Schlesinger, 18, was stabbed in the heart outside her home after a night out with friends. West Yorkshire Police are not revealing whether they suspect that \"Yorkshire Ripper\" Peter Sutcliffe was her killer. |- | June 1977 || Joy Sweatman || Coulsdon, London || Joy Sweatman, a 25-year-old mother of two young children, died at her suburban home when someone beat her with a hammer. Celebrations to mark the Queen's Silver Jubilee were in full swing at the time, and a train with the Queen on board passed within 150 yards of the house that day before Joy's body was discovered there early in the afternoon. Joy's two-year-old daughter was also attacked, but survived, despite being unconscious in hospital for four days. A witness saw a man outside the house wipe a hammer on his coat \u2013 a man who then left in a white Austin Maxi saloon. He was never traced. Lack of forced entry into the house caused police to deduce that Joy probably knew her killer. |- | September 1977 || Elizabeth Parravicini || Isleworth, London || The 27-year- old was only yards from her parents' house when a still-unidentified person killed her by hitting her head with a hard object. The route taken by Elizabeth to get to the house that day was said to have been uncharacteristic of her. Her death is one of more than several that have been informally linked to Peter Sutcliffe. |- |October 1977 |Brenda Evans |Poulton, Cheshire |Brenda Evans, 17, was murdered on 7 October 1977 while on her lunch break from Poulton post office and general stores. She had walked to her aunt and uncle's house to have lunch and failed to return to work. Brenda's body was found down a manhole; she had been strangled with her own tights. Her fianc\u00e9, who had been working close by cutting hedges that day, was questioned and released on bail. |- |October 1977 |Carol Wilkinson |Bradford, West Yorkshire |Carol Wilkinson, 22, was attacked on her way to her job at a bakery on Bradford's Ravenscliffe estate on 10 October 1977. She was battered with two heavy stones and her clothing was removed. She died three days later at Bradford Royal Infirmary. Anthony Steel spent 20 years in prison for Carol's murder and had his sentence quashed at the Court of Appeal in February 2003. Carol's murder remains unsolved. |- | January 1978 || Marie Lister || Kegworth, Leicestershire || The 89-year-old's body was found in her living room on 11 January. Her skull had been fractured, and police believe that an axe that was beside her corpse at the time of its discovery was what had been used to kill her. |- | 13 January 1978 || Beryl Culverwell || Bath, Somerset || 52-year-old welfare worker Beryl Culverwell was found dead in the garage of her home in Widcombe Hill, Bath. She had been stabbed 21 times and then bludgeoned to death with a shotgun. Her body was tied with twine, although there were no signs of a violent struggle. The telephone wires in the house were cut. A motive for Mrs Culverwell's murder has never been clearly determined.BBC Crimewatch, episode #3, dated 16 August 1984. |- | March 1978 || John Connors || Neath, South Wales || John Connors' home help discovered his battered body in his house on 31 March. No evidence was found that his killer had forced their way in. A brown-haired man in his 30s and around 6 ft tall was spotted coming out of the house and then driving away in a white car the day before the discovery. |- | 4 June 1978 || Michael Page|| Orpington, Kent || Eighteen- year-old Michael Page was stabbed to death as he walked home. Michael, a clerk at Natwest bank in the Elephant and Castle, had been at a party with friends in Crofton Hall, Orpington. His body was spotted lying on the pavement just a few hundred yards from his home in Avalon Road by a passing motorist at around 3.42am. Newspaper reports stated he had suffered six deep stab wounds. His plastic wallet containing his driving licence, a \u00a350 cheque card and a railway season ticket was missing, along with less than \u00a33 in change. |- | July 1978 || Brenda Page || Allan Street, Aberdeen || Dr Page's body was discovered in her flat on 14 July 1978. She had worked in the genetics department of Aberdeen University. In March 2020 a man aged 79 was arrested over her murder. |- |August 1978 |Genette Tate |Body not found |Although Genette Tate has never been found, Devon and Cornwall Police are treating her disappearance as murder. 13-year-old Genette disappeared while delivering newspapers in Aylesbeare, Devon, on 19 August 1978. Serial killer Robert Black was considered as the main suspect but evidence to support this wasn't sufficient enough to charge him with Genette's murder before his death in prison in 2016. |- | 7 September 1978 || Georgi Markov || London || Agents of the Bulgarian secret police, Darzhavna Sigurnost, assisted by the KGB had previously made two failed attempts to kill Markov before a third attempt succeeded. On 7 September 1978, Markov walked across Waterloo Bridge spanning the River Thames, and was waiting at a bus stop on the other side, when he was jabbed in the calf by a man holding an umbrella. The man apologized and walked away. Markov would later tell doctors that the man had spoken with a foreign accent. The event is recalled as the \"Umbrella Murder\" with the assassin claimed to be Francesco Gullino, codenamed \"Piccadilly\". |- | 19 September 1978 || Carl Bridgewater || Yew Tree Farm, Kinver, Staffordshire || 13-year-old Carl Bridgewater was shot in the head at close range when he disturbed burglars while delivering a newspaper to a house on 19 September 1978. The Bridgewater Four were originally convicted in 1979, but were acquitted in 1997. |- | 12 October 1978 || Margaret Frame || Brighton, East Sussex || The body of 34-year-old mother of one, Margaret Frame, was found buried in a shallow grave in woods on the northern outskirts of Brighton ten days after she disappeared on 12 October 1978. She had been raped, stabbed in the back and had her throat slit. No-one has ever been charged with her murder. |- |November 1978 |Gary Wilson |Deptford, London |The body of 14-year-old Gary Wilson was found in the yard of a derelict shop in Deptford in November 1978. Gary had been stabbed and strangled. A man was jailed for his murder the following year but was released from prison in 1995 after his conviction was found to be unsafe. |- | December 1978 || Walter Taylor || Ashby, North Lincolnshire || Taylor, 17, was found dead shortly before Christmas on the Jubilee Playing Fields in Ashby. He had been attacked with a piece of wood. |- | January 1979 || Lynda Farrow || Whitehall Road, Woodford Green, London || On 19 January 1979, heavily pregnant mother of two Lynda Farrow was found brutally murdered in her home in Whitehall Road. Her throat had been slashed and she had been raped. Earlier that day, Farrow had been shopping with her mother, and had bought a new pair of shoes and a coat. She then went to her partner's fruit stall before returning home by car. It is believed that Farrow either ran into her home to answer her ringing phone, leaving the door open behind her, or that she knew her attacker and let him in willingly. Farrow's body was found by her two daughters. In 2010, Farrow's killing was reconstructed on BBC's Crimewatch. The appeal featured her partner, now remarried, and her two daughters. The only sighting of Farrow's killer was by her neighbour, who saw a man wearing a long black coat entering Farrow's home at around 2pm. He had blonde hair and blue eyes. The only other clue to the killer is a set of footprints leading to Farrow's house. So far, nobody has been convicted for her murder. |- | February 1979 || Sultan Mahmood || Bradford, West Yorkshire || Sultan Mahmood was a 31-year-old taxi driver and it was believed by the police that he was killed by members of a van-smuggling gang so they could resell his van in Pakistan. In 1983, a man already in jail for a different crime was put on trial for Mr Mahmood's murder, but the trial collapsed when it was revealed that the two fellow prisoners whom he supposedly admitted to being the killer to had good reason to believe they would benefit from testifying against him. (Ahead of the hearing, one of the two men was told his charges would be wiped if he did so, the other that he would be given bail.) The case was reopened when the police received fresh information about it in 1994, but no breakthrough came from this new lead. |- | February 1979 || Joe Gallagher and Frieda Hunter || Hyde, Greater Manchester || Joe Gallagher and Frieda Hunter were a young couple bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of their home on Hallbottom Street. The pair were last seen after 20-year-old Frieda was picked up from her Saturday evening shift as a barmaid at a local pub (The Queens in Hyde town centre) by Joe, her 30-year-old boyfriend, four days before their bodies were found. Joe was known to both use cannabis (apparently for medicinal reasons, due to a minor facial disfigurement) and deal in the drug, and had told family members that he had received threats, though no definitive motive for them or for the killings has been established. The killer or killers had broken into the house through the kitchen window, and the bodies of the pair were found when Joe (a taxi driver) had failed to turn up for work. His pay-packet from work appeared to have been stolen, and the couple had been battered to death with a blunt instrument while in bed together, suggesting a late night or early morning break-in. |- |March 1979 |Resham Kaur Dhillon |Willenhall, West Midlands |Resham Kaur Dhillon was found strangled in her bedroom at her home on Fisher Street, Willenhall on 5 March 1979. Although the motive for Resham's murder wasn't clear, it was believed that cash and gold were stolen. Anonymous letters after Resham's death suggested a lead but the case remains unsolved. |- | March 1979 || Carol Lannen || Dundee || Part- time sex worker Carol Lannen, 18, was seen getting into a man's red car near Dundee city centre sometime after nightfall on 20 March 1979. Her naked body was discovered in Templeton Woods the next day, and the cause of death was asphyxiation. Similarities between the cases have led to speculation that this murder is linked to that of Elizabeth McCabe in 1980. |- | 17 April 1979 || Gordon Snowden || Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire || At around 2am the day after Easter Monday, Gordon Snowden, 60, a petrol pump attendant at Sutton Bridge Motors, located on Bridge Road near Crosskeys Bridge, was found lying beside his kiosk with severe head injuries. A cash till had been stolen. Snowden later died in hospital from his injuries. Part of the investigation centred on trying to trace a Citro\u00ebn 2CV seen on the garage forecourt shortly before the murder. The cold case remains one of Lincolnshire Police's few unsolved murders. In the late 1990s, British serial contract killer John \"Bruce\" Childs from East London, convicted of six killings in the 1970s, confessed to five more murders from his jail cell, claiming that the fifth victim was Snowden. Childs said he killed Snowden with a cosh because he was afraid he would be recognised after dumping another murder victim's car in the nearby River Nene. Childs claimed that six months earlier, he and associate Henry (Harry) \"Big H\" Mackenney had called at the filling station after murdering Ronald Andrews and dumping his car in the River Nene. Fearing that Snowden would remember the two strangers after the car was recovered, Childs went back to secure his silence. He said: \"I battered him to death with a cosh in his office and took the till to make it look like robbery. He was an old boy, and when I look back I'm sorry. But in those days I was ruthless about eliminating risks. It may sound silly, but I'm telling this now because I think that man might have relatives and I would like them to know the truth.\" However, Lincolnshire Police have confirmed that nobody has ever been charged or prosecuted in relation to the murder. |- |April 1979 |Blair Peach |Southall, London |Blair Peach, a special needs teacher, was involved in a mass demonstration against a National Front meeting in Southall on 23 April 1979. When police charged at protestors, Blair was struck on the head and died from his injuries. A report made public in 2010 concluded that Blair was 'almost certainly' killed by a riot police officer, in the same year the Scotland Yard commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, apologised to Blair's family. |- |July 1979 |Eddie Cotogno |Dumbarton |63-year-old \"Wee Eddie\" Cotogno was the victim of a fatal hammer attack in his flat. A policeman on duty had his attention drawn to the flat by a fire there \u2013 a fire presumed to have been started by the murderer in order to get rid of forensic evidence. Because Angus Sinclair, who would eventually be exposed as a serial killer, had recently fallen out with Cotogno and was known by the police to have killed a seven-year-old girl when he was 16, it wasn't long before detectives were questioning him about the murder of the pornographer. Backed up by his wife, Sinclair gave them an alibi that they found satisfactory, but years later she claimed that he hadn't been with her at the time of Cotogno's death after all. |- |August 1979 |Wendy Jenkins |Bristol |The last time the 32-year-old sex worker was seen alive, she was talking to a smartly dressed man at the junction of Drummond Road and City Road at daybreak or thereabouts on 27 August (a Bank Holiday Monday). A labourer found her mutilated body on a building site about 27 hours after that sighting. The Yorkshire Ripper was officially a suspect in the early stages of the police investigation into Wendy Jenkins' murder. |- | September 1979 || Alison Morris || Ramsey, Essex || The 25-year-old postgraduate of London's Royal Holloway College was stabbed repeatedly in the chest. Her body was found in a country lane by her father, who had gone out to search for her because she hadn't returned home after leaving to go for a walk in the woods. |- | October 1979 || John (a.k.a. Jack) Armstrong || Stalling Down, near Cowbridge, South Wales || On 5 October 1979, John Armstrong set off in his taxi to pick up someone calling himself Williams and asking to be taken from Fairwater to Cowbridge. Mr Armstrong's body was found three days later, 11 miles from where the taxi had been found abandoned at 6pm on the day of that journey. He had been beaten around the head. |- | October 1979 || Bedgebury Forest Woman || Bedgebury Forest, Kent || On 23 October 1979, a mystery woman aged between 30 and 35 was found in Bedgebury Forest, having been beaten to death. The discovery led to a murder enquiry but she was never identified. It was thought she had come from Eastern Europe and had one child. She was white, about 5 ft 1 in tall, and of thin build, with brown eyes and dark brown shoulder-length straight hair. When found, she was wearing black shoes, a floral dress and a black polo neck jumper. Police re-investigated the case in 1999, and in May 2000 Harry Pennells from East Sussex stood trial for her murder but was acquitted after a four-week trial. |- | December 1979 || Sally Shepherd || Peckham, London || The 24-year-old restaurant manager from Peckham was clubbed, stamped on and sexually assaulted shortly after stepping off a bus during the early hours of 1 December. Three hair strands found near her body are likely to be from the person who took her life, but forensic scientists are refraining from testing them until technology has advanced enough to make the chances of obtaining a full DNA profile from them more promising. |} == 1980s == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=5%| Year ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Name of victim(s) ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Location body found ! style=\"width:60%;\"| Notes |- | February 1980 || Elizabeth McCabe || Dundee || Elizabeth McCabe, a trainee nursery nurse aged 20, was strangled after parting company with a friend and leaving a nightclub. The killer dumped her naked body in Templeton Woods. In 2007, a former taxi driver stood in court accused of the crime, but he was found not guilty at the conclusion of the trial. Similarities between the cases have led to speculation that this murder is linked to that of Carol Lannen in 1979. |- | April 1980 || Lillian Wright || Body not found || Lillian Wright disappeared from Lowestoft in Suffolk when she was 55, having last been seen in the town's Lovewell Road. Police were treating her disappearance as a no-body homicide by 2004. |- | May 1980 || Jessie Earl || Beachy Head, East Sussex || Aged 22; disappeared from Eastbourne around 15 May 1980. Her skeletal remains were found almost nine years later, in April 1989, in bushes at nearby Beachy Head. British serial killer Peter Tobin became (and remains) an official suspect in Earl's murder, as he lived in Eastbourne in the early 1980s. Police later commented, however, that they \"cannot prove anything unless Tobin confesses\". |- |June 1980 |Patricia \"Patsy\" Morris |Hounslow Heath, London |Choked to death with a ligature at the age of 14. Serial killers Peter Tobin and Levi Bellfield \u2013 the latter of whom did not live very far from the victim when she was killed \u2013 have both been suspects in her murder even though Bellfield was only 12 at the time. |- |August 1980 |John Greenwood and Gary Miller |Whiston, Merseyside |John Greenwood and Gary Miller were both eleven years old when they were found beaten and hidden on a disused quarry in Whiston. A dog walker found the injured boys at 7.20pm at a site which is now Stadt Moers Park on 16 August 1980. Both boys died in hospital from head injuries. A man was acquitted of their murder the following year and new leads led to the case being reopened in 2016. In 2019, Merseyside's chief constable said there was insufficient evidence for a new investigation and apologised to John and Gary's families for the original investigation not being as thorough as it could have been. |- |November 1980 |Derek Grain |Bristol |The 39-year-old was murdered by having his head struck repeatedly with a sand-filled traffic cone and being kicked. A nurse walking to work discovered his body close to Berkeley Square. Police believed it was possible that there was more than one attacker, and very likely that the motive was robbery, in view of money being missing from his jacket pocket. Though its owner was traced and had not been in or even near the city at the time, a red Jaguar seen in central Bristol by no fewer than two people that night turned out to have been registered in the Hertfordshire town of Hitchin, where Derek moved to Bristol from two months before his death. |- |December 1980 |Eric Carver |Nottingham |A man jailed in 1982 for killing Eric Carver had his conviction quashed in 2006 because appeal judges ruled that lack of evidence against him together with heavy-handed tactics used by the police to get him to confess to the crime meant that his conviction was unsafe. 64-year-old Carver was bludgeoned to death at his Lenton home while he was asleep. |- |April 1981 |Caroline Harris-Reed |Stockwell, London |Student-teacher Caroline Harris-Reed was murdered in the flat she was sharing with a 22-year-old nurse. Police issued an artist's impression of the man who forced his way into the property before holding the two young women at knifepoint and stabbing one of them to death. |- |July 1981 |Vishal Mehrotra |Rogate, West Sussex |Eight- year-old Vishal Mehrotra was last seen by his family on 29 July 1981 on a crowded street near his home in Putney, south west London. His remains were found in February 1982 fifty miles away at Durleigh Marsh Farm, Rogate, West Sussex. Vishal's father, Vishambra Mehrotra, said he was called by a man who told him that his son's disappearance was connected to a paedophile ring which frequented Elm House guest house in Barnes. |- |August 1981 |Carol Morgan |Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire |36-year-old Carol Morgan, mother of two, was attacked at a shop she ran with her husband in Linslade, near Leighton Buzzard, on 13 August 1981. She had been struck with a sharp and heavy weapon and her body was found in the storeroom.

She had gone missing around six weeks before the discovery of her body.Brownlow, Nick (2005). \"Fortean Traveller: Clapham Wood\". Fortean Times. |- |November 1981 |Pamela Hastie |Johnstone, Renfrewshire |Pamela Hastie, 16, went missing on her way home from school in November 1981. Her body was found in Rannoch Woods close to her home. Teenager Raymond Gilmour confessed to Pamela's murder and was jailed, but he maintained that he was coerced into confessing. In 2007, the verdict of his trial was ruled unsafe and Raymond was released after spending twenty years in prison. It's been suggested that Pamela could have been a victim of serial killers Peter Tobin or Robert Black. Fifteen months after Pamela's murder, 11-year-old Tracey Waters was murdered in the same town. |- |November 1981 |Dolphus Smith, Sidney Hickling and Susan Ovens |Rushden, Northamptonshire |Travellers Dolphus Smith, 57, Sidney Hickling, 27, and Susan Ovens, also 27, were shot to death in their caravans along Ditchford Lane, a road on the outskirts of Rushden, on 24 November 1981. |- |January 1982 |John McIntosh |Gullane, East Lothian |John McIntosh's body was found in his home on 26 January. The 71-year-old pensioner's killer had not left the property with anything stolen from there after beating him to death. |- |February 1982 |Sarah Hill |Lees, Greater Manchester |An intruder murdered Sarah Hill, 86, at her home on Thomas Street, Lees, on 12 February. Sarah had lived in the area all her life and worked in the nearby cotton mills. She was 4 ft 10 ins tall and frail at the time of her death, relying on neighbours to run errands for her.

Her partially clothed body was found six miles from Buxton two days later close to High Edge Raceway at Axe Edge. Elaine had died from compression to the neck. |- | June 1982 || Roberto Calvi || Blackfriars Bridge, London || The Italian banker and chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in one of modern Italy's biggest political scandals, was found hanged. The death was ruled as murder after two coroners' inquests and an independent investigation. In June 2007, five people were acquitted of his murder after a trial in Rome. See also In God's Name, a book by David Yallop which relates Calvi's murder, and the 'suiciding' of his secretary, to corruption and possibly the death of Pope John Paul I: Papa Albini. |- | July 1982 || Dora Pratt || Ipswich, Suffolk || The shopkeeper aged 76 was struck on the head three times at her Bulstrode Road premises on 9 January 1982, but didn't succumb to her injuries until 6 July. Items having been stolen from the shop at around the time the attack took place suggests robbery was the motive for it. |- |July 1982 |Tervina Cameron |Sheffield |59-year-old Tervina Cameron was found after a house fire in Addy Street, Sheffield, on 8 July 1982. A post-mortem revealed that she had died of strangulation. |- | 14 August 1982 || Gurcharn Singh Landa (known as 'John') || Cyprus Road, Mapperley, Nottingham || The 33-year-old Nottingham taxi driver was found dead in the early hours of Saturday 14 August 1982, having been stabbed 87 times. The police believe he was robbed of his takings and then stabbed, mostly in the chest. 11 people were arrested but no one charged. The father of eight was sent to Peel Street at about 4am to pick up a passenger called 'Shelton,' who had rung from a phone box. Police believe he picked someone up before driving to Cyprus Road, about a mile away. At 4:05am, a woman living on Cyprus Road heard a car brake suddenly and looking out of the window, saw the taxi rocking violently as though a fight was taking place. She also reported seeing a man searching the taxi's dashboard. She called the police then went to help but Mr Landa died shortly after police arrived. The police re-opened the case in August 2012. |- |November 1982 |Andrew Stevens |Leicester |The 20-year-old from Ratby was laid into outside a nightclub in Leicester city centre by two men who police believed may have been football fans. He was treated at Leicester Royal Infirmary for cuts to his face and then told that he could leave, but was taken back there after falling unconscious on 1 November (the day following the attack). He spent a week in a coma before dying in the hospital. |- |December 1982 |Esme Anne Hoad |Tonbridge, Kent |Esme Hoad was 85 and was killed in her Havelock Road house with a sharp instrument.

He was shot in the head and stomach (his pit bull terrier was left unharmed). Despite the flat's thin walls, the sound of gunshots didn't attract neighbours' attention \u2013 reportedly due to a fireworks display outside the building at that time. According to detectives, the murder bore all the hallmarks of an execution. The victim's body was discovered two days later by his father after he failed to turn up for work at the family's wastepaper business. A theoretical motive behind the killing had to do with the victim's sideline dealings with second-hand cars. However, such hypothesis was strongly disputed by his father. Another hypothesis is that the perpetrators were looking for something important to them (the flat was searched thoroughly). |- | 17 November 1983 || Stephen Sylvester || Car park at London's Heathrow Airport || In the early hours of 17 November 1983, the 39-year-old West Indian minicab driver was stabbed multiple times with a commando knife, while on duty. He was attacked in the car's back seat, where he had got in circumstances that remain unclear, and one of the stab wounds penetrated his heart.

Also, the killer was not able to open the car's boot. It is likely that Sangha's killer is also responsible for the murder of another taxi driver from the same area, Stephen Sylvester. |- | 17 April 1984 || WPC Yvonne Fletcher || Shot outside the Libyan Embassy in London; died in the city's Westminster Hospital || WPC Yvonne Fletcher was patrolling the area just outside the Libyan embassy during a protest when shots were fired into the crowd killing her, and injuring 10 others.

Her body was discovered just before midnight in Rugby Road, Leigh, 200 yards from the family home. Her mother, Christine, reported her missing when she failed to return home, but within a very short space of time, she received a call from the police to make her way to Leigh Infirmary and identify her daughter's body. Hession's clothing had been disturbed (suggesting a sexual motive), and she also had marks around her neck and a black eye. The case went cold, but advances in DNA technology allowed the swabbing of men in the Leigh and Wigan area to take place in 2011. However, nobody has been charged with the murder. Hession's mother died in 2016. |- | 9 December 1984 || Peter Miller || Great Yarmouth, Norfolk || The 24-year-old was found stabbed in his kitchen by his brother.

Police now have the DNA profile of a person who could be the culprit and believe it may belong to someone living in one of a number of nearby villages, but have been unable to obtain enough evidence to charge any suspect. |- |April/May 1988 |Abdur Rashid |Epping Forest, Essex |Abdur Rashid's killer murdered him by battering his head, after which they poured petrol over his body and set it alight in Epping Forest. Though no motive for the murder is known, the idea that the victim might have been targeted because of his religion (he'd formerly been a mullah at the East London Mosque) cannot be discounted. |- |May 1988 |Joan Macan |Ashridge, near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire |Bludgeoned to death on her 81st birthday after disturbing burglars at her cottage. A 47-year-old man appeared before magistrates in 1994 to stand accused of her murder, but he was never found guilty of it and the crime remains unsolved. |- |June 1988 |Joseph Hargreaves |Leeds |71-year-old Joseph Hargreaves was beaten to death without the use of a weapon. Although somebody was charged with his murder, no conviction resulted from it. |- |17 June 1988 |Sheila Farrow |Stockport, Greater Manchester |Someone brutally killed 49-year-old Sheila Farrow in Stockport town centre on 17 June. A witness saw her talking to a man in the early hours of the day she was murdered. He was described as being white, about 25, of slim build and with spiky brown hair. He was wearing a silvery, shiny suit and an open neck white shirt. Police released an e-fit of him in July 1988.

Leaving her 13-month- old son and 11-year-old sister in the car, Wilks walked approximately 700 yards along the hard shoulder to use the emergency telephone to call for help. At some point during the call, Wilks was abducted. She was found dead two days later, three miles from the location of the emergency phone (which had been found hanging down by its cord). Wilks had been stabbed in the neck. An artist's impression of the suspect resulted in the arrest and subsequent trial of soldier Eddie Browning, who spent five-and-a-half years in prison after being convicted of the murder in November 1989. He was ultimately released in May 1994 after the court of appeal ruled the conviction unsafe due to crucial evidence being withheld by the police. Browning received a \u00a3600,000 pay-out for wrongful imprisonment. In May 2018, Browning died aged 63. Reviews of the case have failed to uncover any other potential evidence or suspects. |- |27 June 1988 |Kenneth Challenger (a.k.a. Kenny Roberts) and Richard Duddie |Kingston upon Thames, London |Kenneth Challenger and Richard Duddie died in a fire at the house they and other vagrants were using as a squat. An expert who examined the house afterwards concluded that three separate fires had been started there deliberately, merging into one as they spread. A woman in her 50s was jailed for murdering the two men but the Court of Appeal quashed her conviction ten years later, in 1999. The men had been sharing the squat with her at the time of the blaze. |- |August 1988 |Percy Francis |Rushden, Northamptonshire |Because nothing suggested that entry to his bungalow had been gained illegally, 70-year-old Percy Francis likely let in willingly the person who was to kill him. His battered and stabbed body was found there on 2 August \u2013 the day after someone probably known to him had attacked him with fatal consequences. The perpetrator appeared not to have stolen anything from there. |- |August 1988 |Michael Williams |Highgate, London |Other than his murderer, the last person known to have seen Michael Williams alive was a colleague he was with on the London Underground late at night on Friday 26 August. A dog walker found his body on a path next to Highgate Wood early the following morning, and possessions he had on him on the night of 26 August (including his watch and wallet) were now missing, it was soon discovered. The pathologist tasked with determining the cause of the civil servant's death gave it as a blow to the throat, noting too that the blow was probably inflicted by a karate chop. Williams was a 42-year-old married bisexual, and police could not rule out that the attack on him was motivated by homophobia. |- | September 1988 || Lee Boxell || Body not found || Lee Boxell was last seen on the High Street in Sutton, south London in September 1988. In 2014 several men were arrested for his murder. The police believe the 15-year-old might have been killed after witnessing a sexual assault on another person at an informal youth club. |- | September 1988 || David Short || Broadstairs, Kent || After blinding him by spraying an incapacitant into his eyes as he stood at his doorstep, the 36-year-old's attacker murdered him with an unknown hard instrument by striking his head.

A few days after Laurence's disappearance, a man sold his car to a scrap dealer in Oldham. This man has never been traced. |- | October 1988 || Linda Donaldson ||Lowton, Greater Manchester || 31-year-old Linda Suzanne Donaldson was from Liverpool. Her body was found in a ditch on Winwick Lane, Lowton, near Leigh, on 18 October 1988. Linda had been stabbed and her body mutilated then washed after death - she had been murdered elsewhere and her clothing was missing. Linda was a sex worker and in 2018 police stated they would be interviewing new people about her death. It's been suggested that Linda's murder could be connected to the murders of Julie Finley and Maria Christina Requena. |- | November 1988 || Harry Howell || Blackpool, Lancashire || Harry Howell, a 74-year-old former mechanic, was last seen alive outside his home at Ibbison Court, off Central Drive, Blackpool, on 5 November 1988. His body was found by his window cleaner seventeen days later, slumped in his chair in his living room. Harry had been bludgeoned with a heavy weapon and police believed he died on the night he was last seen. The motive for his murder is believed to have been robbery: Thousands of pounds in cash and a gold watch were stolen, and Harry had let slip in his local pub that he kept his life savings at home. His murder was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch the following year. |- | 21 December 1988 || Lockerbie bombing || Bodies of victims found at various spots around Tundergarth, near Lockerbie || On 21 December 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 from Heathrow to New York exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. In January 2001, Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years. However, no-one else has been brought to court, leaving the case open. In August 2009, Megrahi was released from prison on compassionate grounds and returned to Libya due to advanced prostate cancer, from which he died in 2012. Some relatives of the dead welcomed the decision to release Megrahi, as they were convinced that he was wrongly convicted of the mass murder.Gall, Charlie. \"Lockerbie: Megrahi's release means truth of who was behind bombing may never be known\". Daily Record. 21 August 2009 |- | January 1989 || Michael Fahey || Bristol || The homeless 33-year-old was beaten to death with a blunt instrument and his body was then left at the corner of Ashley Road and Picton Street. Overnight heavy rain meant that when local police became aware that they had a new homicide on their hands up to 11 and a half hours later, anything at the scene that might have been useful as forensic evidence had they known about the crime earlier, either had been washed away or was too contaminated to have much forensic value now. Prior to the police being informed that a body lay at that spot, numerous people had passed it but simply assumed it was a sleeping vagrant, with one man who wasn't traced perhaps even capturing it on film when taking a photograph there. Whether Michael Fahey had died there or somewhere else wasn't determinable. |- | February 1989 || Jeanette Kempton || Wangford, Suffolk || 32-year-old Jeanette Kempton was last seen at The Loughborough Hotel in Brixton, south London at 7.15pm on 2 February. She lived in Brixton with her family and had no connection to the area in Suffolk where her body was found on the Earl of Stradbroke's estate, Wangford, just off the A12 on 18 February. Her coat, one shoe, purse, some jewellery and a wreath she had bought for a funeral were missing. Jeanette had been strangled.

Mr Hassard had been drinking in the nearby Lochaber Bar between about 8pm on Friday, 17 February and 1am on Saturday. Despite a lengthy police inquiry, no- one has ever been caught. In 2010, the Northern Constabulary said they were conducting a review into the case in the hope that some new evidence would come to light and ultimately resolve it. |- | March 1989 || Cyril Davies || Swansea || A person charged with murdering the 48-year-old in his own home by beating him to death was acquitted. |- | June 1989 || Tina Bell || Billingham, County Durham || Aged 18, Tina Bell went missing soon after leaving a flat above a Billingham fruit shop in early June. Not until over ten months later, when her skull, collarbone and shoulder blade were found on wasteland near ICI's Cassel Works in the town, was it confirmed that she had been murdered. Tests done on the remains indicated that the killer had tried to dissolve them in a chemical of some sort. |- |July 1989 |Martin Broom |Boreham, near Chelmsford, Essex |Martin Broom, 29, was fatally beaten at his home in Sussex Close, Boreham, on 22 July 1989. Bloodied weapons were found at the scene and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Essex Police made a new appeal for information in August 2019. |- | October 1989 || Ricky Haywood || Southampton || Police believe that when 36-year-old Ricky Haywood was shot five times in the flat above the jewellery shop he owned, it was probably by a professional hitman acting on behalf of someone whom Ricky had got on the wrong side of. An \u00a3100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction for his murder is still on offer. |- | November 1989 || Carmel Gamble || Stroud, Gloucestershire || Firemen called to a blaze at a holiday cottage in Rodborough on Remembrance Sunday found the remains of the 43-year-old woman inside.

Terry was 39 and Maxine was 32. It's been suggested that Terry was murdered because it was feared that he would blow the whistle over a scam he had found out about in his job as a stocktaker, and that Maxine was murdered too because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. |} ",
