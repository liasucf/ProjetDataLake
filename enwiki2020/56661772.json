    "text": "In mathematics, the automorphism group of an object X is the group consisting of automorphisms of X. For example, if X is a finite-dimensional vector space, then the automorphism group of X is the general linear group of X, the group of invertible linear transformations from X to itself. Especially in geometric contexts, an automorphism group is also called a symmetry group. A subgroup of an automorphism group is called a transformation group (especially in old literature). == Examples == *The automorphism group of a set X is precisely the symmetric group of X. *A group homomorphism to the automorphism group of a set X amounts to a group action on X: indeed, each left G-action on a set X determines G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(X), \\, g \\mapsto \\sigma_g, \\, \\sigma_g(x) = g \\cdot x, and, conversely, each homomorphism \\varphi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(X) defines an action by g \\cdot x = \\varphi(g)x. *Let A, B be two finite sets of the same cardinality and \\operatorname{Iso}(A, B) the set of all bijections A \\ \\overset{\\sim}\\to\\ B. Then \\operatorname{Aut}(B), which is a symmetric group (see above), acts on \\operatorname{Iso}(A, B) from the left freely and transitively; that is to say, \\operatorname{Iso}(A, B) is a torsor for \\operatorname{Aut}(B) (cf. #In category theory). *The automorphism group G of a finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^* with the isomorphism given by \\overline{a} \\mapsto \\sigma_a \\in G, \\, \\sigma_a(x) = x^a. In particular, G is an abelian group. *Given a field extension L/K, its automorphism group is the group consisting of field automorphisms of L that fix K: it is better known as the Galois group of L/K. *The automorphism group of the projective n-space over a field k is the projective linear group \\operatorname{PGL}_n(k). *The automorphism group of a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra \\mathfrak{g} has the structure of a (real) Lie group (in fact, it is even a linear algebraic group: see below). If G is a Lie group with Lie algebra \\mathfrak{g}, then the automorphism group of G has a structure of a Lie group induced from that on the automorphism group of \\mathfrak{g}.(following ) First, if G is simply connected, the automorphism group of G is that of \\mathfrak{g}. Second, every connected Lie group is of the form \\widetilde{G}/C where \\widetilde{G} is a simply connected Lie group and C is a central subgroup and the automorphism group of G is the automorphism group of G that preserves C. Third, by convention, a Lie group is second countable and has at most coutably many connected components; thus, the general case reduces to the connected case. *Let P be a finitely generated projective module over a ring R. Then there is an embedding \\operatorname{Aut}(P) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{GL}_n(R), unique up to inner automorphisms. == In category theory == Automorphism groups appear very naturally in category theory. If X is an object in a category, then the automorphism group of X is the group consisting of all the invertible morphisms from X to itself. It is the unit group of the endomorphism monoid of X. (For some examples, see PROP.) If A, B are objects in some category, then the set \\operatorname{Iso}(A, B) of all A \\overset{\\sim}\\to B is a left \\operatorname{Aut}(B)-torsor. In practical terms, this says that a different choice of a base point of \\operatorname{Iso}(A, B) differs unambiguously by an element of \\operatorname{Aut}(B), or that each choice of a base point is precisely a choice of a trivialization of the torsor. If X_1 and X_2 are objects in categories C_1 and C_2, and if F: C_1 \\to C_2 is a functor mapping X_1 to X_2, then F induces a group homomorphism \\operatorname{Aut}(X_1) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(X_2), as it maps invertible morphisms to invertible morphisms. In particular, if G is a group viewed as a category with a single object * or, more generally, if G is a groupoid, then each functor G \\to C, C a category, is called an action or a representation of G on the object F(*), or the objects F(\\operatorname{Obj}(G)). Those objects are then said to be G-objects (as they are acted by G); cf. \\mathbb{S}-object. If C is a module category like the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then G-objects are also called G-modules. == Automorphism group functor == Let M be a finite- dimensional vector space over a field k that is equipped with some algebraic structure (that is, M is a finite-dimensional algebra over k). It can be, for example, an associative algebra or a Lie algebra. Now, consider k-linear maps M \\to M that preserve the algebraic structure: they form a vector subspace \\operatorname{End}_{\\text{alg}}(M) of \\operatorname{End}(M). The unit group of \\operatorname{End}_{\\text{alg}}(M) is the automorphism group \\operatorname{Aut}(M). When a basis on M is chosen, \\operatorname{End}(M) is the space of square matrices and \\operatorname{End}_{\\text{alg}}(M) is the zero set of some polynomial equations, and the invertibility is again described by polynomials. Hence, \\operatorname{Aut}(M) is a linear algebraic group over k. Now base extensions applied to the above discussion determines a functor: namely, for each commutative ring R over k, consider the R-linear maps M \\otimes R \\to M \\otimes R preserving the algebraic structure: denote it by \\operatorname{End}_{\\text{alg}}(M \\otimes R). Then the unit group of the matrix ring \\operatorname{End}_{\\text{alg}}(M \\otimes R) over R is the automorphism group \\operatorname{Aut}(M \\otimes R) and R \\mapsto \\operatorname{Aut}(M \\otimes R) is a group functor: a functor from the category of commutative rings over k to the category of groups. Even better, it is represented by a scheme (since the automorphism groups are defined by polynomials): this scheme is called the automorphism group scheme and is denoted by \\operatorname{Aut}(M). In general, however, an automorphism group functor may not be represented by a scheme. == See also == *Outer automorphism group *Level structure, a trick to kill an automorphism group *Holonomy group == References == * * * * * == External links == *https://mathoverflow.net/questions/55042/automorphism-group-of-a-scheme Category:Group automorphisms ",
