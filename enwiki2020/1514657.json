In 1895, John Herron bequeathed most of his fortune (almost $250,000) to the Association, which was headed by suffragette May Wright Sewall. Herron stipulated that the money be used to build a museum and art school in his name. (Based on inflation, $250,000 in 1895 would be equivalent to $7,002,734 in 2014). ;1900s Due to Herron's gift, the John Herron Art Institute was formed in 1902 in Indianapolis to serve as an art museum and an art school. The Institute's Herron Museum, an Italian Renaissance Reviva-style building, was designed by Vonnegut and Bohn architects and located at 1701 North Pennsylvania Street in the present-day Morton Place. The Institute's main building was designed by Paul Philippe Cret in 1929, and was the second facility in the nation designed specifically for art education. The first core faculty included Indiana Impressionist painters of the Hoosier Group: T.C. Steele, J. Ottis Adams, William Forsyth, Richard Gruelle, and Otto Stark. The sculptor Rudolph Schwarz was also in the first core faculty. 200px IUPUI campus sign for Herron School of Art and Design. ;1960s Fesler Hall (1962), a major addition to the former John Herron Art Institute site along North Pennsylvania was Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III's first civic commission. The three-story academic building was a freestanding wing addition that connected via covered walkway to the original, Cret-designed main building. Both of these structures are still standing. Woollen's addition was noted for its use of reinforced concrete and exposed columns, which are typical of Brutalist architecture, and its deeply coffered ceilings. See: \"Biographical\" Sketch in See also: Mary Ellen Gadski, \"Woollen, Molzan and Partners\" in See also: The project was funded through a bequest of Caroline Marmon Fesler, a former board member and president of the Indianapolis Art Association (which became the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1969). In 1967, the Herron School of Art became a school of Indiana University. Two years later, it became part of IUPUI\u2014Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, located near downtown Indianapolis. In 1970, the Indianapolis Museum of Art separated from the school, taking with it a majority of Herron's art collection. left Eskenazi Hall entrance, Herron School of Art and Design, IUPUI campus. ;2000s The Herron School of Art and Design launched a capital campaign to raise funds for new buildings in 1999, and in 2000 a ceramic arts facility was opened. In 2003 The Herron Chronicle was published detailing the past 100 years of the school's history. In 2005, Eskenazi Hall, the current home of the school, was completed. This facility tripled the amount of space available to Herron students and includes a library, a 240-seat auditorium, of gallery space, and several computer labs. The original Herron art school's buildings now house Herron High School, a classical liberal arts charter high school. They are within the Herron-Morton Place Historic District. ==Benefactors== Caroline Marmon Fesler: The daughter of local industrialist and automobile manufacturer Daniel W. Marmon (Ray Harroun drove a Marmon car to victory in the first Indianapolis 500 race in 1911), she studied painting in Europe. Later, she became a well-known art collector, especially of 20th-century modernist works, many of which she later gave to the Herron Museum\u2014including Grey Hills by her friend, Georgia O'Keeffe. Along with Sullivan, Fesler propelled the Herron Museum into the era of modern art. Herman C. Krannert: Founder and president of Inland Container Corporation, Krannert agreed to take charge of the Art Association in 1960, at a point when the organization was struggling to stay afloat. Krannert insisted the group reorganize its board and its way of doing business, including creating the position of board chairman\u2014he became the first person to have that title and he held it for 12 years. His tenure culminated in the relocation of the Museum from the Herron campus at 16th and Pennsylvania streets to its current 38th St. and Michigan Road site, and the Art Association's name changed to the Indianapolis Museum of Art. ==References== ==External links== *Herron.iupui.edu: official IUPUI Herron School of Art and Design website **Iupui.edu: official IUPUI\u2014Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis website *Indianapolis Museum of Art blog: the 125th IMA Anniversary \"Power to the People\" exhibit \u2014 history of IMA. *National Park Service: Herron-Morton Place Historic District, Indianapolis *A biography of John Herron by Donald Prell Category:Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis Category:Art schools in Indiana Category:Design schools in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1902 Category:1902 establishments in Indiana Category:Hoosier Group landscape painters Category:Art galleries in Indiana Category:Tourist attractions in Indianapolis ",
