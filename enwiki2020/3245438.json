    "text": "The phonological system of the Polish language is similar in many ways to those of other Slavic languages, although there are some characteristic features found in only a few other languages of the family, such as contrasting retroflex and palatal fricatives and affricates, and nasal vowels. The vowel system is relatively simple, with just six oral monophthongs and two nasals, while the consonant system is much more complex. == Vowels == Polish oral vowels depicted on a vowel diagram, from . Main allophones (in black) are in broad transcription, and positional allophones (in red and green) are in narrow transcription. The central vowel is an unstressed allophone of in certain contexts. The Polish vowel system consists of six oral monophthongs and two nasal diphthongs. Vowel nasality in Polish is partially preserved from Proto-Slavic, having been lost in most other modern Slavic languages. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Monophthong phonemes ! !

Phonetically, they consist of an oral vowel followed by a nasal semivowel (s\u0105 is pronounced , which sounds closer to Portuguese s\u00e3o than French sont \u2013 all three words mean \"[they] are\"). Therefore, they are phonetically diphthongs., citing , , . (For nasality following other vowel nuclei, see \u00a7 Allophony below.) are also less commonly transcribed respectively, such as by the PWN-Oxford Polish-English Dictionary. ===Distribution=== The vowels and have largely complementary distribution. Either vowel may follow a labial consonant, as in mi ('to me') and my ('we'). Elsewhere, however, is usually restricted to word-initial position and positions after palatal consonants and the palatalized velars, while cannot appear in those positions (see \u00a7 Hard and soft consonants below). In some phonological descriptions of Polish that make a phonemic distinction between palatized and unpalatized labials, and may thus be treated as allophones of a single phoneme. However, appears outside its usual positions in some foreign- derived words, as in czipsy ('potato chips') and tir ('large lorry', see TIR). In the past, was closer to , which is acoustically more similar to . Nasal vowels do not occur except before a fricative and in word-final position. When the letters \u0105 and \u0119 appear before stops and affricates, they indicate an oral or followed by a nasal consonant homorganic with the following consonant. For example, k\u0105t is ('angle'), g\u0119ba ('mouth') is , and pi\u0119\u0107 ('five') is , as if they were spelled *kont, *gemba, and *pie\u0144\u0107. Before or , nasality is lost altogether and the vowels are pronounced as oral or . It is also very common to denasalize to in word-final position, as in \"I will be\". An alternative analysis postulates that nasal vowels no longer exist in Standard Polish as independent phonemes because they are realized as actual nasal consonants before stops and affricates, and their nasal-diphthong realization before fricatives can be analyzed as an allophonic realization of the sequences , or likewise. Moreover, studies indicate that the nasalization of the presumed nasal diphthongs \u0105 and \u0119 is no longer distinctive to native speakers in word- final position either and is retained only in emphatic, hypercorrect or artificial speech. ===Historical development=== Distinctive vowel length was inherited from late Proto-Slavic, with some changes (for example, stressed acute and circumflex vowels, and some long vowels occurring after the stress, were shortened). Additional vowel lengths were introduced in Proto-Polish (as in other West Slavic languages) as a result of compensatory lengthening when a yer in the next syllable disappeared. If a yer (or other vowel) disappeared, the preceding vowel became long (unless it was also a yer, in which case it became a short e). This system of vowel lengths is well preserved in Czech and to a lesser degree in Slovak. In the emerging modern Polish, however, the long vowels were shortened again but sometimes (depending on dialect) with a change in quality (the vowels tended to become higher). The latter changes came to be incorporated into the standard language only in the case of long o and the long nasal vowel, mostly for vowels located before voiced obstruents. The vowel shift may thus be presented as follows: * long oral \u2192 short oral (certain dialects: ) * long oral \u2192 short oral (certain dialects: or ) * long oral or \u2192 short oral or * long oral \u2192 short oral , written \u00f3 * long oral \u2192 short oral , written u * long nasal \u2192 short nasal , written \u0105 Note that the that was once a long is still distinguished in script as \u00f3. Former long was written \u00e9 until the 19th century (\u00e1 for long was already in disuse). In most circumstances, consonants were palatalized when followed by an original front vowel, including the soft yer (\u044c) that was often later lost. For example: *d\u044cn\u044c became dzie\u0144 ('day'), while *d\u044cn\u044cm\u044a became dniem ('day' instr.). Nasal vowels *\u0119 and *\u01eb of late Proto-Slavic merged (*\u0119 leaving a trace by palatalizing the preceding consonant) to become the medieval Polish vowel , written \u00f8. Like other Polish vowels, it developed long and short variants. The short variant developed into present-day \u0119, while the long form became , written \u0105, as described above. Overall: * Proto-Slavic *\u0119 \u2192 i\u0119 when short, i\u0105 when long (where the i represents palatalization of the preceding consonant) * Proto-Slavic *\u01eb \u2192 \u0119 when short, \u0105 when long The historical shifts are the reason for the alternations o:\u00f3 and \u0119:\u0105 commonly encountered in Polish morphology: *rog\u044a ('horn') became r\u00f3g due to the loss of the following yer (originally pronounced with a long o, now with /u/), and the instrumental case of the same word went from *rog\u044am\u044a to rogiem (with no lengthening of the o). Similarly, *d\u01ebb\u044a ('oak') became d\u0105b (originally with the long form of the nasal vowel), and in the instrumental case, *d\u01ebb\u044am\u044a the vowel remained short, causing the modern d\u0119bem. ===Dialectal variation=== Polish dialects differ particularly in their realization of nasal vowels, both in terms of whether and when they are decomposed to an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant and in terms of the quality of the vowels used. Also, some dialects preserve nonstandard developments of historical long vowels (see previous section); for example, a may be pronounced with in words in which it was historically long. == Consonants == The Polish consonant system is more complicated; its characteristic features include the series of affricates and palatal consonants that resulted from four Proto-Slavic palatalizations and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish and Belarusian. The consonant phonemes of Polish are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" | Labial ! rowspan=\"2\" | Dental, Alveolar ! rowspan=\"2\" | Retroflex ! rowspan=\"2\" | Palatal ! colspan=\"2\" | Velar |- ! ! |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Nasal | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive ! | | | | | | |- ! | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Affricate ! | | | | | | |- ! | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Fricative ! | | | | | | |- ! | | | | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Tap/Trill | | | | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Approximant | | | | | | |} Alveolar are allophones of before . Denti-alveolar is an allophone of before dental consonants. has been traditionally classified as a trill, with a tap supposedly only occurring as an allophone or in fast speech. However, more recent studies show that /r/ is predominantly realized as a tap, sometimes as an approximant or a fricative, but almost never as a trill. One study found that in an intervocalic context a trilled [r] occurs in less than 3% of cases, while a tapped [\u027e] occurred in approximately 95% of cases. Another study by the same researcher showed that in a postconsonantal position, /r/ is realized as a tapped [\u027e] in 80-90% of cases, while trilled [r] occurs in just 1.5% of articulations. The fricatives and affricates shown as retroflex may instead be transcribed as palato-alveolar consonants with , etc. However, they are more accurately described as retroflex although they are laminal (like the retroflexes of Standard Chinese). They may therefore also be transcribed phonetically with the symbols etc., indicating the laminal feature. The phonemes and are less commonly transcribed as and (as if they were palatal stops). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Example words (click on a word to hear its pronunciation) |- !

The alveolo-palatals are pronounced with the body of the tongue raised to the palate. The series are known as \"rustling\" (szeleszcz\u0105ce) and \"humming\" (szumi\u0105ce) respectively; the equivalent alveolar series (s, z, c, dz) is called \"hissing\" (sycz\u0105ce). Polish contrasts affricates and stop\u2013fricative clusters by the fricatives being longer in clusters than in affricates: * ('clean' fem.) vs. ('three hundred'). * ' ('jam') with vs. ('take a nap' imper.). The distinction is lost in some Lesser Polish dialects. For the possibility of an additional glottal fricative phoneme for h, see \u00a7 Dialectal variation below. ===Allophony=== has a voiced allophone , which occurs whenever is followed by a voiced obstruent (even across a word boundary), in accordance with the rules given under \u00a7 Voicing and devoicing below. For example, dach ('roof') is , but dach domu ('roof of the house') is . has the strongest friction before consonants , weaker friction before vowels and weakest friction intervocalically, where it may be realized as glottal (this variant \"may appear to be voiced\"). has a velar allophone, , which occurs before velar consonants (as in bank 'bank'). The approximants and may be regarded as non-syllabic vowels when they are not followed by a vowel. For example, raj ('paradise') , da\u0142 ('gave') , autor ('author') . Before fricatives, nasal consonants may be realized as nasalized semivowels, analogous to and (see \u00a7 Vowels above). This occurs in loanwords, and in free variation with the typical consonantal pronunciation (e.g. instynkt 'instinct')., citing Similarly, the palatal nasal in coda position is in free variation with a nasalized palatal approximant . For example, ko\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk ===Distribution=== Polish, like other Slavic languages, permits complex consonant clusters, which often arose from the disappearance of yers (see \u00a7 Historical development above). Polish can have word-initial and word-medial clusters of up to four consonants, whereas word-final clusters can have up to five consonants. Examples of such clusters can be found in words such as bezwzgl\u0119dny ('absolute' or 'heartless', 'ruthless'), \u017ad\u017ab\u0142o ('blade of grass'), ('shock'), and krn\u0105brno\u015b\u0107 ('disobedience'). A popular Polish tongue- twister (from a verse by Jan Brzechwa) is ('In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed'). For the restrictions on combinations of voiced and voiceless consonants in clusters, see \u00a7 Voicing and devoicing below. Unlike languages such as Czech, Polish does not have syllabic consonants: the nucleus of a syllable is always a vowel. The consonant is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede i or y. (For other restrictions on consonants appearing before i or y, see \u00a7 Distribution above.) ===Voicing and devoicing=== Polish obstruents (stops, affricates and fricatives) are subject to voicing and devoicing in certain positions. This leads to neutralization of voiced/voiceless pairs in those positions (or equivalently, restrictions on the distribution of voiced and voiceless consonants). The phenomenon applies in word-final position and in consonant clusters. In Polish consonant clusters, including across a word boundary, the obstruents are all voiced or all voiceless. To determine (based on the spelling of the words) whether a given cluster has voiced or voiceless obstruents, the last obstruent in the cluster, excluding w or rz (but including \u017c), should be examined to see if appears to be voiced or voiceless. The consonants n, m, \u0144, r, j, l, \u0142 do not represent obstruents and so do not affect the voicing of other consonants; they are also usually not subject to devoicing except when surrounded by unvoiced consonants. Some examples follow (click the words to hear them spoken): * ('boat'), \u2192 before the voiceless k * ('jackdaw'), \u2192 before the voiceless k * ('also'), \u2192 before the voiced \u017c * ('as if'), \u2192 before the voiced b * ('bush'), \u2192 ; rz does not determine the voicing of the cluster * ('to replay'), \u2192 & \u2192 ; w does not determine the voicing of the cluster * dach domu ('roof of the house'), \u2192 ; the rule still applies across a word boundary In some dialects of Wielkopolska and the eastern borderlands, remains voiced after voiceless consonants. The above rule does not apply to sonorants: a consonant cluster may contain voiced sonorants and voiceless obstruents, as in , , s\u0142o\u0144 , tn\u0105c . At the end of a word, obstruents are pronounced voiceless (unless followed by a word beginning with a voiced obstruent, when the above cluster rules apply). For example, the in b\u00f3g ('god') is pronounced , and the in zajazd ('inn') represents a pronunciation like . However, in some regional dialects, especially in western and southern Poland, final obstruents are voiced if the following word starts with a sonorant (here, for example, the in brat ojca 'father's brother' would be pronounced as ). ===Hard and soft consonants=== Multiple palatalizations and some depalatalizations that took place in the history of Proto-Slavic and Polish have created quite a complex system of what are often called 'soft' and 'hard' consonants. These terms are useful in describing some inflection patterns and other morphological processes, but exact definitions of 'soft' and 'hard' may differ somewhat. 'Soft' generally refers to the palatal nature of a consonant. The alveolo- palatal sounds \u0144, \u015b, \u017a, \u0107, d\u017a are considered soft, as normally is the palatal j. The l sound is also normally classed as a soft consonant: like the preceding sounds, it cannot be followed by y but takes i instead. The palatalized velars , and might also be regarded as soft on this basis. Consonants not classified as soft are dubbed 'hard'. However, a subset of hard consonants, c, dz, sz, \u017c/rz, cz, d\u017c, often derive from historical palatalizations (for example, rz usually represents a historical palatalized r) and behaves like the soft consonants in some respects (for example, they normally take e in the nominative plural). These sounds may be called 'hardened' or 'historically soft' consonants. In some phonological descriptions of Polish, however, a greater number of consonants, including especially the labials m, p, b, f, w, are regarded as occurring in 'hard' and 'soft' pairs. In this approach, for example, the word pies ('dog') is analysed not as but as , with a soft . These consonants are then also analysed as soft when they precede the vowel (as in pi\u0107 'to drink'), although here the palatalization is hardly audible. Unlike their equivalents in Russian, these consonants cannot retain their softness in the syllable coda (when not followed by a vowel). For example, the word for 'carp' has the inflected forms karpia, karpie etc., with soft (or , depending on the analysis), but the nominative singular is karp, with a hard . The consonants t, d, r (and some others) can also be regarded as having hard and soft forms according to the above approach, although the soft forms occur only in loanwords such as tir ('large lorry'; see TIR). If the distinction is made for all relevant consonants, then y and i can be regarded as allophones of a single phoneme, with y following hard consonants and i following soft ones (and in initial position). The historical palatalized forms of some consonants have developed in Polish into noticeably different sounds: historical palatalized t, d, r have become the sounds now represented by \u0107, d\u017a, rz respectively. Similarly palatalized s, z, n became the sounds \u015b, \u017a, \u0144. The palatalization of labials has resulted (according to the main phonological analysis given in the sections above) in the addition of , as in the example pies just given. These developments are reflected in some regular morphological changes in Polish grammar, such as in noun declension. ===Glottal stop=== In more contemporary Polish, a phonetic glottal stop may appear as the onset of a vowel-initial word (e.g. Ala ).Magdalena Osowicka-Kondratowicz, \"Zwarcie krtaniowe \u2013 rodzaj fonacji czy artykulacji?\", Rocznik Slawistyczny, t. LXVII, 2018 , p. 41 It may also appear following word-final vowels to connote particular affects; for example, nie ('no') is normally pronounced , but may instead be pronounced or in a prolonged interrupted . This intervocalic glottal stop may also break up a vowel hiatus, even when one appears morpheme-internally, as in poeta ('poet') or Ukraina ('Ukraine') . A relatively new phenomenon in Polish is the expansion of the usage of glottal stops. In the past, initial vowels were pronounced with an initial voiceless glottal fricative (so that Ala was pronounced ), pre-iotation (so that ig\u0142a 'needle' was pronounced ), or pre- labialization (so that oko 'eye' was pronounced ).Osowicka-Kondratowicz, 2018 p. 40 ===Dialectal variation=== In some Polish dialects (found in the eastern borderlands and in Upper Silesia) there is an additional voiced glottal fricative , represented by the letter . In standard Polish, both and represent . Some eastern dialects also preserve the velarized dental lateral approximant, , which corresponds with in standard Polish. Those dialects also can palatalize () in every position, but standard Polish does so only allophonically before and . and are also common realizations in native speakers of Polish from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. notes that students of Polish philology were hostile towards the lateral variant of , saying that it sounded \"unnatural\" and \"awful\". Some of the students also said that they perceived the lateral as a variant of , which, he further notes, along with the necessity of deciding from context whether the sound meant was or , made people hostile towards the sound. On the other hand, some Poles view the lateral variant with nostalgia, associating it with the elegant culture of interwar Poland. In the Masurian dialect and some neighbouring dialects, mazurzenie occurs: retroflex merge with the corresponding dentals unless is spelled (a few centuries ago, it represented a palatalized trill , distinct from ; only the latter sound occurs in modern Polish). == Prosody == The predominant stress pattern in Polish is penultimate: the second-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress: in a four-syllable word, if the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first., deferring to for further discussion. Each vowel represents one syllable although the letter i normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents , palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis; see Polish orthography and the above). Also, the letters u and i sometimes represent only semivowels after another vowel, as in autor ('author'), mostly in loanwords (so not in native nauka 'science, the act of learning', for example, nor in nativized Mateusz 'Matthew'). Some loanwords, particularly from classical languages, have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-last) syllable. For example, fizyka () ('physics') is stressed on the first syllable. That may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement: muzyka 'music' vs. muzyka - genitive singular of muzyk 'musician'. When additional syllables are added to such words through inflection or suffixation, the stress normally becomes regular: uniwersytet (, 'university') has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive uniwersytetu () and derived adjective uniwersytecki () have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Over time, loanwords become nativized to have a penultimate stress. Another class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings -by, -bym, -by\u015bmy etc. Those endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress: zrobi\u0142bym ('I would do') is stressed on the first syllable and zrobiliby\u015bmy ('we would do') on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings -\u015bmy, -\u015bcie although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so zrobili\u015bmy 'we did' is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as zrobili\u015bmy).Phonetics and Phonology of lexical stress in Polish verbs, Dominika Oliver, Martine Grice, Institute of Phonetics, Saarland University, Germany The irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of kogo zobaczyli\u015bcie? ('whom did you see?') it is possible to say kogo\u015bcie zobaczyli? \u2013 here kogo retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns. Some common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. That applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as do niej ('to her'), na nas ('on us'), przeze mnie ('because of me'), all stressed on the bolded syllable. == See also == * Evolution of the Polish language * Polish alphabet * Polish orthography * Help:IPA/Polish (a guide to pronunciation of Polish words as represented in Wikipedia articles) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * ==External links== * Polish Pronunciation Audio and Grammar Charts phonology Category:Slavic phonologies ",
