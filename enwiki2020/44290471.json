    "text": "The Rivers State People's Democratic Party, also referred to as Rivers PDP, is the state chapter of the People's Democratic Party in Rivers State, Nigeria. It is currently chaired by businessman and Philanthropist Felix Obuah. Prominent public figures including the late Nigerian senator Ibiapuye Martyns- Yellowe and former governor and Committee Chair on State Creation Peter Odili are products of Rivers PDP. ==Party history== Since the party's foundation in the late nineties, it has remained dominant for most of the state's political history winning several governorships as well as occupying majority of seats in both the House of Assembly and the National Assembly. Marshal Harry, a Kalabari High Chief was the first member in its fold to be appointed to the Chairperson rank. In the elections of 2007, the party emerged highly successful, and maintained itself in power and in the elections of 2011, it won a total of 16 seats and held control of all state offices including the governorship. During November 2013, the Rivers State People's Democratic Party saw the defection of its member Chibuike Amaechi to the opposition APC. This was followed by the departure of two senators, Magnus Abe, representing Rivers South-East; and Wilson Ake, representing Rivers West in early 2014. The drawbacks, however, did not deter the party, who went on to retain its significant political strength in the 2015 elections. ==Current officeholders== At present, the party controls all 16 seats in the National Assembly. ===Members of the Senate=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:20em\"|Senator ! style=\"width:20em\"|Constituency |- | Osinakachukwu Ideozu | Rivers West |- | George Thompson Sekibo | Rivers East |} ===House of Representatives=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:20em\"|Representative ! style=\"width:20em\"|Constituency |- |Awaji Inombek Abiante ||Andoni/Opobo/Nkoro |- |Kingsley Ogundu Chinda ||Obio/Akpor |- |Jacobson Nbina ||Oyigbo/Tai/Eleme |- |Blessing Ibiba Nsiegbe ||Port Harcourt II |- |Jerome Amadi Eke |Etche/Omuma |- |Boma Goodhead ||Asari- Toru/Akuku-Toru |- |Bright Gogo Tamuno ||Okrika/Ogu\u2013Bolo |- |Dumnamene Ransom Dekor ||Khana/Gokana |- |Kenneth Anayo Chikere ||Port Harcourt I |- |Prince (Hon.)
