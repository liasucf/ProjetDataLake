Her brother, Roger, became a stage designer and painter who also worked in films. She was educated at St Paul's Girls' School and studied theatre at the Old Vic in the early 1930s. By the end of that decade, she became a stage actress. One of Judith Furse's earliest film successes was as Sister Briony in Black Narcissus (1947). She was known for her heavy-set, somewhat masculine looks, and was often cast as overbearing types such as the villainous Doctor Crow in Carry On Spying (1964). Other films included The Man in the White Suit (1951), Mother Riley Meets the Vampire (1952), Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957), Carry On Regardless (1961), Live Now, Pay Later (1962) and Carry On Cabby (1963). One of her more sympathetic roles was as Flora, Greer Garson's concerned travelling companion, in the original Goodbye, Mr Chips (1939). In 1972 she made her last film appearance, as a drag king, in the Australian film The Adventures of Barry McKenzie. ==Partial filmography== * Goodbye, Mr Chips (1939) \u2013 Flora * A Canterbury Tale (1944) \u2013 Dorothy Bird * English Without Tears (1944) \u2013 Elise Batter-Jones * Johnny Frenchman (1945) \u2013 Jane Matthews * Quiet Weekend (1946) \u2013 Ella Spender * While the Sun Shines (1947) \u2013 Female Receptionist * Black Narcissus (1947) \u2013 Sister Briony * One Night with You (1948) \u2013 Second Writer * Bond Street (1948) \u2013 Miss Lane (uncredited) * It's Hard to Be Good (1948) \u2013 Sister Taylor (uncredited) * Marry Me!
