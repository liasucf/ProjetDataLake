    "text": "Posthumous Success is the 2009 album by Tom Brosseau. == Album insight == The album cover, a photo by Autumn de Wilde, shows Tom Brosseau, Sara Watkins, and Largo owner, Mark Flanagan, standing backstage in a mirrored hallway. Design and layout were created by longtime Brosseau collaborator, DLT. Blurb from FatCat Records: \"Tom Brosseau\u2019s third full-length for FatCat marks a huge stylistic shift away from the spare, acoustic arrangements of his previous releases. Two producers, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade) and Ethan Rose (Small Sails), helming alternate tracks - along with a small army of guest musicians - help Brosseau flesh and clothe his songs\u2019 sturdy skeletons, lending them breath, presence, and limb-stretching immediacy. Unchanged, however, are Brosseau's earnest wit, near-unearthly emotional grasp, and captivating, vibrato-soaked voice. With Posthumous Success (named after a chapter from a biography of Albert Camus), Brosseau brings his best group of songs into a sonically rich environment, and the result is buoyant, well-crafted, and sprawlingly lovely - his most accomplished and inviting effort to date.\" == Track listing == # \"My Favorite Color Blue\" # \"Been True\" # \"Big Time\" # \"Boothill\" # \"You Don't Know My Friends\" # \"Love To New Heights\" # \"Youth Decay\" # \"Give Me A Drumroll\" # \"Miss Lucy\" # \"Axe & Stump\" # \"Chandler, AZ\" # \"Wishbone Medallion\" # \"My Favorite Color Blue\" == Personnel == * Tom Brosseau: Vocals, acoustic and electric guitar * Adam Pierce: Drums on tracks 2, 3, 5, and 10 * Rob Laakso: Electric guitar on tracks 2, 3, 5 * Gary Jimmerson: Drums on tracks 6, 8, 12, and 13 * Ethan Rose: Synthesizers on tracks 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13; Banjo on track 4 * Adam Porterfield: Loops on track 6 * Shelley Short: Backing vocals in tracks 4 and 12 * Jayme Layne: Vocals on track 3 * Jeremy Backofen: Audio engineer, additional vocals * Rob King: Fender Rhodes ==References== Category:2009 albums Category:Tom Brosseau albums ",
