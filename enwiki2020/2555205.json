    "text": "Thelma Louise Mandrell (born July 13, 1954) is an American country music singer. She is the younger sister of fellow country singer Barbara Mandrell, and older sister of actress Irlene Mandrell. Louise had a successful singing career in country music from the 1970s, with a string of hits during the 1980s. ==Early life== Thelma Louise Mandrell was born July 13, 1954 to Mary Ellen (n\u00e9e McGill; born 1931) and Irby Matthew Mandrell (October 11, 1924 - March 5, 2009) in Corpus Christi, Texas. She is the second of three daughters. Sister Barbara is five and a half years older; sister Irlene is one and a half years younger. Her mother, Mary, was a homemaker and musician hailing from rural Wayne County, Illinois. Her father Irby was a World War II naval veteran and Texas police officer from Garland County, Arkansas. Irby Mandrell was an accomplished musician and entrepreneur as well. He used his impeccable social skills and knowledge of the music industry to manage all three of his daughters' careers for over 3 decades. Although Louise Mandrell never developed the scale of fan base or the worldwide recognition that her older sister Barbara gained in country music, she is still credited as one of country music's more successful female vocalists of the 1980s. With their parents coming from a musical background, Barbara started off working as a singer, and playing the steel guitar and other instruments, and toured with Patsy Cline in the early 1960s. Louise learned to play the guitar and bass. Soon, their parents founded the Mandrell Family Band, which toured the United States and Asia. Barbara's professional recognition in country music in the early 1970s with hits like \"Treat Him Right\", \"Show Me\" and \"The Midnight Oil\" gave Louise opportunities at success. She started performing in Barbara's band The DoRites, which toured with Merle Haggard in the early 1970s. Her first time in the studio was on the recording \"Always Wanting You\", a no. 1 hit for Haggard in 1975. In 1978, Louise signed with Epic Records. ==Music career== Mandrell released her first single in 1978, called \"Put It on Me\", which entered the top 100 country music singles in the USA. In 1979 she released her next single, a cover version of \"Everlasting Love\", which also entered top 100. She started singing duets with her husband R.C. Bannon, such as \"I Thought You'd Never Ask,\" which entered the top 50, and a cover of the number one song by Peaches & Herb, \"Reunited\", which went to number 13, her first significant hit. In 1980, following two more solo efforts that did not see the same success, she joined sisters Barbara and Irlene on the TV variety show Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters. This show showcased not only her singing, but her multi-instrumental and comedy talents as well. In 1981, she signed with RCA Records. In 1982, Mandrell had two top 40 hits, as well as the top 20 hit \"Some of My Best Friends Are Old Songs\". 1983 turned out to be her most successful year. She entered the top 15 with \"Runaway Heart,\" and had the two top 10 hits \"Save Me\" (originally recorded by Northern Irish singer Clodagh Rodgers) and \"Too Hot to Sleep\". In 1984, Mandrell had two other Top 40 hits, \"Goodbye Heartache\" and \"I'm Not Through Loving You Yet,\" and in 1985 the song \"I Wanna Say Yes\" entered the top 5. In 1985, RCA released her first video for the hit single \"Some Girls Have All The Luck\". Her songs at this time focused on the popular Countrypolitan sound that was coming out of Nashville from many country artists, Barbara Mandrell included. Mandrell's last studio album \"Dreamin'\" was released in 1987, with the single \"I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips\" and having her last top 40 hit with the single \"Do I Have To Say Goodbye\". Her last charted single came in 1988, a cover of the song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\", a duet with Eric Carmen. RCA dropped Mandrell in 1988. During the 1990s she released the videos and songs \"Jean Paul\" and \"Down Home Christmas\". ==Personal life== Her marriage to Ronald Shaw on July 1, 1971, ended in divorce in 1973. She subsequently married Gary Lamar Buck of the country music group The Four Guys on July 23, 1975. They later divorced in 1978. In 1978, Mandrell met R.C. Bannon. They married on February 26, 1979. He would later co-write songs for Barbara. \"One of a Kind, Pair of Fools\" is a 1983 single written by Bannon and John Bettis and recorded by Barbara Mandrell. \"Only One Love in My Life,\" written by R.C. Bannon and John Bettis, would be Ronnie Milsap's tenth number one. Louise and R.C. adopted Nicole Mandrell Shipley in 1986. Louise was divorced from R.C. in 1991 and married John Haywood on July 16, 1993. Louise became a grandmother for the first time in 2013. ==Theater and writing== After leaving RCA Records, Mandrell continued to perform almost every day to packed houses. In 1991, TNN began re-airing the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters Show. From 1992 to 1994, she headlined at the 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre in Branson, Missouri along with Kenny Rogers.

Mandrell appeared in every performance there, encompassed numerous musical styles including country, jazz, and big band. It was considered the most attended (non-dinner) show in the Smoky Mountains. The Triumphant Quartet, formerly known as the Integrity Quartet, was the in-house southern gospel group and back-up singers for Louise. The Louise Mandrell Theater had its last performance, to a sold-out house, on December 31, 2005. Mandrell sold the theater afterwards and it has changed hands twice since. The theater is now home to the \"Smoky Mountain Opry.\" In 1983, Mandrell co-wrote the Mandrell Family Album with writer Ace Collins. Later, they produced a series of children's books. In 2012, she performed the title role of \"Calamity Jane\" at Roger Rocka's Dinner Theatre in Fresno, California through September 16, 2012.
