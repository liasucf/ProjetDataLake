    "text": "Paul Percival \"Ray\" Brown (January 31, 1889 - May 29, 1955) was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Brown pitched in just one big-league game, twirling a complete-game victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on September 29, 1909 at age 20. He allowed just five hits to the Phillies, walking four and striking out two in his single day on the mound at West Side Park. At the plate, he had no hits in three at-bats, but did earn a run batted in. By virtue of his brief moment in the spotlight, Brown became the tenth-youngest man to play in the National League in 1909. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Moose Jaw Robin Hoods players Category:Sioux City Packers players Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Baseball players from Illinois ",
