The Kfz 13 was based on a civilian car, the Adler Standard 6. Although the Kfz 13 was equipped with all-wheel drive, the vehicle had poor cross-country capability. The unarmed version, the Kfz 14 communications vehicle, was equipped with a radio set instead of the machine gun. The Kfz 13 was deployed in the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France. It was retired from active service in 1941 and only used thereafter for training purposes. == Technical data == * Weight: 2.1 t * Length: 4.2 m * Width: 1.7 m * Engine: water-cooled six cylinder inline engine from the Adler \"Standard 6\" with 51 horsepower and a capacity of 2,916 cm\u00b3 * Top speed (on road): 70 km/h. * Fuel capacity : 70 l * Range: 380 km * Crew: 2 (Kfz 13), 3 (Kfz 14) * Armament: MG 13, later MG 34 with 1,000 rounds of ammunition * Armour: around 8 mm * Manufacturer: Daimler-Benz * Years of manufacture: 1932 to 1934 * Quantity: 147 (Kfz 13), 40 (Kfz. 14) == See also == * List of German military equipment of World War II * D-8 Armored Car - Contemporary Soviet design based on Ford Model A. ==External links== * Maschinengewehrkraftwagen Kfz.13 at www.achtungpanzer.com.
