    "text": "The Sherbrooke Indians were a minor league baseball team located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. They played in the Provincial League from 1948 to 1951 as the Sherbrooke Athletics and again from 1953 to 1955 as the Indians. They won the first Provincial League pennant in 1948. In 1951, they won a second pennant, but five hours after their final game, their stadium burned down, forcing the team to sit out the 1952 season as the ballpark was rebuilt. When they returned to action in 1953, they were affiliated with the Cleveland Indians. ==Season-by-season== {|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\" |- style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\" !
