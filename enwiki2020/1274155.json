    "text": "Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger, 1863 Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger (23 December 1829 \u2013 26 June 1897) was a French chemist. He was born in Strasbourg, where his father Georges Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sch\u00fctzenberger (1779\u20131859) was professor of law, and his uncle Charles Sch\u00fctzenberger (1809\u20131881) professor of chemical medicine. He was intended for a medical career and graduated MD from the University of Strasbourg in 1855, but his interests laid in physical and chemical sciences. In 1853 he went to Paris as preparateur to JF Persoz (1805\u20131868), professor of chemistry at the Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers. A year later he was entrusted with a course of chemical instruction at Mulhouse, and he remained in that town until 1865 as professor at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences. He then returned to Paris as assistant to AJ Balard at the College de France, in 1876 he succeeded him in the chair of chemistry, and in 1882 he became directing professor at the municipal \u00c9cole de Physique et de Chimie. The two latter chairs he held together until his death, which happened at M\u00e9zy, Seine et Oise. During the period he spent at Mulhouse, Sch\u00fctzenberger paid special attention to industrial chemistry, particularly in connection with colouring matters, but he also worked at general and biological chemistry which subsequently occupied the greater part of his time. He is known for a long series of researches on the constitution of alkaloids and of the albuminoid bodies, and for the preparation of several new series of platinum compounds and of hyposulphurous acid, H2S2O4. Towards the end of his life he adopted the view that the elements have been formed by some process of condensation from one primordial substance of extremely small atomic weight, and he expressed the conviction that atomic weights within narrow limits are variable and modified according to the physical conditions in which a compound is formed. His publications include: * Chimie appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la physiologie et \u00e0 la pathologie animale (1863); * Trait\u00e9 des mati\u00e8res colorantes (1867); * Les Fermentations (1875), which was translated into German, Italian and English; * Trait\u00e9 de chimie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale in seven volumes (1880\u20131894). == See also == * French painter Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fctzenberger was his son * French mathematician Marcel- Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger was his great grandson ==References== * ==External links== * * * La Croix (Paris), 1929-11-06; gallica.bnf Category:1829 births Category:1897 deaths Category:People from Strasbourg Category:French chemists Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:ESPCI Paris faculty Category:Coll\u00e8ge de France faculty Category:Textile scientists Category:University of Strasbourg alumni ",
