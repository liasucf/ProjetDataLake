He had an argument (concerning the felling of trees) with John Westaway, the farmer who occupied the barton adjoining the mansion house, and in 1938 he moved to Stodden Park, near Petersfield in Hampshire, having deserted Yeo Vale never to return. His wife died soon after, which greatly affected him. He packed all her clothes into her Buick car and ordered his chauffeur to drive it off a cliff at Stodden Park, which he refused to do, upon which Berrold buried it in a pit and set it alight. He later married a French woman and moved to Africa.Lauder, 1981, p.49 He retained ownership of the building, which was \"literally abandoned and left to die... It stood for many years deserted and empty, gazing forlornly out across the fields, like a dog patiently waiting for its master to return. But he never did\".Lauder, 1981, p.45 The house soon became dilapidated, but nevertheless was given a grade II listing in 1955, and Mr Westcott obtained a licence from the local council to demolish it in 1973. ===Westaway=== The estate of Yeo Vale is now owned by the Westaway family, who operate there a large dairy cattle farm. It is believed the site of Yeo Vale house is still owned by the heirs unknown of Stephen Berrold. ==Notes== ==References== ;Sources *Lauder, Rosemary, Vanished Houses of North Devon, Callington, 1981, pp. 45\u201353, Yeo Vale *Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p. 127 *Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John- William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p. 304, Yoe (sic) *Risdon, Tristram (died 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p. 244 *Vivian, Lt.Col.
