The film has been described as \"semi-autobiographical\" by Mainella and Jadick because it incorporates some of their own personal storylines within fictional scenarios. ==Reception== Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for its cinematography saying that it makes \"this rural gateway enticing\" and the music for being \"intermiittently engaging\". However, he criticized the characters for being thinly drawn and the actors' lack of charisma. He pointed out to Brokeback Mountain, another gay film, for how it should be done. ==References== Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American musical drama films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related musical films Category:2015 LGBT-related films Category:American films ",
