The prime objective of the organization is to make Kizhakkambalam Grama Panchayat the best Grama Panchayat in India by the year 2020. This organization won the unique distinction of winning the elections in the local body elections in 2015 and made Kizhakkambalam the first corporate ruled town of Kerala state. ==History== Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam is promoted by the Kitex Group, a garment manufacturing company local to the area. The interference in many charity activities by competing political parties forced Twenty20 to contest elections. This organization won 17 out of 19 seats and secured the administration of the town. According to Sabu M Jacob, the Managing Director of Kitex Garments, the victory was because of the failure of the political system. Kitex is a garment exporting company founded by the Anna-Kitex group in 1960. The company exports to the tune of 750 Crore Indian rupees. They supply clothes to American and European countries and the company is listed as one of the best Asian companies by Forbes. ==Controversy== The acquisition of the town by Kitex is seen as a threat to democracy. P. Rajeev, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) says, \"It\u2019s a corporate takeover of the panchayat; it\u2019s a threat to democracy, the Kitex company now pays monthly salaries to the panchayat president and the council members, by accepting the salaries, the elected representatives of the village have reduced themselves to be the company\u2019s employees.\" According to Sebastian Paul MP, the company is into charity to evade serious charges of environmental pollution. According to environmental activist C. R. Neelakantan, the company's motive behind the social service was suspicious because the company has violated many environmental safeguards. But the company promises that, if they can run a company worth millions, then they can install advanced technologies to treat the waste water. ==Criticism from corporations== According to some Indian management experts, industrialists have no business directly running a village. They fear that it will start an unhealthy trend. ==Development activities== Twenty20 has taken lead in providing drinking water to the people of Kizhakkambalam. They have also taken interest in making toilets; repairing houses; sponsoring surgeries and wedding; building places of worship and donating seeds and agricultural implements. The organization runs a grocery shop in Kizhakkambalam supplying vegetables and groceries at half the market price. 7,000 families are visiting the market regularly to buy provisions. == Anti alcohol movement == Twenty20 promised to make Kizhakkambalam an alcohol free village. This was the main offer of the organization during the election campaign in November, 2015. And they kept their word by closing down the only beverage outlet available in this area. == Multi specialty hospital == Twenty20 has promised the people that by year 2020 Kizhakkambalam will have a multi specialty hospital in the heart of the town, which people could afford at cheap rates. ==External links== * http://www.2020kizhakkambalam.com/ * http://www.kitexgarments.com/ * http://www.2020enteveedu.com/ * Remaining Time for Kizhakkambalam Panchayat Election 2020 ==References== Category:Suburbs of Kochi ",
