It has a gross leasable area (GLA) of 45,000 square meters. ==History== On March 20, 2015, Ayala Land broke ground at its Central Bloc project, a 2.2 hectare project within Cebu IT Park. One of its components is the Ayala Malls Central Bloc which can cater up to 500 stores. It has five levels of retail development, four digital cinemas, an indoor activity center, a fashion gallery, a food court, a basement supermarket, and a three-level basement parking. The mall was expected to open by October 2019 but was moved to December 6, 2019. According to Ayala Malls VisMin head Clavel Tongco, the mall operates from 11:00 A.M. until 11:00 P.M. with people working in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry as its main target market. ==Incidents== ===Christmas tree fire=== On December 26, 2019, just 20 days after its official opening, the mall's outdoor christmas tree caught fire but was promptly extinguished by its emergency quick response team. It was likely to be caused by faulty wiring according to the Bureau of Fire Protection due to it being exposed in the rain. ==See also== *Ayala Center Cebu *SM City Cebu *SM City Consolacion *SM Seaside City Cebu *Robinsons Galleria Cebu ==References== ==External links== * * Ayala Malls Central Bloc * * Category:Shopping malls in Cebu City Category:Ayala Malls Category:Shopping malls established in 2019 ",
