    "text": "The 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup was the fifth FIFA Confederations Cup and the third to be organised by FIFA. It was also the first in which the original hosts, Saudi Arabia, did not participate (they were the nation who founded the tournament, previously known as the King Fahd Cup). The tournament was played from 30 May to 10 June 2001, and co-hosted by South Korea and Japan, who were also hosts for the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals. It was won by France, beating hosts Japan 1\u20130, with a goal from Patrick Vieira. By winning the tournament, France became the second team to simultaneously be World Cup champions, continental champions and Confederations Cup winners, after Brazil in 1997. The eight teams were split into two groups of four, in which each team plays each of the others once, with the top two in each group advancing to the semi- finals. ==Qualified teams== 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup participating teams {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Confederation !Qualification method !Date qualification secured !Participation no. |- | |AFC |Co-hosts |align=center|31 May 1996 |align=center|1st |- | |AFC |Co-hosts 2000 AFC Asian Cup winners |align=center|31 May 1996 |align=center|2nd |- | |UEFA |1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 winners |align=center|12 July 1998 |align=center|1st |- | |CONMEBOL |1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners |align=center|18 July 1999 |align=center|3rd |- | |CONCACAF |1999 FIFA Confederations Cup winners |align=center|4 August 1999 |align=center|4th |- | |CAF |2000 African Cup of Nations winners |align=center|13 February 2000 |align=center|1st |- | |CONCACAF |2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup winners |align=center|27 February 2000 |align=center|1st |- | |OFC |2000 OFC Nations Cup winners |align=center|28 June 2000 |align=center|2nd |} ==Venues== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"4\" | South Korea |- !Daegu !Ulsan !Suwon ! rowspan=\"4\" | |- |Daegu World Cup Stadium |Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium |Suwon World Cup Stadium |- |Capacity: 68,014 |Capacity: 43,550 |Capacity: 43,188 |- |200x200px |200x200px |200x200px |- ! colspan=\"4\" | Japan |- !Yokohama !Ibaraki !Niigata ! rowspan=\"4\" | |- |International Stadium Yokohama |Kashima Soccer Stadium |Niigata Stadium |- |Capacity: 72,327 |Capacity: 40,728 |Capacity: 42,300 |- |alt= |alt= |alt= |} ==Match referees== ;Africa * Gamal Al-Ghandour * Felix Tangawarima ;Asia * Ali Bujsaim * Lu Jun ;Europe * Hugh Dallas * Hellmut Krug * Kim Milton Nielsen ;North America, Central America and Caribbean * Benito Archundia * Carlos Batres ;Oceania * Simon Micallef ;South America * Byron Moreno * \u00d3scar Ruiz ==Squads== ==Group stage== ===Group A=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !width=\"175\"|Team !width=\"20\"|Pld !width=\"20\"|W !width=\"20\"|D !width=\"20\"|L !width=\"20\"|GF !width=\"20\"|GA !width=\"20\"|GD !width=\"20\"|Pts |- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| |3||2||0||1||9||1||+8||6 |- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| |3||2||0||1||3||1||+2||6 |- |align=left| |3||2||0||1||3||6||\u22123||6 |- |align=left| |3||0||0||3||1||8||\u22127||0 |} \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !width=\"175\"|Team !width=\"20\"|Pld !width=\"20\"|W !width=\"20\"|D !width=\"20\"|L !width=\"20\"|GF !width=\"20\"|GA !width=\"20\"|GD !width=\"20\"|Pts |- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| |3||2||1||0||5||0||+5||7 |- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| |3||1||2||0||2||0||+2||5 |- |align=left| |3||1||0||2||2||4||\u22122||3 |- |align=left| |3||0||1||2||0||5||\u22125||1 |} \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Knockout stage== ===Semi-finals=== \\---- ===Third place play-off=== ===Final=== ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto\" |- !Golden Ball !Golden Shoe !FIFA Fair Play Trophy |- |align=center| Robert Pires |align=center| Robert Pires |rowspan=\"5\" align=center| |- !Silver Ball !Silver Shoe |- |align=center| Patrick Vieira |align=center| \u00c9ric Carri\u00e8re |- !Bronze Ball !Bronze Shoe |- |align=center| Hidetoshi Nakata |align=center| Hwang Sun- hong |} ==Statistics== ===Goalscorers=== A total of 31 goals were scored by 24 different players.
