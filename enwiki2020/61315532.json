She had been pretending to suffer from a brain tumor and was accused of using the illness and her position as a sports coach to engage in a relationship with a 15-year old girl. Nokes had been employed at a school in Port Talbot when she met the pupil who was 13 at the time. Nokes claimed that she was suffering from a terminal brain tumor, shaved her head and faked seizures to trick people. The pupil later informed police that Nokes had \"manipulated\" her into a relationship. A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service later commented \"Nokes hid behind her reputation as an accomplished sportswoman and abused the position of trust . . . to manipulate the victim and fulfil her own sexual gratification.\" Nokes was placed on the sex offenders register for life and was also issued a restraining order against contacting the victim. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Port Talbot Category:Welsh women's footballers Category:Wales women's international footballers Category:Welsh female rugby union players Category:Welsh sex offenders Category:Cardiff City Ladies F.C. players Category:FA Women's National League players Category:Women's association football goalkeepers ",
