After the conquest the area became part of the encomienda system which lasted until the end of the colonial era. Yucat\u00e1n declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the area was assigned to the Valladolid region. During the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n, the village was sacked by the rebel indigenous people and the 300 white inhabitants fled. Colonel Eulogio Rosado y Estev\u00e9z established a headquarters in 1848, 25 miles away in the town of Ichmul, to try to recover Chikindzonot. In 1849, Lt. Col. Pablo A. Gonz\u00e1lez y Osorio was able to retake the town, and thereafter it slowly repopulated. It was designated as its own municipality in 1957. ==Governance== The municipal president is elected for a three-year term. The town council has seven councilpersons, who serve as Secretary and councilors of public security, public sanitation and monuments. ==Communities== The head of the municipality is Chikindzonot, Yucat\u00e1n. The other populated areas of the municipality include Chan-Chimil\u00e1, Chan Santa Mar\u00eda e Ichmul; Chax\u00e1n, Ichmul, San Crist\u00f3bal, San Jos\u00e9, Xarco, X-Campana, X-Kancabdzonot, Xkante\u00edl, Xoax Dzonot, Xpoxil, Yokdzonot Carrillo, and Yokdzonot Viejo.
