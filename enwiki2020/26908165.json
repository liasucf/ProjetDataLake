    "text": "Thomas William Bradshaw (born 27 July 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Championship club Millwall. He has previously played for Aberystwyth Town, Shrewsbury Town, Walsall and Barnsley. Born in England, he represented Wales at under\u221219 and under\u221221 level before making his senior Wales debut in March 2016. ==Club career== ===Shrewsbury Town=== Bradshaw started his career at Aberystwyth Town and was signed by Shrewsbury Town in May 2009 (Aberystwyth later received a retrospective fee of \u00a330,000 under the FIFA training compensation scheme). He made his debut in a League Two match against Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road on 10 April 2010, replacing Jamie Cureton for the final 15 minutes and scoring two goals in a 3\u20130 win. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season he signed a two-year professional contract. Despite scoring six goals in the 2010\u201311 season, Bradshaw found first team opportunities more limited in 2011\u201312, making only 8 appearances and scoring once against Accrington Stanley. Bradshaw was handed the number nine shirt for the 2012\u201313 campaign, in which he made 22 appearances, mostly as a substitute, but failed to score. He signed a contract extension of an undisclosed length on 23 May 2013 and scored his first senior goal for nearly two years in a 2\u20130 home win over Swindon Town on 17 August. ===Walsall=== On 23 June 2014, Bradshaw signed a two-year contract with League One side Walsall for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of \u00a350,000, following the relegation of Shrewsbury Town to League Two. He scored his first goal for the Saddlers on his debut for the club on 9 August 2014 against Port Vale in a 1\u20131 away draw. Bradshaw injured his hamstring in a 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City on 4 October 2014, which sidelined him for most of the month. He also scored a last\u2013minute equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw against his former side Shrewsbury in the FA Cup first round on 8 November 2014. Bradshaw enjoyed a prolific start to the season and scored his tenth goal of the campaign in all competitions in a 3\u20131 win against Barnsley on 13 December 2014. Bradshaw scored Walsall's second goal in their 2\u20130 victory over Preston North End in the first leg of the Football League Trophy Northern area final on 7 January 2015. He started in the final on 22 March, Walsall's first match at Wembley Stadium, a 0\u20132 defeat to Bristol City. On 24 June, he extended his contract until the end of the 2016\u201317 season. Bradshaw scored his first career hat-trick on 11 August 2015 in a 4\u20133 win at Championship side Nottingham Forest in the first round of the League Cup, finishing with an added-time penalty. After making his international debut for Wales, and Walsall subsequently losing to Barnsley in the League One play-off semi-final, Bradshaw requested to be placed on the transfer list in July 2016. ===Barnsley=== After his transfer request was accepted by the Saddlers, Bradshaw joined newly promoted Championship club Barnsley for an undisclosed fee on 14 July. He scored his first goal for the Reds in a 4\u20130 win against Rotherham United on 27 August 2016. He scored eight times in his first season and in 2017\u201318 he was the club's top scorer with 12 goals, as they were relegated. On 7 April 2018, he scored a later winner in a 3\u20132 win over South Yorkshire rivals at Sheffield United at Oakwell; it was only his club's second win in 14 games. ===Millwall=== On 23 August 2018, Bradshaw joined Millwall initially on loan until January, when the deal became permanent. His season ended in November after ten goalless appearances, with a knee ligament injury against Brentford. ==International career== Although he was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Bradshaw grew up in Tywyn, Gwynedd, and attended Ysgol Penglais School in Aberystwyth, thus qualified to play for Wales. He was called up to the Wales under\u221219 squad for the first time in September 2010, scoring on his debut during a 2\u20130 win over Liechtenstein. He scored again in a 3\u20133 draw with Turkey on 20 October 2010. He was called into the Wales under\u221221 squad in September 2011 for the away game with Montenegro, scoring on his debut. Bradshaw was capped eight times for the Wales U\u221221 squad, making his last appearance as a substitute against Moldova U\u221221s on 10 September 2013. He opted to withdraw from the squad when called up a month later in order to remain available for first-team duties with Shrewsbury Town. This effectively ended his international youth career, with under\u221221s manager Geraint Williams indicating he would not select him again, although Bradshaw was in any case in his last few months of eligibility for the under\u221221 squad. A year later, Bradshaw was put on the standby list for the senior Wales national football team for the Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Bosnia & Herzegovina and Cyprus in October 2014, but had to withdraw due to picking up a hamstring injury in a match against Bristol City for new club Walsall. On 4 November 2015 he was called up to the senior squad for a friendly against the Netherlands, and was an unused substitute in a 3\u20132 defeat. He made his debut the following 28 March, replacing Tom Lawrence for the final 17 minutes of a 1\u20130 friendly loss to Ukraine in Kiev. Bradshaw was in Chris Coleman's provisional squad for the final tournament, but withdrew due to a calf injury. ==Honors== Wales *China Cup runner-up: 2018 ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Aberystwyth Town |2008\u201309 |Welsh Premier League |4||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||2 |- |rowspan=6|Shrewsbury Town |2009\u201310 |League Two |6||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||3 |- |2010\u201311 |League Two |26||6||0||0||1||0||3||0||30||6 |- |2011\u201312 |League Two |8||1||0||0||1||0||1||0||10||1 |- |2012\u201313 |League One |21||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||22||0 |- |2013\u201314 |League One |28||7||1||0||1||0||0||0||30||7 |- !colspan=2|Shrewsbury Town Total !89||17||1||0||4||0||4||0||98||17 |- |rowspan=3|Walsall |2014\u201315 |League One |29||17||1||2||2||0||5||1||37||20 |- |2015\u201316 |League One |41||17||3||0||2||3||3||0||49||20 |- !colspan=2|Walsall Total !70||34||4||2||4||3||8||1||86||40 |- |rowspan=4|Barnsley |2016\u201317 |Championship |42||8||2||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||45||8 |- |2017\u201318 |Championship |39||9||1||0||3||3||colspan=2|\u2014||43||12 |- |2018\u201319 |League One |4||1||0||0||1||0||0||0||5||1 |- !colspan=2|Barnsley Total !85||18||3||0||5||3||0||0||93||21 |- |Millwall (loan) |2018\u201319 |Championship |10||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||10||0 |- |rowspan=2|Millwall |2019\u201320 |Championship |45||8||2||1||1||1||colspan=2|\u2014||48||10 |- !colspan=2|Millwall Total !55||8||2||1||1||1||colspan=2|\u2014||58||10 |- !colspan=3|Career total !303||79||10||3||14||7||12||1||339||90 |} ==References== ==External links== *Tom Bradshaw profile at the Shrewsbury Town website *Tom Bradshaw Welsh Premier League career stats * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Shrewsbury Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales youth international footballers Category:Wales under-21 international footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Aberystwyth Town F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:English Football League players Category:People educated at Ysgol Penglais School Category:Welsh people of English descent ",
