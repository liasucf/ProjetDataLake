    "text": "Babylon and On is the seventh album released in 1987 by the British new wave group Squeeze. ==History== Eric \"ET\" Thorngren produced the album, along with Glenn Tilbrook. The group officially expanded to a sextet with the addition of former Soft Boys member Andy Metcalfe; a bassist in that group, here Metcalfe was used as a second keyboard player (behind Jools Holland). However, despite being pictured and billed as a full member of the band, the track-by-track musician listings included with this album reveal that Metcalfe only played on three songs: \"Tough Love\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"Some Americans\". Metcalfe left Squeeze before their next album was recorded, although he worked again with Glenn Tilbrook during his solo years. The album peaked at number 14 in the UK Albums Chart, the highest ranking there for a Squeeze album, aside from greatest hits compilations, until Cradle to the Grave (2015) reached number 12. The album was released in September 1987 and gave them their biggest US hit single, \"Hourglass.\" The song became an unexpected US hit for the band, reaching number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, which Chris Difford attributed to the video for the song as much as the song itself: \"I would think that the video has had a lot to do with it. It\u2019s been played a lot, and everybody you speak to compliments you on it. When you meet fans after gigs, they say, \u201cYour video\u2019s great.\u201d They don\u2019t say, \u201cYour album\u2019s great.\u201d So it\u2019s the first thing they think of.\"Bud Scoppa with Darryl Morden Music Connection, 25 January 1988 A second song released in the US later in the year, \"853-5937\", also landed at number 32 on the US Hot 100. ==Track listing== All songs written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook. # \"Hourglass\" \u2013 3:16 # \"Footprints\" \u2013 3:49 # \"Tough Love\" \u2013 3:07 # \"The Prisoner\" \u2013 4:06 # \"853-5937\" \u2013 3:16 # \"In Today's Room\" \u2013 3:28 # \"Trust Me to Open My Mouth\" \u2013 3:12 # \"Striking Matches\" \u2013 3:02 # \"Cigarette of a Single Man\" \u2013 3:29 # \"Who Are You?\" \u2013 3:30 # \"The Waiting Game\" \u2013 3:06 # \"Some Americans\" \u2013 4:40 ===Bonus tracks on UK CD version=== # * \"Splitting into Three\" \u2013 3:35 # \"Wedding Bells\" \u2013 2:21 ===Bonus tracks on Japanese CD version=== # * \"Wedding Bells\" \u2013 2:21 # \"Take Me I'm Yours (Live)\" \u2013 4:04 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1987) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|84 |- |United Kingdom (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|14 |} ==Personnel== ;Squeeze *Chris Difford \u2013 guitar, backing vocals, lead vocal on 8, co-lead vocal on 3 *Glenn Tilbrook \u2013 guitars, keyboards, horns, sitar, lead & backing vocals *Jools Holland \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals *Andy Metcalfe \u2013 keyboards (moog, horns, etc.) on 3, 4, 12 *Keith Wilkinson \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Gilson Lavis \u2013 drums, percussion with: *T-Bone Wolk \u2013 accordion on 3, 8, 12 *Monique Dyan \u2013 backing vocals on 4, 5, 6, 10; duet vocals on 8 *Pam Baker, Mike Sheerie, Stewart Dunning \u2013 mob vocal on 8 *Del Newman \u2013 string arrangement and conducting on 11 ==References== ==External links== * Album summary Category:Squeeze (band) albums Category:1987 albums Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Albums produced by Glenn Tilbrook ",
