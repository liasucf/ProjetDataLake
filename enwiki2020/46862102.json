Varnam has been credited with bringing modern aesthetic sensibilities and design philosophies to a traditional craft.

My attempt has been to bring my own aesthetic sensibilities and design philosophy to traditional crafts. The idea is to reorient our crafts to the modern context by ensuring that each design has a utilitarian value and thereby relevant today.\u201d Varnam products often double as creative games and puzzles. The packaging is also often accompanied by a note about the animals and traditional motifs used in the design of Varnam products.
