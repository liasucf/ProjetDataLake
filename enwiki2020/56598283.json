    "text": "Carolyn Moxley Rouse (born c. 1965) is an American anthropologist, professor and filmmaker. She is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology at Princeton University. ==Biography== Rouse grew up in Del Mar, California, the daughter of a physicist (her father) and a psychologist (her mother). She encountered discrimination at an early age as her family was prevented from buying a home in Rancho Sante Fe because of their race. Rouse attended Swarthmore College, graduating in 1987. In her junior year, she studied abroad in Kenya in a program focused on wildlife biology, but found she was much more interested in the people around her, which prompted a turn toward documentary film, then eventually a master's in visual anthropology and a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Southern California. Rouse's siblings are both academics; her brother is a professor of physics and her sister, Cecilia Rouse, is the dean of Princeton\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Rouse's brother-in-law (Cecilia's husband) is Ford Morrison, son of Nobel Prize-winning author and Princeton professor emeritus Toni Morrison. ==Bibliography== * Engaged Surrender: African American Women and Islam (University of California Press, 2004) * Uncertain Suffering: Racial Healthcare Disparities and Sickle Cell Disease (University of California Press, 2009) * Televised Redemption: Black Religious Media and Racial Empowerment with John L.
