    "text": "Charles Schroeter (July 4, 1837 \u2013 January 27, 1921) was a United States Army soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the American Indian Wars, while serving with Company G, 8th Regiment of the United States Cavalry. A German immigrant, his military career spanned thirty-one years, from 1863 to 1894, during which he also saw action in the American Civil War. He also served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps. After retirement from the military, he became a merchant. ==Biography== While listed repeatedly as being born in Lindberg (which is in Bavaria) and also Hanover both in present-day Germany, it is more likely he was born in L\u00fcneburg in the Kingdom of Hanover in 1837. \"L\u00fcneburg\" is pronounced \"L\u00fcmborg\" in Low German and influenced by the Germanic umlaut or linguistic mark. English speakers may have heard and written it as \"Lindberg\" or \"Lindbergh\". Later records cite July 4, 1837, as his birthday. His parents' names are unknown. Charles Schroeter came to America in 1860 on the German passenger ship Bremen. The ship had picked up passengers at Hanover and Bremen, in Germany, before arriving in New York City on November 12, 1860. He was listed as a merchant. The ship then proceeded to New Orleans.

After his service in the Civil War and his career in the military, he opened \"a retail confectionery and cigar store\" with \"E.L. Hoopes\" after moving to Buffalo, New York, in 1894. He was cited in an 1898 Erie County biography as \"a successful and prominent citizen, with a long and honorable career, his worth has been duly recognized.\" Page 141-142. He was noted about 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighed 135 lb, with light brown eyes, black hair, and a fair complexion. His military records vary from 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet inches in height. His eye color varies from hazel, to light brown in those same records. His complexion was always listed as fair or ruddy. The variations in the records are not uncommon in the 1800s since each individual officer processing the enlistment had no standard manner, place, light or equipment to make accurate measurement.

He fought Cochise and the Chiricahua Apaches during a battle at Rocky Mesa in the Chiricahua Mountains on October 20, 1869, earning the Medal of Honor for Gallantry in Action. This engagement was caused by an earlier attack (October 5) on a stagecoach that killed two civilians and four soldiers traveling as passengers to Tucson, Arizona and an attack on a group of cowboys in the Sulphur Springs Valley by Apache Indians.McChristian, Douglas C.

Above and Beyond: A History of the Medal of Honor from the Civil War to Vietnam. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1985. (pg. 325) U.S. Medal of Honor version given from 1862 to 1895 A detachment of 66 men of the 1st Cavalry Regiment and 61 men of Company G under Lieutenant John Lafferty of the 8th Cavalry had tracked the Apaches into the Chiricahua Mountains and eventually to an engagement what some called the \"Campaign of the Rocky Mesa.\" The combined troops were led by Captain Reuben F. Bernard of the 1st Cavalry. The cool overcast day became \"a miserable day, cold with rain and hail, when the cavalrymen attacked.\" The Apaches were well entrenched and defending behind rocks and boulders near the top of a ridge. The soldiers had to climb a defile or a steep-sided and narrow passage of loose slick rocks to go over and around as they moved up toward the top of the mesa. More than one fell due to the weather conditions. Under these deplorable conditions Schroeter and his fellow soldiers advanced upwards toward the hostile Indians. Captain Bernard noted in his report: \"These men are they who advanced with me up the steep and rocky mesa under as heavy a fire as I ever saw delivered from the number of men, Indians, say from one hundred to two hundred. These men advanced under this fire until within thirty steps from the Indians when they came to a ledge of rocks where every man who showed his head was shot at by several Indians at once. Here the men remained and did good shooting through the crevices of the rocks until ordered to fall back which was done by running from rock to rock where they would halt and return the fire of the Indians.\"O'Neal, Bill.

Stillwater, Oklahoma: Barbed Wire Press, 1991. (pg. 26) Yenne, Bill. Indian Wars: The Campaign for the American West. Yardley, Pennsylvania: Westholme Publishing, 2006. (pg. 141) As darkness fell, Schroeter with other cavalrymen were ordered to withdraw. They did so in good order individually and in small groups taking their wounded with them down the dangerous slick slopes under enemy fire. Some would provide covering fire while others retreated a short distance, then the process would repeat. Schroeter's commanding officer, Lt. Lafferty, in trying to recover dead soldiers was shot in the mouth destroying his lower left jaw. The entire action cost a likely overestimated 15 to 18 Apache lives and two confirmed soldiers dead with about 4 or 5 (accounts differ) wounded troopers. Schroeter completed his first tour of duty as a private with F Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment on August 9, 1871, while at Fort Selden in New Mexico. ===1871\u20131876=== He was reenlisted by Captain Brown on October 7, 1871, at St. Louis, Missouri as a soldier. He is listed as being born at Hanover, Germany, now age 34. He description was noted as Hazel eyes, black hair and fair complexion with his height as 5 feet inches. The 1st Infantry Regiment campaigned against the Sioux in the 1870s while Schroeter was with them. He completed his second enlistment as a sergeant with C Company, 1st Infantry Regiment, while stationed at Fort Sully, Dakota Territory on October 7, 1876. His character was listed as \"excellent.\" Source Information: Ancestry.com. U.S. Army, Register of Enlistments, 1798\u20131914 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc., 2007.

USS Alliance at anchor. Schroeter traveled to Washington, D.C., and on November 2, 1877, he was sworn into the United States Marine Corps. Private Schroeter reported aboard USS Alliance in March 1877. He was one of the 26 Marines aboard that screw gunboat. Deployed in Mediterranean Schroeter with his shipmates called at many ship ports for the next three years. Corporal Schroeter was discharged from the Marine Corps on November 2, 1881.At the same general time period, another \"Charles Schroeter\" joined the U.S. Army on May 27, 1878, while in New York City, New York. The information entered by Capt. Cheffield, shows his birth as in Saxony, Germany, Age 38, a merchant, with blue eyes, dark hair, ruddy complexion, and being 5 feet 3 inches high. This Charles Schroeter deserted on November 8, 1878, while at Jefferson Barracks. It appears the Schroeter of this article was a victim of identity theft. When Marine Private Schroeter went aboard the USS Alliance, she was a new ship built in 1875. She had been commissioned on January 18, 1877, with Commander Theodore F. Kane as captain. On March 9 she sailed to join the European Squadron with the mission of protecting American lives and property, and showing the American flag. The Alliance was based at Ville-franche, France, where, with the permission of the French Government, the United States maintained a supply depot. Soon after arrival in Europe, the Russo-Turkish War broke out, and Schroeter and his fellow ship mates were sent to Salonika, on the Greek coast, and thence to Smyrna. The duty was tedious and boring and discipline was maintained through a strict training regime. Close order drills, abandon ship drills, fire drills, repel boarder drills and cleaning and repairs occupied most of Schroeter's time over the next ten months. \"Spit and polish\" was often the mantra aboard such US Navy ships. USS Franklin In February 1878, the Alliance became Rear Admiral William E. Le Roy's flagship. The Alliance then sailed for Piraeus in Greece, the port for Athens. During ex-President Grant's stay in Greece the Alliance \"rendered honors\" to him on March 13. A few weeks later while at Piraeus, the ship received the King and Queen of Greece. They \"remained a considerable time on board\" aboard the Alliance which was the flagship for the US Navy flotilla. The King and Queen on their departure were \"honored with the usual ceremonies as upon their arrival\" on March 26. Whether Schroeter and his fellow Marines were impressed by such honored company is open to debate. The Alliance sailed from the Eastern Mediterranean to beyond the Western end into Algiers and back to Villefranche visiting ports along the way. She then repeated the process and such was the routine until late 1879. She reached Boston on December 8, 1879, then sailed for Norfolk the following day, arriving there on the 14th. For the next five months, the ship lay under repairs at Norfolk. Schroeter and the other Marines were sent ashore for other duties. Schroeter became a hospital guard until being assigned to the USRS Franklin. The Franklin had been a Civil War screw frigate until retired from active service on March 2, 1877. She was then recommissioned as a receiving ship, which was also known as a \"barracks ship.\" He was transferred to the Marine Barracks in Norfolk on October 24, 1881, where he was honorably discharged November 4, 1881, from the USMC.

His will stated he wished his remains to be cremated and then interred locally under a pre-paid burial policy. A local Masonic Lodge (#35) held a memorial ceremony for him and placed a small obituary notice in the San Diego Union newspaper. No family members were found during a lengthy probate search conducted by the City that was closed in 1931, ten years after his death. More than a decade after his death, his remains were still not claimed. His cremains were placed in an unmarked pauper crypt with other unclaimed remains at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego. About 2005, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, whose members are Medal of Honor holders, tasked its Foundation to find the graves of several hundred missing Medal of Honor recipients. The mission of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation is to promote the Medal of Honor legacy, values and what it stands for. Laura Jowdy, an archivist with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, conducted the primary research on Schroeter. As did the Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the United States under Don Morfe. Jowdy is quoted as saying, about Schroeter and other missing Medal of Honor dead, \"It's important for these brave individuals not to be forgotten.\" Her research with the CMOHS on his service led the investigation to San Diego in 2010. Captain Bill Heard, USNR retired, the Miramar National Cemetery Support Foundation's Public Information Officer, with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, conducted local research for the unmarked burial location. With assistance of the San Diego History Center archivist, Jane Kenealy, Schroeter's remains were found in an unmarked crypt at Greenwood Memorial Park. Don Morfe of the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States provided a \"commemorative plaque to mark the location of the remains\". Heard was then instrumental in convincing the National Cemetery Administration that the Charles G. Schroeter who died in 1921 was the same Charles Schroeter who received the Medal of Honor in 1870 for his actions in 1869. In 2013, that Foundation sent a Medal of Honor plaque to the cemetery for placement with his remains. Cemetery staff were unaware of they had a Medal of Honor recipient until that point of time. Following receipt of the plaque, Cathy Fiorelli, director of Greenwood Memorial Park who also serves on the board of the Miramar cemetery's foundation, decided that Schroeter should be buried at a national cemetery as it seemed \"...more befitting, proper and appropriate as the final resting place for a war veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.\" Miramar National Cemetery Foundation Director Charles Bailey submitted the first request to transfer the remains of Charles Schroeter. After providing more details and facts, the second formal request by Bailey was successfully submitted. Fiorelli then filed a request to transfer the remains to Miramar National Cemetery, which was approved. On July 8, 2015, Schroeter's remains were escorted from Greenwood Memorial Park to the new (dedicated 2010) Miramar National Cemetery by Patriot Guard Riders. The following day, July 9, 2015, a somber military ceremony took place as Schroeter was reburied with full military honors. A horse-drawn hearse carried his remains with an honor guard of thirty soldiers from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Irwin, California. Also present were flag bearing Patriot Guard Riders, two living Medal of Honor recipients, Civil War re- enactors, and an Army band with a few military and cemetery officials providing their respects.
