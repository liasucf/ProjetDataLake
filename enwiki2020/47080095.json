    "text": "The Krokettenmotie (croquette motion) is a motion proposed on 25 November 1993 by former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Jan Peter Balkenende, in the municipal council of Amstelveen. The motion called for the right of members of the municipal council to a croquette if a council meeting lasts until after 23:00. It was meant as a joke, but because the other parties agreed, the motion was adopted and is still in force. In 2002, a similar motion came into force in Zwolle. It was decided that if a council meeting lasts until after 22:00, a croquette or similar snack should be served to the members of the council. Vegetarian snacks were also mentioned in this new rule.Krokettenmotie.
