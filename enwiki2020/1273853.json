The magazine is associated with the realist school of foreign policy thought. It was founded in 1985 by Irving Kristol and until 2001 was edited by Australian academic Owen Harries. == History == Founded in 1985 by American columnist and neoconservatism advocate Irving Kristol, the magazine was until 2001 edited by Australian academic Owen Harries. In 2001, The National Interest was acquired by The Center for the National Interest, a public policy think tank based in Washington D.C. that was established by former U.S. President Richard Nixon on January 20, 1994 as the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom.The Nixon Center: Mission statement Nixon's handpicked executive and current president, Dimitri Simes, was named in the Mueller Report as one of the \u201clinks\u201d between Donald Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 103: \"Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest.\" In 2005, ten editors of The National Interest resigned due to different viewpoints regarding the magazines acquisition and with the larger editorial board. Those who left founded a separate journal, The American Interest. == Influence and reception == The National Interest is credited with introducing ideas like \"the West and the rest\" and geoeconomics into public discourse. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama formulated his early political and philosophical thoughts on the end of history at the journal, which argued that the worldwide spread of liberal democracies and free-market capitalism of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. Writing in Politico, journalist James Kirchick argued in 2016 while commenting on Donald Trump's Russian relationships that The National Interest and its parent company \"are two of the most Kremlin-sympathetic institutions in the nation\u2019s capital, even more so that the Carnegie Moscow Center.\" In July 2015, the magazine published an article by Maria Butina advocating improved relations between the Russian Federation and a future US Republican presidential administration. In 2018, Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent. ==See also== * The American Interest, founded in 2005 by former members of the TNI editorial board * National Affairs * Coalition for a Realistic Foreign Policy * Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections ==References== ==External links== * Category:1985 establishments in Washington, D.C.
