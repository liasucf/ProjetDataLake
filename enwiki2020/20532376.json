    "text": "Caio da Silva Prado J\u00fanior (February 11, 1907 \u2013 November 23, 1990) was a Brazilian historian, geographer, writer, philosopher and politician. His works inaugurated a new historiographic tradition in Brazil, identified with Marxism, which led to new interpretations of the Brazilian colonial society. == Biography == Caio Prado graduated with a degree in law from Faculdade do Largo de S\u00e3o Francisco, S\u00e3o Paulo in 1928, where he would later become a Professor of Political Economy. He was politically active during the 1930s and 1940s, including during the 1930 Revolution. In 1933, he published his first work - Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica do Brasil (Political Evolution of Brazil) - an attempt to understand the country's political and social history. In 1934 he took part in the foundation of Brazilian Geographers Association. After a trip to the Soviet Union, at the time under Stalin's dictatorship, he published URSS - um novo mundo (Soviet Union - a New World), which was banned by Get\u00falio Vargas' government's censorship. He then joined the Alian\u00e7a Nacional Libertadora which he chaired in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1942 he published the classic Forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Brasil Contempor\u00e2neo - Col\u00f4nia (Formation of Contemporary Brazil - Colony) , which should have been the first part of a work on Brazilian historic evolution. However, the following volumes were never written. In 1945 he was elected deputado estadual for the Brazilian Communist Party. He published the newspaper A Plat\u00e9ia and, in 1943, with Arthur Neves and Monteiro Lobato, he founded Editora Brasiliense (Brasiliense Publishing House), for which, later, he published Revista Brasiliense, between 1956 and 1964. After 1964, he was persecuted by the military dictatorship. In 1966 he was elected Intellectual of the Year by the Uni\u00e3o Brasileira de Escritores, following the publication of A revolu\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira (Brazilian Revolution). ==Works== The most important works of Caio Prado Junior are: * 1933: Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica do Brasil * 1934: URSS - um novo mundo * 1942: Forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Brasil Contempor\u00e2neo (translated as The colonial background of modern Brazil Berkeley : University of California Press, 1967) * 1945: Hist\u00f3ria Econ\u00f4mica do Brasil Access here * 1952: Dial\u00e9tica do Conhecimento * 1953: Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica do Brasil e Outros Estudos * 1954: Diretrizes para uma Pol\u00edtica Econ\u00f4mica Brasileira * 1957: Esbo\u00e7o de Fundamentos da Teoria Econ\u00f4mica * 1959: Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 L\u00f3gica Dial\u00e9tica (Notas Introdut\u00f3rias) * 1962: O Mundo do Socialismo * 1966: A Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira * 1971: Estruturalismo de L\u00e9vi-Strauss - O Marxismo de Louis Althusser * 1972: Hist\u00f3ria e Desenvolvimento * 1979: A Quest\u00e3o Agr\u00e1ria no Brasil * 1980: O que \u00e9 Liberdade * 1981: O que \u00e9 Filosofia * 1983: A Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo == External links == *Economic history of Brazil, author Caio Prado Junior, in Portuguese ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1990 deaths Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Brazilian historians Category:Brazilian Marxists Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo alumni Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo faculty Category:Brazilian geographers Category:Brazilian philosophers Category:20th-century historians Category:Marxist historians Category:20th-century geographers Category:20th- century philosophers ",
