    "text": "Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (16 April 1886 \u2013 18 August 1944) was a German communist politician, and leader of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) from 1925 to 1933. A committed Stalinist, Th\u00e4lmann played a major role during the political instability of the Weimar Republic, especially in its final years, when the KPD explicitly sought to overthrow the liberal democracy of the republic. Under his leadership the KPD became intimately associated with the government of the Soviet Union and the policies of Joseph Stalin, and from 1928 the party was largely controlled and funded by Stalin's government. The KPD under Th\u00e4lmann's leadership regarded the Social Democratic Party (SPD) as its main adversary and the party adopted the position that the social democrats were \"social fascists.\" Th\u00e4lmann was also leader of the paramilitary Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund (which was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats in 1929). In 1932 he established Antifaschistische Aktion or Antifa, which concentrated its attacks on the recently formed social democratic paramilitary organization Iron Front. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1933 and held in solitary confinement for eleven years; for political reasons, Stalin did not seek his release when he entered into the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, and Th\u00e4lmann's party rival Walter Ulbricht ignored requests to plead on his behalf. Many of Th\u00e4lmann's closest associates who had emigrated to the Soviet Union were executed during the Great Purge of the 1930s. Th\u00e4lmann was shot on Adolf Hitler's personal orders in Buchenwald in 1944.Ernst Th\u00e4lmann biography at Spartacus educational == Family and early years == Ernst Th\u00e4lmann's parents, Johannes Th\u00e4lmann (called 'Jan'; 11 April 1857, Weddern (Holstein \u2013 31 October 1933), a farmworker, and Mary-Magdalene (n\u00e9e Kohpeiss; 8 November 1857, Kirchwerder \u2013 9 March 1927) married in 1884 in Hamburg. Ernst's parents had no party affiliation; in contrast to his father, his mother was deeply religious. After Ernst's birth, his parents took over a pub near the Port of Hamburg. On 4 April 1887, his sister Frieda was born (died 8 July 1967 in Hamburg). In March 1892, Th\u00e4lmann's parents were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison, because they had fenced stolen goods or had taken them for debt payment.Hamburgischer Correspondent und Hamburgische B\u00f6rsen-Halle, Morgenausgabe, 5. M\u00e4rz 1892. Ernst and Frieda were placed in separate foster families. Th\u00e4lmann's parents were released early; his mother in May, and his father in October 1893. His parents' offense was used 36 years later in the campaign against Ernst Th\u00e4lmann. From 1893 to 1900, Th\u00e4lmann attended elementary school. He later described history, natural history, folklore, mathematics, gymnastics and sports as his favorite subjects. However, he did not like religion. In the mid-1890s, his parents opened a vegetable, coal and wagon shop in Eilbek,Ernst Th\u00e4lmann: Gek\u00fcrzter Lebenslauf, aus dem Stegreif niedergelegt, stilistisch deshalb nicht ganz einwandfrei. 1935, In: Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus beim ZK der SED (Hrsg.): Ernst Th\u00e4lmann: Briefe \u2013 Erinnerungen. Dietz Verlag, Berlin 1986. a suburb of Hamburg. The young Ernst worked in the business after school and did his schoolwork in the morning before classes started. Despite this burden, Th\u00e4lmann was a good student who enjoyed learning. He wanted to become a teacher or to learn a trade, but his parents refused to lend him financial support. He had to continue working in his parents' business, causing much sorrow and conflict with his parents. Therefore, he sought a job as an unskilled worker in the port. Here the ten-year-old Th\u00e4lmann came in contact with the port workers on strike from November 1896 till February 1897 in the bitter labor dispute known as the Hamburg Docker's Strike 1896/97.Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus beim Zentralkomitee der SED (Autorenkollektiv): Ernst Th\u00e4lmann. Eine Biographie. Dietz, Berlin 1980. == Leaving home; World War I; desertion == At the beginning of 1902, he left home. He first he lived in an emergency shelter, later in a basement apartment, and in 1904 he was fireman on the steam-powered freight ship AMERIKA which also traveled to the USA. He was a Social Democratic Party member during 1903. On 1 February 1904, he joined the Central Union of Trade, transport and traffic workers of Germany and ascended to the chairman of the 'Department carters'. In 1913, he supported a call of Rosa Luxemburg for a mass strike as a means of action of the SPD to enforce political demands. From 1913 to 1914, he worked for a laundry as a coachman. In January 1915, one day before he was called up for military service in World War I, he married Rosa Koch. He was posted to the artillery on the western front, where he stayed till the end of the war, on personal account taking part in the Battle of Champagne (1915\u20131916), the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Battle of Arras (1917), the Second Battle of the Aisne (1917), the Battle of Cambrai (1917) (1917), and the Battle of Soissons (1918). For his service, Th\u00e4lmann received the Iron cross Second Class, the Hanseatic Cross and Wound Badge (twice). Towards the end of 1917, he became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). In late October 1918, while on home leave from the front, Th\u00e4lmann deserted together with four fellow soldiers. On 9 November 1918, he wrote in his diary on the Western Front, \"...did a bunk from the Front with 4 comrades at 2 o'clock.\"Branko Lazitch and Milorad Drachkovitch, \"Ernst Th\u00e4lmann\" in Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, Palo Alto: Hoover Institution Press, 1986 == Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD) == Ernst Th\u00e4lmann on the front page of a KPD newspaper, the Saxon Workers' News, during the 1925 presidential election. The caption reads \"Ernst Th\u00e4lmann: the Red President!\" After his desertion, he was active in the German Revolution in Hamburg that began on 29th October 1918. From March 1919, he was chairman of the USPD in Hamburg, a member of the Hamburg Parliament, and worked as a relief worker in the Hamburg city park before taking up a well-paying job at the employment office. There, he rose to the rank of Inspector. When the USPD split over the question whether to join the Communist International (Comintern), Th\u00e4lmann sided with the pro-Communist faction which merged with the KPD in November 1920, and in the following December Th\u00e4lmann was elected to the KPD's Central Committee. In March 1921 he was fired from his job at the employment office due to his political activities. That summer Th\u00e4lmann was a representative of the KPD to the Congress of the Comintern in Moscow and met Vladimir Lenin personally.Norman LaPorte: The Rise of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann and the Hamburg Left 1921-1923, in: Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart 2017, pp. 131. In June 1922, terrorists from the ultranationalist group Organisation Consul threw a hand grenade into his ground floor flat, but the assassination attempt failed and he survived. Th\u00e4lmann helped to organise the Hamburg Uprising of October 1923Timeline of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann's life (in German), at the Lebendiges Museum Online (LEMO): https://www.dhm.de/lemo/biografie/ernst-thaelmann \\-- it failed, however, and Th\u00e4lmann was forced to go in hiding. After Lenin's death in late January 1924, Th\u00e4lmann visited Moscow and maintained a guard of honour at his bier. From February 1924 he was deputy chairman of the KPD and, from May, a Reichstag member. At the 5th Congress of the Comintern in July 1924 he was elected to the Comintern executive committee and a short time later to its steering committee. In February 1925 he became chairman of the KPD's paramilitary organisation, the Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund (RFB) (although this organisation was banned as an extremist organisation by the governing social democrats in 1929, after the events of Blutmai (\"Bloody May\", see below)). In October 1925 Th\u00e4lmann became chairman of the KPD and thus a candidate for the German Presidency. Th\u00e4lmann's candidacy in the second round of the presidential election split the centre-left vote, ensuring that the conservative Paul von Hindenburg defeated the Centre Party's Wilhelm Marx.David Priestand, Red Flag: A History of Communism, New York: Grove Press, 2009 In October 1926 Th\u00e4lmann supported the dockers' strike in his home town of Hamburg. He saw this as an act of solidarity with the British miners' strike which had started on 1 May, although that strike had been profitable for the Hamburg Docks as an alternative supplier of coal. In 1928 during the Wittorf affair he was ousted from the party central committee for trying to cover up embezzlement by John Wittorf, a party official and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (and a close friend) of Th\u00e4lmann. However, Stalin intervened and had Th\u00e4lmann reinstated, signalling the beginning of a purge and completing the \"Stalinization\" of the KPD.Eric D. Weitz, Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997 === KPD vs. SPD === Ernst Th\u00e4lmann statue in Weimar Th\u00e4lmann, Ernst and Thorez, Maurice \u2013 Paris-Berlin, 1932 During World War I and the Weimar Republic, the KPD competed for leadership of the working class with the more moderate Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), particularly after the latter supported German involvement in the War. At the 12th party congress of the KPD in June 1929 in Berlin-Wedding, Th\u00e4lmann adopted a policy of confrontation with the SPD. This followed the events of \"Bloody May\", in which 32 people were killed by the police in an attempt to suppress demonstrations which had been banned by the Interior Minister, Carl Severing, a Social Democrat. Th\u00e4lmann's KPD thus fought the SPD as its main political enemy, acting according to the Comintern policy which declared Social Democrats to be \"social fascists\". This made it difficult for the two leftist parties to work together against the emergence of Adolf Hitler.David Priestand, Red Flag: A History of Communism',' New York: Grove Press, 2009 The KPD under Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"fighting fascism means fighting the SPD just as much as it means fighting Hitler and the parties of Br\u00fcning.\" Th\u00e4lmann declared in December 1931 that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest\" of social democrats. By 1927, Karl Kilbom, the Comintern representative to Germany, had started to combat this ultra-leftist tendency within the German Communist Party, but found Stalin machinating against his efforts. In March 1932, Th\u00e4lmann was once again a candidate for the German Presidency, against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler. The KPD's slogan was \"A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war.\" Th\u00e4lmann returned as a candidate in the second round of the election, as it was permitted by the German electoral law, but his vote count lessened from 4,983,000 (13.2%), in the first round, to 3,707,000 (10.2%). After the National Socialists came to power in January 1933, Th\u00e4lmann proposed, to no avail, that the SPD and KPD should organise a general strike to topple National Socialist rule together. In February 1933, a Central Committee meeting of the then already banned KPD took place at the \"Sporthaus Ziegenhals\" in K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen, near Berlin, where Th\u00e4lmann had called for the violent overthrow of Hitler's government. (The Comintern's guidelines on social democracy as \u201csocial fascism\u201d remained in force until 1935 when the Comintern officially switched to endorsing a \u201cpopular front\u201d of socialists, liberals and even conservatives against the Nazi threat -- an attempt to win over the leftist elements of the Nazi Party, especially the SA, who largely came from a working-class background and supported socialist economic policies. By that time, however, Hitler and the National Socialists had risen to power and the KPD had been largely destroyed.) After the Reichstag Fire on 27th of February, 1933, the Nazi Party targeted members of the KPD and other left-wing opponents of the regime in a new wave of violence and arrests; although having gone underground yet again, Th\u00e4lmann was arrested and imprisoned together with his personal secretary Werner Hirsch on the 3rd of March, 1933. == Imprisonment and execution == On the afternoon of the 3rd of March, 1933, eight officers of Police Station 121 arrested Th\u00e4lmann at his self-appointed safehouse, the home of Hans and Martha Kluczynski in Berlin- Charlottenburg. Although the main police informant was a neighbor of the Kluczynskis, Hermann Hilliges,Siehe Eberhard Czichon, Heinz Marohn: Th\u00e4lmann. Ein Report. Berlin 2010, Band 1, S. 683. at least four other people informed the police of the connection between the Kluczynskis and Th\u00e4lmann in the days before the latter's arrest).Ronald Sassning: Th\u00e4lmann, Wehner, Kattner, Mielke. Schwierige Wahrheiten. In: UTOPIE kreativ. Nr. 114 (April 2000), S. 362\u2013375, S. 364 f. Th\u00e4lmann had used the Kluczynskis' home occasionally for several years, but started fully residing there in January 1933. Although it wasn't among the six illegal residences that the military-political apparatus of the KPD had prepared for Th\u00e4lmann, it was not considered known to the police.Siehe Czichon, Marohn: Th\u00e4lmann. Band 2, S. 717. During imprisonment, Th\u00e4lmann managed to smuggle out detailed descriptions of his treatment in writing: \"They ordered me to take off my pants and then two men grabbed me by the back of the neck and placed me across a footstool. A uniformed Gestapo officer with a whip of hippopotamus hide in his hand then beat my buttocks with measured strokes. Driven wild with pain I repeatedly screamed at the top of my lungs. Then they held my mouth shut for a while and hit me in the face, and with a whip across the chest and back. I then collapsed, rolled on the floor, always kept my face down and no longer replied to any of their questions.\" After the German\u2013Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and Germany's invasion of Poland of 1939 -- and despite Th\u00e4lmann's loyalty to Stalin during his time leading the KPD -- Moscow pragmatically removed a slogan for the 1939 International Youth Day which read in part, \"Long live Comrade Th\u00e4lmann!\" and replaced it with, \"Long live the wise foreign policy of the Soviet Union, guided by Comrade Stalin's instructions.\" As it turned out, Th\u00e4lmann's long- time party rival Walter Ulbricht had ignored several requests for help from Th\u00e4lmann's family when the thawing in German\u2013Soviet relations could have made a release possible, preferring to let Th\u00e4lmann remain imprisoned. Fellow German Communist, Wilhelm Pieck had managed to escape to the Soviet Union and in July 1936 he issued a statement calling for the release of Th\u00e4lmann: \"If we succeeded in raising a tremendous storm of protest throughout the world, it will be possible to break down the prison walls and as in the case of Dimitrov, deliver Th\u00e4lmann from the clutches of the Fascist hangmen. The fact that Ernst Th\u00e4lmann has got to spend his fiftieth birthday in the gaols of Hitler-Fascism is an urgent reminder to all the anti-Fascists of the whole world that they must intensify to the utmost their campaign for the release of Th\u00e4lmann and the many thousands of imprisoned victims of the White Terror.\" However, these attempts at raising publicity for his plight were in vain; during the 1930s, numerous German communists who had been close to Th\u00e4lmann had been murdered in Stalin's camps.Regina Scheer: \"Im Schatten des Denkmals.\" Berliner Zeitung. 14 August 2004. Th\u00e4lmann spent over eleven years in solitary confinement. In August 1944, he was transferred from Bautzen prison to Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was shot on the 18th August on the personal order of Adolf Hitler.Notizzettel von Heinrich Himmler, Reichsf\u00fchrer SS, von einer Besprechung mit Adolf Hitler in der Wolfsschanze, 14. August 1944 im Ausstellungskasten 4/31 in der ehemaligen Effektenkammer des KZ Buchenwald: \"12. Th\u00e4lmann ist zu exekutieren\". His body was immediately cremated. Shortly after, the National Socialists claimed in an announcement that, together with Rudolf Breitscheid, Th\u00e4lmann had died in an Allied bombing attack on 23 August.Reiner Orth: Walter Hummelsheim und der Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus. In: Landkreis Bernkastel-Wittlich: Kreisjahrbuch Bernkastel-Wittlich f\u00fcr das Jahr 2011. 2010, p. 336. == Legacy == The Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Monument was erected 1986 in the Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Park, Berlin During the Spanish Civil War, several units of German republican volunteers (most notably the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion of the International Brigades) were named in his honour.Eric D. Weitz, Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State.

(2008) After Empire: Ethnic Germans And Minority Nationalism In Interwar Yugoslavia (PhD Dissertation), University of Maryland, 2008. Th\u00e4lmann's tomb in Berlin In 1935, the former town of Ostheim in Ukraine was renamed Telmanove (Donetsk Oblast). After 1945, Th\u00e4lmann and other leading communists who had been murdered, such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were widely honoured in East Germany, with many schools, streets, factories and the like named after them. Many of these names were changed after German reunification, but streets and squares named after Th\u00e4lmann remain in Berlin, Hamburg, Greifswald and Frankfurt an der Oder. The East German pioneer organisation was named the Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation in his memory. Members pledged that \"Ernst Th\u00e4lmann is my role model ... I promise to learn to work and fight [struggle] as Ernst Th\u00e4lmann teaches\". Tr\u01b0\u1eddng THPT Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (Ernst Th\u00e4lmann High School) in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City In the 1950s, a two-part East German film, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, was produced. In 1972, Cuba named a small island, Cayo Ernesto Thaelmann, after him. One of the main traffic arteries of Soviet Riga was named Ernsta T\u0113lma\u0146a iela after him on completion in 1981; however, soon after Latvia had regained independence in 1991 it was renamed K\u0101r\u013ca Ulma\u0146a gatve, after pre-WWII prime minister K\u0101rlis Ulmanis. In Ho Chi Minh City, the secondary school THPT Ernst Thalmann (Ten L\u01a1 Man) was named after him. The British Communist composer and activist Cornelius Cardew named his Th\u00e4lmann Variations for piano in Th\u00e4lmann's memory. The VEB Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Waffenfabrik, an East German weapons factory in Suhl (formerly Simson), was named after Th\u00e4lmann (until 1990). == Writings (selection) == * * * * * ==See also== * Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island == References == == Sources == *Biography of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann on the website of the Deutsches Historisches Museum * *Timeline of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann's life (in German), at the Lebendiges Museum Online (LEMO): Gerade auf LeMO gesehen: LeMO Biografie == External links == * * Discourses and writings by and about Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, on the Marxists Internet Archive. * Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Memorial in Hamburg, Germany * German song about Ernst Th\u00e4lmann with DDR film footage * Category:1886 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Hamburg executed in Nazi concentration camps Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Independent Social Democratic Party politicians Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic Category:Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund members Category:German people who died in Buchenwald concentration camp Category:Candidates for President of Germany Category:German communists Category:German anti-fascists Category:Politicians who died in Nazi concentration camps Category:German revolutionaries Category:German civilians killed in World War II Category:People executed by Germany by firearm ",
