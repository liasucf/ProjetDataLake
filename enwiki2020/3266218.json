    "text": "Tiki Bar TV was a web series distributed in the pioneering field of video podcasting or \"vodcast.\" Each episode features a problem that is rectified by the episode's namesake cocktail, which is scribbled on a prescription pad by Dr. Tiki and \"filled\" by bartender Johnny Johnny who explains how to make the cocktail. Examples include the Suffering Bastard (episode 2), Fog Cutter (episode 8), Volcano Bowl (episode 11), Boomerang (episode 14), and Blue Hawaiian (episode 25). The drinks did not always follow conventional recipes. Lala is the Tiki Bar's primary denizen who opens each episode with a dance. Most episodes also include a segment called \"Tiki Mail,\" where mail from viewers or disgruntled neighbours is answered, and then ends with outtakes or the cast dancing. Originally shot in an apartment's tiki bar on a low budget, the humorous and heavily ad-libbed show was a creative outlet for its creators Jeff Macpherson and Kevin Gamble. The show garnered additional attention after being mentioned at Apple's iPod Video launch. Tiki Bar TV was shown in Apple stores worldwide as part of a 6-month promotion in 2006. The first episode was released on iTunes on March 13, 2005, with each episode being approximately 5 minutes in length. The show originated from Vancouver, British Columbia and has not been updated since Episode 45 (December 12, 2009). It was produced by Tosca Musk and is considered by many to be one of the pioneering video podcasts credited with launching the genre. ==Characters== *Doctor Tiki, PhD, MD, USB a.k.a. Reginald Hornstein (Jeff Macpherson) writes the cocktail prescriptions in each episode. His doctorate is in \"Tiki,\" and he is usually wearing a lab coat and stethoscope. *Johnny Johnny, Mixologist a.k.a. Jonathan J. Jonathan (Kevin Gamble) is the leopard-print fez wearing bartender who makes the cocktails that the Doctor prescribes.Kevin's day job website *Lala a.k.a. Beatrice Fastwater (Lara Doucette). She usually wears a provocative dress and broad grin. In episode 10, we learn that she is not as ditzy as she appears; she has an engineering degree and in short time built a self-aware robot capable of nearly fulfilling all of Johnny Johnny\u2019s roles. The performers go un-credited and unabashed stage names are given. Jeff Macpherson, who plays \"Dr. Tiki,\" introduces himself as actor \"Reginald Hornstein,\" and when \"Lala\" breaks character, she speaks as actress \"Beatrice Fastwater.\" Dr. Tiki, Johnny Johnny and Lala in an outtake from episode 9 ===Minor characters=== *Limey - (Lee Tockar) A lounge lizard in a reptile leather jacket.
