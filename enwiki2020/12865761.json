    "text": "\"Burn\" is a song by British rock band Deep Purple. It was released on the album of the same name in 1974, and was the first song by the Mark III lineup. ==History== The song remained the band's concert opener for the next two years, taking over from \"Highway Star\".url=http://glover.thehighwaystar.com/rosas/tab/hstar.htm|title= Roger Glover \u2013 the official website It opened Deep Purple's set on the California Jam two months after its release, on 6 April 1974. After Deep Purple's 1976 split-up, Coverdale formed his own band, Whitesnakeurl=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Whitesnake The Official Charts Company |publisher= |df=dmy which over the years has featured Deep Purple members such as Jon Lord and Ian Paice, and has performed Coverdale-era Deep Purple songs such as \"Burn\", \"Mistreated\", \"Might Just Take Your Life\" and \"Stormbringer\". After the Deep Purple 1984 reunion, the song was no longer played, as Ian Gillan, whom David Coverdale had replaced, was vocalist once more, and would not sing songs from the Coverdale era. The band did perform \"Burn\" live in 1991, during the time in which Gillan was briefly replaced by Joe Lynn Turner. When Gillan once more returned to the band in 1992, he again refused to perform Coverdale-era songs. Glenn Hughes also features the song regularly in his live solo performances, as well as with his project, the supergroup Black Country Communion.
