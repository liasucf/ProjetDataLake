    "text": "The AMOS (Hebrew: ), an acronym for Affordable Modular Optimized Satellite, is a family of light weight satellite buses for geostationary orbit communication designed and manufactured by IAI of Israel. ==Families== Little is known regarding the different variations. But it is known of at least two built versions and a possible third in development. ==AMOS (original)== The AMOS bus is a lightweight version used for satellites between , with 800 W to 1700 W of power. The platform started with the Amos-1, the smallest of all the family, and increased mass, payload successively in the Amos-2 and Amos-3. ==AMOS 4000== The AMOS 4000 platform is the second generation, a much bigger and sophisticated platform. It is prepared for satellites weighing between and with power generation between 3 kW to 12 kW. It offers more autonomous capabilities and advanced control applications. It is composed of three modules: Bus, Repeater and Earth Facing Antennas. Only two satellites have used this bus: Amos-4, massing and generating 6 kW of power. And Amos-6 at and generating 10 kW. But Amos-6 is enhanced by using electric propulsion for station keeping only. Orbit raising is still done by the more traditional and faster chemical propulsion. ==AMOS E== The next development of the AMOS platform is the implementation of pure electric propulsion. The increased efficiency for orbit raising and station keeping in comparison to chemical propulsion can result in reductions of mass of up to 50%. The expected spacecraft mass will be in the range and offer an expected life of 15 years. This new product will be ready by 2018 and IAI expect it to win some foreign orders. ==List of AMOS-based satellites== The currently known uses of the AMOS platform has been for most of the AMOS series of civilian communications satellites operated by Spacecom, also of Israel. * Amos-1 * Amos-2 * Amos-3 * Amos-4 * Amos-6 ==See also== * Ofeq \u2013 Ofeq family of satellites on which technology the first versions of the AMOS platform was based. * EROS (satellite) \u2013 EROS family of Earth observation satellites also made by IAI. ==External links== * IAI site on the AMOS satellites ==References== Category:Satellite buses * Category:Communications satellites Category:Satellites of Israel ",
