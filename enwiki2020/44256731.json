The club reached the final of the 1937 Palestine Cup, where they lost 0\u20133 to their parent club, Hapoel Tel Aviv. The club later reformed and played at the lower tiers of the Israeli league until it merged in 1961 with Hapoel Kiryat Shalom. ==History== The club, a farm club of Hapoel Tel Aviv, was formed in 1936. Hapoel HaDarom played in the 1936 Palestine Cup, where they drew 1\u20131 with Maccabi Hasmonean Jerusalem. The 1936 Palestine Cup was eventually stopped after only three matches were played, due to the outbreak of the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt. In the 1937 Palestine Cup, Hapoel HaDarom defeated Maccabi Avshalom Petah Tikva 5\u20132 in the Quarter-finals and qualified for the Semi-finals, where they faced Maccabi Tel Aviv. Hapoel HaDarom upset Maccabi Tel Aviv with a 2\u20131 victory, to set a meeting with its parent club, Hapoel Tel Aviv in the final. The victory was assisted by a punishment issued to the senior Maccabi Tel Aviv squad for boycotting Maccabi's match against Aris Thessaloniki in April 1937. Due to the punishment, Maccabi had to field its youth team for the match. In the final, Hapoel HaDarom were defeated 0\u20133 by Hapoel Tel Aviv.Hapoel Tel Aviv win Palestine Cup Palestine Post, 11.5.1937, Historical Jewish Press After the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the club had reformed at the beginning of the 1957\u201358 season, and was placed in Liga Gimel.
