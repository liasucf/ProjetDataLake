On the way to the station Katya manages to catch and pass over a saboteur to the border guards. Then she rides the train without a ticket to write a complaint, which means that she has to work as a waitress in the dining car, and gets into Moscow. On the train, Katya meets a sailor Sergei, but upon arrival in Moscow they lose each other. Katya gets employed as a saleswoman in a fur shop and after that at a factory of gramophone records. At the same time she actively convinces female colleagues at work go to the Far East. For a long time Sergei is looking for Katya and finally his search is a success.
