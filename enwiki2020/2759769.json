He was the second Satguru of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) from the death of Baba Jaimal Singh in 1903 until his own death on 2 April 1948.Sondhi, S. L. (Ed.) (1981).

Before he died, he appointed Sardar Bahadur Jagat Singh as his spiritual successor.Radhasoami Reality: the logic of a modern faith by Mark Juergensmeyer. p.52.

Garland Publishers, New York ==Honorifics== Although he did not refer to himself with these, the following appellations and honorifics have been used to refer to Sawan Singh: *Bade Maharaj Ji *Hazur Maharaj *Sawan Shah *the Great Master *Hazur Baba Sawan Singh Ji Maharaj ==Life== Sawan Singh Grewal was born into a Grewal Jat Sikh family in the village of Mehma Singh Wala, District Ludhiana, in pre-partition Punjab. His father was Subedar Major Kabul Singh Grewal and his mother was Jiwani. He was married to Kishan Kaur and together they had three children. He passed engineering at Thomason College of Civil Engineering, Roorkee and later joined the Military Engineering Service. He studied scriptures of various religions but retained a strong connection with the Gurbani of the Sikh religion.Spiritual Gems, Letter No.1. He had contact with a mystic of Peshawar named Baba Kahan who he hoped to get initiation from but was refused: :\"I associated with him for several months and during that time he showed supernatural powers on several occasions. When I asked him if he would shower grace upon me by initiating me, he answered: 'No, he is somebody else; I do not have your share'. I then asked him to tell me who that person was so that I could contact him. He replied: 'When the time comes, he will himself find you'.\" Later when Sawan Singh was stationed at Murree, he met Baba Jaimal Singh, who said to his companion that he had come to initiate Sawan. After much philosophical debate, discussion and several conferences with Jaimal Singh, Sawan Singh became thoroughly convinced and received initiation from Jaimal Singh into the practice of surat shabd yoga on the 15th day of October, 1894. Sawan Singh retired on government pension in 1911 to Dera Baba Jaimal Singh (Beas), the \"camp of Baba Jaimal Singh\" where Jaimal Singh had settled in 1891. During his ministry the Dera expanded greatly, with houses for both permanent residents and guests, a library and a Satsang Hall. Sawan Singh sheltered victims of the communal holocaust of the Partition of India. His following included Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, and for the first time, thousands from abroad. He had initiates from America, England, Switzerland, Germany, most notable of whom being the Americans physician-surgeon Dr. Julian Johnson and chiropractic-osteopath Dr. Randolph Stone and the Swiss physician- homeopath Dr. Pierre Schmidt. ==See also== * Radha Soami * Surat Shabd Yoga * Swami Shiv Dayal Singh * Sant Jaimal Singh * Sardar Bahadur Jagat Singh * Charan Singh * Kirpal Singh ==Notes and references== ==Further reading== *Sawan Singh, Dawn of Light. *Sawan Singh, Discourses on Sant Mat. *Sawan Singh, My Submission. *Sawan Singh, Spiritual Gems. *Chara\u1e47 Singh, Spiritual Heritage. *Jaimal Singh, Spiritual Letters. *Kapur, Daryail\u0101l, Call of the Great Master. *Kapur, Daryail\u0101l, Heaven on Earth. *Kirpal Singh, A Brief Life Sketch of Hazur Baba Sawan Singh Ji Maharaj. *Moss, Cami, Glimpses of the Great Master. *Munshi Ram, With the three Masters. ==External links== *Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) *Science Of The Soul Research Centre Category:People from Ludhiana district Category:1858 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Radha Soami Category:Sant Mat gurus Category:Punjabi people Category:Indian Sikhs Category:Scholars from Punjab, India ",
