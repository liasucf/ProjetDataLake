    "text": "was initially the main antagonist of the 2009 film Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy, and has made subsequent appearances in the Ultra Series. He was originally an Ultra Warrior of the Land of Light, but his proud nature caused him to try and harness the power of the Land of Light's power source, the Plasma Spark, which led to his banishment and transformation into his current monstrous state after being merged with Alien Raybrad. He was imprisoned by Ultraman King for attempting to invade the Land of Light, but was eventually freed by Alien Zarab many years later and defeated by Ultraman Zero. Ever since then, the two have been archenemies, constantly clashing should they cross paths. Uniquely among other evil Ultras, Belial is the first whose origin is from the Land of Light, like most of the Showa Ultras. In Ultraman Geed, Belial was revealed to have fathered the series namesake Ultraman, who was born from his own genetic material. In Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy and Revenge of Belial, Ultraman Belial was voiced by comedian of the manzai duo Ameagari Kesshitai. Starting from Ultra Zero Fight 2 and so on, he was voiced by . His suit actor was in the first movie and as of Kaiser Belial. ==Character conception== Belial is designed by Masayuki Gotou and Junya Okabe, who used a shark as his motif basis. As for his movements, this was instructed by the director Koichi Sakamoto. Belial's suit was simultaneously made with Ultraman Zero, based on wetsuits with the materials shaped in a three- dimensional appearance. As a result, his body pattern is three-dimensional instead of coloured. The element of wire fu is also included in Belial's actions, and thus two wires were used: up and action. Although the mask was originally moulded integrally with the head, Belial and Zero were structured out of plane. In the original plan, the mask was supposed to have a mouth- opening mechanism but this was removed to better fit the suit actor. In hopes of emphasizing the concept of \"evil Ultraman\", his body posture and neck hunch forward. In Ultraman Geed, Koichi Sakamoto regarded the season as Ultraman Belial's final chapter from his first appearance in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy and is also his first time fighting on Earth. Writer Otsuichi decided to tone down his chimpira-esque trait towards one that is worthy of an evil emperor. Arch Belial as designed by Masayuki Gotou. Other forms are as follows: *Early Style: Belial's original form prior to his corruption, this suit was made by modifying Ultraman Zearth's. *Belyudra: The gigantic chimera monster Belial constructs and 'pilots', made from the inhabitants of the Monster Graveyard. Initially assumed to be CGI, an actual suit was made. The suit is moving one by one to the head, torso, right arm and left arm. After creating a three-dimensional mould, the suit was fully materialised through 3D printing. *Kaiser Belial: The design drawing is based on a photo of Belial's suit. The original draft was meant for Belial to wear a set of armour but due to the lack of improvement, it was reduced to face scar and mantle. Kaiser Belial's suit was modified from the original Belial, where it received new mask and the neck portion modified to better fit the mantle. Under request of director Yuichi Abe, the claws are elongated, forming Kaiser Belial Claws. Suit actor Hiroshi Suenaga mentions that Belial is supposedly to have the calmness of an emperor in contrast to his brutish trait from the last movie. He also complains on how he struggled wearing the Belial Mantle due to weighing about 10 kg. *Arch Belial: It was labelled as during the initial concept. Since the antagonist characters are all robots and humanoid, a monstrous character was proposed. The staffs have troubles in maintaining the suit due to its fragile structure as a result of deciding its appearance late. The design aims to unify the image of Belial by retaining the colouring pattern. Much decoration was made so that its image would not be compared to final villains of past Ultra Series. His designer likewise is also Masayuki Gotou, who previously did for the original Belial and was manufactured by Light Sculpture Studios. *Zero Darkness: This form (or rather, possession) uses the body shape of Ultraman Zero augmented with Belial's colourings. *Chimeraberus: Masayuki designed it to not resemble any of the Monster Capsule component it uses (Zog and Five King), but instead a simplified version of Belyudra. As a differentiation from Arch Belial, Koichi Sakamoto proposes a half-man/beast hybrid themed monster and he also implemented its ability to absorb Ultraman Geed as a frame by frame replication of Alien Rayblood's assimilation with Belial from Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy. *Ultraman Belial Atrocious: Based on the early design of Ultraman Geed, Masayuki chooses a stylish appearance that is closer to normal Ultras, rather than Belial's original hunching position and the skeleton-like detail is designed with three dimensional parts. Instead of grotesque monster forms like Ultraman X and Ultraman Orb proposed, Atrocious was given as a conflict between two Ultras. His fight with Geed on a night scene in episode 25 took cues from that of the heroic Ultra and Skull Gomora from the first episode. ===Naming=== His name, Belial, is a reference to the similarly named devil in the Judaism and Christianity religions. ==History== ===Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy=== Long ago, Belial was a powerful Ultra Warrior and a friend to Father and Mother of Ultra in their younger age. After participating in the Great Ultra War, Belial seek inspiration in Alien Empera's army and grew envious to the Father of Ultra's election as the Supreme Commander of the Space Garrison. This jealously tempted Belial to steal energy from the Plasma Spark in hopes of obtaining greater power, only for the energies to inflict him pain in the attempt as he was banished soon after for his selfish act of endangering Planet Ultra. It was then that Belial encounters the spirit of Alien Raybrad, who further corrupted Belial by forcefully entering the Ultraman's body and transforming him. Now an Ultraman Reionics with an army of 100 monsters at his command, Belial orchestrated the to attack the Land of Light until he was defeated by Ultraman King and imprisoned in the while his Giga Battle Nizer was sealed in the Valley of Flames. Belial attacking the Land of Light During the events of Ultra Galaxy, Belial was freed by Alien Zarab, who assumed they can form an alliance before his liberator killed him. Belial fought his way through the numerous Ultramen in the Land of Light to successfully steal the Plasma Spark, turning his homeworld into a frozen wasteland. Belial uses the Plasma Spark's power to revive the Monster Graveyard's residents before being challenged by Ultraman, Ultraseven, and Ultraman Mebius, who brought the Human Reinoics Rei for additional aid. But Belial, learning of their ties as Reinoics, corrupts Rei to attack his comrades until his ZAP Spacy teammates restore his senses. All seemed lost until Ultraman Zero appears and avenges his father Ultraseven by effortlessly defeating the remnants of Belial's army and then Belial himself. But Belial summons the souls of the Monster Graveyard's monsters to join with him to create the gigantic Belyudra with the evil Ultraman as its brain. Belial has Belyudra overpower everyone present until Rei uses hijacked the Giga Battle Nizer to take control of the composing the monsters, leaving Belial as Zero apparently kills him while the others destroy Belyudra. But as the Plasma Spark is restored, it would be revealed that Belial survived. In the English dub, Belial is voiced by Beau Rue Marie. ===Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial=== Following his defeat at the Monster Graveyard, gaining a large scar from Zero's attempted death blow, Belial established the Belial Galactic Empire under the name Kaiser Belial. His forces based in the hand-like Malebrandes space station, Belial led his army to conquer the planet Esmeralda in another universe to usurp its supplies of emeralds. During that invasion, Belial drove off all resistances while corrupting Esmeralda's protector Mirror Knight and had the whole planet chained to his base, Malebrandes. He also send the mass-produced army of Darklopses, robots based on Zero's specs, to invade Planet Ultra before they are destroyed by the Space Garrison. When Zero (in his human host Run) was captured by Iaron, Belial had his rival imprisoned in his command center and forced him to watch his homeworld invaded while holding his Ultra Zero Eye before Mirror Knight freed him. When Zero regained his Ultraman form, Belial absorbed all of the emeralds he harvested to become Arch Belial, successfully overpowering Zero and holding off against the resistant forces. Setting his sight on Planet Esmeralda, Belial prepared to destroy the planet, but not before Zero and his allies formed an energy shield and died from exhaustion. It was then that the hopes from the resistance brought forth the Shield of Baraj, which transformed into the Ultimate Aegis and for Ultraman Noa to revive Zero. Transforming into Ultimate Zero, the rest of his comrades delay Belial long enough for him to deliver the finishing blow, successfully killing him in the process. In the English dub, he is voiced by Kyle Rea. ===Ultra Zero Fight=== Ultraman Belial's spirit soon made his way to the Monster Graveyard and possessed Armored Darkness, forming another army called the Darkness Five, consisting of five evil aliens whose races had fought the Ultra Warriors before. After successfully rescuing Pygmon and defeating Sly of the Dark Magic, Zero soon met Armored Darkness, then revealed to be housing Belial and re-dubbed as Kaizer Darkness, fully healed to the point that his previous scar had vanished. When the two archenemies clashed once more, Zero managed to deliver a killing blow, but this was a part of Belial's plan to possess his rival and be reborn as Zero Darkness, using Ultraman Zero's own power to assassinate the Ultimate Force Zero. With victory in his grasp, Belial was about to lead the Darkness Five in a conquest of the whole universe but while attempting to kill a helpless Pygmon, it was then that Zero regained control. Lashing Belial for not being a true Ultra Warrior, Zero expelled the evil Ultra from his body. Revealing a new form, Shining Zero, the gilded warrior reversed time in the immediate area to undo all the damage done by Belial and revived his fallen friends. The Darkness Five soon retreated, but because of Shining Zero, Belial was also revived. Belial resorted to make himself stronger as he led the Darkness Five. ===Subsequent history=== *Ultraman Retsuden (2011-2013): Belial and the Darkness Five appeared during the 100th episode anniversary of Ultraman Retsuden, hijacking the television program from Ultraman Zero. As a commemoration, Belial tried to narrate all 100 monsters that make up the fusion of Beryudora but because of the time limit, he could only narrate 13 monsters, lashing out at the series for having a short running time. In a similar fashion to Zero, Belial acted as the straight man, often clashing with Glocken of the Freezing in a manner similar to a manzai. Amusingly enough, he also narrated Ultraman Joneus' fight with Red Smog from the 1979 anime Ultra Series The Ultraman and desired to star on his own anime, calling it as . In the 103rd episode, after narrating the episode, Belial took his leave, noting how Zero became stronger due to his desire to protect the weak, resolving to find something that he can protect to become stronger. **Shin Ultraman Retsuden (2013-2016): Belial made his only appearance in episode 49.

(2015): Ultraman Belial was cloned by Etelgar into an and stationed at the fourth floor of his space-time castle. Facing Ultraman Zero, the two fought in an intense battle before Zero used his Mode Changes and finished Belial with Shining Zero's Shining Emerium Slash. *Ultraman Orb (2016): An Ultra Fusion Card of Ultraman Belial was originally in possession of Alien Mefilas Nostra. Jugglus acquired the card after he assassinated Nostra, to which he declared as the . Juggler unsealed Maga-Orochi through Ultraman Belial's card, destroying Zoffy's card in turn and eventually given to Gai/Ultraman Orb alongside Zoffy's card by Tamayura. While Gai has no problems with Zoffy, he was never able to call out Belial's power due to the card's refusal, but Tamayura's sacrifice allowed Gai to use the card in full anger and gave birth to his new form, Thunder Breastar, therefore defeating Maga-Orochi. Usage of this form, however, puts his mind into the state of a berserk, which almost cost the life of Naomi, Gai's friend and caretaker when he faced the robot Galactron which put her life as a hostage. It was not until Gai started to be confident in his powers, not only being able to control the form but also regaining Orb Origin. During the final episode of the series, Belial and the other Ultra Fusion Cards in Gai's possession transform into physical projections of themselves to assist Ultraman Orb in delivering the finishing blow on Magata no Orochi, while Juggler held off the monster long enough to expose its weak spot. In episode 25, he is portrayed by suit actor . *Ultra Fight Orb (2017): Reibatos, a fellow Reionics, tried to revive Belial's original legacy by recreating the Giga Battle Nizer. After surviving Orb's attacks, he tried to revive Belial as a final act of revenge. But Reibatos finds out that the spell is not working and realizes that the evil Ultraman is already alive as Belial, initially appearing as Geed in his Primitive form. Belial quickly killed Reibatos and reclaimed his weapon. ===Ultraman Geed=== Prior to the series, after killing off Reibatos, Belial battled the Ultramen once more as they developed the Ultra Capsules as a way to fight him before he detonated a Super Dimension Eradication Bomb as a last resort, destroying himself while wiping out the known universe in an event that came to be known as the . But through Ultraman King's intervention, the universe was restored with Belial reduced to an incorporeal state as he takes refuge in a dimensional tear while entrusting the Alien Sturm Kei Fukuide to steal the Ultra Capsules and Risers from Planet Ultra to orchestrate his restoration. To that end, Kei created the Nebula House and used a sample of Belial's DNA to create Riku Asakura as the Sturm's pawn. 19 years later, their plan were put into motion as they orchestrate Riku's transformation into Ultraman Geed (destroying his house and leaving behind a set of Ultra Capsules (among them being the - his own power) and a Riser) and had him collect the Ultra Capsules in hopes of restoring Belial's corporeal form. He also had Kei play the role of the monsters by providing him means of transforming into , a classification of chimeric monsters who bear Belial's . As a result of AIB's investigation, Belial chastised Kei for his failure to secure all eight Capsules from Riku and the vulnerability of exposing their hideout, forcing him to utilize them within his Sturm Organ as Pedanium Zetton. Although Zero managed to seal the entrance to Belial's dimension, he easily escaped sometime later as he raced towards Earth and absorbed Geed as the Belial Fusion Beast Chimeraberus. Belial's attempt to completely absorb his son while winning him over with illusions failed due to Zero, Laiha and King's intervention, allowing Geed to escape, obtain King's Ultra Capsule and destroy Chimeraberus with his new Royal Mega Master form. Despite his apparent death, Belial lived on, having chosen a young woman named Arie Ishikari as his host to keep tabs on Kei until his Sturm Organ was ready for him to take as his own. Abandoning his host and Kei, having incorporated the Sturm Organ into his body to siphon King's essence to use a power source, Belial uses the Dark Lugiel and Alien Empira Monster Capsules to assume his Atrocious form. While his ability to absorb King's power is severed, Belial manages to overwhelm his opposition before Geed manages to drag his father into a dimensional void and, making a final attempt to reason with his father after seeing his memories. Unfortunately as Belial was too focused on his grudges, Geed was forced to kill in a beam struggle. His death in the final episode sealed his fate to remain spiritually trapped in the dimensional void whereas Geed escaped not long after. ===Legacy=== *Ultraman Geed The Movie (2018): Belial was mentioned in a passing by Airu Higa when explaining the origin of Giga Battle Nizer, which she revealed as a simultaneous/accidental creation by the Kushia People while creating the Giga Finalizer. *Ultraman R/B (2018): Representing the element of darkness, Belial's R/B Crystal was obtained from Planet Sanja by the Ultraman brothers, Rosso and Blu.

She would keep the Crystal for 13 centuries after their deaths and eventually relinquish it to the Minato brothers, which they finally used to combine into Ultraman R/B. *Ultraman R/B The Movie (2019): During his stay in the Minato family's household area, Riku brought up his origin and association to Belial towards Asahi while the latter was questioning her own existence. *Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes (2019): The emotional trauma from being possessed by Belial caused Zero to have his own Darkness Copy modeled after Zero Darkness.

Arie was a late addition by Koichi Sakamoto, as her debut episode by Otsuichi was never meant to feature said character. In the original planning, director Takesue envisioned a doppelganger of Riku Asakura (wearing a mask) plots to revive Belial but decided to use Arie for this after realizing that the first one was difficult to be written in the story.
