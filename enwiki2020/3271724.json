    "text": "Shouzou Kaga (\u52a0\u8cc0\u662d\u4e09 Kaga Sh\u014dz\u014d, born 1950) is a Japanese video game designer and scenario writer best known as the creator of the Fire Emblem series. During his career at Intelligent Systems, he would lead the development of Fire Emblem from its inception until the release of Fire Emblem: Thracia 776. In addition to being development lead, he was a major creative contributor to each game's setting, story, and presentation. Following his departure from Intelligent Systems in 1999, he continued work in game design by founding the independent studio Tirnanog and going on to develop the Tear Ring Saga series, whose close similarities to Fire Emblem would prompt a lawsuit from Nintendo. Following the release of Berwick Saga in 2005, Kaga took an apparent hiatus from video game production, lasting a decade until the production and release of Vestaria Saga in 2016. ==Games designed== *Fire Emblem series **1990 \u2013 Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light **1992 \u2013 Fire Emblem Gaiden **1994 \u2013 Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem **1996 \u2013 Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War **1997 \u2013 BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki **1999 \u2013 Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 *Tear Ring Saga series **2001 \u2013 Tear Ring Saga **2005 \u2013 Berwick Saga *Other **1998 \u2013 Super Famicom Wars **2000 \u2013 Trade & Battle: Card Hero (Technical Adviser) **2016 \u2013 Vestaria Saga ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Nintendo people Category:Fire Emblem Category:Japanese video game designers Category:Video game writers ",
