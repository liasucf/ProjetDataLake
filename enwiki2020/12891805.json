However, they decided that before they did so, they would perform one last short tour across Canada as a \"Thank You\" to their fans. The tour was called \"The Watchman's Last Road Trip\" and included 9 concerts in 6 Canadian cities and 1 American city. As an extra special thank you to fans, the band released full soundboard recordings from each concert via download, first from their own site and then via Maple Music. The cost was $10.00 CDN per show. Among fans of the band, this has become known as the Last Road Trip Download Series. Throughout the tour, the band consisted of original band members Daniel Greaves (Vocals & Harmonica), and Joey Serlin (Guitar) with Ken Tizzard (Bass) who had been with the since their second album, and Ryan Ahoff (Drums) who replaced original drummer Sammy Kohn.
