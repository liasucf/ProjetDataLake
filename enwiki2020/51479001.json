The portrait depicts the New York architect and philanthropist Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes (1867\u20131944) and his wife, Edith Minturn Stokes (1867\u20131937), whom he married in 1895, and had previously posed for Daniel Chester French's Statue of The Republic that was featured at the World's Columbian Exposition. The portrait was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple and originally planned to feature Edith alone in evening wear. It was then changed to Edith in day wear posing next to a Great Dane. The dog became unavailable, and Isaac stood in its place. ==References== Category:1897 paintings Category:19th-century portraits Category:Group portraits Category:Paintings by John Singer Sargent Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Portraits of men Category:Portraits of women ",
