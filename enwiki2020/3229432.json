    "text": "Golachab is the Qliphah corresponding to the Sephirah Geburah on the kabbalistic tree of life. Its name means the \u2018Burners with Fire\u2019, and the image of the demons associated with it are of enormous black heads like a volcano in eruption. The Qliphoth are the shadow of the Sephirot, the chaotic force that exists when that sephirot is out of balance. Geburah is the sephirot of Restraint, which takes away that which is unnecessary in the cosmos, destroys the wicked, fights evil and injustice, and maintains an equilibrium with Chesed, Loving kindness. However, it is obvious to see that when this force is out of balance, it becomes too destructive, and burns that which should not be burned. While the Klipot of Chesed may represent unbridled conservatism, Golachab represents unbridled radicalism and tyranny, that brooks no opposition, and executes all its opponents.
