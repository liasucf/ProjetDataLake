Wright Mills Award for Best Book, among other honors. Small is currently writing a book on the evolution of social support networks among graduate students and studying the formal and informal systems of support among low-income mothers in New York, Chicago, and Huston. He has shown that poor neighborhoods in commonly-studied cities such as Chicago are not representative of ghettos everywhere, that how people understand and make sense of their neighborhood shapes how it affects them, and that local organizations in poor neighborhoods often broker connections to both people and organizations. Small has also demonstrated that people\u2019s social capital\u2014including how many people they know and how much they trust others\u2014depends on the organizations in which they are embedded. His work on methods has shown that many practices used to make qualitative research more scientific are ineffective. Small is currently working to understand why ghettos differ from city to city and how people decide whom to turn to when seeking support. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Panamanian sociologists Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Carleton College alumni Category:Princeton University faculty Category:University of Chicago faculty ",
