    "text": "P\u00e8re Jean-Marie Delavay (28 December 1834 - 31 December 1895) was a French missionary, explorer and botanist. He was perhaps the first Western explorer of the region which is now encompassed by the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas. Delavay was born in Les Gets, Haute-Savoie, in 1834. As a missionary for Missions Etrang\u00e8res de Paris (Foreign Missions of Paris) he was sent to China in 1867, serving first in Guangdong, then moving to north- western Yunnan. While in France in 1881, on a break from his duties, Delavay met the natural history collector and fellow missionary P\u00e8re Armand David, who had made his final collecting expedition in China in the 1870s. David encouraged Delavay to continue his collecting work and send specimens to the Paris Museum of Natural History. In 1888 he contracted bubonic plague; he survived the initial onslaught of the disease, but never fully recovered. This did not stop his explorations, however, eventually he travelled to Hong Kong to recuperate, collecting plants all the way. It was while in Hong Kong that he discovered what is now the territories emblem, the Hong Kong orchid tree Bauhinia \u00d7 blakeana. By 1891 it was clear that a more drastic cure was needed, so Delavay returned to France in hopes of gaining a full recovery. Unable to stay away, he returned to China in 1893 and continued his collections, adding another 1550 plants to his already impressive total, but in 1895 he finally succumbed to his illness, and died in Yunnan province aged 61. ==Legacy== Delavay was an avid plant collector, sending over 200,000 herbarium specimens back to France, from which numerous new genera and over 1,500 new species were described, many by Adrien Ren\u00e9 Franchet of the Paris Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle. ==Eponymy== Delavay is commemorated in the names of several plants, including Delavay's Fir Abies delavayi, Delavay's Magnolia Magnolia delavayi and Delavay's Peony Paeonia delavayi. ==References== Category:French botanists Category:Botanists active in China Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in China Category:Christian missionaries in Tibet Category:French explorers Category:1834 births Category:1895 deaths Category:People from Haute-Savoie Category:French expatriates in China ",
