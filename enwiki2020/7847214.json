The film stars Alfre Woodard, Al Freeman, Jr., Esther Rolle (in her final film appearance before her death), Loretta Devine, and Wesley Snipes. ==Plot== Rosa Lynn Sinclair, an elderly woman, lives in a Chicago housing project with her daughter Loretta (Woodard) and her two grandchildren, two-year-old Tracy (who is autistic) and thirteen\u2013year-old Thomas. Disappointed in Loretta's life choices and afraid of the troubled circumstances surrounding her grandson Thomas, Rosa Lynn decides to send her daughter and her grandchildren to visit with her brother-in-law in Mississippi for the summer. Loretta is a drug addict and does not want to go, especially since her uncle Earl lives in the dry and rural part of Mississippi. Uncle Earl already has his hands full with his business and a wife, Annie who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. During their stay, Earl has Loretta help him in his restaurant, and the family begin to find strength in their roots, and start to rebuild their lives. An important recurring object throughout the film is a silver candelabra, a family heirloom. The candelabra, which everyone refers to as \"Nathan,\" has strong significance to the family. It is finally revealed that Loretta's great-great-grandfather and Jesse's father was a slave named Nathan, and he was traded for the candelabra. Jesse stole back the candelabra, and it has been passed through the generations, along with Nathan's story, ever since. ==Cast== * Alfre Woodard as Loretta Sinclair * Al Freeman Jr. as Earl Sinclair * Esther Rolle as Annie Sinclair * Mary Alice as Rosa Lynn Sinclair * Loretta Devine as Zenia * Wesley Snipes as Will Sinclair * Anne-Marie Johnson as Monica Sinclair * Mpho Koaho as Thomas Sinclair * Justin Lord as Dr. Rainey * Kulani Hassen as Tracy Sinclair * Sandra Caldwell as Volunteer * Colleen Williams as Tourist Woman * Richard Blackburn as Tourist Man * Philip Akin as Manager * Mary Fallick as Drug Addict * Sandi Ross as Pawnbroker * Barbara Barnes-Hopkins as Prim Woman * Richard Yearwood as Marco ==Music== The following soundtrack was released by Virgin Records. # \"Believe in Love\" - Sunday # \"God's Stepchild\" - Janet Jackson # \"Heaven Must Be Like This\" - D'Angelo # \"If Ever\" - Stevie Wonder # \"Where Would I Be\" - The Leverts (Eddie, Gerald, and Sean) # \"I'm Only Human\" - Luther Vandross (featuring Cassandra Wilson and Bob James) # \"Just A Little Luv\" - Shawn Stockman # \"We Belong Together\" - Tony Thompson And Antoinette # \"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\" - Chaka Khan # \"Let It Go\" - Jazzyfatnastees featuring The Roots # \"My Soul Don't Dream\" - Meshell N'degeocello & Keb' Mo' # \"Uh Uh Ooh Ooh Look Out Here It Comes\" - Ashford & Simpson # \"Don't Let Nuthin' Keep You Down\" - Sounds of Blackness # \"Family (Score)\" - Stanley Clarke # \"The Rain\" - Tracie Spencer # \"Patchwork Quilt\" - Sweet Honey in the Rock ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film was successful on limited release. ===Critical response=== Alfre Woodard's work drew praise from San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Peter Stack, who lauded her for \"a beautifully layered performance...Woodard is magical as a single mother haunted by drugs, alcohol and an inadequate education. She almost single-handedly shores up this somewhat simplistic movie...[h]er instincts for drama and humor provide a welcome dose of human reality, saving a script that veers toward the sentimental.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 films Category:1998 drama films Category:African-American drama films Category:Chinese films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Films produced by Wesley Snipes Category:Films scored by Stanley Clarke Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in Mississippi Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Films directed by Maya Angelou Category:Canadian films Category:1998 directorial debut films ",
