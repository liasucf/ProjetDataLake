    "text": "Prostitution in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is present in different forms. Prostitution may be brothel-based or non-brothel based as in the case of call girls. Prostitution is legal in India. ==Prostitute population== The total number of prostitutes in Kolkata is unknown. Some estimates state that there are more than 6,000 brothel-based women and girls in prostitution in Kolkata.Plight of prostitutes in Kolkata. Merinews.com. Retrieved on 23 October 2011. The population of prostitutes in Sonagachi constitutes mainly of Nepalese, Indians and trafficked Bangladeshis women. Some sources estimate that are 30,000 Bangladeshi women in the brothels of Kolkata. According to some sources the most common form of trafficking consists in offering false promises or some offer of help out of a dead-end or crisis situation, force is used later after the prostitutes have already been sold. \"Mashis (brothel owners/older sex workers) use friendship, sympathy, also veiled threats to convince the women that it is now in their best interest to conform and begin working.\" ==History of Prostitution== A farcical short-drama book named Beshyaleela ( \u09ac\u09c7\u09b6\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09b2\u09c0\u09b2\u09be ) was printed in the middle of the year 1880 written by an anonymous writer ( \u0985\u099c\u09cd\u099e\u09be\u09a4\u09a8\u09be\u09ae\u09be ). It is not very familiar or much discussed book till now. In this drama, a good description can be found about the negative attitudes shown by the then existing 19th century educated Bengali Babu class of people towards the prostitutes and the prostitution. From the first half of the 19th century, centering on Sonagachhi, a huge organised prostitution area surrounding Cornwallis Street on the east, and Chitpur on the west were formed. Although many areas in Calcutta were inhabited by those prostitutes outside those areas also. On the south it was Kalighat to Khidirpur dock areas, in the middle-Calcutta it was Kalinga- Fenwick Bazar, on the far south in Kareya area many girls from different social-classes of Hindu-Muslim-Christian communities were engaged with this profession. More than that, there was no clear 'mark' or 'boundary-line' between the 'gentleman areas' and the 'prostitutes areas'. Many areas had scattered or mixed up population of those two kinds. Rather, many areas could be termed as 'half-gentleman' areas, where normal gentleman's families and various types of prostitutes co-existed side by side. From the middle of the 19th century, the British colonial administration, Christian Missionaries, and native English-knowing educated 'Victorian' Indian gentlemen started campaign against prostitutes. This was their part of the project of social 'sanitation' process for creating the so-called 'gentle-society'. Under the leadership of Mr. Kaliprasanna Singha, the 'Vidyotsahini Sabha' ( \u09ac\u09bf\u09a6\u09cd\u09af\u09cb\u09ce\u09b8\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0 \u09b8\u09ad\u09be ) submitted one mass-petition in the Indian Legislative Council. ==Red-light districts== ===Bowbazar=== Bowbazar has a red-light district where about 12,000 prostitutes work. The surrounding areas are inhabited by slum dwellers, truckers and migrant labourers. The adjacent Tiretta Bazar area is mainly a loadingunloading point with offices or godowns of a large number of transport companies. The area is very unsanitary. ===Garia=== There is a small red-light district in Garia. There were plans to build a home for retired sex workers in the area. ===Kalighat=== In south Kolkata, there is a red light district in the neighbourhood of Kalighat. Located around the banks of the Adi Ganga canal, an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 prostitutes live and work there. Kolkata has emerged as a hub for the trafficking of girls, who often arrive from Nepal, Bangladesh and Burma. From Kolkata they are often sold again to brothels in Mumbai (Bombay) or Chennai (Madras). Some will go on to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Many of the women in Sonnagachi were forcedly taken away from their homes; some were tricked and others sold into prostitution by their friends and families; most of them are illiterate.Prostitutes Calcutta Sex Slaves.

NGO Apne Aap has a support centre in the area and has made two films about life in Kidderpore's red-light district: Kali and Shaadi Ka Shart Shauchalaya. ===Lebu Bagan=== There is a small, little known red-light district in north Kolkata called Lebu Bagan. About 100 prostitutes work there in four streets. ===Sonagachi=== The largest red-light district in Kolkata, is Sonagachi, it is also the largest red-light district in India. The area came to be known as Sona Gachi from a Sufi saint Sona Ghazi whose tomb (mazaar) is located in the locality. It is an area with several hundred multi-storey brothels, and around 10,000 sex workers.Girl-trafficking hampers Aids fight BBC news. 30 November 2004 Sonagachi is located in North-Kolkata near the intersection of Chittaranjan Avenue Sova Bazar and Beadon Street, just north of the Marble Palace. Previously there were many Bengali prostitutes in Sonagachi. But now-a-days Rajasthani and Khamia-Nepalese prostitutes have gained in number. According to class-division, the red-light areas of Kolkata are also divided into four different classes: poor-class, lower-class, middle- class, and rich-class. For example, The red-light area which once existed opposite to the diagonal angle of Khanna Cinema Hall was of 'poor-class'. When they contacted customers, they asked them \"Khat-e na Chot-e\" ? Which means, \"Do you want to sleep in wooden cot or on jute-sheet spread over the floor?\" As customers wished, the fee varied according to their choice. The lower-class and middle-class of prostitute areas were scattered around Haarkaata Gully and near Chetla/Kalighat bridge. The areas near Elliot Road could not be exactly referred as a 'prostitute area'. Mainly Anglo-Indian citizens lived there. Prostitutes who also lived there in different houses, they used to do their business in Kothhas or Kuthhis (small empty rooms for prostitution purpose only) scattered over the area. The Bengali customers generally never visited those Kuthhis. In Sonagachhi, few houses can be seen marked with the lines, \"\u0987\u09b9\u09be \u09ad\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09b2\u09cb\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c0\" which means, \"This is a gentleman's house\". People who are not involved in any way with prostitution business and do other good jobs, and lived in their family-owned houses for many years, but who have not been able to move out of the area due to financial or other reasons, they have marked their houses as such so that they are not disturbed by customers or any other persons in any way. There are some difference between the character of Sonagachhi and Soho of London or Pigul of France. The character of race courses and red light areas of different cities of the world are almost same. But the character of Sonagachhi is a little bit different. Prostitution in Kolkata is illegal like many other big cities of the world. Though it is flourishing right in front of the nose of the administration. Several non- government organizations and government organizations operate here for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including AIDS. Sonagachi project is a prostitute's cooperative that operates in the area and empowers sex workers to insist on condom use; a relatively low percentage of prostitutes in this district (5.17% of the 13,000 prostitutes in Sonagachi) are estimated to be HIV positive.In Sonagachi, keeping HIV away a daily battle.

However, these efforts are hindered by human trafficking: refusal of clients to wear condom, and women controlled by third parties are forced to oblige. According to some sources, prostitutes from Sonagachi who test HIV positive are not told about the results, and live with the disease without knowing about it \"because the DMSC is worried that HIV positive women will be ostracized.\"Welcome to Sonagachi \u2013 Calcutta's largest brothel area is thriving.
