It is a shrub with the stems densely branched near their ends, linear leaves and one, two or three pink flowers near the ends of the branches but usually only at the top of the shrub. ==Description== Kunzea pauciflora is a shrub that typically grows to a height of with stems that are densely branched near their ends. The leaves are linear, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers appear singly, in pairs or groups of three to five on the ends of long shoots or branches.

The specific epithet (pauciflora) is derived from the Latin words paucus meaning \"few\" or \"little\" and flos meaning \"flower\" or \"blossom\".Allen J. Coombes D.
