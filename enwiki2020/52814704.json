    "text": "The Gray Man is the debut novel by Mark Greaney, first published in 2009 by Jove Books. It is also the first novel to feature the Gray Man, freelance assassin and former CIA operative Court Gentry. The novel follows Gentry on a mission across Europe to rescue his handler, Sir Donald Fitzroy, and his family in Normandy, France from Lloyd, a member of a massive French corporation who wants Gentry terminated in order to shepherd a billion dollar deal for oil interests in Nigeria, where its president in turn wants Gentry dead for the assassination of his brother. == Film adaptation == There have been several attempts to turn the novel into a film, initially with Christopher McQuarrie attached to direct in 2016. After that version fell through, the project laid dormant until July 2020, when Netflix announced their plans to adapt it. Joe and Anthony Russo are set to direct, with Joe Russo also writing the screenplay, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely performing a re-write. Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling are attached to star, with filming scheduled to commence in early 2021 on a $200 million budget. == References == Category:2009 American novels Category:2009 debut novels ",
