Riddle (1870 -) a native of Lynchburg, Tennessee, in Moore County, was born to Martin Van Buren and Theresa (nee Tucker) Riddle and raised in his native state, until he enrolled in school at Lebanon, Ohio.Douglas, Clarence B. The History of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Volume III. S. J. Clarke Publishing Co. Chicago-Tulsa (1921) p.490-1 Available on Google Books. Accessed May 20, 2020. It is unclear whether Riddle graduated from NNU, but evidently the school did not have a curriculum in law. Later, Riddle studied law under Judge Samuel A. Billingsley, and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1894. == Career == The young lawyer decided his future would be made in the West, and moved to that part of Indian Territory containing the town now known as Chickasha, Oklahoma. He established a private practice of lawyers that was retained on most of the important legal cases that appeared before the territorial courts before the state of Oklahoma was organized. In 1904, Riddle became eligible to present cases before the United States Supreme Court.Thoburn, Joseph B. A Standard History of Oklahoma. Vol. III. The American Historical Society. Chicago and New York. (1916) p.1078 Available on Google Books. Accessed May 13, 2020. In April, 1914, Riddle was appointed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Governor Lee Cruce to complete the unexpired term of the recently-deceased Chief Justice Samuel W. Hayes, whose term was scheduled to expire in January, 1915. He accepted, even though he continued to live in Chickasha while he served. During the eight months following his appointment, he reportedly wrote eighty opinions, a number never exceeded by an Oklahoma justice in such a short time.Geist, Susan. Transcribed from Joseph B. Thoburn and Muriel H. Wright. Oklahoma: A Story of the State and Its People. Vol. IV. (1929) Accessed May 20, 2020. Riddle served as chief counsel in the impeachment trial of Governor Jack C. Walton and chief counsel for Lt. Governor Martin E. Trapp in a suit to determine whether Trapp could succeeded himself after replacing Walton. Riddle's effort was successful. The Riddles moved to Tulsa after he resigned from the Supreme Court in 1919. He spent the rest of his career as the junior partner of Linn & Riddle. == Personal == Riddle married Miss Letitia Cloud, daughter of a rancher who lived in Gainesville, Texas. The wedding occurred in 1896. They had one child, daughter Frances Alee Riddle, who was born in 1900. Frances was noted for her equestrian skills and won a blue ribbon at the Oklahoma State Fair in 1914. == See also == * National Normal University == Notes == == References == Category:1870 births Category:People from Chickasha, Oklahoma Category:Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma Category:People from Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Oklahoma lawyers Category:Justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law ",
