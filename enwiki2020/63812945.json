The company contracted for its first satellite, a space telescope, to be built by DFH Satellite, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), \"the state-owned main contractor for China\u2019s space programs.\" The company was established in 2017, and raised additional capital in 2019 through a angel round led by Linear Venture and Matrix Partners China. The long-term goal is to \"develop mineral resources such as rare-earth metals from near- Earth asteroids. The initial company focus is on fielding multi-spectrum space telescopes. A small ultraviolet spectroscopy telescope flew in Earth orbit in late 2019. The company is working on an x-ray space telescope with Hong Kong University, and signed a contract to build an optical telescope, the same type as the Hubble Space Telescope flown by the US government. ==References== Category:Private spaceflight companies Category:Chinese companies established in 2017 ",
