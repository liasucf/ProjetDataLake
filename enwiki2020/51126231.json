It houses the office of the Minister-President of Wallonia, and is located in Namur, Namur province, Belgium. == History == View of the \u00c9lysette by night, Meuse side. Built in 1877 by master-tanner Xavier Thibault, it was bought by the Walloon Region to the city of Namur. This building, hosting the office of the Minister-President, as well as his official residence, is on the right shore of the Meuse river, in Jambes, the administrative borough of Namur, capital of Wallonia. For the Minister-President's good services, you can find there kitchens, two bedrooms for the servants, garages, offices and meeting rooms (especially the Council of Ministers' Room). A flat, consisting of a bedroom, a dining room, a bathroom and a living room is next to the Minister- President's Office. The \u00c9lysette faces the Parliament of Wallonia. This one is on the left shore of the river, next to the Grognon (confluence between Meuse and Sambre rivers). == Bibliography == * L\u2019\u00c9lysette : la pr\u00e9sidence du Gouvernement wallon \u00e0 Namur, Jacques Vandenbroucke, Namur : Institut du patrimoine wallon, 2010, 40 p., Carnets du patrimoine , .
