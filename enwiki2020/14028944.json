    "text": "Music for Children is the first release in John Zorn's Music Romance Series and features three Naked City compositions (written at the time of Torture Garden) performed by Zorn with the band Prelapse; a 20-minute composition for wind machines and controlled feedback systems dedicated to Edgar Varese, and a classical chamber music piece for violin, percussion and piano performed by the Abel-Steinberg-Winant Trio framed by a poly-rhythmic etude for percussion and celeste and a lullaby for music box.Tzadik catalogue ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Stacia Proefrock awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, stating \"The adventurous parents who actually play this music for their child may be horrified to discover how much the little baby genius actually likes it. For those who are childless or simply less brave, this volume provides fascinating candy for adult ears.\"Proefrock, S.
