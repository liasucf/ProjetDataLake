    "text": "Edward Arthur Toth is an American musician who currently plays drums for The Doobie Brothers. Toth joined the Doobies in 2005 following his departure from Vertical Horizon. Always interested in music, Toth says that he has been drumming most of his life. He made good use of his father's record collection and was active in all music programs in East Lyme, Connecticut, playing in his high school band at East Lyme High School. He went on to the University of Miami's Frost School of Music, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994. While still at school, Toth became a member of the funk/rock band Jennifer Culture. Toth has played in numerous other rock and funk bands over the last decade. Most notably, he was a member of Vertical Horizon from 1996\u20132005, which yielded a multi platinum album Everything You Want, the title track of which also charted #1. Toth's association with the group began when he was working at a Boston Borders Books; The mother of Vertical Horizon's lead singer and guitarist Matt Scannell, was shopping in the bookstore and asked Ed for a Vertical Horizon CD, which he had listened to and quite enjoyed. His enthusiasm for the recording impressed Scannell's mother so much that, in gratitude for the assistance she received at the store, she offered to put the bookstore manager and a friend on the guest list for a Vertical Horizon show at Mama Kin, an Aerosmith-owned nightclub, also in Boston. Toth went to the show as the manager's friend; and when the band had an opening for a drummer, Toth auditioned for the spot. When the Doobie Brothers' drummer, Keith Knudsen, died of cancer in 2005; Toth was selected to fill his spot with the band. He has remained as drummer for the band, first in addition to Michael Hossack. After Hossack's untimely passing, Tony Pia was added, and after Pia's departure, Toth became the sole drummer in the band. Toth has been influenced by Stewart Copeland, Neil Peart, Bill Bruford, and a host of other virtuoso drummers. He has also produced some critically acclaimed albums and started a band called Cooper with his friend, Tim Bradshaw. ==References== ==External links== *Amarillo Globe News: Vertical Horizon, Bookseller's life changed by joining band Category:American rock drummers Category:People from East Lyme, Connecticut Category:University of Miami alumni Category:Vertical Horizon Category:The Doobie Brothers members Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Connecticut Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
