    "text": "Montenegro competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics since it gained independence from Serbia in 2006. Montenegrin Olympic Committee sent a team of 34 athletes, 17 per gender, to compete in seven different sports at the Olympics, matching the nation's roster size with London 2012. Women's handball and men's water polo were the only team-based sports in which Montenegro had representatives at the Games. Among the sports represented by the athletes, Montenegro marked its Olympic debut in tennis. The Montenegrin team featured a number of returning Olympians; seven of them have attended in every edition of the Games since Montenegro's official debut eight years earlier, including six water polo players, led by captain Predrag Joki\u0107, and half-middleweight judoka Sr\u0111an Mrvaljevi\u0107 (men's 81 kg). Meanwhile, handball team captain Bojana Popovi\u0107, who helped her fellow players deliver a historic silver-medal finish for Montenegro in London four years earlier, became the nation's first ever female athlete to carry the flag in the opening ceremony. Montenegro narrowly missed an opportunity to add another medal to its Olympic treasury in Rio de Janeiro, as the men's water polo team, led by Joki\u0107, lost to the Italians for the bronze with a score 10\u201312. ==Athletics== Montenegrin athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Key *Note\u2013Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only *Q = Qualified for the next round *q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target *NR = National record *N/A = Round not applicable for the event *Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round ;Track & road events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Sla\u0111ana Perunovi\u0107 |align=left|Women's marathon |colspan=\"2\"| |} ;Field events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Qualification !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position |-align=center |align=left|Danijel Furtula |align=left|Men's discus throw | |\u2014 |colspan=2|Did not advance |} ==Handball== ;Summary Key: * ET \u2013 After extra time * P \u2013 Match decided by penalty-shootout. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=6|Group Stage !Quarterfinal !Semifinal !colspan=2|Final / |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Montenegro women's |align=left|Women's tournament | L 19\u201325 | L 25\u201327 | L 21\u201325 | L 19\u201328 | L 23\u201329 |6 |colspan=3|Did not advance |11 |} ===Women's tournament=== The Montenegrin women's handball team qualified for the Olympics by virtue of a top two finish at the second meet of the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Aarhus, Denmark. ;Team roster ;Group play \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Judo== Montenegro has received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send a judoka competing in the men's half-middleweight category (81 kg) to the Olympics. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !Round of 64 !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !Repechage !colspan=2|Final / |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Sr\u0111an Mrvaljevi\u0107 |align=left|Men's \u221281 kg | | L 000\u2013002 |colspan=6|Did not advance |} ==Sailing== Montenegro has qualified one boat in the Laser class through the individual fleet World Championships. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=11|Race !rowspan=2|Net points !rowspan=2|Final rank |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 !6 !7 !8 !9 !10 !M* |-align=center |align=left|Milivoj Duki\u0107 |align=left|Men's Laser |12 |26 | ~~35~~ |24 |33 |19 |32 |34 |33 |29 |EL |232 |29 |} M = Medal race; EL = Eliminated \u2013 did not advance into the medal race ==Swimming== Montenegro has received a Universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics, signifying the nation's return to the sport after an eight-year hiatus. {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Maksim Ini\u0107 |align=left|Men's 50 m freestyle |23.88 |51 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Jovana Terzi\u0107 |align=left|Women's 100 m freestyle |59.59 |42 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==Tennis== Montenegro has entered one tennis player for the first time into the Olympic tournament.
