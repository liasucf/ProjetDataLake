In its form the soaz, salam and Marsiya, with a rhyming quatrain and a couplet on a different rhyme. This form found a specially congenial soil in Lucknow (a city in Northern India), chiefly because it was the center of Shia Muslim community, which regarded it an act of piety and religious duty to eulogies and bemoan the person who killed in the battle of Karbala. The form reached its peak in the writing of Mir Babar Ali Anis. A soaz is written to commemorate the honor of Ahl al-Bayt, Imam Hussain and Battle of Karbala. The sub-parts of Marsiya can be called Noha and soz which means the lamentation and burning of (heart) respectively. People who recite soaz are known as soazkhawan. ==See also== *Syed Ali Ausat Zaidi, Prominent Urdu Soazkhawan *Marsiya *Noha *Rawda Khwani ==External links== *Soazkhwani by Professor Sibte Jafar Zaidi *Soaz by Sibte Jaffer *Soazkhwani by Syed Ali Ausat Zaidi *Soazkhwani by Azeemul Mohsin *Soazkhuani by Muhammad Ali Naqvi, Hasan Abid Jafri, Abid Hussain Naqvi Category:Urdu poetry Category:Shia literature Category:Cultural depictions of Husayn ibn Ali ",
