The main task was to perform reconnaissance for army units. In 1930, the duties were extended to bombing with B 4 and later B 5 planes. In 1936, the Flying Corps was reorganized as an own branch (the Air Force) and the unit was renamed J\u00e4mtlands Flygflottilj (J\u00e4mtland Air Force Wing). In 1947, the wing was yet again redesigned as a fighter wing and received surplus P-51 Mustangs designated as J 26. These were only kept for five years until they were replaced by J 28A jets in 1952. Again, after only four years, they were in turn replaced by J 29A in 1956. In 1967, the J 32B entered service at the wing only to be replaced again in 1969 by J 35D. These served until 1984 when the Saab 37 Viggen was introduced as served the wing for 20 years. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven famously served as a Munitions Systems specialist Conscript with the F 4 Wing for the duration of his 1-year compulsory military service in 1976-77. The JAS 39 Gripen served briefly for only a year as a replacement for the Viggens until the wing was decommissioned in 2005. The airfield is known today as \u00c5re \u00d6stersund Airport . ==Barracks and training areas== In the rangers' old camp below Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 Church on Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n outside \u00d6stersund. The wing had a runway in the north-west-southeast direction.

At the end of the 1940s, the wing commander got the rank of colonel. From 1980 to 1994, the wing commander was referred to as sektorflottiljchef (\"sector wing commander\") and had the rank of colonel 1st class.
