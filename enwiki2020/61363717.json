    "text": "The University City of Caracas is a World Heritage Site in Caracas, Venezuela. It is a functional university campus for the Central University of Venezuela, as well as home to 108 notable works of art, as well as famous examples of creative architecture. Many works of art are modernist and mosaic. The campus was designed by architect Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva, who oversaw much of the construction and design work. Villanueva primarily enlisted artists who were either European or had European influences \u2013 Villanueva himself had been inspired for the campus design in Paris \u2013 including members of Los Disidentes, a group of Venezuelan artists who left for Europe to break from the Mexican mural tradition. Some artists did not initially want to work on the project, as they were opposed to the military dictatorship in place in Venezuela at the time, but French artist Fernand L\u00e9ger encouraged them to participate by saying that \"dictatorships pass but art remains\"; part of Villanueva's intention was unity. In their book Modern Architecture in Latin America: Art, Technology, and Utopia, Carranza and Lara discuss the 'movements' of Villanueva's Synthesis of the Arts, and the functions of certain pieces within their spaces. == By Venezuelan artists == ===\"El primer libro\"=== Just inside the main entrance of the Central Library is a stone depicting a petroglyph, carved by ancient indigenous people of Venezuela. The story of its placement is that it is the first book of the library, waiting for somebody to come and read it, but nobody can because the language is lost. Based on comments from scholars and university figures, it has been deemed that these people do not consider the petroglyph stone to be part of the university's heritage, nor as one of the campus works of art; the same distancing is seen with other elements of indigenous culture across the country. Map reference on this page: L5. ===Francisco Narv\u00e1ez=== Construction of the campus began in the late 1940s, with the first artworks being installed in 1950. These were designed by Francisco Narv\u00e1ez for the medical complex. Narv\u00e1ez, an old friend of Villanueva, created many pieces of artwork for the campus, in various media.:137 The mosaics at the entrance to the Institute of Experimental Medicine were installed by Mar\u00eda Luisa Tovar. Three statues by Narv\u00e1ez on the campus are made of Cumarebo stone: El Atleta, a large statue in the sports complex, and La educaci\u00f3n and La ciencia in the medical complex.:137 These last two are detailed depictions of female nudity,:137 something Narv\u00e1ez covers in his art with different materials frequently. The Cumarebo stone is a favorite material of Narv\u00e1ez. A slightly later statue, La cultura (identified as \"Sculpture\" in Fraser's book), is more figurative, showing the influence of the European artists designing for the campus on Narv\u00e1ez.:137 {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Artworks by Francisco Narv\u00e1ez in University City of Caracas !Work !Description !Year !Location !Map ref. |- |Untitled mural |Mosaic mural of surgical and religious imagery, including Adam and Eve and the Holy Grail |1950 |On the right-side wall at the entrance to the Institute of Experimental Medicine |H5 |- |Cristo |Painted fresco depicting Jesus on the cross, surrounded by female figures |1950 |Behind the altar in the Chapel of the University Hospital |H13 |- |La educaci\u00f3n |Statue, made of Cumarebo stone, of a woman sitting sideways and balancing a book on a raised knee |1950 |On the first floor terrace of the Institute of Experimental Medicine |H6 |- |Untitled mural |Mosaic mural of anatomical images, including a Vitruvian woman |1950-51 |On the left-side wall at the entrance to the Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo Institute of Anatomy |H12 |- |Untitled mural |Mosaic mural of a sea life scene, including fish, a shark, and an octopus |1951 |On the wall of the university dining space; damaged during renovations |C1 |- |La ciencia |Statue, made of Cumarebo stone, of a woman sitting sideways and a boy kneeling in her lap, in the position of Jesus on the cross |1951 |On the first floor terrace of the Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo Institute of Anatomy |H11 |- |El Atleta |Statue, made of Cumarebo stone, of a stylized geometric male athlete in an Atlas pose |1951-52 |Outside the University Olympic Stadium |S1 |- |Untitled sculpture |A bronze wall-mounted sculpture of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez, with a microscope and dedication plaque |1953 |On an outside wall of the Institute of Experimental Medicine |H4 |- |La cultura |Bronze sculpture of an abstract figure |1954 |Originally placed on the tenth floor terrace of the Central Library, it was then moved to the garden of the medical complex.

Restorer Fernando de Tovar has described the replica as \"ridiculous\"; it was made by Silvestre Chac\u00f3n in 2004, to protect the original, which has significant heritage value. This has been a point of controversy, with some arguing that the original's heritage means it should be the only one displayed, rather than hidden for safekeeping. The original statue has been kept locked in a workshop at UCV since 2004, despite orders to put it back along the highway. It was significantly damaged when the local council took the mold to create the replica. The statue was originally made to sit outside the Olympic Stadium for the 1951 Bolivarian Games. With the expansion of the city, the road system was made larger, and the statue was moved a short distance to an island between lanes of the highway. {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Artworks by Alejandro Colina in University City of Caracas !Work !Description !Year !Location !Map ref. |- |Mar\u00eda Lionza |Giant statue depicting the indigenous goddess Mar\u00eda Lionza riding a tapir and holding aloft a woman's pelvis |1951 |Original in a UCV workshop; replica along the Francisco Fajardo freeway |S9 |} ===Armando Barrios=== Villanueva approached Armando Barrios in 1952 to create a number of murals for the campus. Barrios' murals are mosaics made of glass, and are considered part of his \"abstract-geometric\" period. After 1954, his work became less abstract and incorporated more identifiable human figures. As a music lover, Barrios incorporated a musical flow into his designs. Julio Nicol\u00e1s Camacho has described the mural on the Museum building of Rectory Plaza poetically, referring to the images as \"curtains that imitate waves [and] mountain peaks\".:509 The mural is high and over long, and is said to be a \"pictorial melody\". Carranza and Lara wrote that the mural \"aims at dematerializing the structure and form\" of the museum away from a purely functional grid-like building. The Olympic Stadium murals use mosaic tiles imported from Venice. The mural here with horizontal stripes is also considered \"melodic\", with Ronnie Saravo S\u00e1nchez writing that the use of color and the Renaissance influence \"link it conceptually with movements such as Cubism and Russian constructivism, [and] served as a support for the creation of a new universe where the figure and background are diluted until reaching an almost abstract stylization\". {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Artworks by Armando Barrios in University City of Caracas !Work !Description !Year !Location !Map ref. |- |Untitled mural |A graphic design of overlapping lines in shades of bright blue, green, yellow and grey; the color changes where lines intersect.

Bogen had already cultivated an interest in combining art and architecture when making great murals for walls and doors, and the Synthesis of the Arts project allowed him to explore this. He also contributed several works, including murals and glassworks, to the UCV CDCH campus. {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Artworks by Carlos Gonzal\u00e9z Bogen in University City of Caracas !Work !Description !Year !Location !Map ref. |- |Untitled mural |Geometric shapes, mostly triangles or based on triangles, in grey, black, and yellow on a white background |1951 |On the facade of the University Olympic Stadium, fifth mural from south to north |S6 |- |Untitled mural |Geometric shapes, mostly triangles or based on triangles, in blue, black, and yellow on a grey background |1951 |On the facade of the University Olympic Stadium, first mural from south to north |S2 |- |Untitled mural |Orange, brown, and black rectangles of different sizes and perpendicular orientation are shown |1953 |Lower floor of the central library, at the front of the hall of the humanities/reading hall |L8 |- |Untitled mural |Rectangle and similar shapes in various shades of grey create a pattern on a wall behind stairs, there are some orange rectangles near the top |1953 or 1954 |In the atrium of the Aula Magna |A2 |} ===Mateo Manaure=== Mateo Manaure has a reported 26 pieces of work on the campus. Though his pieces are mostly ceramic murals, he also created wooden acoustic frames and stained-glass windows. In addition, he created ventilation elements of the hospital lobby. Most were completed in the 1950s, but in 1998 he was asked to create a structure to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences (FaCES). Manaure's mural on the exterior of the curved Sala de Conciertos was said by Mayerling Lopez to be an inventive response to the architectural restrictions, one that also created dynamism by combining horizontal stripes within vertical stripes, and the other way around. {| class=\"wikitable mw- collapsible\" |+Artworks by Mateo Manaure in University City of Caracas !Work !Description !Year !Location !Map ref. |- |Untitled mural |A graphic design of straight and curved lines primarily in black, yellow, orange, and blue.
