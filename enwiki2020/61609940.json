She founded the Boston Ideal Opera Company (later known as \"The Bostonians\") in 1879. == Early life == Effie Hinckley Ober was born in Sedgwick, Maine, and brought up in Blue Hill, the daughter of Samuel Ober and Mary Peters Hinckley Ober.

Whitney among the cast members. Her company presented American operettas, popular operas such as The Bohemian Girl and The Marriage of Figaro, and the Gilbert and Sullivan favorite H.M.S. Pinafore. Ober traveled with the company as its manager until she resigned in 1885. \"For five years I have given my undivided attention to the affairs of the company, and I can assure you that the work is of the most wearing character,\" she explained. \"I will retire from the field entirely satisfied with the result.\" Journalist Nellie Bly called Effie Ober \"A Plucky Woman\" in an 1885 profile. The company continued after her tenure. In 1887 she assisted her old company in resolving an internal dispute: \"Miss Ober is here to give us her advice as to our course next season.\" Kline later served on the Board of Managers of Cleveland's Lakeside Hospital, and chaired the board's library committee. == Personal life == Effie H.
