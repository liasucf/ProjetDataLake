Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. Some sources give Derbyshire and though this was once accepted in some publications, including Wisden on the basis of the \"least matches lost\" principle, it has been superseded. Hampshire, though regarded until 1885 as first-class, played no inter-county matches between 1868 and 1869 or 1871 and 1874. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketer's Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1875 * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers' Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1875 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1875 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1874 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
