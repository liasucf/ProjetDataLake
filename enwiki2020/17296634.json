She was Abbess of Chelles. ==Biography== Marie Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde d'Orl\u00e9ans was born at the Palace of Versailles on 13 August 1698. After the marriage of her aunt \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte d'Orl\u00e9ans, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was known at court as Mademoiselle de Chartres. She assumed the style of Mademoiselle d'Orl\u00e9ans in 1710 after her older sister Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans married Charles, Duke of Berry. Her siblings were: *Mademoiselle de Valois (17 December 1693 - 17 October 1694) *Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Berry (20 August 1695 - 21 July 1719) *Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Modena and Reggio (20 October 1700 - 19 January 1761) *Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (4 August 1703 - 4 February 1752). *Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans, Queen of Spain (11 December 1709 - 16 June 1742) *Philippine \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans, Mademoiselle de Beaujolais (18 December 1714 - 21 May 1734) *Louise Diane d'Orl\u00e9ans, Princess of Conti (27 June 1716 - 26 September 1736). ===Character=== Very close to her sisters Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth and Charlotte Agla\u00e9, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was considered the most beautiful of the Orl\u00e9ans daughters. Her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, described her in the following manner: > ...[She is] well made, and is the handsomest of my granddaughters. She has a > fine skin, a superb complexion, very white teeth, good eyes, and a faultless > shape. Her hands are extremely delicate, the red and white are beautifully > and naturally mingled in her skin. I never saw finer teeth; they are like a > row of pearls.Letters from Liselotte: Elizabeth-Charlotte, Princess Palatine > and Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans Pierre Drevet. Also according to her grandmother, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was very passionate about music and showed an interest in both theology and the sciences.The Memoirs of Reign of Louis XIV: Elizabeth-Charlotte of The Palatinate In particular, she was intrigued with the science of surgery which was then going through an era of change and improvement. On her entrance into a convent, Louis Racine composed a verse about her: :Plaisir, beaut\u00e9, jeunesse, honneurs, gloire, puissance, :Ambitieux espoir que permet la naissance, :Tout au pied de l'Agneau fut par elle immol\u00e9.\"Pleasure, beauty, youth, honors, glory, power; Ambitious hope allowed by birth; At the feet of the Lamb were by her offered in sacrifice.\" Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and her sister Charlotte Agla\u00e9 were both placed in the Abbey of Chelles from a young age. Their education was briefly interrupted in 1710 for the wedding of their oldest sister Marie Louise \u00c9lisabeth. Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Charlotte Agla\u00e9 held her train.The Orl\u00e9ans Daughter Initially, young Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was considered as a possible bride for her cousin, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Prince of Dombes. He was the eldest son of her uncle, the Duke of Maine and his wife, Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon. As the eldest son, he was the heir to his father's immense fortune. Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, very pious by nature, though, refused his hand in marriage. The young prince then turned to her younger sister, Charlotte Agla\u00e9, who also refused his hand. Both the Prince of Dombes and Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde eventually died unmarried. Another possible candidate was James Francis Edward Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\" to the British throne. In 1716, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde wanted to marry the Chevalier de Saint-Maixent; he was one of the King's pages, who had saved her from an accident during a hunt at the cost of an injury which nearly proved fatal. Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde tried as much as she could to try to get her parents' permission to marry the young Chevalier but both refused. The Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans was horrified at the suggestion of such a mesalliance and reportedly treated Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde so harshly on the subject that it caused her to \"take the veil\" and become a nun. It was on 31 March 1717 that she took the veil officially; the ceremony was held in front of her parents. ==Abbesse de Chelles== As a result of the scandalous life led by her older sister, the Dowager Duchess of Berry who was notoriously promiscuous and concealed several pregnancies, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde decided to become a nun. Her parents, as well as her paternal grandmother, were opposed to it, but she became a nun anyway. As a nun, she took the name of S\u0153ur Sainte-Bathilde (Sister Saint Bathilde) in 1717. She held that name until the next year. While at Chelles, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde showed a slight interest in Jansenism. During the Regency of Louis XV, Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was seen as the preeminent religious figure in the country. In 1719, she became the Abbess of Chelles, a post she held until her death. She was also the Abbess of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, a church built under the auspices of her maternal and paternal great-grandmother, Anne of Austria, the wife of King Louis XIII. Her elder sister, the Duchess of Berry died on 21 July 1719 and was found to be pregnant again, just over three months after suffering a horrendous confinement during which she had been denied the Sacraments.The Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon on the reign of Louis XIV and the Regency, chapter XXIII, pp. 206-220. In 1720, when Charlotte Agla\u00e9 had to leave France to meet her husband in Modena, she insisted on seeing her sister before she left. According to their grandmother, it was a sad scene. While at Chelles Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde greatly embellished the Abbey: she ordered the repaving of the cloisters, the restoration of the Chapter Room, had an infirmary constructed, and had a system where drinkable water could be accessed by the Abbey members as well as the town. Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde also allowed the Sisters of the Abbey of Nevers to build a house in the town in order to help educate the local girls. She was known as Madame d'Orl\u00e9ans while at Chelles from 1719 until 1734.thePeerage.com - Person Page 4471 She died at the age of forty-four from smallpox at the Convent de la Madeleine de Traisnel in Paris. ==Ancestors== ==Titles and styles== *13 August 1698 - 6 July 1710 Her Serene Highness Mademoiselle de Chartres *6 July 1710-1719 Her Serene Highness Mademoiselle d'Orl\u00e9ans **She took on this style due to the marriage of her older sister to the Duke of Berry.
