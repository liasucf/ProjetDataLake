    "text": "F\u00edachu Findoilches, son of F\u00ednnachta, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his uncle G\u00e9de Ollgothach, whom, according to some versions, he had killed. His epithet findoilches means \"white or fair hidden one\",Dictionary of the Irish Language (DIL), Compact Edition, Royal Irish Academy, 1990, pp. 307, 320 although some sources call him F\u00edachu Cendfinn\u00e1n (\"little white/fair head\"), perhaps confusing him with the much earlier Fir Bolg king of that name. It is said that all the cattle, or flowers, of Ireland had white heads in his reign, and that he exacted a tax on white-headed cattle. He founded Kells, County Meath.R. A.
