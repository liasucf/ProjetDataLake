    "text": "P\u00e9c or P\u00e9cz (also Peech or Pech) was the name of a gens (Latin for \"clan\"; nemzets\u00e9g in Hungarian) in the Kingdom of Hungary. The powerful and illustrious Marcali and Apponyi noble families descended from this kindred. The clan had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to Slavonia and other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. ==History and family tree== ===Zala branch=== The clan originated from Sokor\u00f3 Hills, in the southern region of Gy\u0151r County, their ancient clan estates laid in present-day Felp\u00e9c and Kaj\u00e1rp\u00e9c. The earliest known member of the kindred was Lucas I, who lived in the early 13th century. He is apparently the founder of the clan too. Based on the clan's coat-of-arms (narrow silver stripe in blue shield), it is possible that Lucas was a knight from Western Europe, who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of Andrew II of Hungary. For his military service, he was granted lands in Gy\u0151r County and the surrounding regions. Depending on his origin (German or French), Lucas might have come to the country as an accompanist of either Gertrude of Merania (1205) or Yolanda de Courtenay (1215), the first and second spouse of Andrew II, respectively. His career and life is difficult to outline: it is presumable that he is identical with that Lucas, who served as Master of the cupbearers in the royal court from 1229 to 1230. Lucas' eldest son was George, who owned Ludbreg sometimes before 1248. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson Nicholas Ludbregi in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban John Cs\u00faz and his descendants. The most powerful member of the kindred was George's another son Denis. Initially, he was a confidant of rex iunior Stephen, but later joined the partisans of the elderly B\u00e9la IV of Hungary. He actively participated in the military campaigns against Austria and Bohemia. He served as Palatine of Hungary and other high- ranking positions several times during the era of feudal anarchy. His son, John was isp\u00e1n of Veszpr\u00e9m County as a confidant of Queen Mother Tomasina Morosini in 1295, while his unidentified daughter married Stephen Hah\u00f3t. Through their only son Nicholas, they were ancestors of the powerful B\u00e1nfi (B\u00e1nffy) de Als\u00f3lendva noble family.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus Hah\u00f3t 1.) George's third son was Serfesd, who owned Nevna (or N\u00e9vna), present-day Levanjska Varo\u0161 in Croatia. His only son Ladislaus Nevnai held estates in Valk\u00f3 and Po\u017eega counties, including Orjava (today Orljavac, Croatia), and was considered one of the richest landowners of the region. He fathered two daughters, Catherine and an unidentified girl. Their marriages to Nicholas Treutel and Andrew Garai, respectively, have prompted the rise of the Treutel kinship and the Palatinal branch of the Garai family. Ladislaus Nevnai handed over his estate of Nevna to his son-in-law Nicholas Treutel in 1324. It is presumable, he died shortly thereafter without male descendants, ending the Nevnai family line after two generations.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) George's younger brother was Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Alongside two other local nobles, he unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit for the ownership of some portions of Kaj\u00e1r (present-day Kaj\u00e1rp\u00e9c) in 1240; B\u00e9la IV ruled in favor of the Bakonyb\u00e9l Abbey, referring to St. Ladislaus' royal charters from the late 11th century. He had five sons; Gregory was one of the military leaders of the Bulgarian campaign in 1266. He was Ban of Barancs and Kucs\u00f3 in 1272\u201373, then Judge royal in 1288. It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgy\u00f6rgy in order to protect his landholdings against the K\u0151szegi family. However they besieged and captured the fort from Gregory's only son Joachim around 1315. Through his only son Stephen, Joachim was the forefather of the illustrious Marcali family, which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 2. Marcali branch) Mark I's second son Mark II (fl. 1275) remained insignificant member of the clan. His granddaughters' filial quarter was divided between his brothers' surviving branches in 1349. The third son, Apor was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, during the era of Interregnum. He had no descendants. Stephen I was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lor\u00e1ntfis and S\u00e1ndorfis.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 3. Berzencei [Musinai] branch) Lucas III served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County from 1289 to 1291 and in 1298. He and his brother Apor besieged and captured T\u00e1tika Castle (located near Zalasz\u00e1nt\u00f3), which belonged to the property of the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m. Thereafter, Lucas and his offspring were sometimes called with the title \"of T\u00e1tika\".Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 4. Szentgy\u00f6rgyi branch) However the castle was lost to the K\u0151szegi family by 1314, when Andrew K\u0151szegi owned the fort. Lucas had five sons; one of them Apor took the Szentgy\u00f6rgyi surname, and became the first member of that short- lived family. *Lucas I, possibly Master of the cupbearers (1229\u201330) **George (fl. 1232\u201356), isp\u00e1n of Zala County (1243\u201344) ***Denis (fl. 1256\u201385; d. before 1288), Palatine of Hungary (1273\u201374, 1277\u201378, 1283\u201384) ****John (fl. 1292\u20131321; d. before 1327), isp\u00e1n of Veszpr\u00e9m County (1295) ****a daughter \u221e Stephen Hah\u00f3t ***Serfesd Nevnai ****Ladislaus Nevnai (fl. 1284\u20131324) \u221e Yolanda K\u00f3r\u00f3gyi *****Catherine (fl. 1324) \u221e Nicholas Treutel *****a daughter \u221e Andrew Garai ***Peter Ludbregi (fl. 1278) ****Nicholas Ludbregi (fl. 1317\u201357\u2020) \u221e Tetis Bednyai **Mark I (fl. 1240\u201345) ***Gregory (fl. 1266\u201396 or 1309), Judge royal (1288) ****Joachim (fl. 1311\u201321), ancestor of the Marcali family ***Mark II (fl. 1275) ****Roland *****daughters (fl. 1341) ***Apor (fl. 1280\u20131307\u2020), Palatine of Hungary (1298\u201399, 1304\u201307) ***Stephen I (\"L\u00e9g\"; fl. 1289\u201396), ancestor of the Berzencei family ***Lucas III (also Lucas of T\u00e1tika; fl. 1289\u201398), isp\u00e1n of Zala County (1289\u201391, 1298) ****Desiderius (fl. 1311\u201360) ****Apor Szentgy\u00f6rgyi (fl. 1341\u201360) ****Stephen II (fl. 1341\u201353) ****Egyed (fl. 1341\u201353) ****Nicholas (fl. 1341\u201353) **Lucas II (also Lucas the Great) ***Ladislaus Kust\u00e1ni (fl. 1274) ***Benedict Sz\u0151l\u0151si (fl. 1274) ***Lucas IV (?), see Ibr\u00e1nyi branch below ===Apponyi branch=== *Ivanka (fl. 1250) **Aladar (1294\u2020), first member of the \u0150ri (then Apponyi) family **Ladislaus (also Ladislaus of Hruss\u00f3; fl. 1295\u20131317), castellan of Privigye (today Prievidza, Slovakia; 1308) ** Peter I (fl. 1295) *** Michael (fl. 1317\u201326) *** Stephen (fl. 1317\u201326) *** Peter II (fl. 1323\u201324) ** John (fl. 1295\u20131333) ===Ibr\u00e1nyi branch=== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * ",
