    "text": "The Ministry of Culture, Information and Tourism of the Kyrgyz Republic is the ministry in charge of preservation and promotion of Kyrgyzstani culture in the republic and abroad. The ministry has its roots from the Soviet Union's Ministry of Culture, although the current ministry did not succeed directly from the Soviet ministry. Moreover there were no ministries or state committees for tourism in the Soviet Union, because tourists to and from non- communist countries were highly restricted and few in numbers. The ministry oversees various arts, cultural and historic sites in the republic, they include but are not limited to cinemas, circus, libraries, monuments, museums, musical institutions, parks, the National Cultural Center, the Philharmonic Hall and theaters. The ministry also oversees and regulates the republic's artists, as well as the education and promotion of Kyrgyz culture. ==Structure== The ministry is subdivided into three departments: ===Department of Cinematography=== This department is in charge of the regulation of the film industry in the Kyrgyz Republic as well as the promotion of the republic through films, some of which were showcased internationally.
