Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). == History == Daiichi Sankyo was established in 2005 through the merger of and , which were century- old pharmaceutical companies based in Japan. Sankyo Co., Ltd. was founded by Dr. Jokichi Takamine, who patented the isolation of adrenalin. Takamine was also the first president of Sankyo Co., Ltd from March 1913 \u2013 July 1922. === Kickbacks === Daiichi Sankyo is being \"closely monitored\" after settling charges concerning payment of remuneration to physicians in the form of speaker fees as part of company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, in violation of the False Claims Act, an anti-kickback statute. Daiichi Sankyo agreed to pay the United States and state Medicaid programs $39 million to settle allegations by the United States Department of Justice over kickbacks to doctors. As part of the company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, Daiichi Sankyo paid physicians improper kickbacks in the form of speaker fees to induce physicians to prescribe Daiichi drugs, including Azor, Benicar, Tribenzor and Welchol. Allegedly, payments were made to physicians even when physician participants in PODs took turns \u201cspeaking\u201d on duplicative topics over Daiichi-paid dinners, the recipient spoke only to members of his or her own staff in his or her own office, or the associated dinner was so lavish that its cost exceeded Daiichi's own internal cost limitation of $140 per person. \u201cSchemes such as this are particularly abhorrent,\u201d said Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cManufacturers and physicians who engage in them are cheating Medicare and Medicaid out of millions of dollars and threatening programs upon which many elderly and disabled Americans rely. My office will take whatever steps necessary to guard against improper alliances between manufacturers of drugs and those who prescribe them. Through our corporate integrity agreement we will be closely monitoring Daiichi.\u201d === Acquisitions === In 2006, Daiichi Sankyo acquired Zepharma, the OTC drugs unit of Astellas Pharma. On June 10, 2008, Daiichi Sankyo agreed to take a majority (64%) stake in Indian generic drug maker Ranbaxy, with a deal valued at about $4.6 billion.
