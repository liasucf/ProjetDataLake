The team had a subpar performance throughout the first three stages of the season, posting a 9\u201312 record through 21 matches with no stage playoff appearances. After the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the league, the Charge flourished, losing only one match in their final seven matches to give them a 15\u201313 record for the season. Finishing in 9th place in the overall standings, Guangzhou qualified for the Play-In Tournament, where they defeated the Chengdu Hunters in the first round, 4\u20131. However, they were unable to make it season playoffs, as they fell to the Seoul Dynasty by a score of 1\u20134 the following day. == Preceding offseason == Charge acquired Choi \"Hotba\" Hong-Jun from Philadelphia Fusion on 17 October. In mid-November, Charge announced nine more players signed for their inaugural roster: *Yiliang \"Eileen\" Ou, *Finley \"Kyb\" Adisi, *Lee \"Happy\" Jeong-woo, *Charlie \"nero\" Zwarg, *Oh \"Rio\" Seung-pyo, *Kim \"shu\" Jin-seo, *Kim \"Chara\" Jung-yeon, *Chen \"Onlywish\" Lizhen, and *Lee \"Rise\" Won-jae.

Guangzhou took both of their matches week three over Florida Mayhem and Los Angeles Valiant to bring their record to 3\u20132. After dropping their week four match to Los Angeles Gladiators, Charge's final match of the stage was a rematch against Titans. Needing a win to secure a spot in the Stage 1 Playoffs, Charge was swept by Titans, ending the stage with a 3\u20134 record and out of playoff contention. === Stage 2 === Charge could not find much success in Stage 2.

The match was riddled with little mistakes by the Charge; that, and their inability to change strategies throughout, led to a 1\u20133 loss. Looking to rebound from the two straight losses, the Charge next took on the Toronto Defiant on 22 June. The Charge took the first map, Ilios in convincing fashion and carried that momentum throughout the match to sweep Toronto 4\u20130.

In the first map, Lijiang Tower, New York managed to take a point, but ultimately lost the map; that point was the only point the Charge would yield in the entire match, as Guangzhou won 4\u20130 in one of the most lopsided matches in the history of the Overwatch League. For their final regular season match, the Charge took on the Dallas Fuel on 18 August.
