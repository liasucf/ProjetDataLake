    "text": "Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol\u00e1s is, in Catholicism, a title of veneration of the Virgin Mary associated with a reported private revelation to Gladys Quiroga de Motta, a middle-aged housewife, beginning in the 1980s in city of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Arroyos, Argentina. Quiroga said that she was tasked with promoting devotion to the Mother of God under this title, with an emphasis on key passages in the Bible and a particular mystical stellar symbolism. The devotional image, that of a standing Madonna offering rosary beads to the faithful, resembles that of Our Lady of Mount Carmel offering the scapular to St. Simon Stock, while differing from traditional Dominican Seat- of-Wisdom-type depictions of Our Lady of the Rosary popularized by the Order of Preachers. The pilgrimage site, named in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol\u00e1s erected in San Nicol\u00e1s de los Arroyos, is one of the most important in Argentina. == History == The parish church dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari was inaugurated in 1884 and furnished with a statue of Our Lady donated by a member of the local Confraternity of the Rosary. A century later an Argentinian lay woman Gladys Quiroga de Motta reportedly received a number of private revelations from the Virgin Mary beginning on 25 September 1983, a date now commemorated as the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol\u00e1s. Announced by unusually radiant, glowing rosary beads and followed by a number of brief visions, Gladys subsequently received repeated interior locutions beginning on October 13, the anniversary of apparitions at F\u00e1tima. Specific messages led to the discovery\u2014and restoration to veneration\u2014of a long-neglected statue of a Madonna carrying the Christ Child. Occurring at the close of the twentieth century,Diocesan approved apparition: San Nicolas messaged at MiracleHunter, an online catalog of the phenomena of Marian apparitions the messages mirror those given at the beginning of the twentieth century where the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as the Lady of the Rosary at F\u00e1tima in Portugal. Following approval of the spiritual merits by local religious authorities, a new church dedicated to Marian devotion under this title was erected as requested by Our Lady during the apparitions. === Chronology === San Nicol\u00e1s of the Arroyos, in Argentina * 1884: inauguration of the parish church of St. Nicholas of Bari and donation of a statue of Our Lady of the Rosary. * 1983 - September 25: in the city of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Arroyos, Gladys Quiroga de Motta, a mother of two daughters, with only a fourth-grade elementary education, reveals that during a supernatural experience she had seen, and heard from, an image that she did not recognize. ** September 28: second apparition appears to Gladys Motta, which she reveals in confidence to her family and neighbors ** October 7: after suffering an emotional block for some days, Gladys asks Our Lady in prayer what purpose the apparitions have and receives the vision of a church ** October: Gladys Quiroga confides what has transpired to her priest, Reverend Fr.
