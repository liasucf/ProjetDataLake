Beginning with Pearl Jam\u2019s groundbreaking \u201cOfficial Bootlegs\u201d series, artists who have appeared on recordings distributed exclusively by Basecamp include: Pearl Jam, Linkin Park,http://downloads.linkinpark.com/ Jay-Z, U2, DisturbedChris Cornell, Tori Amos, Ben Harper, The Black Crowes, The Cult, Busta Rhymes, Sleater-Kinney, Kings of Leon, Mudhoney, My Morning Jacket, Sonic Youth, Dispatch, Third Dayhttp://downloads.thirdday.com and Wolfmother. Basecamp works with artists who sell their shows through their own web sites. Shows are typically available anywhere from 30 minutes to a few days following the performance. Basecamp handles the whole process from recording the show, mixing it and then releases it through their own software package which is installed on the artists site. Basecamp also has partnerships with both Ticketmaster and Live Nation to sell the live recordings at the point of ticket purchase. Basecamp was acquired by Warner Music Group in 2009 and Mr. James is now the CEO of Zig Media.https://zig.com/thenewyorktimes/slideshows/graydon-carter-ex-editor-of- vanity-fair-invests-113432 == References== Category:Record label distributors ",
