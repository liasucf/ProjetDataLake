It lies near \u0160umperk. ==Etymology== The name of \"Bludov\" is derivered from the name of its probable founder Blud of Bludov. ==History== Bludov was established in the 13th century and was the only Czech village in the German \u0160umperk District. Bludov was a farming village during the medieval and early modern eras. Local historian Jan B\u0159ezina has speculated that gold was mined on Zlatn\u00edk Hill, but there is little historical evidence for this claim. Panning may have been done in Vitonick\u00fd Creek at Vl\u010d\u00ed D\u016fl. Blud of Bludov's son built the castle on the slope of the H\u00e1j Hill. The Bludov Castle was destroyed during the Bohemian\u2013Hungarian War. During the 16th century Bludov became the possession of a Zierotin noble, who built the Bludov Chateau. During the 15th century Bludov became a possession of Tunkl of Brn\u00ed\u010dko, who built six large ponds near the village. The pond were dried in the 19th century, because their maintenance did not pay off economically. During the second half of the 19th century, Bludov was industrialized with the construction of two mills, a sawmill, two textile workshops, an engineering works and a limekiln. At the beginning of the 20th century, the textile factories failed and a dairy, an iron-foundry and a distillery were established. In 1929 the Bludov Spa was opened. In 1963, the Vl\u010d\u00ed D\u016fl pool was opened. Small and medium-sized businesses were suppressed by the communist government during the 1950s, and the spa and dairy were nationalized. The head office of the farm collective was built opposite the Bludov Chateau, with concrete functionalist architecture. ==Economy== Granodiorit quarry During the 1970s the dairy was rebuilt as the Nealko, a soft-drink factory. Agrega, a factory repairing electric motors, was also established. Nealko and Agrega faced financial troubles after the Velvet Revolution, prompting Agrega to expand its services to repair injection pumps, alternators, starters and cars and sell Peugeot and Citroen cars and auto parts. Nealko produced an unsuccessful soft-drink brand, Mon\u00e1da. It then produced soft drinks for diabetics before going bankrupt at the beginning of the 21st century. In the Mohelnick\u00e1 Br\u00e1zda lowlands, corn, barley, wheat, oilseed rape, poppy, sugar beet, alfalfa and flax are grown and cattle and broilers raised. The Granodiorite quarry is located on the Chochol\u00edk Hill, where stone is processed into sand and a type of wollastonite known as Bludovit is sometimes mined. Bludovit is used decoratively, and its powder is used in blast furnaces. Bludov Spa is focused on treatment of obesity and musculoskeletal disorders. There is a small hydroelectric plant at Habermann's Mill. ==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities== Bludov is twinned with: * Lehota pod Vt\u00e1\u010dnikom, Slovakia ==See also== *Bludove\u010dek and Z\u00e1me\u010dek ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Villages in \u0160umperk District Category:Spa towns in the Czech Republic ",
