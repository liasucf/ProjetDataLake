K\u00f6then is the location of the main campus and the administrative centre of the regional university, Anhalt University of Applied Sciences/Hochschule Anhalt which is especially strong in information technology. The city is conveniently located at the hub of the Magdeburg\u2013Leipzig, Dessau\u2013K\u00f6then and K\u00f6then\u2013Aschersleben railways. K\u00f6then is situated in a fertile area with rich black soil suitable to the cultivation of sugar-beets. Industry includes high- tech engineering, manufacture of cranes, as well as chemicals, printing, and foodstuffs. In English, German place-name is often spelt anachronistically as C\u00f6then, a practice that has become standard in the literature relating to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who resided and worked there from 1717 to 1723. ==History== St. Jakob Owing to the fertile soil of the region, the area of K\u00f6then is unusually rich in archaeological discoveries. The earliest signs of human habitation date from the early Stone Age about 250,000 years ago and evidence of every succeeding historical period may be found in the collections of the local Prehistorical Museum. The first documentary mention of \"Cothene\" dates to 1115; by 1194 it was already known as a market town, becoming a seat of the princes of Anhalt. K\u00f6then was chartered in 1200. For over two centuries (1603\u20131847) it was the capital of the independent principality (from 1806, duchy) of Anhalt-K\u00f6then. The town has long been known to classical music enthusiasts as the place of origin of Johann Sebastian Bach's best-known secular works, including the Brandenburg concertos and the Well-Tempered Clavier. Bach worked in K\u00f6then from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold von Anhalt-K\u00f6then. It is also the birthplace of the composer Carl Friedrich Abel who, together with Johann Christian Bach, founded the popular \"Bach-Abel Concerts\" in London, the first subscription concerts in England. Schloss K\u00f6then has been fully restored except for a small side wing bombed in 1944. Its Hall of Mirrors where Bach's music is now often performed is a popular attraction. It can be seen on DVD in the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra's recording of the Brandenburg concertos. Since 1967 a bi- annual Bach Festival has been held at K\u00f6then, in the various halls of the palace as well as the local churches. Another concert hall was opened in 2008 in the palace complex. Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homoeopathy, practised in K\u00f6then from 1821 to 1834, and during this period he published many of his best-known works. In 1855 his disciple Arthur Lutze opened a palatial homoeopathic clinic. Hahnemann's home is now open to tourists, and includes an actual working homoeopathic practice. The city has become the national center of homeopathy, location of congresses, and the seat of the new European Homeopathic Library. In 2013, the international homoeopathic medical society, Liga Medicorum Homoeopathica Internationalis, relocated its main operations to K\u00f6then, so the city now is kind of a \"world's capital of homoeopathy\". The pioneering ornithologist Johann Friedrich Naumann was born near K\u00f6then and was employed at the ducal court for more than two decades (c. 1810-1835). His well-renowned collection of almost 1300 specimen and drawings of European birds is now the main part of an ornithological museum that is also situated in the palace. ==Geography== The tower guarding the southern gate (to Halle) was built in the 15th century and renovated in 1995 ===Location=== K\u00f6then located to the south of Magdeburg, north of Halle, west of Dessau and east of Bernburg (Saale).
