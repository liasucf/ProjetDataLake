    "text": "Concrete Rose is the third studio album by American singer Ashanti. It was released by The Inc. Records and Def Jam Recordings on December 14, 2004 in the United States. In addition to working with frequent collaborators Irv Gotti, Chink Santana, and 7 Aurelius, Ashanti also enlisted new collaborators Malcolm Flythe, Jimi Kendrix, and Demi-Doc, to assist. The album features features guest appearance from rappers T.I., Ja Rule, and Lloyd. Concrete Rose was proceeded by lead single \"Only U\", which received positive reviews and reached the top-twenty in several countries. The album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 in the United States, with first-week sales of 254,000 units; the album also became Ashanti's third consecutive album to top the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. Outside the United States, the album was less successful, with its most strongest ranking being in the top thirty of the UK Albums Chart. Critical reception to the project was mixed, with most deeming the album as unoriginal. Nonetheless, the album did receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and gained gold status in Japan and the United Kingdom. The album and its promotion was vastly overshadowed by the legal troubles that faced The Inc. and Gotti, who was arrested on money laundering charges only a month after Concrete Roses release. As a result, Def Jam severed ties with The Inc. in May 2005, and refused to promote the album's second single \"Don't Let Them\", which only charted moderately in Ireland and the United Kingdom. == Background == Following the success of her sophomore studio album Chapter II, Ashanti confirmed in November 2003 that she had begun planning her third studio album, due to be out in mid-2004. In February 2004, Ashanti said the album had \"a new sound, a new flavor\", and said she wanted \"to touch on more topics that I didn't touch on with the first and the second record.\" She also confirmed that she had already recorded three songs for the album. By July, Ashanti confirmed she had already finished the record, and planned its release for November. == Singles and promotion == The song \"Turn It Up\", featuring rapper Ja Rule, was initially released as the lead single off the album. However, it was downscaled to a buzz single after The Inc. decided to release \"Only U\" as Concrete Roses lead single instead. The song, released on October 26, 2004, reached the top ten of several countries, including Ireland (#4), Japan (#), and the United Kingdom (#2); the song also reached the top twenty in Germany (#12), New Zealand (#14), Switzerland (#12), and the United States (#13). The album was largely overshadowed by the legal issues surrounding Murder Inc./The Inc. and its head, Irv Gotti. In January 2003, during recording of Chapter II, the offices Murder Inc. were raided during an investigation into Gotti's ties to gangster Kenneth McGriff. In November, Murder Inc. changed its name to The Inc., in an attempt to distance the company from its several controversies. Between November 2004 and January 2005, Gotti, McGriff, and several employees and associates of The Inc. were arrested on charges of money laundering, racketeering, and murder, regarding to the killing of rapper E-Money Bags. In April 2005, Ashanti chose \"Don't Let Them\" to be the second single from the album. However, in May, Def Jam dissolved its partnership with The Inc., and refused to promote the single or give it a music video. As a result, the single failed to chart in the United States; however, the single did chart moderately in Ireland (#41) and the United Kingdom (#38). == Critical reception == Concrete Rose received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 47, based on 10 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average\" reviews. Andy Kellman from Allmusic found that \"disregarding the ill-suited standards, an Ashanti album is always good for a handful of strong singles, as Concrete Rose helps indicate [...] it's no better or worse than her 2002 debut or 2003's Chapter II, with the standout singles, decent album cuts, and filler fluff provided in equal doses.\" USA Today journalist Steve Jones found that with Concrete Rose Ashanti \"sticks closely to her usual formula of engaging beats and airy vocals [...] Still, she is consistent enough to make this Rose bloom full time.\" Nicholas Tayor from PopMatters called the album \"a decent, 54-minute collection of mostly mid-tempo tracks by a decent R&B; singer.\" Billboard noted that \"a more confident-sounding Ashanti is onboard for her third time out. Powered by sensual lead single \"Only You,\" Concrete Rose contains several other equally rhythmic jams.\" Hattie Collins, writing for The Guardian, found that \"Ashanti doesn't stray from the R&B; rulebook that has so far seen her sell some 7m albums in the US alone \u2013 namely a hip-hop backdrop of hard-knock beats tempered by a soul-lite vocal [...] A lack of originality and too much filler mark Ashanti more as a pedestrian than the princess she purports to be.\" Steve Appleford from The Los Angeles Times wrote that Ashanti and Concrete Rose sound \"trapped, sapped of strength and ideas, and buried beneath all the worst cold and calculated production tendencies of her label [...] What follows is modern R&B; formula at its most flat and uninspired. For all her lovesick panting, pleading and purring, Ashanti is never emotionally engaged with the songs, which aren\u2019t worth the trouble anyway.\" Entertainment Weeklys Raymond Fiore remarked that \"the thin-voiced vixen\u2019s third disc bruises both genres with a slew of mostly midtempo clunkers built with her weapons of choice: faux grit and forced sensuality.\" In his review for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani wrote: \"Ashanti is incapable of doing slinky or sexy and, despite her incessant attempts at vamping, she can\u2019t all-out sing either \u2013 she\u2019s even upstaged by a Hammond organ.\" == Chart performance == Concrete Rose debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 album chart in December 2004 and Billboard's Top R&B;/Hip Hop Albums chart at number one with first-week sales of 254,000 units sold. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on January 14, 2005 and remained on the Billboard 200 albums chart for 20 weeks. The album has sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. to date, as of October 2005.https://web.archive.org/web/20051026071421/http://www.memorylanemusicgroup.com/ Outside the United States the album debuted or peaked at #25 in the United Kingdom, #98 in France, #35 in Germany and #66 in Switzerland. == Track listing == === Samples === * \"Message to the Fans (Skit)\" contains a sample of \"Why You Treat Me So Bad\" by Club Nouveau, written by Denzil Foster, Jay King, and Thomas McElroy. * \"Don't Let Them\" contains a sample of \"Heaven & Hell\" by Raekwon featuring Ghostface Killah, written by Dennis Coles and Corey Woods, which itself samples \"Could I Be Falling In Love\" by Syl Johnson, written by Willie Mitchell, Yvonne Mitchell, Earl Randle, and Lawrence Seymour. * \"Love Again\" contains a sample of \"Fuck Faces\" by Scarface featuring Too Short, Tela, & Devin the Dude, and written by Devin Copeland, Mike Dean, Brad Jordan, Winston Rogers, and Todd Shaw. * \"U\" contains an interpolation of \"Freek'n You (Mr. Dalvin's Freek Remix)\" by Jodeci featuring Raekwon and Ghostface Killah, written by Donald DeGrate. * \"Turn It Up\" contains a sample of \"Short Eyes\", written and performed by Curtis Mayfield. == Personnel == * 7 Aurelius \u2013 vocals, background vocals, producer, associate executive producer, instrumentation * Won \"Engineer to the Stars\" Bee Allen \u2013 engineer * Chuck Amos \u2013 hair stylist * David Ashton \u2013 engineer * Ashaunna Ayars \u2013 marketing * Jerry Barnes \u2013 bass guitar * William Barnes \u2013 guitar * Erica Bowen \u2013 recording director * Milwaukee \"Protools King\" Buck \u2013 engineer * Al \"Boogie\" Carty \u2013 bass * Robin Clark \u2013 executive assistant * Tom Coyne \u2013 mastering * Kenneth Crouch \u2013 keyboards * Ashanti Douglas \u2013 executive producer * Tinya Y.
