    "text": "The Women with Disabilities Feminist Collective (WDFC) was an Australian social support organization for women with disabilities, which engaged in feminist political action in the 1980s. Lesley Hall was one of the founders. One of its earliest actions was to protest the Miss Australia Quest, a beauty contest which raised money for what was then known as the Spastic Society. The WDFC objected to the contest's focus on physical perfection \"as the norm all must maintain if they are to be fully accepted into society\". The group disrupted the 1982 Miss Victoria contest, invading the stage with a banner reading \"Equality Not Charity\". ==References== Category:Feminist organisations in Australia Category:Disability organisations based in Australia ",
