    "text": "Bridgefy is a software company based in California, USA, dedicated to developing mesh-networking technology for mobile apps. It was founded circa 2014 by Jorge Rios, after conceiving the idea while participating in a tech competition called StartupBus. Bridgefy's smartphone ad hoc network technology, apparently using Bluetooth Mesh, is licensed to other apps. The app gained popularity during protests in different countries since it can operate without Internet, using Bluetooth instead. However, all communications are insecure, since it does not use cryptography at all and anyone can trivially intercept, read, and modify any information sent via the app. ==Usage== The app gained popularity as a communication tactic during the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests and Citizenship Amendment Act protests in India, because it requires people who want to intercept the message to be physically close because of Bluetooth's limited range, and the ability to daisy-chain devices to send messages further than Bluetooth's range. == Security == In August 2020, researchers published a paper describing numerous attacks against the application, which allow de-anonymizing users, building social graphs of users\u2019 interactions (both in real time and after the fact), decrypting and reading direct messages, impersonating users to anyone else on the network, completely shutting down the network, performing active man-in-the-middle attacks to read messages and even modify them. In response to the disclosures, developers acknowledged that \"no part of the Bridgefy app is encrypted now\" and gave a vague promise to release a new version \"encrypted with top security protocols\". Later developers said they plan to switch to Signal protocol, which is widely recognized by cryptographers and used by Signal and WhatsApp. It's still unclear how Bridgefly intends to use the protocol, since it is not federated and does not solve the problem of initial public key exchange. ==See also== *Signal protocol, which developers intend to use to correct the security problems. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Social media Category:2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests Category:IOS Category:Android (operating system) Category:Information technology companies of Mexico Category:Companies based in Mexico City Category:Mexican companies established in 2016 Category:Technology companies established in 2016 Category:Mesh networking ",
