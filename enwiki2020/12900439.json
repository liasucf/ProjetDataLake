The steam generators were made by Babcock & Wilcox of Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. ;Phase III: Involved construction of two 728 MW (gross) CANDU-6 series of the CANDU reactor design supplied by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. This was reported to be the largest business venture between Canada and China to that time. In 2001, it was visited by the Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien; both units were online by 2003. Although Fangjiashan Nuclear Power Plant is technically a separate entity from Qinshan, the World Nuclear Association considers it to essentially be an extension of the Qinshan plant due to their proximity and the fact that the original two reactors built at Fangjiashan were initially intended to be built at Qinshan phase IV (which is no longer planned). ==Reactor data== {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Reactors |- !
