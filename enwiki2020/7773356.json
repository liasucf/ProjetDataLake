    "text": "Valley River Center is a super-regional-class shopping mall located in Eugene, Oregon, U.S. It is the largest shopping center between Portland and Sacramento. The mall features over 90 local and national stores and restaurants. Anchor stores include JCPenney, Macy's, Regal Cinemas, and Round One Entertainment. Located on the banks of the Willamette River, the mall is easily accessible by bike and walking paths. Also located near the mall is the Valley River Inn. The mall opened in 1969 with JCPenney, Meier & Frank, Montgomery Ward, and The Bon March\u00e9 as the original anchors. In 2001, Montgomery Ward closed its doors, eventually replacing it with Regal Cinemas. In 2003, The Bon March\u00e9 operated as Bon-Macy's until 2005 when it fully changed to Macy's. In 2006, The Macerich Company, the firm managing the property, purchased the property from the previous owner, Grosvenor. In that same year, Macy's moved from the smaller Bon March\u00e9 building into the bigger Meier & Frank building, selling its original location to Gottschalks, which opened a year later. On March 12, 2019 it was announced that Round One Entertainment would be opening an amusement center in the former Gottschalks anchor building sometime in late 2019. ==In popular culture== In 1979, parts of the movie How to Beat the High Co$t of Living were filmed here. ==See also== *List of shopping malls in Oregon ==References== ==External links== *Valley River Center - Official website Category:Shopping malls in Oregon Category:Shopping malls established in 1969 Category:Buildings and structures in Eugene, Oregon Category:Tourist attractions in Eugene, Oregon Category:1969 establishments in Oregon ",
