    "text": "Saving Humanity:Truly Understanding And Ranking Our World's Greatest Threats is a book written by Hu Jiaqi. The book designs the ideal framework of a harmonious society and a harmonious world. It discusses the two sides of the development of science and technology, the uncontrollability of the development of science and technology, and how to deal with the rapid technological advancement. ==Overview== Saving Humanity was first published in 2018 by Friesen Press. In the book, Hu Jiaqi argues that mankind faces threats in many respects, including terrorism, pandemics, wars, and ecological disasters. It proposes that human beings will not be extinct by those threats. Instead, the chief culprit of human extinction is technology. If technology continues to develop, human beings could disappear from the earth in less than two or three hundred years. To avoid the extinction crisis, the development of science and technology must be checked and restricted, and a world government should be established. ==References== Category:Chinese-language books Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:2018 non-fiction books ",
