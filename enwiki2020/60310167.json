    "text": "Concerning Miss Marlowe is an American daytime television serial that was broadcast on NBC from July 5, 1954, until July 1, 1955. ==Plot== The title character was 40-year-old Maggie Marlowe, whose husband succumbed to pneumonia shortly before the birth of their daughter. The impoverished mother allowed her in-laws to take the child to raise. Returning to her acting career, she fell in love with a married man and tried to restore relations with her estranged daughter. By April 1955, Marlowe was no longer an actress; she had become \"a middleclass house frau with a tacky smock and a worry for every gray hair in her little head.\" ==Sponsor and promotion== Procter & Gamble initially sponsored the program \"on an alternate-day basis\". In September 1955, the company held a Talent Discovery contest with the show's star, director, and producer as judges. Miles Laboratories became a sponsor in the fall of 1954. The serial originated at WNBT-TV in New York City. It was replaced by It Pays to Be Married. ==Personnel== Characters in Concerning Miss Marlowe and the actors and actresses who portrayed them are shown in the table below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
