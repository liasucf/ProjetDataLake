    "text": "Eastleigh L.F.C. is an English women's football club affiliated with Eastleigh Football Club based in Eastleigh, Hampshire. They currently compete in the Southern Region Women's Football League First Southern, following back-to-back promotions from the Hampshire County Women's Football League Division One, and the Southern Region Women's Football League Division 1. ==History== Originally formed in 2007, Eastleigh Ladies joined the Hampshire County Women's Football League in its third season. For the 2007\u201308 season, the club was admitted into Division Two of the Hampshire County Women's League, and won promotion to the Hampshire County Women's League Division One after finishing as champions ahead of 2nd-placed Rushmoor Community in its inaugural season. The following two seasons saw the Spitfires finish in a respectable 4th place in Division One. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Eastleigh were crowned champions for the second time since the clubs' inception back in 2007, beating QK Southampton Ladies to the Division title with only three points separating both teams. However the next season brought about the end of the women's side due to a lack of facilities which saw the team disband. ==Re-founding== The team was re-founded in 2016 and won both the Hampshire County Women's Football League Division One championship, and the Southern Region Women's Football League Division 1 championship in its first two seasons. ==Squad== ==Honours== ===Regional=== * Hampshire County Women's Football League Division Two: ** Winners (1): 2007\u201308 * Hampshire County Women's Football League Division One: **Winners (1): 2010\u201311 **Runners-up (1): 2016\u201317 *Hampshire County Women's Football League Cup **Runners-up (1): 2016\u201317 ==References== ==External links== *Eastleigh Ladies F.C. at Eastleigh F.C. *Unofficial fanzine of Eastleigh Ladies F.C. at TSSC Category:Women's football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in Hampshire Category:Association football clubs established in 2007 Category:Eastleigh F.C.
