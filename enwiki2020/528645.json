The Society of Professional Journalists awarded Scheer the 2011 Sigma Delta Chi Award for his column.2011 Sigma Delta Chi winners ==Early life== Scheer was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City. His mother, Ida Kuran, was a Russian Jew, and his father, Frederick Scheer, was a Protestant native of Germany; both worked in the garment industry. Robert graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx. After graduating from City College of New York with a degree in economics, he studied as a fellow at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, and then did further economics graduate work at the Center for Chinese Studies at UC Berkeley. Scheer has also been a Poynter fellow at Yale University,http://annenberg.usc.edu/Faculty/Communication%20and%20Journalism/ScheerR.aspx and was a fellow in arms control at Stanford University, the same post once held by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.http://www.truthdig.com/staff/robert_scheer ==The Ramparts years== In 1962Some sources say that Root and Branch was started in 1960 or 1959. Some sources say that it began as \"an offshoot of SLATE\" (a leftist student political party at UC Berkeley). in Berkeley, California, Scheer along with David Horowitz, Maurice Zeitlin, Phil Roos, and Sol Stern founded Root and Branch: A Radical Quarterly, one of the earliest campus New Left journals. While working at City Lights Books in San Francisco, Scheer co-authored Cuba, an American Tragedy (1964) with Maurice Zeitlin. Between 1964 and 1969, he served, variously, as the Vietnam correspondent, managing editor, and editor- in-chief of Ramparts magazine in San Francisco. Scheer reported from Cambodia, China, North Korea, Russia, Latin America and the Middle East (including the Six-Day War), as well as on national security matters in the United States. While in Cuba, where he interviewed Fidel Castro, Scheer obtained an introduction by the Cuban leader for the diary of Che Guevara \u2014 which Scheer had already obtained, with the help of French journalist Michele Ray, for publication in Ramparts and by Bantam Books. After Ramparts collapsed, Scheer became a freelance writer who was published in major magazines including Playboy, Look, Esquire, Lear's and Cosmopolitan. ==Congressional Run== In the late 1960s, Scheer made a bid for elective office as an anti-Vietnam War candidate. He challenged U.S. Representative Jeffrey Cohelan in the 1966 Democratic primary. Cohelan was a liberal, but like most Democratic officeholders at that time, he supported the Vietnam War. Scheer lost, but won over 45% of the vote (and carried Berkeley), a strong enough showing against an incumbent to represent an indicator of the strength of New Left Sixties radicalism. In 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the Vietnam War.\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 New York Post In July 1970, Scheer accompanied as a journalist a Black Panther Party delegation, led by Eldridge Cleaver, who also wrote for Ramparts, to North Korea, China, and Vietnam. The delegation also contained people from the San Francisco Red Guard, the women's liberation movement, the Peace and Freedom Party, Newsreel, and the Movement for a Democratic Military. In the November 1970 California elections, Scheer ran for the U.S. Senate as the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party against Republican Senator George Murphy and Democratic Congressman John V. Tunney. Scheer received 56,731 votes and lost the election to Tunney.http://www.peaceandfreedom.org/home/about- us/historical-information/us-senate-candidates ==Los Angeles Times and Public Radio== After several years freelancing for magazines, including New Times and Playboy, Scheer joined the Los Angeles Times in 1976 as a reporter. There he met Narda Zacchino, a reporter whom he later married in the paper's news room. As a national correspondent for 17 years at the LA Times, he wrote articles and series on diverse topics such as the Soviet Union during glasnost, the Jews of Los Angeles, arms control, urban crises, national politics and the military, and covered several presidential elections. The LA Times entered Scheer's work for the Pulitzer Prize 11 times, and he was a finalist for the Pulitzer national reporting award for a series on the television industry. After Scheer left the LA Times in 1993, the paper granted him a weekly op-ed column which ran every Tuesday for the next 12 years until it was canceled in 2005. The column now appears in Truthdig and is distributed nationally by Creators Syndicate. Scheer is also a contributing editor for The Nation magazine. He was heard weekly on the nationally syndicated political analysis radio program Left, Right & Center, produced at and syndicated by public radio station KCRW in Santa Monica, and is a host of Scheer Intelligence, a half- hour KCRW podcast with politically engaged individuals. Scheer has taught courses at Antioch College, City College of New York, UC Irvine, UCLA and UC Berkeley, and is now a clinical professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication, where he teaches two courses each semester on media and society. Scheer interviewed every president from Richard Nixon through Bill Clinton. He conducted the 1976 Playboy interview with Jimmy Carter, in which the then-presidential candidate admitted to having \"lusted\" in his heart.Scheer, Robert, In an interview with George H.W. Bush, the then presidential candidate revealed that he believed nuclear war was \"winnable.\" Scheer has profiled politicians from Californians Jerry Brown and Willie Brown to Washington insiders like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, and figures like actor Tom Cruise. ==Political views== ===Iraq War=== In an August 6, 2002 article, he wrote that \"a consensus of experts\" informed the Senate that the Iraqi weapons arsenal was \"almost totally destroyed during eight years of inspections.\" On June 3, 2003, Scheer concluded that White House justifications for the war were a \"big lie.\" On November 4, 2003, he penned an article in favor of withdrawal from Iraq. ===World War II=== In an April 7, 2010 article, he wrote that Harry Truman perpetrated \"the most atrocious act of terrorism in world history when he annihilated the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" Scheer has repeated this assertion on the radio program Left, Right & Center. ===2010 support of Kentucky Republican for U.S. Senate=== In the October 1, 2010 episode of the radio show Left, Right and Center, Scheer, a self-described left-liberal, expressed support for Republican Rand Paul, son of former Libertarian presidential candidate and Republican congressman Ron Paul, in his United States Senate campaign in Kentucky. ==End of Los Angeles Times relationship== Scheer has often expressed highly controversial ideas. In a February 15, 2005 LA Times article entitled \"What We Don't Know About 9/11 Hurts Us\", he stated: \"Would George W. Bush have been reelected president if the public understood how much responsibility his administration bears for allowing the 9/11 attacks to succeed?\" After running his column for more than 12 years after he had worked as a reporter for the paper 17 years, the Los Angeles Times ended a nearly 30-year relationship with Scheer in November 2005, citing the need to cut costs, but subsequently replaced him with two conservative columnists. Scheer said in an interview with Democracy Now! that the paper's owner, the Tribune Company, owns a newspaper and a television station in the same market, which is illegal, and may have fired Scheer in an attempt to make it easier to obtain a waiver permitting the dual ownership from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He also commented during a November 14, 2005, appearance on Democracy Now!: > What happened is that I had been the subject of vicious attacks by Bill > O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. ... I was a punching bag for those guys. I'm > still standing, and the people who run the paper collapsed. In a posting on The Huffington Post, Scheer wrote: > The publisher Jeff Johnson, who has offered not a word of explanation to me, > has privately told people that he hated every word that I wrote. I assume > that mostly refers to my exposing the lies used by President Bush to justify > the invasion of Iraq. Fortunately 60 percent of Americans now get the point > but only after tens of thousand of Americans and Iraqis have been killed and > maimed as the carnage spirals out of control. My only regret is that my pen > was not sharper and my words tougher. Scheer's firing incited a protest held outside the LA Times downtown office on November 15, and hundreds of readers wrote letters of complaint while some, including Barbra Streisand, publicly announced the cancellation of their LA Times subscriptions. Within a few days of his column being retired by the Times, the San Francisco Chronicle offered itself as the new home paper of Scheer's syndicated column, which ran there for years. ==Truthdig== On November 29, 2005 Scheer co-launched, as Editor in Chief, the online news magazine Truthdig, where his column is now based. Scheer's column is syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate in publications such as The Huffington Post and The Nation. In a 2014 Los Angeles Magazine feature about Truthdig, Ed Leibowitz writes \"The columnists and bloggers [of Truthdig] chart an ecosystem in irreversible decline, follow human rights crises and repression overseas, and probe the erosion of American democracy by perpetual war, the disappearance of privacy rights, the abandonment of the poor, and a political system in thrall to corporate titans, gross polluters, and Wall Street crooks.
