    "text": "Christopher Plys (; born August 13, 1987) is an American curler from Duluth, Minnesota. He is a Junior World Champion and two-time National Men's Champion. He was the alternate for the United States men's team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. ==Curling career== Plys started curling in 1998, at the age of eleven. He competed at seven Junior National Championships in a row, winning five of them, including four in a row as skip to finish his junior career. This gives him more junior national titles as skip than any other junior male. As US Champion he competed at four World Junior Championships. In his first, 2006, Plys took ninth place in Jeonju, South Korea. The next year, in 2007, he took fifth place in Eveleth, Minnesota. And finally in 2008, Plys won the gold medal in Ostersund, Sweden. At his final Junior Worlds in 2009 he again medaled, taking the bronze. Plys also competed at the World University Games in 2007, in Pinerolo, Italy, playing second on John Shuster's gold medal team. Early in his men's career Plys was twice invited to be alternate on Shuster's team at international events, at the World Championship in 2009 and the 2010 Winter Olympics. At the Olympics he was called in to skip the team (in place of Shuster) during draw 6 after the US team suffered four losses in a row, and led the team to a 4\u20133 victory over France after a 10th end steal. Following the Olympics, Plys was drafted onto Tyler George's team, where he threw third rocks (and sometimes fourth). The George team finished as runners-up in the 2011 and 2013 national championships. In 2014, Plys moved to third on Heath McCormick's team, which placed third in the 2014 and 2015 national championships, and second in both the 2017 Olympic Trials (to Shuster) and 2018 national championships. After winning gold at the 2018 Olympics, Tyler George, who had moved to Shuster's team, took a hiatus from curling and Plys replaced him at third. Team Shuster then won the 2019 national championships and represented the US at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship, where they finished in fifth place. They defended their United States title at the 2020 United States Men's Championship, defeating Rich Ruohonen in the final to finish the tournament undefeated. The national title would have earned Team Shuster a spot at the final Grand Slam of the season, the Champions Cup, as well as the chance to represent the United States at the 2020 World Men's Curling Championship, but both events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their Champions Cup qualification will instead carry over to the 2021 Champions Cup. ==Personal life== Plys works as a manager at a food commodity business.2019 Continental Cup Media Guide: Team Shuster ==Teams== ===Men's=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Season ! scope=\"col\"| Skip ! scope=\"col\"| Third ! scope=\"col\"| Second ! scope=\"col\"| Lead ! scope=\"col\"| Alternate ! scope=\"col\"|Coach ! scope=\"col\"| Events |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2002\u201303 | Jesse Gates || Jeff Thune || Kevin Johnson || Shane McKinlay || Chris Plys || Larry Barott || 2003 USJCC |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2003\u201304 | Chris Plys || Aanders Brorson || Kyle Coldagelli || Carl Ball || Matt Zbylut || Seppo Sormunen || 2004 USJCC (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2004\u201305 | Aanders Brorson || Chris Plys || Mark Moore || Grant Rahn || Ryan Brown || Kent Brorson || 2005 USJCC (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2005\u201306 | Chris Plys || Matt Mielke || Kevin Johnson || Tommy Kent || Aaron Wald || || 2006 USJCC (9th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2006\u201307 | Chris Plys || Aanders Brorson || Matt Perushek || Joel Cooper || || || 2007 USJCC (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 2007\u201308 | Chris Plys || Aanders Brorson || Matt Perushek || Matt Hamilton || || || 2008 USJCC |- | John Shuster || Jeff Isaacson || Chris Plys || Shane McKinlay || Jason Smith || || (6th) |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 2008\u201309 | Chris Plys || Aanders Brorson || Matt Perushek || Matt Hamilton || || || 2009 USJCC 2009 USOCT (8th) |- | John Shuster || Jason Smith || Jeff Isaacson ||John Benton || Chris Plys || Brian Simonson || (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2009\u201310 | John Shuster || Jason Smith || Jeff Isaacson || John Benton || Chris Plys || || 2010 OG (10th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2010\u201311 | Tyler George || Chris Plys || Rich Ruohonen || Phill Drobnick || || || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2011\u201312 | Tyler George || Chris Plys || Rich Ruohonen ||Colin Hufman || || || (8th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2012\u201313 | Chris Plys (Fourth) || Tyler George (Skip) || Rich Ruohonen || Colin Hufman || || || |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 2013\u201314 | Chris Plys (Fourth) || Tyler George (Skip) || Rich Ruohonen || Colin Hufman || Craig Brown || || 2013 USOCT (4th) |- | Heath McCormick || Chris Plys || Rich Ruohonen || Colin Hufman || || || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315 | Heath McCormick || Chris Plys ||Joe Polo || Colin Hufman ||Ryan Brunt || || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2015\u201316 | Chris Plys (Fourth) ||Pete Fenson (Skip) || Joe Polo || Jason Smith || || || (7th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2016\u201317 | Heath McCormick || Chris Plys ||Korey Dropkin || Tom Howell || || || (6th) |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| 2017\u201318 | Heath McCormick || Chris Plys || Korey Dropkin || Tom Howell || Rich Ruohonen (USOCT) || || 2017 USOCT (2nd) |- | Greg Persinger (Fourth) || Rich Ruohonen (Skip) || Colin Hufman || Philip Tilker || Chris Plys || Phill Drobnick || (6th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2018\u201319 | John Shuster || Chris Plys || Matt Hamilton ||John Landsteiner || || || (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2019\u201320 | John Shuster || Chris Plys || Matt Hamilton || John Landsteiner || || || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2020\u201321 | John Shuster || Chris Plys || Matt Hamilton || John Landsteiner || || || |} ===Mixed doubles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Season ! scope=\"col\"| Male ! scope=\"col\"| Female ! scope=\"col\"| Events |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2016\u201317 | Chris Plys || Aileen Geving || (12th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318 | Chris Plys || Aileen Geving || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2018\u201319 | Chris Plys || Vicky Persinger || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2019\u201320 | Chris Plys || Vicky Persinger || (5th) |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2020\u201321 | Chris Plys || Vicky Persinger || |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:American male curlers Category:Olympic curlers of the United States Category:Curlers at the 2010 Winter Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Duluth, Minnesota Category:Medalists at the 2007 Winter Universiade Category:Continental Cup of Curling participants Category:Universiade medalists in curling Category:American curling champions Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Competitors at the 2007 Winter Universiade ",
