    "text": "Tilia japonica, the Japanese lime or Japanese linden, is a species of Tilia native to eastern China and Japan, preferring to grow in mountains up to 2000m. It superficially resembles the better-known Tilia cordata, the small- leaved lime, and was originally described as Tilia cordata var. japonica. It differs from T. cordata in having 164 chromosomes instead of 82, and by some subtle differences in leaf and flower morphology. T. japonica inflorescences consistently have 5 staminodes, which is a reliable trait distinguishing it from T. cordata and T. amurensis. ==Cultivation and uses== Tilia japonica is grown as an ornamental tree, and when in flower has a more pleasing aroma than T. cordata. Its 'Ernest Wilson' cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Its wood was used for furniture, and due to its fine straight grain is still occasionally used for veneers. Like other lindens, it is a source for a superior honey. It is the official tree of the city of Nagano, Japan. ==References== japonica Category:Trees of China Category:Trees of Japan Category:Plants described in 1888 ",
