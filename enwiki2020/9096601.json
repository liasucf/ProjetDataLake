    "text": "ICC World Cricket League Division Three forms part of the World Cricket League (WCL) system. Like all other divisions, WCL Division Three is contested as a standalone tournament rather than as an actual league. The inaugural Division Three tournament was held in 2007, and featured eight teams. All subsequent editions have featured six teams. Because the WCL operates on a system of promotion and relegation, teams have generally only participated in one or two Division Three tournaments before either being promoted to Division Two or relegated to Division Four. Overall, 18 teams have featured in a Division Three tournament. Uganda has qualified for the division on six out of the seven occasions it has been held, while the United States has qualified on five occasions. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=2 width=10%|Year ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Host(s) ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Venue(s) ! colspan=3|Final |- ! width=18%|Winner ! width=24%|Result ! width=18%|Runner-up |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2007 | | Darwin | 241/8 (50 overs) | Uganda won by 91 runs scorecard | 150 (46.3 overs) |- | 2009 | | Buenos Aires | +0.971 NRR | Afghanistan won on net run rate table | +0.768 NRR |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2011 | | Hong Kong | 207/6 (47.1 overs) | Hong Kong won by 4 wickets scorecard | 202/9 (50 overs) |- | 2013 | | various | 153/5 (39.2 overs) | Nepal won by 5 wickets scorecard | 151/8 (50 overs) |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2014 | | Kuala Lumpur | 223 (49.5 overs) | Nepal won by 62 runs scorecard | 161 (44.1 overs) |- | 2017 | | various | 50/2 (4.3 overs) | No result Oman won by finishing higher in the group stage scorecard | 176/3 (38 overs) |- | 2018 | | various | |No final Oman finished top of the table | |} ==Performance by team== ;Legend * \u2013 Champions * \u2013 Runners-up * \u2013 Third place *Q \u2013 Qualified * -- Hosts * Sus- Suspended and withdrew {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" ! width=150|Team ! 2007 ! 2009 ! 2011 ! 2013 ! 2014 ! 2017 ! 2018 !
