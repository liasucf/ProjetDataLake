    "text": "The Night Flight Orchestra is a Swedish hard rock band from Helsingborg. They are signed to Nuclear Blast records. Formed in 2007 by Bj\u00f6rn Strid and David Andersson while they were touring in the US with their band Soilwork, they were later joined by bassist Sharlee D'Angelo (Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars, ex-Mercyful Fate), Richard Larsson (Von Benzo), Jonas K\u00e4llsb\u00e4ck (Mean Streak) and, more recently, Sebastian Forslund (Kadwatha). They have released five studio albums. The Night Flight Orchestra on stage in Paris during the Sometimes The World Ain't Enough European tour.

Bj\u00f6rn and David were bonding over what they considered \"classic\" or not, from rock n roll conspiracies to being arrested in a lobby with nothing but leather pants on. All those scenarios, fictional or real, needed a soundtrack. It didn't take long before bass player Sharlee D'Angelo (Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars) joined forces as well as keyboard player Richard Larsson (Von Benzo) and drummer Jonas K\u00e4llsb\u00e4ck (Mean Streak). Their goal was to reclaim the 70's/early 80's sense for classic melody. They released their first album Internal Affairs on 18 June 2012 through the Italian label Coroner Records and made their live debut on 1 August 2013 at Dina-scenen in Lidk\u00f6ping, Sweden. Due to their busy schedules with both Soilwork and Arch Enemy, they could only manage to play live for the first time one year after the release of Internal Affairs and only did a handful of concerts between 2013 and 2014 including a show at Sweden Rock Festival in 2014. === Skyline Whispers (2015) === In January 2015, The Night Flight Orchestra announced a new album release on 9 June 2015 via Coroner Records, and the addition of Sebastian Forslund (Kadawatha) on congas, percussion and guitar. Skyline Whispers was recorded at Nordic Sound Lab Studios, Skara (Sweden), engineered by The Night Flight Orchestra and Bengan Andersson, mixed by Sebastian Forslund and mastered by Thomas Plec Johansson at Panic Room Studios, Skara (Sweden). === Amber Galactic (2017) === The band signed to Nuclear Blast Records in 2016. Their third album, Amber Galactic was released on 19 May 2017. The Night Flight Orchestra did their first European tour as a headline show in late 2017. On 15 December 2017, The Night Flight Orchestra have been nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award in the category Best rock/Metal for their globally acclaimed album, Amber Galactic. === Sometimes The World Ain't Enough (2018) === Less than one week after the release of Amber Galactic, singer Bj\u00f6rn Strid stated in an interview that The Night Flight Orchestra were likely to start recording their fourth album a couple months later, during Summer 2017, to be released in Spring 2018. On 5 April 2018, The Night Flight Orchestra announced that their new album Sometimes the World Ain't Enough was due to release on 29 June 2018. The same day, the band announced a European tour supporting the album in November and December 2018. Like its predecessor Amber Galactic, Sometimes The World Ain't Enough has been nominated to the Swedish Grammy Awards for best rock/metal release. == Band members == Current members * Bj\u00f6rn \"Speed\" Strid \u2013 vocals (2007\u2013present) * David Andersson \u2013 guitar (2007\u2013present) * Sharlee D'Angelo \u2013 bass guitar (2007\u2013present) * Jonas K\u00e4llsb\u00e4ck \u2013 drums (2007\u2013present) * Sebastian Forslund \u2013 congas, percussion, guitar (2014\u2013present) * Anna-Mia Bonde \u2013 backup vocals (2017\u2013present) * Anna Bryg\u00e5rd \u2013 backup vocals (2017\u2013present) Past members * Richard Larsson \u2013 keyboards (2007\u20132020) == Discography == Studio albums * Internal Affairs (2012) * Skyline Whispers (2015) * Amber Galactic (2017) * Sometimes the World Ain't Enough (2018) * Aeromantic (2020) == References == == External links == * The Night Flight Orchestra on Nuclear Blast * The Night Flight Orchestra's Myspace profile * Coroner Records - official website Category:Swedish hard rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2007 ",
