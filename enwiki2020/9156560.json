The Railway Department changed this to Dululu in 1915 to avoid confusion with Buneru, another town located near Wowan. The name derives from an Indigenous word meaning \"soft\". Dululu Post Office opened by 1920 (a receiving office had been open from 1915). At the 2011 census, Dululu and the surrounding area had a population of 139. ==References== == External links == * \"Our Town Dululu\" (PDF file) * Town map of Dululu, 1980 Category:Towns in Queensland Category:Central Queensland Category:Shire of Banana Category:Localities in Queensland ",
