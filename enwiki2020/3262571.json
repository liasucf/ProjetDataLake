    "text": "Alfred John Barnes (17 July 188726 November 1974) was a British Labour Co- operative politician. Born in North Woolwich, he was the youngest child of William Barnes, a docker. Barnes lost a leg in a fairground accident at the age of 8. He was educated at the Northampton Institute and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Barnes worked originally as an artist in gold and silver. He was an early member of the Independent Labour Party and was heavily involved in the co-operative movement. He was chairman of the London Co- operative Society for nine years until 1923 and was a founder of the Co- operative Party. He became the Party's chairman in 1924 and served until 1945. He was also a director and President of the National Cooperative Publishing Society. In November 1922, Barnes was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Ham South. In 1925, he was appointed a Labour Whip and served as a whip in Government, as Junior Lord of the Treasury. However, he was forced to resign in October 1930 - although his position as a director of the National Cooperative Publishing Society was unpaid, parliamentary rules dictated that a minister cannot be a director of a public company (although they could be of a private company): Barnes chose to remain on the co-op board rather than as a whip. Like many Labour MPs, he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but regained it in 1935. In 1945, Barnes was made a Privy Counsellor and Minister of War Transport, later Minister of Transport, serving until the fall of the Labour government in 1951. He stood down as a Member of Parliament at the 1955 general election. ==References== ==External links== * *The Times Guides to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Ltd, 1945, 1950, 1951 *(2003) The Times Guides to the House of Commons, 1929, 1931, 1935, Politico's Publishing (reprint). * Category:1887 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Labour Co- operative MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Attlee governments, 1945\u20131951 Category:Participants in the Norway Debate Category:People from North Woolwich Category:Secretaries of State for Transport (UK) Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923 Category:UK MPs 1923\u20131924 Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929 Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931 Category:UK MPs 1935\u20131945 Category:UK MPs 1945\u20131950 Category:UK MPs 1950\u20131951 Category:UK MPs 1951\u20131955 ",
