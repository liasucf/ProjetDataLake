    "text": "Encore is an album led by jazz trombonist Eddie Bert recorded in 1955 and first released on the Savoy label.Savoy Records Catalog: 12000 series accessed September 17, 2018Discography of the Savoy/Regent and Associated labels accessed September 17, 2018 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated: \"Trombonist Eddie Bert has had a long and honorable musical career but relatively few opportunities to record as a leader. He is heard in two different settings ... with a pianoless quartet that includes guitarist Joe Puma and with a quintet that includes pianist Hank Jones and the complementary tenor of J.R. Monterose. The repertoire consists entirely of originals by either Bert or Puma but the style is very much of the era: cool-toned and lightly swinging bop. ... the music is worth exploring\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Eddie Bert except where noted # \"Bert Tram\" \u2013 3:05 # \"One for Tubby\" (Joe Puma) \u2013 5:25 # \"It's Only Sunshine\" (Puma) \u2013 3:12 # \"Opicana\" (Puma) \u2013 3:23 # \"Conversation\" \u2013 6:45 # \"Crosstown\" \u2013 7:15 # \"Manhattan Suite\" \u2013 5:43 *Recorded at Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ on June 22 (tracks 1-4) & September 1 (tracks 5-7), 1955 ==Personnel== *Eddie Bert \u2013 trombone *Joe Puma \u2013 guitar (tracks 1-4) *J.
