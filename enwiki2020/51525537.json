Dhanamanjuri University is a long cherished dream of our founding fathers and Maharani Dhanamanjuri, the mother spirit in the birth of this seat of learning, translated into action. Manipur, an ancient Kingdom, had a composite traditional system of education in the field of warfare, martial arts, games and sports, culture and many other schools of thought training the people in various professional activities in ancient forms. The people have carried down this legacy of quest for knowledge and civilized existence since time immemorial. Ancient works of knowledge in the original scripts of Manipur stand as testimony to the nurturing of the idea of a University in the minds of our forefathers and foremothers. The state has celebrated the tradition of a purely intellectual pursuit which conserves the original ethos of the land and its people while receptive with an open mind to change in course of time. The University was established under the National Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) as fulfilment of one of its primary components i.e., to convert colleges to cluster Universities. Maharani Dhanamanjuri gifted us Dhanamanjuri College and in recognition of her contribution to the development of Higher Education, the university is named after Maharani Dhanamanjuri. The University is built up of the three Dhanamanjuri Colleges namely DM College of Science, DM College of Arts, DM College of Commerce along with G.P. Women's College and LMS Law College. DM University at present is functioning from DM College campus situated in the heart of Imphal city and the campus is bounded by National Highway No.2 in the East, Thangmeiband road in the West and North, and the Naga River in the South.
