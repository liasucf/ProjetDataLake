Among eight types of marriages defined in Hinduism, as specifically mentioned in Manu Smriti (Verse 3.21)), namely (1) Brahma (Hindi: \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e), (2) Daiva (Hindi: \u0926\u0948\u0935), (3) Arsha (Hindi: \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0936), (4) Prajapatya (Hindi: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u092a\u0924\u094d\u092f), (5) Asura (Hindi: \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0930), (6) Gandharva (Hindi: \u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0930\u094d\u0935), (7) Rakshasa (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938), and (8) Paishacha (Hindi: \u092a\u0948\u0936\u093e\u091a), this is recommended for Vaishyas and Shudra among four varnas of the Hindu social order in Hinduism. This form of marriage is not recommended for Brahmin and Kshatriya and as such considered as unlawful. Typically, it depends on will and desire of man and his wealth but irrespective of willingness of bride. This type of marriage literally amounts to purchasing the bride by a paying a price to her kinsmen. By taking undue advantage of this type a marriage, a rich but incompetent man can have as many wives but poor and competent man may not be able to afford the money to be paid. For such reasons, this type of marriage is not considered as dignified but viewed as lowly. ==References== Category:Marriage in Hinduism Category:Family Category:Vedic Customs ",
