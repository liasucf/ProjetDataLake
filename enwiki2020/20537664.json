In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2015-10-06 Phyllodesmium briareum (one specimen at the bottom of the image) looks very similar to the soft coral Briareum violaceum (at the top of the image). == Distribution == The distribution of Phyllodesmium briareum includes Indo-Pacific and Australia.Rudman, W.B., 1999 (November 25) Phyllodesmium briareum (Bergh, 1896). [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. == Description == Phyllodesmium briareum uses camouflage and looks like the soft coral Briareum violacea with which it is often found. It grows to 25 mm in length. This species contains zooxanthellae but has cerata of conventional aeolid shape.Rudman, W. B. 1981. The anatomy and biology of alcyonarian-feeding aeolid opisthobranch mollusks and their development of symbiosis with zooxanthellae. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 72:219\u2013262. == Ecology == Phyllodesmium briareum is reported to feed on a number of species of briareid soft coral including Solenopodium stelleri and Briareum stecheri (sensu MacFadyen, 1936). It is also reported from Pachyclavularia violacea.Rudman W.B. 1991.
