She was a daughter of the wealthy merchant Johann Ludvig Zinn and grew up in the Zinn House at Kv\u00e6sthusgade 3. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959. == Biography == Henry Thalbitzer, Sophie's husband Sophie Dorothea Zinn was born into a wealthy merchant family in Copenhagen, the daughter of Johann Ludvig Zinn and his wife. She read many books and was particularly struck by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions. One of her father's business partners, Hinrich Ladiges, a wealthy sugar manufacturer who was 40 years her senior, proposed to her when she was 17 years old. Her father was strongly in favour of the liaison but she declined. She later married Henry Thalbitzer (1767\u20131818) who was Royal Prussian consul to Helsing\u00f8r. She was widowed in 1818. == Grandma's Confessions == She wrote her memoirs after she became a widow at the age of 41. They were originally intended for their son Billy (Carl Wm. Thalbitzer) but later published under the name Grandmama's Bekiendelser. They offer a first-hand account of everyday life as a child and young woman in an upper- class environment in Copenhagen during the late 18th and early 19th century. == References == == External links == * Sophie Thalbitzer on Geni Category:1774 births Category:1851 deaths Category:Danish women memoirists Category:18th-century Danish memoirists Category:19th-century Danish memoirists Category:Danish women writers Category:Writers from Copenhagen Category:19th-century Danish writers ",
