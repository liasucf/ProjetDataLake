Known in classical antiquity as Sebennytos (), Samannud is a historic city that has been inhabited since the Ancient Egyptian period. As of 2019, the population of the markaz of Samannud was estimated to be 410,388, with 83,417 people living in urban areas and 326,971 in rural areas. ==Etymology== Historically, Samannud was called Sebennytos or Sebennytus (, also in late Coptic \u2ca5\u2c89\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c9b\u2c8f\u2ca7\u2c9f\u2ca9 and \u2ca5\u2c89\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c9b\u2c89\u2ca7\u2c9f\u2ca9, ,Ptolemy iv. 5. \u00a7 50, Stephanus of Byzantium or ,Strabo xvii. p. 802 Egyptian: \u1e6fb-(n)-n\u1e6fr). The name Samannud ultimately derives from the Ancient Egyptian name \u1e6fb-(n)-n\u1e6fr, meaning \"city of the sacred calf\". The name was probably pronounced * in Old Egyptian and * or * in Late Egyptian.Loprieno, Antonio (1995) Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, , p. 34 ==Ancient history== Samannud (Sebennytos) was an ancient city of Lower Egypt, located on the now-silted up Sebennytic branch of the Nile in the Delta. Sebennytos was the capital of Lower Egypt's twelfth nome\u2014the Sebennyte nome (district). Sebennytos was also the seat of the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt (380\u2013343 BCE). Sebennytos is perhaps best known as the hometown of Manetho, a historian and chronicler from the Ptolemaic era, c. 3rd century BC. Sebennytos was also the hometown of Nectanebo II; he was its last ruler.Bill Manley, The Seventy Great Mysteries of Ancient Egypt\" Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2003. p.101 A temple dedicated to the local god Anhur, or Anhur-Shu, and his lioness goddess mate Mehit, once existed at this location but is now reduced to ruins. A fragment from the location where kings would have made offerings to Anhur and his wife, is on display at the Walters Art Museum. ==Modern history== Samannud violently resisted the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 639, and remained rebellious for some time thereafter; the city revolted four times in the first half of the eighth century. Three Coptic Patriarchs came from Samannud: John III, Cosmas II, and John V. The 12th-century Coptic philologist Yuhanna al-Samannudi also came from Samannud, and served as its bishop. Samannud's bishopric remained active through the late thirteenth century, indicating the presence of a large Christian population at the time. In 1843, John Gardner Wilkinson described it as a place of some size, with the usual bazaars of the large towns of Egypt, and famous for its pottery, which was sent to Cairo. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Samannud as a city in its own district in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 11,550 (5,686 men and 5,864 women). ==In religious traditions== In a Coptic tradition, Sebennytos was part of the route of the Holy Family during the flight into Egypt narrated in the Gospel of Matthew (2:13\u201323). ==Gallery== File:Egyptian - Corner Relief Fragment with King Ptolemy II Philadelphos, Mehyet, and Onuris-Shu - Walters 225 - Detail B.jpg|thumb|Detail of Mehit at Walters Art Museum File:SamannudNileBank.jpg File:SamannudMuseum.jpg File:SamannudSalama.jpg File:SamannudMitwalli.jpg ==See also== *List of cities and towns in Egypt ==References== Category:Populated places established in the 4th century BC Category:Archaeological sites in Egypt Category:Roman sites in Egypt Category:Former populated places in Egypt Category:Nile Delta Category:Cities in ancient Egypt Category:Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Geography of Egypt Category:Former capitals of Egypt ",
