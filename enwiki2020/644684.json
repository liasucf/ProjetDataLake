    "text": "Darryl John Sutter (born August 19, 1958) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player and advisor to the head coach of Anaheim Ducks. He was most recently head coach of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL), with whom he won two Stanley Cup titles. He is one of seven Sutter brothers, six of whom made the NHL (Brent, Brian, Darryl, Duane, Rich and Ron); all but Rich and Gary (the seventh Sutter brother) worked alongside Darryl in some capacity during Darryl Sutter's tenure with the Calgary Flames. Sutter has also coached for the San Jose Sharks and the Chicago Blackhawks, the latter of which he spent his entire NHL playing career with, from 1979 to 1987. ==Playing career== As a player, Sutter spent five years in the minor leagues, including a year in Japan, where he was named rookie of the year. He stands 5 foot 11 inches and his playing weight was 176 pounds. Sutter was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks at the 1978 NHL Entry Draft in the 11th round, 179th overall. In his NHL career, he suited up only for the Blackhawks and scored 279 points (161 goals and 118 assists) in 406 career regular season games, in addition to 43 points (24 goals and 19 assists) in 51 Stanley Cup playoff games. His last season as a player was in 1986\u201387. ==Coaching career== ===Chicago Blackhawks and San Jose Sharks=== Sutter began his coaching career in the International Hockey League (IHL), where he coached the Saginaw Hawks and led the Indianapolis Ice to the Turner Cup as League champions. He was the head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks for three seasons and also served as Chicago's assistant coach in 1987\u201388 and as associate coach from 1990 to 1992. He led Chicago to a first-place finish in the Norris Division\u2014and the best record in the Campbell Conference\u2014in 1992\u201393 with a 47\u201325\u201312 record (106 points), only to be swept in the opening round by the St. Louis Blues, which featured his brother Rich on the team. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, he led Chicago to the Western Conference Finals. Following the 1994\u201395 season, he stepped down as coach of the Blackhawks to return home to the family farm in Viking, Alberta. The decision was largely made out of necessity for him to be with his son, Christopher, who has Down syndrome. After a two- year hiatus from coaching, Sutter returned to the NHL in 1997\u201398 season as head coach of the San Jose Sharks, coaching the team until being relieved of his duties on December 1, 2002, just 24 games into the 2002\u201303 season. ===Calgary Flames=== On December 28, 2002, four weeks after he was fired by San Jose, Sutter was named head coach of the Calgary Flames, replacing Greg Gilbert, who had been fired by Calgary on December 3. In April 2003, with Calgary already out of contention of a 2003 playoff spot and then-General Manager Craig Button's contract expiring, the Flames added the title of GM to Sutter's job responsibilities. In the 2003\u201304 season, his first full season in Calgary, Sutter led the Flames to a 42\u201330\u20137\u20133 record and the organization's first trip to the playoffs in seven seasons. En route to the Stanley Cup Finals, where Calgary ultimately lost in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flames defeated three higher-ranked opponents in the Western Conference playoff bracket\u2014the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks. Sutter and the Flames were unable to build upon their surprise success, however, as the entire following season, 2004\u201305, was cancelled due to a lockout. Sutter at the 2006 NHL Awards. On July 12, 2006, Sutter stepped down as head coach of the Flames. He has said that he found it difficult to handle the jobs of both head coach and GM of the Flames. Sutter compiled a 107\u201373\u201326 record in two-plus seasons behind the Calgary bench. The Flames promoted Jim Playfair as Sutter's replacement, but after a first-round loss to Detroit in 2006\u201307, Sutter hired Mike Keenan as head coach, with Playfair stepping back into an associate coaching role. Keenan was then fired a month after the Flames were eliminated from the 2008\u201309 playoffs by Chicago. Brent Sutter, former coach of the New Jersey Devils, was selected as the new Flames coach in June 2009. On December 28, 2010, Sutter resigned as the general manager of the Flames. ===Los Angeles Kings=== On December 17, 2011, the Los Angeles Kings hired Sutter mid-season as the team's new head coach after the dismissal of Terry Murray. Sutter's first game with the Kings was a December 22, 2011, shootout victory over the rival Anaheim Ducks. He led the Kings to a 25\u201313\u201311 mark in 49 games, finished third in the Pacific Division, and entered the 2012 playoffs as the eighth and last seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the team beat the first seed Vancouver Canucks, second seed St. Louis Blues and third seed Phoenix Coyotes to advance to the Stanley Cup Final, the only team to accomplish that feat in the 119-year history of the Finals. The Kings then went on to defeat New Jersey four games to two to give Los Angeles its first Stanley Cup championship in its 45-year history. The Kings set several records during the playoffs, including winning ten-straight games on the road and being the first team to go three games to zero in each of their playoff series.NHL.com - Kings make history, poised to make more - Bracket Challenge - 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs Sutter and the Kings later won another Stanley Cup in the 2013\u201314 season, playing 26 playoff games, the most ever for a Cup champion. The Kings also became only the fourth team in NHL history to come back from down three games to zero in a series after shocking the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Quarterfinals. Los Angeles then went on to defeat Anaheim and Chicago, both in seven-game series. On June 13, 2014, the Kings beat the New York Rangers in five games to win their second Stanley Cup in three years. Despite posting a 40\u201327\u201315 record in the 2014\u201315 season, Sutter and the Kings missed the 2015 playoffs by four points, becoming the first team since the 2006\u201307 Carolina Hurricanes to miss the playoffs entirely after winning the Stanley Cup the previous year, and only the fourth in NHL history. On April 10, 2017, Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), owner of the Los Angeles Kings, relieved Sutter of his coaching duties after the Kings missed the playoffs for the second season in three years.LA Kings Fire Head Coach and GM.
