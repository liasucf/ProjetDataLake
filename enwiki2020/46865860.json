Museeuw distanced Baldato on the steep upper slopes of the Muur and powered on to the finish, taking his second win. Andrei Tchmil caught Baldato in the final kilometers, but was beaten by the Italian in the sprint for second place. ==Climbs== There were fifteen categorized climbs: {| width=65% | valign=top align=left width=33% | * Tiegemberg * Kluisberg * Knokteberg * Oude Kwaremont * Paterberg | valign=top align=left width=34% | * Kortekeer * Taaienberg * Eikenberg * Volkegemberg * Varent | valign=top align=left width=33% | * Leberg * Molenberg * Berendries * Muur-Kapelmuur * Bosberg |} ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- |1 | | Mapei-GB | align=right| 6h 36' 24\" |- |2 | | MG-Technogym | align=right| + 1' 27\" |- |3 | | Lotto | align=right| s.t. |- |4 | | Carrera | align=right| + 2' 03\" |- |5 | | Mapei-GB | align=right| s.t. |- |6 | | TVM | align=right| s.t. |- |7 | | Mercatone Uno | align=right| + 2' 05\" |- |8 | | Novell Team | align=right| + 3' 25\" |- |9 | | MG-Technogym | align=right| s.t. |- |10 | | Mapei-GB | align=right| s.t. |} ==External links== * Recap of the race (Flemish television) ==References== Category:Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour Of Flanders ",
