    "text": "Charles Ryskamp (October 21, 1928 \u2013 March 26, 2010) was a former director of both The Frick Collection and the Pierpont Morgan Library, a longtime professor at Princeton University, and an avid collector of drawings and prints. He was born in East Grand Rapids, Michigan, or Grand Rapids, Michigan. At the time of his death the Yale Center for British Art had selections from his collection featured in the exhibition \"Varieties of Romantic Experience: Drawings from the Collection of Charles Ryskamp\". This exhibition, which was to be up from February 4 until April 25, 2010, included works from Ryskamp's collection by Romantic period artists such as J. M. W. Turner, William Blake, David Wilkie and Caspar David Friedrich. His collection of Danish Golden Age drawings with works by among others Christen K\u00f8bke and Johan Thomas Lundbye was one of the finest in private hands. Charles Ryskamp died on March 26, 2010 at the age of 81. The Ryskamp collection was sold at auction by Sotheby's in New York City primarily to benefit Princeton University on January 25, 2011, during the house's Old Masters week. ==References== * * ==External links== * Exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art * Sotheby's ecatalogue of the Ryskamp Collection Category:American curators Category:American art collectors Category:1928 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Calvin University alumni Category:People from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:People from East Grand Rapids, Michigan ",
