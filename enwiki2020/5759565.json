Stella Hall belonged to the Lords Widdrington in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1792, it was inherited by John Towneley, whose mother was Mary, daughter of the 3rd Baron Widdrington. Its descent then followed that of the main Towneley Park estate near Burnley, Lancashire, to John's son Peregrine Towneley and was recorded as a property of 281 acres belonging to him in 1848.British History Accessed 2010 The Hall was later the home of Joseph Cowen, and is believed to have been purchased by his father, the newspaper and coal millionaire Sir Joseph Cowen, around 1850. However, in 1878, on the death of Peregrine's son, also called John Towneley, 2,826 acres, probably formerly part of this estate, was distributed between his daughters.Tracing the Towneleys at towneley.org.uk, accessed 2010 The Hall remained in the Cowen family until Jane Cowen's death in 1946.
