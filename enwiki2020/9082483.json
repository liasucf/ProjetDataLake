    "text": "520x520px Complex interdependence in international relations is the idea put forth by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye that states and their fortunes are inextricably tied together. These complex relationships can be explored through both the liberal and realism lenses and can later explain the debate of power from complex interdependence. ==History of the term== The term \"complex interdependence\" was claimed by Raymond Leslie Buell in 1925 to describe the new ordering among economies, cultures, and races. The very concept was popularized through the work of Richard N. Cooper (1968).With the analytical construct of complex interdependence in their critique of political realism, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explore how international politics forever changed due to the emerging complex interactions and interdependence among states. The theorists recognized that the various and complex transnational connections and interdependencies between states and societies increased, while military force and power balancing are decreasing but remain essential. In coining the interdependence concept, Keohane and Nye also notably differentiated between interdependence and dependence in analyzing the role of power in politics and the relations between international actors. From the analysis, complex interdependence is characterized by three characteristics, involving # The use of multiple channels of action between societies in interstate, transgovernmental, and transnational relations, # The absence of a hierarchy of issues with changing agendas and linkages between issues prioritized, and # The objective of bringing about a decline in military force and coercive power in international relations. Thus, Nye and Keohane argue that the decline of military force as a policy tool and the increase in economic and other forms of interdependence should increase the probability of cooperation among states. The theorists' work surfaced in the 1970s to become a significant challenge to political realist theory in international politics. It became foundational to current theorists that it be categorized as liberalism (international relations), neoliberalism, and liberal institutionalism. Traditional critiques of liberalism often define alongside critiques of political realism. They both ignore the social nature of relations between states and the social fabric of international society. With the rise of neoliberal economics, debates, and the need to clarify international relations theory, Keohane has most recently described himself as merely an institutionalist. This theory's purpose is to develop sociological perspectives in contemporary International relations theory Liberal, neoliberal, and liberal institutional theories continue to influence international politics and have become closely intertwined with political realism. == Multiple channels== Multiple channels that are present in complex interdependence are \"connect societies, including informal ties between governmental elites as well as formal foreign office arrangements.\" The second type is \"informal ties among nongovernmental elites where contact usually happens either face-to-face or through telecommunication. The last type is \"Transnational organization,\" including organizations such as multinational banks or corporations. A more straightforward way of thinking of these concepts is by condensing them by calling them interstate, transgovernmental and transnational relations. Therefore, these channels can be a way of communication for states and are a considerable part of complex interdependence. :a. Interstate relations are thought to be \"normal channels\" by realists. It is also known as \"horizontal dimensions of federalism.\" :b. Transgovernmental relations \"applies when we relax the realist assumption that states act coherently as units.\" Crane Liberals believe that states can work together in order to enhance interdependence. :c. Transnational relations \"applies when we relax the assumption that states are the only units.\" This take is more of the liberal perspective evident throughout international relations because of institutions' beliefs. === Political Economy of Complex Interdependence === The complex relationships promoted in complex interdependence can be observed in the International Political Economy. As Globalism matures, the political economies of the world grow interdependent. This perspective assumes that the global system is complex, that states' behavior in this system is rational, that global relationships continue to grow in relevance, and that the system of international political economy is not closed. All of this complexity surmises in the uncertain environment of international politics. States that partake in this system hold economic connections with other economies, promoting interdependence between participating states. ==== Economic Coercion ==== The emergence of complex interdependence has created dependency among states, as the liberal theorists described. Yet, the realist take on power can be displayed through the economic imbalance experienced among states to inflict their influence through complex interdependence. Such an example would include how China could use loans to fund a new port in Sri Lanka, knowing that Sri Lanka could not pay due to increasing debt. Later, China collected it for themselves. Through the complex relationships and needs of other states, states may use their own systematical advantage over the states that rely on them more. Such complex interdependence can be seen as a negative and a positive among states. Often, states may use such relationships for the greater good of themselves or, at times, the greater good of the other. Economic Coercion through complex interdependence can allow the states to ensure a better world order for all states involved and humanity. Jeff D. Colgan discusses the example of Climate change reform emerging from economic ties. He considers how China's economic dependency on the United States creates fertile ground to instill climate change policies using a \"climate change club\" of the United States and the European Union. Any member not in this club would be subject to tariffs from member states, including China, if they don't join. The United States must then decide whether removing economic ties is valuable for them or if maintaining economic relations with China is of more excellent value for all based on the complex interdependence. Such a move displays the ideas of realists in the complex interactions among states. ==References== ==Further reading== *Keohane, R.O., & Nye, J.S. (1987). Power and Interdependence Revisited.
