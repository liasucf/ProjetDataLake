    "text": "A nurse anesthetist is an advanced practice nurse who administers anesthesia for surgery or other medical procedures. Nurse anesthetists are involved in the administration of anesthesia in a majority of countries, with varying levels of autonomy. A 2002 survey reported that there were 107 countries where nurse anesthetists provide anesthesia and nine countries where nurses assist others in the administration of anesthesia.McAuliffe, M.S., Henry B.

Retrieved May 23, 2007, from http://ifna-int.org/ifna/page.php?16 == In the United States == In the United States, the term \"Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist\" (CRNA) is used to denote advanced practice registered nurses with a doctorate or master's, specializing in the administration of anesthesia. Nurse Anesthetists are required to have 7 to 8 years of education, training, and experience before they can become a CRNA; the average critical care experience prior to entering a master\u2019s or doctorate nurse anesthesia program is 3.5 years. CRNA's account for approximately half of the anesthesia providers in the United States and are the main providers of anesthesia in rural America, U.S. military, Veteran\u2019s Administration, medically underserved communities, and to maternity patients. 49,000+ nurse anesthetists administer approximately 43 million anesthetics to patients each year. CRNA\u2019s are trained to administer every type of anesthesia. Historically, nurse anesthetists have been providing anesthesia care to patients since the American Civil War more than 150 years ago. The CRNA credential came into existence in 1956 and approximately 40% of nurse anesthetists are male. Scope of practice limitations and practitioner oversight requirements vary between healthcare facility and state, with 17 states and Guam granting complete autonomy as of 2016. In states that have opted out of supervision, the Joint Commission and CMS recognize CRNA's as licensed independent practitioners. In states requiring supervision, CRNA's have liability separate from any supervising practitioner and are able to administer anesthesia independently of physician anesthesiologists. Some CRNAs use the title nurse anesthesiologist as a synonym for nurse anesthetist; groups representing anesthesiologists and other medical doctors, such as the American Medical Association and American Society of Anesthesiologists, oppose the use of this phrase to describe CRNAs and call it misleading.Andy Nghiem, AMA: Anesthesiologists that aren't licensed shouldn't refer to themselves as such, Patient Daily (July 31, 2020).Christine Sexton,Nursing Board Signs Off On 'Anesthesiologist' Title, News Service of Florida (August 20, 2020). == Internationally == Currently there are 107 countries where nurse anesthetists practice and nine countries where nurses assist in the administration of anesthesia. In 1989, the International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists was established. They have developed standards of education, practice, and a code of ethics. Delegates from 35 member countries participate in the World Congress every few years. == See also == * Anesthesiologist assistant == References == Category:Anesthesia Category:Advanced practice registered nursing Category:Hospital nursing ",
