A sum of \u00a328,000 had already been spent by the heritage railway on upgrading the track from . Work started on the station's construction in October 2014, with the official opening taking place on 22 November 2014. The date also coincided with the restart of services from . The first train to arrive at the brand new station was a four-coach service hauled by HN Rail's Brush Type 4 Class 47 715 Poseidon in Fragonset livery. The station, along with that at , was closed in August 2016 following a collision between a train and a car at a level crossing near Yafforth. It is hoped to re-open the line and station at a future date once work to upgrade the level crossing equipment is complete. ==Future== The aim of the Wensleydale Railway in the long-term is to extend the line to station and allow passengers to interchange with National Rail services. As this will require an agreement with Network Rail, the provision of the platform is an interim solution which will allow the track to be brought into more regular use whilst also bringing in extra income for the heritage railway. ==See also== *Railways in Northallerton ==References== ==External links== *Video and commentary on Northallerton West railway station Category:Heritage railway stations in North Yorkshire Category:Railway stations built for UK heritage railways Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 2014 Category:Northallerton Category:2014 establishments in England ",
