In 2006, she defended the admission of Luis Patti to the Chamber: She was one of the legislators who chose not to attend a March 2006 session in which the Chamber repudiated the 1976 coup d'\u00e9tat because she considered it to be \"a biased view of history.\" Ginzburg was denounced as a homophobe for her claims during a 2008 parliamentary debate that homosexuals \"have a disability for having children\" and are \"a capricious minority\", but the National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) did not consider this complaint valid.
