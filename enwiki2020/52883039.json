Through his mother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Cazalet, he also descended from a family of Huguenots from the C\u00e9vennes. Mac-Avoy studied in Switzerland where he received his baccalaur\u00e9at. His artistic talent caused a brief hesitation between theatre and painting, but having chosen the latter, he entered the Acad\u00e9mie Julian at the age of 18 and studied there with Paul Albert Laurens. In Paris, he frequented the house of Felix Vallotton and met Bonnard and Vuillard who showed an interest in his work. === Career === Mac-Avoy sold his first painting to the government when he was only 19 years old. It was exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. He then branched out into landscapes, urban scenes and portraits, before devoting himself almost exclusively to the latter genre. At the Salon des Tuileries, in 1936, he exhibited only portraits in a style so distinctive and discordant to current fashions that he was compared to a Philippe de Champaigne. In 1939, he married Anne Coquebert de Neuville, with whom he had three children. Dominique, Patrick and Pascale. When the Second World War broke out, he was mobilized and joined the 5th Division of Motorized Infantry. Mac-Avoy received the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 and his experience of war is said to have influenced his style. Mac- Avoy made portraits of many writers, artists and politicians including Andr\u00e9 Gide, Pierre Larousse,On the site of the painter, property of \u00c9ditions Larousse, 21 rue du Montparnasse. Honegger, Mauriac, Picasso, de Gaulle, B\u00e9jart, and Johnny Hallyday.
