Because of his elegant football and his thin voice, he was known as \"The Violin\". In Flamengo, he won the 1961 Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo and twice the Rio State Championship (1963 and 1965). Carlinhos was capped for the Brazilian national team several times in the 1960s. He was one of the few players to receive the Belfort Duarte Trophy (\"fair play award\") from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The award is given to the players who have never received a red card. His career as a manager started in 1983, when he coached Flamengo for five matches. Four years later, he was back at Flamengo when former coach Ant\u00f4nio Lopes was fired for the bad results in the 1987 Rio State Championship finals. At that time, Flamengo's squad had Brazilian star Renato Ga\u00facho, veteran players (such as Zico, Leandro, Andrade, Nunes and Edinho), and young ones, that had just came from the youth squad. Zico, the main star of the club, still recovering from several knee surgeries, wasn't at his top form. Carlinhos, with a little luck and much knowledge of the ways of the football, mixed veterans and newcomers to create a very competitive team, that won the 1987 Copa Uni\u00e3o. Five World Champions in the 1994 World Cup played for that team: Bebeto, Zinho, Aldair, Jorginho and Leonardo. Carlinhos returned in 1991, in similar conditions. His squad had J\u00fanior, near retirement, Zinho and many newbies (among them Djalminha and Marcelinho). After winning 1991 Rio State Championship, he won the fifth Brazilian National Championship for Flamengo in the 1992 finals against Botafogo (3-0, 2-2). He won another important title for Flamengo in 1999, the Mercosur Cup. As professional he disputed 880 matches: 517 as player and 313 as coach. On 12 February 2011, he was honored for Flamengo, with the unveiling of a bust and a square at the headquarters of the Club. Carlinhos died on 22 June 2015. == Honours == === Player === ==== Flamengo ==== * Torneio Rio\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo: 1961 * Campeonato Carioca: 1963, 1965 === Manager === ==== Flamengo ==== * Copa Mercosur: 1999 * Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 1992 * Copa Uni\u00e3o: 1987 * Campeonato Carioca: 1991, 1999, 2000 ==References== ==External links== * *JB Online Category:1937 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo managers Category:Guarani FC managers Category:Brazilian football managers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A managers Category:Association football midfielders ",
