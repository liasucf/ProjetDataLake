    "text": "Walter Spratt (14 April 1889 \u2013 22 January 1945) was an English professional footballer who played as a full-back in The Football League for Manchester United and Brentford. Born in Birmingham, he began his career with Rotherham Town and made guest appearances for Clapton Orient during the First World War. After leaving Brentford in 1921, he played for Sittingbourne for a year before ending his career with Elsecar Main. == Career == ===Early career=== Spratt while with Brentford in 1911. Born in Birmingham, Spratt began his career at Midland League club Rotherham Town in 1910, joining from local club Meadow Hall. A year later, he signed for Southern League First Division club Brentford and made more than 100 appearances for the club before departing Griffin Park in early 1915. ===Manchester United=== In February 1915, Spratt joined Football League First Division club Manchester United. He initially joined on a one-month trial after being released by Brentford (along with all their other professional players). Despite this, Brentford demanded Manchester United pay a fee to sign Spratt; United initially refused, but an Inter-League Board inquiry later ruled that they pay a fee of \u00a3175. He made his Football League debut on 6 February, playing at right-back in a 1\u20130 defeat to Sunderland. He made a total of 12 appearances during the 1914\u201315 season. Due to the ongoing First World War, Spratt did not make another competitive appearance for the Red Devils again until the 1919\u201320 season. During the war, he played for Manchester United in the wartime leagues, as well as making guest appearances for Clapton Orient. He was injured while playing for Clapton Orient and was not discharged from hospital until September 1919. He made his comeback from injury in a Manchester United reserve team game in January 1920, before making final appearance for the club a month later in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Arsenal on 28 February. === Return to Brentford === Spratt returned to Brentford in June 1920 for the club's first season in the Third Division South. He made just four appearances, with his final game coming in a 2\u20130 defeat to West London rivals Queens Park Rangers on Christmas Day 1920. Spratt departed Brentford at the end of the 1920\u201321 season, having made 123 appearances and scored one goal during his two spells with Brentford. === Sittingbourne === At the end of the 1920\u201321 season, Spratt moved to non-league club Sittingbourne and moved back to Yorkshire in 1922 to end his career with Elsecar Main. == Personal life == In 1906, Spratt served in the Royal Navy aboard HMS Boscawen III. After the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve in February 1915 and served on communications bases at Crystal Palace and on the Isle of Grain. While working as a despatcher for Mosers, Spratt was one of 35 people killed in a V-2 rocket attack on Southwark, London, on 22 January 1945. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Brentford |1911\u201312 | rowspan=\"2\" |Southern League First Division |31 |0 |5 |0 |36 |0 |- |1912\u201313 |30 |1 |2 |0 |32 |1 |- |1913\u201314 | rowspan=\"2\" |Southern League Second Division |30 |0 |3 |0 |33 |0 |- |1914\u201315 |15 |0 |3 |0 |18 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !106 !1 !13 !0 !119 !1 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Manchester United |1914\u201315 | rowspan=\"2\" |First Division |12 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |12 |0 |- |1919\u201320 |1 |0 |0 |0 |1 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !13 !0 !0 !0 !13 !0 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Brentford |1920\u201321 |Third Division |4 |0 |0 |0 |4 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Brentford total !110 !1 !13 !0 !123 !1 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !123 !1 !13 !0 !136 !1 |} ==References== Category:1889 births Category:English footballers Category:Sportspeople from Huddersfield Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football fullbacks Category:1945 deaths Category:Southern Football League players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Clapton Orient F.C. wartime guest players Category:Sittingbourne F.C. players Category:Royal Navy personnel of World War I Category:British civilians killed in World War II Category:Rotherham Town F.C.
