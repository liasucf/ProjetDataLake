He earned his Juris Doctor at the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1990. He began his career as a prosecutor in 1990, when he joined the Waukesha County District Attorney's office. In 2006 Schimel was elected Waukesha County District Attorney. He would be re-elected without opposition in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

B. Van Hollen won't seek third term as attorney general\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel October 7, 2013. Van Hollen endorsed Schimel as his replacement. In the 2014 general election, Schimel defeated opponent Susan Happ. As Wisconsin Attorney General, Schimel appealed the ruling by a federal judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin that Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects of Making a Murderer, had been coerced into confessing to a murder as an intellectually disabled 16-year old. Courts subsequently ruled either to free Dassey or block his release pending a new trial. Schimel argued that the United States Supreme Court should not hear Dassey's case; when the U.S. Supreme Court declined hearing Dassey's case, Schimel said he was pleased. Schimel also defended alleged gerrymandering by the state's Republican legislature, which resulted in the GOP controlling 64% of the legislative seats although the state is almost equally divided in the popular vote. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the state's most recent redistricting plan. Schimel petitioned the United States Supreme Court in 2017 to overturn that decision and said, \"...our redistricting process was entirely lawful and constitutional, and the district court should be reversed.\" However, Trevor Potter, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission and president of the Campaign Legal Center, objected, and wrote: \"The threat of partisan gerrymandering isn't a Democratic or Republican issue; it's an issue for all American voters.\" ==Electoral history== ===Waukesha District Attorney (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012)=== | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\"| Primary Election, September 12, 2006 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 7, 2006 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 4, 2008 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 2, 2010 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 6, 2012 ===Wisconsin Attorney General (2014, 2018)=== | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| Primary Election, August 12, 2014 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background- color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 4, 2014 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| Primary Election, August 14, 2018 | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\"| General Election, November 6, 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Wisconsin Attorney General's Office * Schimel's campaign website Category:1965 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:District attorneys in Wisconsin Category:Living people Category:People from Waukesha County, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee alumni Category:University of Wisconsin Law School alumni Category:Wisconsin Attorneys General Category:Wisconsin Republicans ",
