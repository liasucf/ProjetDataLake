The Todd Shipyards Corporation had previously fielded the professional Robins Dry Dock F.C. and the amateur Tebo Yacht Basin F.C.. The company combined the clubs to form Todd Shipyards F.C. and entered that club in the American Soccer League. Todd Shipyards F.C. finished 3rd in the league. The company decided not to operate a team the following season and their spot was filled by the Brooklyn Wanderers a month into the 1922-23 season. ==American Soccer League== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Date !Opponents !H/A !Result F\u2013A !Scorers !Attendance |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" |18 September 1921 |Celtic F.C. |H |7-0 |McKenna (3), McGuire (2), Campbell, Hosie | |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |25 September 1921 |Harrison S.C. |H |3-2 |Fryer, McKelvey, McKenna | |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |1 October 1921 |J. & P.
