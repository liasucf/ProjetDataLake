    "text": "Telemedia was a Canadian media company, which had holdings in radio, television and magazine publishing. The company was launched in 1968 by Philippe de Gasp\u00e9 Beaubien, when he purchased CKAC in Montreal from Power Corporation of Canada. CKAC remained the company's radio flagship for its entire existence. Telemedia was held privately until it became publicly traded in the late 1980s. Telemedia's magazine assets, including Canadian Living, Harrowsmith, Homemakers and the Canadian editions of TV Guide and Elle, were sold to Transcontinental Media in 2000. Standard Broadcasting subsequently acquired Telemedia's broadcasting assets in 2002, and sold some of them in turn to Rogers Communications and Newcap Broadcasting. ==Stations acquired by Standard== Through later transactions, almost all of these stations are now owned by Bell Media. ===Ontario=== * Hamilton - CHAM, CKLH, CKOC * London - CKSL, CJBK, CJBX, CIQM * Pembroke - CHVR * St. Catharines - CHRE, CHTZ, CKTB * Toronto - CHBM, CKFM, CFRB ===British Columbia=== * Dawson Creek - CJDC, CJDC- TV * Fort Nelson - CKRX * Fort St. John - CKNL, CHRX * Golden - CKGR * Kelowna - CKBL, CHSU * Kitimat - CKTK * Nelson - CKKC * Osoyoos - CJOR * Penticton - CJMG, CKOR * Prince Rupert - CHTK * Princeton - CIOR * Revelstoke - CKCR * Salmon Arm - CKXR * Summerland - CHOR * Terrace - CFTK, CFTK-TV, CJFW * Trail - CJAT * Vernon - CICF ===Alberta=== * Edmonton - CFMG ==Stations acquired by Rogers== All of the stations that were acquired by Rogers are located in Ontario.

Corus Entertainment acquired Radiom\u00e9dia by 2005 in exchange for Corus's smaller FM stations in Quebec. Astral re-entered the AM business in Quebec by 2007, when Standard Broadcasting exited the terrestrial broadcasting business as Astral acquired the stations.
