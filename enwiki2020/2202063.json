    "text": "The Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) provides firefighting and emergency medical services for the unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County, California, as well as 59 cities through contracting, including the city of La Habra which is located in Orange County and is the first city outside of Los Angeles County to contract with LACoFD. the department is responsible for just over 4 million residents spread out in over 1.2 million housing units across an area of . The department is commanded by Chief Daryl L. Osby and has an annual budget of $1.15 Billion. According to Firehouse magazine, the LACoFD is the 4th busiest department in the US, behind New York City Fire Department, Chicago Fire Department, and Los Angeles City Fire Department. The Department responded to 394,585 calls for service in 2017. The LACoFD has been featured several times in popular culture, including the 1970s NBC TV series Emergency! and the 1950s TV series Rescue 8. ==History== The Los Angeles County Fire Department began in 1920, and was known as the Los Angeles County Forestry Department and Los Angeles County Fire Protection Districts. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors enlisted Stuart J. Flintham to lead the new department, and directed him to establish a program for fire prevention and firefighting in the county. He succeeded in opening 30 Fire Protection Districts, which served, and continue to serve, towns and the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. Cities could choose to join the Fire Protection District by allocating property tax for this service. Cities formed as contract cities in the post-World War II period normally retained membership in the Fire Protection District. Following the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, property taxes were capped at 1% and the Fire Department charged cities fees for services when annexation occurred. Properties within the district that are not covered under a fee for service arrangement also pay a special fire tax as a result of Proposition E, passed in 1997.http://file.lacounty.gov/bos/supdocs/106403.pdf County vehicles assigned to the Los Angeles County Fire Department continue to list as registered owner the \"Consolidated Fire Protection District of Los Angeles County\" on California Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. ==Emergency operations== The Los Angeles County Fire Department Emergency Operations are commanded by Chief Deputy David R. Richardson. The 4 Bureaus that the Chief Deputy oversees contain the bulk of the uniformed firefighting personnel and apparatus that the Fire Department provides, as well as the Technical Services Division. The 3 Operations Bureaus consist of the neighborhood fire stations and camps that are geographically based, while the fourth bureau has specialized teams that respond throughout the county. The 3 Operations Bureaus of LACoFD serve 59 cities and all unincorporated communities with 22 Battalions and 9 Divisions. Each Division is commanded by an assistant chief and each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief. There are 2 Engine Companies at some fire stations. There are Medic Engines and PAU Engines. Fire Station 127 is the famous Emergency! Fire Station and it was designated Station 51 and it is named The Robert A. Cinader Station in honor of the man who made Emergency! famous. ===Fire suppression camps=== The LACoFD has 10 fire camps with handcrews which are used for both fire prevention and wildland firefighting. In 2013, to help combat jail crowding as well as increase time served by serious criminal offenders, Los Angeles County sent more than 500 inmates to firefighting camps in mountain and foothill areas. Inmates assigned to the camps are nonviolent offenders who have completed physical and security screenings. They are trained by county firefighters to help fight fires and assist with clearing brush and debris. The camps are run in conjunction with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Los Angeles County Probation Department. ===Rank Structure=== \u2022Firefighter Trainee \u2022Firefighter \u2022Firefighter Specialist/Engineer \u2022Fire Captain \u2022Battalion Chief (Battalion Commander) \u2022Assistant Chief (Division Commander) \u2022Deputy Chief (Bureau Commander) \u2022Chief Deputy \u2022Fire Chief == Apparatus == The Los Angeles County Fire Department utilizes a wide array of firefighting apparatus, including Engines, Quints, Trucks, Light Forces (Engine + Quint or Truck), Patrols, and Water Tenders. Support apparatus include Rescue Squads, Hazardous Materials Squads, and Urban Search & Rescue Squads. LACoFD apparatus are painted reddish-orange as opposed to LAFD apparatus, which are fire engine red. ===Tiller trucks=== While many modern fire departments have opted to go with trucks/quints that have rear-mounted ladders, the LACoFD has chosen to stay with tiller trucks because of their enhanced maneuverability in tight areas. The benefit of a quint is that it also has a built in pump and water tank and can thus operate without an engine. The Tiller trucks carry fire suppression tools and medical equipment as well as specialized rescue equipment for responses to a variety of emergencies. ===Helicopters=== S-70A Firehawk performs a water drop demonstration. The LA County Fire Department has 10 helicopters available for aerial firefighting. With the exception of Copter 10 which is used primarily for command purposes, all copters are outfitted with water drop tanks for aerial firefighting. The headquarters for the Air Operations Section is located at Barton Heliport, next to Whiteman Airport in Pacoima. * Five Sikorsky S-70A/S-70i Firehawks Copter 15, Copter 16, Copter 19, Copter 21, and Copter 22 are fitted with tanks. * One Bell 412 Copter 12 is fitted with a tank. * Two Bell 412EP Copter 11 and Copter 14 are outfitted with tanks. * Two Bell 412HP Copter 17 and Copter 18 are outfitted with tanks. == Stations and apparatus == . Engines with an 4+station number are Type 3 wildland engines. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! Fire Station or Camp Number ! City/unincorporated area ! Engine Company !
