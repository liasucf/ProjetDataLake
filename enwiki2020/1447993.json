The 1980 Olympics marked the second time that the United States men's team did not win the gold medal in Olympic basketball; Yugoslavia won gold in the men's tournament and the Soviet Union in the women's competition. ==Medal summary== {| |-valign=\"top\" !Men's | valign=top | Andro Knego Dragan Ki\u0107anovi\u0107 Rajko \u017di\u017ei\u0107 Mihovil Naki\u0107 \u017deljko Jerkov Branko Skro\u010de Zoran Slavni\u0107 Kresimir \u0106osi\u0107 Ratko Radovanovi\u0107 Duje Krstulovi\u0107 Dra\u017een Dalipagi\u0107 Mirza Deliba\u0161i\u0107 | valign=top | Fabrizio Della Fiori Marco Solfrini Marco Bonamico Dino Meneghin Renato Villalta Renzo Vecchiato Pierluigi Marzorati Pietro Generali Romeo Sacchetti Roberto Brunamonti Michael Sylvester Enrico Gilardi | valign=top | Stanislav Yeryomin Valeri Miloserdov Sergei Tarakanov Aleksandr Salnikov Andrei Lopatov Nikolai Deriugin Sergei Belov Vladimir Tkachenko Anatoli Myshkin Serg\u0117jus Jovai\u0161a Aleksandr Belostenny Vladimir Zhigily |-valign=\"top\" !Women's | valign=top | Olga Barysheva Tatyana Ivinskaya Nelli Feryabnikova Vida Beselien\u0117 Tatyana Ovechkina Angel\u0117 Rup\u0161ien\u0117 Lyubov Sharmay Uljana Semjonova Tetiana Nadyrova Olga Sukharnova Nadezhda Shuvayeva-Olkhova Lyudmila Rogozhina | valign=top | Krasimira Bogdanova Vanya Dermendzhieva Silviya Germanova Petkana Makaveeva Nadka Golcheva Penka Stoyanova Evladiya Slavcheva Kostadinka Radkova Snezhana Mikhaylova Angelina Mikhaylova Penka Metodieva Diana Dilova | valign=top | Vera \u0110ura\u0161kovi\u0107 Mersada Be\u0107irspahi\u0107 Jelica Komnenovi\u0107 Mira Bjedov Vukica Miti\u0107 Sanja O\u017eegovi\u0107 Sofija Peki\u0107 Marija Tonkovi\u0107 Zorica \u0110urkovi\u0107 Vesna Despotovi\u0107 Biljana Majstorovi\u0107 Jasmina Perazi\u0107 |} ==Qualification== An NOC may enter up to one men's team with 12 players and up to one women's team with 12 players.

The Soviet Union then won the bronze against Spain. Yugoslavia earned their first and only gold medal in men's basketball at this Olympic Games. Results from Yugoslavia vs. Spain, Italy vs. Cuba and Soviet Union vs. Brazil were carried over from the preliminary round. {| class=\"infobox bordered\" |- |width=10px bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"| ||Competed for the gold medal |- |width=10px bgcolor=\"#ffdab9\"| ||Competed for the bronze medal |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=130|Team !width=20| !width=20| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=20|Pts !width=50| |-bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| || 5 || 0 || 506 || 442 || +64 || 10 || |-bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\" |align=left| || 3 || 2 || 419 || 438 || \u221219 || 8 || 1W\u20130L |-bgcolor=\"#ffdab9\" |align=left| || 3 || 2 || 505 || 468 || +37 || 8 || 0W\u20131L |-bgcolor=\"#ffdab9\" |align=left| || 2 || 3 || 488 || 485 || +3 || 7 || 1W\u20130L |- |align=left| || 2 || 3 || 448 || 477 || \u221229 || 7 || 0W\u20131L |- |align=left| || 0 || 5 || 434 || 490 || \u221256 || 5 || |} ===Medal matches=== Bronze Medal Gold Medal ==Women's tournament== The women's tournament was decided in a round robin group with all six teams.
