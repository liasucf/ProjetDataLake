    "text": "Es'hail 2 is a Qatari satellite, launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on November 15, 2018. Es'hail 2 was built by Japan's Mitsubishi Electric company, and will operate at 26\u00b0 East longitude along a geostationary orbit to provide direct-to-home television services in the Middle East and North Africa region. The satellite will feature 24 Ku-band and 11 Ka-band transponders to provide direct broadcasting services for television, government and commercial content distribution. In addition to commercial services, the payload of Es'hail 2 includes a linear transponder with a bandwidth of 250 kHz and 8MHz for the amateur radio satellite service, with uplink on 2.4 GHz (S band) and downlink on 10.45 GHz (X band). == Amateur radio transponders == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=2 | Transponder !colspan=4 | U/L FREQUENCY [MHz] !colspan=4 | D/L FREQUENCY [MHz] !rowspan=2 | LO [MHz] !rowspan=2 | BW [MHz] |- !Pol !Begin !Center !End !Pol !Begin !Center !End |- |NB |RHCP |2400,05 |2400,175 |2400,3 |V |10489,55 |10489,675 |10489,8 |8089,5 |0,25 |- |WB |RHCP |2401,5 |2405,5 |2409,5 |H |10491 |10495 |10499 |8089,5 |8 |- | colspan=\"11\" |References: |} === \"NB\" Transponder (narrow band) === Linear Transponder for low power narrow bandwidth voice, morse and digital communication * preferred modes: narrow band modes like SSB and CW, PSK * 250 kHz allocated bandwidth * non-inverting bent-pipe transponder * Assumes 50 simultaneous 2-way carriers to serve 100 Users * X-Band Downlink (SAT-TV dish): ** 90 cm dishes in rainy areas at EOC like Brazil or Thailand ** 60 cm around coverage peak ** 75 cm dishes at peak -2dB * Downlink Polarisation on X-Band is Vertical ! * Uplink Polarisation on S-Band is RHCP * Uplink transmitter 5-10W PEP (22.5 dBi antenna gain, 75cm dish) The narrowband transponder is intended for conventional analogue and narrowband digital signals. No transmissions should be made beyond the nominal edges of the transponder passbands. In particular, no operation should take place below the lower beacon nor above the upper beacon. No uplinks should result in downlink signals that are stronger than these beacons. In the event that such signals are detected, they will be marked by a \u201cLEILA\u201d siren. When they have been marked by \u201cLEILA\u201d, operators should immediately reduce their uplink power (ERP). No FM transmissions should be made to Es\u2019hail-2 as these would use excessive power and bandwidth. Although there is no formal bandplan, the following details are provided for initial guidance. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Uplink [MHz] !Downlink [MHz] !available Bandwidth [kHz] !Notes |- | |10489,550 \u2013 10489,555 |do not transmit |Lower Beacon, 400 Bit/s BPSK or CW |- |2400,055 \u2013 2400,100 |10489,555 \u2013 10489,600 |45 |CW Only |- |2400,100 \u2013 2400,120 |10489,600 \u2013 10489,620 |20 |narrowband digimodes (500 Hz max.
