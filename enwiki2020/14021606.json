He helped found the Society for Political Education and its magazine \"Nihonjin\" (Japanese People). In 1907 the Nihonjin Magazine was renamed \"Nihon Oyobi Nihonjin\" (Japan and The Japanese People). It was at this time that Hasegawa Nyozekan was recruited to the magazine. Miyake's other works included \"Shinzenbi Nihonjin\" (Goodness, truth and beauty of The Japanese People) and \"Giakushu Nihonjin\" (Falsehoods, evil and ugliness of the Japanese People). ==Political views== Miyake was a Cooperative Nationalist and differed in opinion from Universalists. He felt that Japan was first a member of the Asian community and secondly a member of the global community. Also Japan should hold onto and preserve its cultural heritage from before the Meiji era as it helped to strengthen Asian culture and, by doing so, world culture. Miyake felt Japan should make it its mission to study Asia, oppose western imperialism, and nurture the distinctive Japanese sense of beauty. ==References== *Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures *Making Japanese - Chapter Three: Culture Wars ==External links== * Category:1860 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Kanazawa, Ishikawa Category:Japanese philosophers Category:Japanese journalists Category:Recipients of the Order of Culture ",
