    "text": "The 2017 FIVB Volleyball Women's U23 World Championship was the third and final edition of the international volleyball tournament and the world championship for women's national teams under the age of 23, organized by the sport's world governing body, FIVB. The tournament was hosted by Slovenia in the city of Ljubljana from 10 September to 17 September 2017. 12 teams from the 5 confederations competed in the tournament. Turkey defeated the home team in straight sets in the final to claim their first title in the competition. Bulgaria won the bronze medal outclassing Dominican Republic 4\u20132. Hande Balad\u0131n from Turkey was elected the MVP. After this tournament, FIVB declared that \"As per decision of May 2019 FIVB Board of Administration, the U23 WCH has been abolished.\" == Qualification == The FIVB Sports Events Council revealed a proposal to streamline the number of teams participating in the Age Group World Championships. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=910 |- !width=30% colspan=\"2\"|Means of Qualification!!width=21%|Date!!width=19%|Venue!!width=6%|Vacancies!!width=19%|Qualifier |- |colspan=\"2\"|Host Nation||2 February 2016|| Lausanne||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2016 European Qualifiers||rowspan=\"2\"|27\u201331 July 2016||rowspan=\"2\"| Vrnja\u010dka Banja||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\"|2016 South American Championship||27\u201331 July 2016||rowspan=\"4\"| Lima|| align=\"center\"|1|| |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2016 Pan-American Cup||For CSV||rowspan=\"3\"|19\u201325 September 2016||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |rowspan=\"2\"|For NORCECA||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2016 African Championship||rowspan=\"2\"|23\u201327 October 2016||rowspan=\"2\"| Kasarani||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2017 Asian Championship||rowspan=\"2\"|13\u201321 May 2017||rowspan=\"2\"| Nakhon Ratchasima||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\"|World Ranking||As per 1 January 2017|| Lausanne||align=\"center\"|1|| |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total!!12!! |} ==Pools composition== Teams were seeded following the Serpentine system according to their FIVB World Rankings as of January 2017.

Matches in Ljubljana will be played to best-of-seven sets with each set to 15 points (with at least a two-point difference needed). Three ranking points will be awarded to teams winning 4\u20130, 4\u20131 or 4\u20132. Two points go the winner of a 4\u20133 match with one point for the loser. It is hoped that the new scoring system will reduce overall duration of matches, while making each set more attractive and exciting \u2013 much as tie-breaks are under the current regulations. The interval between sets is reduced to two minutes (from three). Teams will switch ends after the second set - and also, if needed, after sets 4, 5 and 6. In addition, there will be no technical timeouts \u2013 just two regular thirty-second timeouts per team per set. The basic principles for the new scheme were tested for the first time in the Dutch League in the 2016\u201317 season. Further testing of the scheme were conducted at the Women's U23 World Championship in Cairo. During and after the competition, players, coaches, referees and officials will be evaluating the new system through a questionnaire, while duration and scoring statistics will be gathered and analysed. This is the second time that a U23 World Championship serves as a testbed for new regulations. Matches of the inaugural Men's U23 World Championship in 2013 in Uberl\u00e2ndia were played to 21-point sets. In addition to the scoring system, a new serving regulation will be tried out in Cairo, with the server not allowed to land inside the court after a jump service. The testing of the new rules has been received with criticism from the volleyball community. ==Pool standing procedure== # Number of matches won # Match points # Sets ratio # Points ratio # Result of the last match between the tied teams Match won 4\u20130 , 4\u20131 or 4\u20132: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser Match won 4\u20133: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser ==Preliminary round== *All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |width=10px bgcolor=#ccffcc| ||Qualified for the Semifinals |- |width=10px bgcolor=#dfefff| ||Qualified for the 5th\u20138th semifinals |} ===Pool A=== ===Pool B=== ==Final round== *All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00). ===5th\u20138th places=== ====5th\u20138th semifinals==== ====7th place match==== ====5th place match==== ===Final four=== ====Semifinals==== ====3rd place match==== ====Final==== ==Final standing== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=40|Rank !width=180|Team |- | |align=left| |- | |align=left| |- | |align=left| |- |4 |align=left| |- |5 |align=left| |- |6 |align=left| |- |7 |align=left| |- |8 |align=left| |- |rowspan=2|9 |align=left| |- |align=left| |- |rowspan=2|11 |align=left| |- |align=left| |} {| style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" |- |12\u2013woman Roster |- |Tu\u011fba Seno\u011flu, Beyza Arici, Ay\u00e7a Ayka\u00e7, \u00c7a\u011fla Ak\u0131n (c), Asl\u0131 Kala\u00e7, Ezgi Dilik, Bihter Dumano\u011flu, Hande Balad\u0131n, Saliha Sahin, Nursevil Aydinlar, Zehra G\u00fcne\u015f, Ebrar Karakurt |- |Head Coach |- |Ataman Guneyligil |} ==Awards== *Most Valuable Player : Hande Balad\u0131n *Best Setter : Eva Mori *Best Outside Spikers : Hande Balad\u0131n : Madeline Guill\u00e9n *Best Middle Blockers : Beyza Arici : Sa\u0161a Planin\u0161ec *Best Opposite Spiker : Iza Mlakar *Best Libero : Zhana Todorova == See also == * 2017 FIVB Volleyball Men's U23 World Championship == References == == External links == * Official website Category:FIVB Volleyball Women's U23 World Championship FIVB Volleyball Women's U23 World Championship Category:International volleyball competitions hosted by Slovenia Category:2017 in Slovenian women's sport Category:September 2017 sports events in Europe Category:Sport in Ljubljana ",
