    "text": "The Canadian Basketball League (CBL) was a professional basketball minor league based around the Greater Toronto Area of Southern Ontario. The CBL was founded in July 2014 by former NBA coach Butch Carter. ==History== The four founding member teams were Durham United, Hamilton United, Scarborough and Wellington. Teams play a 24-game regular season followed by league playoffs. The CBL was to begin play for the 2015\u201316 season with four teams. That plan was put on hold when a home arena could not be secured for the Hamilton franchise. CBL began their inaugural season in December 2016. Scarborough defeated Wellington 79-75 in the first-ever league game played at the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre on December 18, 2016. The league lasted one season and ceased operations in March 2017. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Team !City !Arena |- |Durham United Basketball Club |Oshawa, Ontario |Durham Campus Recreation & Wellness Centre |- |Hamilton United Basketball Club |Hamilton, Ontario |David Braley Athletics & Recreation Centre |- |Scarborough Basketball Club |Toronto, Ontario |Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre |- |Wellington Basketball Club |Guelph, Ontario |Guelph Gryphons Athletic Centre |} ==References== ==External links== * CBL official website Category:Professional sports leagues in Canada Category:Basketball leagues in Canada Category:2014 establishments in Ontario Category:2017 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Sports leagues established in 2014 Category:Sports leagues disestablished in 2017 ",
