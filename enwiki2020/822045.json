    "text": "In Islamic jurisprudence, qiy\u0101s () is the process of deductive analogy in which the teachings of the hadith are compared and contrasted with those of the Qur'an, in order to apply a known injunction (nass) to a new circumstance and create a new injunction. Here the ruling of the Sunnah and the Qur'an may be used as a means to solve or provide a response to a new problem that may arise. This, however, is only the case providing that the set precedent or paradigm and the new problem that has come about will share operative causes (, \u02bfillah). The \u02bfillah is the specific set of circumstances that trigger a certain law into action. An example of the use of qiy\u0101s is the case of the ban on selling or buying of goods after the last call for Friday prayers until the end of the prayer stated in the . By analogy this prohibition is extended to other transactions and activities such as agricultural work and administration. Among Sunni Muslim in recent centuries Qiyas has been accepted as a fundamental source of Sharia law along with Ijm\u0101\u02bf and secondary to the Qur'an, and the Sunnah. ==Sunni interpretations== Late and modern Sunni jurisprudence regards analogical reason as a fourth source of Islamic law, following the Qur'an, prophetic tradition and binding consensus. While Muslim scholarship in the later period traditionally claimed that analogy had existed in Islamic law since their religion's inception,Wal\u00eed b. Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem al-`Ujaj\u00ee, Qiyas in Islamic Law \u2013 A Brief Introduction, Alfalah Consulting, FRIDAY, 29 APRIL 2011 modern scholarship generally points to Muslim scholar Abu Hanifa as the first to incorporate analogical reason as a source of law.Reuben Levy, Introduction to the Sociology of Islam, pg. 236-237.

Imam Bukhari, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and Dawud al-Zahiri for example, rejected the use of analogical reason outright, arguing that to rely on personal opinion in law-making would mean that each individual would ultimately form their own subjective conclusions.Chiragh Ali, pg. 281. Bernard G. Weiss, one of today's foremost experts on Islamic law and philosophy, explains that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations, its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists.Bernard G. Weiss, The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al- Amidi, pg. 633. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1992. Thus, while its status as a fourth source of law was accepted by the majority of later and modern Muslim jurists, this was not the case at the inception of Muslim jurisprudence as a field. Opposition to qiyas came from a number of angles. Professor Wal\u00eed b. Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem al-`Ujaj\u00ee Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University explains the opposition to qiyas as coming from multiple angles: :Some of them argued that qiy\u00e2s is contrary to reason. One argument given in this light was that: \u201cDelving into this method is intellectually repugnant in its own right\u201d. Another argument was: \u201cIslamic legal rulings are based on human well-being, and no one knows human well-being except the One who gave us the sacred law. Therefore, the only way we can know the sacred law is from the revelation.\u201d Other scholars said that qiy\u00e2s is not contrary to reason, but prohibited by the sacred law itself. Scott Lucas, when mentioning Ahmad Dallal\u2019s position on Salafism, states that Dallal: :...declared that Salafism \"is better understood as a method of thinking of, or an approach to, authoritative sources than as a distinct school of thought\" that includes the elevation of the Qur\u2019an and sound hadith at the expense of the opinions attributed to the eponyms of the four Sunni schools and the rejection (or sever curtailment) of qiyas ==== Imam Bukhari ==== Imam Bukhari maintained a negative position towards qiyas, as he held views aligned with the Zahiris of his time. Scott Lucas states that Bukhari\u2019s rejection of qiyas was placed within the context of what Bukhari perceived as invalid techniques of ijtihad, which included religious innovation (bid\u2019a), ra\u2019y, and tamthil. Lucas also points out common mistakes other scholars make when analyzing Bukhari\u2019s position on qiyas. The biggest source of confusion for scholars is the fact that, while rejecting qiyas, Bukhari accepts the idea of tashbih (comparison), which seems similar to analogy. However, this is not the case, as tashbih is a comparison used in explanation (such as a metaphor), whereas qiyas applies a specific legal ruling to another case. Bukhari is also known for his criticism of those who say that the Prophet used qiyas, and he devoted a section of his Sahih to the topic. Bukhari states: :If the Prophet was asked about something about which he had not received a revelation, he either said, \u2018I do not know\u2019 or did not reply until he received a revelation. he did not [reply] by means of ra\u2019y or qiyas, due to the [Qur\u2019anic] verse, \"\u2026in accordance to what God has shown you\" (4:105). ==== Ahmad Ibn Hanbal ==== On Ahmad's views, Christopher Melchert states \u201cAhmad and his fellow traditionalists of the ninth century expressly condemned the Hanafi exercise of qiyas\u2026\u201d When compared with Dawud al-Zahiri's intensely negative stance towards qiyas, Melchert also states \u201cAhmad ibn Hanbal could likewise be quoted, as we have seen, in total rejection of ra\u2019y (opinion) and qiyas (analogy).\" Ahmad ibn Hanbal has been quoted as saying \"There is no qiyas in the Sunnah, and examples are not to be made up for it\u201d ==== Support for its validity ==== Early support for the validity of analogical reason in jurisprudence came from Abu Hanifa and his student Abu Yusuf. Al-Shafi'i was a proponent of analogical reasoning as well, though his usage was less frequent than that of Abu Hanifa. Acceptance of analogical reason gradually increased within the Muslim world. With the Malikite and Hanbalite schools eventually granting full acceptance as the Hanafites and Shafi'ites already had done, the overwhelming majority of Sunni jurists from the late period onward affirmed its validity. Japanese scholar of Islam Kojiro Nakamura defined the orthodox Sunni schools in regard to their eventual acceptance of analogy in descending order of that acceptance: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is, Hanbalis and Zahiris. Much work was performed on the details of proper analogy, with major figures such as Al-Qastallani, Al- Baqillani, Al-Juwayni and al-Amidi from the Shafi'ite school and Ibn Abidin from the Hanafite school providing rules and guidelines still used to this day. ===Application as a source of law=== Sunni scholar Baghawi gave a commonly accepted definition of analogy in Islamic law: analogical reasoning is the knowledge by which one learns the method of deriving a ruling from the Quran and prophetic tradition. In this case, the above-mentioned ruling should not already be apparent in the Quran, prophetic tradition or consensus. If there is no derivation involved due to the explicitness of the ruling in the Quran and prophetic tradition, then such a person is not, by definition, a mujtahid. ==Shi\u2019a interpretations== Not unlike the Sunni Hanbalis and Zahiris, the Shi\u2019a rejected both pure reason and analogical reason completely on account of the multitude of perspectives that would arise from it, viewing both methods as subjective. There are various instances in which the Qur'an disapproves of a divergence of beliefs such as the following: ===Twelver Shi\u2019a=== Within the Twelver Shi\u2019i legal tradition, the fourth source for deriving legal principles is not qiy\u0101s but rather the intellect \u2019\u2019'Aql\u2019\u2019. Twelver Shi\u2019a regard the ulama (scholars) as authorities in legal and religious matters during the Occultation (ghayba) of the Imamah Mahdi. Until the return of the hidden Imam, it is the responsibility of the ul\u0101ma\u2019 to be his deputies and provide guidance on worldly matters. In modern interpretations of Twelver Shi\u2019ism, the most revered and learned scholars are styled as references for emulation (marja taql\u012bd). This system of deriving legal principles effectively replaces both the Sunni notion of consensus (ijm\u0101\u2019) and deductive analogy (qiy\u0101s)Elhadj, Elie. The Islamic Shield: Arab Resistance to Democratic and Religious Reforms (Boca Raton: Brown Walker Press), 2007, p.48. Accordingly, in the chapter on Knowledge of the Twelver collection of prophetic traditions, Kitab al-Kafi, one finds many traditions cited from the Imams that forbid the use of qiy\u0101s, for example: ===Ismaili Shi\u2019a=== Among the most notable Ismaili thinkers, Bu Ishaq Quhistani regarded the notion of subjective opinion (qiy\u0101s) as completely contradictory to the Islamic notion of tawh\u012bd (unity) as it ultimately gave rise to a countless divergent conclusions, besides which those who exercised deductive analogy relied on little more than their imperfect individual intellects. According to Bu Ishaq, there must be a supreme intellect in every age, just as Muhammad was in his time. Without this, it would be impossible for any ordinary individual to attain knowledge of the Divine using mere speculation. The supreme intellect, he reasoned, could be none other than the Imam of the age.Shafique Virani. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.149. Bu Ishaq Quhistani referred to the Qur'anic tale of Adam and Eve to support his argument for the necessity of a perfect teacher who could provide spiritual edification (ta\u2019l\u012bm) in place of what he felt were subjective whims and wayward personal opinions (ra\u2019y). Commenting on the Qur'anic foundational narrative, Bu Ishaq explains that when God taught Adam the names of all things, Adam was commanded to teach the angels, as in sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayah 33. Spiritual instruction therefore had its root in the Qur'an itself, however Satan, in his arrogance, refused to bow down before Adam. Instead he protested, \"I am better than he. You created me from fire and him from clay.\" Thus the first to use deductive analogy was none other than Satan himself, by reasoning and challenging the command of God to prostrate. It was for this reason that Satan was punished for eternity and fell from favor until the final day.Virani, p.152. In Ismaili thought, therefore, the truth lay not in subjective opinion (ra\u2019y) and analogy (qiy\u0101s), but rather in the teaching of the bearer of truth (muhiqq), that is, the Imam of the time. The supreme teacher therefore exists at all times for the imperfect human intellects to submit (tasl\u012bm) to, as is proclaimed in the divine dictate: ==Mu'tazilite interpretations== Primarily being a school of theology and not jurisprudence, the Mu'tazila generally did not hold independent positions on such issues. The majority of the Mu'tazila, despite being a distinct sect from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam, still preferred the juristic school of Abu Hanifa, with a minority following Al-Shafi'i's views. This resulted in the odd combination of being Mu'tazilite in creed but Sunni in jurisprudence, and consequently most of the Mu'tazila accepted analogical reason in addition to pure reason.Joseph A. Kechichian, A mind of his own. Gulf News: 21:30 December 20, 2012. Mu'tazilite scholar Abu'l Husayn al-Basri, a major contributor to early Muslim jurisprudence, said that in order for a jurist to perform analogical reason, they must possess a thorough knowledge of the rules and procedures for which allows the application of revealed law to an unprecedented case, in addition to basic knowledge of the Qur'an and prophetic tradition. Not all of the Mu'tazila followed Sunni jurisprudence. Al-Nazzam in particular denied the validity of analogical reason wholesale, preferring to rely on pure reason instead. == Qiyas and the Inquisition (Mihna) == The Inquisition that took place in the middle of the 9th century, which was initiated by the caliph al-Ma\u2019mun, ensured the persecution of many scholars who did not agree with the caliph\u2019s rationalistic views. The most famous of these persecuted scholars is Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who maintained his view that the Qur'an was not created, but eternal. Wael Hallaq argues that the Mihna was not just about whether or not the Qur'an was created. The issues of ra\u2019y, qiyas, and rationalism were all represented within the Inquisition, and Hallaq states \u201cThe Mihna thus brought to a climax the struggle between two opposing movements: the traditionalists, whose cause Ibn Hanbal was seen to champion; and the rationalists, headed by the caliphs and the Mu\u2019tazilites, among whom there were many Hanafites\u201d Christopher Melchert similarly argues that the Mihna demonstrated a relationship between the Hanafis of Baghdad, who were associated with the heavy use of qiyas, and the Mu\u2019tazilites. ==Historical debate== Before the Middle Ages there was a logical debate among Islamic logicians, philosophers and theologians over whether the term qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111) and Ibn Qud\u0101mah al-Maqd\u012bs\u012b (1147-1223) argued that qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.Wael Hallaq (1993), Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians, p. 48.
