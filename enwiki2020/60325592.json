It was held from 2 to 12 April 2019, with all the matches played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) stated that the top performers in the tournament would be considered for the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England. Federal Areas were the defending champions, but they lost their first three matches of the tournament, therefore eliminating them from competition. On 9 April 2019, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa beat Sindh by nine runs to advance to the final of the tournament. The result meant that Baluchistan also progressed to the final, regardless of the outcome of their last match against Federal Areas. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa won the tournament, to win their second title, after beating Balochistan by nine runs in the final. ==Squads== Prior to the start of the tournament, the PCB named the following squads: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=330 | Baluchistan ! width=330 | Federal Areas ! width=330 | Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ! width=330 | Punjab ! width=330 | Sindh |- |valign=top| * Asad Shafiq (c) * Ali Imran * Ammad Butt * Awais Zia * Bismillah Khan (wk) * Fawad Alam * Ghulam Mudassar * Haris Rauf * Mohammad Irfan * Qaiser Ashraf * Taj Wali * Umer Khan * Umar Akmal * Waqar Hussain (wk) * Zeeshan Ashraf |valign=top| * Mohammad Rizwan (c, wk) * Ahmed Shehzad * Asad Afridi * Bilal Asif * Israrullah * Khurram Shahzad * Mohammad Nawaz * Nihal Mansoor * Ramiz Raja * Rumman Raees * Sameen Gul * Saud Shakil * Sohaib Maqsood * Waqas Maqsood * Zia-ul-Haq |valign=top| * Salman Butt (c) * Abid Ali * Adil Amin * Adnan Akmal (wk) * Faizan Riaz * Khushdil Shah * Mohammad Irfan * Mohammad Irfan * Mohammad Saad * Sohail Khan * Musa Khan * Umaid Asif * Wahab Riaz * Zeeshan Malik * Zohaib Khan |valign=top| * Kamran Akmal (c, wk) * Anwar Ali * Bilawal Bhatti * Ehsan Adil * Fahad Iqbal * Iftikhar Ahmed * Kashif Bhatti * Khurram Manzoor * Mohammad Asghar * Mohammad Sami * Ramiz Aziz * Saad Ali * Sami Aslam * Sohail Tanveer * Waleed Ahmed |valign=top| * Umer Gul (c) * Ahsan Ali * Amir Yamin * Ashiq Ali * Asif Ali * Hammad Azam * Imran Rafiq * Mohammad Hasan (wk) * Mohammad Hasnain * Mohammad Ilyas * Nauman Ali * Rahat Ali * Sahibzada Farhan * Umar Amin * Umar Siddique (wk) |} ==Points table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:175px;\"|Teams ! style=\"width:20px;\"| ! style=\"width:20px;\"| ! style=\"width:20px;\"| ! style=\"width:20px;\"| ! style=\"width:20px;\"| ! style=\"width:45px;\"| |-style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text-align:left\" |Baluchistan | 4 || 3 || 0 || 1 || 7 || +0.817 |-style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text-align:left\" |Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | 4 || 3 || 0 || 1 || 7 || +0.267 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" |Punjab | 4 || 2 || 2 || 0 || 4 || +0.297 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" |Sindh | 4 || 1 || 3 || 0 || 2 || \u20130.386 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" |Federal Areas | 4 || 0 || 4 || 0 || 0 || \u20130.714 |} Teams qualified for the final ==Fixtures== The fixtures were confirmed by the PCB: ===Round-robin=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Final== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricino Cup Cup Cup Category:April 2019 sports events in Asia Category:21st century in Rawalpindi Category:Cricket in Rawalpindi Category:National One Day Championship 2019 2019 Cup ",
