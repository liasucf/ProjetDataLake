    "text": "Night Moves is the ninth studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bob Seger, and his first studio album to credit the Silver Bullet Band. The album was released on October 22, 1976 by Capitol Records. Although the front cover only credits backing by the Silver Bullet Band, four of the nine songs on the album feature backing by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The album was well received by critics and gave Bob Seger nationwide success. Three singles were released from the album, with two of them making the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album became Seger's second to become certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and was his first to be certified platinum by the same association. It later achieved a certification of sextuple platinum. == Reception == Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote that the riffs on Night Moves are classic rock and roll riffs, like those performed by Chuck Berry or the Rolling Stones, and that the album is about rock and roll for those who are no longer in their teens, like the song \"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\". The Rolling Stone review of the album by Kit Rachlis stated that the album is one of the best to come out of 1976-77, that Seger sounds like Rod Stewart and writes lyrics like Bruce Springsteen, and that album is classic rock and roll. The only problem that Rachlis had with the album was the production not being strong enough. A later review of the album by Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic says that the album was very similar to Beautiful Loser (1975), but Night Moves is harder than Beautiful Loser. Erlewine also feels that the album has a wide range of styles and has not lost any of its influence years later. == Track listing == * Side one tracks 1, 3, & 4 and side two track 5 were recorded by the Silver Bullet Band in Detroit. * Track 2 was recorded in Toronto. * Side two tracks 1 \u2013 4 were recorded by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield, Alabama. == Personnel == Track numbering below refers to CD and digital releases of the album. === Musicians === ;All tracks * Bob Seger \u2013 vocals, guitar, production ;The Silver Bullet Band Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band - Night Moves (1976) album releases & credits at Discogs.com * Drew Abbott \u2013 guitar (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9); background vocals on \"Mary Lou\" (track 9) * Robyn Robbins \u2013 piano, organ (tracks 1, 3, 4, 9) * Alto Reed \u2013 tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, flute (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 9) * Chris Campbell \u2013 bass (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 9); background vocals on \"Mary Lou\" (track 9) * Charlie Allen Martin \u2013 drums, tambourine, maracas (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 9); background vocals on \"Mary Lou\" (track 9) ;Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section * Pete Carr \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, production (tracks 5, 6, 7, 8) * Jimmy Johnson \u2013 rhythm guitar, production (tracks 5, 6, 7, 8) * Barry Beckett \u2013 piano, organ, ARP synthesizer, clavinet, melodica, production (tracks 5, 6, 7, 8) * David Hood \u2013 bass, production (tracks 5, 6, 7, 8) * Roger Hawkins \u2013 drums, tambourine, maracas, congas, timpani, production (tracks 5, 6, 7, 8) ;Additional musicians * Jerry Luck \u2013 accordion on \"Ship of Fools\" (track 8) * Joe Miquelon \u2013 guitar on \"Night Moves\" (track 2) * Doug Riley \u2013 piano, organ on \"Night Moves\" (track 2) * Sharon Lee Williams \u2013 backing vocals on \"Night Moves\" (track 2) * Rhonda Silver \u2013 backing vocals on \"Night Moves\" (track 2) * Laurel Ward \u2013 backing vocals on \"Night Moves\" (track 2) === Production === * Punch Andrews \u2013 production (tracks 1, 3, 4, 9) * Jack Richardson \u2013 production (track 2) * Jim Bruzzese \u2013 recording engineer, mixing engineer * Brian Christian \u2013 recording engineer * Jerry Masters \u2013 recording engineer * Steve Melton \u2013 recording engineer * Greg Miller \u2013 recording engineer * Wally Traugott \u2013 mastering engineer * Tom Bert \u2013 photography == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1977) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\" | Canada Top Albums (RPM) |align=\"center\"|12 |- !scope=\"row\" | US Top LPs & Tape (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|8 |} == Certifications == == References == == External links == * Official website * Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band - Night Moves (1976) album review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, credits & releases at AllMusic.com * Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band - Night Moves (1976) album releases & credits at Discogs.com * Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band - Night Moves (1976) album to be listened as stream at Spotify.com Category:Bob Seger albums Category:1976 albums Category:Albums produced by Punch Andrews Category:Albums produced by Jack Richardson (record producer) Category:Albums recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio Category:Capitol Records albums ",
