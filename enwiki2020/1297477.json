    "text": "\u00cele Saint-Paul (Saint Paul Island) is an island forming part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (Terres australes et antarctiques fran\u00e7aises, TAAF) in the Indian Ocean, with an area of . The island is located about south of the larger \u00cele Amsterdam (), northeast of the Kerguelen Islands, and southeast of R\u00e9union. It is the nearest landfall (355 km. / 220 mi.) to the antipode of the geographic center of the contiguous United States. It is an important breeding site for seabirds. A scientific research cabin on the island is used for scientific or ecological short campaigns, but there is no permanent population. It is under the authority of a senior administrator on R\u00e9union. == Description == \u00cele Saint-Paul is triangular in shape, and measures no more than at its widest. It is the top of an active volcano; the volcano last erupted in 1793 (from its SW Flank), and is rocky with steep cliffs on the east side. The thin stretch of rock that used to close off the crater collapsed in 1780, admitting the sea through a channel; the entrance is only a few meters deep, thus allowing only very small ships or boats to enter the crater. The interior basin, wide and deep, is surrounded by steep walls up to high. There are active thermal springs. == History == ===Early sightings=== \u00cele Saint-Paul was first discovered in 1559 by the Portuguese. The island was mapped, described in detail and recorded in paintings by members of the crew of the Nau S\u00e3o Paulo, among them the Father Manuel \u00c1lvares and the chemist Henrique Dias. \u00c1lvares and Dias correctly calculated the latitude as 38\u00b0 South. The ship was commanded by Rui Melo da C\u00e2mara and was part of the Portuguese India Armada commanded by Jorge de Sousa. The S\u00e3o Paulo, which also carried women and had sailed from Europe and stopped in Brazil, would be the subject of a dramatic and moving story of survival after it sank south of Sumatra. The next confirmed sighting was made by Dutchman Harwick Claesz de Hillegom on 19 April 1618. There were further sightings on the island through the 17th century. One of the first detailed descriptions of it, and possibly the first landing, was made in December 1696 by Willem de Vlamingh. ===19th century=== During sailing-ship days captains would occasionally use the island as a check on their navigation before heading north. Saint-Paul was occasionally visited by explorers, fishermen, and seal hunters in the 18th and 19th centuries, among which was the American sealer General Gates, which called at the island in April 1819. George William Robinson, an American sealer, was left on the island to hunt seals, and stayed there for 23 months until the General Gates returned for him in March 1821. Robinson subsequently returned to Saint-Paul in 1826 to gather sealskin, sailing from Hobart aboard his own vessel, the schooner Hunter. The sealing period lasted from 1789 to 1876. Sealing visits are recorded by 60 vessels, four of which ended in shipwreck. Sealing era relics include the ruins of huts and inscriptions.R.K. Headland, Historical Antarctic sealing industry, Scott Polar Research Institute (Cambridge University), 2018, p.168, France's claim to the island dates from 1843, when a group of fishermen from R\u00e9union, interested in setting up a fishery on Saint-Paul, pressed the Governor of R\u00e9union to take possession of both Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island. This was performed by means of an official decree dated 8 June 1843, and on 1 July, Martin Dupeyrat, commanding the ship L'Olympe, landed on Amsterdam Island and then on Saint-Paul on 3 July, and hoisted the tricolor. The only surviving evidence of this claim is an inscribed rock situated on the edge of Saint-Paul's crater lake, inscribed \"Pellefournier Emile Mazarin de Noyarez, Grenoble, Canton de Sassenage, D\u00e9partement de l'Is\u00e8re, 1844\". All fishery operations were, however, abandoned in 1853, when the French government renounced its possession of the two islands. The first good map of the island was not drawn up until 1857, when the Austrian frigate Novara landed a team which studied the flora, fauna, and geology from November to December.An account of the voyage was published in English, and digitized copies are available online from several sources. From Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e Jos\u00e9 Mindlin (monochrome): BBM , Wikimedia Commons . From Library (colour): . Austrian Literature Online: ALO (monochrome, with some plates in colour) , Project Gutenberg (transcript) . HMS Megaera at St Paul Island. In 1871, a British troop transport, HMS Megaera, was wrecked on the island. Most of the 400 persons on board had to remain upwards of three months before being taken off. A short, impressionistic account of the two French residents encountered by the shipwrecked crew appears in Judith Schalansky's Atlas of Remote Islands (2010). In September 1874, a French astronomical mission conveyed by the sailing ship La Dive spent just over three months on Saint-Paul to observe the transit of Venus; geologist Charles V\u00e9lain took the opportunity to make a significant geological survey of the island. In 1889, Charles Lightoller, who was later to become famous as the Second Officer of the RMS Titanic, was shipwrecked here for eight days when the sailing barque Holt Hill ran aground. He describes the shipwreck and the island in his autobiography, Titanic and Other Ships. Lightoller speculated that pirates used the island and their treasure could be buried in its caves. In 1892, the crew of the French sloop Bourdonnais, followed by the ship L'Eure in 1893, again took possession of Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island in the name of the French government. ===20th century=== In 1928, the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des \u00cdles Kerguelen recruited Ren\u00e9 Bossi\u00e8re and several Bretons and Madagascans to establish a spiny lobster cannery on Saint-Paul, \"La Langouste Fran\u00e7aise\". In March 1930, at the end of the second season, most of the employees left, but seven of them stayed on the island to guard the installations, supposedly for just a few months. But the promised relief arrived much too late. When the ship finally came, in December 1930, five people had died, mostly from lack of food and scurvy: Paule Brunou (a child born on the island who died two months after her birth), Emmanuel Puloc'h, Fran\u00e7ois Ramamonzi, Victor Brunou, and Pierre Quillivic. Only three survivors were rescued. This event has since come to be known as Les Oubli\u00e9s de Saint-Paul (\"the forgotten ones of St. Paul\").Les oubli\u00e9s de l'\u00eele Saint- Paul, by Daniel Floch. 1982. A few years later in 1938, the crew of a French fishing boat was stranded on the island. Distress calls sent by the crew over short-wave radio were fortuitously received 11,000 miles away in the United States. The message was relayed to the Navy and the French consul in San Francisco, while 12-year-old Neil Taylor, an amateur radio operator in California, made contact with the stranded crew and assured them that help was on the way. == Environment == The island has a cool oceanic climate and the slopes of the volcano are covered in grass. It is a breeding site for subantarctic fur seals, southern elephant seals and rockhopper penguins. It was also the breeding site for an endemic flightless duck & several kinds of petrel before the introduction of exotic predators and herbivores, including black rats, house mice, European rabbits, pigs and goats during the 19th century or earlier. The pigs and goats have since disappeared or been eradicated. Black rats were eradicated in January 1997 following an aerial drop of 13.5 tonnes of brodifacoum anticoagulant poison baits over the island.Micol & Jouventin (2002). ===Important Bird Area=== The island, with the adjacent islet of Quille Rock, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports several breeding seabirds. The island's subtropical location gives it an avifauna distinct from that of subantarctic islands and contains several breeding species which are rare in the region. Saint Paul's seabirds nested mainly on Quille Rock until rat eradication allowed some species, notably Macgillivray's prions (a subspecies of Salvin's prion) and great-winged petrels, to recolonise the main island. Other species include a colony of some 9000 pairs of northern rockhopper penguins, about 20 pairs of sooty albatrosses, a few pairs of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, and small numbers of Australasian gannets, fairy prions, little and flesh-footed shearwaters, Wilson's storm petrels and sooty terns. The island might once have had a species of duck as a painting from 1793 shows one. However, it is not clear if this is conspecific with the Amsterdam duck (Anas marecula) or a separate taxon. No specimens have been found though, so the existence of this cannot be proven.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: \u00cele Saint Paul.
