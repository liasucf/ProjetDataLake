    "text": "\"Abriendo Puertas\" (Opening Doors) is the first single released by Gloria Estefan on her second Spanish album, Abriendo Puertas. ==Song history== \"Abriendo Puertas\" peaked at the top of the charts in Spain, Colombia and the U.S. Hot Latin Tracks. The song was also a number three hit on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The massive hit was the work of Colombian songwriter and producer Kike Santander. Santander combines traditional Colombian vallenato with Gloria's traditional salsa music to give the song a very tropical and joyful rhythm. The song was awarded \"Tropical Song of the Year\" at the 1996 Premio Lo Nuestro awards. A rerecorded version was included in Estefan's 2020 album Brazil305.https://www.allmusic.com/album/brazil305-mw0003406173/credits ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Region !
