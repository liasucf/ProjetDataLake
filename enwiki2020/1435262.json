Exeter breakbeat promoter Biff Mitchell also played an important role in the event's development. The annual festival took place for the first time over four days in the summer of 2004, attracting 22,500 people by 2007. The festival's home for the first five years was the Wasing Estate, in Berkshire.Newbury Today \u2013 Glade festival kicks off today In 2009 it was held in Winchester, and in 2011 and 2012 its location was at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The festival was cancelled in 2013, it did not reappear as was planned in 2014, however the Glade Stage at the main Glastonbury festival continues. Glade Festival originated from the Glade arena started at Glastonbury kicking off in its verdant surroundings with a huge line up of electronic artists including Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Hallucinogen and Hybrid. ==History== ===2004 to 2006=== The first UK festival to feature Psychedelic Trance and Breakbeat as main stages, and with headliners Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Hallucinogen and Stanton Warriors, Glade sold out in its first year attracting over 6500 people. In 2005, the licence was extended to 9500 tickets, which sold out in 8 hours, making it the fastest selling festival in the UK that year. Glade was also the first UK festival to host a stage dedicated to dubstep and was responsible for bringing many now successful dance acts and DJs into the public eye. By 2006, the event had sold out 14,500 tickets without even releasing the artists line up - a phenomenon unheard of outside of Glastonbury Festival. The third Glade is widely regarded as the best UK electronic music festival of its era. === 2007 === In 2007, the event was held at the Wasing Estate for the fourth consecutive year, 20\u201322 July. The licence application suffered an early setback when it was dismissed on a technicality.Newbury Today \u2013 Time called on Glade 2007 GladTalk \u2013 Glade 2007 licence hearing Nuskoolbreaks \u2013 Glade Official Statement The licence application then suffered further setbacksGlade Official Site \u2013 License Hearing resulting in a delay in tickets going on sale, until on 18 April 2007 the mailing list announced \"The Glade Festival is on for 2007... 100% licensed by those wonderful people in power!\" The festival had formerly featured nine main dance tents and stages: Main \"Glade\" Dance Tent (major artists), Breaksday (UK breakbeat), idSpiral (chillout and non-musical acts), Liquid Connective (psy-trance), Origin (psy-trance), Sancho Panza (house), Pussy Parlure (soul, salsa, R&B;, reggae and world), Overkill (formerly the LittleBig tent, featuring breakcore, gabber techno and mash-up) and the Rabbit Hole (secret club, party tent, jam tent by Arabian Tent Company). However, the main dance tent was scrapped for the 2007 event and replaced by a new open air stage for predominantly live acts and two smaller tents comprising a techno tent (Vapor) and the Roots Tent, which is themed on the origins of dance music.GladTalk \u2013 Glade exclusive! Bye bye main dance tent GladTalk \u2013 And now for some good news re Glade There was also a new space called the Nectar Temple, comprising visionary and performance arts from a Californian arts collective.Festival Weather \u2013 exclusive Glade Festival 2007 information The festival was hit by severe flooding that threatened to close the festival; local roads and villages were flooded and closed. The Overkill tent was initially cancelled on the first day of the festival due to the stage being submerged under 2 ft of water. However, organiser Ned Beckett described in some detail how the crew dug trenches and built dams to salvage the stage: \"Little diggers turned up, water pumps were suddenly sucking all the water out of our dance floor, and the sound crew rebuilt their PA on the stage.\"GladTalk \u2013 N>E>D on the flooded Overkill tent It was a herculean effort by the crew to keep the event going and in spite of the weather the event went well. === 2008 === The 2008 event, held during 18\u201320 July, underwent some consolidation in the light of \"festival fatigue\" in the UK festivals market as a whole, caused by a combination of poor weather in the previous year, cheaper festivals in continental Europe and too many UK festivals chasing fewer customers during a period of economic downturn.The Guardian \u2013 Are you suffering from festival fatigue? This consolidation took the form of a reduction in capacity from 18,000 to 12,000 and the loss of some of the additional venues that were added to the 2007 event \u2013 namely the Roots Stage, the Algorithm arts space and the Nectar arts/talks space. Some of the art has been moved to others spaces, such as the inSpiral (formerly ID Spiral) chill-out space. However, the organisers stressed that no advertised performers were cut from any line-ups, nor were there any plans to do so.Glade capacity slashed to 12,000 Despite this, Glade went on to win 'Best Dance Music Festival' at the 2008 UK Festival awards. === 2009 === This year's festival took place from 16\u201319 July 2009.
