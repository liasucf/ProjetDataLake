He succeeded his father, Shlomo Halberstam (1907\u20132000), as Grand Rebbe of Bobov. ==Early life== Naftali Tzvi Halberstam was born in Bobowa, Poland in 1931 (25 Sivan, 5691) to Shlomo Halberstam, the third Bobover Rebbe. His mother and two siblings were murdered in the Holocaust, and after the war, Naftali's father Shlomo had arranged for him to go to Mandatory Palestine. Shlomo remained in Europe, and Naftali was unsure if his father had survived the war. ==Post-war== Halberstam lived for several years in Israel, where he received his rabbinical ordination. After the war, he discovered that his father had indeed survived and relocated to New York. In the late 1940s, he moved there, where he was reunited with his father. On his father's death in 2000, he became the Grand Rebbe of Bobov in Borough Park, Brooklyn. He died on March 23, 2005 (12 Adar, 5765). Halberstam was buried next to his father in Floral Park Cemetery, New Jersey. Halberstam's wife, Rebbetzin Hesa, died on May 15, 2011 (11 Iyar, 5771) aged 80. Halberstam left no sons, only two daughters. His older daughter is married to Yehoshua Rubin, the current Bobov-45 dayan (judge). His younger daughter is married to the first Bobov-45 Rebbe, Mordechai Dovid Unger. ==Rebbes of Bobov== # Shlomo Halberstam (1847\u20131905) grandson of the Sanzer Rebbe, Chaim Halberstam # Ben Zion Halberstam (1874\u20131941) # Shlomo Halberstam (1907\u20132000) # Naftali Halberstam (1931\u20132005) # Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam (b.1955), current Rebbe, younger son of Shlomo Halberstam :* Mordechai Dovid Unger (b. 1954), current and first Bobov-45 Rebbe, son-in-law of Naftali Halberstam ==See also== * Satmar succession feud * Klausenburg (Hasidic dynasty) * Ropshitz (Hasidic dynasty) * Sanz (Hasidic dynasty) ==References== ==External links== * Wedding video with Grand Rabbi Naftali Halberstam - Part 1, Part 2 * Several Thousand Attend Grand Rabbi's Funeral in Brooklyn March 24, 2005 Category:Rebbes of Bobov Category:American Hasidic rabbis Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe Category:Hasidic rabbis in Israel Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe) Category:1931 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Holocaust survivors Category:People from Borough Park, Brooklyn Category:Descendants of the Baal Shem Tov Category:Rabbis that survived the Holocaust ",
