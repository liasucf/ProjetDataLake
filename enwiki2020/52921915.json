    "text": "Henrietta Buckler Seiberling (March 18, 1888 \u2013 December 5, 1979) was a member of a Christian Fellowship group named the Oxford group. She and others of the Oxford group helped found Alcoholics Anonymous. == Early life == Born in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky to Judge Julius A. Buckler and Mary Maddox, Seiberling spent her childhood in Texas. She remained in Texas until she went to Vassar College to receive her A.B. degree with a major in music and a minor in psychology, as she was a gifted pianist. While serving as a lieutenant in the Ohio National Guard, she met her husband Fredrick Seiberling. They married in 1917 in Akron, Ohio, and had three children. == Career == Though Seiberling herself was not an alcoholic, she believed as a Christian that it was her responsibility to solve social problems. Seiberling began the \u201calcoholic squad\" of the Oxford Group Movement. In their first case, Dr. Bob Smith admitted that he was a secret drinker, marking the first time the Akron Oxford Group prayed together to help someone through alcoholism. Although the majority of the Seiberling family were members at a Lutheran church near their house, she was not. Seiberling was more of a \"student of the bible,\" rather than a \"church-goer.\" The Oxford Group came along when Henrietta's marriage to Fredrick Seiberling was crumbling. Her daughter Dorthy said that \"It gave her a new focus, and helped her see that there was more to life than marital problems.\" Henrietta grew closer to Bob and Ann Smith, and would call Ann everyday to talk about the comfort they both received through the Oxford Group. The Oxford Group's beliefs inspired some of the early practices of Alcoholics Anonymous as founded by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith along with others. Henrietta Seiberling and her husband were devoted supporters of Alcoholics Anonymous, opening their home to it members and also leading meetings of the Oxford Group for those who were interested to attend. == Personal life == Her son, John F. Seiberling, was a Representative in the United States Congress from Ohio and a member of the Democratic party. Seiberling also had 2 daughters, Mary S. Huhn and Dorothy Seiberling Steinberg, who was a deputy editor for the New York Times Magazine. == Death and legacy == Seiberling died in New York City on December 5, 1979. On her gravestone is an inscription familiar to both the Oxford Group people and to the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous: \"Let Go and Let God.\" ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Lawrenceburg, Kentucky Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Alcoholics Anonymous Category:Ohio National Guard personnel Category:Seiberling family ",
