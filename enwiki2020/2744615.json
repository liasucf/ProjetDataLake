    "text": "The Girna River is a river in the state of Maharashtra in western India. It gets its name from the goddess Giraja, also known as Parvati. The Girna originates at Kem Peak in the Western Ghats mountain range and flows east across Nashik District\u2014where it is joined by the Mausam River\u2014and into Malegaon. It then swings north to join the Tapti River. The biggest dams on it are Chankapur Dam (built by the British near Abhona in the Kalwan tehsil, where the Sarpganga River joins the Girna) and Girna Dam (built in 1969). The river basin lies on the Deccan Plateau, and its valley has fertile soil that is intensively farmed. ==About river== The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency described the course of the river as follows:http://mpcb.gov.in/ereports/pdf/GirnaRiverReport_.pdf Girna river report ==See also== *List of rivers of India *Rivers of India ==External links== * Girna River at (NIH), Roorkee ==References== Category:Rivers of Maharashtra Category:Tributaries of the Tapti River ",
