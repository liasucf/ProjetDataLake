These Senators had terms starting on 1 July 1947 and due to finish on 30 June 1953. *42 of its members (7 for each state) were elected at the 10 December 1949 election, which was the first election conducted with a single transferable vote under a proportional voting system. The Senators were divided into two classes: **30 of its members (5 for each state) had terms starting on 1 July 1950 and due to finish on 30 June 1956.
