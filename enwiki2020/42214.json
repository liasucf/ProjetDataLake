    "text": "Estrid (Old Norse: \u00c6stri\u00f0r, \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r) was a rich and powerful 11th-century Swedish woman whose long family saga has been recorded on five or six runestones in Uppland, Sweden. This Estrid was the maternal grandmother of the chieftain Jarlabanke of the Jarlabanke clan. The family were rich landowners and belonged to the higher echelons of Swedish society, and she was probably named after Estrid of the Obotrites, who was the queen of Sweden, and the consort of Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung, at the time Estrid was born. Her family saga has been the centre of a dramatisation at the Stockholm County Museum. It is safe to assume that fiveThe runestones U 101, U 136, U 137, U 143 and U 310. of the 11 runestones that mention an Estrid in eastern Svealand refer to this Estrid because of the locations of the runestones and the people who are mentioned on them. A sixth runestone, U 329,U 329: Inga had these stones raised in memory of Ragnfastr, her husbandman. He was Gyr\u00ed\u00f0r's and \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r's brother. Translation provided by Rundata. deals with an Estrid who is only mentioned as the sister of a Ragnfast and a Gyrid. This Ragnfast appears on the Hillersj\u00f6 stone and the Snottsta and Vreta stones as the husband of Inga and the son-in- law of Gerl\u00f6g. Since Fot, the runemaster of U 329, also made runestones for the Jarlabanke clan, and Gerl\u00f6g and Inga also belonged to the same regional elite, it is probable that U 329 refers to the same Estrid as the five other runestones. This would mean that Estrid was born in Snottsta (also spelled Sn\u00e5ttsta) as the daughter of the rich landowner Sigfast. The Broby bro RunestonesThe runestones U 135, U 136 and U 137. tell that Estrid and her husband \u00d6sten had a son by the name Gag, who died while \u00d6sten still was alive,U 137: Eysteinn and \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r raised the stones in memory of Kagr(?)/Gagr(?), their son. Translation provided by Rundata. and three other sons named Ingefast, \u00d6sten and Sven.U 135: Ingifastr and Eysteinn and Sveinn had these stones raised in memory of Eysteinn, their father, and made this bridge and this mound. Translation provided by Rundata. The runestones further tell that a barrow and a bridge were built and that two of the runestones were raised by the brothers Ingefast, \u00d6sten and Sven in memory of their father \u00d6sten, who had gone to Jerusalem and died in the Byzantine Empire.U 136: \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r had these stones raised in memory of Eysteinn, her husbandman, who went to Jerusalem and met his end up in Greece. The story of her life is continued on the Hargs bro runic inscriptions,The runestones U 309 and U 310. where we learn that Estrid had married a man named Ingvar, and this Ingvar had a son prior to marrying Estrid whose name was Ragnvald.U 310: \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r had the bridge made in memory of Ingvarr, her husbandman, and in memory of Ragnvaldr, his son. Translation provided by Rundata.U 309: Sigvi\u00f0r and Ingvarr and Jarlabanki had the runes carved in memory of Ingvarr, their father, and in memory of Ragnvaldr, their brother. Translation provided by Rundata. It also appears that Estrid and Ingvar had three sons named Sigvid, Ingvar and Jarlabanke. We further learn that Estrid had a bridge constructed, which apparently was a tradition in her family. The location of the barrow and what was probably Estrid's grave was in the centre of the picture, just across the road. She appears to have become quite old and moved back to T\u00e4by where she had family, because the last chapter of her life is documented on two runestones in south-western T\u00e4by.The runestones U 101 and U 143. They tell that Estrid cleared a road and built bridges together with her grandson Jarlabanke (by her son Ingefast) and his family, and she dedicated the constructions to her sons IngvarU 143: J\u00f3runnr had the bridges made in memory of her husbandman; and Hemingr and Jarlabanki in memory of Ingifastr; \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r in memory of Ingvarr, an excellent valiant man. Translation provided by Rundata.U 101: Hemingr and Jarlabanki, they had the path cleared and the bridges made in memory of their father; and \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r in memory of her sons Ingifastr and Ingvarr. May God help their spirits. Translation provided by Rundata. (her son with Ingvarr at Harg) and Ingefast (her son with \u00d6sten at Broby bro). When Stockholm County Museum made an archaeological excavation at Broby bro, in 1995, they found three graves. The three were buried in Christian manner, i.e. with the head towards the west, they were not burned and there were few gifts. Some coins that were found helped to date the graves to the 11th century. One of the graves was located just beside \u00d6sten's barrow and it was for a rich and very old woman. The buried woman was probably Estrid. ==Notes== ==Sources and external links== *Rundata * Inga och Estrid \u2014 en s\u00e5pa f\u00f6r tusen \u00e5r sedan: M\u00e4nniskor, h\u00e4ndelser och platser i Ingas och Estrids liv, M\u00e4nniskor, h\u00e4ndelser och platser i Ingas och Estrids liv, Stockholm County Museum. * Gerl\u00f6gs ber\u00e4ttelse \u2014 fakta och fiktion, Stockholm County Museum. * Inga & Estrid \u2014 en s\u00e5pa f\u00f6r tusen \u00e5r sedan, Stockholm County Museum. * Inga & Estrid \u2014 en s\u00e5pa f\u00f6r tusen \u00e5r sedan: Kan detta vara Estrid?, Stockholm County Museum. ==Bibliography== *Andersson, Lars. \"Jarlabankes farmor Estrid: Fick hon sin sista vila vid Broby bro?\" Popul\u00e4r arkeologi 17.2 (1999), 19\u201322. *Hagerman, Maja, and Claes Gabrielsson (photos).
