    "text": "Howard Oliver Drinkwater Read is a British comedian, animator and aspiring song writer best known for his work with his animated sidekick, Little Howard. His other creations include an angry manager with a conversational style and the worldview of Bernard Manning, Roger T Pigeon, and H:BOT 2000, a robot from the future. Each of these characters interact with both Big Howard and each other. Howard Read is also known for his on-stage human Guess Who? act: the audience guesses who he has drawn on a large pad of paper, sitting down as their questions exclude those of a certain appearance until only one person is left standing. In 1993, Howard Read invented NikNakNoodles - an amalgamation of Golden Wonder's Pot Noodle and Golden Wonder's other oddly-flavoured product, Nik Naks. Unfortunately the product was never mass-produced. Read is a regular contributor to Robin Ince's Book Club. Read also went on to work as a current writer for a Disney XD series Counterfeit Cat and is also a current writer for the new Danger Mouse series on CBBC. == Little Howard == Little Howard is a sketched cartoon child aged 6 who is a \"standing-up comedian\". He appears on a laptop or projection screen except on his own TV show, interacting either with Big Howard, the audience, or with other animated characters (including the pigeon Roger, his manager, and H:BOT 2000 (named as MOTHER on Little Howard's Big Question), a computer). He is adept at interrupting Big Howard, dealing with hecklers and doing tarot readings with a pack of Top Trumps. His favourite food is fish and chips and he is currently learning the ukulele. ==Edinburgh Festival Fringe== The Big Howard and Little Howard Show was nominated for a Perrier Award at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2005, Read staged his own Comeback Special where he performed his first solo Festival show. ==TV credits== * 2004 \"Celebdaq\" (BBC Choice/BBC3) * 2005 \"The World Stands Up\" (Paramount Comedy/BBC America) * 2005-06 Two Posh Old Men (UKTV G2) * 2006 \"Stairlift To Heaven\" (CBBC/BBC1) * 2007 Comedy Cuts (ITV2) * 2007 The Royal Variety Performance (ITV1) * 2009-12 Little Howard's Big Question (BBC1/CBBC/BBC2) ==Theatre credits== * 2002 Words and Pictures * 2003 The Big Howard and Little Howard Show * 2004 At Home With The Howards * 2005 The Little Howard Appeal * 2005 2005 Comeback Special * 2007 Little Howard And The Magic Pencil Of Life And Death * 2011 Aladdin * 2012 Little Howard's Big Show * 2013 Howard Read - Hide and Speak == Radio credits == * 2005 The Milk Run (Radio 1) * 2007 An A-Z Of The British Countryside (BBC 7) * 2007 Peacefully In Their Sleeps (Radio 4) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Little Howard's Big Question page Category:British stand-up comedians Category:British animators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century British comedians Category:21st-century British comedians ",
