    "text": "Fawn Krieger (American: b. 8 May 1975) is an interdisciplinary artist who creates discrete sculptures and immersive multi-media environments individually and sometimes in collaboration with other artists and performers, including Neal Medlyn., Tracy + the Plastics, and Anna Oxygen. Often working with a mix of industrial and domestic materials, video and performance, Krieger\u2019s work deals with actions around touch, memory, rupture, and transference as grounds for recovery and re-imagination. Sourcing histories and systems of communal values within material culture, Krieger\u2019s work functions as speculative object-theatres and artifacts, recording corporeal and tactile impressions of social impact, exchange, and revolution. Krieger\u2019s work has been commissioned and installed at numerous venues, including The Kitchen, Art in General, Nice & Fit Gallery, The Moore Space, Von Lintel Gallery, Galerie West, Soloway Gallery, Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Human Resources Los Angeles, Fleisher-Ollman Gallery, and Lambretto ArtProject Krieger was born in Port Jefferson, NY, and currently lives in New York City. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Parsons School of Design, and a Master of Fine Arts from Bard College\u2019s Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts.
