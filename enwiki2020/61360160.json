    "text": "An Officer and a Spy () is a 2019 French-Italian historical drama film directed by Roman Polanski about the Dreyfus affair, with a screenplay by Polanski and Robert Harris based on Harris's 2013 novel of the same name. It had its premiere at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on 30 August 2019, winning the Grand Jury Prize. It received 12 nominations for the 45th C\u00e9sar Awards, the most nominations of any eligible film, and eventually won the awards for Best Adaptation, Best Costume Design, and Best Director. The film was also nominated in four categories at the 32nd European Film Awards, including for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenwriter, ultimately winning none. It received David di Donatello and Polish Film Awards nominations as Best Foreign and Best European film respectively. ==Plot== The film centres on the notorious 19th century Dreyfus affair. Jean Dujardin stars as French officer Georges Picquart. After being appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau, service de renseignement militaire) in 1895, he discovers that doctored evidence was used to convict Alfred Dreyfus, one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff, of passing military secrets to the German Empire. Picquart risks his career and his life, struggling for a decade to expose the truth and liberate the wrongly convicted Dreyfus from the dreaded Devil's Island prison. ==Cast== *Jean Dujardin as Colonel Georges Picquart *Louis Garrel as Captain Alfred Dreyfus *Emmanuelle Seigner as Pauline Monnier *Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois as Hubert-Joseph Henry *Herv\u00e9 Pierre as Charles-Arthur Gonse *Wladimir Yordanoff as Auguste Mercier *Didier Sandre as Raoul Le Mouton de Boisdeffre *Melvil Poupaud as Fernand Labori *\u00c9ric Ruf as Jean Sandherr *Mathieu Amalric as Alphonse Bertillon *Laurent Stocker as Georges-Gabriel de Pellieux *Vincent Perez as Louis Leblois *Michel Vuillermoz as Armand du Paty de Clam *Vincent Grass as Jean-Baptiste Billot *Laurent Natrella as Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy *Bruno Raffaelli as Juge Delegorgue *Pierre Poirot as officier Vallecalle *St\u00e9fan Godin as General Darr *Luca Barbareschi as Philippe Monnier *Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina as Bachir *Luce Mouchel as Madame Sandherr *Fabien Tucci as S\u00fbret\u00e9 agent *Franck Mercadal as Capitaine Calmont *Philippe Magnan as Attorney Brisset *Pierre Forest as Colonel Maurel *Jeanne Rosa as Martha Leblois *Beno\u00eet Allemane as Georges Charpentier *Ludovic Paris as Arthur Ranc *G\u00e9rard Chaillou as Georges Cl\u00e9menceau *Nicolas Bridet as Mathieu Dreyfus *Andr\u00e9 Marcon as \u00c9mile Zola *Jean-Marie Frin as President of the Jury *Swan Starosta as Lucie Dreyfus *Thierry Gimenez as Colonel Jouaust ==Production== Robert Harris was inspired to write the novel by his friend Polanski's longtime interest in the Dreyfus affair. Harris followed up the novel with a script of the same story, titled D, with Polanski announced as director in 2012. This film marks the third time Harris has worked with Polanski. Harris previously co-wrote The Ghost Writer with Polanski, which was also an adaptation of one of Harris's novels, The Ghost. The two first worked together in 2007 on a film adaptation of Harris's novel Pompeii,Variety 1 February 2007: Polanski propels 'Pompeii'. Retrieved 30 January 2012 which was cancelled just before filming due to a looming actors' strike.Rotten Tomatoes 12 September 2007: Roman Polanski Flees Pompeii. Retrieved 30 January 2012 Although set in Paris, An Officer and a Spy was first scheduled to shoot in Warsaw in 2014, for economic reasons. Production was postponed after Polanski moved to Poland for filming and the U.S. Government filed extradition papers. The Polish government eventually rejected them, by which time new French film tax credits had been introduced, allowing the film to shoot on location in Paris. The film was budgeted at \u20ac60m and was next set to start production in July 2016, but its production was postponed again while Polanski waited on the availability of a star, whose name was not announced. Filming began on 26 November 2018 and was completed on 28 April 2019. The film was produced by Alain Goldman's L\u00e9gende Films and distributed by Gaumont. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on 30 August 2019. At the Venice Film Festival, the film won the Grand Jury Prize. It was released in France on 13 November 2019, and in Italy on 21 November 2019. ==Reception== An Officer and a Spy holds 77% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.8/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 56 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The film received a standing ovation during its premiere in Venice, and has overall received positive reviews from critics. David Sexton from the Evening Standard gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, declaring that: \"It's an absolute masterclass in how to make a historical film\". The film has received backlash due to parallels Polanski allegedly made between his sexual abuse case and the film's plot. ==Controversy== Polanski's attendance at the Venice Film Festival was his first appearance at a major film event since he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in May 2018. During the festival, the head of the jury Lucrecia Martel stated: \"I don't separate the man from the art. I think that important aspects of the work emerges in the man. [...] A man who commits a crime of this size who is then condemned, and the victim considers herself satisfied with the compensation is difficult for me to judge... It is difficult to define what is the right approach we have to take with people who have committed certain acts and were judged for them. I think these questions are part of the debate in our times.\" Martel also stated she would not attend a gala dinner in support of the film. Polanski's producers threatened to pull the film from the festival lineup. Martel later clarified her comments, stating: \"According to some reports after today's press conference, I believe my words were deeply misunderstood. Since I don't separate the work from the author and I have recognized a lot of humanity in Polanski's previous films, I am not opposed to the presence of the film in competition. I don't have any prejudice towards it and of course I will watch the film like any other in the competition. If I had any prejudice, I would have resigned my duty as the president of the jury.\" Alberto Barbera, the festival director of Venice, had previously defended the film being in the lineup, stating: \"We are here to see works of art, not to judge the person behind it. I hope we can just discuss about the quality of the film and not about Polanski and the case with L.A. County.\" U.S. distribution companies rejected invitations to a buyers' presentation during the Cannes Film Festival. Howard Cohen of Roadside Attractions stated: \"I think we would consider it, though I'm not even sure how I personally feel. People have been releasing his films for years. Now, we are looking at it through a different lens, with good reason. We have to search our souls if it's the right thing to do. What does it mean to release this movie? I don't think that's a settled question even in my mind.\" In November 2019, five days before the official release of An Officer and a Spy in France, Polanski faced accusations of rape by a French woman, Valentine Monnier. Upon the release, French feminist groups invaded or blockaded several cinemas, having the film cancelled in some places. When the film was nominated for 12 C\u00e9sar Awards in January 2020, women's groups said that the French film academy was acclaiming \"an abuser and rapist on the run\". Eventually, Polanski as well as other crew members of An Officer and a Spy did not attend the 45th C\u00e9sar Awards ceremony. No one was there to accept the awards on Polanski's behalf. The C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director to Polanski was poorly received by the audience. Few clapped, and several people walked out in disgust, including Best Actress nominee Ad\u00e8le Haenel.C\u00e9sars : Roman Polanski d\u00e9sign\u00e9 meilleur r\u00e9alisateur, Les Mis\u00e9rables meilleur filmPortrait of A Lady On Fire Star Ad\u00e8le Haenel Storms Out of Awards Show After Roman Polanski Wins ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:French films Category:Italian films Category:French drama films Category:Italian drama films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Roman Polanski Category:Films about the Dreyfus affair Category:Films whose director won the Best Director C\u00e9sar Award Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Venice Grand Special Jury Prize winners ",
