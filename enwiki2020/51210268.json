It is famous for the Suttur Mutt which is one of most prominent spiritual centers of India. =Suttur is a village situated on the banks of the River Kapila in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru district. It is located at a distance of 28 km south of Mysuru (connected by State Highway via Varuna village) and around 170 km from Bengaluru. The shrine of Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivrathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji is the main temple at Suttur. Thousands of devotees visit the shrine throughout the year. ==History== Community life in India is closely linked with spiritual and religious institutions for the past five thousand years. The Rishis have been the beacons and guiding forces in upholding the moral values of life and in the progression of society as a whole. The glorious Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Math, popularly known as Sri Suttur Math is a reflection of and testimony to this rich tradition. Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math with a long history of more than one thousand years is a multi-dimensional institution that has contributed immensely to the cause of societal advancement. The welfare activities of the Math transcend the public of all the sections of Indian society. The founding of the Math can be traced to a historical event linked with Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji crusading for peace between two warring kingdoms. The hostility between Rachamalla IV of the Gangas of Talkad and Rajendra of Cholas was about to break up into a large scale war. It was due to the timely intervention of Sri Shivarathreeshwara Swamigalu, the hostility ended and the enemies became friends. Then it was at the request of Rajendra, Mahaswamiji graciously condescended to establish a Math on the banks of the River Kapila at Suttur near Mysuru. The inscriptional pieces of evidence support the establishment of Suttur Math during the reign of Chola kingdom. The name Shivarathri is mentioned in many ancient works. The Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji tradition handed down from one pontiff to another indicates that the said Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji is the founder of the Jagadguru Sri Veersimhasana Math. Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar, the second pontiff, was responsible for further development of the Suttur Math during the times of Rajendra Chola. The Someshwara temple near the Math at Suttur is said to have been constructed by the Chola kings, in accordance with the wishes of Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar. An inscription referring to this event is dated October 23, 1032. ==Culture== === Suttur mutt === Suttur Mutt has a history of 1,000 years. Suttur Mutt established Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara Mahavidyapeetha (popularly called as JSS Mahavidyapeetha) in 1954. Suttur Mutt runs more than 300 educational institutions in Karnataka and other parts of the country. Some of the institutions are located in North India and outside the country. The present Pontiff Jagadguru Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji is the President of Mahavidyapeetha. Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math can most aptly be described as an active ongoing movement to uphold the cause of social and economic justice, based on spiritual values and ideals. The Math's activities at Suttur have spread far and wide beyond the small region on the banks of the River Kapila in Karnataka to touch the lives of millions going beyond the boundaries of our country, and even to the distant shores of the other countries. A quick look at the lineage of the Math brings to light the unwavering societal concern of the Pontiffs. If the founding of the Math was incidental to establishing harmony and peace between the two warring factions of the region by its founder, Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji, the Pontiffs who followed saw purpose in promoting academics, literature, healthcare, infrastructure, etc. The Math philosophy has found expression in the teachings and words of countless saints and seers as well as writers and philosophers. The worship of Shiva means 'tolerance and love to all living beings' and 'regarding work as a means of worship'. The lineage of Suttur Math The Suttur Math region grew up over the centuries with the contribution of each one of its illustrious pontiffs. Each pontiff chose his route to further the advancement of society. The high stature that the Sri Suttur Math enjoys today is thus the cumulative result of their initiatives, efforts and actions. 1.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji 2.Jagadguru Sri Eeshaneshwara Wodeyar Mahaswamiji 3.Jagadguru Sri Nijalinga Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 4.Jagadguru Sri Siddananja Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 5.Jagadguru Sri Kapininanjunda Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 6.Jagadguru Sri Channaveera Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 7.Jagadguru Sri Siddhamalla Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 8.Jagadguru Sri Parvathendra Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 9.Jagadguru Sri Bhandari Basappa Wodeyar Mahaswamiji 10.Jagadguru Sri Koogaluru Nanjunda Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 11.Jagadguru Sri Ghanalingadeva Mahaswamiji 12.Jagadguru Sri Immadi Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji 13.Jagadguru Sri Channabasava Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 14.Jagadguru Sri Gurunanja Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 15.Jagadguru Sri Guruchannabasa Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 16.Jagadguru Sri Gurupanchakshara Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 17.Jagadguru Sri Chidghana Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 18.Jagadguru Sri Channaveera Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 19.Jagadguru Sri Mahanta Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 20.Jagadguru Sri Siddhamalla Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 21.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Dehshikendra Mahaswamiji 22.Jagadguru Sri Mantramaharshi Pattada Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji 23.Jagadguru Dr Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji 24.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji - Present Pontiff ==Education== * J.S.S.Higher Primary School was established in 1991.
