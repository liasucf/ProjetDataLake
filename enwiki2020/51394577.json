    "text": "\"Still Breathing\" is a song by American rock band Green Day. It was released on November 12, 2016, as the second single from their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio (2016). It is considered to be an emotionally dark song that explores the theme of individuals finding strength in the face of hardship and tough times. The song's music videoreleased on November 7, 2016reflected upon that theme. \"Still Breathing\" received positive critical reception and was praised for its sentimental concept and spirited musical composition. It peaked at number one on the US Alternative Songs, Mainstream Rock, Rock Airplay, and Canada Rock charts, and appeared on various other international charts. ==Background and composition== In 2014following the band's 99 Revolutions Tour, in support of \u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! (2012)Billie Joe Armstrong started testing and recording material at his new studio, Otis, in Oakland, California. The first song that Armstrong wrote was \"Bang Bang\", the first single released from their 2016 album Revolution Radio. That song reminded critics of Green Day's earlier work. Following that, \"Still Breathing\" was released as the second single from the album and was also compared to the band's earlier works. The new song was described as dark and unsettling, with a theme of staying strong in the face of adversity and overcoming it. The song explores the lives of individuals addicted to drugs and gambling, fatherless children, single mothers, and soldiers returning from war, with their stories intertwined throughout the song. Considered to be more emotional than the lead single, \"Still Breathing\" is characterized as a \"serious\" track. Armstrong intended to make others happy, and to make a difference, by getting people to recognize themselves in the song. He described the track as \"a very heavy song\", and further explained, \"Sometimes I run away from being too heavy. But sometimes it just comes out that way.\" While commenting on the chorus, I'm still breathing on my own, he added, \"at some point, we're all going to have to be on life support. As time goes on, your thoughts get darker.\" ==Release== Armstrong is one of the many characters featured in the video. Following the release of \"Bang Bang\" on August 11, 2016, a lyric video for \"Still Breathing\" was uploaded to YouTube on September 22, 2016. It was released as the second single from Revolution Radio on November 12, 2016, and a promotional CD was made available only in the UK on February 10, 2017. ==Reception== \"Still Breathing\" was received positively by music critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin O'Donnell praised the song by saying that it \"isn\u2019t just one of their most rousing songs, it\u2019s also one of their best.\" Gil Kaufman of Billboard stated the band is \"back in classic form\" with emotional twists and deep lyrical content that symbolize some of band's \"most beloved work\". NME called it \"an air-punching punk glory full of strength, power and guts\" that \"lauds the resilience of the human spirit and the ability to make it through tough times\". The A.V. Club described \"Still Breathing\" as a \"statement of purpose for the record\" and that it was a recognition of everyone's struggle. Loudwire's Graham Hartmann noted it as the \"poppiest cut from the album yet, while also being the most emotionally heavy\", opining that the band had shifted to a more \"radio- friendly\" version of their \"revolution\" while keeping their same aesthetic. PopMatters wrote that the song \"is overly familiar\" and that it had \"quiet verses and a loud chorus\", but admired the melody and chord progression of the song. ==Chart performance== \"Still Breathing\" peaked at number one on the US Alternative Songs, Mainstream Rock, and Rock Airplay charts.
