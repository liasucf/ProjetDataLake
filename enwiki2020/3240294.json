The inn was torn down in 1997.SUNDAY NEWS, LANCASTER, PA,Pg. D-1, July 13, 1997 In the early 18th century, John Wallace built a small building in Earl Town at the intersection of two Indian trails, French Creek Path (Route 23) and Paxtang (Route 322). He hung a blue ball out front from a post and called it \"The Sign of the Blue Ball\". Locals soon began calling the town \"Blue Ball\" after the inn. In 1833, Earl Town officially changed its name to Blue Ball. During Prohibition, the inn changed its name to Blue Ball Hotel. ==Trivia== The town's name is suggestive, reminding some of the slang term \"blue balls\" (1916), also known as \"hot nuts,\" which refers to the sexual condition of temporary testicular and prostate fluid congestion due to prolonged and unsatisfied sexual excitement.
