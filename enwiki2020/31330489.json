It is currently owned and operated by Sime Darby Berhad. ==History== Established in 1917 shortly after the nearby Tennamaram Estate, Elmina Estate is the second-oldest oil palm plantation in Malaysia. The Selangor Oil Palm Company Ltd. of Edinburgh, Scotland purchased the 3,407-acre estate in 1923 and opened a new oil palm factory there in 1927. Beginning in the 1930s, it was a site for oil palm breeding experiments that contributed significantly to the selection of modern planting material. Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad owned the estate as of 2006, just prior to their 2007 merger with Sime Darby. Inside the estate is also the crash site of a Japanese Airlines (JAL) that was arriving into Subang Airport. ==References== Category:Selangor Category:Palm oil companies of Malaysia Category:Agriculture companies established in 1917 ",
