Originally named the Indianapolis Capitals, the team started the 1963-64 season playing out of the Pepsi Coliseum in Indianapolis, but only 9 games into the season a gas explosion during an ice show destroyed the Indianapolis Coliseum. The Capitols parent club, the Detroit Red Wings, terminated their lease on the rink and moved the franchise to Cincinnati, Ohio to become the Cincinnati Wings. The Wings relocated to Memphis, Tennessee for the 1964-65 season to become the Memphis Wings. In 1963-64 the combined Indianapolis/Cincinnati team had a record of 12-53-7-31 and finished in 5th (last) place in the CPHL. ==Indianapolis Capitols/Cincinnati Wings roster== *Tony Leswick (Head Coach) *Alex Faulkner *Barrie Ross *Bert Marshall *Bill Mitchell *Bob Champoux (goalie) *Bob Cox *Bob Wall *Bryan Campbell *Dennis Kassian *Dennis Rathwell *Don Chiz *Doug Messier *Earl Heiskala *Frank Hincks *Hank Bassen (goalie) *Harrison Gray (goalie) *Howie Menard *Irv Spencer *Jack Faulkner *Jack McIntyre *Jim Peters *Jim Watson *Joe Daley (goalie) *Ken Laufman *Max Mestinsek *Nick Libett *Norm Beaudin *Pete Shearer *Ray Ross *Richard \"Chick\" Balon *Roger Lafreniere *Ron Harris *Ron Leopold *Sid Finney *Stuart \"Butch\" Paul *Wayne Muloin ==References== ==External links== *Team profile at Hockeydb.com *SCSR / Cincinnati Wings Category:Sports teams in Cincinnati Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Ohio Category:Central Professional Hockey League teams Category:1963 establishments in Ohio Category:1964 disestablishments in Ohio Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1963 Category:Ice hockey clubs disestablished in 1964 ",
