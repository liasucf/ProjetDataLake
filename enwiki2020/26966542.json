    "text": "136-138 Collins Street is an architecturally distinguished Second Empire house in Hartford. Built about 1870, it is a rare and well-preserved example of this style in the city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 29, 1982. ==Description and history== 136-138 Collins Street is located in Hartford's Asylum Hill neighborhood, on the north side of Collins Street east of Summer Street. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a slate mansard roof. It is set on an elevated basement, giving it a taller than typical appearance. It is three bays wide, with its entrance in the center bay, and a two-story projecting pavilion to its right. The roof line is pierced by dormers in the mansard section that have elaborately carved surrounds and round-arch windows, that in the projecting section larger than the others. The latter dormer has a bellcast shape with a peaked hood. The roof the eaves have paired brackets. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with peaked lintels and bracketed sills. The house was built about 1870. It probably had a more ornate front porch; the present one is a 20th-century replacement. The house was once owned by Isaac Frisbie, the superintendent of Hartford's poor house, which was located behind the house. ==See also== *Building at 142 Collins Street *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Second Empire architecture in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:Houses in Hartford, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut ",
