Running for as a two- lane highway, the road was originally placed under state jurisdiction in 1935 (as SR-30), but renumbered to its current designation in 1966. ==Route description== State Route 117 begins on 200 North at the intersection of 200 West in Wales, travelling east for two blocks before turning south on State Street. After less than , it leaves the southern end of Wales, the road turns again to the east for approximately , passing through the town of Chester and crossing US-89 before entering Spring City along 300 North. In Spring City, the route turns north on Main Street, turning to the northeast after about , continuing this direction for about before terminating at US-89 in Mount Pleasant, directly opposite the Mount Pleasant Airport. ==History== This route was originally part of former State Route 30, a somewhat longer route which was designated as running from Fountain Green on former SR-11 (also known as U.S. Route 89A), south through Freedom and Wales, then east through Chester and Spring City, then northeast to former SR-32 (US-89) in Mount Pleasant. In 1966, the counties in northern Utah requested that the State Road Commission designate a single route number to run east\u2013west across that part of the state. Since Nevada's portion of the highway was numbered SR 30, Utah selected that number. As a result, in November 1966 the former State Route 30 was renumbered as State Route 117. Route 117 had been freed up four months prior in July when former SR-117 from Bicknell to Boulder was absorbed by former SR-54 (now part of SR-12). In 1969, the legislature shortened the route by , moving the western terminus from Fountain Green to Wales. After this change, the route has remained the same through the present day. ==Major intersections== ==References== 117 117 ",
