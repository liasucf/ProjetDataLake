    "text": "So You Think You're Funny? (SYTYF) is an annual stand-up comedy competition for new acts. The competition began in 1988 in the United Kingdom. The finals are held every August at The Gilded Balloon during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Past winners include Dylan Moran, Lee Mack, Peter Kay and David O'Doherty. == History == Bill Bailey in 2008 So You Think You\u2019re Funny was the idea of Karen Koren, Artistic Director of The Gilded Balloon, in order to discover new comic talent. During the years it has developed into the most influential competition of its kind in the UK, helping start the careers of many of the country\u2019s leading comedians including Dylan Moran, Lee Mack, Graham Norton, David O\u2019Doherty and Tommy Tiernan. Other competitors have included Ardal O'Hanlon, Johnny Vegas, Ed Byrne, Jason Byrne, Alex Zane, Reginald D Hunter, Craig Hill, Alan Carr, Rhod Gilbert, Andrew Lawrence and Russell Howard. Sponsorship from Channel 4 began in 1993 and ran until 2004, since when Channel 5 and The Paramount Comedy Channel have been sponsors. Now sponsored by Foster\u2019s, the first prize is \u00a35000 and a place in the Best of British Show at the Montreal \"Just For Laughs\" Festival. Past judges have included Steve Coogan, Owen O\u2019Neill, Avid Merrion (Leigh Francis), Bob Mortimer and former So You Think You're Funny winners Dylan Moran and Rhona Cameron. Comperes for the evening have included Eddie Izzard, Bill Bailey, Graham Norton and Jo Brand. The competition spun a teenagers version entitled \"Class Clowns\", derived from an Australian format of the same name, which was staged at the Gilded Balloon for the first time in 2015. Judged by Jo Brand, Kevin Day and Karen Koren, the first Fringe winner was Joe Gardner. == Rules and eligibility == The rules and eligibility are as follows: \"1. The performer cannot have performed stand up REGULARLY either paid or unpaid before 1st June of the year prior to the competition. * 2\\. The performer should not have appeared in So You Think You're Funny? before. 3\\. The performer\u2019s material must be completely original. 4\\. The performer must have at least 8 minutes of original material. 5\\. The organisers reserve the right to select all entrants and decisions taken by the organisers and judges are final. 6\\. All entrants must be aged 18 and over. * This means you can have performed, either paid or unpaid before June 2013, but not regularly. So a handful of gigs well spaced out, once or twice, every couple of months is fine, but performing two times a week is too many. The exception to this is those who have performed as part of a recognised comedy course in this period.\" == Process of elimination == The competition starts in the spring of each year with showcases in Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham, York, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, Inverness, Dublin, Brighton and Nottingham as well as ten comedy clubs in London. In 2013, there were over 500 applicants for only 55 places in the Edinburgh heats. Each showcase is not a direct competition, with judges instead selecting the best acts they have seen over the entire run to take part in one of seven heats at the Gilded Balloon at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Winners of each of these heats go forward to the final. ==Winners and finalists== ===2019=== Results: * Finlay Christie (Winner) * Shane Daniel Byrne (runner up) * Charlie George (second runner up) * Claire Haus * Denis Len * Erika Ehler * Fady Kassab * Kate Bancroft * Kate McGann MC Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Jenny Eclair ===2018=== Results: *Danny Garnell (Winner) *Liam Farrelly (runner up) *Bec Melrose (shared third) *Joe Hobbs (shared third) **Martin Durchov **Natalie Loh **Chelsea Birkby **Patrick Healy **Shane Clifford MC Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Rhod Gilbert ===2017=== Results: *Maisie Adam (winner) *Sarah Mann (runner up) *Morgan Rees (third) **Robin Allender **Kirsten Brown **Jamie D'Souza **Archie Henderson **Esther Manito **Eric Rushton **Amira Saied MC: Aisling Bea Comedy Guest Judge: David O'Doherty ===2016=== Results: *Heidi Regan (Winner) *Ruth Hunter (runner up) *Danielle Walker (third) **Harriet Braine **Kelly Convey **Sophie Henderson **Jamie M **Stuart McPherson **Arielle Souma MC Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Alan Davies ===2015=== Results: *Luca Cupani (Winner) *Yuriko Kotani (runner up) *Ed Night (as Ed Day) (third) **Ben Pope **Yumna Mohamed **Neil O'Rourke **Matilda Wnek **Red Richardson **Stephen Lawson **AJ Roberts MC: Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Mark Watson ===2014=== Results: *Aidan Strangeman (Winner) *Elliot Steel (2nd Place) *Joe Hart (3rd Place) **Mark Daniels **Jim Smith **Benji Waterstones **Christopher MacArthur-Boyd **Eshaan Akbar **Gary Meikle MC: Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Jason ManfordComedy.co.uk Sponsor: Foster's ===2013=== Results: *Edward Hedges (Joint Winner) *Demi Lardner (Joint Winner) *Laura Mclenaghan (2nd Place) **Andrew McBurney **Nicky Wilkinson **Tom Taylor **Alasdair Beckett King **Russ Peers **Jenny Collier MC: Zoe Lyons Comedy Guest Judge: Sarah MillicanBBC Sponsor: Foster's ===2012=== Results:\"Finalists & Runners up\", So You Think You're Funny?.
