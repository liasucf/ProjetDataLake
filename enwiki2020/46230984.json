    "text": "Justin Donawa (born 27 June 1996) is a Bermudian footballer who plays as a forward for Darlington in the sixth tier of English football, the National League North, and for the Bermuda national football team. He previously appeared for Somerset Trojans and Black Rock FC. Donawa was a cricket player and triple jumper while growing up in Bermuda, winning three medals in regional competitions and competing at the 2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics. He found success, however, in football, coming to the United States to attend the Berkshire School and then Dartmouth College. Donawa won three Ivy League championships with the Big Green, appeared during school breaks with Somerset Trojans, and spent time in the collegiate offseason with Black Rock FC. He was drafted by Columbus Crew SC in the third round of the 2019 MLS SuperDraft, but was not signed by the club. Donawa represented Bermuda at U20 level before breaking into the senior national team in 2015. He scored his first two goals for his country on his second cap, coming against the Bahamas in a 2018 World Cup qualifier. ==Early life== Born in Sandys Parish, Bermuda, Donawa grew up playing three sports: he ran track and field and played football and cricket during his youth. Donawa took part in the Bermuda Football Association's prep school tour in 2010, earning himself a spot at the Berkshire School in Sheffield, Massachusetts. Competing alongside Jack Harrison and countryman Zeiko Lewis, Donawa was part of a Berkshire team that won NEPSAC Class A state titles in 2012, 2013, and 2014. He was selected to take part in the 2014 High School All-America Game, alongside Harrison and fellow NEPSAC players Francis Atuahene and Edward Opoku. At club level, Donawa appeared for Black Rock FC during his time at the Berkshire School. He committed to play college soccer for coach Chad Riley and the Dartmouth Big Green. ==College and amateur== Donawa debuted for Dartmouth on 3 October 2015, coming off the bench in the Big Green's Ivy League opener against Princeton. He played 48 minutes of a 1\u20130 Dartmouth victory. Donawa scored his first collegiate goal on 24 October, tallying the game-winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Columbia, and scored his first NCAA tournament goal on 22 November as Dartmouth were eliminated in the second round by Syracuse. Although he appeared in just 10 games, Donawa tallied two goals and three assists and was named Honorable Mention All-Ivy. As a sophomore, Donawa won a regular spot in the Dartmouth lineup, putting up stats of three goals and four assists in 17 appearances. All three of his goals were game-winners: against Seattle on 11 September 2016, New Hampshire on 5 October, and Columbia on 22 October. Dartmouth won their third consecutive Ivy League crown and again advanced to the NCAA tournament, but were eliminated in the second round by Syracuse for the second consecutive season; Donawa was again named Honorable Mention All- Ivy. As a junior, Donawa tallied three goals and a career and team-high eight assists in 17 appearances. He scored against UMass Lowell on 20 September 2017, the only goal of a 1\u20130 Dartmouth victory, added a goal and an assist in a 2\u20131 win over Princeton on 30 September, and scored in a 3\u20130 win over Hofstra on 3 October, all part of a three-goal, one-assist performance in a four-game span. He was an integral part of a Dartmouth team that claimed their fourth consecutive Ivy League championship, but did not take a kick in the penalty shootout as the Big Green were eliminated from the NCAA tournament by New Hampshire. Donawa was named First Team All-Ivy following the season. As a senior, Donawa missed much of the year due to injury, tallying two goals and an assist in just six appearances. He scored game-winning goals in back-to- back overtime victories, against Massachusetts on 22 September 2018 and Albany on 25 September, but would play his final collegiate game on 2 October against Vermont and miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He finished his collegiate career with ten goals from 50 appearances. ===Somerset Trojans=== Donawa came through the youth setup at Somerset Trojans, playing in the Player Development League and the U-14 KO Cup. He made his senior debut for Somerset on 2 January 2014, appearing off the bench in the Friendship Trophy final as the Trojans claimed a 3\u20132 victory against Hamilton Parish. He continued to appear for Somerset for four more seasons, albeit infrequently as he could only play for the club while on breaks from school. Donawa returned to Somerset during the 2014\u201315 season, playing against Robin Hood in the Friendship Trophy and helping the club to claim their first Bermudian Premier Division title in 22 years. He was unable to appear in the title-deciding victory over Southampton Rangers, however, after suffering a sprained ankle while on international duty. Donawa helped the club to another championship in 2015\u201316, appearing in the Friendship Trophy while on holiday from school. He scored the final goal of a 3\u20130 victory against Hamilton Parish in the semifinals, giving Somerset the chance to win their eleventh Friendship Trophy after the new year. Against PHC Zebras in the final, Donawa scored the winning goal just before halftime as the Trojans claimed a 2\u20131 victory. On 12 December 2016, Donawa scored his first career Bermudian Premier League goal. His eighth-minute strike, off an assist from Hubert Buttersfield, helped Somerset claim a 2\u20132 draw against Devonshire Cougars. His second league goal had to wait until the 2017\u201318 season, coming in a 3\u20131 victory over X-Roads Warriors on 11 December 2017. He also added a goal in the semi-finals of the Expansion League Festive Tournament later that month and played the full 90 minutes in a 3\u20133 draw with North Village Rams on 17 March that clinched Premier Division safety for Somerset. The match against North Village would mark Donawa's final game with the club, as he was unable to participate during the 2018\u201319 season due to injury and a lack of international clearance. ===Black Rock FC=== Following his junior season at Dartmouth, Donawa was on the roster of Premier Development League expansion club Black Rock FC. He did not make an appearance as Black Rock qualified for the Eastern Conference semifinals. ==Club career== ===2019 trials=== Donawa was not selected to take part in the 2019 MLS Combine after struggling through an injury-ridden senior season at Dartmouth. He went on trial at Scottish Premiership club Aberdeen during December, and although he \"definitely got good feedback\" was not signed by the club. On 14 January 2019, Columbus Crew SC drafted Donawa with the 66th overall pick in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft. He joined the club for preseason as an unsigned draft pick, but was released midway through camp without earning a contract. Following his release, Donawa went on an unsuccessful trial with USL Championship club Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC. He continued his search for a club following the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, moving to England and going on trial with National League North side Darlington. Donawa impressed manager Alun Armstrong during his trial, tallying a goal in a friendly against Northallerton Town while being described as \"a game-changer\" and \"as good as gold\". ===Darlington=== After impressing during his trial with Darlington, Donawa was offered a deal for the 2019\u201320 season. He joined fellow Bermudian international Osagi Bascome with the Quakers. Donawa made his debut for Darlington FC on August 3, 2019 in their 1-3 loss away at Farsley Celtic. ==International career== Donawa first broke into the Bermudian international setup at the under-20 level, appearing during 2015 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualifying. He received his first senior call-up for a training camp ahead of the first round of 2018 World Cup qualification and received his first cap in a friendly against Grenada on 6 March 2015. He played 58 minutes of a 2\u20132 draw before being substituted for Jalen Harvey. Donawa made his competitive debut for the Gombey Warriors on 25 March 2015, starting and scoring his first two international goals in a 5\u20130 World Cup qualifying victory against the Bahamas. His 57th- and 70th-minute goals were the fourth and fifth strikes of the night for Bermuda. Donawa continued to be called up during his time at Dartmouth, earning eight caps over his four years with the Big Green. ==Life outside of football== ===Personal life=== Donawa is the nephew of Roger Trott, who played five List A cricket matches for Bermuda in the 1990s. Donawa's father, Jay, was a distance runner who competed at Auburn in the 1990s; his grandfather, Delwyn Trott, played for the inaugural Devonshire Colts side in the 1950s; and his younger brother Mateo played alongside him for Somerset Trojans. As a youth, Donawa played cricket for the Somerset Cricket Club, competing as a fast bowler. He was called into a training squad for the Bermuda national team in May 2016, but was forced to give up the sport while going to school in the United States. ===Track and field career=== Donawa began competing in track and field at the age of 14, winning a bronze medal in the boys' under-17 triple jump at the 2011 CARIFTA Games. He returned at the 2012 CARIFTA Games, winning a gold medal in the event with a jump of 14.63 metres. Donawa qualified for the 2012 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics, finishing second in the Male Junior B category. He also competed in the 2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics, placing seventh in the triple jump with a personal best of 15.65 metres. At Dartmouth, Donawa continued to compete in the triple jump while also beginning to compete in the long jump. He placed second in the triple jump at the 2016 Ivy League Indoor Championship with a jump of 15.57 metres, his collegiate-best mark. In 2017, Donawa took 17th place at the NCAA East Regional during the outdoor season. In his final collegiate meet, the 2018 Ivy League Indoor Championships, Donawa won the Ivy League title with another 15.57 metre jump, making him the first Dartmouth athlete to win a team and individual Ivy League championship in two different sports since Adam Nelson in 1997. {| |- !colspan=6|Representing |- |2011 |CARIFTA Games |Montego Bay, Jamaica |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |Triple jump |13.47 m (wind: \u20131.0 m/s) |- |rowspan=3|2012 |rowspan=2|CARIFTA Games |rowspan=2|Hamilton, Bermuda |bgcolor=gold|1st |Triple jump |14.63 m (wind: +1.6 m/s) |- |4th |Long jump |6.42 m (wind: \u20130.5 m/s) |- |Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships |San Salvador, El Salvador |bgcolor=silver|2nd |Triple jump |14.49 m (wind: \u20130.3 m/s) |- |rowspan=2|2013 |CARIFTA Games |Nassau, Bahamas |5th |Triple jump |14.92 m (wind: \u20131.7 m/s) |- |World Youth Championships |Donetsk, Ukraine |7th |Triple jump |15.65 m (wind: +1.1 m/s) |- |2014 |CARIFTA Games |Fort-de-France, Martinique |4th |Triple jump |15.22 m (wind: +2.2 m/s) |} ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Somerset Trojans |2013\u201314 |Bermudian Premier Division |0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||1||0||1||0 |- |2014\u201315 |Bermudian Premier Division |1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||1||0||2||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Bermudian Premier Division |0||0||0||0||0||0||2||2||2||2 |- |2016\u201317 |Bermudian Premier Division |1||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||1||0||2||1 |- |2017\u201318 |Bermudian Premier Division |2||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||1||0||3||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !4!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!6All appearances in the Friendship Trophy!!2!!10!!4 |- |Black Rock FC |2018 |PDL |0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Darlington |2019\u201320For FA Cup qualifying rounds: For FA Trophy third qualifying round: |National League North |29||6 |4||2||colspan=2|\u2013||4||1||37||9 |- |2020\u201321For FA Cup 2nd qualifying round: |National League North |2||0||2||2||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||4||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total |31||6||6||4||colspan=2|\u2013||4||1||41||11 |- !colspan=3|Career total !35!!8!!6!!4!!0!!0!!10!!3!!51!!15 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !colspan=3|Bermuda |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2015||5||2 |- |2016||2||0 |- |2017||2||0 |- |2018||2||0 |- |2019||9||1 |- !Total!!20!!3 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Bermuda's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- |+International goals |- !scope=col|No. !scope=col data-sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Venue !scope=col|Opponent !scope=col|Score !scope=col|Result !scope=col|Competition |- !scope=row|1 |rowspan=2|25 March 2015||rowspan=2|Thomas Robinson Stadium, Nassau, The Bahamas||rowspan=2|||align=center|4\u20130||rowspan=2 align=center|5\u20130||rowspan=2|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |- !scope=row|2 |align=center|5\u20130 |- !scope=row|3 |24 March 2019||Estadio Cibao, Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic||||align=center|3\u20131||align=center|3\u20131||2019\u201320 CONCACAF Nations League qualification |} ==Honours== ===Football=== Dartmouth * Ivy League: 2015, 2016, 2017 * Honorable Mention All-Ivy: 2015, 2016 * First Team All-Ivy: 2017 Somerset Trojans * Bermudian Premier Division: 2014\u201315 * Friendship Trophy: 2015\u201316 Black Rock FC * Northeast Division: 2018 ===Track and field=== ;Dartmouth * All-Ivy League (triple jump \u2013 indoors): 2016, 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Dartmouth profile * Somerset profile * Justin Donawa at USL League Two * * * Category:Living people Category:1996 births Category:Bermudian footballers Category:Male triple jumpers Category:Male long jumpers Category:Bermudian cricketers Category:People from Sandys Parish Category:Association football forwards Category:Dartmouth Big Green men's soccer players Category:Dartmouth Big Green men's track and field athletes Category:Columbus Crew SC draft picks Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Bermuda international footballers Category:2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup players Category:Bermudian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Bermudian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Bermudian expatriate sportspeople in England ",
