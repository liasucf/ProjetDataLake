    "text": "Strangers in the Wind is a 1978 rock album by the Bay City Rollers. It was the group's sixth original studio album, and second consecutive disc to feature the production work of Harry Maslin, who produced hits for Air Supply. Early 1978 had seen a reunion of the Rollers' most successful line-up as bassist Alan Longmuir, a founding member, re-joined the band after a two-year hiatus, now on rhythm guitar. The group timed the release of their new album to coincide with their very own network television series, The Krofft Superstar Hour Starring the Bay City Rollers, a Saturday morning NBC show. Unfortunately, the kiddie format did little to push record sales for the Rollers, who were over two years removed from their phenomenon stage. The lush, mature soft-rock of Strangers in the Wind did not find an audience, and each of three singles failed to hit the U.S. charts. The most successful single from the album, \"Where Will I Be Now,\" was a minor hit in Germany.https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Bay+City+Rollers&titel;=Where+Will+I+Be+Now&cat;=s The band regrouped again with another new line-up and a name change for 1979's Elevator.
