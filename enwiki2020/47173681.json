His mother, Jessie Rae was of Samoan, Rotuman and Scottish descent whereas his father, Dan Costello, was Irish; both were born in Fiji. He was brought up in Tavua. His father owned a cattle ranch.

While in New Zealand, Costello took much interest in rugby, soccer, and athletics, and represented North Auckland in the \"Under 17\" soccer team. He completed his last year of school in Suva, Fiji, at Marist Brothers High School, where he won the school's talent contest for that year.

After winning a few talent contests, he joined a small group called The Beachcomber Boys who performed daily at the Beachcomber Island Resort. ==Music== In 1979 he recorded his first solo-album called \"Tropical Sunset\" which wasn't much of a success but a year later, his album, Lania which was a huge success in Fiji and around the Pacific.
