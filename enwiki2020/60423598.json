O'Connell Bridge House was completed in 1964 and opened in 1965. It was built by John J. Byrne (1920\u20132013) at a cost of 1 million Irish pounds. On 26 November 1972, loyalists planted a bomb outside the rear exit door of the Film Centre Cinema, at O'Connell Bridge House, injuring 40 people. The Department of the Environment left the building in 1999. ==Architecture== A 12-storey concrete and glass tower faced in Portland stone designed by Desmond FitzGerald. On its north face is a clock and a large advertising space; it has in the past bore the names of Guinness and Sony, and now holds Heineken. ===Reception=== Kevin Duff, writing in The Irish Times declares that, \"the design of this 12-storey building is the epitome of its time, when new commercial schemes generally showed no regard for site or context. However, because of its scale and location, O'Connell Bridge House makes probably the single most brutal intrusion into Dublin's urban design - more serious, even, than Liberty Hall.\" ==Gallery== File:O'Connell Street Bridge House.jpg File:20130807 dublin092.JPG File:Dublin Heineken Building.jpg File:Heineken soviet star Dublin night.jpg File:O'Connell Bridge House, or the Heineken Building - geograph.org.uk - 1578573.jpg File:OConnell bridge (260961146).jpg File:Heineken building - panoramio.jpg ==References== Category:Office buildings in the Republic of Ireland Category:Office buildings completed in 1965 Category:Buildings and structures in Dublin (city) Category:1965 establishments in Ireland ",
