    "text": "Jacques Dixmier (born 1924) is a French mathematician. He worked on operator algebras, especially C*-algebras, and wrote several of the standard reference books on them, and introduced the Dixmier trace and the Dixmier mapping. ==Biography== Dixmier received his Ph.D. in 1949 from the University of Paris, and his students include Alain Connes. In 1949 upon the initiative of Jean- Pierre Serre and Pierre Samuel, Dixmier became a member of Bourbaki, in which he made essential contributions to the Bourbaki volume on Lie algebras. After retiring as professor emeritus from the University of Paris VI, he spent five years at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques. Often, there is made the erroneous claim that Dixmier originated the name von Neumann algebra for the operator algebras introduced by John von Neumann, but Dixmier said in an interview that the name originated from a proposal by Jean Dieudonn\u00e9. Dixmier was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1966 at Moscow with talk Espace dual d'une alg\u00e8bre, ou d'un groupe localement compact and again in 1978 at Helsinki with talk Alg\u00e8bres enveloppantes. == Publications == * J.
