Pedro Fernandez de Castro was Lord (Se\u00f1or) of Lemos and Sarria and served as mayordomo mayor (lord steward) of Alfonso XI of Castile, adelantado de la frontera (governor) of Andalusia, Galicia and Murcia and pertiguero mayor (a title similar to the French Vidame) of the lands of Santiago. He was the father of Fernando Ruiz de Castro (toda la lealtad de Espa\u00f1a), Queen Juana de Castro (wife of Peter of Castile), the controversial In\u00eas de Castro (consort King Peter I of Portugal) and \u00c1lvaro Pires de Castro. ==Family Origins== Pedro Fernandez de Castro (el de la Guerra) was the son of Fernando Rodr\u00edguez de Castro and his wife Violante S\u00e1nchez of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV, King of Castile and Leon. He was the paternal grandson of Esteban Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and his wife, Aldonza Rodr\u00edguez de Le\u00f3n, granddaughter of Alfonso IX of Leon. On his mother's side, he was a grandson of Sancho IV of Castile, King of Castile and Le\u00f3n, and his mistress Mar\u00eda Alfonso T\u00e9llez de Meneses. ==Biography== His father, Fernando Rodr\u00edguez de Castro, was killed in battle in 1304, while fighting against Infante Philip of Castile, son of Sancho IV of Castile. On the death of his father, Pedro was sent by his mother to the Kingdom of Portugal, where he was raised and educated along with Infante D. Pedro, Count of Barcelos, an illegitimate son of King Denis of Portugal. Around the year 1319, Pedro Fernandez de Castro returned to Galicia and Alfonso XI of Castile gave him his ancestral manor of Lemos and Sarria and appointed him Lord Steward of the realm. In 1330, Pedro accompanied King Alfonso on his campaign into Granada and led the Christian attack at the Battle of Teba In 1334, Afonso IV of Portugal invaded the kingdom of Castile and Le\u00f3n, entering through the lands of Galicia. However, Pedro Fernandez de Castro refused to fight against him, due to the favors he received in the past at the court of Portugal. Alfonso XI gave him the County of Trast\u00e1mara, which the sovereign had intended to give his son Henry. Due to his military skills, Alfonso XI sent Pedro Fernandez to fight Muslims in Andalusia, where he fought at the Battle of Salado in 1340, where tradition refers to Pedro Fernandez de Castro grabbed his spurs of gold from the Marinid sultan of Morocco, Abu Al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman. He participated in the siege of Algeciras in 1342, which he led his retinue in the company of Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Gres, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. Pedro Fernandez de Castro died in 1342, being a victim of an epidemic during the siege of Algeciras. ==Marriage and offspring== His first wife was, Beatrice of Portugal, Lady of Lemos, youngest daughter of Afonso of Portugal, Lord of Portalegre and Violante Manuel, granddaughter of King Ferdinand III of Castile and Le\u00f3n. There were no children from this marriage. His second wife was, Isabel Ponce de Leon, daughter of Pedro Ponce de Leon, Lord of Cangas and Tineo, and his wife, Sancha Gil de Braganza. Their children were: * Fernando Ruiz de Castro toda la lealtad de Espa\u00f1a (\"all the loyalty of Spain\")(1377), Count of Lemos, Sarria and Trastamara, standard-bearer and steward of King Peter of Castile. * Juana de Castro (died 1374), first married Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, Lord of Ordu\u00f1a and Valmaseda, son of Fernando D\u00edaz de Haro and Maria of Portugal and, after her husband's death, married King Peter of Castile in 1354.
