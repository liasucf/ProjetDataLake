Because of the boycott of the United States and other countries, only one team was available to compete in the Women's Field Hockey Tournament: the hosting USSR team. A late request was sent to the government of the African nation, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games. ==References== * Category:Zimbabwean female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Zimbabwe Category:Field hockey players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Arusha Region Category:Tanganyika (territory) people Category:White Zimbabwean sportspeople Category:Afrikaner people Category:Zimbabwean people of Dutch descent Category:Olympic gold medalists for Zimbabwe Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics ",
