    "text": "\"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)\" is a song written and originally recorded by Hank Williams on MGM Records. It hit number two on the Billboard country singles chart in 1951. In his autobiography, George Jones printed the first six lines of the song and stated, \"Its lyrics couldn't be more simple - or profound.\" ==Recording and composition== According to Colin Escott's 2004 book Hank Williams: The Biography, fiddler Jerry Rivers always claimed that Hank wrote the song in the touring Sedan, and when he came up with the opening line, \"Today I passed you on the street,\" and then asked for suggestions, steel guitarist Don Helms replied, \"And I smelled your rotten feet.\" The song was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 16, 1951 and issued as MGM catalog No. 10961. Williams was backed on the session by members of his Drifting Cowboys band, including Rivers, Helms, Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton or \"Cedric Rainwater\", aka Howard Watts (bass), and either Owen Bradley or producer Fred Rose on piano. It was released as the B-side of \"Howlin' at the Moon\" but on the strength of its simple language and passionate singing, soared to number two on the Billboard country singles chart.(Hank Williams discography#singles) Williams sang the song with Anita Carter on the Kate Smith Evening Hour on April 23, 1952. The rare television appearance is one of the few film clips of Williams in performance. ==Notable cover versions== Many artists have covered the song.
