    "text": "Send More Paramedics were an English horror film-influenced crossover thrash band from Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. They are named after a line in the film Return of the Living Dead. ==Biography== The name is a reference to a line in the 1985 horror/comedy Return of the Living Dead. The band originally formed as a side project of Leeds emo band And None of Them Knew They were Robots, but have gained a higher profile than And None of Them Knew They Were Robots, who have since split up. The band played in the 1980s crossover style, what they described as \"Zombiecore...a fusion of 80s thrash and modern hardcore punk\", with lyrics about zombies and cannibalism, and were heavily influenced by zombie movies. On stage, they dressed as zombies and the drummer donned a Mexican wrestling mask (a homage to the character in Brian Clement's Meat Market films with whom he also shares the name El Diablo). As part of this on-stage persona, band members claimed to be members of the living dead. The band performed at the 2005 Download Festival, the 2006 Reading and Leeds Festivals, were one of the first acts confirmed for 2006's Damnation Festival and were the opening act for Avenged Sevenfold at the Camden Underworld. They also toured as support to The Offspring. Their live show was described by Drowned in Sound as \"brilliantly ghoulish\" and \"mouth-agape entertainment of the highest quality\".Hocking, Matt (2004) \"Gigs/Review/Avenged Sevenfold, AKO and Send More Paramedics\", Drowned in Sound, 27 February 2004, retrieved 15 September 2009Diver, Mike (2005) \"Gigs/Review/Send More Paramedics\", Drowned in Sound, 15 August 2005, retrieved 15 September 2009 Disc 2 of their 2006 album, The Awakening, is a concept disc, a zombie movie soundtrack, similar to the soundtrack in George A.

Below is a table outlining these references. (incomplete) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Song ! Reference |- | The Hordes | The chorus, \"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth,\" is the Dawn of the Dead tagline. |- | The Pain of Being Dead | The name of this song references a line in the movie Return of the Living Dead, in which the character \"Ernie Kaltenbrunner\" asks a rotting zombie woman who has been torn in 2 and tied down to an embalming table about why they eat people, the zombie states \"not people, brains\", they eat brains. Ernie asks why they eat brains and the half zombie says \"the pain\". Ernie asks \"what about the pain\" and she answers \"the pain of being dead\". |- | The Night Has a Thousand Eyes | This is a cover of the theme music to The Return of the Living Dead. |- | Zombie vs Shark | This is a reference to the movie Zombie Flesh Eaters by Lucio Fulci, in which a female scuba diver witnesses an altercation between a shark and a member of the undead. |- | Burning the Body | This is a reference to Zombie Flesh Eaters 2, in which the corpses of the deceased return to the world of the living as a result of burning one of the infected cadavers. The lyric \"zombies stumble through the traffic\" refers to the final scene of Zombie Flesh Eaters in New York City, where the undead plague a bridge, and due to budget restrictions, the film makers couldn't afford to have the traffic stopped. Also, a sample from the movie can be heard at the start of the track. |- | Follow Your Programming | This is a reference to the movie Zombie Flesh Eaters 2, in which the military blocks off the zombie infestation using force. |- | Resurrection Cemetery | This song is a reference to Return of the Living Dead, about a specific scene in the film where a gang of 'punks' go to congregate in the local cemetery (bearing the name \"Resurrection Cemetery\" on its gates). Later on, zombies begin to crawl out from their graves and hunt down the gang. |- | Brains | Opens with a sample of dialog from Return of the Living Dead Part II (\"They want brains? We'll give 'em brains.\") |} ==References== ==External links== *Official Send More Paramedics website *Send More Paramedics at Leeds Music Scene Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2007 Category:Crossover thrash groups Category:English rock music groups Category:Horror punk groups Category:Hardcore punk groups from Leeds ",
