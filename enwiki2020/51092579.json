It has been studied as a potential long-acting injectable male contraceptive, though it has not been marketed for this indication. Approximately 70% of men became azoospermic, while the remaining men all became oligospermic. NHPP has a mean residence time in the body of 29.1 days and an elimination half-life in the body of 20.1 days. ==See also== * List of androgen esters \u00a7 Nandrolone esters ==References== Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Contraception for males Category:Estranes Category:Nandrolone esters Category:Progestogens Category:Propionates Category:Testosterone ",
