    "text": "Theo Hayez is an 18-year old Belgian backpacker who disappeared in the Cape Byron area. He was last sighted leaving Cheeky Monkey\u2019s bar in Byron Bay at approximately 11:00 pm on the 31 May 2019. == Investigation == Hayez arrived in Australia in late 2018 on a working holiday visa. He disappeared a week before he was due to fly home to Belgium. His family called New South Wales police on 6 June 2019, concerned about his lack of contact and that he had failed to return to his accommodation. The Wake Up! hostel where Hayez was staying also called the police on that same day, three days after Hayez failed to check out. His personal belongings, including his passport, were still in his room. Hayez's parents Laurent Hayez and Vinciane Delforge travelled to Australia to assist in the searches in June 2019, making a plea to the Australian people to help in the searches; \"When I left Belgium I promised Hayez's little brother, Lucas, I would bring his brother home, please help me keep my promise to him\", Laurent said. Australian police conducted searches along with helicopters, drones, dogs, trackers, divers and rock climbers. Messaging platform Whatsapp cooperated with NSW Police in the endeavour to recover chat logs from the night. However, the information Whatsapp could provide was limited due to encryption. In July, a grey Puma hat similar to the one Hayez was wearing when he was last seen was found in bushland at Tallow Beach by community search volunteers. Hayez's final phone signal was determined to be in the proximity of Cape Byron on 1 June 2019. Investigations in conjunction with Hayez's family and Google suggest a last possible whereabouts in the vicinity of Cosy Corner, Tallow Beach. == Podcast == Per Hayez's family's request, The Australian national crime correspondent David Murray joined the searches. Murray spent three months with the unofficial search party and has documented his experience in a podcast called The Lighthouse. ==References== Category:2010s missing person cases ",
