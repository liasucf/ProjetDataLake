    "text": "The Jingzaijiao Tile-paved Salt Fields () are salt ponds in Beimen District, Tainan, Taiwan. ==History== Originally established in 1818 by salt farmers as the Laidong Salt Fields, the field is the oldest salt field in Taiwan. The site was originally a desert. It was then later procured by Taiwan Salt Company. In 1952, the field area was redesigned and the field became the only central-style tiled-paved salt field in Taiwan. Due to the declining business of salt industry, groups had been actively advocating for the revival of the field, thus the field had then been restored for tourism purpose. ==See also== * Agriculture in Taiwan ==References== ==External links== * Category:1818 establishments in Taiwan Category:Farms in Taiwan Category:Landforms of Tainan Category:Salt production Category:Tourist attractions in Tainan ",
