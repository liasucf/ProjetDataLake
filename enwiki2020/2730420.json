They provide most train services at the station, with two trains per day operated by CrossCountry. The general service level is eight trains per hour - two to South Wales, two to , two toward and two toward . Filton Abbey Wood is the third station on the site. The first station, Filton, was opened in 1863 by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. The station had a single platform, with a second added in 1886 to cope with traffic from the Severn Tunnel. The station was closed in 1903, replaced by a new station, Filton Junction, further north, which was built at the junction with the newly constructed Badminton Line from Wootton Bassett Junction. The new station had four platforms, each with waiting rooms and large canopies. Services at Filton Junction declined in the second half of the twentieth century, with the station buildings and Badminton Line platforms demolished in 1976. The station was closed completely in September 1996, replaced by the current station, Filton Abbey Wood. This was built south of the original station, adjacent to a new Ministry of Defence office development. The station was built with two platforms, but a third was added in 2004 and a fourth in 2018. The line through Filton Abbey Wood is not electrified. Platform 4 was completed in 2018 as part of the Filton Bank four-tracking project, allowing increased services between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads. == Description == A view from the footbridge.

The first, Filton, opened in 1863 just north the site of the current Filton Abbey Wood, and was closed in 1903. A second station was opened a few hundred yards to the north, and was known as Filton Junction. This station closed in 1996, replaced by Filton Abbey Wood.\"Filton station closes\" Rail issue 289 9 October 1996 page 6 === First station: Filton === The first station at Filton opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from to , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track broad gauge, with a platform on the western side of the line. The station was situated in the county of Gloucestershire, from Bristol Temple Meads and immediately south of the modern bridge over the A4174 Avon Ring Road. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway, who had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to standard gauge. Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so a tunnel was built under the River Severn. To cope with the anticipated increase in demand, the line through Filton was doubled, with a new platform built on the eastern side of the new track, complete with waiting room. The new track was first used on 1 September 1886 when the Severn Tunnel opened. The station continued in use until 1 July 1903, when it was closed and replaced by a new station further north. There is no trace remaining of the original station. === Second station: Filton Junction === A train for Wales passes through Filton Junction in 1962. A train passes through Filton in 1972, working a Wales-Bristol service. The line off to the left is the Henbury Loop Line. The large station building on the west side in 1977. Filton Junction railway station in 1992, after the demolition of the buildings. The station as it stands today, seen from a passing train. In 1900, almost all trains from London to Wales travelled via Bath and Bristol, with some still routed via . However, the final to Bristol were relatively slow and congested, so a new route was built further north, the GWR's Badminton Line, now part of the South Wales Main Line, running from Wootton Bassett Junction to . The new line opened in 1903, and allowed faster services to Wales. There was a new triangular junction between Patchway and Filton, with the new line coming in from the east. The new station, opened on 1 July 1903, was on an embankment at the southern apex of the junction, just north of the present A4174. It was north of the first station, from Bristol Temple Meads and from London Paddington via the new line. The new station had four platform faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains on the new line. The platforms were linked by a subway which led to the booking office, situated on ground level by the main entrance on the east side of the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west side of the line and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered loading platform and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton Junction Signal Box, which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers. Following the opening of the Henbury Loop Line, which diverged from the line towards Wales to the north, the station was renamed Filton Junction on 1 May 1910. Trains on this line used the western platforms, and often operated loop services to and from Bristol Temple Meads via . From 1928, trains could also run loop services via Clifton Down, and . As well as being useful for passengers changing trains (due to its junction status), Filton Junction was also used by workers at the nearby Filton Aerodrome and the attendant aircraft works. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Filton Junction came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Following the publication of the Beeching Report, the Henbury Line was closed to passengers in 1964, and service levels began to decline. The line between and Severn Beach was also closed, putting an end to loop services. The goods yard was closed in July 1965, and the station's name reverted to Filton from 6 May 1968. Much of the station buildings were demolished in 1976, as were the platforms serving Badminton Line trains, as no trains on this line called at Filton anymore. The remaining two platforms had small replacement shelters built on them. In 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect, the southern part of Gloucestershire, including the district of Filton, became part of the new county of Avon. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Filton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, plans were made to build a new station in Filton and close the 1903 station. The last train called on 8 March 1996, with services moving to the new Filton Abbey Wood from 11 March, with two intervening days of no service due to a closure of the Severn Tunnel. The remains of Filton Junction can still be seen from passing trains, and the two western platforms are still present, albeit overgrown. The subway has been blocked off, and the access road is now a residential street called \"The Sidings\". === Third station: Filton Abbey Wood === Snowy conditions in 2010, showing the three platforms, with the newest platform on the right. Filton Abbey Wood was constructed for ease of access of workers at MoD Abbey Wood, which is next to the station. Platform 4 which was added in 2018 In the early 1990s, the Ministry of Defence procurement division was consolidated into a major office development in Filton, known as MoD Abbey Wood. As part of this development, a new station was built in Filton, primarily to serve the MoD workers. Construction began in 1995, and cost \u00a31,400,000. The station, named Filton Abbey Wood, was opened to the public on 11 March 1996 and officially opened on 19 March by Minister for Transport Steven Norris MP and the Chair of Avon County Council. Shortly after the station was opened, the county of Avon was disbanded, with the Filton region now governed by South Gloucestershire council. The new station was situated south of the first Filton station, and south of Filton Junction. There were two platforms, each long, separated by two running lines. A ramped footbridge connected the platforms at the north end, and each platform had ground-level access from the sides: the eastern, southbound platform from MoD Abbey Wood; the western, northbound platform via a footpath from the car park to the north. There were metal and glass shelters on each platform and a small, rarely used booking office on the southbound platform. Initial services at the station included local stopping services from Bristol to South Wales, and services between and . Services towards Bath were of particular importance to the MoD, as many of their staff had been based there prior to the construction of MoD Abbey Wood. South Gloucestershire council provided a subsidy for half-hourly services to Bath. The station proved popular with MoD workers, local residents commuting into central Bristol, and also students and staff at the University of the West of England. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains in 2001. The line through Filton closed for two weeks in June 2004 to enable the construction of a new platform and third running line on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost \u00a316 million, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach Line services to allow longer-distance services to use it as a diversion. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western which was subsequently rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. First introduced new services between and , and between and , each calling at Filton Abbey Wood. From December 2006, Virgin CrossCountry began operating a single daily service Newcastle to Cardiff Central via Bristol Temple Meads and Filton Abbey Wood. This service was taken over by Arriva CrossCountry when the CrossCountry franchise changed hands in 2007, and then replaced by a daily service each direction between Cardiff Central and . A three-week closure of the line and station in late October & early/mid November 2018 saw all trains replaced by buses between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads and on the Severn Beach branch whilst the four track layout between Dr Day's Junction and Filton Junction was reinstated, also bringing a new fourth platform at Filton Abbey Wood into use and short extensions to the southern ends of the other three platforms to fully accommodate 5 carriage 23 metre vehicle trains. == Future == First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The CrossCountry franchise is also due to expire in 2019. The line through Filton Abbey Wood was due to have been electrified by 2017 as part of the Great Western Main Line electrification project, however this has been postponed indefinitely. The Cross Country Route, the Bristol to Exeter line and the Heart of Wessex Line were not set to be electrified, so services at Filton Abbey Wood would still have been provided by diesel trains; however many \"Sprinter\" units have been replaced by and \"Turbo\" units. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing beyond the main lines, as does MP for Weston-super- Mare John Penrose. The electrification scheme also included the four-tracking of the line through Filton to allow more services between and and to separate fast inter-city services from local stopping services, which was completed in November 2018. A fourth platform has been added in November 2018 as part of the project.\"NR agrees \u00a333m contract for Bristol four-tracking\" Rail issue 761 12 November 2014 page 24\"Preparations continue for Bristol resignalling\" Rail issue 848 14 March 2018 page 29 Filton Abbey Wood is on the / corridor, one of the main axes of the Greater Bristol Metro, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area.
