    "text": "Kuniesaurus albiauris is a species of skink endemic to New Caledonia. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Kuniesaurus. It is only known from a small patch of dense coastal forest with limestone substrate on the Isle of Pines. Due to its very small and restricted habitat, it is highly threatened by invasive species such as the little fire ant. It has been proposed that Kuniesaurus be classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. == References == Category:Monotypic lizard genera Category:Endemic fauna of New Caledonia Category:Skinks Category:Taxa named by Ross Allen Sadlier Category:Taxa named by Matthias Deuss Category:Taxa named by Aaron M.
