    "text": "Portrait of Harry Belafonte, Almanac, 18 February 1954 \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" is a traditional Jamaican folk song. The song has mento influences, but it is commonly classified as an example of the better known calypso music. It is a work song, from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading bananas onto ships. The lyrics describe how daylight has come, their shift is over, and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home. The best-known version was released by American singer Harry Belafonte in 1956 (originally titled \"Banana Boat (Day-O)\") and later became one of his signature songs. That same year The Tarriers released an alternative version that incorporated the chorus of another Jamaican folk song, \"Hill and Gully Rider\". The Tarriers version was recorded by Shirley Bassey in 1957 for her 1959 album The Bewitching Miss Bassey. ==Origins== The song was first recorded by Trinidadian singer Edric Connor and his band \"Edric Connor and the Caribbeans\" on the 1952 album Songs From Jamaica; the song was called \"Day Dah Light\". Belafonte based his version on Connor's 1952 and Louise Bennett's 1954 recordings.The Louise Bennett version of Day O (The Banana Boat Song) is available and documented in both French and English on the Jamaica - Mento 1951-1958 album (2009) In 1955, American singer-songwriters Lord Burgess and William Attaway wrote a version of the lyrics for the Colgate Comedy Hour, in which the song was performed by Harry Belafonte. Belafonte recorded the song for RCA Victor and this is the version that is best known to listeners today, as it reached number five on the Billboard charts in 1957 and later became Belafonte's signature song. Side two of Belafonte's 1956 Calypso album opens with \"Star O\", a song referring to the day shift ending when the first star is seen in the sky. During recording, when asked for its title, Harry spells, \"Day Done Light\". Also in 1956, folk singer Bob Gibson, who had traveled to Jamaica and heard the song, taught his version to the folk band The Tarriers. They recorded a version of that song that incorporated the chorus of \"Hill and Gully Rider\", another Jamaican folk song. This release became their biggest hit, reaching number four on the pop charts, where it outperformed Belafonte's version. The Tarriers' version was recorded by Shirley Bassey in 1957 and it became a hit in the United Kingdom. The Tarriers, or some subset of the three members of the group (Erik Darling, Bob Carey and Alan Arkin, later better known as an actor) are sometimes credited as the writers of the song; their version combined elements of another song and was thus newly created. == Notable covers == * The Fontane Sisters mimicked The Tarriers version in a recording of the song for Dot Records in 1956. It charted to number 13 in the US in 1957. * Beetlejuice The Musical used it as a part of their recording ==Parodies and alternate lyrics== * \"Banana Boat (Day-O)\" a parody by Stan Freberg, released in 1957 by Capitol Records, features ongoing disagreement between an enthusiastic Jamaican lead singer and a bongo-playing beatnik (Peter Leeds) who \"don't dig loud noises\" and has the catchphrase \"You're too loud, man\". When he hears the lyric about the \"deadly black taranch-la\" (actually the highly venomous Brazilian wandering spider, commonly dubbed \"banana spider\"), the beatnik protests, \"No, man! Don't sing about spiders, I mean, oooo! like I don't dig spiders\". Freberg's version was popular and received much radio airplay; Harry Belafonte reportedly disliked the parody. Stan Freberg's version was the basis for the jingle for the TV advert for the UK chocolate bar Trio from the mid-1980s to the early to mid-1990s, the lyrics being, \"Trio, Trio, I want a Trio and I want one now. Not one, not two, but three things in it; chocolatey biscuit and a toffee taste too.\" * Dutch comedian Andr\u00e9 van Duin released his version in 1972 called Het bananenlied: the banana song. This song asks repetitively why bananas are bent. It reaches the conclusion that if the bananas weren't bent they wouldn't fit into their peels. * German band Trio performed a parody where \"Bommerlunder\" (a German schnapps) substituted the words \"daylight come\" in the 1980s. In one rare occurrence, Trio and Harry Belafonte appeared in the same TV show, \"Bio's Bahnhof\", in 1982, with the latter watching Trio's act in disbelief. * The Serbian comedy rock band the Kuguars, consisting of famous Serbian actors, covered the song in 1998, with lyrics in Serbian language dedicated to the, at the time, Yugoslav national soccer team player Dejan \"Dejo\" Savi\u0107evi\u0107. The song became a nationwide hit, and a promotional video for the song had been recorded. * In their 1994 album, the comedy music group Grup Vitamin included a Turkish cover of the song parodying the macho culture in the country. *The Swedish humor show Rally, which aired between 1995 and 2002 in Sveriges Radio P3 made a version called \"Hey Mr. Taliban\", which speaks about Osama Bin Laden with the lyrics \"Hey Mister Tallyman, tally me banana/Daylight come and me wan' go home\" replaced by \"Hey Mister Taliban, In Afghanistan/US Come and you wanna go home\" or \"Hey Mister Taliban! Turn over Bin Laden\" and \"Day-O! Daaaaay-O! Daylight come and me wan' go home\" is replaced by \"Day-O! Daaaay-O! Missile come and you wanna go home\". * Since 1988 British radio DJ and presenter Simon Mayo has used several variations of the song as jingles. This originated during Mayo's time as presenter of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show where the jingle was sung by fellow presenter Steve Wright and has continued on many of his shows since, including Mayo's Drivetime show on BBC Radio 2 and since 2019 an orchestral version on Mayo's mid-morning show on Scala Radio. * In 1988\u201389, Belafonte's children, David and Gina, parodied the song in a commercial about the Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo. (David was singing \"Trofeo\" in the same style as \"Day-O\" in the song). * A parody of this song was used in an E-Trade commercial that first aired on Super Bowl LII *Food manufacturer Kellogg's parodied the song in their 2001 television advertisement for their breakfast cereal Fruit 'n Fibre. * For an ad campaign that started in 1991, now-defunct Seattle-based department store chain Bon Marche used a version of the song with alternate lyrics in their commercials. *In November 2019, the Stephen Colbert show modified the lyrics to make fun of Mike Pompeo, saying \"Pompe-O, Pompe-O. Hearing come and I wanna go home.\" and continuing with \"Clearly we all knew of quid pro quo\", \"We all knew of the Ukraine deal\", \"Soon Mr. Adam man will issue him subpoena\", \"Run Mr. Flabby Man, Run back to Kansas\", with each line followed by \"Hearing come and I wanna go home.\" ==Samples and interpolations== * American rapper Lil Wayne samples the line \"6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch\" for the hook of the song \"6 Foot 7 Foot\", together with the line \"Stack Banana\" which is repeated throughout the song. * Chilean program 31 minutos used the song \"Arwrarwrirwrarwro\" by Bombi which was based on \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\". *Jamaican singer Conkarah samples the chorus in his 2019 song \"Banana\" featuring Shaggy. ==In media and politics== * The original 1956 Belafonte recording is heard in the 1988 film Beetlejuice in a dinner scene in which the guests are supernaturally compelled to dance along to the song by the film's protagonists. ** It was also sung by Beetlejuice and Lydia in the first episode of the animated series. ** The scene from the film is recreated as the first act finale in the Broadway musical adaptation. ** The song appeared in Teen Titans Go! in the crossover episode with Beetlejuice himself \"Ghost With The Most\". In the episode the Titans and Betelgeuse need to get into The Lost Souls Room and to do that they needed to get past two giant guards. Betelgeuse used the same thing that happened in the movie to get the Titans and the guards to start dancing and singing like in the movie only for the guards to get knocked out thanks to the lyrics \"6ft. 7ft. 8ft. PUNCH!\" which caused them to punch themselves out. * In the TV series Legends of Tomorrow season 2 episode 14 \"Moonshot\", a character abruptly starts singing the song to cause a distraction. * During the first leg of the thirty-second season of the American version of The Amazing Race, contestants had to play a section of the song on a steelpan during a Roadblock challenge. ===Justin Trudeau blackface incident=== On September 18, 2019, Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, admitted to singing \"Day-O\" while wearing blackface makeup and an afro wig at a talent show when he was in high school at Coll\u00e8ge Jean- de-Br\u00e9beuf. ==References== ==External links== * English version of the text can be found at the bottom of the page.
