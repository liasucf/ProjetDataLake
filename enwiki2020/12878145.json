    "text": "Jeffrey Laurence Overton (born May 28, 1983) is an American professional golfer. Overton was born in Evansville, Indiana; he graduated from Evansville North High School, leading the Huskies to two State Golf Finals; he finished as State Runner-Up in 1999 (as a sophomore) and then led the Huskies to the State Championship in 2000 as a Junior.http://www.ihsaa.org/Sports/Boys/Golf/TeamStateChampions/tabid/212/Default.aspx#2233912-teams He attended Indiana University, graduating in 2005 with a degree in Sports Marketing and Management. Turning pro in 2005, he is currently a member of the PGA Tour. He graduated from Q-School in his first attempt and started to play on the Tour in 2006. His father was a star quarterback at Evansville Harrison High School and the Indiana State Sycamores.http://golfweek.com/2010/09/27/ryder-rookie-overton-finds-normalcy- home/http://archive.courierpress.com/columnists/gordon-engelhardt/engelhardt- harrisons-legacy-of-excellence-began-with-ron- overton-1fbecf22-db16-2bb4-e053-0100007f26c-327591821.html In 2006, he scored a double eagle (albatross) on the 18th hole at Westchester Country Club during the Barclays Classic as he holed a fairway wood from 239 yards after a 294-yard drive. In 2007 he recorded his best finish, a 2nd place finish at the Wyndham Championship. During the final PGA Tour event of 2008, the Children's Miracle Network Classic, Overton was ten days removed from an appendectomy and was ranked 125th, barely hanging on to a full-season exemption. A 21st-place finish moved him up to 118th and he retained his card for 2009. In 2009 he improved to 2009. The following season, 2010, was his best season. He recorded three runner-up finishes that season: at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, at the HP Byron Nelson Championship, and at the Greenbrier Classic. At the Greenbrier, he held a three-shot lead after 54 holes but could not withstand an amazing 4th round by Stuart Appleby, who shot a round of 59 to win his 9th PGA Tour event. Following this tournament Overton reached the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings for the first time. He also recorded two 3rd place finishes and an 11th place finish at the 2010 Open Championship. He ended 2010 in 12th place on the PGA Tour money list. His strong 2010 season earned him a place on the United States Ryder Cup team; he and teammate Rickie Fowler became the first-ever Americans to make the team without a victory on the PGA Tour. In 2015, Overton barely retained his PGA Tour card, finishing 125th in the FedEx Cup. ==Amateur wins (10)== *2003 Indiana Amateur *2004 Indiana Amateur *2001\u201305 seven collegiate events *2005 Big Ten Conference Champion ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2008 !2009 !2010 !2011 !2012 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T44 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T63 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |T70 |T13 |T11 |T38 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T32 |71 |CUT |CUT |} CUT = Missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied ==Results in The Players Championship== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016 |- |align=left|The Players Championship |CUT |T37 |T26 |T26 |CUT |T26 |82 |CUT |CUT |} CUT = missed the halfway cut \"T\" indicates a tie for a place ==Results in World Golf Championships== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Tournament!!2010!!2011 |- |align=\"left\"|Match Play |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |R64 |- |align=\"left\"|Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |66 |- |align=\"left\"|Invitational |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T6 |T68 |- |align=\"left\"|Champions |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} QF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play \"T\" = Tied ==U.S. national team appearances== Amateur *Palmer Cup: 2005 (winners) *Walker Cup: 2005 (winners) Professional *Ryder Cup: 2010 ==See also== *2005 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:American male golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Ryder Cup competitors for the United States Category:Golfers from Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Evansville, Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Bloomington, Indiana Category:1983 births Category:Living people ",
