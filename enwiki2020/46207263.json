He played third for Italy at the 2012 World Junior Curling Championships, on a team skipped by Andrea Pilzer. The team finished 9th. Mosaner then became skip of the Italian junior team for the next three World Juniors. At the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships, Mosaner led his team of Pilzer, Daniele Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 6th-place finish (5-4 record). At the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships, he led his team of Sebastiano Arman, Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 5th-place finish, losing in a tie-breaker to Switzerland. Finally, at the 2015 World Junior Curling Championships, he was less successful, leading his team of Sebastiano Arman, Carlo Gottardi and Fabio Ribotta to an 8th-place finish (3-6). While Mosaner played in four World Juniors, the highlight of his junior career came at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, where he skipped Italy to a silver medal finish. After a 4-3 round robin record, he led his team of Denise Pimpini, Alessandro Zoppi and Adriana Losano to playoff wins against the United States and Canada, before losing to Switzerland in the final. === Men's === During his junior career, Mosaner also skipped the Italian men's team. He led his teammates of Pilzer, Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 12th-place finish at the 2013 European Curling Championships. His team had much more success at the 2014 European Curling Championships. After finishing the round robin in 2nd place with a 7-2 record, they then lost all of their playoff games, including the bronze medal match, settling for 4th. This placement qualified Italy to play in the 2015 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. The team would add veteran Joel Retornaz to skip the team for the Worlds, with Mosaner throwing last rocks. There, the team finished 10th. The next season, the team finished 8th at the 2015 European Curling Championships, failing to qualify the country for the Worlds. For the 2016-17 season, Mosaner moved to the third position on the team. They finished 7th at the 2016 European Curling Championships, and qualified for the 2017 World Men's Curling Championship. There, Mosaner resumed his position throwing fourth rocks on the team, which finished 9th overall. The team finished 8th at the 2017 European Curling Championships, but had much more success a month later at the 2018 Winter Olympic Qualification Event. The team won the event, qualifying Italy for the 2018 Winter Olympics, where they finished 9th. They finished the season finishing 8th at the 2018 World Men's Curling Championship. Mosaner played third for Italy at the 2018 European Curling Championships, where the country won its first medal at the event since 1979, picking up a bronze. He played third for Italy again at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship, finishing in 7th place. Later that month, after winning the 2019 Italian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship he competed in the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship for the first time, with partner Alice Cobelli. The pair finished the round robin with a 5-2 record, in third place in their group. The pair missed out on the playoffs as their draw shot challenge (DSC) record was not good enough compared to the other third place teams. In January 2020 Mosaner together with Alice Cobelli won 2020 Italian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship and they will represent Italy on 2020 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. ==Personal life== In 2015, Mosaner was employed as a farmer. ==References== ==External links== * Category:People from Trento Category:1995 births Category:Italian male curlers Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Trentino Category:Competitors at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics Category:Curlers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic curlers of Italy Category:Italian curling champions ",
