    "text": "XHUAEM-FM, known as Radio UAEM, is a radio station serving Cuernavaca, Morelos. It is owned by the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Morelos and has statewide coverage with repeaters installed at the UAEM preparatory schools in Jojutla and Cuautla. ==History== 240px XHUAEM-FM received its permit in February 2000 and signed on July 14 of that year. The additional permits were received later in 2000; XHCUM-FM Cuautla launched on August 14, 2003, and XHJJM-FM in Jojutla took to the air on January 24, 2005. Radio UAEM was launched under rector Gerardo \u00c1vila Garc\u00eda and founding station director Francisco Orozco Jim\u00e9nez. After Ren\u00e9 Santove\u00f1a Arredondo was elected UAEM rector in December 2000, the station became known as UFM Alterna, a moniker that would be used until 2013 when it returned to \"Radio UAEM\" in a bid to emphasize its connection with the university. The new university outlet broadcast classical and alternative music, alongside a variety of locally produced and internationally sourced programs from Radio Francia Internacional, Radio Netherlands Worldwide and Radio Biling\u00fce in the United States. In 2008, the station moved to new studios in Building 40 on the north campus. ==Programming== Radio UAEM, like other university stations in Mexico, presents a mix of music and talk programs. The station broadcasts classical music from 9 a.m. to noon on weekdays as well as several specialty classical shows. Radio UAEM's own productions address varied topics including literature, sports and migration; the station also produces two editions of Panorama, a newscast, each weekday. Through exchange agreements, programs from Radio Educaci\u00f3n, Radio UNAM and the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio are also aired. ==Repeaters== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Callsign !!
