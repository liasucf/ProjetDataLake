The town councilman, last season's de facto dictator, tries to keep the town under his control, but struggles to keep the trust of the people when someone disobeys his authority with better alternatives for surviving. A new girl mysteriously appears in the town, and her past holds major clues to the Dome's origins. The mysterious egg, which is considered the Dome's power source, is still somewhere in town, and it gradually gives more answers, so it must be protected. Somebody has found a way out of the Dome, and is taken to Zenith, another town close to Chester's Mill, where he uncovers that a private company has been researching the Dome, but with possibly nefarious motivations. As the townspeople face the ultimate threat to their lives, they must decide whether to follow the route out from the Dome, not knowing exactly what awaits them outside if they do. == Cast and characters == The cast members portray characters that were mostly taken from the original novel, \"although some have been combined and others have changed jobs.\" === Main === * Mike Vogel as Dale 'Barbie' Barbara * Rachelle Lefevre as Julia Shumway * Natalie Martinez as Linda Esquivel * Britt Robertson as Angie McAlisterBritt Robertson is credited as \"Starring\" in the first episode, but credited as \"Guest starring\" in the tenth episode. * Alexander Koch as James 'Junior' Rennie * Eddie Cahill as Sam Verdreaux * Colin Ford as Joe McAlister * Nicholas Strong as Phil Bushey * Mackenzie Lintz as Norrie Calvert-Hill * Karla Crome as Rebecca Pine * Dean Norris as James 'Big Jim' Rennie ===Recurring=== * Aisha Hinds as Carolyn Hill * Jolene Purdy as Dodee Weaver * Grace Victoria Cox as Melanie Cross * John Elvis as Ben Drake * Dale Raoul as Andrea Grinnell * R.

However, other critics were more positive; Mark Dawidziak of The Plain Dealer wrote that \"If not top-tier TV terror fare, Under the Dome certainly is solid second-level stuff. And given the state of horror on television these days, that's a bloody good compliment. Even while acknowledging the occasional misstep, give Under the Dome credit for getting a lot of things right\", while Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that \"there are glimmers of hope for season two\". === Ratings === == References == == External links == * Under the Dome Season 2 Episode List on Internet Movie Database * Under the Dome on CBS on The Futon Critic Category:2014 American television seasons Season 2 ",
