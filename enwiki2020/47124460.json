    "text": "The Myanmar Press Council (; abbreviated MPC; formerly the Myanmar Core Press Council) is a media adjudication body which investigates and settles press disputes, compiles journalism ethics, and protects media personnel in Burma's media landscape. It was initially conceived as a Ministry of Information- appointed body consisting of 20 members, led by Chairman Khin Maung Lay, a retired Supreme Court judge, to regulate media affairs following the abolishment of pre-publication censorship. In response to local media criticism, it was reformed as an independent body involving privately owned media representatives. ==See also== *Censorship in Burma *Media of Burma ==References== ==External links== * Category:Media complaints authorities Category:Burmese journalism organisations Category:Journalism-related professional associations Category:Consumer organisations in Myanmar Category:Regulation in Myanmar ",
