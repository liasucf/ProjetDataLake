    "text": "Caritas Charles Vath College (), abbreviated as CCVC, is a secondary school located at Tung Chung, Lantau Island, Hong Kong operated under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) of the Education Bureau. It is a secondary school sponsored by the Caritas Hong Kong established in 2003, with the current principal Mr. Wong Wai. The school offers the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education course (HKDSE) as a ladder for students to continue their studies. The courses are divided into three major categories, including art and design, Tourism and hospitality, and business, which let students choose more heuristic and multiple disciplinary subjects in addition to regular curriculum. ==History== Mr. Charles Vath was the director of the Hong Kong Catholic Center, and the founder and president of Caritas Hong Kong since 1953. Caritas Hong Kong believes in caring for love and creating hope. Until the 2000s, a group of Form 3 students were taken from every school without promoting to Form 4. Then there were a large number of Form 5 students leaving the school after Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE). Under the past elitism system, students with poor academic performance would be eliminated. These students also had the right to receive education. Hong Kong's support for high school students is quite inadequate. This was also the reason for the appearance of senior high school in those years, which only admit students of Form 4 or above. Caritas Charles Vath College is a DSS high school that was funded by the government in 2003. The school is a senior high school in Hong Kong, which mainly runs Form 4 and above. Before the implementation of the new high school curriculum, the students needed to go through the HKCEE and Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE). During the two public examinations, many students became victims of the system and lost the opportunity to go directly to senior forms in the original school. For the students who intend to continue their studies, Caritas Charles Vath College's senior secondary courses opened up another path. In the past, the school provided a series of one-year professional certificate courses including the HKCEE, the HKALE. After 2012, it changed to provide the HKDSE courses, as well as other courses covering tourism, cosmetology, design, electronics certificate courses. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, classes were suspended and students were confined to distance education. Online learning was performed throughout the school period for all subjects. The emergence of the HKDSE has brought shocks to the school. The school transformed. Starting from the 2020/2021 school year, the school set up junior high form classes. However, the school pays special attention to the purpose of helping the most lost and unsaved students did not change. ==Campus environment== View of the school as seen from country park.

In additional to the regular classrooms in the teaching building, the school is equipped with different recreation rooms such as a dancing room, an English corner, a studio and a chapel. Other special rooms include a Cosmetology room, an MMLC, an Art room, an Animation room and an interactive computer room etc. ==School characteristics== ===Practical school=== The school aims to provide comprehensive education and multiple intelligence training. The school curriculum is divided into three categories: art and design, tourism, and business. The school retains some DSE subjects of grammar schools, and also provide some more interesting elective subjects. The curriculum structure is based on students' ability, inspiring their various abilities from different angles, and then affirming their self-worth. And the ultimate goal of creating continuous learning and employment expertise is to achieve lifelong learning.

The teachers pay special attention to the most helpless and humble students in society. The needs and demands of a group of those people, so- called 3L students, the Last, the Least and the Lost. This group of students has failed to adapt to traditional education and examinations. Compared with students with strong family support, disadvantaged students need more educational power. Every student are equal in morality and academics. Through the core values of Catholic Church, love, righteousness, truth, family and life, the school become a navigator in the lives of others, trigger their potential, and contribute for themselves, family and society. The school has an unwavering determination to fulfill the beliefs of the school sponsoring group, Caritas Hong Kong, and fully experience the mission of serving with love and creating hope.
