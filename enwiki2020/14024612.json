    "text": "KUOA (1290 AM) is a radio station. Licensed to Siloam Springs, Arkansas, United States, it serves the Fayetteville (North West Arkansas) area. The station is currently owned by Hog Radio, Inc. For many years, the station was owned by John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. In 2005, the university sold the radio station to longtime Northwest Arkansas broadcaster Dewey Johnson. He would subsequently retire from the radio business because of health problems. The station was sold later that year to Galen O. Gilbert, a former JBU student who had owned radio stations in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Gilbert restored the radio station to serve the Siloam Springs community, playing a classic country format. The station was sold in August 2008 to longtime Arkansas broadcaster Jay Bunyard, and became an all-sports radio station known as \"The Hog\". Paired with a brand new Fayetteville- licensed FM translator at 105.3 FM, the radio station went to live and local programming throughout the day, and focused mainly on Arkansas Razorback athletics. In 2010, Bunyard would go on to purchase KAKS-FM, and The Hog was moved to the 25,000 watt signal on 99.5 FM. On December 13, 2012, KUOA split from its simulcast with sports-formatted KAKS 99.5 FM and changed their format to talk, branded as \"AM 1290 The Mouth\". On January 1, 2015, KUOA resumed simulcasting sports-formatted KAKS 99.5 FM. KUOA rebroadcast on FM translator K249EV 97.7 FM licensed to Johnson, Arkansas. In November 2016, the translator moved frequencies to 95.3 FM, as K237GR. ==External links== * * UOA Category:Radio stations established in 1984 ",
