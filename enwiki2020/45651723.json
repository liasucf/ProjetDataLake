    "text": "{| |} The Argos-class patrol boat is a model of patrol boat in service in the Portuguese Navy since 1991. This type of ship was designed by the Arsenal do Alfeite, Lisbon, but was built in private shipyards located in Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio. The ships of the class are mainly employed in the surveillance and control of the Portuguese territorial waters, in Mainland Portugal and in the Madeira Archipelago. The ships are also employed in other missions as the search and rescue, maritime pollution control and force protection of combatant ships in confined waters. Five ships were built, these being named after constellations. In 2000, an upgraded version of the Argos-class entered service in the Portuguese Navy. This new version was initially referred as the Argos (2nd series)-class, but it is now usually referred to as the Centauro- class patrol boat. It is to note, that from 1963 to 1975, the Portuguese Navy employed a class of large patrol boats that was also designated Argos-class. ==Ships of the class== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Pennant !Name !Commissioned |- |P1150 |Argos |1991 |- |P1151 |Drag\u00e3o |1991 |- |P1152 |Escorpi\u00e3o |1991 |- |P1153 |Cassiopeia |1991 |- |P1154 |Hidra |1991 |- |} ==External links== * Argos-class, Portuguese Navy website Category:Naval ships of Portugal Category:Patrol vessels of Portugal Category:Patrol vessels Category:1990s ships Category:Ships built in Portugal ",
