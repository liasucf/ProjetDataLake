There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: \"..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, \"that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa\" rare. \" However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping. Alfieri, 1891, p. 117 It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445\u20131517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.Historical evolution of accountingBrief History of Accounting An Italian version was published in Venice in 1573 by Franciscus Patricius.

The \"Perfect Merchant\" or \"Perfect Dealer\" was a man of culture motivated to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljevi\u0107 wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a bookkeeper-accountant, but that he must also be a good writer, a rhetorician and a man of letters being diplomatic all the while.Markets of the Mediterranean He contrasted the \"Perfect Merchant\" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had delusions of grandeur and were not very diplomatic. == References == == Sources == * Original from Columbia University * * == Bibliography == *B.
