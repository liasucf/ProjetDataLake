This, along with other points the president made about the university's relationship with climate change activism and deniers, sparked a student protest and several petitions demanding for the university to divest immediately. At one of the protests, a student was pushed down the stairs of the President's home. In the same video, LeBlanc criticized majority rule over GW policy by saying, \"What if the majority of the students agreed to shoot all the black people here?\"https://www.facebook.com/archer.gallivan/videos/1498813073606531/?fref=nf Students quickly condemned the president's comments as \"racially insensitive\" and \"thoughtless.\"https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/02/02/leblanc-apologizes-for- insensitive-analogy-amid-backlash-from-sa-divestment-activists/ The president later apologized, saying \"The point I was making \u2013 that majority rule should never suppress the human rights of others \u2013 was obscured by the example I used...I regret my choice of words and any harm I unintentionally inflicted on a community I value greatly.\"https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/02/02/leblanc- apologizes-for-insensitive-analogy-amid-backlash-from-sa-divestment-activists/ Le Blanc additionally hired Heather Swain, who was expected to begin as Vice President of communications and marketing in the fall of 2020. Heather Swain had purposely withheld information and buried evidence on Larry Nassar, former USA Olympic gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University who was sentenced for child pornography and countless (at least 250) charges of sexual assault on minors. Swain eventually withdrew from the position due to student and faculty backlash, and after her withdrawal, Le Blanc issued a lackluster apology, in which he said, \"I accept full responsibility\" regarding her hiring, and that he \"should have recognized the sensitivities and implications of this hire. It is a mistake I deeply regret.\" ==References== ==External links== *GWU Office of the President About President LeBlanc Category:Presidents of George Washington University Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:State University of New York at Plattsburgh alumni ",
