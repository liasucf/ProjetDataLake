    "text": "Konstantin Stanislavski as Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters. This article offers a chronological list of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. It does not include theatrical productions in which Stanislavski only acted. Until he was thirty three, Stanislavski appeared only as an amateur onstage and as a director, as a result of his family's discouragement.Benedetti (1999a, 21, 24) and Carnicke (2000, 11). The prospect of becoming a professional actor was taboo for someone of Stanislavski's social class; actors had an even lower social status in Russia than in the rest of Europe, having only recently been serfs and the property of the nobility. When he was twenty five, he helped to establish a Society of Art and Literature, which aimed to unite amateur and professional actors and artists.Magarshack (1950, 52, 55\u201356). His professional career began in 1896 when he co-founded the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) with Vladimir Nemirovich- Danchenko.Benedetti (1999a, 61\u201364). Later in his life, he created a series of studios whose aims were primarily pedagogical but which also presented public performances.Gauss (1999). This list of productions directed by Stanislavski includes amateur, professional, and studio productions. When the sources disagree about the exact date of a production's premi\u00e8re, that given in the most recent biography of Stanislavski\u2014Jean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999)\u2014is listed here, with the alternative date detailed in the footnotes. Prior to 14 February 1918, the Julian calendar was in use in Russia, after which the Gregorian calendar was introduced.In the 19th century, the difference between the two calendars was twelve days; in the 20th, 13 days; see Gauss (1999, 6). The details of productions staged before that change are given in both Old Style and New Style dates. ==Productions at the Society of Art and Literature== Stanislavski and his wife Lilina in his adaptation of Dostoyevsky's The Village of Stepanchikovo (Foma) for the Society of Art and Literature.
