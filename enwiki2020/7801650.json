    "text": "The first bar of the Transcendental \u00c9tude No. 6 Franz Liszt's Transcendental \u00c9tude No. 6 in G minor \"Vision\" is the sixth of his twelve Transcendental \u00c9tudes. It is a study of the extensions of the hand, hands moving in opposite directions, arpeggiated double notes, and tremolos. It is one of the easiest \u00e9tudes out of Liszt's 12 Transcendental \u00c9tudes, though the beginning of the piece can be quite troublesome if it is played as directed: completely with the left hand (linked hand in the second edition [Dover]). It would require large stretches and dexterous leaps if done so. == Visual image == The visual image of this piece is a funeral. The middle section's wild octaves and rapidly climbing and descending arpeggios are filled with exaltation (as the original notes Franz Liszt scripted). == External links == * Transcendental 06 Category:1852 compositions Category:Compositions in G minor ",
