    "text": "Truepera is one genus of bacteria in the family Trueperaceae from the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus. Following points accounts for its characters: * These strains form orange/red colonies and have spherical-shaped cells. * Optimum growth temperature of about 50 \u00b0C. * Optimum pH for growth between about 7.5 and 9.5, and do not grow at pH below 6.5 or above pH 11.2. * They are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation. For instance up to 60% of the cells can survive even after being exposed to 5.0 kGy * These strains are chemo- organotrophic and aerobic; do not grow in Thermus medium under anaerobic conditions with or without nitrate as electron acceptor and glucose as a source of carbon and energy, but ferment glucose to d-lactate without formation of gas. They assimilate a large variety of sugars, organic acids and amino acids. * Species: Truepera radiovictrix. == References == Category:Deinococcus\u2013Thermus ",
