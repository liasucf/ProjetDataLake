In some rural areas, wireless technologies (WiMAX, LMDS, Satellite, HSDPA, ...) are used to provide wired- like services, the main provider of these services is Iberbanda (a Telef\u00f3nica subsidiary like Movistar), there are also other companies like San Pedro Wifi who are not part of the Telef\u00f3nica monopoly. Typically San Pedro Wifi can offer speeds over 100 Mbit/s. Virtually all wired connections are unmetered. Most broadband lines include free phone calls to land-lines within Spain and some include limited calls to mobile phones. Movistar offers 600Mbs asymmetrical in many cities throughout Spain. The most common speed in Spain is 100 Mbit/s as it is the default offer from Movistar, the main broadband supplier in the country. Clients of other DSL companies usually have higher speeds sold as \"M\u00e1xima velocidad\" (maximum speed) or \"Hasta 200 megas\" (up to 200 Mbit/s); in those offers the speed of the connection depends on the quality of the line (length of the wire, attenuation, noise) as those speeds are just at the limit of the ADSL2+ technology. Jazztel gets better results with its \"Hasta 300 megas\" (up to 300 Mbit/s) because that connection works with VDSL. In opposition to those unguaranteed offers, Ono, the main cable provider, sells its connections as \"x megas reales\" (x true Mbps). The main providers are: * Movistar - Former state telecom monopoly. * Orange * Vodafone * M\u00c1SM\u00d3VIL * Euskaltel Movistar, Vodafone, Orange and Euskaltel are the main providers offering TV packages with their broadband. == Mobile broadband == The use of mobile networks for Internet access is important due to the high penetration of smart and mobile phones in Spain. The use of USB devices for computers to connect to mobile networks is also common and some fixed broadband providers offer them for free or at low cost for use on holidays. People usually use flat rates for Internet with limits depending on the price, once that limit is reached, the speed falls from ~7 Mbit/s to ~128 kbit/s (depending on the provider) or the client pays for the extra amount of data downloaded. There are three 2G (GSM) networks, four 3G (UMTS, HDSPA, HSUPA, etc...) networks and LTE networks are being deployed. Nearly all of Spain is covered by at least UMTS. The main providers are: * Movistar - Former state telecom monopoly. * Orange * Vodafone * M\u00c1SM\u00d3VIL ==Internet censorship in Spain== There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or, as of 2012, reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.\"Spain\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 13 November 2013. Complaints about Internet censorship in Spain often focus on chilling effects that come from narrowing the definition of fair use. In 2014, for example, the Spanish version of Google News was shut down as continued operation would have required it to pay fees for each news link that it aggregates. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights. The law prohibits, subject to judicial oversight, actions including public speeches and the publication of documents that the government interprets as glorifying or supporting terrorism.

In 2009 the EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media, Viviane Reding, warned Spain against cutting off the Internet access of content pirates without a judicial proceeding. She said, \"If Spain cuts off Internet access without a procedure in front of a judge, it would certainly run into conflict with the European Commission\" and \"Repression alone will certainly not solve the problem of Internet piracy; it may in many ways even run counter to the rights and freedoms which are part of Europe's values since the French Revolution.\"\"Reding warns Spain against internet cut-off\", Reporters Without Borders, 3 December 2009.

On 13 September 2017, the Civil Guard seized referendum.cat, a Catalan website promoting the Catalan independence referendum, pursuant to an order by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia, as the country has considered the referendum to be illegal. The Guard subsequently obtained orders to seize other .cat domains hosting mirrors of the referendum website, and later on 23 September 2017, an order for all ISPs to block any website publicized by Catalan politicians as mirrors of the referendum website. Also censored was an HTTP gateway for the InterPlanetary File System\u2014a distributed file system that had been used to mirror the materials. On 10 October 2017, the Spanish Civil Guard blocked access to Whats-app groups of several pro-Catalan independence groups. As of December 2017, all previously blocked sites have once again been unblocked, with the focus shifting to taking the sites down directly. ==See also== * Ley Sinde, a provision in Spain's 2011 Sustainable Economy Act designed to address Internet piracy == References == ==External links== * ESNIC, Network Information Centre of Spain, domain name registrar.
