    "text": "Revision is a process in writing of rearranging, adding, or removing paragraphs, sentences, or words. Writers may revise their writing after a draft is complete or during the composing process. Revision is closely related to editing. Many writers go through multiple rounds of revisions before they reach a final draft: \"Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for transpositions... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.\" In an essay, revision may involve the identification of a thesis, a reconsideration of structure or organization, working at uncovering weaknesses, or clarifying unclear positions. In general, revision of written work can be guided by questions such as: * Is the writing clear? Does it make sense? * Is there enough information to describe ideas? * Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic? * Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order? Revision is not about improving grammar or diction, which are \"editing\". However, writer or the author may employ a strategy for both. There are theories such as the three-component model by Hayes and Flower and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production. Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often give corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities of the Internet, there are writers who \"crowdsource\" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations. ==References== Category:Writing Category:Textual scholarship Category:Composition (language) ",
