During his term, Lane faced a depleted treasury and a city budget of thirty million dollars. The municipal hospitals were unable to pay their bills and storm sewers were desperately needed after the havoc created by Hurricane Donna. Mayor Lane enforced stricter adherence to Civil Service hiring guidelines. He closed the Clara Frye Hospital for blacks and merged its services with the Tampa Municipal Hospital. Mayor Lane helped establish the Tampa Hospital Board and removed the hospitals from the city's direct administration. During his term of office, Julian Lane and the City Council expanded the construction of storm and sanitary sewers and the pavement of over two hundred miles of streets. Construction of a new public library building was approved and Redland Baseball Field was completed replacing Plant Field. Improvements were made along the public beach on Davis Causeway and 12.7 acres of riverfront land was purchased along the Hillsborough River. The city also began the Maryland Avenue Urban Renewal Project and built Community Centers in Interbay, West Tampa, and Forrest Hills. Mayor Lane also appointed a committee to study the proposed construction of Tampa Stadium. The Fire Department's manpower was increased by the addition of two hundred new firemen. There were also ninety-nine new fire hydrants installed in the City. In 1961, Lane supervised the transition when the City of Port Tampa and surrounding industrial areas were annexed into the City of Tampa. At the end of Mayor Lane's term, in September 1963, the first black children were enrolled in traditionally white schools at Jackson Heights and Westshore Elementary Schools. He worked closely with the Bi-Racial Committee to facilitate peaceful integration of downtown businesses. The Tampa Tribune also worked with the mayor to help ensure that integration in Tampa was as orderly as possible. Lane was defeated for re-election in 1963 by former mayor Nuccio, whom Lane had defeated in 1959. Lane served terms as a state representative, from 1970 to 1972, and as a state senator, from 1972 to 1976. == Retirement and legacy == Julian and his wife Frances Elizabeth LaMotte (1917-1998), had 4 children - Susan LaMotte Lane, Julian B.
