A diamond jubilee celebrates the 60th anniversary of a significant event related to a person (e.g. accession to the throne, wedding, etc.) or the 60th anniversary of an institution's founding. The term is also used for 75th anniversaries, although the human lifespan makes this usage more common for institutions. == Western monarchies == The Tolsey clock commemorates the Diamond Jubilee (60 years) of Queen Victoria's reign. The clock says \"1837 \u2013 1897\". It lies between Market Street and High Street in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, England. Diamond Jubilee window at the College of Engineering, Pune, India George III of the United Kingdom died a few months before his diamond jubilee was due in 1820. The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria celebrated her 60-year reign on 22 June 1897. The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was celebrated across the Commonwealth of Nations throughout 2012. Her next level of jubilee would be a platinum jubilee (in February 2022). == Asian monarchies== In East Asia, the diamond jubilee coincides with the traditional 60-year sexagenary cycle, which is held in special importance despite not generally being called a \"diamond jubilee.\" Monarchs such as the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of China and Emperor Hirohito of Japan held celebrations for their 60th year of reign, as did King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand on 10 June 2006. National governments also mark their 60th anniversary as diamond jubilees, as did the Republic of Korea in 2005 and the People's Republic of China in 2009. In South Asia, the term is also used for certain 100-week anniversaries. For instance, in both India and Pakistan, a diamond jubilee film is one shown in cinemas for 100 weeks or more. ==African monarchies== The longest reigning monarch in history, Sobhuza II of Swaziland, celebrated his (60 year) diamond jubilee in 1981, dating from when he gained direct rule. There does not appear to have been any (75 year) diamond jubilee celebration. == List of diamond jubilees == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Monarch ! Realm ! Accession Day ! Commemoration !
