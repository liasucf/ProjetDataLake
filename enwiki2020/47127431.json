Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1185462. Lake Rose was built by Jesse Dodson, a squatter who made bedsteads out of cherry trees, and built the lake as a log splash pond. In 1905, Colonel R. Bruce Ricketts reinforced the Lake Rose dam. However, due to the dam's poor construction, the lake could not be used for hydroelectric power. In the middle of the 20th century, the state of Pennsylvania condemned the dam and drained the lake. In 1950, some studies were being done by the Division of Dams on dams or dam repairs at Lake Rose. The Ganoga Glen Trail in Ricketts Glen State Park passes near Lake Rose, as does the Highland Trail. ==Biology== A Menziesia pilosa shrub was once observed in the vicinity of Lake Rose. Highbrush blueberry also occurs in the vicinity of the lake. Certain types of wildlife can occur in the vicinity of Lake Rose, depending on the time of year. Birds in this area include white-throated sparrows, mallard ducks, and evening grosbeaks. Insect species include monarch butterflies, sulfur butterflies, and various species of dragonfly. The lake was stocked with fish as late as 1980. ==See also== *List of lakes in Pennsylvania ==References== ==External links== *USGS 01538908 Lake Rose, PA Category:Lakes of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Category:Lakes of Pennsylvania ",
