    "text": "Taiwanese animation can be traced back to 1954's black-and-white animation Wu Song Fights the Tiger (\u6b66\u677e\u6253\u864e) by the Kuei Brothers but the earliest surviving is The Race Between Turtle and Rabbit (\u9f9c\u5154\u8cfd\u8dd1) produced at the end of the 1960s by the Kuangchi Program Service and was also the first color animation in Taiwan. In the 1970s, Taiwanese animators went abroad to study the animation production techniques in the United States and Japan, opening up Taiwan's OEM animation and homemade industry. ==1950s and 1960s== In the 1950s and 1960s, Taiwanese leisure activities were primarily watching film, television, folk opera and glove puppetry. Although American cartoons were broadcast in Taiwan, it was generally perceived to be detrimental to students' studies and increased risk of dropping out, however there were already some Taiwanese experimenting with making short length animations. In 1961, Fr. Philip L. Bourett, S.J. (\u535c\u7acb\u8f1d\u795e\u7236) founded the Kuangchi Program Service (KPS) and began the development of Taiwan's multimedia industry by purchasing used animation equipment from the United States, this could be considered the formal beginnings of Taiwanese animation. In 1963, Fr. Bourret recommended Linus Zao (\u8d99\u6fa4\u4fee Chao Tse-hsiu / Zhao Zexiu) to be trained in animation at Disney in Hollywood. Linus had previously worked at Toei Animation from 1959. Upon Linus's return to Taiwan in 1965, the animation department at KPS was established. The first production was Uncle Stone's Letter (\u77f3\u982d\u4f2f\u7684\u4fe1) in 1968 followed by The Tortoise and the Hare in 1969. This won him a Golden Horse Award and he was given the honorary title of \"Father of Taiwanese Animation\" and the nickname \"Taiwan's Walt Disney\" In 1970, due to financial factors, the animation department was shut down and Linus left KPS. He went on to found his very own animation studio, Linus Art Studio (\u6fa4\u4fee\u7f8e\u8853\u88fd\u4f5c\u6240), and continued to produce commercials and social education films, this was one of Taiwan's early institutions specializing in cultivating animation talent, but all operations ceased after Linus moved to Hawaii in 1971 to take up a position at the University of Hawaii where he taught and worked as a freelance painter until 2003. ==1970s== Japanese animation developed at a rapid pace between 1962 and 1970, so much so that Toei in Japan built a new film factory specifically for TV animation. With such rapid development gave rise to the problem of increased production costs so Japanese companies looked overseas to foreign animation companies to take over production work. In 1970, Ying Jen Cartoon Production Center (\u5f71\u4eba\u5361\u901a\u88fd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5fc3) was set up, consisting of twelve animators. Japanese animators Kusube Daikichirou (\u6960\u90e8\u5927\u5409\u90ce), Tsutomu Shibayama, and Otsuka Yasuo went to Taipei to work with Ying Jen, who were in charge of subcontracting Japanese animation, while the original art were all drawn by the Japanese original artists. All tools such as rulers, pens, and celluloid were strictly imported from Japan. Animations such as Star of the Giants and The Oriental Witches (\u6771\u6d0b\u306e\u9b54\u5973) were produced by Ying Jen Cartoons. However, after a little over a year, the Republic of China and Japan severed diplomatic relations, in addition, the salary of an animation artist at the time was not sufficient to live on (One animation page was worth three NTD), hence Ying Jen declared its dissolution. In 1971, Teng You-li (\u9127\u6709\u7acb), who would later be named in 1975 as one of the Republic of China Ten Outstanding Young Persons (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u5341\u5927\u5091\u51fa\u9752\u5e74), hired several animation artists from Ying Jen and founded Chinese Cartoon Production. But Teng decided to go a different route than Ying Jen by making homemade animation. In 1972, New Journey to the West (\u65b0\u897f\u904a\u8a18), an experimental film directed by Chu Ming-tsan (\u6731\u660e\u71e6) was released and reported about by TTV, CTV and other cable television networks and print media. The news spread to Hong Kong filmmakers and reached the ear of South Sea Film & Co (\u9999\u6e2f\u5357\u6d77\u5f71\u696d\u516c\u53f8) director Cheung Ying (\u5f35\u82f1), Cheung discussed working with Chinese Cartoon Production and decided to fund the making of the animated film Creation of the Gods. When making Creation of the Gods (\u5c01\u795e\u699c), Chinese Cartoon Production were still in the stages of exploring screenwriting and character design. Although they invited Hong Kong screenwriter San Gong-seh (\u7533\u6c5f\u5beb) to write the script, San wrote plays for movies and did not understand the nature of animation, the script become too large. Although they seized the opportunity of Bruce Lee's passing by adding wuxia and kung fu elements, the box office performance was not good. Fred Tan (\u4f46\u6f22\u7ae0 Tan Han-chung) once critiqued: \"Children don't understand it and adults aren't willing to watch it.\"\u300c\u5c0f\u5b69\u5b50\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u3001\u5927\u4eba\u4e0d\u9858\u610f\u770b\u3002\u300d In 1979, Tsai Ming-chin (\u8521\u660e\u6b3d) served as one of the directors for the Chinese Cartoon Production and Toei collaboration animated film Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The film won the award for Best Cartoon at the 1980 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards but performed poorly at the box office. There were no computer special effects at the time and it was quite a feat to animate the large scale battle scenes. In 1974, Linus Zao's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Huang Mu-tsun (\u9ec3\u6728\u6751 Huang Mucun) founded China Youth Animation Development Company (\u4e2d\u570b\u9752\u5e74\u52d5\u756b\u958b\u767c\u516c\u53f8), abbreviated to Chung Ching (\u4e2d\u9752 Zhongqing), which mainly produced animated social education works. In 1977, Before It Rains (\u672a\u96e8\u7da2\u7e46) whose theme is family planning, won the 14th Golden Horse Award for Best Cartoon, which was the first ever awarded to an animated film. In 1974, Tsai Chih-chung (\u8521\u5fd7\u5fe0) directed the animated title sequence for the TV series, The Stupid Son-in-law (\u50bb\u5973\u5a7f), this was the first in Taiwan. ==1980s== In 1978, James Wang who had returned to Taiwan after studying abroad in the United States, founded Wang Film Productions, which focused on accepting outsourced orders from American production companies such as Hanna-Barbera and Disney. Through its use of American corporate management methods and hiring of concept artists at high prices, it became the world's largest subcontracted animation production center in the world by export volume; at the same time it killed off smaller animation companies that could not compete. Wang Film Productions and Ying Jen had deeply influenced Taiwanese animation though the introduction of American and Japanese animation respectively. Original animation in the 1970s mostly derived from adaptations of traditional Chinese stories, however in the 1980s Taiwanese animation turned to adapting best-selling manhua, an example is Far East Cartoon's adaptation of the Hong Kong comic directed by Joseph Wong Chak and \u8b1d\u91d1\u5857 (Che Gam-Tiu/Tse Cham To/Hsieh Chin-tu) called Old Master Q. It was adapted from the four panel style comic and in addition to its funny plots, it incorporated showdown duels of Bruce Lee, the blind swordsman (Zatoichi), and Ore wa Teppei. It was a big success at the box office in both Hong Kong and Taiwan with turnover in excess of 100 million NTD. It won the Best Cartoon award at the 18th Golden Horse Awards in 1981. In 1983, Far East Cartoon adapted Ao You-hsiang's (\u6556\u5e7c\u7965) four panel comic Messy Temple (\u70cf\u9f8d\u9662) for the big screen and directed by Tsai Chih-chung. But due to quality issues by its partner company, the finished work was very flawed and compounded by the lack of introducing fresh new story plots, it did not perform well at the box office and subsequently the popularity of manhua adaptations quickly faded. Wang Film Productions's adaptation of Brother Ox Cartoons' (\u725b\u54e5\u6f2b\u756b) Uncle Niou's Great Adventure (\u725b\u4f2f\u4f2f\u725b\u5c0f\u59b9\u5927\u7834\u947d\u77f3\u9ee8), directed by Yu Wei-cheng (\u4f59\u70ba\u653f), was the last of the wave in popularity of manhua adaptation. It was not shown on the big screen. Unlike adapting traditional stories, there were problems of character design when adapting manhua. Often audience would lose interest if the character design differed too much from the original or if there is a change in style of drawing. Funding and scripts were also problems that plagued Taiwanese animation. In 1983, although Uncle Ox (\u725b\u4f2f\u4f2f) was nominated for a Golden Horse award in 1981, the last best cartoon award went to Bremen 4: Angels in Hell (\u56db\u795e\u5947 Japanese: \u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30e1\u30f34 \u5730\u7344\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u5929\u4f7f\u305f\u3061) produced by Tai Wei Cartoon (\u6cf0\u5a01\u516c\u53f8) in collaboration with Osamu Tezuka. This also led to the decline in homemade Taiwanese animation. After mid-1980s, Taiwan's animation industry largely depended upon American subcontracting to support it. Initially, TV animation was undertaken then gradually Disney animated films. At this time Taiwan's subcontracted animation industry had surprisingly matured: by 1987, when Wang Film Productions opened a new building, they were producing as many as 170 to 190 works yearly and hired over one hundred concept artists. Due to its staggering output and efficiency, Wang Film Productions was nicknamed the \"Magic Cuckoo's Nest\" by Hollywood. Although Taiwan's subcontracted animation industry underwent amazing development, this was a time when much of American and Japanese subcontracted animations were rapidly dumped back in Taiwan. Foreign animation eroded the original animation market so much so that there was hardly any homemade animations on any television channels in Taiwan. Non-celluloid animations include Cheng Chen- yi's (\u5f35\u632f\u76ca) Impression from My Childhood (\u5152\u6642\u5370\u8c61) in 1985 and the clay animation Cat Hiding (\u8eb2\u8c93\u8c93) in 1987. There is also Broadcast Development Foundation's (\u5ee3\u96fb\u57fa\u91d1\u6703) Grandfather's Stories (\u963f\u516c\u8b1b\u53e4) and Li Han-wen's (\u674e\u6f22\u6587) and David Tao Sr.'s (\u9676\u5927\u5049) collaborative paper carving animation work The Adventures of Little Calabash (\u5c0f\u846b\u8606\u6b77\u96aa\u8a18). However, these animations were not combined with any business models. ==1990s== In the early 1990s, Taiwan's economy picked up, the New Taiwan Dollar was gaining value and wages were on the rise, these factors steadily increased production costs of the subcontract industry. To reduce costs, animation subcontract factories were set up and relocated to mainland China and Southeast Asia. In 1989, Sam Wang (\u738b\u4e9e\u6cc9)/Wang Yaquan founded Morning Sun Animation (\u671d\u967d\u52d5\u756b), the first Taiwanese animation company founded on the mainland. As the subcontract industry relocated abroad, Taiwan's animation industry gradually geared towards creativity and research and development to survive. In the 1990s, the information bureau used funds to subsidize several feature-length animation works, including Far East's Tsai Chih-chung's original work Zen Taipei Ah-Kuan (\u79aa\u8aaa\u963f\u5bec) directed by You Jing-Yuan (\u6e38\u666f\u6e90). Animation and coloring were produced on the mainland while directing, original concept and editing were all produced in Taiwan, although its box office performance did not fair too well, videotape sales did, and it won the Special Jury Award (\u91d1\u99ac\u734e\u8a55\u5be9\u7279\u5225\u734e) at the 31st Golden Horse award. In 1998, Grandma and Her Ghosts (\u9b54\u6cd5\u963f\u5abd), directed by Wang Hsiao-ti (\u738b\u5c0f\u68e3) and with South Korean collaboration, used the theme of Taiwanese local customs and folk beliefs which resonated with the Taiwanese community and was recognized for Best Film at the 1st Taipei Film Festival, but because the Gold Horse Award judges deemed the film's plot to be outlandish, the film missed out on Best animated film award at the 35th Gold Horse Award. Also in 1998, Kang Chin-Ho (\u5eb7\u9032\u548c) directed Kavalan (\u5c11\u5e74\u5676\u746a\u862d), funded by PTS and filmed by Wang Film Productions, the theme is an aborigine tale handed down in the Kabalan Plain, describing the protagonist transcending space and time to return to the plain in olden times. The art design was not bad but due to a lack of understanding of Taiwanese aborigine culture, the animation was not well valued by the aborigines. Apart from homemade films, Taiwanese animation also sought collaboration with other countries. In 1994, in preparation for public broadcast, NHK and South Korea's KBS funded the production of Confucius (\u5b54\u5b50\u50b3), but due to a decree and various factors, it was not shown in the cinemas; In 1995, Lin Cheng-te's manhua Young Guns was adapted and made into two sets of OVAs using the methods from their collaboration with the Japanese, and sold pretty well in retail market. In 1995, the feature-length American 3D animation Toy Story had a great impact on the animation industry. At the same time Taiwan's 3D animation short The Sky of Little-Sun (\u5c0f\u967d\u5149\u7684\u5929\u7a7a) directed by Cheng Fen-Fen (\u912d\u82ac\u82ac) and produced by the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation had just been completed, the story follows the story between an ordinary girl and girl with burns; at this time Wang Film Productions also entered into the 3D animation subcontracting industry. ==2000s== The wave of digitization was sweeping the world and animation was no exception. Globalization and creativity became increasingly important to animation production. In view of the success of South Korea's government subsidized internet gaming and digital animation industries, the Taiwanese government set up the Digital Content Institute (\u6578\u4f4d\u5167\u5bb9\u5b78\u9662) in 2003 to encourage the development of Taiwan's digital gaming and animation industries. In 1989, Chen Keng-pin (\u9673\u803f\u5f6c), the original artist of Far East Cartooon's Old Master Q, set up David Images Company (\u5927\u885b\u6578\u4f4d\u85dd\u8853\u516c\u53f8) and introduced a full set of American 3D equipment and produced Taiwan's first 3D animation commercial Kolin thousand dollar ant transformer (\u6b4c\u6797\u5343\u5143\u8b8a\u8eab\u879e\u87fb), Tatung Space Baby (\u5927\u540c\u592a\u7a7a\u5bf6\u5bf6\u7bc7), etc., and cooperated with film director Ting Shan-hsi (\u4e01\u5584\u74bd) in 1993 to produce Taiwan's first action film with 3D CGI, The Magic Sword (\u5c07\u90aa\u795e\u528d) and marked the beginning of Taiwan's 3D animation. Towards the end of the 1990s, Spring House Entertainment Technology (\u6625\u6c34\u5802\u79d1\u6280) produced an online animation A-Kuei (\u963f\u8cb4) which was very successful, in 2002 it was adapted into a feature-length animation A-Kuei's Gonna Hammer You (\u963f\u8cb4\u69cc\u4f60\u5594), this was the first digital animation to receive government subsidy, and the first Flash animation to appear on the big screen. Other notable digital animations are Butterfly Lovers: Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai(\u8774\u8776\u5922- \u6881\u5c71\u4f2f\u8207\u795d\u82f1\u53f0) in 2003 and Wang Film Productions's Fire Ball (\u7d05\u5b69\u5152\uff1a\u6c7a\u6230\u706b\u7130\u5c71) in 2005, both combining traditional Chinese fables with 3D animation. Animation in the 2000s, aside from simple productions, also needed to solve the problems of script writing, marketing, and globalization, which can't be solved just by training animation artists. As a result, several animation companies actively sought international collaboration, to absorb the internationally successful business model and seize the opportunity for expansion. \"Huei Yu? (no English equivalent)\" (\u6703\u5b87\u591a\u5a92\u9ad4\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) produced The Kids' Ten Commandments (\u5152\u7ae5\u5341\u8aa1) targeted at the European and North American market in collaboration with Mondo Media. In 2004, the TV animation Pandamonium was broadcast in Taiwan, Japan, Chinese mainland, Europe, United States, South Korea, etc. They also experimented with selling merchandise through trade partnership with companies in other industries to increase revenue. In summer of 2007, Matsu: Legend of the Sea (\u6d77\u4e4b\u50b3\u8aaa\uff0d\u5abd\u7956) was produced by Chinese Cartoon Production (\u4e2d\u83ef\u5361\u901a) in collaboration with Dajia Jenn Lann Temple to release merchandise and do publicity. In this way, the business model of Taiwanese model gradually matured. In 2007, early 2D subcontract factory Far Eastern Cartoons (\u9060\u6771\u5361\u901a\u516c\u53f8) last owned by Kao Chin- yuan (\u9ad8\u9326\u6e90) was not operating too well and the decision was made to quit the subcontracting business and set up a new company using the old name Far Eastern (\u9060\u6771) but adding on Animation Tech (\u52d5\u756b\u79d1\u6280). Far Eastern Animation Tech set up an office in Beijing which focused on a new development angle between multimedia businesses and animation production. This was also the first instance of a Taiwanese animation company officially collaborating with a Chinese mainland company, the Beijing-based Songlei Culture Group (\u677e\u96f7\u6587\u5316\u96c6\u5718) whose office operations focused on the creation and production of original animation, cellphone and digital content and established a flagship store for Creative Culture Products (\u6587\u5316\u5275\u610f\u5546\u54c1) at the Forbidden City in Beijing. This collaboration allowed the support and exchanges with mainland China's official institution on copyright trading, Beijing Film Academy and Bright China Foundation (\u5149\u83ef\u57fa\u91d1\u6703). In 2009, the 44th Golden Bell Awards introduced the Best Animation Programme category which has been awarded every year since. ==2010s== With the rise of digital media after 2010, 3D animation, visual effects, and digital media were being promoted as universities set up relevant departments to cultivate new talent. Students who studied abroad return with new concepts and technologies, start up their own animation studios. By converging digital technology with international standards and through interaction and sharing of experiences over the web, a fresh atmosphere has been injected into a new generation. Some independent studios began to actively invest in developing homemade animation. In recent years, particularly Venerable Jian-Zhen (\u9451\u771f\u5927\u548c\u5c1a) in 2010, Memory Loss (\u61b6\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u5192\u96aa) in 2011, Silent Code (BBS\u9109\u6c11\u7684\u6b63\u7fa9) in 2012, Mida (\u5922\u898b), A Little Bird (\u6211\u662f\u96bb\u5c0f\u5c0f\u9ce5) in 2013, Barion (\u91cd\u7532\u6a5f\u795e Baryon) in 2016, one by one Taiwanese animation are being created for the cinema and appears to be on a slow but gradual reemergence possibly one day joining American and Japanese animation to be enjoyed around the world. ==Directors== The following are well known animation directors who produced feature-length animated films and animated television programs since the 1990s. *Wang Ya-chuan (\u738b\u4e9e\u6cc9 Wang Yaquan) *Wang Hsiao-ti (\u738b\u5c0f\u68e3 Wang Xiaodi) *Shih Chang-chieh (\u77f3\u660c\u6770 Shi Changjie) *Lin Po-liang (\u6797\u535a\u826f Lin Boliang) *Wang Tung (\u738b\u7ae5 Wang Tong) *Chiu Li-wei (\u90b1\u7acb\u5049 Qiu Liwei) *Yang Shao-chang (\u694a\u7d39\u660c Yang Shaochang) *Wang Shih-wei (\u738b\u4e16\u5049 Wang Shiwei) *Tsai Ming-chin (\u8521\u660e\u6b3d Cai Mingqin) *Bunny Lin (\u6797\u4e16\u4ec1 Lin Shih-jen / Lin Shiren) *Chu Chi (\u6731\u9a0f Zhu Qi) *Jerry Lee (\u674e\u6625\u6c38 Lee Chun-yung / Li Chunyong) *Oscar Lin (\u6797\u660e\u6770 Lin Ming-chieh / Lin Mingjie) *Tsai Chih-chung (\u8521\u5fd7\u5fe0 Cai Zhizhong) ;Other directors *Chi Po-chou (\u7d00\u67cf\u821fJi Bozhou) *Tsai Jhih-wei (\u8521\u81f3\u7dad Cai Zhiwei) *Chiu Yi-hsun (\u90b1\u5955\u52f3 Qiu Yixun): Magical Painting (\u795e\u756b) ==See also== *Anime *Chinese animation *Dongman *Korean animation *Manhua ==References== * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Anima Exhibition, Digital Arts Center, Taipei Category:Chinese art ",
