    "text": "The putative \"Eurabia\", consisting of the combined area of the European Union (current and prospective members), and of the European Free Trade Area, and of the members and some observer states of the Arab League (except Comoros), as well as of Israel and the United Kingdom. Eurabia is a political neologism, a portmanteau of Europe and Arabia, used to describe a far-right Islamophobic conspiracy theory, involving globalist entities allegedly led by French and Arab powers, to Islamise and Arabise Europe, thereby weakening its existing culture and undermining a previous alignment with the U.S. and Israel. The concept was coined by British author Bat Ye'or (pen name of Gis\u00e8le Littman) in the early 2000s and is described in her 2005 book titled Eurabia: The Euro\u2010Arab Axis. Benjamin Lee of the Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats at the University of Lancaster describes her work as arguing that Europe \"has surrendered to Islam and is in a state of submission (described as dhimmitude) in which Europe is forced to deny its own culture, stand silently by in the face of Muslim atrocities, accept Muslim immigration, and pay tribute through various types of economic assistance.\" According to the theory, the blame rests with a range of groups including communists, fascists, the media, universities, mosques and Islamic cultural centres, European bureaucrats, and the Euro-Arab Dialogue. The term has gained some public interest and has been used and discussed across a wide range of the political spectrum, including right-wing activists, counter-jihadis and different sorts of anti-Islamic, and conservative activists. Bat Ye'or's \u201cmother conspiracy theory\u201d has been used for further subtheories. The narrative grew important in expressing anti-Islamic sentiments and was used by movements like Stop Islamisation of Europe. It gained renewed interest after the 9/11 events and the use of the term by 2011 Norway attacker, Anders Behring Breivik. Ye'or's thesis has come under criticism by scholars, which intensified after Breivik\u2019s crime. The conspiracy has been described as having resemblance to the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Eurabia is also discussed in classical anti-Europeanism, a strong influence in the culture of the United States and in the notion of American exceptionalism,Anti-Europeanism and Euroscepticism in the United States, Patrick Chamorel No 25, EUI-RSCAS Working Papers from European University Institute (EUI), Robert Schuman Centre of Advanced Studies (RSCAS) 2004 which sometimes sees Europe on the decline or as a rising rival power, or, as is the case here, both. == Basic narrative == In Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis, Bat Ye'or says that Eurabia is the result of the Euro-Arab Dialogue, based on an allegedly French-led European policy intended to increase European power against the United States by aligning its interests with those of the Arab countries. During the 1973 oil crisis, the European Economic Community (predecessor of the European Union), had entered into the Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) with the Arab League. Ye'or says it as a primary cause of alleged European hostility to Israel, referring to joint Euro-Arab foreign policies that she characterises as anti-American and anti-Zionist. Ye'or purported a close connection of a Eurabia conspiracy and used the term \"dhimmitude\", denoting alleged \"western subjection to Islam\". The term itself is based on a newsletter published in the 1970s by the Comit\u00e9 europ\u00e9en de coordination des associations d'amiti\u00e9 avec le monde Arabe, a Euro-Arab friendship committee., English translation Bat Ye'or's Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis was the first print publication in the Eurabia genre, which has since grown to a number of titles, including Melanie Phillips' Londonistan, Oriana Fallaci's The Force of Reason, and Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept. The term is often used by the writers Oriana Fallaci, Mark Steyn and several web sites, many of them affiliated with the counterjihad movement.including Gates of Vienna, Paul Beli\u00ebn's Brussels Journal, Front Page Magazine, Richard Landes's Eurabia article, Fjordman's The Eurabia Code article and his Defeating Eurabia compilation. Defeating Eurabia by Fjordman (the pen name of Peder Are N\u00f8stvold Jensen) (available online) earned him a high standing among far-right extremists. An important part of the narrative is the idea of a demographic threat, the fear that, at some time in the future, Islam will take over Europe. or as Bernard Lewis put it, \"Europe will be Islamic by the end of the century.\" Walter Laqueur's The Last Days of Europe: Epitaph for An Old Continent is quoted often among the Eurabia literature; however, he modified his statements later. ==Impact== === Post-1945 === While immigrants were being deemed a threat, in the postwar 1940s period, the British extreme right in particular, fascist politician Oswald Mosley were rather outspoken (see the Union Movement and the Europe a Nation slogan) in favour of a stronger integration of Britain with Europe and, using their own interpretation of the Eurafrica concept, Africa.Culture of Fascism: Visions of the Far Right in Britain, Julie V. Gottlieb, Thomas P. Linehan.B.Tauris, 31.12.2003, p.75DR\u00c1BIK, Jakub. Oswald Mosley\u00b4s Concept of a United Europe. A Contribution to the Study of Pan-European Nationalism. In. The Twentieth Century, 2/2012, s. 53-65, Prague : Charles University in Prague, ISSN 1803-750X === Post-9/11 significance === After the September 11 attacks by Islamic terrorists, all Muslims and the Arab world became perceived by some as threat. Muslim minority populations and Muslim immigration gained new political significance. Scholar Jos\u00e9 Pedro Z\u00faquete notes that > the threat that the Crescent will rise over the continent and the spectre of > a Muslim Europe have become basic ideological features and themes of the > European extreme right Eurabia had then re-entered into the vocabulary through Bat Ye'or's work, most notably the book published in 2005, Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis, although she first used the term in 2002. Subsequently, the coining of the term has been attributed to her. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson referred to the concept, which he took as the potential future Islamisation of Europe based on demographic facts and ideational lack of the continent. === 2010s Europe === The idea of a Eurabian conspiracy has become a basic theme in the European extremist and populist right and expresses as well a significant strategy change. This has led to the adoption of political positions that were previously considered fringe or third rail on either side. The main anti- Islamic theme has also penetrated into mainstream European politics, for instance in the case of Dutch populist Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders: > This government is enthusiastically co-operating with the Islamisation of > the Netherlands. In all of Europe the elite opens the floodgates wide. In > only a little while, one in five people in the European Union will be > Muslim. Good news for this multiculti-government that views bowing to the > horrors of Allah as its most important task. Good news for the CDA : C-D-A, > in the meanwhile stands for Christians Serve Allah (Christenen Dienen > Allah). Significant alterations in the asserted positions of the political (far) right include a sudden focus on the rights of women and homosexuals. == Issues == Mainland territories of the member states of the European Union (European Communities pre-1993), animated in order of accession. Contrary to the Eurabia narrative, the largest Muslim territorium, Algeria, formally a part of France until 1962, left the Communities on its independence from France. Some academics have described the Eurabia concept as an Islamophobic conspiracy theory. Eurabia shortcuts the complex interaction between the US, France, Israel, the Arabic and Muslim countries on an \"us against them\" basis. The Eurabia theories are dismissed as Islamophobic, extremist and conspiracy theories in the academic community.See: * * * * * * At first academics showed little interest in the Eurabia theories due to their lack of factual basis. The theme was treated in studies of rightist extremism and Middle East Politics. This changed after the 2011 Norway attacks, which resulted in the publication of several works specifically treating the Eurabia conspiracy theories. Janne Haaland Matl\u00e1ry went as far as to say that \"it is poor use of time to analyse something so primitive\". === Demography === The Pew Research Center said in 2011 that \"the data that we have isn't pointing in the direction of 'Eurabia' at all\",Brian Grim quoted in Richard Greene, World Muslim population doubling, report projects, CNN, 2011-01-27 and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to 8% in 2030. In 2007 academics who analysed the demographics dismissed the predictions that the EU would have Muslim majorities. It is completely reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase, and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant imprint on European life.Kaufmann, Eric (20 March 2010). \"Europe's Muslim Future\", Prospect, Issue 169. The prospect of a homogeneous Muslim community per se, or a Muslim majority in Europe is however out of the question. Justin Va\u00efsse seeks to discredit what he calls, \"four myths of the alarmist school\", using Muslims in France as an example. Specifically he has written that the Muslim population growth rate was lower than that predicted by Eurabia, partly because the fertility rate of immigrants declines with integration.See also Randy McDonald, France, its Muslims, and the Future, 2004-04-13, Doug Saunders, \"The 'Eurabia' myth deserves a debunking \", The Globe and Mail, 2008-09-20, Fewer differences between foreign born and Swedish born childbearing women, Statistics Sweden, 2008-11-03, Mary Mederios Kent, Do Muslims have more children than other women in western Europe? , Population Reference Bureau, prb.org, February 2008; for fertility of Muslims outside Europe, see the sentence \"The dramatic decline in Iran's fertility provides a recent example of how strict Islamic practices can coexist with widespread use of family planning.\", and (the articles) Farzaneh Roudi-Fahimi and Mary Mederios Kent, Fertility Declining in the Middle East and North Africa , prb.org, April 2008, especially the figure 2, Mohammad Jalal Abbasi-Shavazi, Recent changes and the future of fertility in Iran, especially the figure 1; He further points out that Muslims are not a monolithic or cohesive group,See also \"Merely speaking of a 'Muslim community in France' can be misleading and inaccurate: like every immigrant population, Muslims in France exhibit strong cleavages based on the country of their origin, their social background, political orientation and ideology, and the branch or sect of Islam that they practice (when they do).\" in Justin Vaisse, Unrest in France, November 2005 , 2006-01-12 and that many Muslims do seek to integrate politically and socially. Finally, he wrote that despite their numbers, Muslims have had little influence on French foreign policy.See also Justin Va\u00efsse, La France et les musulmans: une politique \u00e9trang\u00e8re sous influence? , April 2007 Furthermore, leading European Muslims are rather outspoken against religious fundamentalism and are far from acknowledging Arab countries as a role model at all.Europas muslimische Eliten: Wer sie sind und was sie wollen Jytte Klausen, Campus Verlag, 13.03.2000Walter Laqueur (2009). Best of Times, Worst of Times. University Press of New England. p. 211. ==Spread of conspiracies and further influences == Examples of proponents use: === Europe === ==== Germany ==== In 2010, German politician Thilo Sarrazin released Germany Abolishes Itself. The book contends that with continued Islamic immigration, Germany will become a majority Muslim nation. Journalist Simon Kuper has argued that, with over 1 million copies sold, Sarrazin had done more to publicize the concept of Eurabia more than anybody else in Europe. In political campaigning for the 2019 European Parliament election, Germany's far-right party AfD used Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me's 1886 painting The Slave Market with the slogan \"Europeans vote AfD!\" and \"So Europe doesn't become Eurabia!\". Deutsche Welle reported that the reproduction of the painting suggestively depicted dark-skinned men with beards and foreign-dress \"inspecting the teeth of a nude white woman\". ==== Italy ==== In 2004, journalist Oriana Fallaci claimed that Muslim immigration and high fertility was part of the conspiracy theory. In 2005, Fallaci told The Wall Street Journal that \"Europe is no longer Europe\", adding \"it is 'Eurabia,' a colony of Islam\". In 2011, Francesco Speroni, a sitting MEP for Lega Nord, stated that he shared the same view as Anders Behring Breivik's idea \"that we are going towards Eurabia\". In the aftermath of the shooting, Speroni confirmed his agreement with Breivik on the conspiracy theory in an interview with Radio 24. In 2018, Giulio Meotti used the theory in relation to the demographics of Europe, writing that \"Europe is over. Its future will be a mix of Eurabia and a geriatric ward.\" In May 2019, ahead of the European elections, Lega Nord leader for Sarzana claimed that both the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists were attempting to bring about Eurabia. The day before the vote, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini endorsed the theory as a genuine threat. He insisted that a state of Eurabia had already occurred in Sweden, a claim which the Swedish embassy promptly denied with an official statement. Invoking the memory of Oriana Fallaci, he released an anti-migrant speech on Twitter, accompanied by the message \"No to Eurabia\". ==== Netherlands ==== In 2008, journalist Arthur van Amerongen described Molenbeek as \"Brussels: Eurabia\". Despite alleging that writer Wim van Rooy had already coined the phrase, Amerongen faced severe peer and media criticism for endorsing the conspiracy theory. After the November 2015 Paris attacks and discovery of a Brussels ISIL terror cell, photojournalist Teun Voeten agreed with Amerongen's description, calling the municipality an \"ethnic and religious enclave\". Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders, who serves in the Dutch House of Representatives, has openly stated that \"if we do not stop Islamification now, Eurabia and Netherabia will just be a matter of time.\" A supporter of the conspiracy theory, Wilders believes Muslim immigration to Europe is being driven by an agreement between the European Union and Islamic countries. He has delivered speeches in the Dutch parliament about Eurabia. ==== Norway ==== In 2008, Peder Are N\u00f8stvold Jensen, writing under his pseudonym Fjordman, published Defeating Eurabia. The book contends that 1 in 3 babies born in France are from a Muslim-background, and that there are hundreds of \"Muslim ghettos\" following Sharia law in the country, which Fjordman believes will either be overrun or face an impending civil war. 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, includes a lengthy discussion of and support for the \"Eurabia\" theory. It also contains several articles on the Eurabia theme by Bat Ye'or and Fjordman.See: * Full text * Full text * * * * * * * * * * As a result, the theory received widespread mainstream media attention following the attacks. In the verdict against Breivik, the court said that \"many people share Breivik's conspiracy theory, including the Eurabia theory. The court finds that very few people, however, share Breivik's idea that the alleged \"Islamization\" should be fought with terror.\"Smilende Breivik forn\u00f8yd med dommen , nettavisen.no, 24.08.12 Breivik has later identified himself as a fascist and voiced support for neo-Nazis, stating that he previously had exploited \"counterjihad\" rhetoric in order to protect \"ethno-nationalists\", thereby instead launching a media drive against what he deemed \"anti-nationalist counterjihad\"-supporters.\"Mass killer Breivik says wants to create fascist party\". Reuters. Sep 5, 2014. ==== United Kingdom ==== * * * The premises common to these theories are that a rapid demographic transition in Europe has been induced by \u201cEuropean politicians and civil servants\u201d, and will lead to a Muslim majority which will have an unchanging, hostile attitude toward their host nations. Other premises, such as acquiring the compliance of or control over bureaucracies, intelligentsias and European political leaders are frequent.For instance in: * * === North America === ==== Canada ==== Author Mark Steyn, described as a \"champion of 'Eurabia' myth\" by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, has predicted an emerging Eurabia region, captured by the religion of Islam and hostile to U.S. interests. Steyn's promotion of the conspiracy theory centres on European demographics, where he believes a culturally asserted Muslim mass will become the majority population and demand the assimilation of white Europeans. ==== United States ==== In the United States, the theories have found strong proponents in the Islamophobia movement,\"anti-Islam groups received more than $119 million in funding between 2008 and 2011.\u201d Furthermore, the report asserts that many of these prolific anti-Islam groups are \u201ctightly linked\u201d and some of the \u201ctop players\u201d receive huge paychecks. The founder of Jihad Watch, Robert Spencer, a renowned anti-Islam scholar, is said to have received a salary of more than $150,000, while the organization\u2019s revenues in the year 2012 were over $200,000. In an investigative paper published in 2011 and titled \u201cFear Inc.,\u201d the Center of American Progress (CAP) reveals a detailed list of donors that help support think tanks that perpetrate misinformation about Muslims and Islam. One such think tank is the Middle East Forum (MEF), lead by academic and scholar Daniel Pipes. In 2009, the MEF is said to have received funding of nearly $6 million. Pipes and his anti-Muslim hyperbole are well known.\"\"Leading Islamophobic figures like Pamela Geller, lawyer David Yerushalmi, Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum, commentator Steven Emerson, Robert Spencer and Frank Gaffney play a major role in the anti-Islamic lobby \" among them the president of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencersee for instance: * * * * * and political commentator Daniel Pipes.see for instance: * * * In May 2006, Fox News host John Gibson called for white Americans to have more babies, referencing a decline in the \"native population\" of Europe as an apparent demographic warning for the U.S. regarding Hispanic birthrates. In what Media Matters reported as fearmongering, he claimed that Eurabia was occurring in Europe. In his 2011\u20132012 run for the Republican presidential nomination, senator Rick Santorum warned that Europe was \"creating an opportunity for the creation of Eurabia\", and that the continent was \"losing, because they are not having children.\" Classicist Bruce Thornton is also a strong advocate for the theory. Eurabia theories have also been espoused by less typical conservatives, for example, Bruce Bawer, an American expatriate who has lived in Europe since the 1990s, and supported Ye'or's allegations that there was a deliberate, coordinated effort to create Eurabia. He offered guarded approval of some of Ye'or's ideas, but also wrote: \"I\u2019d strongly question the implication that the entire European political establishment has been in on the effort to unite Europe and the Arab world, and to this end has labored to encourage immigration and discourage integration.\", Bawer argued that many European politicians and policy makers, in efforts to gain approval of Muslim voters or to appeal to multiculturalism, were effectively allowing the creation of Muslim-only enclaves where basic human rights were ignored and events like honor killings had become commonplace.Bruce Bawer, Surrender: Appeasing Islam, Sacrificing Freedom, Doubleday, 2009-05-19, Bruce Bawer, The New Quislings: How the International Left Used the Oslo Massacre to Silence Debate About Islam, Broadside Books, 2012-01-31, A 2007 film outline by Steve Bannon, who would later become the chief strategist for President Donald Trump and a member of the U.S. National Security Council, proposed that Muslims were trying to turn the United States into the \"Islamic States of America\". ==Criticism== The Economist rejected the concept of Eurabia as \"scaremongering\". Simon Kuper in Financial Times described Ye'or's book as \"little-read but influential\", and akin to \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion in reverse\", adding that \"though ludicrous, Eurabia became the spiritual mother of a genre\". David Aaronovitch acknowledges that the threat of \"jihadist terror\" may be real, but that there is no threat of Eurabia. Aaronovitch concludes that those who study conspiracy theories will recognize Eurabia to be a theory that adds the \"Sad Dupes thesis to the Enemy Within idea\". Conservative US military analyst Ralph Peters has criticized the Eurabia narrative on the grounds that it is unlikely to happen as posited, citing the historical precedent of genocides frequently occurring in Europe, such as in the Balkans during the 1990s and the Holocaust during World War II. Peters stated that if Muslims \"taking over\" Europe were imminent, Europeans would either forcibly deport their Muslims at best or engage in a genocide of them at worst, possibly leading to a U.S. intervention on behalf of persecuted Muslims. In his book Wars of Blood and Faith, Peters states that far from being about to take over Europe through demographic change, \"Europe's Muslims are living on borrowed time\" and that in the event of a major terrorist attack in Europe, thanks to the \"ineradicable viciousness\" of Europeans and what he perceives as a historical tendency to over-react to real or perceived threats, European Muslims \"will be lucky if they're only deported.\" According to Marj\u00e1n and Sapir, the very idea of \"Eurabia\" is \"based on an extremist conspiracy theory, according to which Europe and the Arab states would join forces to make life impossible for Israel and Islamize the old continent.\" Writing in Race & Class in 2006, author and freelance journalist Matt Carr argued that Eurabia had moved from \"an outlandish conspiracy theory\" to a \"dangerous Islamophobic fantasy\". Carr states, Arun Kundnani, writing for the International Centre for Counter-terrorism, notes that \"Eurabia\" fulfills the counter-jihad movement's \"structural need\" for a conspiracy theory, and compares \"Eurabia\" to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, while Carr compares it to the Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory. Doug Saunders argues that pro-Al-Qaeda writers, and those who promote the Eurabia theory as truth, have a common extremism and world view, where \"there is one creature called 'the Muslim' and another called 'the Westerner'\". He proposes that there is no such distinction and that Muslims can become secular in the Western world. ==See also== *Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory *Eurosphere *Great Replacement *Kalergi plan *Londonistan *Race traitor *Racism in Europe *White genocide conspiracy theory ==Notes== ==External links== Category:Words coined in the 2000s Category:Arabization Category:Islamization Category:Euroscepticism Category:Islam-related controversies Category:Political neologisms Category:Islam in Europe Category:Demographics of Europe Category:Anti-Arabism Category:Anti-Islam sentiment Category:Neologisms Category:Political catchphrases Category:Conspiracy theories in Europe Category:Conspiracy theories involving Muslims Category:Far-right politics in Europe Category:Far-right politics in the United States Category:Islamophobia Category:Francophobia Category:White genocide conspiracy theory Category:Fictional locations ",
