    "text": "Lucas Niang (born August 19, 1998) is an American football offensive tackle for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU) and was drafted by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft. ==Early years== Niang grew up in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he became a football star at New Canaan High School. He was born in New York and lived in Geneva, Switzerland from the ages of 4 to 6. His family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut when they returned to the US. Niang started to play football with the Pop Warner league in New Canaan in 3rd grade. Niang also played basketball and tennis growing up. Playing both offensive and defensive line in high school, he helped lead the Rams to state championships in 3 straight seasons from 2013-2015, before committing to play college football at TCU. At New Canaan, Niang was a two time All-FCIAC selection as a Junior and Senior, and during his Senior Season was an All-State First Team Selection, from both the Coaches Association and New Haven Register. ==College career== Niang was highly recruited coming out of high school. He had around 40 scholarship offers from schools including TCU, Penn State, Auburn, Miami, and Georgia, and decided to enroll at TCU. After enrolling at TCU in 2016, Niang played in 12 of the Horned Frogs' 13 games as a true freshman that fall. He became a starter midway through his sophomore season in 2017, helping lead the Frogs to the program's first-ever berth in the Big 12 Championship Game and a win in the 2017 Alamo Bowl over Stanford. Starting all 13 games at right tackle for TCU as a junior in 2018, Niang didn't allow a sack the entire season and earned 2nd Team All-Big 12 honors before helpling lead the Frogs to a win over California in the 2018 Cheez-It Bowl. Prior to his senior season, Niang was named 1st Team Preseason All-Big 12, and The Athletic named him as one of the top offensive linemen in college football. Hall of Fame NFL executive Gil Brandt has named Niang as one of the top offensive line prospects for the 2020 NFL Draft, and ESPN draft expert Todd McShay has projected Niang as a first-round selection and best offensive tackle in the 2020 NFL Draft. Niang was forced to end his senior season early after TCU pulled out an upset win against the University of Texas in late October 2019. He had been advised by his doctor the week before to get surgery to repair a torn hip labrum he had been playing through since the beginning of the season to avoid the risk of a more severe injury. Niang played as a true freshman in 12 games out of 13. He became a starter as a sophomore and in his 28 games and three-year span as a starter for TCU, he never allowed a single sack. Over that period, he only had two holding calls and no false starts. ==Professional career== Niang was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round with the 96th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. On August 6, 2020, he announced he would opt out of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ==External links== *Kansas City Chiefs bio *TCU Horned Frogs bio Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:American football offensive linemen Category:French players of American football Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:People from New Canaan, Connecticut Category:Players of American football from Connecticut Category:Sportspeople from Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:TCU Horned Frogs football players ",
