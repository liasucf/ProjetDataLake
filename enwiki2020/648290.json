    "text": "Lionel Blue (6 February 1930 \u2013 19 December 2016) was a British Reform rabbi, journalist and broadcaster, described by The Guardian as \"one of the most respected religious figures in the UK\". He was best known for his longstanding work with the media, most notably his wry and gentle sense of humour on Thought for the Day on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was the first British rabbi publicly to declare his homosexuality. ==Career== Blue was born in the East End of London in 1930. His parents were Jews of Russian origin and his father worked as a tailor. Blue did not receive a religious education, declaring that he lost his religious faith at the age of five after a petitionary prayer failed to remove Adolf Hitler and Oswald Mosley. Instead, Blue became interested in Marxism. He entered Hendon County School at sixth form level, following education in the East End and a year out of school at age 16\u201317. He served in the British Army but was discharged after suffering a nervous breakdown brought on by anxiety over his closet homosexuality. Blue read History at Balliol College, Oxford and Semitics at University College London. He regained his faith while at Oxford, when he found some resolution to severe personal conflicts regarding his sexual orientation at a Quaker meeting. He also found Victor Gollancz's A Year of Grace helpful during this time, and finally became one of the first two students at Leo Baeck College for training rabbis in 1956.Blue, Lionel (2010) The Godseeker's Guide pps.15, 36 \u2013 40 & 136, Continuum International Publishing Group, Our History \u2013 Rabbi Leigh Edgware & District Reform Synagogue Blue was ordained as a rabbi in 1960.

Blue made his first radio broadcast in 1967 and was a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme for 25 years. He made numerous appearances on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 2 and produced a television programme, entitled In Search of Holy England, in 1989. In 2006, a return trip to his childhood home in London's East End to mark the 350th anniversary of Jewish life in Britain was the subject of an evocative audioslideshow on the BBC News website.

In 1994, he was appointed to an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). ==Personal life== Blue came out in 1980 while he was involved with sailboat designer Christopher \"Kim\" Holman, which lasted from 1962 to 1982.\"The Life and Designs of Kim Holman\" Classic Boat, January 2008; accessed August 20, 2019 He published Godly and Gay in 1981.
