In 1986, Tabakov persuaded his students to form the Tabakov Studio attached to the Moscow Art Theatre. Several notable Russian actors, including Yevgeny Mironov, Sergey Bezrukov, Vladimir Mashkov, Andrey Smolyakov and Alexandre Marine, studied at the studio. Tabakov also worked in numerous foreign countries, spreading his theatre's ideals abroad. ==Film career== Tabakov's movie career paralleled the theatrical. He was featured in Grigori Chukhrai's Clear Skies (1961), Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace (1966\u201367), TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973) and D'Artagnan and Three Musketeers (1978), the Academy Award-winning Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears (1980), Nikita Mikhalkov's Oblomov (1981) and Dark Eyes (1986), and the mock red western A Man from the Boulevard des Capuchines (1987), among others. ==Voice-over work== Tabakov has lent his distinctive, purr-like voice to a number of animated characters, including the talking cat Matroskin in Three from Prostokvashino and its sequels.

In March 2014, he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. In September 2014, Tabakov claimed that Crimea has no relation to Ukraine and upbraided Ukrainians for discussing it: \"But all happened fairly. If our Ukrainian brothers were smarter, they would not discuss that topic. They had to say: \"Forgive us for God's sake! We had encroached the gravy train.\" Because Crimea has no relation to dependent, nor independent Ukraine.\"\u0422\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u00ab\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432-\u0445\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u00bb \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c .
