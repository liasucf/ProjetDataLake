    "text": "The Interdynamics MKR was a Swedish prototype assault rifle developed in the 1980s. The weapon never proceeded beyond prototype stages. ==Design== The Interdynamics MKR was originally designed using a 4.5\u00d726mm MKR round using solid brass bullets. Its purpose was to provide a flat ballistic trajectory along with armor-piercing capabilities with low recoil for the user to handle, even when fired fully automatically. An additional part of the concept was for it to use a low cost ammunition type. The 4.5\u00d726mm MKR round was claimed to be ballistically as effective at 300 meters as the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round. Another interesting feature about the weapon is that it was bullpup in design, which means that the magazine is located behind the trigger, and also utilized the blowback system of operation. The bullpup design was a significant tactical advantage because it increased the firearm's compactness and allowed for a smaller, lighter and more efficient firearm. ==See also== *List of bullpup firearms *List of assault rifles ==References== * Category:Assault rifles of Sweden Category:Trial and research firearms of Sweden Category:Bullpup rifles ",
