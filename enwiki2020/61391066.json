    "text": "K-292 was a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-292's western terminus was at K-92 northeast of the unincorporated community of Springdale and the eastern terminus was at K-92 northeast of Springdale. K-292 was established in 1945 as a state highway, to serve the former covered bridge that crossed Stranger Creek, which was an old alignment of K-92. After the bridge, built in 1858, burned down in 1958, K-292 was removed from the highway system in 1960. ==Route description== K-292 began at K-92 northeast of Springdale. It began travelling southeastward, on what is now 227th Street, through a forested area along Stranger Creek, a tributary of the Kansas River. It then curved northeastward and crossed the creek via the former covered bridge. It continued past the bridge for a short distance before terminating back at K-92. ==History== Former covered bridge, taken June 1958 K-292 was established on December 12, 1945 as a state highway. Its purpose was to serve the old covered bridge that crossed Stranger Creek, which was an old alignment of K-92. After the bridge burned down, K-92 was removed from the highway system in a June 22, 1960 resolution. In 1858, General Albert Sydney Johnston, commander at Fort Leavenworth, had four covered bridges constructed across Stranger Creek. The bridges cost about $1500 each and were constructed at Easton, Farmington, Jarbalo and Springdale. The other three were removed in the 1930s. It was later abandoned for a few years before the State Highway Commission starting a restoration project in 1946, including a new roof and siding. Then on September 21, 1958, the bridge was struck by lightning and burned down. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 292 ",
