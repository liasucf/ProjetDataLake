    "text": "Kill Memory Crash is an Electronic band from Chicago, Illinois. They originally formed around 1998 as a duo (Alex SanFa\u00e7on and Adam Sieczka), and made an almost self-imposed exile from the music industry due to their indifferences to the popular styles of Electronic music at the time. Kill Memory Crash eventually became known for their subversive lyrical themes and dark musical style, blurring the boundaries between industrial, techno, electro, pop, and rock. They signed with Ghostly International in 2002 and released their first full-length album \"American Automatic\" in 2005 (the follow-up to their mini-LP, \"When The Blood Turns Black\"). In 2008 they were joined by live percussionist (and DJ) Gabriel Palomo of Zuvuya Recordings, who was introduced to them through a mutual friend. Kill Memory Crash continues to perform at select international venues/events and is rumored to be working on new material for 2013. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *When The Blood Turns Black \u2013 2002 (Ghostly International) *Crash V8 \u2013 2005 (Ghostly International) *American Automatic \u2013 2005 (Ghostly International) *Of Fire \u2013 2008 (Ghostly International) ===Remixes=== *Never Forget/Technasty RMX \u2013 2004 (Ghostly International/Spectral Sound) *\"List Of Demands (Reparations) (Kill Memory Crash Remix)\" - 2004 (Wichita) *The O \u2013 2005 (Ghostly International/Spectral Sound) *\"Crash V8\" - 2005 (Ghostly International/Spectral Sound) *\"Binary Nation (Demento Mix)\" - 2006 (Invisible, Underground, Inc.) *\"Eyes Like Knives (written by Kill Memory Crash & Franz + Shape)\" - 2007 (Relish Recordings) ===Compilation Appearances=== *Idol Tryouts: Ghostly International Vol. 1 \u2013 2003 (Ghostly International) \u2013 \"Get Out\" *Idol Tryouts: Ghostly International Vol. 2 \u2013 2006 (Ghostly International) \u2013 \"Press + Burn\" *Ghostly Swim \u2013 2008 (Ghostly International/Williams Street Records) \u2013 \"Hit + Run\" ==Members== Alex SanFa\u00e7on - Electronics & Production Adam Killing - Synths & Vocals Gabriel Palomo - Live Percussion ==External links== *Official Website *Official MySpace *Kill Memory Crash at Ghostly International Category:Electronic music groups from Illinois Category:Musical groups from Chicago Category:Underground, Inc. artists Category:Ghostly International artists ",
