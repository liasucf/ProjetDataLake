    "text": "\"Sh\u014dkera\" from the Hyakkai Zukan by Sawaki Suushi \"Sh\u014dkera\" from the Gazu Hyakki Yagy\u014d by Toriyama Sekien The sh\u014dkera (\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3051\u3089) is a Japanese y\u014dkai found in Edo Period y\u014dkai emaki such as the Hyakkai Zukan and the Gazu Hyakki Yagy\u014d. They can also be written \u3057\u3083\u3046\u3051\u3089, \u305b\u3046\u3051\u3089, as well as \u7cbe\u87bb\u86c4.This kanij is seen in publications like Mizuki Shigeru Furusato no Y\u014dkai (\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068\u306e\u5996\u602a) (Jakometei Publications (\u3058\u3083\u3053\u3081\u3066\u3044\u51fa\u7248), 1974), \"Nihon Y\u014dkai Daizen\" (\u65e5\u672c\u5996\u602a\u5927\u5168) (K\u014ddansha, 1991) but in the \"Ketteiban (Authoritative Edition) Nihon Y\u014dkai Daizen\" (\u6c7a\u5b9a\u7248 \u65e5\u672c\u5996\u602a\u5927\u5168) (K\u014ddansha Publications, 2014), the \u7cbe\u87bb\u86c4 kanji could no longer be found. ==Concept== In the Hyakkai Zukan, Gazu Hyakki Yagy\u014d etc., they appear only in pictures with no explanatory text, so what kind of y\u014dkai they are is a matter of speculation. In folk religion, there is a custom called the \"sh\u014dkera\" in the K\u014dshin-Machi where, due to a belief in an insect called Three Corpses inside the body that on the K\u014dshin night would rise to the skies and report that person's crimes to the Ten-Tei (heavenly god) resulting in the Ten-Tei taking that person's life, people would spend the night without sleeping so that the Three Corpses would not leave the body on K\u014dshin night. It is said that those who then proceed to quickly sleep during the day would receive some damage, and it is said that chanting \"Is the sh\u014dkera still in the gut? At my lodging, will I not sleep? Will I sleep? If I don't sleep\" (\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3051\u3089\u306f\u308f\u305f\u3068\u3066\u307e\u305f\u304b\u6211\u5bbf\u3078\u306d\u306c\u305e\u305f\u304b\u305e\u306d\u305f\u304b\u305e\u306d\u306c\u3070, \"sh\u014dkera wa wata tote mata ka waga yado e nenuzotaka zo netaka zo nenuba\") would ward off this harm, so from this, it can be seen that the sh\u014dkera of K\u014dshin-Machi is a y\u014dkai that causes harm to people. Also, in the writing K\u014dshinden (\u5e9a\u7533\u4f1d) from the Genroku years, there is the passage \"sh\u014dkera is an insect, and said in one theory to be the Three Corpses\" (\u30b7\u30e7\u30a6\u30ad\u30e9\u30cf\u866b\u30ce\u30b3\u30c8\u4e5f\u3001\u4e00\u8aac\u4e09\u5c38\u30ce\u30b3\u30c8\u30c8\u4e91), so there is also the interpretation that sh\u014dkera refers to the Three Corpses, and it is also said that they are the personification of the three corpses or that their depiction was modeled after the Three Corpse's middle corpse, which took on the form of a beast. The Gazu Hyakki Yagy\u014d by Toriyama Sekien depicts a sh\u014dkera looking in through the skylight of a house's roof. Y\u014dkai-related literature starting in Sh\u014dwa and Heisei began to give the interpretation that this is surveillance to see whether people are following the rules of K\u014dshin-Machi day, and it is supposed that the sh\u014dkera would give a punishment by three fingers with sharp nails on those who break the rule. ==Notes== ==See also== *List of legendary creatures from Japan Category:Y\u014dkai ",
