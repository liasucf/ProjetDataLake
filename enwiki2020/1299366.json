About 794 Ermengarde married Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, who since 781 ruled as a King of Aquitaine. He had already fathered two children, and Ermengarde may have been his concubine. Ermengarde gave birth to six children: * Lothair I (795\u2013855), born in Altdorf, Bavaria * Pepin I of Aquitaine (797\u2013838) * Adelaide, born ca. 799 * Rotrude, born about 800, married Gerard, Count of Auvergne (c. 800 \u2013 d. 25.6.841) and they had Ranulf I of Poitiers. * Hildegard/Matilda, born c.802, abbess of Notre-Dame in Laon * Louis the German (c.805\u2013876), King of East Francia Charlemagne initially intended to divide his Carolingian Empire between Louis and his brothers Pepin and Charles, who nevertheless died in quick succession in 810/11. On 10 September 813, Charlemagne designated Louis his successor and had him proclaimed co-emperor. Ermengarde's husband became sole emperor and king of the Franks upon his father's death on 28 January 814. The couple was anointed and crowned emperor and empress by Pope Stephen IV on 5 October 816 in Reims Cathedral. She died at Angers, Neustria (in present-day France) on 3 October 818. A few years after her death, her husband remarried to Judith of Bavaria, who bore him Charles the Bald. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:770s births Category:818 deaths Category:Frankish queens consort Category:Holy Roman Empresses Category:Women of the Carolingian Empire Category:8th-century Frankish nobility Category:8th-century Frankish women ",
