    "text": "The Common Support Aircraft (CSA) was a proposed concept, which has been considered by the United States Navy since at least the early 1990s, to replace a number of different fixed-wing aircraft capable of operating from an aircraft carrier and which serve a \"support\" function, with a single type of aircraft or aircraft platform able to perform all support tasks. Current roles deemed \"support\" by the Navy include: carrier on-board delivery (COD), electronic surveillance (ES), electronic warfare (EW), and airborne early warning (AEW). Another possible support role for a carrier-based aircraft is that of aerial refueling. Among combat roles, while anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASUW) are sometimes also considered \"support\"; fighter, bomber, and ground attack roles are not. Current carrier-based fixed- wing support aircraft used by the US Navy, and which would presumably be replaced by the CSA, include: *C-2 Greyhound, for COD *E-2 Hawkeye, for AEW Other support aircraft used by the US Navy in the recent past include: *S-3 Viking, for ASW, ASUW, and recovery tanking *ES-3 Shadow, for ES *EA-6B Prowler, for EW *KA-6D, for mission tanking ==External links== *Common Support Aircraft (CSA) on GlobalSecurity.org *\"Common Support Aircraft(CSA)\" on The Federation of American Scientists(FAS)web-site *Chimera, Wombat/Joey, Crossbow, and Penguin CSA study designs Category:Carrier-based aircraft ",
