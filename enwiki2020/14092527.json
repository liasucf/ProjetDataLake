Later that month, KZSJ began broadcasting with a regional Mexican music format that played genres including banda and ranchera as part of the Z-Spanish Radio Network operated by Redwood City entrepreneur Amador Bustos. Eustis finalized a sale of KZSJ for $450,000 in late January 1996 to Bustos, and KZSJ was granted its first broadcasting license on February 21, 1996. In March 1999, KZSJ entered a local marketing agreement with Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng Inc. and changed to a Vietnamese format. Programming on the Qu\u00ea H\u01b0\u01a1ng radio network has included music, community events, and legal advice geared towards Vietnamese-American communities. By 2003, Bustos moved KZSJ to his Bustos Media company.https://recnet.com/owr/?appid=676503 In July 2003, KZSJ broadcast public service announcements from the San Jose Police Department in Vietnamese expressing condolences to the family of a 25-year-old woman of Vietnamese descent who was fatally shot at her home by officers who thought the woman was carrying a weapon, which turned out to be a vegetable peeler.
