There his talents began to be recognized and he was admitted to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1849. In 1850 he began working and studying with a well-known sculptor James Pradier. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet Following Pradier's death in 1852 Chapu began studying with another sculptor, Francisque Duret. After coming in second in 1851, he won the Prix de Rome in 1855, then spent five years in Italy. His statues Mercury of 1861 and Jeanne d'Arc of 1870 (in which she was represented as a peasant girl) were his first big successes, and led to many commissions thereafter. He is also known for his medals, and led the French revival in the medal as an artistic form.
