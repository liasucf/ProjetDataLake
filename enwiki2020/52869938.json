The company produces and exports seed drills, cultivators, fertiliser spreaders and other farming equipment around the world. In 2001, Aitchison and his wife, Sylvia, retired to the Wellington suburb of Roseneath. In 2015, the couple made national headlines after their neighbour built a four-metre high fence blocking their view of Wellington harbour. After a legal battle, the Environment Court ordered the fence be removed in January 2016. ==References== Category:1930s births Category:Living people Category:Rowers from Whanganui Category:New Zealand male rowers Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for New Zealand Category:Rowers at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Category:20th-century New Zealand businesspeople Category:20th-century New Zealand engineers ",
