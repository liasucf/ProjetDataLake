Together with Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (1883\u20131962), he was the most prominent of Yugoslav sculptors of his day. ==Biography== Rosandi\u0107 was born in the Dalmatian city of Split, Austria-Hungary, the son of a stoneworker. His family name, Rosandi\u0107 originates from Podgora a small coastal village in Southern Dalmatia about 70 km south of Split. During the early years in Split, Rosandi\u0107 learnt to carve in wood as well as stone and was much inspired by the younger Me\u0161trovi\u0107 who had moved there from Otavice. Both sculptors studied overseas before returning to Split, Rosandi\u0107 touring Italy and exhibiting in Milan in 1906 and Belgrade in 1912. Something of their parallel development and underlying rivalry can be understood from their respective projects to combine sculpture and architecture. Both constructed a mausoleum, Rosandi\u0107 for the Petrinovi\u0107 family (Supetar, on the island of Bra\u010d off Split) and Me\u0161trovi\u0107 to the Ra\u010di\u0107 family (Cavtat, south of Dubrovnik). Each exhibit the influence of Dalmatian history, but while Me\u0161trovi\u0107's mausoleum is based on the principle of simplicity, Rosandi\u0107 richly ornamented his building with a blend of Gothic and Renaissance motifs to express a more national character. Statue of Stone Thrower (1935), National Museum of Serbia With the outbreak of World War I, Rosandi\u0107 left for London where he exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in 1917 and later in Brighton and Edinburgh. During World War II, Rosandi\u0107 settled in Belgrade. He was interned by the German occupation forces during the war, but was later released through the intervention of Dragomir Jovanovi\u0107. Rosandi\u0107 later testified at the Belgrade Process. Rosandi\u0107 was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948. He founded a prominent school in Belgrade known as the \"Master Workshop\". Amongst the many artists and public personalities that frequented the workshop was Henry Moore, during his exhibition in Belgrade in March 1955. In his maturity, Rosandi\u0107 executed two of his greatest masterpieces: the pair of stone statues of a man struggling with a horse, which flank the entrance to the Federal Parliament building in Belgrade (today Parliament of Serbia), and a massive stone frieze of figures for a monument in Subotica, Vojvodina, Serbia (1952). Many of his bronze projects at this time were cast in the Vo\u017edovac foundry and other works by his hand can be found at the Toma Rosandi\u0107 Memorial Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade. Rosandi\u0107 returned to Split before his death in 1958. ==External links== * Biography (Croatian) * Biography and works * Rosandi\u0107 among Croatia famous natives Category:19th-century Croatian sculptors Category:20th-century Croatian sculptors Category:1878 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Croatian sculptors Category:Serbian sculptors Category:Male sculptors Category:Yugoslav sculptors Category:People from Split, Croatia Category:People from the Kingdom of Dalmatia Category:20th-century sculptors Category:19th-century Croatian people Category:20th-century Croatian people Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts ",
