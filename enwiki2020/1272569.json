Bi\u00f1an also known as Biniang has become both a suburban residential community of Metro Manila and a location for some of the Philippines' largest industrial estates and export processing zones. Prior to its cityhood in 2010, Bi\u00f1an was the richest municipality in the Philippines with an annual gross income of \u20b1677 million (US$14.383 million) and net income of \u20b1250 million (US$5.308 million), as of 2007 by the Commission On Audit.

By virtue of Republic Act 10658, signed on March 27, 2015, by President Benigno Aquino III, Bi\u00f1an has been separated from the First Congressional District of Laguna and formed the Lone Congressional District of Bi\u00f1an. The first representative, the former mayor of the city, has been elected during the 2016 elections, unopposed. ==Etymology== Where Bi\u00f1an got its name is a mystery. Some deduced that before Captain Juan de Salcedo proceeded to Cainta and Taytay finally reaching Bay, he landed in Bi\u00f1an. According to the story, Padres Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar planted a huge wooden cross on the spot where the present day San Isidro Labrador parish stands and co- celebrated a Thanksgiving Mass. Curious natives gathered and the two Spanish missionaries took advantage of the situation. They baptized each one of them. From then on, old folks say they called the place \u201cBinyagan,\u201d which means a baptismal place. The Spanish tongue's difficulty in pronouncing the local dialect acquired for the once town its name\u2014 \"Bi\u00f1an\". ==History== Captain Juan de Salcedo discovered and founded Bi\u00f1an at the end of June 1571, a month after Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi established Manila when he explored the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines and second in Asia (Laguna de Bay). When the seat of the provincial government of the Provincia de la Laguna de Bay was moved from Bay to Pagsanjan in 1688, Bi\u00f1an separated from Tabuco (now the city of Cabuyao). In 1791, during the time of Pablo Faustino, Santa Rosa separated from Bi\u00f1an. The following year, January 15 Sta Rosa de Lima was established and became an independent town. Historically, Bi\u00f1an is nationally recognized in the books related to the biography of Jos\u00e9 Rizal, the country's national hero. It was in June 1869 when Jos\u00e9 Rizal as a young boy went to Bi\u00f1an with his brother Paciano. They proceeded to his aunt's house near the town proper where they were to be lodged. Here, his first formal education was entrusted to Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz who after a year and a half of tutelage advised young Rizal to continue higher education in Manila. In honor of Jos\u00e9 Rizal, a plaque of recognition was bestowed on the house where he stayed at. A monument now stands at the center of Bi\u00f1an's plaza in recognition of Bi\u00f1an's affiliation to Rizal. ===Cityhood=== On February 2, 2010, by the virtue of the Republic Act 9740, Bi\u00f1an became a component city after its voters accepted the ratification in the plebiscite.

In 2009, the National Cultural Heritage Act was signed into law, by the NHCP, stating that structures at least 50 years old are to receive special protection from the government. The Alberto house is more than 200 years old. According to the law, such buildings cannot be demolished without a permit from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts or NHCP. As national cultural treasures, they are entitled to privileges such as \"priority government funding for protection, conservation and restoration.\" Also stated on the law, there should be a Conservation Incentive Program that encourages private individuals to restore and maintain such structures. The law further commands that an official heritage marker be placed by the cultural agency concerned to indicate that the immovable cultural property has been identified as a national historical site. Bi\u00f1an is historically known as the place where Jos\u00e9 Rizal received his first formal education. He was about eight years old when he and his brother, Paciano left Calamba and settled in Bi\u00f1an. There, he used to reside in his mother's ancestral home, owned by the family of Jose Alberto Alonzo, the father of Rizal's mother, Teodora Alonzo. The Alberto Mansion, built in the early 19th century, is a two-storey house with a floor area of about 600 square meters and is currently located at the Poblacion across from the city government building. The property has been passed down to his heir, Gerardo Alberto. The city government of Bi\u00f1an aimed to declare the Alberto Mansion a heritage site. The city council had approved the release of Php 20 million (about US$482,000.00) for the purchase of the 2,000-square- meter property, but Gerardo Alberto declined the offer and sold the 200-year- old mansion to Gerry Acuzar, owner of Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar, a heritage resort in Bagac, Bataan. Much of the house's interior had been dismantled and brought to Bataan, where Acuzar is rebuilding it, using the doors, pillars and other appurtenances from the original structure. Then on October 22, 2012, the house collapsed from its roof. The residents suspect that the dismantling of the interior of the house (without a demolition permit from the city government), might have caused the collapse of the roof. The partial collapse of the mansion became a huge call to the Bi\u00f1an government for the Alberto Mansion's expropriation. Heritage advocates led by the United Artists for Cultural Conservation and Development, City of Bi\u00f1an Inc. (UACCD), the municipal government of Bi\u00f1an, and its residents believe that only the current Philippine President can turn the tide. He can empower the National Historical Commission of the Philippines to restore and repair the house. ===Sentrong Pangkultura ng Bi\u00f1an=== The Sentrong Pangkultura ng Bi\u00f1an (Bi\u00f1an Center for Culture and Arts, or the Bi\u00f1an old Municipal Building) houses the Bi\u00f1an City Museum and the Bi\u00f1an City Studies Center (Bi\u00f1an City Archives). The building also the home of the Bi\u00f1an Center for Performing Arts, which includes the following art groups: Bi\u00f1an Metropolitan Chorus (chorale), Bi\u00f1an Youth Performance Council (theater arts), Bi\u00f1an Folkloric Dance Troupe (traditional dances) and Bi\u00f1an Kawayan Music Ensemble (bamboo instrumentalists).

Rizal received his first formal schooling in Bi\u00f1an under the tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz.

On August 1, 2016, the City Government of Bi\u00f1an opened the School of Rizal Site and Museum to the public after its acquisition from the Gonzales Family in 2015. ===Araw ng Bi\u00f1an=== The three-day Araw ng Bi\u00f1an, commemorates the cityhood anniversary (February 2), Bi\u00f1an's liberation day from the Japanese Imperial Forces (February 3), and the remembrance of the founding anniversary of Bi\u00f1an (February 5). ===Bi\u00f1an Puto Latik Festival=== Happening every first week of February since 2011, the Puto Latik Festival is to commemorate the Puto Bi\u00f1an, which is Bi\u00f1an's rice cake delicacy, and the Maglalatik traditional dance that originated from Bi\u00f1an. However, beginning 2017, it shall be celebrated every May 15\u201323, because of the Maglalatik's historical significance to the celebration of San Isidro Labrador's feast day, the city's patron saint. ==Transportation== The city is accessible to all types of land transportation via South Luzon Expressway through Greenfield City (Mamplasan), Southwoods, and Carmona exits.
