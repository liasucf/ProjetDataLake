    "text": "N\u00f3r (Old Norse N\u00f3rr) is according to the Orkneyinga Saga the eponymous founder of Norway. ==Icelandic accounts== ===Source material=== N\u00f3r of Norway appear in \u201cFundinn N\u00f3regr\u201d (\u2018Norway Founded\u2019), hereafter called F, which begins the Orkneyinga saga, and in Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist (\u2018How Norway was Settled\u2019), hereafter called B, both found in the Flatey Book. The term is described differently in different sources.https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nor ===About Thorri=== King Thorri (\u00deorri 'frozen snow') was son of Sn\u00e6r ('Snow') the Old, a descendant of Fornj\u00f3t (\"king of Jotlandi (also spelled GotlandiSee second line: http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Fundinn_Noregr), later known as Quennlandi and Finnlandi\"). See Sn\u00e6r and Fornj\u00f3t for further information. The name \u00deorri has long been connected with that of \u00de\u00f3rr, the name of the Norse thunder god Thor, or thunder personified.Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Franz Joseph Mone, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten V\u00f6lker, besonders der Griechen, Heyer und Leske, 1822, p. 275. A grandson of King Snow, and Frost before that, king N\u00f3r marries Hedda (H\u00f6ddu) daughter of Sva\u00f0a J\u00f3tun that may be seen as descending from the Scyldings, from the Kings of Lejre, the stronghold of the descendants of Dan in Denmark. \u00deorri is the sister of Driva, mother of Visbur, as attested by the scolding poetic genealogy known as Ynglingatal, by King Vanlande (from the land of the Wends), as well as F\u00f3nn and Mj\u00f3l, by their father Snow the Old (Sn\u00e6r ins Gamli) - who lived for 360 years. He was an offspring of Frost (Frosti), child of K\u00e1ri (master of the arctic wind), sibling to Logi (master of the fire - eponymous to H\u00e5logaland - High Logi), & Hler (master of the sea, called \u00c6gir, and cognate with Llyr as well as King Lear of Shakespeare, as well as eponymous to Lejre and L\u00e6s\u00f8). ==Chronicon Lethrens'== The Chronicle of Lejre (\u201cChronicon Lethrense\u201d) written about 1170 introduces a primeval King Ypper of Uppsala whose three sons were Dan who afterwards ruled Denmark, Nori who afterwards ruled Norway, and \u00d6sten who afterwards ruled the Swedes. But the account then speaks only of the descendants of Dan. Although not matching, there are some correspondences between the sources. In the B-source (Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist) N\u00f3r is married H\u00f6ddu, granddaughter of a King \u00d6sten, on her mother \u00c5shild's side. Her and her brother Hrolf of Berg's father, Sva\u00f0a J\u00f3tun appears in a number of obscure genealogies as a descendant from Dan, through Hj\u00f6rvard Halgison, also named \u00c5sathor O\u00f0innson who married Helga Fri\u00f0leifsson; Fri\u00f0leif was born to Fr\u00f3\u00f0i King of Denmark, descendants of Scj\u00f6ldr, eponymous anchestor of the Scyldings. Both accounts state that great sacrifice was made yearly at mid-winter, whence was derived both the name of the mid-winter sacrifice and the name of the winter month Thorri corresponding to late January and early February in the Roman calendar. ===The story of N\u00f3r=== One year, at the time of Thorri's Sacrifice, G\u00f3i the daughter of King Thorri suddenly vanished. Thorri held a second feast the following month hoping to learn what had become of G\u00f3i. That sacrifice was afterward also observed regularly and known as G\u00f3i's Sacrifice and the name of the month was thence named G\u00f3i. When G\u00f3i was still not found after three years, her brothers N\u00f3r and G\u00f3r set out separately in search of her with many folk in their following, N\u00f3r and his folk going by land on skis while G\u00f3r went by ship and searched the islands and skerries. Eventually N\u00f3r and his following came to the Kj\u00f6len Mountains (the Keel) and passed into was later to be called Norway, defeating any who opposed him. F relates in particular that N\u00f3r defeated the folk around what was later called the Trondheimsfjord, that N\u00f3r also took possession of the eastern lands near Lake Mjors (modern lake Mj\u00f8sa), then slew King Sokni, the eponym of Sokna Dale (modern Sogndal) and Sognefj\u00f6rd (modern Sognefjorden) and took possession of his kingdom. But B mentions instead the defeat of four kings named V\u00e9i, Vei, Hunding (Hundingr), and Heming (Hemingr). Then, in Heidemark (approximately the modern region of Hedemarken in the more extensive province of Hedmark), N\u00f3r met with King Hr\u00f3lf of the Hill (Hr\u00f3lfr \u00ed Bergr). Hr\u00f3lf was son of the giant Svadi (Sva\u00f0i) from Dovre Mountain in the north. According to B Hr\u00f3lf's mother was \u00c1shild (\u00c1shildr) daughter of King Eystein of Heidemark. It was this Hr\u00f3lf who had taken G\u00f3i captive and had then made her his wife. N\u00f3r and Hr\u00f3lf came to terms (after a long single combat according to F). Hr\u00f3lf kept G\u00f3i as his wife and N\u00f3r afterwards married Hr\u00f3lf's sister (called H\u00f6dd in B) and became N\u00f3r's man. Both accounts relate that G\u00f3r eventually joined N\u00f3r and the two brothers made an agreement that N\u00f3r would rule all the mainland but G\u00f3r would rule all islands around the mainland, that he would be lord over any island that was separated from the mainland by a channel through which a ship with a fixed rudder was able to pass. The mainland was then named Norway (Noregr) after N\u00f3r. N\u00f3r's new kingdom is now said to have been what is south-eastern Norway today, as it extended from J\u00f6tunheim mountains in the north to what was later known as \u00c1lfheim (roughly the modern Swedish Bohusl\u00e4n) in the south, the southern border of N\u00f3r's land being what is now the Glomma river whose southwestern course is not very far inside the southeastern border of modern Norway. The sons and grandsons and later descendants of N\u00f3r continually divided their inheritances among themselves so that Norway became filled with many small kingdoms and lordships. ===Descendants of N\u00f3r=== According to B, N\u00f3r's sons by H\u00f6dd were Thr\u00e1nd (\u00der\u00e1ndr) and Gard (Gar\u00f0r). B later brings in another son of N\u00f3r named Raum (Raumr). Presumably either Raum had another mother than H\u00f6dd or Raum's name has accidentally dropped out from the earlier listing of H\u00f6dd's sons. ====Thr\u00e1nd==== Thr\u00e1nd ruled Trondheim (\u00der\u00e1ndheimr) which was named after him and refers approximately to present day county of S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag and the southern parts of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, rather than to the city now called Trondheim. Eireks saga v\u00ed\u00f0f\u00f6rla ('The Saga of Eirek the Traveller') also brings in Thrand as the first king to regin of Trondheim. Thrand's ancestry is not given here, but he is the father of Eirek the Traveller (Eirekr inn v\u00ed\u00f0f\u01ebrli) the hero of the saga. H\u00e1lfdanar saga Eysteinssonar ('Saga of Halfdan Eystein's son') states instead that Trondheim was named from King Thr\u00e1nd, the father of Eirek the Traveller, but also states that Thrand was son of King S\u00e6mingr of H\u00e1logaland, son of Odin, and that Thr\u00e1nd's mother and S\u00e6mingr's wife was Nauma after whom Naumu Dale was named. For more on S\u00e6mingr see Sons of Odin. Thrand's wife is here said to be Dagm\u00e6r sister of Svanhv\u00edt the wife of Hr\u00f3mund Grip's son, the protagonist of Hr\u00f3mundar saga Gripssonar. The saga says that Eystein, son of Thrand and Dagm\u00e6r, married \u00c1sa, a daughter of Sigurd Hart (the maternal grandfather of Harald Fairhair), and she bore him Halfdan, the hero of the saga. This places Thrand just three generations back from Harald Fairhair. But this saga seems to be a late and untraditional creation, dating only to the early 14th century. ====Gard==== Gard son of N\u00f3r was also called Gard Agdi (Gar\u00f0r Ag\u00f0i), apparently as ruler of Agdir (Ag\u00f0ir): the modern counties of Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder. Gard Agdi's descendants ruled the southwestern regions of Norway. See Gard Agdi for details. ====Raum the Old==== Raum inherited south-eastern Norway and also the northwestern valley of the Rauma river to the western sea which waters the region called Raums Dale (modern Romsdal). Raum in this account also ruled the land of \u00c1lfheim to the south. See Raum the Old for further details on Raum and his descendants. ===Descendants of G\u00f3r=== G\u00f3r had sons named Heiti and Beiti (and according to B two other sons named Meitir and Geitir). Heiti and Beiti often made war against the sons of N\u00f3r. Beiti the sea-king had one of his ships put on sledge runners and so passed in the ship over the snow-covered land starting from what was afterwards called Beitstad on Beitstadfjorden from Beiti's named and passing north across Ellid\u00e6id (Elli\u00f0\u00e6i\u00f0 'Galley-neck') to Naumu Dale (Naumudal) with his father G\u00f3r in the ship with his hand on the tiller. So, by the agreement that had been made between N\u00f3r and G\u00f3r, the land between the path of the ship and the sea became Beiti's. The names of Beiti's descendants are missing from B. Heiti the sea-king was the father of Svadi (Sva\u00f0i). Geitir was father of Glammi and Gylfi; and Meitir the sea-king was father of two sons named M\u00e6vil and Myndil (Myndill), Myndil being father of two sons named Ekkil (Ekkill) and Skekkil (Skekkill). But F speaks only of G\u00f3r's son Heiti as the father of Sveidi (Svei\u00f0i) the father of Halfdan the Old, who confusingly is named identically to Halfdan the Old who is a descendant of N\u00f3r. But it is from Halfdan the Old who is called a descendant of G\u00f3r from whom springs at last the Jarls of Orkney who are the subject of the Orkneyinga saga. See Halfdan the Old to follow this lineage further. ==Alternative spellings== Alternative Anglicizations are: * Gl\u00f3i: Gloi * G\u00f3r: Gorr * Hr\u00f3lf: Hrolf, Rolf * N\u00f3r: Norr * Forniot, Forniotr * Hl\u00e9r: Hler ; : Kari * Sn\u00e6r: Snaer, Sn\u0153r, Snow * V\u00e9i: Vee. == References == Category:Medieval Norway Category:Kings in Norse mythology and legends ",
