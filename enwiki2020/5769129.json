    "text": "Sonnet 45 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Sonnet 45 is continued from Sonnet 44. ==Structure== Sonnet 45 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The Shakespearean sonnet contains three quatrains followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in a type of poetic metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The final line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / I send them back again, and straight grow sad. (45.14) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = nonictus. The meter demands several contractions: one-syllable \"being\" in line 7 and \"even\" in line 11, and \u2014 somewhat controversially \u2014 a three-syllable \"melancholy\" (probably pronounced mel-an-ch'ly) in line 8.Atkins 2007, pp 131\u201332. ==Recordings== *Paul Kelly, for the 2016 album, Seven Sonnets & a Song ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Analysis Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ",
