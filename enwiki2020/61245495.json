    "text": "This page concerns what information has been gathered on Illyrian vocabulary. No Illyrian texts survive, so sources for identifying Illyrian words have been identified by Hans Krahe. as being of four kinds: inscriptions, glosses of Illyrian words in classical texts, names\u2014including proper names (mostly inscribed on tombstones), toponyms and river names\u2014and Illyrian loanwords in other languages. The last category has proven particularly contentious. The names occur in sources that range over more than a millennium, including numismatic evidence, as well as posited original forms of placenames. The Messapian language, which may or may not be related, does have a small attested corpus, but it is not in this page's scope due to the uncertainty about its relationship to Illyrian. ==Proposed Illyrian etyma== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !! attestation !!

Other Illyrians such as Niken, son of Agron, Tritus, son of Plator, or Genthius, are found on graves belonging to ordinary families (fig.7).\" The following anthroponyms derive from Illyrian or are not yet connected with another language unless noted, such as the Delmatae names of Liburnian origin. Alf\u00f6ldy identified five principal onomastic provinces within the Illyrian area: 1) the \"real\" Illyrians south of the river Neretva in Dalmatia and extending south to Epirus; 2) the Delmatae, who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the \"real Illyrians\" to the south and the Liburni to the north; 3) the Liburni, a branch of Venetic in the northeast Adriatic; 4) the Iapodes, who dwelt north of the Delmatae and behind (inland from) the coastal Liburnians; 5) the Pannonians in the northern lands, and in Bosnia, northern Montenegro and Western Serbia. Kati\u010di\u0107 does not recognize a separate Pannonian onomastic area, and includes the Pannoni with the Delmatae.. Below, names from four of Alf\u00f6ldy's five onomastic areas are listed, Liburnian excluded, having been identified as being akin to Venetic. A Dardanian area is also detailed.: \"Thus it seems generally agreed that the name of the Illyrian queen Teuta of the third century BC derives from teutana, which means 'queen'.\": \"The names Daza, Dasius and Dazomenus have been connected with Dasmenus in Pannonia and Dazos in southern Italy. The meaning of these plausible correspondences is hard to determine: neither the internal links between the three principal Illyrian onomastic provinces nor those between them and other areas indicate more than that the languages spoken by peoples in the Illyrian territories were somehow related if not altogether common.\": \"The fourth of the Venetic-speaking peoples around the head of the Adriatic were the Liburni, who occupied the coast and islands between Istria and the river Titus (Krka) and had been known to the Greeks since at least the eighth century BC.\" ===South Illyrian=== *Agirrus *Agron *Andena (f., attested at Dyrrhachium), Andes, Andis, Andio, Andia *Annaeus/Annaius *Antis (f.) *Ballaios *Bardyllis *Bato, may derive from same root as Latin battuere, \"to strike\", or the root *bha, \"say, tell\".: \"The common name Bato may derive from the same root as the Latin battuere meaning `to strike', or is just as likely to derive from the root *bha 'say' or 'tell', the Latin fari.\" *Birkenna *Blodus, Bledis *Boiken *Boria, Bora *Breigos *Brykos *Cleitus/Kleitos (from Greek) *Daors *Dasius *Dazaios, Dazas, Dazos *Ditus *Epe(n)tinus (attested at Dyrrhachium; the name is adjectival, meaning \"from Epetium\", a town now known as Strobe\u010d) *Epicadus *Epidius *Genthena, Genthios, Gentius *Glaukias (from Greek) *Glavus *Grabos *Laiscus *Madena *Messor *Monunius *Mytilus *Pinnes *Pleuratus *Pladomenus *Plare(n)s *Plator (in Liburnian as Plaetor; Venetic Plaetorius, cp. Latin Plaetorius) *Posantio *Pravaius *Scerdis *Skerdilaidas *Tatta *Temus, Temeia *Teuda *Teuta, Teutana means Queen in Illyrian. *Tito, Titus (also the Illyrian name of the river Krka) *Vendes *Verzo *Zanatis *Ziraeus ===Delmatae=== Hundreds of Delmatae names have been recorded. Characteristic names include: *Andena, Andes, Andis, Andio, Andia *Aplis, Apludus, Aplus, Aplius *Apurus *Baezo *Beusas, Beuzas *Curbania *Cursulavia *Iato *Lavincia *Ledrus *Messor *Paio, Paiio *Panes, Panias, Panius (or Pantus, inscription unclear), Panentius *Pant(h)ia/Panto (f.) *Pinsus *Pladomenus *Platino *Samuntio *Seio, Seiio *Statanius, Staticus, Stato, Status *Sestus, Sextus, Sexto *Tito *Tizius *Tritus *Var(r)o Delmatae names in common with the Pannoni (some also occur among the south Illyrians): *Bardurius. *Bato *Carius *Dasantilla *Dasas, Dazas *Dasto *Plator, Platino *Scenobarbus, Scenobardos (?) *Verzo *Verzulus Some Delmatae names probably originate from the Liburnians. This conclusion is based on the Liburnian suffixes: -icus, -ica, -ocus, -ico; and from the distribution of the names among the Liburni/Veneti, and from their absence or scarcity in other onomastic areas: *Acenica *Clevata *Darmocus *Germanicus (the native Delmatae stem Germanus, Germus, with the Venetic/Liburnian -icus suffix) *Labrico *Lunnicus *Melandrica *Turus From the southern Illyrians, the names Boria, Epicadus, Laedicalius, Loiscus, Pinnes and Tato and some others are present. From the Iapodes, Diteio and Ve(n)do, and a few names of Celtic origin (not shown here). ===Pannoni=== Some names attested among the Pannoni: *Bato (also common among the Delmatae) *Dasas, Dasius (also common among the Delmatae) *Scenobarbus (also common among the Delmatae) *Carvus *Laidus *Liccaius *Plator *Temans *Tueta *Varro *Verzo The following names are confined to the Pannonian onomastic province: *Arbo *Arsa (possibly Thracian) *Callo *Daetor *Iauletis (genitive) *Pirusta *Proradus *Scirto *Vietis (genitive) Northern Pannoni: *Bato *Breucus *Dases *Dasmenus *Licco *Liccaius Names attested among the Colapiani, an Illyric tribe of Pannonia: *Bato *Cralus *Liccaius *Lirus *Plassarus Among the Jasi: Scenus. The Breuci: Scilus Bato (first and last name), Blaedarus, Dasmenus, Dasius, Surco, Sassaius, Liccaius, Lensus. The Amantini, the Scordisci: Terco, Precio, Dases, Dasmenus. ===Messapic=== *Dasius, Latin form of a Messapic name from southern Italy.: \"1 Dasius: The Latin form of a Messapic name from southern Italy...\" ===Illyrian theonyms=== The following names of gods (theonyms) derive from possibly several languages (Liburnian, Illyrian, etc.) and are names of gods worshipped by the Illyrians. However, they are known through Interpretatio romana and their names may have been corrupted.: \"Illyrian deities are named on monuments of the Roman era, some in equation with gods of the classical pantheon. ... Thus several deities occur only in Istria, including Eia, Malesocus, Boria and Iria. Anzotica was the Liburnian Venus and appears in the traditional image of the classical goddess. Other local deities were Latra, Sentona and the nymph Ica, worshipped in eastern Istria at a spring still known by praying in relief sculpture, Knez 1974 (ritual vessel), Ba\u00e7e 1984 (temple architecture in Illyrian Albania).\" *Anzotica *Armatus: \"Sometimes the name of a local deity is recorded only in the Latin form, for example, Armatus at Delminium (Duvno) who was evidently a war god of the Delmatae, and the Latin Liber who appears with the attributes of Silvanus and Terminus...\" *Bindus: \"Continuity in a local tradition of engraved ornament is to be seen on other monuments of the Roman period, including altars dedicated by chiefs of the Japodes at the shrine of Bindus Neptunus at a spring near Bihac (see figure 30).\" *Boria *Eia *Ica *Iria *Latra *Malesocus *Medaurus: \"The Illyrian town Rhizon (Risinium) on the Gulf of Kotor had its protective deity Medaurus...\" *Sentona *Thana: \"North of the Japodes, the altars to Vidasus and Thana dedicated at the hot springs of Topu\u0161ko...\" *Vidasus ==External influences== The Ancient Greek language would have become an important external influence on Illyrian-speakers who occupied lands adjacent to ancient Greek colonies, mainly on the Adriatic coast.; . The Taulantii and the Bylliones had, according to Strabo, become bilingual. Invading Celts who settled on lands occupied by Illyrians brought the Illyrians into contact with the Celtic languages and some tribes were Celticized especially those in Dalmatia.. and the Pannoni.. Intensive contact may have happened in what is now Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia. Due to this intensive contact, and because of conflicting classical sources, it is unclear whether some ancient tribes were Illyrian or Celtic (ex: Scordisci). or mixed in varying degree. Thracians and Paeonians also occupied lands populated by Illyrians, bringing Illyrians into contact with the Thracian language and Paeonian language. Certainly, no serious linguistic study of Illyrian language could be made without the inclusion of Latin, in addition to ancient Greek, Thracian and Celtic languages, as the peoples that spoke those languages were recorded by both ancient and modern historians to have lived in lands inhabited by Illyrians at one period of time in history or another. Last, but certainly not least, any comprehensive study of Illyrian language must take into account the Indo-European glossary.Adzanela (Axhanela) Ardian, Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/2490281/Illyrian_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina- an_Overview_of_a_Cultural_Legacy_Ancient_Illyrians_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina ===Celtic=== The following Illyrian names derive from Celtic: *Aioia *Ammida (questionable) *Andetia *Argurianus (Thracian or Celtic) *Arvus *Baeta *Belzeius *Bidna *Boio *Bricussa *Cambrius *Catta *Dussona *Enena *Iaca *Iacus *Iaritus *Kabaletus *Lautus *Litus *Madusa *Madussa *Mallaius *Mascelio *Matera (questionable) *Matisa *Mellito (Greek and Celtic) *Nantanius *Nantia *Nindia *Nonntio *Pinenta (possible) *Poia *Sarnus *Seius *Seneca (questionable) *Sicu *Sinus *Sisimbrius *Totia *Vepus ===Thracian=== The following names derive from Thracian: *Argurianus (Thracian or Celtic) *Auluporis *Auluzon *Bessus *Bithus *Celsinus *Celsus *Cocaius *Daizo *Delus *Dida *Dinentilla *Dizas *Dizo *Dolens *Eptaikenthos *Ettela *Mania *Moca *Murco *Mucatralis *Mucatus *Teres *Torcula *Tzitzis ===Greek=== The following names may derive from Greek: *Ardiaioi, the ancient Greek name for Ardiaei (ardis, 'head of the arrow, sting'). One challenge to this theory is that the suggested root-word ardis does not necessarily form 'Ardiaioi', by the rules of Greek language. *Ceraunii, tribal exonym, (\"\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, \"Thunderbolt-men)\": \"Ceraunii whose name deriving from the Greek for 'thunderbolt' links them with high mountains...\" *Cleitus, (\"\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\", \"renowned man\") *Glaukias, (\"\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\", \"gleaming man\") *Illyrians, gr. , tribal exonym *Mellito, Greek and Celtic element, gr. , \"like honey\" *Plator, gr. , \"wide man\" *Pleuratus, gr. , \"side'\" ===Latin=== The following names may derive from Latin: *Ardiaei, (ardea, 'heron'). However, the problem with the theory supporting the Latin etymology for the Ardiaei is that Ardiaioi, a Greek form of Ardiaei is found in several pre-Roman sources, and it turns that it precedes the Roman/Latin Influence, as it precedes the Vardaei, another form of this name. Greek historian Strabo says in paragraph 6 (Book 7, chapter 5) of his Geographica: \u201cThe Ardiaei were called by the men of later times \"Vardiaei\". ==References== Category:Illyrian languages ",
