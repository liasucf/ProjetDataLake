    "text": "Se\u00f1or Smoke (2005) is the second album from Electric Six, following Fire in 2003. It was released in the UK February 14, 2005 by Warner Music imprint Rushmore Records. Due to complications with Electric Six's former record label, Rushmore did not release the album in North America. In December 2005, the band announced a new partnership with Metropolis Records that resulted in Se\u00f1or Smoke's North American release on February 7, 2006. Se\u00f1or Smoke was ravaged by the UK press upon its 2005 release. However, the response to the album has been much more enthusiastic in America, with several positive reviews, including one from the March 2006 issue of Blender Magazine that claims that the album (which received four stars) is so good that \"[it] achieves an advance modern medicine has long pursued: it restores virginity.\" ==Track listing== All lyrics written by Tyler Spencer except \"Radio Ga Ga\" by Roger Taylor; all music composed by Tyler Spencer except where noted. #\"Rock and Roll Evacuation\" (3:36) #\"Devil Nights\" (Spencer/Zach Shipps/Christopher Tait/Chris Peters) (2:56) #\"Bite Me\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (3:57) #\"Jimmy Carter\" (3:27) #\"Pleasing Interlude I\" (0:47) #\"Dance Epidemic\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (2:48) #\"Future Boys\" (3:08) #\"Dance-A-Thon 2005\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (3:29) #\"Dark Angel\" (3:17) #\"Vibrator\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (2:31) #\"Boy Or Girl?\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (3:26) #\"Pleasing Interlude II\" (0:27) #\"Radio Ga Ga\" (Taylor) (3:55) #\"Taxi to Nowhere\" (1:39) #\"Future Is in the Future\" (Spencer/Shipps/Tait/Peters) (3:37) ==Personnel== * Dick Valentine - vocals * - lead guitar * The Colonel - rhythm guitar * Tait Nucleus? - synthesizer * John R.
