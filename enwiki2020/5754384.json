    "text": "\"Shout\" is a song by English pop/rock band Tears for Fears, released as the second single from their second studio album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985), on 19 November 1984. Roland Orzabal performs lead vocals on the track. The single became the group's sixth UK top 40 hit, peaking at No. 4 in January 1985. In the US, it reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 3 August 1985 and remained there for three weeks. \"Shout\" would become one of the most successful songs of 1985, eventually reaching number 1 in multiple countries. It is regarded as one of the most recognizable songs from the mid-eighties, and is recognized by Chris True of AllMusic as a \"Tears for Fears signature moment\". ==Background== While Tears for Fears' previous single \"Mothers Talk\" had showcased a new, more extroverted songwriting style, \"Shout\" was completed with power chords, heavy percussion, a synth bass solo and a vocal-sounding synth riff. The song even features a lengthy guitar solo, something previously unheard of in Tears for Fears' usual music style. ==Meaning== ==Song versions== \"Shout\" is by far the most abundantly remixed song in the Tears for Fears catalog, with at least 15 different versions of it having been officially released under the band's name. As was commonplace during the 1980s, the original 12-inch vinyl single release featured an extended remix of the song. Three remixes by collaborators Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero later appeared on American releases of the single, including dub and a cappella versions. In addition to the 12-inch mixes, \"Shout\" also appeared in three different 7-inch versions. The original single version released in the UK and much of the rest of the world clocks in at 5:53 and is the same mix of the song found on the Songs from the Big Chair LP, albeit in an edited form. The version released in Germany and Japan is 4:51 in length and fades out during the guitar solo. Meanwhile, the final version released in America is specifically tailored for radio play at a concise 3:59 in length, featuring edits to the chorus and instrumental sections. ===Release variations=== In addition to the standard 7- and 12-inch releases, the \"Shout\" single was issued in two collectible formats in the UK: a limited edition 10-inch single and a 7-inch boxed pack featuring a 1985 Tears for Fears calendar. A similar limited edition 7-inch pack was released in Canada, this one featuring a 12-page booklet of band photos. In 1988, \"Shout\" was reissued on the short- lived CD Video format. The disc included two mixes of the title track, a remix of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", and the \"Shout\" music video. ==B-side== \"The Big Chair\" was B-side to the \"Shout\" single. Though there are no lyrics, the track contains dialogue samples performed by actors Sally Field and William Prince from the 1976 television film Sybil, from which the song (and the album Songs from the Big Chair) takes its name. This is one of the few songs in the Tears for Fears catalogue on which bandmember Curt Smith shares a writing credit. The song has since been included in the band's B-sides and rarities collection Saturnine Martial & Lunatic (1996) as well as the remastered and deluxe edition reissues of Songs from the Big Chair. ==Music video== The promotional video for \"Shout\", filmed in late 1984, was the second Tears for Fears video directed by famed music video producer Nigel Dick. It features footage of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith at Durdle Door in Dorset, England, as well as at a studio performance with the full band (including Ian Stanley and Manny Elias) performing the song amidst a crowd of family and friends. The video reportedly cost only \u00a314,000 to produce. Along with the clip for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", the \"Shout\" video had a big hand in helping establish Tears for Fears in America due to its heavy airplay on the music video channel MTV. The band had at one time considered making a second video for the song's American single release, as the original was not considered MTV friendly. ==Track listings== 7-inch: Mercury / IDEA8 (United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa) / 880 294-7 (Australia, Europe) / SOV 2351 (Canada) 10-inch: Mercury / IDEA810 (United Kingdom) # \"Shout\" \u2013 5:53 # \"The Big Chair\" \u2013 3:20 7-inch: Mercury / 880 481-7Q (Germany) / 7PP-167 (Japan) # \"Shout [Short Version]\" \u2013 4:51 # \"The Big Chair\" \u2013 3:20 7-inch: Mercury / 880 294-7 (United States) # \"Shout [US Single Version]\" \u2013 3:59 # \"The Big Chair\" \u2013 3:20 12-inch: Mercury / IDEA812 (United Kingdom) / 880 294-1 (Australia, Europe) / SOVX 2351 (Canada) / MIX 3080 (Mexico) # \"Shout [Extended Version]\" \u2013 7:35 # \"Shout\" \u2013 5:53 # \"The Big Chair\" \u2013 3:20 12-inch: Mercury / 880 929-1 (United States) # \"Shout [US Remix]\" \u2013 8:02 # \"Shout [UK Remix]\" \u2013 7:40 # \"The Big Chair\" \u2013 3:20 CDV: Mercury / 080 064-2 (United Kingdom) # \"Shout\" \u2013 5:58 # \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World [Urban Mix Edit]\" \u2013 5:20 # \"Shout [US Remix]\" \u2013 8:00 # \"Shout [Video]\" \u2013 6:00 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1985) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |- |- |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100).
