    "text": "Voices is a musical composition by the German composer Hans Werner Henze. Written between January and June 1973, it is a collection of 22 independent songs which may be performed individually, with alterations to the instrumentation. In its full version, it is written for mezzo-soprano, tenor, electronics and fifteen instrumentalists who are required to play about 70 different instruments from all over the world. The piece consists of two parts (11 + 11 songs) and lasts 90 minutes. The polystylistic conception of \"Voices\" results from the different origin and message of the poems. ref> The songs set a diverse range of words, almost all of which are from the twentieth century, the linking theme being alienation and oppression.Liner notes to the 1978 recording, Decca Records Henze has said: > The voices of the title are those of young and old artists whose work is > politically committed. These people are concerned with their fellow human > beings, with the contemporary human condition within the world around them > and with all the problems of race and class in which they themselves often > seem fated to be embroiled.Henze, Hans Werner (1998) Bohemian Fifths (trans. > S.
