    "text": "The funeral of Denkta\u015f in Cumhuriyet Park, in front of the TMT monument Cumhuriyet Park (, \"Park of the Republic\") is a park in the G\u00f6nyeli quarter of North Nicosia. It is the resting place of Rauf Denkta\u015f, the founder of Northern Cyprus, and is an important tourist attraction. The park covers an area of 100 dunams (approximately 134,000 m2) and is the biggest park and urban green space in Northern Cyprus. In 2007, it was reported by Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131 to be in a poor condition, upon which 400 trees were planted in the park and water supply was restructured. In 2009, eucalyptus trees were planted and 250 more trees were planted in 2011. The park is home to a monument dedicated to the Turkish Resistance Organization (TMT). On 17 January 2012, Rauf Denkta\u015f was buried in the park. His grave lies 150 meters south of the TMT monument. The decision was taken by the cabinet as the park was perceived as a symbol of Northern Cyprus and the struggle of the Turkish Cypriot people. It was announced that a mausoleum would be constructed for Denkta\u015f. The competition for the design of a mausoleum and a museum was announced on 1 September 2012, with a grand prize of 150,000 Turkish liras. The competition had 104 participants, 20% of whom were Turkish Cypriots, and the winners were from Bilgi University, Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University and Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University. However, by 2014, no plans to begin the construction were on the agenda due to budgetary problems and the grave of Denkta\u015f was reportedly in a poor condition. The park lies opposite the Dr Burhan Nalbanto\u011flu State Hospital. == References == Category:Parks in Cyprus Category:Nicosia ",
