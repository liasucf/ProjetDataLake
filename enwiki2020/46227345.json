My videos are a collage of visuals that I like to picture in my head. The song Nimmi Nimmi came together on its own.

Overload has always been my outlet to express my feelings without caring about whatever rules or trends the music industry is following.\" ==Music video== ===Synopsis=== Video depicts a man who possessed all worldly pleasures but still senses a void caused by parting from his lover.
