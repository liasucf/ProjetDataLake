    "text": "SAMSON (Software for Adaptive Modeling and Simulation Of Nanosystems) is a computer software platform for computational nanoscience being developed by the NANO-D group at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA).NANO-D - INRIA SAMSON has a modular architecture that makes it suitable for different domains of nanoscience, including material science, life science, physics, electronics, chemistry, and education.SAMSON ConnectSAMSON 0.7.0 is available - Macs in ChemistryRDKit in SAMSON - Macs in Chemistry ==SAMSON Elements== SAMSON Elements are modules for SAMSON, developed with the SAMSON software development kit (SDK). SAMSON Elements help users perform tasks in SAMSON, including building new models, performing calculations, running interactive or offline simulations, and visualizing and interpreting results. SAMSON Elements may contain different class types, including for example: * Apps \u2013 generic classes with a graphical user interface that extend the functions of SAMSON * Editors \u2013 classes that receive user interaction events to provide editing functions (e.g., model generation, structure deformation, etc.) * Models \u2013 classes that describe properties of nanosystems (see below) * Parsers \u2013 classes that may parse files to add content to SAMSON's data graph (see below) SAMSON Elements expose their functions to SAMSON and other Elements through an introspection mechanism, and may thus be integrated and pipelined. ==Modeling and simulation== SAMSON represents nanosystems using five categories of models: * Structural models \u2013 describe geometry and topology * Visual models \u2013 provide graphical representations * Dynamical models \u2013 describe dynamical degrees of freedom * Interaction models \u2013 describe energies and forces * Property models \u2013 describe traits that do not enter in the first four model categories Simulators (potentially interactive ones) are used to build physically-based models, and predict properties. ==Data graph== All models and simulators are integrated into a hierarchical, layered structure that form the SAMSON data graph. SAMSON Elements interact with each other and with the data graph to perform modeling and simulation tasks. A signals and slots mechanism makes it possible for data graph nodes to send events when they are updated, which makes it possible to develop e.g., adaptive simulation algorithms. ==Node specification language== SAMSON has a node specification language (NSL) that users may employ to select data graph nodes based on their properties. Example NSL expressions include: * `Hydrogen` \u2013 select all hydrogens (short version: `H`) * `atom.chainID > 2` \u2013 select all atoms with a chain ID strictly larger than 2 (short version: `a.ci > 2`) * `Carbon in node.selected` \u2013 select all carbons in the current selection (short version: `C in n.s`) * `bond.order > 1.5` \u2013 select all bonds with order strictly larger than 1.5 (short version: `b.o > 1.5`) * `node.type backbone` \u2013 select all backbone nodes (short version: `n.t bb`) * `O in node.type sidechain` \u2013 select all oxygens in sidechain nodes (short version: `O in n.t sc`) * `\"CA\" within 5A of S` \u2013 select all nodes named CA that are within 5 angstrom of any sulfur atom (short version: `\"CA\" w 5A of S`) * `node.type residue beyond 5A of node.selected` \u2013 select all residue nodes beyond 5 angstrom of the current selection (short version: `n.t r b 5A of n.s`) * `residue.secondaryStructure helix` \u2013 select residue nodes in alpha helices (short version: `r.ss h`) * `node.type sidechain having S` \u2013 select sidechain nodes that have at least one sulfur atom (short version: `n.t sc h S`) * `H linking O` \u2013 select all hydrogens bonded to oxygen atoms (short version: `H l O`) * `C or H` \u2013 select atoms that are carbons or hydrogens ==Features== SAMSON is developed in C++ and implements many features to ease developing SAMSON Elements, including: * Managed memory * Signals and slots * Serialization * Multilevel undo-redo * Introspection * Referencing * Unit system * Functors and predicate logic * SAMSON Element source code generators ==SAMSON Connect== SAMSON, SAMSON Elements and the SAMSON Software Development Kit are distributed via the SAMSON Connect website. The site acts as a repository for the SAMSON Elements being uploaded by developers, and users of SAMSON choose and add Elements from SAMSON Connect. ==See also== * Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling * Gabedit * Jmol * Molden * Molecular design software * Molekel * PyMol * RasMol * UCSF Chimera * Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) ==References== Category:Computational chemistry software Category:Nanotechnology Category:Simulation software ",
