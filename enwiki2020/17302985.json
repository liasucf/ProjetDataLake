It flows from the Coast Mountains southwest to Behm Canal, northeast of Ketchikan, Alaska. From its headwaters in a heavily glaciated area in British Columbia, south of the lower Iskut River, the Unuk flows west and south for , crossing into Alaska and emptying into Burroughs Bay, an inlet of Behm Canal. In Alaska the river flows through the Misty Fjords National Monument.Unuk River Chinook Salmon Studies, Alaska Department of Fish and Game In Tlingit it is called Joon\u00e1x\u0331, the meaning of which is obscure but may have to do with dreaming (cf. aawajoon \u201che dreamed\u201d). It is occasionally referred to as Oon\u00e1x\u0331, which is a reduced form. The USGS reports that a 1906 publication said the correct name for the river is \u201cJunuk\u201d or \u201cJunock\u201d, but it is unclear whether the initial sound is supposed to be an affricate or an approximant . The former sound would reflect the full Tlingit name, the latter the English adaptation. The Unuk River supports relatively large runs of salmon, including chinook, coho, pink, chum, and sockeye. ==References== The name Unuk is derived from the Tlingit name for the area, Joon\u00e1xh (Place of Dreams). ==External links== * Category:Rivers of Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of the Boundary Ranges Category:Stikine Country Category:International rivers of North America ",
