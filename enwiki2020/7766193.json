The station is owned by Rogers Media which also owns sister stations CHYM-FM and CKGL. CIKZ was licensed to Larche Communications, the station's original owner, by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission in 2003, CRTC Decision 2003-153 and began broadcasting on February 6, 2004 at 99.5 FM. However, the station later changed to 106.7 FM in 2005, due to interference from WDCX-FM in Buffalo. CRTC Decision 2005-168 Larche Communications later also launched CICZ-FM in Midland and CICS-FM in Sudbury. On June 4, 2007, Larche announced a deal to sell CIKZ to Rogers in exchange for CICX-FM in Orillia. The deal, which was approved by the CRTC on December 24, 2007, placed CIKZ in a cluster with Rogers' existing CKGL and CHYM-FM in Kitchener.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-434 On January 28, 2008, the station modified its on-air identity to reflect the new ownership. This included some of the on-air personalities and its web site, as well as the adjustment of its branding and logo from KICX (the spelling used by Larche) to KIX. Shortly thereafter, Rogers moved the station's studios, previously in Waterloo, to the Rogers facility in downtown Kitchener.KIX 106 blog entry referring to move right On May 30, 2013, the station was rebranded as Country 106.7, as part of Rogers' rebranding of its country-formatted stations to a unified brand.
