    "text": "Gabriela is a 1975 Brazilian telenovela based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Jorge Amado, starring S\u00f4nia Braga in the title role. A remake was produced and aired by Globo in 2012, with Juliana Paes playing the lead role. == Plot == Walter George Durst's free adaptation based on the novel Jorge Amado's Gabriela, Cravo e Canela (1958), takes place in 1925, when a devastating drought forces the hungry populations of the Brazilian Northeast to emigrate in search of survival. In the novel, the destination is Ilh\u00e9us, in the south of Bahia, a region in expansion thanks to the planting and commerce of cacao. Gabriela (S\u00f4nia Braga) is one of the victims of the drought. Free and impulsive, she gets a job as a cook at the home of the \"Turkish\" Nacib (Armando B\u00f3gus), with whom she lives a sensual love story. == Background == Gabriela was created to give time to production of the telenovela O Rebu, by Braulio Pedroso. But this one was aired before, and Gabriela was aired to celebrate the ten years of TV Globo. The plot, according with Daniel Filho, was thought taking into account a narrative structure based on different episodes. Daniel Filho says that during the search for the ideal woman to live Gabriela, tried an unusual choice: he made an invitation to Gal Costa. The singer from Bahia, meanwhile, declined, claiming she did not know how to perform. Then numerous tests were done for the character; But the director decided that the role would have to be of S\u00f4nia Braga since seeing his performance in Caminhos do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 Caso Especial written and directed by Domingos Oliveira in 1971 -, and insisted with Boni that she be chosen. The actress ended up consecrated in the paper, that would represent again in 1983, in the film Gabriela directed by Bruno Barreto, acting alongside the Italian Marcello Mastroianni. Gabriela was the first Brazilian telenovela to aired in Portugal in May 1977, on RTP, and consecrated S\u00f4nia Braga as a sex symbol. == Cast == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
