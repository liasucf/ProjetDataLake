    "text": "{| |+ Pilo Class |} The Rosolino Pilo class was a class of eight destroyers of the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) constructed before and during the First World War. Like other obsolete Italian destroyers, they were reclassified as torpedo boats in 1929, and seven ships served throughout the Second World War. Two ships were sunk by mines while under Italian service during the Second World War, with two more being seized by Nazi Germany following the Italian Armistice in 1943. The remaining three ships survived the war and continued in use with the post-war Italian Navy, with the last two of the class being decommissioned in 1958. == German capture == Following Italy's surrender on 8 September 1943, Germany captured two of the Pilo-class vessels. Giuseppe Missori was renamed TA22, and Giuseppe Dezza was renamed TA35. These vessels were re-designated as torpedo boats and put into service with the Kriegsmarine. TA22 was attacked by the all-African American fighter group, the Tuskegee Airmen, who put her out of action. TA35 was sunk on 17 August 1944. == Operators == * * == Ships== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" |-valign=top ! | Name ! | PennantFraccaroli 1970, p. 72. ! | Builder ! | Laid down ! | Launched ! | Completed ! | Fate |- |-valign=top | | | | PN | | Odero, Sestri Ponente | | 19 August 1913 | | 24 March 1915 | | 25 May 1915 | | Stricken October 1954 |-valign=top | | | | AB | | Odero, Sestri Ponente | | 19 August 1913 | | 25 May 1915 | | 6 July 1915 | | Stricken September 1958 |-valign=top | | | | BR | | Odero, Sestri Ponente | | 12 September 1913 | | 26 October 1915 | | 1 January 1916 | | Renamed Giuseppe Dezza 16 January 1921.
