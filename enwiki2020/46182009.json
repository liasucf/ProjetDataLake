The Cobden Centre was intending to organise a four-day exhibition in the European Parliament in November 2015 showcasing digital currencies to the MEPs. It claimed it was to have been the first of its kind in any Parliament in the world and would involve demonstrations of Bitcoin ATMs and other related technologies. The Cobden Centre is named after Richard Cobden, the 19th century classical liberal who campaigned against the Corn Laws and in favour of free trade and individual liberty. The Cobden Centre has a commercial arm called Cobden Partners, which specialises in advice on economics from an Austrian School perspective.
