    "text": "The Jamund\u00ed Massacre () was a massacre perpetrated by a Colombian National Army elite unit known as the High Mountain Battalion (\"Batall\u00f3n de Alta Monta\u00f1a\") which was then commanded by Colonel Byron Carvajal against an elite Colombian National Police counter-narcotics unit on May 22, 2006 in the municipality of Jamund\u00ed, Department of Valle del Cauca. ==Indictments== On February 18, 2008 a civil judge in Cali condemned 15 soldiers for the massacre of ten policemen and a civilian. Initially the spokesman from the Army battalion referred to it as a friendly fire incident, confusing the anti- narcotics unit with an insurgent group. The case however, was investigated and resulted in the indictment of the soldiers for being at the service of drug cartels. El Tiempo: La masacre de Jamund\u00ed Colombian authorities suspected Diego Le\u00f3n Montoya S\u00e1nchez aka \"Don Diego\" as the mastermind behind the attack. ==See also== *List of massacres in Colombia == References == Category:Mass murder in 2005 Category:Massacres in Colombia ",
