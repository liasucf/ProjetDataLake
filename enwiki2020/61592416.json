It is the entirety of conditioned phenomena, also referred to as the trichiliocosm. As a term, its usage is comparable to the Earth (p\u1e5bthiv\u012b) or as the place where all beings are subject to the cycle of birth and death (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). It is the place where both good and evil manifests and where beings must exercise patience and endurance (k\u1e63\u0101nti). It is also described as the place where \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha teaches the Dharma. The Sah\u0101 world is divided into three distinct realms or worlds (traidh\u0101tuka or trailokya). Its ruler is Mah\u0101brahm\u0101 Sah\u0101mpati. ==Etymology== Sah\u0101 is a Sanskrit term meaning \"together\" or \"enduring.\" Chinese texts sometimes translate the term as \u5fcd\u571f (pinyin: R\u011bnt\u01d4), literally \"land of endurance.\" ==Composition== ===Realm of Desire=== The desire realm (k\u0101madh\u0101tu) is where all sentient beings consist of a physical body and are susceptible to the experience of sense faculties. These beings are generally composed of 18 elements (dh\u0101tu), that include the sense bases and their respective modes of consciousness. In Buddhist cosmology, the desire realm is often described as being composed of four continents (c\u0101turdv\u012bpaka) which surround Mount Sumeru, which itself is surrounded by oceans and mountain ranges. The four continents are *Jambudv\u012bpa in the South *P\u016brvavideha in the East *Uttarakuru in the North *Avaragod\u0101n\u012bya in the West ===Realm of Form=== ===Realm of Non-Form=== ==As a Pure Land== The Vimalakirti Sutra further elaborates on the nature of the Sah\u0101 world. It is treated as a pure land of its own, under the jurisdiction of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha. It has ten features distinct from other pure lands: #The poor are attracted by charity #The transgressors are attracted by pure precepts #The angry are attracted by forbearance #The lazy are attracted by exertion #The perturbed are attracted by meditation #The foolish are attracted by wisdom #Those who experience the eight difficulties are saved by explanation of how to eliminate difficulties #Those who take pleasure in the Hinayana are saved by the teaching of the Mahayana #Those without merit may be saved by the various good roots #The liberation of sentient beings is constantly being accomplished by means of the four attractions ==See also== *Buddhist cosmology *Trailokya *Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism) *Sah\u0101 Triad ==References== Category:Buddhist cosmology Category:Pure lands ",
