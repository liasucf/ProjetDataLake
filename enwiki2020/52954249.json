In Wabak, Papatie tells the story of the first Algonquian to be born and the experiences, good or evil, the young child will encounter through his path. Wabak earned Papatie and his co- director Gilles Penobsway two prizes, the Main Film Jeune Espoir (Young Hope) prize at the First Peoples\u2019 Festival 2007 in Montreal and the Best Experimental Film at the Winnipeg Aboriginal Film Festival in 2007. During that same year Kevin Papatie directed his second short, Le bon sens. In 2007, Kevin Papatie released two short documentaries, Un grand d\u00e9part and The Amendment, which won the imagineNATIVE Best Indigenous Language Production Award when it was shown as part of ShortCuts Canada at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Later that year The Amendment was given a theatrical release as a short film preceding Denys Arcand's The Age of Ignorance. It went on to win the 2008 Prix de l\u2019image Sony at the festival Filmer \u00e0 tout prix in Brussels and the 2009 Identity Award at the Festival de cine de los Pueblos Indigenas y las naciones sin de Valparaiso in Chile. In 2008 Papatie released Entre l'arbre et l'\u00e9corce, which won the Artistic Creation Mention from the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu\u00e9bec for the annual of \"Rendez-vous du cin\u00e9ma qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\" in Montreal and the Identity Award at Festival de cine de los Pueblos Indigenas y las naciones sin de Valparaiso in Chili. His 2009 short film Nous Sommes was screened for the first time and in the following year won the Prix de la D\u00e9couverte (Discovery Prize) at the Festival de films de Portneuf sur l\u2019environnement in Portnef. M\u00e9tis scholar Karine Bertrand has commented on Papatie's work, stating that he \"encompasses the majority of the themes exploited by the young filmmakers of the Wapikoni, namely the quest for identity, the questions of transmission, intergenerational relationships and contemporary conflicts between tradition and modernity\". == Filmography == * Wabak (2006) * Le bon sens (2006) * Un grand d\u00e9part (A great Departure) (2007) * The Amendment (2007) * Entre l'arbre et l'\u00e9corce (Between two Worlds) (2008) * Nous Sommes (We are) (2009) * Waseya dizihin (Treasure of light) (2010) * Indian taxi (2011) * Shamanitu (2012) * Sakitakwin (Freedom) (2012) * Le r\u00eave (The Dream) (2013) * Kokom (2014) * Trente-cinq (Thirty five) (2016) == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Award Name !Festival / Awards Ceremony !Name of Film !Year |- |Best Experimental Film |Winnipeg Aboriginal Film Festival |Wabak (2006) |2007 |- |Best Indigenous Language Film |ImagineNATIVE Film Festival |The Amendment (2008) |2008 |} == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Algonquin people Category:Film directors from Quebec Category:First Nations filmmakers Category:Canadian documentary film directors ",
