    "text": "In the Ullmann condensation or Ullmann-type reaction is the copper-promoted conversion of aryl halides to aryl ethers, aryl thioethers, aryl nitriles, and aryl amines. These reactions are examples of cross-coupling reactions. Ullmann-type reactions are comparable to Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions but usually require higher temperatures. Traditionally these reaction requires high-boiling polar solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone, nitrobenzene, or dimethylformamide and high temperatures (often in excess of 210 \u00b0C) with stoichiometric amounts of copper. Aryl halide were required to be activated by electron-withdrawing groups. Traditional Ullmann style reactions used \"activated\" copper powder, e.g. prepared in situ by the reduction of copper sulfate by zinc metal in hot water. The methodology improved with the introduction of soluble copper catalysts supported by diamines and acetylacetonate ligands. ==Ullmann ether synthesis: C-O coupling== Illustrative of the traditional Ullmann ether synthesis is the preparation of p-nitrophenyl phenyl ether from 4-chloronitrobenzene and phenol. :O2NC6H4Cl + HOC6H5 \\+ KOH \u2192 O2NC6H4OC6H5 \\+ KCl + H2O Modern arylations use soluble copper catalysts. ==Goldberg reaction: C-N coupling== A traditional Goldberg reaction is illustrated by the synthesis of fenamic acid, an intermediate in the preparation of acridone: Synthesis of fenamic acid Aryl iodides are favored arylating agents. The catalyst used is formed from copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline. As this reaction proceeds well with an electron-rich aryl iodide it is a valuable alternative to the Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination reaction, which gives best yields with electron-poor aryl halides. The scope is extended to amides. Buchwald amidation reaction ==Hurtley reaction: C-C coupling== The nucleophile can also be carbon as in a carbanion as well as cyanide. In the traditional Hurtley reaction, the carbon nucleophiles were derived from malonic ester and other dicarbonyl compounds: The Hurtley reaction More modern Cu-catalyzed C-C cross-couplings utilize soluble copper complexes containing phenanthroline ligands. ==C\u2013S coupling== The arylation of alkylthiolates proceeds by the intermediacy of cuprous thiolates. ==Mechanism of Ullmann-type reactions== In the case of Ullmann-type reactions (aminations, etherifications, etc. of aryl halides), the reaction involves copper(I) alkoxide, copper(I) amides, copper(I) thiolates. The copper(I) reagent can be generated in situ from the aryl halide and copper metal. Even copper(II) sources are effective. A number of innovations have been developed with regards to copper reagents. These copper(I) compounds subsequently react with the aryl halide in a net metathesis reaction: :Ar-X + ROCu \u2192 Ar-OR + CuX :Ar-X + RSCu \u2192 Ar-SR + CuX :Ar-X + 2 RNHCu \u2192 Ar-NHR + CuX In the case of C-N coupling, kinetic studies implicate oxidative addition reaction followed by reductive elimination from Cu(III) intermediates (Ln = one or more spectator ligands): :ROCuAr(X)Ln \u2192 RO-Ar + CuLn ==History== The Ullmann ether synthesis or is named after its inventor, Fritz Ullmann. The corresponding Goldberg reaction, is named after Irma Goldberg. The Hurtley reaction, which involves C-C bond formation, is similarly named after its inventor. ==References== Category:Carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions Category:Condensation reactions Category:Name reactions ",
