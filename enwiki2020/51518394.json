To encourage people to participate with empathy in this movement, handful of grains and a glass of water were collected from 2,35,000 households to create a gigantic bundi laddu of 300,000 kilogram with the diameter of 65 feet and 35 feet of height.

He knew how uncertain rain affect annual crop yield. To resolve this, water conservation at very large capacity was necessary. To start in that direction, in his native village Ugamedi in Botad district of Gujarat, he dug 3 ponds of 3.5 km in length, up to 45 feet of depth & 400 feet of width that can store nearly 2.5 crore litres of fresh water, making them largest artificial ponds in Gujarat. The village river Sonal supposed to fill these ponds, however during following weak monsoon it was seen that these huge ponds could not be filled with river Sonal alone. After pondering over the condition he analyzed that there is another river Keri 2.5 kilometre away from village. He diverted water from river Keri that was flowing away to the ocean to river Sonal by RCC pipeline of 3 feet diameter to fill 3 huge ponds. In this way, first time in India, he paid tribute to Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his vision of interlinking rivers. This project aims to provide resolution to the perennial problem of the water scarcity and 90 percent funded by Laljibhai on his own. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1955 births Category:Indian billionaires Category:Businesspeople from Gujarat Category:People from Surat Category:Gujarati people Category:Diamond industry in India Category:Living people ",
