In 1615 a new friary was built on Cook Street. A chapel on the site was destroyed in 1619 and later rebuilt.Franciscans in Merchants Quay The Franciscans secretly said Mass in the Adam and Eve Tavern, where the popular name of the present church comes from.Merchants Quay Ireland / Profile and History In 1759 a newer church was built, which was later replaced by the current church. After the Catholic Emancipation in 1829, they set about building a church and laid the foundation stone of the current church in 1834. The original design was by the architect Patrick Byrne who planned a tower on the Merchant's Quay entrance. However due to financial problems the church was built without a nave or tower.Conlan, Patrick, (2004). \"Guide to the Church of the Immaculate Conception and Friary of Adam and Eve, Dublin\", Church leaflet The church was originally dedicated to Saint Francis but in 1889 it was rededicated to the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady. After 1900, the church was reorganised with the moving of the altar to the left wall and the original sanctuary was changed into a transept and entrance from Cook Street. A small nave was added to the right and a dome built over the sanctuary. In 1912 a shrine to Saint Anthony was built in 1912 to designs by the architects Doolin, Butler and Donnelly. In 1926 to celebrate the seventh centenary of Saint Francis, the friars built a circular apse, remodelled the transepts and extended the nave with an entrance to Skippers Alley. The consecration of the high altar took place on 21 September 1928 by Dr. Paschal Robinson, titular Archbishop of Tyana (1870-1948). ==Organ== The organ of Adam and Eve's was built by T.W. Magahy in 1936 using pipework from the old Telford organ there. It was rebuilt in 1996 by Trevor Crowe Ldt. There are around 3,000 pipes in the organ, seventy of which are gilded and incorporated in the casework. It is claimed to be the largest pipe organ in a Catholic church in Dublin and is very highly regarded.
