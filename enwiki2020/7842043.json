She was educated at Tinker's Farm Girls' School, Fircroft College and Bournville Day Continuation College. She joined the Labour Party in 1945 and was nominated director of her local Co-operative board in 1951. A year later, Fisher was elected a member of the Birmingham City Council, in which she sat until 1974. Subsequently, she served as a member of the Warrington and Runcorn Development Corporation until 1989. Fisher was National President of the Co-operative Party Guild in 1961 and was appointed a Justice of the Peace. ==Parliamentary career== She contested Birmingham Ladywood in 1969 at a by- election in which Wallace Lawler of the Liberals gained the seat from Labour. In the following general election, Fisher defeated him when she was returned as the constituency MP, representing the seat until the February 1974 general election when her seat was altered in boundary changes. After her departure from the House of Commons, she was created a life peer as Baroness Fisher of Rednal, of Rednal, in the City of Birmingham on 2 July 1974. In the House of Lords, Fisher became Crown Representative of the General Medical Council in September 1974 and later chaired the Esperanto Group.

She was vice-president of the Institute of Trading Standards Administration (today the Trading Standards Institute). In December 1991, at the age of 72, Lady Fisher slept rough in a nest of cardboard boxes at Birmingham's St Philip's Cathedral to draw attention to the plight of the city's homeless. ==Personal life== She married Joseph Fisher, a sheet-metal- worker at the Longbridge plant, in 1939 and had two daughters. Her husband died in 1978 and she survived him until 2005, when she died aged 86. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1919 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Alumni of Fircroft College Category:Councillors in Birmingham, West Midlands Fisher of Rednal Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Fisher of Rednal Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:20th-century women MEPs for England Category:MEPs for the United Kingdom 1973\u20131979 Category:Labour Party (UK) MEPs Category:20th-century British women politicians ",
