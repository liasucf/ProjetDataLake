Under this programme Indian navy intends to acquire 6 advanced missile Corvettes. Ships in this class will be armed with anti-ship or land attack missiles like Brahmos or Nirbhay. Ships under this class will feature advanced stealth features like low Radar Cross Section (RCS), Infrared, Acoustic and magnetic signature. == Development == On 2 January 2015 Ministry of Defence (MOD) issued a Request For Information (RFI) under Buy Indian and Make Indian category for 6 new missile corvettes by initiating Next Generation Missile Vessels (NGMVs) programme. Vendors who choose to respond to the RFI must meet \"minimum qualifying criteria\" mainly, shipyard should have already built \"vessel(s) of similar specifications\". An RfP worth $2.2 billions was filed by government of India to various Indian shipyards seeking for various warships including 6 missile boats. == Design and description == The RFI suggests that ships will be about 2000-2,500 tonnes each. The new ships will have a complement of 11 officers, 2 trainee officers and 80 sailors. The range will be at least 2800 nm (1000 nm at full throttle) and speed performance will be 25 knots (max speed of 35 kn). The ships will carry 8 surface-to-surface missiles, a full-fledged SAM system with point defence capabilities and a 15 km range MR gun system. The ships will also have radar and EO (Electro-optically) guided close in weapon systems (CIWS) with 360-degree anti-missile defence. == See also == * Project 75I-class submarine * Kamorta-class corvette * Indian Navy Multi-Role Support Vessel programme * Future of the Indian Navy == References == Category:Naval ships of India Category:Ships built in India Category:2020s ships ",
