The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 176 - 177. ==History== ===Origins of the clan=== The surname Jardine is derived from jardin which is French for garden or orchard. However the genealogist, Black, has suggested that this does not mean that they were gardeners, but that they resided near to a garden. The du Jardon family came over to England in 1066 with William the Conqueror. The name is first found in Scotland in charters to Kelso Abbey and Arbroath Abbey prior to 1153, when Wmfredus de Jardin appears as a witness. In about 1178 Humphrey de Jardin witnessed a charter by Robert Bruce to Arbroath Abbey. The name Jardine is also found in the form of de Gardinus and Patrick de Gardinus was chaplain to the Bishop of Glasgow during the early thirteenth century. Sir Humphrey de Gardino witnessed a registration of the lands of Annandale in 1245. Another variant of the name is found in the Ragman Rolls of 1296 where Jorden del Orchard appears rendering homage for his lands in Linlithgow to Edward I of England. The chiefly line of the Clan Jardine appears to have been established by the fourteenth century at Applegirth on the River Annan in Dumfriesshire. Their first stronghold was Spedlings Tower which was abandoned in the late seventeenth century. From there the family moved across the river to Jardine Hall. This was allegedly to escape the ghost of a miller who had been left to starve to death in the tower's dungeon. ===16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars=== Sir Alexander Jardine of Applegirth was actively involved in defending the Scottish Borders against English incursions. In 1524 Sir Alexander Jardine, along with Lord Maxwell attacked an English host near Carlisle and routed them, taking nearly three hundred English prisoners. However Alexander's son, John Jardine, faced English retribution in 1547 when Lord Wharton, with a force of over five thousand, overran Annandale. The Jardine lands were ravaged and he was forced to submit. Later that year the Jardines and some French troops harried the English and exacted a terrible retribution. The Jardines followed the Clan Johnstone in supporting Mary, Queen of Scots. However, when the queen married the Earl of Bothwell the Jardines declared allegiance to the infant James VI of Scotland. For the support of his clan, Jardine was to receive a pension from the Archbishopric of Glasgow, but it was never paid. ===17th and 18th centuries=== Another John Jardine, fourth in descent from Sir Alexander, married Margaret Douglas who was the sister of the first Duke of Queensberry. Their elder son, Alexander Jardine, was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1672. The fourth baronet lived on the Continent and embraced the Catholic faith, becoming a Knight of the Sovereign Order of Malta. He died in 1790 and was succeeded by his brother, Sir William. Yet another William was Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet who distinguished himself as an author and editor of works of natural history. ===Modern history=== Sir William Jardine, twelfth Baronet and twenty-third chief of Clan Jardine was active in promoting clan activities and also served on the Committee of the Council of Chiefs. ==Clan castles== Spedlings (Spedlins) Tower, the original seat of the chiefs of Clan Jardine.Speldins Tower canmore.rcahms.gov.uk.
