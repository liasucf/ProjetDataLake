Building Peace in West Africa: Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau, 2002. Page 47. The LPC emerged in 1993, partly as a proxy force for the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL). It made substantial gains against the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in southeastern Liberia, vying for control of commercial operations in timber and rubber. A predominantly ethnic Krahn organization, it drew supporters from the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) and the AFL, but also from other ethnic groups who suffered under NPFL occupation. It had about 2,500 militants in its ranks. Like all groups that participated in the civil war, the LPC committed serious human rights abuses including murder, torture, and looting in an effort to terrorize and depopulate rural areas held by the NPFL. ==References== Category:History of Liberia Category:Rebel groups in Liberia Category:Krahn people ",
