    "text": "Songs for Clem is an album by Canadian singer-songwriter by Sarah Harmer, credited to Harmer and Jason Euringer, and released in 1999. ==History== The album was never originally intended by Harmer for widespread release, but as a 1998 Christmas gift for her father, Clem Harmer. It features Harmer's personal, home-recorded renditions of several of her father's favourite pop and country standards. Upon hearing the recording, Harmer's friends and family convinced her to release it independently. She did so in 1999; following her commercial breakthrough in 2000 with You Were Here, the album was re-released under Harmer's new major label distribution deal with Universal Music Canada. Clem Harmer subsequently appeared on Sarah's 2005 album I'm A Mountain, contributing backing vocals to two songs. ==Reception== Allmusic music critic Johnny Lofthus wrote the album feels \"lovingly handmade, with cover art right out of a child's Father's Day art project and an immediate, field-type recording quality that features accompaniment from crickets and a passing rainstorm. This isn't to say it's lo-fi; on the contrary, it's crystal clear.\" and that \"... it's a true sentimental journey for people inspired by their parents to love music.\" ==Track listing== #\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" (Bill Monroe) \u2013 2:07 #\"Tennessee Waltz\" (Redd Stewart, Pee Wee King) \u2013 2:52 #\"Black Coffee\" (Sonny Burke, Paul Francis Webster) \u2013 2:53 #\"Stormy Weather\" (Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler) \u2013 3:00 #\"Oh Bury Me Not\" (Traditional) \u2013 1:25 #\"Just a Closer Walk With Thee\" (Traditional) \u2013 3:22 #\"Shine on Harvest Moon\" (Jack Norworth, Nora Bayes) \u2013 2:13 #\"Trouble in the Fields\" (Nanci Griffith, Rick West) \u2013 4:02 #\"Your Cheatin' Heart\" (Hank Williams) \u2013 2:32 #\"Summertime\" (George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward, Ira Gershwin) \u2013 3:45 #\"Sentimental Journey\" (Les Brown, Ben Homer, Bud Green) \u2013 2:44 #\"O, My Beloved Father\" (Giacomo Puccini, Giovacchino Forzano) \u2013 2:07 ==Personnel== *Sarah Harmer \u2013 vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica *Jason Euringer \u2013 bass, guitar, background vocals, slides *Spencer Evans \u2013 clarinet, piano, background vocals *Benji Perosin \u2013 trumpet ==Production== *Produced by Sarah Harmer *Mastered by Jan Turney and Graeme McCann *Engineered and mixed by Robin Aube, assisted by Tom Lawless *Photography by Kelsey Finlayson ==References== Category:1999 albums Category:Sarah Harmer albums ",
