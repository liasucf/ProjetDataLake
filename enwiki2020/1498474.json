It is associated with marriages, where the bride and groom would hold hands through the hole during the ceremony. There is an old legend regarding a black horse that inhabits the field in which the holestone is situated. According to this legend a young couple were married at the stone, but the groom committed an act of adultery on their wedding night. For this act he was cursed by the stone to spend eternity as a horse, never dying, and never able to leave that field unless the gate is left open. Joseph's belt == Literature == Parkgate was the site of the Cats For Peru hoax in 1870, related in Arthur McKeown's 1998 book, The Man From Peru. While McKeown's book is cast as a storybook, a primer for students of English as a second language, local historians attest to the truth of the story. See, for example, Where the Six Mile Water Flows by Jack McKinney (Friars Bush Press 1991). ==Population== ===2011 Census=== In the 2011 Census Parkgate had a population of 676 people (256 households).
