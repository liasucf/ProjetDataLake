    "text": "RS Basingstoke F.C. was a long running and successful amateur football club based in Basingstoke. ==History== The Club were founded in 1971 as a pub side, Soldiers Return, and originally played Sunday football before switching to Saturday where they joined the Basingstoke League. After successfully climbing up through the divisions the side became founder members of the Chiltonian League in 1984 where they remained for two seasons before joining the North Hants League, which they won in 1986\u201387 resulting in their application to join Hampshire League Division 2 being successful. Upon election the team then became known as SR Basingstoke and promptly proceeded to win promotion as champions in their debut season and soon established themselves in Division 1. In 1990 the club became known as DCA Basingstoke and finished runners-up in 1990\u201391. In 1992 the club successfully applied to move up to the Combined Counties League where they maintained a steady mid-table position but, unable to develop their basic Whiteditch Playing Fields home they dropped out of the league after four seasons to rejoin the Chiltonian League in 1996 - a year later the club was renamed again as RS Basingstoke. When the Chiltonian League was absorbed by the extended Hellenic League in 2000, RS Basingstoke joined and were placed in Division 1 East where they finished runners-up in their first season, but again due to ground grading were unable to apply for promotion. In 2003 RS Basingstoke returned to the Hampshire League where they were placed in Division 2. The side finished 3rd and like most of the leagues other clubs they moved into the extended Wessex League in 2004 where they were placed in Division 3. This was the seventh league that they had played in during their existence! 2004\u201305 was sadly to prove the last season for the club as, despite being in a comfortable mid-table position, a player exodus resulted in the side withdrawing from the competition in January 2005 and folding. ==Honours== *Hellenic League Division 1 East **Runners-up 2000/01 *Hampshire League Division 1 **Runners-up 1990/91 *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1987/88 *North Hants League Champions **Winners 1986/87 *North Hants Senior Cup **Winners 1988/89 *Basingstoke & District League **Champions *Basingstoke Senior Cup **Winners ==Records== === League === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events |- |1984/85||Chiltonian League||8/17||Founder Members |- |1985/86||Chiltonian League||4/10||Left competition |- |1986/87||North Hants League||1/14 ||Champions, promoted |- |1987/88||Hampshire League Division 2||1/19||Champions, promoted |- |1988/89||Hampshire League Division 1||8/17|| |- |1989/90||Hampshire League Division 1||12/18|| |- |1990/91||Hampshire League Division 1||2/19||Runners- up, not promoted |- |1991/92||Hampshire League Division 1||6/18||Promoted |- |1992/93||Combined Counties League||13/19|| |- |1993/94||Combined Counties League||6/21|| |- |1994/95||Combined Counties League||9/18|| |- |1995/96||Combined Counties League||14/22||Demoted on ground grading |- |1996/97||Chiltonian League||6/18|| |- |1997/98||Chiltonian League||3/18|| |- |1998/99||Chiltonian League||7/13|| |- |1999/00||Chiltonian League||5/17||Chiltonian League absorbed by Hellenic League in 2000 |- |2000/01||Hellenic League Division 1 East||2/17||Runners-up, not promoted |- |2001/02||Hellenic League Division 1 East||3/17|| |- |2002/03||Hellenic League Division 1 East||11/17||Left competition |- |2003/04||Hampshire League Division 2||3/15||Hampshire League absorbed by Wessex League in 2004 |- |2004/05||Wessex League Division 2||21/22||Withdrew, record expunged |} ==References== *https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5556248.rs-call-time-on- their-34-years-of-football/ * * * * Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1971 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2005 Category:1971 establishments in England Category:2005 disestablishments in England Category:Sport in Basingstoke Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire Category:Basingstoke and District Football League Category:Chiltonian League Category:North Hants League Category:Hampshire League Category:Combined Counties Football League Category:Hellenic Football League Category:Wessex Football League ",
