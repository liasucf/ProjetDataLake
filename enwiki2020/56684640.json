    "text": "Hen Ogledd, around the time the saints discussed here were alive (late 6th & early 7th centuries) This is a list of saints associated with Cumbria and the Hen Ogledd: many of them will have links to sites elsewhere in regions with significant ancient British history, such as Wales, Cornwall, Brittany or Devon. == Saint Kentigern == Saint Kentigern, or Mungo is said to have been the son of Taneu, a princess of Gododdin, in the Hen Ogledd. He is believed to have died c. 612. Taneu became pregnant after she was raped by the leader of Rheged, Owain mab Urien. Later in his life, after expulsion from Pictland, the region of the Picts, he was invited to live in another Hen Ogledd kingdom called Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde). == Saint Patrick == Saint Patrick Saint Patrick lived in Britain in the 5th century. At the age of 16 he was kidnapped by Irish pirates. He spent 6 years in Ireland until he escaped and returned to Britain. Later, he became ordained in Britain and returned to Ireland, where it is believed that he performed numerous miracles. In some traditions he was born in Glannoventa, now modern day Ravenglass in Cumbria, which was then part of the kingdom of Rheged of the Hen Ogledd. == Saint Oswald and Saint Cuthbert == :Although Saint Oswald and Saint Cuthbert were Anglian not Cumbrian in origin, their names often appear in Old Welsh texts and so must have been venerated by the people of Cumbria. Saint Oswald (c. 604 - 642) and Saint Cuthbert (634/635 - 687) are recorded in many texts from the Hen Ogledd as being part of names with the element gos, meaning servant of, for example, in Jocelin's lives of the Saints Gospatrick, Gosmungo (an alias, Mungo's real name is Kentigern), Gososwald and Goscuthbert, the form of gos is unique in Cumbric. As well as this, the fact that many people in the Hen Ogledd chose to use these saints in their names is evidence for a cult of these saints in the region. This is mentioned by John Reuben Davies. John T. Koch also makes reference to this in a variety of his works. In the White Book of Rhydderch there is a mention of Gospatrick, in the Black Book of Carmarthen there is an alternate spelling as Gosparth, for example. == References == Category:Hen Ogledd Category:Patron saints Category:7th-century English people Hen Ogledd ",
