He served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1761. Shore was active as an ironmaster. He was also involved in the River Don navigation scheme; and the Sheffield Town Trust.

The younger Samuel Shore moved there, on his second marriage in 1788. Shore was brought into political work on a national stage by Christopher Wyvill. In 1791 he supported Joseph Gales in founding the Sheffield Constitutional Society.Michael James Daly, From Sheffield to Raleigh: a Radical Publishing Network in the Age of Revolution (PDF), at p. 157 note 153 In 1819 Shore chaired a large public meeting in Sheffield, to ask the Prince Regent to have an inquiry made into the Peterloo Massacre. In 1820 his name was put forward for at the general election: but Shore was by then confined to his bed. The proposal was mischief made by Peter Crompton. ==Family== Shore married: #Urith Offley, daughter of Joseph Offley, who died in 1781; #Lydia Flower, daughter of Freeman Flower, in 1788.
