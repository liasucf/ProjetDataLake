It was working by wind until 1920, when it was stopped owing to a weak weatherbeam. Today, the recording studios of Sir Paul McCartney are to be found at the mill. ==Description== Hogg Hill Mill is a post mill on a two- storey roundhouse. It has four spring sails carried on a cast iron windshaft and is winded by a roof mounted fantail, one of only two surviving post mills in England with this feature, and the only one where this can still be seen.The other mill is at Ramsey, Essex, which has not carried its fantail since 1939 The mill drove two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The brake wheel has been removed, but the wooden tail wheel is of clasp arm construction. ==Millers== *John Skinner 1781 - 1790 (Pett) *William Sargeant 1791 *John Sargeant 1834 - 1855 *Lewis Sargent 1855 - 1874 (Source - census returns) *Garndner Bros 1890 - 1920 References for above:- ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Windmill World Page on Windmill Hill Mill. ==Further reading== Online version Category:Post mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grinding mills in the United Kingdom Category:Windmills completed in 1781 Category:Paul McCartney Category:Windmills in East Sussex sv:Hogg Hill Mill, Icklesham ",
