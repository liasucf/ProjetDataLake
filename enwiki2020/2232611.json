It is a collegial body approved by the Holy See and has as its particular aim: In recent times, the Conference's application of the revision of the English translation of the Mass liturgy has been criticized as premature.Southern African bishops seek Vatican OK to keep new Mass translations ==Organization== The conference is led by a president and two vice presidents, each elected by an absolute majority of the members for three year terms. The members also elect chairmen and vice-chairmen for the departments of the conference. All office holders must be diocesean ordinaries; coadjutor bishops, auxiliary bishops, and bishops emeriti may not be elected. The president, vice presidents, department chairmen, and any Cardinals who do not hold a conference office form an administrative board which coordinates the conference's activities between its plenary sessions. The Conference mandates a Secretariat to Coordinate Conference activities. The Secretariate is made up of Departments (such as the Justice and Peace department), Offices (such as the AIDS Office) and Associate Bodies (such as the Denis Hurley Peace Institute (DHPI). It has a 51% share in the region's only Catholic weekly newspaper, \"The Southern Cross\". ==Presidents== {| class=\"wikitable\" !| President || Period |- | Archbishop Denis Hurley || 1952\u20131961 |- | Archbishop (later Cardinal) Owen McCann || 1961\u20131974 |- | Archbishop Joseph Fitzgerald || 1974\u20131981 |- | Archbishop Denis Hurley || 1981\u20131987 |- | Bishop Reginald Orsmond || 1987\u20131988 |- | Bishop (later Archbishop) Wilfrid Napier || 1988\u20131994 |- | Bishop Louis Ndlovu || 1994\u20132003 |- | Cardinal Wilfrid Napier || 2003\u20132006 |- | Archbishop Buti Tlhagale || 2007\u20132013 |- | Archbishop Stephen Brislin || 2013\u2013 |} == See also == * Catholic Church in Africa ==References== ==External links== *Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference official website *SACBC webpage.
