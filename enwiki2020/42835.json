    "text": "In grammar, the elative case (abbreviated ; from Latin efferre \"to bring or carry out\") is a locative grammatical case with the basic meaning \"out of\". ==Usage== ===Uralic languages=== In Finnish, the elative is typically formed by adding \"sta/st\u00e4\", in Estonian by adding \"-st\" to the genitive stem and \"-\u00f5st\" in Livonian. In Hungarian, the suffix \"-b\u00f3l/-b\u0151l\" expresses the elative: \"talosta\" - \"out of the house, from the house\" (Finnish \"talo\" = \"house\") \"majast\" - \"out of the house, from the house\" (Estonian \"maja\" = \"house\") \"h\u00e1zb\u00f3l\" - \"out of the house\" (Hungarian \"h\u00e1z\" = \"house\") In some dialects of colloquial Finnish it is common to drop the final vowel of the elative ending, which then becomes identical to the elative morpheme of Estonian; for example: \"talost\". ===Russian=== In some rare cases the elative still exists in contemporary Russian, though it was used more widely in 17-18th cc. texts: \u0438\u0301\u0437 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0443 (out of the forest), \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0438\u0301\u0437 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0443 (blood from the nose), \u0438\u0437 \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0432\u043b\u044e (from Yaroslavl). ==See also== Other locative cases are: *Inessive case (\"in\") *Illative case (\"into\") *Adessive case (\"on\") *Allative case (\"onto\") *Ablative case (\"off\") *Delative case (\"off of a surface\") ==Further reading== * * Category:Grammatical cases ",
