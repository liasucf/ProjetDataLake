His breakthrough came two years later, in 2006, when he won the national road race championships. This year was his breakout year, also winning Birkebeinerrittet, a Norwegian long-distance mountain-bike cycling race. In August 2009, Nordhaug scored a second overall finish on the Tour of Ireland while riding for UCI Continental team . This race was a three-stage event classified as 2.1. His victory in the undulating last stage carried him to that placing, after he got the best of breakaway companion Russell Downing, who won the general classification. ===Team Sky (2010\u201312)=== After a week of rumours, it was announced on 10 September 2009 that Nordhaug would be joining from the 2010 season, along with fellow Norwegians Edvald Boasson Hagen and Kurt Asle Arvesen. Nordhaug spent the 2010 and 2011 seasons working mainly as a domestique, riding the Ardennes classics and the 2011 Giro d'Italia. He signed a new contract with Sky at the end of 2011. Nordhaug competing in the 2012 Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr\u00e9al Nordhaug took his first victory for Sky at the 2012 Trofeo Dei\u00e0, the third race at the Vuelta a Mallorca. He shook off the last contenders on the last difficulty of the day, before descending solo and crossing the line in Dei\u00e0, registering his first victory since 2009. He also rode a good Crit\u00e9rium International event in Corsica, finishing fourth overall behind a strong podium composed of Cadel Evans (), Pierrick F\u00e9drigo () and his teammate Michael Rogers. Nordhaug led Sky at the Tour of the Basque Country, where he came sixth overall. His promising early season form saw him take a prominent role in the team's Ardennes classics squad. Nordhaug was well placed in the closing stages of the Amstel Gold Race but crashed out in the final of the finishing climb, the Cauberg, after clashing wheels with 's Damiano Cunego. Nordhaug was not selected for the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and instead rode the Danmark Rundt, where he won the third stage, to take the overall lead in the race. He took his biggest career victory to that point at the 2012 Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr\u00e9al, winning a sprint from a group of four riders after his solo attack was caught in the closing stages of the race. ===Belkin (2013\u201314)=== In August 2012, Nordhaug announced that he would leave at the end of the 2012 season, and would join on a two-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. === Return to Sky (2015\u201316) === Nordhaug at the 2015 Tour de Suisse At the 2014 UCI Road World Championships, Nordhaug confirmed that he would be leaving . Team Sky later announced that he would be rejoining the team from 1 January 2015. He made history at the 2015 Tour de Yorkshire, winning the inaugural stage of the new race from a breakaway of five riders. With that move, he took the leader's jersey and the points jersey, neither of which he would relinquish, to become the first winner of the race. This was also the first stage race won by Nordhaug outside his native Norway. ==Major results== ;2004 : 1st 20px Cross-country, National Mountain Bike Championships ;2005 : 1st 20px Road race, National Under-23 Road Championships : 5th Overall Ringerike GP ;2006 : 1st 20px Road race, National Road Championships : 1st Birkebeinerrittet ;2007 : 1st Gj\u00f8vik GP : 4th Overall Ringerike GP : 5th Overall Paris\u2013Corr\u00e8ze ;2008 : 1st 20px Cross-country, National Mountain Bike Championships : 1st 20px Overall Festningsrittet ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 2 & 3 : 2nd Overall GP Borremans Viane : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships : 3rd Overall Kalas Cup Trophy : 7th Overall Tour of Ireland : 7th Sparkassen Giro Bochum : 8th Overall Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Is\u00e8re Tour ::1st 20px Mountains classification : 9th Overall Ringerike GP ;2009 : 2nd Overall Tour of Ireland ::1st Stage 3 : 4th Overall Tour de Normandie ::1st Stage 5 : 5th Overall Ringerike GP ;2010 : 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Tour of Qatar : 9th Oslo Grand Prix ;2011 : 1st T\u00f8nsberg Cyclo-cross : 6th Coppa Sabatini ;2012 : 1st Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr\u00e9al : 1st Trofeo Dei\u00e0 : National Road Championships ::2nd Road race ::3rd Time trial : 3rd Overall Tour of Norway : 4th Overall Crit\u00e9rium International : 6th Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 10th Overall Danmark Rundt ::1st Stage 3 ;2013 : 1st 20px National Cyclo-cross Championships : 1st 20px Mountains classification Arctic Race of Norway : 2nd Overall Tour des Fjords : 8th Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr\u00e9al ;2014 : 3rd Overall Arctic Race of Norway ::1st Stage 1 ;2015 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Yorkshire ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stage 1 : 10th Overall Tour of Norway ;2016 : 6th Overall Tour de Yorkshire : 9th Strade Bianche ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian male cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Norway Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Cross-country mountain bikers Category:Sportspeople from T\u00f8nsberg Category:Norwegian mountain bikers Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists ",
