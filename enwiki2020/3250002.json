During the Munsinger Affair, a 1966 sex scandal involving former federal Minister of Defence Pierre S\u00e9vigny, Zolf showed up on S\u00e9vigny's doorstep in pursuit of the story, and S\u00e9vigny promptly hit Zolf over the head with his cane. In 1970, Zolf covered the October Crisis in Quebec for the CBC. In October 1971, Zolf invited feminist Germaine Greer and anti-abortion politician Joe Borowski on his program to discuss the emergence of second-wave feminism. During the program, however, Zolf launched his own attack on Greer, accusing her of \"ignoring ethnic and class differences among women.\" Greer responded by accusing him of fabricating sections of her book (The Female Eunuch, in fact, contained no \"section\" on truck drivers) and told him, \"I never suggested any such thing. I cannot have you sitting here distorting my book for the people who are foolish enough to think that you know about things.\"\"Germaine Greer vs. Larry Zolf\". cbc.ca.
