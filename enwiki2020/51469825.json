    "text": "From Keflav\u00edk, With Love is a retrospective anthology issued in 2001 by Big Beat Records consisting of twenty songs by Thor's Hammer (Hlj\u00f3mar), a 1960s garage rock and beat group from Iceland who were one of the best-known Icelandic groups during the era. Though they worked with different producers on various labels, Thor's Hammer sound is best-typified by the tough, aggressive fuzz-drenched rockers they recorded in London for Parlophone Records in 1966, such as \"I Don't Care,\" \"My Life,\" \"Better Days,\" and \"The Big Beat Country Dance\", and \"If You Knew\". While the lyrics to most of their songs were sung in English, several tracks were recorded in their native Icelandic, such as \"Fyrsti Kossinn\", \"Ef H\u00fan Er N\u00e1l\u00e6gt M\u00e9r\", and \"Ertu Med\", which was covered by the Savages on their Live 'n Wild album. Some of the tracks from Thor's Hammer's final period in the late 1960s, such as \"Stay\", show the group stretching their sound stylistically, augmenting certain arrangements with keyboards and horns. At his time, Thor's Hammer moved into a more eclectic direction, but they broke up in 1969, with several of their members going on to join the progressive rock group, Trubrot. ==Track listing== #\"If You Knew\" 2:25 #\"I Don't Care\" 2:43 #\"Better Days\" 2:41 #\"By the Sea\" 2:00 #\"The Big Beat Country Dance\" 2:00 #\"Love Enough\" 3:07 #\"My Life\" 2:21 #\"A Memory\" 2:39 #\"Once\" 3:19 #\"Fyrsti Kossinn\" 2:11 #\"Ef H\u00fan Er N\u00e1l\u00e6gt M\u00e9r\" 2:09 #\"Show Me You Like Me\" 3:10 #\"Minningin Um Thig\" 3:04 #\"Ertu Med\" 2:34 #\"Kv\u00f6ld Vid Keflavik\" 2:23 #\"Stay\" 2:26 #\"By the Sea\" 2:33 #\"Heyrdu Mig G\u00f3da\" 2:35 #\"Thu Og \u00c9g\" 3:09 #\"Midsumarn\u00f3tt\" 4:08 ==Catalogue and release information== *From Keflav\u00edk, With Love (Big Beat CDWIKD 206, 2001) ==References== Category:2001 compilation albums Category:Garage rock compilation albums Category:Psychedelic rock compilation albums Category:Beat music albums ",
