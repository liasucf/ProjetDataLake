    "text": "SSV Ulm 1846 is a German football club from Ulm, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The modern-day football department, officially playing as SSV Ulm 1846 Fussball, was formed on 9 March 2009 when the department separated from SSV Ulm 1846. The club's greatest success has been promotion to the Bundesliga in 1998\u201399, where it played for just one season. Ulm has also spent eight seasons in the 2. Bundesliga between 1979\u201380 and 2000\u201301. ==History== The older of the two predecessor sides was founded on 12 April 1846 as Turnerbund Ulm. They had an on-again, off-again relationship with Turnverein Ulm through the 1850s. The football department became independent in 1926 as Ulmer Rasensport Verein and in 1939 would merge with Ulmer Fu\u00dfball Verein, and their old clubmates in TB Ulm and TV Ulm, to form TSG Ulm 1846. In 1968, RSVgg Ulm became part of TSG Ulm 1846. 1\\. Schwimm- und Sportverein Ulm was formed in 1928.

Throughout this time the club played in local competition before joining the Gauliga W\u00fcrttemberg, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the 1933 reorganisation of German football under the Third Reich, for the 1939\u201340 season. The club played there until the end of World War II. After the war they began play in the 2. Oberliga S\u00fcd (II) and did well enough to make occasional advances to the Oberliga S\u00fcd (I) for short stays before falling back again. In 1963, with the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new top- flight professional league, TSG Ulm 1846 found itself in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (II) for a couple of seasons before slipping to tier III and IV level play. In 1968, RSVgg Ulm became part of TSG Ulm 1846. ===1. SSV Ulm=== 1\\. Spiel- und Sportverein Ulm was formed in 1928 and, after two seasons in the Bezirksliga Bayern, joined the Gauliga W\u00fcrttemberg in 1933, well before their future partner, where they earned just mid-table finishes. After the war and leading up to their union with TSG 1846, they played as a third or fourth division side. Finally, in 1970, 1. SSV Ulm merged with TSG 1846 to form SSV Ulm 1846. ===SSV Ulm 1846=== At the time of the merger. both clubs were playing football in the tier III Amateurliga W\u00fcrttemberg and would continue to do so for a nearly a decade. In 1980, the combined side advanced to the 2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd and would spend six of the next ten years playing at that level where, except for a fifth-place finish in 1982, their results were well down the table. After another decade in the level III Amateur Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Regionalliga S\u00fcd, 1846 made an unexpected breakthrough after just one season in the 2. Bundesliga with a third-place finish that led to the club's promotion to the top-flight Bundesliga for the 1999\u20132000 season. Even though the issue was not decided until the last day of the season, Ulm could do no better than a sixteenth-place finish and returned to the second division. The 2000\u201301 season was an unqualified disaster for the club: they could manage only another sixteenth-place finish and were sent back down to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III). They were then denied a licence over the chaotic state of their finances which plunged the club down to the fifth tier Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg. Afterwards Ulm worked their way back, to the Oberliga Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg (IV) in 2002, and the Regionalliga in 2008. ===SSV Ulm 1846 Fu\u00dfball=== Following the 2009 European football betting scandal, the club released three allegedly involved players, Davor Kraljevi\u0107, Marijo Marinovi\u0107 and Dinko Radojevi\u0107. In January 2011, the club was declared insolvent, and the results of the 2010\u201311 season were declared void. The club was relegated to the Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg but immediately won the 2011\u201312 title, finishing nine points clear of second-placed VfR Mannheim and earning promotion to the new Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest. In May 2014, SSV Ulm 1846 was once again close to insolvency, for the third time in 13 years, requiring \u20ac420,000 in financial support before the end of the month to ensure survival. The club eventually entered administration and was relegated back to the Oberliga. After two seasons, SSV Ulm 1846 was promoted to the Regionalliga in May 2016. ==Honours== ===League=== * German amateur championship ** Champions: 1996 * Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) ** Champions: 1998 * Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (III/IV/V) ** Champions: 1979, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1993, 1994, 2012, 2016 ** Runners-up: 1992, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008 * Amateurliga W\u00fcrttemberg (III) ** Champions: 1946\u2021, 1950\u2021, 1955\u2020, 1972, 1973, 1977, 1978 ** Runners-up: 1956\u2020, 1974 * Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg (V) ** Runners-up: 2002 ===Cup=== * W\u00fcrttemberg Cup (Tiers III-VII) ** Winners: 1957\u2020, 1982, 1983, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2018, 2019, 2020 ** Runners-up: 1976, 1998, 2000\u00a5, 2001\u00a5, 2006, 2007 * \u2021 Won by TSG Ulm 1846. * \u2020 Won by SSV Ulm. * \u00a5 Won by reserve team. ==Recent managers== Recent managers of the club: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" | Manager | Start | Finish |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Dieter M\u00e4rkle | 1 July 2004 | 28 November 2004 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Marcus Sorg | 29 November 2004 | 6 September 2007 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Paul Sauter | 1 July 2007 | 30 June 2008 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Janusz G\u00f3ra | 7 September 2007 | 30 September 2007 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Markus Gisdol | 1 July 2008 | 30 June 2009 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Manfred Paula | 1 July 2009 | 24 September 2009 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Frank Kaspari | 25 September 2009 | 4 October 2009 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Ralf Becker | 15 October 2009 | 1 December 2010 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Janusz G\u00f3ra | 2 December 2010 | 30 June 2011 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Paul Sauter | 1 July 2011 | 30 June 2012 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Stephan Baierl | 1 July 2012 | 13 November 2012 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Paul Sauter | 14 November 2012 | 17 October 2013 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Oliver Uns\u00f6ld | 18 October 2013 | 30 June 2014 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Stephan Baierl | 1 July 2014 | 15 August 2017 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Tobias Flitsch | 17 August 2017 | 30 June 2018 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | Holger Bachthaler | 1 July 2018 | Present |} ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- align=\"center\" | 1999\u20132000 | align=\"left\"| Bundesliga | I | bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"| 16th \u2193 |- align=\"center\" | 2000\u201301 | align=\"left\"| 2.
