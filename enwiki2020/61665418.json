    "text": "The No Remorse Tour, sometimes called No Remorse Death on the Road Tour was a concert tour played by the heavy metal band Mot\u00f6rhead in support of their compilation album, No Remorse. It would be the first tour for the new line up of Phil Campbell, W\u00fcrzel, and Pete Gill. ==Background== Around 1984, Motorhead were beginning to feel that they wished to leave their current record label, Bronze Records, However over two years ensured of legal issues that kept the band from recording an album. On top of this Phil Campbell was still contracted with his previous band, Persian Risk's label, Metal Masters. Drummer Pete Gill was also still in litigation with some money that his previous band, Saxon had owed him. As a result of this, only Lemmy and W\u00fcrzel were able to take credit on the new tracks in No Remorse. As a result, the band decided that for the time being, doing a tour would be good. == Overview == Lemmy expressed that having a completely new line up of members \"took ten years off of me, easy, 'cause they were so excited. The tour saw the band playing shows at Australia and New Zealand for the very first time. On 2 August, at the Shellharbour Club, Motorhead played one of their smallest shows, to a crowd of only 15 people in attendance. During their 2 December show at Cleveland, the band broke the world record for having the loudest show in the world, at 130 decibels beating The Who's previous record by 10 decibels. It was so loud that it cracked the theatre ceiling, sending plaster down onto the crowd below. Eventually a maintenance worker had to shut Motorhead's concert down, before the damage stopped. A man living near the venue was able to record the show from his living room. Around early September, the band took a break to write a couple of songs for what would be their next album Orgasmatron. One of them, \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\", would be added into the setlist after that. About halfway through the UK leg, Wurzel had to step out for a couple of shows due to having kidney stones, so the band simply kept going as a three-piece. During the show at Hammersmith Odeon, he was taken out on a wheelchair and played a couple of songs. On 15 December, Wendy O' Williams made a guest appearance and sung No Class with the band. ==Personnel == *Lemmy Kilmister \u2013 bass guitar, vocals *Phil \"Wizz\u00f6\" Campbell \u2013 guitar *Michael \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston \u2013 guitar *Pete Gill \u2013 drums ==Setlist== #\"Iron Fist\" #\"Stay Clean\" #\"Heart of Stone\" #\"The Hammer\" #\"Metropolis\" #\"Shoot You in the Back\" #\"Jailbait\" #\"Killed by Death\" #\"Ace of Spades\" #\"Steal Your Face\" #\"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" (added on 12 October) #\"(We Are) The Road Crew\" #\"Bite the Bullet\" #\"The Chase Is Better Than the Catch\" #\"No Class\" #\"Motorhead\" Encore # * \"Bomber\" #\"Overkill\" ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; !width=\"150\"|Datehttps://imotorhead.com/tours/?whichYear=1984 !width=\"150\"|City !width=\"125\"|Country !width=\"275\"|Venue !width=\"125\"|Support Act(s)Burridge, Alan Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motorhead Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing .
