The local board's area was reconstituted by the Local Government Act 1894, and became Enfield Urban District.Enfield - Local Government in 'Victoria County History of Middlesex, Vol.5 (British History Online), accessed January 28, 2008 Enfield Urban District Council replaced the local board, and was divided into four wards each returning three councillors: Town, Chase & Bull's Cross, Ordnance and Green Street & Ponders End.Kelly's Directory of Middlesex 1899, p.110 (Historical Directories), accessed January 31, 2008 In 1909 two new wards, Bush Park and Hadley Wood & Cockfosters were formed and the UDC increased to 18 councillors. Kelly's Directory of Middlesex 1914, p.134 (Historical Directories), accessed January 31, 2008 The urban district council successfully petitioned for a charter of incorporation in 1955, becoming a municipal borough, with a corporation consisting of a mayor, ten aldermen and thirty councillors replacing the urban district council. The municipal borough was divided into ten wards, each returning three councillors: Bush Hill Park, Cambridge Road, Chase, Enfield Wash, Green Street, Ordnance, Ponders End, Town, West and Willow. The borough was abolished under the London Government Act 1963 was merged with the Municipal Borough of Southgate and the Municipal Borough of Edmonton to form the London Borough of Enfield on 1 April 1965. The borough included what is now known as Enfield Town, along with other settlements such as Brimsdown, Enfield Wash and Ponders End. The urban district council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms in 1946. This featured an \"enfield\" (a rare heraldic beast) and a green chief with silver and blue wavy bars representing the New River, the Metropolitan Green Belt areas and open spaces. The crest was a stag representing Enfield Chase with a red rose for the Duchy of Lancaster. On incorporation as a borough, the council was eligible for a further grant of supporters, and a stag and an enfield were added on either side of the shield.Civic Heraldry of England and Wales - Enfield Borough Council, accessed January 28, 2008 Much of the same symbolism was carried over to the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield when the London Borough was created. ==References== ==External links== *Enfield Chronology (Enfield Council), accessed January 28, 2008 *Vision of Britain Category:History of the London Borough of Enfield Category:Districts abolished by the London Government Act 1963 Category:Districts of England created by the Local Government Act 1894 Category:Municipal boroughs of England Category:History of local government in Middlesex ",
