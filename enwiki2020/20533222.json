    "text": "Wrestling Wrecks is the 48th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on July 20, 1953, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== Woody is excited to watch the wrestling program, featuring a championship match between the champion, the Great Precious Preacy (who Woody cheers) and the challenger, Bulldozer. Several commercials interrupt the action, annoying Woody, and a dog food ad causes Woody's dog to charge the television, destroying it. With his TV busted, and not content to sit at home, Woody Woodpecker dashes off to the arena to watch the rest of the match. Woody's heckling leads him to assisting Preacy; being used a prop, barbecuing Bulldozer as he's tied in the ropes, and even showing the wrestlers the script they have to follow. Bulldozer eventually sends Preacy to the hospital, leaving an enraged Woody to turn into a matador and Bulldozer playing a bull. After the initial charge, Bulldozer slams into Woody's cape and reveals an anvil behind it. Bulldozer passes out from the pain and after Woody covers him for the pinfall, Woody ends up becoming the new champ. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1953\".
