He was murdered by his own slaves, supposedly on account of his sexual appetites. ==Life== Hostius Quadra lived during the reign of the emperor Augustus. \u2033The profligate nature of Hostius Quadra\u2019s sexual enthusiasm was such that it led to his murder at the hands of his disgusted slaves.\u2033P. Toohey, Melancholy, Love, and Time: Boundaries of the Self in Ancient Literature, p. 261. ==References in Seneca's Naturales Quaestiones== Hostius Quadra is known through references made by Seneca in his Naturales quaestiones. > Hostius fuit Quadra, obscenitatis in scaenam usque productae. Hunc diuitem > auarum, sestertii milies seruum, diuus Augustus indignum uindicta iudicauit, > cum a seruis occisus esset, et tantum non pronuntiauit iure caesum videri. > Non erat ille ab uno tantummodo sexu impurus, sed tam uirorum quam feminarum > auidus fuit, fecitque specula huius notae, cuius modo rettuli, imagines > longe maiores reddentia, in quibus digitus brachii mensuram et crassitudinem > excederet.
