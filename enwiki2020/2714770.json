The term, which is used in the hadeeth of the Hadith, is \"Nisf Shaban\" or \"lilatun nisafi min Shaban\" or \"night of mid Shaban\". It has been said in a Hadith, Another Hadith says, According to different Saheeh Hadith, Muhammad used to perform fasting in this month. Sha'aban's fast was the most loved of him.

This tradition is rarely followed in Indonesia, but it is widely followed in Aceh, West Sumatra and South Kalimantan. In South Asia, Muslims make sweets (especially Halwa or Zarda) to be given to the neighbors and the poor on the evening prior to the 15th of Sha'ban.
