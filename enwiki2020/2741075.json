    "text": "Chayyim ( ', Classical Hebrew: , Israeli Hebrew: ), also transcribed Haim, Hayim, Chayim, or Chaim (English pronunciations: , , ), is a name of Hebrew origin which means \"life\". Its first usage can be traced to the Middle Ages. It is a popular name among Jewish people. The feminine form for this name is Chaya ( ', Classical Hebrew: , Israeli Hebrew: ; English pronunciations: , ). Chai is the Hebrew word for \"alive\". According to Kaballah, the name Hayim helps the person to remain healthy, and people were known to add Hayim as their second name to improve their health. In the United States, Chaim is a common spelling; however, since the phonemic pattern is unusual for English words, Hayim is often used as an alternative spelling. The \"ch\" spelling comes from transliteration of the Hebrew letter \"chet\", which also starts words like Chanukah, Channa, etc., which can also be spelled as Hanukah and Hannah. It is cognate to the Arabic word ('), with the same meaning, deriving from the same Proto-Semitic root. L'Chaim in Hebrew is a toast meaning \"to life\". When a couple becomes engaged, they get together with friends and family to celebrate. Since they drink l'chaim (\"to life\"), the celebration is also called a l'chaim. Hebrew letters are also used as numerals, and the Hebrew letters that spell \"chai\" also stand for the number 18. Thus, 18 is considered a lucky number in Jewish culture. It is common to give gifts and contributions to charity in multiples of 18. Among Argentine Jews, the Spanish name Jaime (, a Spanish cognate of James) is often chosen for its phonetic similarity to Haim. Hayim is a non-governmental organization that works on a voluntary basis to provide relief and support for pediatric oncology patients in Israel. ==People with the given name Haim== Notable people with the name include: * Haim Arlosoroff (1899\u20131933), Zionist politician * Chaim ibn Attar (1696\u20131743), the Or Hachaim * Haim Bar-Lev (1924-1994), Israeli military officer and government minister * Haim Ben-Shahar, Israeli economist and President of Tel Aviv University * Chaim Bloom (born 1983), American Chief Baseball Officer for the Boston Red Sox * Chaim Deutsch, New York City Council Member * Chaim Elata, professor emeritus of mechanical engineering and President of Ben- Gurion University of the Negev, and Chairman of the Israel Public Utility Authority for Electricity * Hyam Greenbaum, founder of the BBC Television Orchestra * Chaim (Harvey) Hames (born 1966), professor of history and Rector at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev * Haim Harari (born 1940), Israeli theoretical physicist; President of the Weizmann Institute of Science * Chaim Herzog (1918\u20131997), Israeli president * Chaim Koppelman (1920\u20132009), American printmaker * Hyam Maccoby (1924\u20132004), British scholar * Chaim Hezekiah Medini (1834\u20131904), the Sdei Chemed \u2013 Talmudic scholar and halachist * Haim Palachi (or Palagi, 1788\u20131868), Torah scholar * Hyam Plutzik (1911\u20131962), English poet and academic * Chaim Potok (1929\u20132002), American Jewish author * Haim Revivo (born 1972), Israeli former international footballer * J.
