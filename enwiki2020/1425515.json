Currently, there are six Bobcat teams competing in U Sports as members of the Canada West Universities Athletic Association while the Bobcat soccer teams participate in the Manitoba Colleges Athletic Conference. ==History== Originally known as the Caps and Cappettes, Brandon University Athletics adopted the nickname Bobcats in 1969. Brandon University Athletics once fielded teams in football, field hockey, tennis, badminton, judo, swimming, and ice hockey. The men's ice hockey team ceased in 2002. Brandon College and Brandon University athletes competed in the Western Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1920 until it was split into two divisions in 1971, at which time the Bobcats joined the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Following the 1998 season, GPAC merged with the Canada West conference, the conference in which the Bobcats have been competing since. ==Teams== ===Men's Basketball=== *Coach: Gil Cheung *Assistant Coach: Brett Nohr *Assistant Coach: Keith Van Walleghem *Assistant Coach: Kevin Phillip *National Championships: 1987, 1988, 1989, 1996 *Canada West Championships: 2002 *GPAC Championships: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 The Bobcats men's basketball team is a 4-time Canadian University national championship winner, and one of only two Canadian universities to win three-consecutive men's basketball national championships.

The Bobcats entered the tournament ranked #1 before beating the UBC Thunderbirds 74-66 in the gold medal final. At the 1988 national championship tournament, the Bobcats defeated the Western Mustangs in the semi-final thanks to 21 points and seven rebounds from Partick Jebbison, before beating the Acadia Axemen 81-68 in the gold medal game on March 20, 1988. The Bobcats successfully made it three national championships in a row in 1989. Entering the tournament ranked #1, the Bobcats beat the Toronto Varsity Blues 85-73 in the semi-final behind 18 second-half points from Joey Vickery before Brandon beat the Victoria Vikes 74-73. In 1996 the Bobcats made it back to the national championship final after wins over the Acadia Axemen and Toronto Varsity Blues, setting up a gold medal game against the University of Alberta Golden Bears. The Bobcats were led by fifth-year forward Keith Vassell as he helped the Bobcats to a 79-72 win in what would be his final game after an outstanding playing career. In the 1999/2000 season the Bobcats were silver medal winners after dropping the final to St. Francis Xavier X-Men in a hard- fought 61-60 loss. The following year saw a rematch of the previous year's national championship final between Brandon and St. Francis Xavier.

The Bobcats have made the Canada West playoffs every year since the 2007-2008 season. The Bobcats have qualified for the U Sports national championship tournament twice. The first appearance was in 2009 where they earned a bronze medal. In 2011, the Bobcats earned a spot in their first ever national championship final. They dropped a hard-fought match to eventual winner Trinity Western Spartans at their home gym. For the 2012-13 season, the Bobcats finished in sixth place in the regular season with a 13-9 record, but excelled in the playoffs and won their first Canada West championship in a victory over the Manitoba Bisons. The team advanced to the 2013 national championships where they finished with a bronze medal after defeating the Western Mustangs. In 2019, they took home the Canada West championship, their second conference title, beating Trinity Western three sets to two.

Records show Brandon College having both men's and women's hockey teams as early as 1910. Arguably the most successful ice hockey program was under head coach (and former player) Andy Murray, who in the 1980-1981 season led the Bobcats to a 23-1 regular season record, a No. 1 national ranking and a berth in the national championship.
