    "text": "Lam\u00e8ch is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the southwest of the prominent crater Eudoxus, at the eastern edge of the Montes Caucasus range. It was named after French selenographer F\u00e9lix Chemla Lam\u00e8ch. This is a circular, bowl-shaped formation. The inner walls slope down to a small central floor that is about one-fourth the diameter of the crater. This formation is not notably eroded, and contains no other features of interest. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
