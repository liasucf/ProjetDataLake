    "text": "Mu\u011fla Province (, ) is a province of Turkey, at the country's south-western corner, on the Aegean Sea. Its seat is Mu\u011fla, about inland, while some of Turkey's largest holiday resorts, such as Bodrum, \u00d6l\u00fcdeniz, Marmaris and Fethiye, are on the coast in Mu\u011fla. ==Etymology== The original name of Mu\u011fla is open for discussion. Various sources refer to the city as Mogola, Mobella or Mobolia. ==Geography== At , Mu\u011fla's coastline is the longest among the Provinces of Turkey and longer than many countries' coastlines, (even without taking any small islands into account). Important is the Dat\u00e7a Peninsula. As well as the sea, Mu\u011fla has two large lakes, Lake Bafa in the district of Milas and Lake K\u00f6yce\u011fiz. The landscape consists of pot-shaped small plains surrounded by mountains, formed by depressions in the Neogene. These include the plain of the city of Mu\u011fla itself, Ye\u015filyurt, Ula, G\u00fcla\u011fz\u0131, Yerkesik, Akkaya, and Yenice). Until the recent building of highways, transport from these plains to either the coast or inland was quite arduous, and thus each locality remained an isolated culture of its own. Contact with the outside world was through one of the three difficult passes: northwest to Milas, north to the Menderes plain through G\u00f6kbel, or northeast to Tavas. The economy of Mu\u011fla relies mainly on tourism (on the coast), and agriculture, forestry and marble quarries inland. Coast in Mu\u011fla province (near Dalaman). Typical Mu\u011fla coastal scene. Typical Mu\u011fla inland landscape. Agriculture in Mu\u011fla is rich and varied; the province is one of Turkey's largest producers of honey, pine- forest honey in particular and citrus fruits are grown in Ortaca, Fethiye, Dalaman and Dalyan. The province is the second center of marble industry in Turkey after Afyonkarahisar in terms of quantity, variety and quality. Other mineral exploitation includes coal-mining in Yata\u011fan and chrome in Fethiye. Other industry in the province includes the SEKA paper mill in Dalaman, However Mu\u011fla is by no means an industrialised province. ===Environment=== Despite court decisions upheld by the ECHR, , Yata\u011fan, Yenik\u00f6y and Kemerk\u00f6y coal-fired power stations continue to pollute. ===Transportation=== The following are aspects about transportation in Mu\u011fla province: * There are two airports in Dalaman and Milas-Bodrum, serving domestic and international flights and catering to the tourism industry. * There are yacht marinas in Bodrum, Marmaris, Fethiye and G\u00fcll\u00fck. * There are many privately run bus connections to \u0130zmir, Antalya, Ankara, Istanbul and other major cities in Turkey from Mu\u011fla and directly from the coastal resorts. ==History== In ancient times in Anatolia, the region between the Menderes (Meander) and Dalaman (Indus) rivers in the south was called Caria. The inhabitants were Carians and Leleges. In his Iliad, Homer describes the Carians as natives of Anatolia, defending their country against Greeks in joint campaigns in collaboration with the Trojans. A major city of ancient Caria, Mu\u011fla is known to have been occupied by raiding parties of Egyptians, Assyrians and Scythians, until eventually the area was settled by Ancient Greek colonists. The Greeks inhabited this coast for a long time building prominent cities, such as Knidos (at the end of the Dat\u00e7a Peninsula) and Bodrum (Halicarnassos), as well as many smaller towns along the coast, on the Bodrum Peninsula and inland, including in the district of Fethiye the cities of Telmessos, Xanthos, Patara and Tlos. Eventually the coast was conquered by Persians who were in turn removed by Alexander the Great, bringing an end to the satrapy of Caria. In 1261, Menteshe Bey, founder of the Beylik (principality) that carried his name, with its capital in Milas and nearby Be\u00e7in, established his rule over the region of Mu\u011fla as well. The beys of Menteshe held the city until 1390 and this, the first Turkish state in the region, achieved a high level of cultural development, its buildings remaining to this day. The province also became a significant naval power, trading with the Aegean Islands, Crete and as far as Venice and Egypt. Turkish settlement during the Menteshe period usually took place through migrations along the K\u00fctahya-Tavas axis. In 1390, Mu\u011fla was taken over by the Ottoman Empire. However, just twelve years later, Tamerlane and his forces defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara, and returned control of the region to its former rulers, the Menteshe Beys, as he did for other Anatolian beyliks. Mu\u011fla was brought back under Ottoman control by Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror, in 1451. One of the most important events in the area during the Ottoman period was the well-recorded campaign of S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent against Rhodes, which was launched from Marmaris. === Archaeology === With this long history Mu\u011fla is rich in ancient ruins, with over 100 excavated sites including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Letoon, near Fethiye. In 2018, archaeologists unearthed a 2,300-year-old rock sepulchre of an ancient Greek boxer called Diagoras of Rhodes on a hill in the Turgut village, Mu\u011fla province, Marmaris. This unusual pyramid tomb was considered to belong to a holy person by the local people. The shrine, used as a pilgrimage by locals until the 1970s, also has the potential to be the only pyramid grave in Turkey. Excavation team also discovered an inscription with these words: \u201cI will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave\". ==Notable people== The following are notable residents of Mu\u011fla province: * Herodotus of Halicarnassos, historian * Turgut Reis Seaman * Basil Zaharoff, Arms dealer born in Mu\u011fla * Osman Hamdi Bey Painter had his summer residence in Yata\u011fan * \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Kaya, Minister of the Interior under Atat\u00fcrk, born in \u0130stank\u00f6y * Mustafa Mu\u011flal\u0131, Turkish War of Independence general * Yunus Nadi Abal\u0131o\u011flu, Founder of Cumhuriyet newspaper and key supporter of Atat\u00fcrk, from Fethiye * Zihni Derin, Agriculturalist responsible for planting tea in the Eastern Black Sea region, from Mu\u011fla * Necati \u00c7iller, father of Prime Minister Tansu \u00c7iller, governor of Istanbul in the 1950s, from Milas * Cevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131, writer of The \"Fisherman of Halicarnasoss\" and his student \u015eadan G\u00f6koval\u0131 * Nail \u00c7ak\u0131rhan, architect of the Akyaka \u00c7ak\u0131rhan houses and winner of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture * Janet Aky\u00fcz Mattei Amateur astronomer and president of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), of Bodrum. * Zeki M\u00fcren, Singer and fixture of the Bodrum nightclub scene for many years * Poet Can Y\u00fccel is buried in Dat\u00e7a, his home in his final years * Former President Kenan Evren lived in Marmaris after he retired until his death. ==Districts== thumb == Politics == The Republican People's Party (CHP), Turkey's principal center- left party has a traditionally strong presence across the political landscape of Mu\u011fla Province, closely followed by the traditional center-right represented by the Democrat Party (DP) in Turkey's politics, although the incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP) obtained the first place in the ballots cast during the last national-scale elections that were the 2004 local elections, with 31,25% of the votes.
