Conceived in 1996 and launched on June 10, 1997, Cathedral is a work in music and art which depicts five \"mystical moments in time\": The building of the Great Pyramid in Giza, the building of Chartres Cathedral, the 19th century Native American Ghost Dance movement, the detonation of the atomic bomb, and the creation of the World Wide Web.Kozinn, Allan. \"William Duckworth, internet composer, dies at 69.\" New York Times 22 Sept. 2012: B8(L).

More recently, Cathedral has served as the site for the distribution of The iPod Opera 2.0: The Myth of Orpheus, the Chronicler and Eurydice, podcast in 26 episodes as MP3 and QuickTime video files. The video episodes may be downloaded and played on many different kinds of computer systems, including Apple OS, Windows and Linux computers, while the MP3 files may be downloaded and burned as an audio disk. The completion of the podcast in February 2007 was timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first performance of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.Kozinn Cathedral features an instrument called the PitchWeb, which allows anyone with a computer to play along with the Cathedral Band when the band is performing live over the Internet. Duckworth plays the PitchWeb on a laptop computer when the band performs live.Kozinn Cathedral was conceived during a conversation Duckworth had with his wife, Nora Farrell, a software designer who specializes in music and publishing web applications. Farrell collaborated with Duckworth on Cathedral and elements of it such as \"The iPod Opera 2.0.\" As a member of the Cathedral Band, she edits the PitchWeb contributions by outside musicians. A chapter in Duckworth's 2005 book, Virtual Music: How the Web Got Wired for Sound, discusses the Cathedral site. ==References== ==Further reading== *Gillespie, Don C. 2001. \"Duckworth, William (Ervin)\".
