    "text": "In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach (L\u00f3egaire the Victorious) is a hapless Ulster warrior who mainly functions as comic relief. When he, C\u00fachulainn and Conall Cernach contend for the champion's portion at Briccriu's feast, L\u00f3egaire is always a distant third. He lived at Inber Seimne (Larne, county Antrim). His death-tale sums him up. When the poet Aed was to be drowned in a lake near L\u00f3egaire's house for adultery with Conchobar's wife Mugain, he cried for help and L\u00f3egaire rushed to the rescue. As he leaped out the door, he knocked the top of his own head off on the lintel. Still, he managed to kill thirty soldiers and save Aed's life before he died. ==Texts== *Bricriu's Feast *The Death of L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach ==References== Category:Ulster Cycle ",
