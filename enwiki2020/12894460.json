    "text": "Macrozamia macdonnellii, common name MacDonnell Ranges Cycad, is a species of plant in the family Zamiaceae. It is endemic to the Northern Territory, Australia. Macrozamia macdonnellii is not eaten by the Arrernte people of the Macdonnell Ranges due to the extensive process of toxin leaching that is required. ==Description== Macrozamia macdonnellii has large, frond-like pinnate bluish-green leaves which radiate from the top of a stocky trunk. The male and female reproductive cones are on separate plants, with the female cone being broader than the male and partially enclosing seeds the size of an egg which have a bright red outer layer (sarcotesta). ==Taxonomy== It was first named Encephalartos macdonnellii by Ferdinand von Mueller, and published by Miquel in Over de Cycadeen in Nieuw-Holland. Verslagen en Mededeelingen van de afdeeling Natuurkunde in 1863.Miquel, F.A.W. (1863) Over de Cycadeen in Nieuw-Holland. Verslagen en Mededeelingen van de afdeeling Natuurkunde, Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen 15: 376. In 1868, Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle reassigned it to the genus,Macrozamia, thereby giving it the name, Macrozamia macdonnellii. ==References== ==External links== *FloraNT Northern Territory Flora online: Macrozamia macdonnellii. macdonnellii Category:Endemic flora of Australia Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Cycadophyta of Australia Category:Least concern flora of Australia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Plants described in 1868 Category:Taxa named by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle ",
