    "text": "Mundrabilla is in a very sparsely populated area in the far south east of Western Australia. The two significant features are Mundrabilla Roadhouse and Mundrabilla Station which are approximately apart. At the 2016 census, Mundrabilla had a population of 23, 32% male and 68% female. The time zone in use is UTC+8:45. https://www.howderfamily.com/blog/australias-weird-little- time-zone/ ==Mundrabilla Roadhouse== Mundrabilla Roadhouse was built by Mr Roger Warren-Langford and Mrs Pat Warren-Langford who initially managed Mundrabilla Station. It is now a small roadhouse community located on the Eyre Highway in Western Australia, on the Roe Plains (at a lower level and south of the Nullarbor Plain), west of Eucla and about north of the Great Australian Bight. ==Mundrabilla Station== Mundrabilla Station (), the first sheep station in the Nullarbor region, was established by William Stuart McGill (a Scotsman) and Thomas and William Kennedy (two Irishmen) in 1872. Thomas Kennedy died in 1896. McGill's first wife Annie Harkness (n\u00e9e Crawford) died in childbirth in 1879. Annie McGill and Thomas Kennedy are both buried on Mundrabilla Station. McGill remarried Ellen Angel Fairweather of Adelaide in 1889. ==Climate== Mundrabilla has a typical arid climate; however it is cooler in summer than much of the Australian desert due to its proximity to the ocean. Despite this, Mundrabilla Station still holds the record for the equal 4th hottest temperature in Australia, recorded on 3 January 1979. ==Present day== Like other locations in the Nullarbor Plain area, the area consists of nothing more than a roadhouse, open 06:00 to 9.30pm each day. The roadhouse includes a small wildlife park with emus, camels and an aviary. Pastoral activities continue in the area. ==Mundrabilla Iron Meteorite== The Mundrabilla Meteorite, the largest meteorite found in Australia, weighing 12.4 tonnes, was found by geologists R.B. Wilson and A.M. Cooney during a geological survey at Mundrabilla in 1966, and forms one half of the \"Mundrabilla Mass\". The next largest fragment weighs 5.08 tonnes. In all, 22 tonnes of fragments have been recovered, spread over a 60 km range making it one of the largest meteorite sites in the world. The fragments fell to Earth at least one million years ago. ==References== ==External links== *Shire of Dundas \u2013 Towns of the Eyre Highway *Nullarbor Net \u2013 Mundrabilla including local information.
