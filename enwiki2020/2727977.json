It is situated near the ecliptic and thus is subject to lunar occultation. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.43, which is near the lower threshold of visibility to the naked eye. Anybody attempting to view the object is likely to instead see the Asterope pair as a single elongated form of magnitude 5.6. Based upon an annual parallax shift of , this star is located 444 light years away from the Sun. It is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +7 km/s. This is an ordinary A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 Vn. The 'n' suffix indicates the spectrum displays \"nebulous\" absorption lines due to rapid rotation. This is confirmed by a high projected rotational velocity of 232 km/s. The star is radiating six times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 11,817 K. ==References== Category:A-type main-sequence stars Category:Pleiades Open Cluster Category:Taurus (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects Tauri, 022 023441 017588 1152 Sterope II ",
