    "text": "Sonia Robertson (born 2 June 1947 in Burnham Market) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Her identical twin sister Sandra Chick was one of her teammates in the capital of the Soviet Union, and both are the first twin gold medalists in hockey. Because of a boycott by western European, Australasian and other countries, the Women's Field Hockey Tournament contained fewer teams than normal. A late request was sent to the government of Zimbabwe, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games. ==References== *sports-reference Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Burnham Market Category:British emigrants to Rhodesia Category:Zimbabwean female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Zimbabwe Category:Field hockey players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Zimbabwe Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Twin sportspeople Category:Twin people from Zimbabwe Category:Zimbabwean people of English descent Category:White Zimbabwean sportspeople ",
