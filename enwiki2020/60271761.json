She founded the Swabian league for bird protection in Germany which would later merge into what became the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU). == Early life and career == H\u00e4hnle was born in Sulz am Neckar. Her father Johannes H\u00e4hnle was a salt works inspector. The family moved to Rottweil, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall and then T\u00fcbingen. She married her cousin Hans H\u00e4hnle who ran a factory in Giengen an der Brenz. She volunteered as the chairperson of the newly formed bird protection union Bundes f\u00fcr Vogelschutz (BfV) in 1899 which was based on the system followed in Austria. She helped popularize bird conservation through lectures and other efforts. One of the supporters of the organization was Robert Bosch of Albeck, not far from Giengen. They were also supported by Protestant theologians from T\u00fcbingen. By 1899 the organization had 3,500 members in W\u00fcrttemberg alone. This would later become a much bigger organization, the Naturschutzbund Deutschland. ==References== Category:German conservationists Category:Women conservationists Category:People from Sulz am Neckar Category:1851 births Category:1941 deaths ",
