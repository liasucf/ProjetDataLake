The ship had originally been laid down in 1907 for the Ottoman Navy and was to have been named Drama, and was based on the Ottoman cruiser . She had not been completed by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and so she was seized by the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) and was completed in 1913. The ship was armed with two and eight guns, and was capable of a top speed of over . Libia had a relatively uneventful career. Before Italy's entry into World War I, she was involved in the evacuation of Prince William, the ruler of Albania, from Durazzo in late 1914. Following Italy's declaration of war in May 1915, Libia patrolled the Otranto Barrage but did not see action. In 1921\u20131922, she went on a world tour, during which she was featured in a short documentary produced by the then-unknown Frank Capra. In 1925 she was deployed to China, where she remained for nearly a decade. In 1937, the old cruiser was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap. ==Design== The design for the new cruiser was based on the British-built Ottoman cruiser . The ship was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced standard and up to at full load. The ship was fitted with two pole masts. She had a crew of 14 officers and 300 enlisted men. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick, and the conning tower had the same thickness of armor plating on the sides. The main guns were protected by thick gun shields. Libia was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each of which drove a screw propeller. Steam for the engines was provided by sixteen coal-fired Niclausse water-tube boilers that were trunked into three closely spaced funnels on the centerline. The engines were rated at , though they only reached in service. This was sufficient to propel the ship at a top speed of . Libia had a cruising radius of at a speed of . The ship was armed with a main battery of two L/50 quick-firing guns, one forward and one astern. These guns were probably Pattern FF Armstrong guns, which fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, p. 96 These were augmented by a battery of eight L/45 guns, four mounted individually on each broadside. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eight L/50 guns and six L/20 guns. She was also equipped with four torpedo tubes. ==Service history== The new cruiser was laid down in 1907 at the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa for the Ottoman Empire, under the name Drama.Gardiner & Gray, p. 262 But following the rise of the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government became unwilling to pay its foreign debts, which led Ansaldo to halt construction work. Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the Italo-Turkish War.\"Italian Cruiser Libia\", p. 67 The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912, and following the completion of fitting-out work, the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913. On 3 September 1914, Libia was in the port of Durazzo, Albania when Prince William, the ruler of the country, departed following turmoil caused by an insurgency in the country, coupled with the outbreak of World War I. Libia had landed a contingent of marines to restore order in the city, where some 2,000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy. After the refugees were evacuated, Libia recalled her marines and departed as well.\"Exit Albania?\", pp. 1062-1063 Libia underway during her world tour Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.Halpern, p. 140 Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.Halpern, pp. 141-142 Libia spent much of the war patrolling the Otranto Barrage, along with the cruisers and and several Italian and French destroyers.Cavallaro, p. 624 During the war, the ship had three 76 mm L/40 anti-aircraft guns installed. In 1921 the ship went on a world tour under the command of Captain (later Admiral) Ernesto Burzagli. During the cruise, she stopped in San Francisco, United States in November, where she stayed for a month. While there, she was filmed for a short documentary by the then-unknown film director Frank Capra on 6 and 7 November --though it did not generate much attention, it was Capra's first publicly screened film. The ship departed San Francisco on 4 December.McBride, p. 133 In 1922, Libia visited Australia while on her tour.Cresciani, p. 93 In 1925, her 150 mm guns were removed. That year, she was sent to China, where she joined the armored cruisers and and the river gunboats and . These ships contributed men to form the Battaglione Italiano in China (Italian Battalion in China); the contingents from Libia were sent to guard the consulates in Beijing and Shanhaiguan.Marinelli & Andornino, p. 54 On 28 March 1929, Libia collided with the Chinese coastal steamer off Woosung, China. Kangtai sank with the loss of 30 crew members. Libia remained in Chinese waters for nearly a decade; in the early 1930s, she was replaced by the protected cruiser . In September 1935 she was drydocked to prepare for her disposal.Willmott, p. 60 She was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and was sold to ship breakers. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cruisers of the Regia Marina Category:World War I cruisers of Italy Category:Ships built in Genoa Category:Ships built by Gio.
