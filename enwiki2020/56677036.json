Set against a Muslim backdrop, it addressed contemporaries political, religious and social issues including Triple talaq and Sharia law and aimed to dispel wrong notions about Islam. ==Theme== Kabir Ahmad (Adnan Khan) and Zara Siddiqui (Eisha Singh) are devout followers of Islam but interpret the Quran differently. Kabir abides by the traditional code of conduct and Zara applies the teachings of Allah in a practical way. Kabir and Zara take us on a journey of their world where they are grappling with issues like Triple Talaq. They are married due to an agreement but gradually fall in love. However, they face a series of obstacles in their life. ==Plot== The series begins with Zara Siddiqui and Kabir Ahmad returning to Lucknow after five years and completing higher studies in Islam. When an argument about Triple Talaq between Zara and Kabir becomes viral on the Internet, they are forced to marry each other. Gradually after marriage, Zara realizes her love for the still hesitant Kabir. Rukhsaar has been in love with him from a young age and tries to split them up, who brings Miraj to create differences between Zara and Kabir though he goes rogue out to harm everyone in the family. Rukhsaar calls Nilofer to pose as Miraj's sister and instructs her to protect the family from Miraj except for Zara, but is then married off to Hamdaan Alghazi and leaves for Dubai. Miraj buys out and kills Nilofer. A misunderstanding leads to Kabir to divorce Zara using the Triple Talaq practice. It is revealed this was not a part of their nuptials and Zara refuses to accept. Miraj tells Zara that he wants her and can go to any extent, whereas she tries to have Rukhsaar return to expose Miraj's true intentions but is unable to reach her. Miraj makes his way into the local Shariah Board and turns out to be a diamond-smuggler laundering money. Miraj is arrested and Kabir's dream project loses its funding. Miraj's connection to Rukhsaar is revealed before he swears revenge on Zara and Kabir who confess their love. The family arrange their remarriage.

Deepak Rajadhyaksha, Deputy Business Head, Zee TV said, \"We started 2018 with the launch of two beautifully curated shows, Aap Ke Aa Jane Se and Kaleerein each of which has touched upon a contemporary Indian reality and is sensitizing the masses about the same. Our next primetime fiction offering belongs to the Muslim social drama space that we had, ourselves, pioneered with Qubool Hai, a show that enjoyed an immensely successful run of two seasons. Ishq Subhan Allah asks viewers to pause and reflect on the true interpretation of religion in our daily lives. It questions the true importance we accord to a woman's choice in every decision that a couple makes, including entering the institution of marriage as also ending it with dignity\". Dheeraj Kumar, the producer of the show said, \"With Ishq Subhan Allah, we want to break the stereotype and urge people to take a rational stance in matters of religion. We want to spread the message that adherence to religion cannot come at the cost of compromising practicality. Instead, one must apply the core fundamentals of one's religion to move forward in life.\" Adnan Khan expressed, \"Kabeer's character is of a young Maulvi with a thorough understanding of Islam. While he is very traditional and culture-driven, his personality and outlook is extremely different from Zara's. Being a Muslim, I could easily adapt myself to certain aspects of Kabeer's character which helped me a lot during my preparation. In fact, I could also strongly relate to his inner instincts and religious traits as I am extremely religious in real life, albeit with a modern touch. The concept of the show is extremely engaging and I am looking forward to this exciting new journey\". Eisha Singh said, \"Ishq Subhan Allah is a unique concept with a strong message. Zara is a strong and confident woman who doesn't fear any consequences and isn't afraid to ask the right questions. She is deeply rooted in her religious teachings of the holy Quran but applies them intelligently to life with logical reasoning. Zara is progressive but she isn't a rebel or an atheist. She has studied Islam in depth and stands up against the misinterpretation of its teachings. Moreover, I am really excited to play such a strong character and I hope that the audience will enjoy watching this side of me.\" In November 2019, Zee TV's home production house, Essel Vision Productions took over the production of the series from Creative Eye Limited. Owing Covid-19 outbreak, the shootings were stalled since 19 March 2020 and the series telecast was halted midway on 20 March 2020 and was expected to resume shoot after the lockdown ends.

In late June 2020, when filming was about to resume after the halt owing to the COVID\u201319 pandemic, it was reported that Tunisha Sharma will make an exit from the show and the channel has approached the original lead, Eisha Singh to return to the show.

Following the first week of its premiere, the show created disappointment between the Muslims and a complaint was filed by Raza Academy, an Islamic association based in Mumbai against the show for wrongful representation of religious facts and maligning the image of the religion. The complaint by the academy stated that the show \"shows Islam in a bad light, the scripts of the entire serial is made to understand that Islam religion needs a lot of changes, revival, amendments\". Since the show is based on a religious concept, many Muslim priests like the Shariat Board Chief, Imam Organization and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind had also raised objection against the show. Following a month of its premiere, India Today stated that the well written characters of Zara and Kabir developed the loyal fan following of the show over a month of its run and the concept of Triple Talaq has aroused the interest of the viewers and further expressed, \"Apart from its bold and relevant theme, the show's narrative has been spun in an interesting way with well-etched out characters\". On the reception of the show in such a short spam of time, Deepak Rajadhyaksha the Deputy Business Head of Zee TV said, \"In keeping with our brand philosophy Aaj likhenge Kal, it is our constant endeavor to present viewers with progressive stories that are not only entertaining but also provoke them into thinking differently, get inspired, take charge of their destiny and work towards an extraordinary future. With Ishq Subhan Allah, we bring audiences the love story of a Muslim couple where the man and woman beg to differ on matters of interpreting and applying religion to their daily lives. We have dwelled into the issue of Triple Talaaq which was never spoken about in a prime-time fiction show.
