    "text": "A Queer Book (1832) is a collections of 26 poems, mostly short narratives, by James Hogg, all but two of which had been previously published, more than half of them in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. ==Background== The earliest reference to A Queer Book is found in The Edinburgh Literary Journal in December 1830. It was envisaged as a companion volume to Songs, by The Ettrick Shepherd, which had appeared at the end of January 1831 and been well received.James Hogg, A Queer Book, ed. P. D. Garside (Edinburgh, 1995), xiii. The new volume is a collection of 26 poems, longer than those in Songs and (apart from the first two) assembled from periodicals between 1825 and 1831: more than half the poems first appeared in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Although Hogg left the final choice of poems to his nephew Robert and William Blackwood he gave fairly detailed guidance. Reluctantly, he also agreed that the two men should be permitted to modernise his 'beloved ancient stile' Ibid., xiii\u2012xvi; The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 2 1820\u20121831, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2006), 433: Hogg to William Blackwood, 15 March 1831. ==Editions== A Queer Book. By The Ettrick Shepherd, published by William Blackwood in Edinburgh and T[homas] Cadell in London, appeared at the end of April or beginning of May 1832. A thousand copies were printed.Garside, op. cit., xi, xxi. A critical edition, by P. D. Garside, appeared in 1995 as Volume 3 in the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Complete Works of James Hogg, published by Edinburgh University Press. In view of the non- authorial changes made to Hogg's text, especially the modernising of his 'ancient stile', this edition recovers texts from manuscript (in eleven cases), Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (in nine cases), and Annuals (in six cases), but it preserves the 1832 contents and their order. ==Contents== 'The Wyffe of Ezdel-more' (first publication here): *: The Laird of Gilbertoun shoots a pair of moorhens, unaware that they are two lovers transformed by a witch. Together laird and witch bury the pair (in human form), the witch singing a dirge. *: The witch tells Gilbertoun her story: after her father had sold her into slavery she burned down the royal harem, emerging from the flames as a spirit. Returning home, she found her lover unfaithful and refused to forgive him: as a consequence she was condemned to a thousand-year penance. *: The witch transforms three virgins disappointed in love into birds, one of them a lark. The lark takes Gilbertoun's fancy and he asks to be transformed himself, but the witch turns him into an unattractive crow. *: The crow Gilbertoun asks for his mother's prayers, but she arranges for him to be shot by a thresher, and he is buried (in human form). 'Robyn Reidde' (first publication here): *: Robyn Reidde, a simpleton, displays his skill in archery at an administrative meeting on the Border.

Some reviewers found it 'queer' in the English sense (as opposed to the Scottish sense of 'amusing', 'funny', 'entertaining'), mocking Hogg's 'ancient stile'. But elsewhere there was appreciation of the variety and the remarkable display of fancy.Ibid., xii, xxvi. ==References== Category:1832 poems Category:Scottish poems Category:Ballads ",
