She was the daughter of Ann Corbett of Arkboll, and Hugh MacKay of Scourie and the second wife of John MacKay, 2nd Lord Reay, with whom she had at least six children. Like her father and husband, Barbara MacKay was both a Royalist and a Presbyterian. Reverend James Fraser mentions that she was \"admired for sharpness and eloquence [...] a great historian, a smart poet, and, for virtue and housekeeping, few or none her parallel\". == References == === Sources === Category:Scottish women poets Category:17th- century Scottish women Category:1615 births Category:1690 deaths ",
