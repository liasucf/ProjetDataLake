    "text": "The unadorned rock-wallaby (Petrogale inornata) is a member of a group of closely related rock-wallabies found in northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is paler than most of its relatives and even plainer, hence its common name. The unadorned rock-wallaby is patchily distributed in coastal ranges from around Rockhampton to near Townsville. This range includes the small range of the Proserpine rock-wallaby (P. persephone), the only rock-wallaby in the region not closely related to its neighbours. Interbreeding threatens the latter species. ==References== ==External links== *John Gould's painting of Petrogale inornata Category:Macropods Category:Mammals of Queensland Category:Marsupials of Australia Category:Mammals described in 1842 ",
