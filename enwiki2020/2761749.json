    "text": "Benjamin Ambrosio Oglivie Palmer (born February 11, 1949) is a Panamanian former professional baseball left fielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox (1971\u20131973), Detroit Tigers (1974\u20131977), and Milwaukee Brewers (1978\u20131986). He also played two seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Kintetsu Buffaloes (1987\u20131988). Oglivie batted and threw left-handed. Oglivie made his MLB debut on September 4, 1971, for the Red Sox and played his final big league game on October 5, 1986, for the Brewers. He hit for power fairly well, breaking the 40-home run mark in 1980 with 41, which was good for a tie (with Reggie Jackson) for the American League (AL) lead. Oglivie hit three home runs in a game three times. In the process, he became the first non-U.S. born player to lead the AL in home runs. In a 16-year Major League career, Oglivie posted a .273 batting average, with 277 doubles, 560 bases on balls, 235 home runs and 901 runs batted in (RBI), in 1,754 games. He had 87 career stolen bases and 784 runs scored. Oglivie picked up 1,615 hits in 5,913 at bats. Continuing his pro career in Japanese baseball (NPB), Oglivie played for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, powering 46 home runs in two seasons. He then returned to attempt a comeback in American minor league baseball (MiLB); although Oglivie posted great offensive numbers in only two Double-A games, it proved to be the end of his pro baseball playing journey. Oglivie has coached at various levels for a number of different organizations, including Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Tampa Bay, and Detroit. In 2000, he joined the Padres\u2019 MLB staff for one season. The Col\u00f3n, Panama, native was one of six post-1959 players selected as part of the 2012 class inducted in the Latino Baseball Hall of Fame. Each Latin-American country (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Venezuela) had one player chosen for enshrinement, which took place in February 2012. ==References== ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders ==External links== *Ben Oglivie at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Ben Oglivie at Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Professional Baseball League) Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:\u00c1guilas del Zulia players Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League home run champions Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Kintetsu Buffaloes players Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Panama Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Sportspeople from Col\u00f3n, Panama Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Winter Haven Super Sox players ",
