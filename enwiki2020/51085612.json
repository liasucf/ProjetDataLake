    "text": "The Perodua Bezza (codenamed D63D) is an A-segment sedanhttps://paultan.org/2016/07/21/perodua-bezza-officially-launched/ produced by Malaysian automobile manufacturer Perodua. It was launched on 21 July 2016 as Perodua's first sedan car, and a complement to the Axia hatchback. The Bezza is based on the Axia's platform, and is powered by the latter's 1.0-litre engine, in addition to a new 1.3-litre plant. The Bezza is Perodua's first major in-house design. Perodua leads the styling and development of the Bezza's upper body structure, with technical support from Daihatsu. The Bezza is the second model to debut from Perodua's all-new factory in Serendah, Selangor. The Perodua Bezza was developed with an emphasis on fuel efficiency, and is the company's first model to feature stop- start idling and regenerative braking. The Bezza is also the first Perodua to feature Vehicle Stability Control (VSC). The range-topping Bezza Advance scored a 5-star ASEAN NCAP rating, making it Perodua's safest offering to date. ==Etymology== The name \"Bezza\" is derived from the Malay word beza, which means \"different\". Additionally, the letters \"zz\" in \"Bezza\" represents the number 22, as it was launched in Perodua's 22nd year in business. == History == === Pre-launch === The production of Perodua's first sedan was first hinted during the 2010 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show (KLIMS), when Perodua debuted their concept model called Bezza. Three years later, another concept model was presented by Perodua during the 2013 KLIMS; this time, it was called Buddyz. Both concept models were designed in-house by Perodua's own design and styling division led by Muhamad Zamuren Musa, without referring to any existing Daihatsu or Toyota car models, referring instead to current Chevrolet Aveo. The production of Perodua's first sedan was approved in 2015 by its Chief Executive Officer, Datuk Aminar Rashid. The production model would draw inspiration from the Buddyz concept model and was codenamed D63D. The Bezza is the first Perodua model that isn't directly based on any pre-existing Toyota or Daihatsu model. Perodua lead the styling and development of the Bezza's upper body structure, with technical support from Daihatsu. Perodua claims that the Bezza has up to 95% local content, and was developed at a cost of RM 300 million. However, Perodua did not develop the Bezza from scratch, as it is powered by Toyota-engineered engines and is based on the Daihatsu-engineered Axia platform. Unlike their rival Proton, Perodua was able to develop their first sedan model secretly without public knowledge. The Perodua Bezza competes with the Proton Saga in its home market. === Post launch === The Perodua Bezza was launched on 21 July 2016. Three variants were available at launch: Standard G, Premium X and Advance. In the beginning of April 2017, the Perodua Bezza was updated with the rear bumper given a deeper skirt for all the variants. The Premium X and Advance variant got chrome platinum trim on the air-conditioning controls and the Advance variant also gains new leather upholstery that does without the previous quilting. In April 2018, the Standard G was replaced by a GXtra variant. The GXtra comes with an enhanced kit list, where side skirts and chrome door handles have been added to the exterior. There\u2019s also a new Ocean Blue exterior colour available \u2013 an option that was previously reserved for 1.3L variants of the Bezza. Piano black trim has been applied on the dashboard and panel surrounding the multimedia system, which itself has been improved with Bluetooth connectivity. In other areas, the air-con vent surrounds, steering wheel spokes and gear lever base now gain a satin finish. Rounding things off are chrome door handles to mimic those on the outside. On 11 April 2019, a Limited Edition Bezza limited to 50 units was launched. The variant was based on the Premium X and solely with an automatic transmission. Changes compared to the Premium X variant included every GearUp accessory as well as different finishes to various components. In early January 2020, the facelift version was launched in Malaysia which brought changes to the Bezza both inside and out with the variants 1.0 G Manual, 1.0 G Automatic, 1.3 X Automatic and 1.3 AV Automatic. == Equipment == The Standard G variant is equipped with 14-inch seven-spoke alloy rims, fabric seats, polyurethane steering wheel, an audio system with USB, handphone or smartphone slot at the rear console, fixed rear seat headrests, 60:40 split folding rear seats, remote boot release, manual side mirrors without turn signals, body-mounted signal indicators, and power windows. === Exterior === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Equipment !1.0 G Manual !1.0 G Automatic !1.3 X !1.3 AV |- !Wheels |14-inch Alloy Wheels |14-inch Alloy Wheels |15-inch Alloy Wheels(Two Tone) |15-inch Alloy Wheels (Two Tone) |- !Front & Rear Bumper |Body Coloured |Body Coloured |Body Coloured |Body Coloured |- !Front Grille |Glossy Black & Silver Finish |Glossy Black & Silver Finish |Glossy Black & Chrome Finish |Glossy Black & Chrome Finish |- !Led Headlamps |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Front Fog Lamps |No |No |Yes |Yes |- !Electric Side Mirrors |Yes with turn signals (only power-adjustable mirrors) |Yes with turn signals (only power-adjustable mirrors) |Yes (only power- adjustable mirrors) |Yes (Retractable Mirrors) |- !Two-tone Back Door Garnish |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Door Handles |Chrome Finish |Chrome Finish |Chrome Finish |Chrome Finish |- !Front Corner Sensors |No |No |Yes |Yes |- !Reverse Sensors |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Reverse Camera |No |No |No |Yes |- !Rear Combination Lamps |LED (light guide & stop lamp) |LED (light guide & stop lamp) |LED (light guide & stop lamp) |LED (light guide & stop lamp) |- !Blacked-out pillar |No |No |Yes |Yes |} === Interior === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Equipment !1.0 G Manual !1.0 G Automatic !1.3 X !1.3 AV |- !Seats |Fabric |Fabric |Fabric |Leather |- !Power Windows |Yes(Driver Side) |Yes (Driver Side) |Yes (With Jam Protection on Driver Side) |Yes ( With Jam Protection on Driver Side) |- !Smart Entry & Push Start/Stop Button |No |No |Yes |Yes |- !Electric Power Steering |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Auto-off Headlamps |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !ISOFIX System |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Multi-purpose Container |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Audio System |Yes(With USB & Bluetooth) |Yes (With USB & Bluetooth) |Yes(With USB & Bluetooth) |Yes(Multimedia System with navigation & 'Smart Link' ,USB, Bluetooth & HDMI |- !Multi-info Display |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes(With 'Idle Stop' Indicator) |- !12V Power Socket |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |- !Seat Height Adjuster(Driver Side) |No |No |Yes |Yes |- !Advanced Safety Assist (A.S.A 2.0) |No |No |No |Yes |} == Powertrains == The Perodua Bezza is produced with two different engine options, paired to a manual or electronic automatic transmission.

The new 1KR-VE engine produces 67 hp at 6,000 rpm and 91 Nm at 4,400 rpm, offering a mild 1 hp and 1 Nm increase over the Axia's 1KR-DE2 plant. Perodua claims ECE fuel consumption figures of 22.8 km/l for the manual variant and 21.3 km/l with the automatic, both exhibiting a 1.2 km/l improvement over the old 1KR-DE2. The new 1KR-VE engine now features variable-valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) on the intake valves. Several minor changes and refinements were also introduced for increased fuel efficiency and more linear power delivery. Notable changes include a higher 11.5:1 compression ratio, a high-tumble intake port, a longer intake manifold, micro fuel spray injection and low-friction valve lifters. The Premium X and Advance variants are powered by Perodua's all-new 1.3-litre, four-cylinder 1NR-VE engine, which is capable of 94 hp at 6,000 rpm and 121 Nm at 4,000 rpm. The 1NR-VE is an evolution of the K3-VE engine from the Perodua Myvi. Perodua claims ECE fuel consumption figures of 21.7 km/l for the manual variant and 21.0 km/l with the automatic, while the auto-only Advance variant is capable of 22.0 km/l, courtesy of the new Eco Idle stop-start system and regenerative braking. The all-new 1NR-VE engine features dual variable-valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) on both intake and exhaust valves. Additionally, the 1NR-VE features longer ports in its intake system for improved low- and mid-range torque, and a low-friction roller rocker arm-based valvetrain for improved fuel efficiency. Both 1KR-VE and 1NR-VE engines are paired to a 5-speed manual (5MT) or 4-speed electronic automatic transmission (4E-AT). The Standard G and Premium X variants are sold with both manual and automatic options, while the Advance variant is limited to the automatic. Both 1KR-VE and 1NR-VE engines are also Euro IV compliant. The 2020 facelift version saw the discontinuation of Premium X MT variant which meant a 1.3 litre engine could no longer be paired with a 5-speed manual. == Safety == * ASEAN NCAP - () / () The Perodua Bezza features a number of active and passive safety features, and is Perodua's first model to offer vehicle stability control (VSC).
