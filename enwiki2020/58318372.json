    "text": "European Women in Mathematics (EWM) is an international association of women working in the field of mathematics in Europe. Its goals include encouraging women to study mathematics and providing visibility to women mathematicians. It is the \"first and best known\" of several organizations devoted to women in mathematics in Europe. == History == Although the group that became EWM began holding informal meetings as early as 1974, EWM was founded as an organization in 1986 by Bodil Branner, Caroline Series, Gudrun Kalmbach, Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Roy, and Dona Strauss, inspired by the activities of the Association for Women in Mathematics in the USA. It was established as an association under Finnish law in 1993 with its seat in Helsinki. In fact, the basic structure defining the convenor, standing committee and coordinators were established between 1987 and 1991. An EWM email net was set up in 1994 followed by a web page in 1997. The organization has a Scientific Committee, jointly with the European Mathematical Society and its Committee on Women in Mathematics. == Regular activities == Every other year, EWM holds a general meeting and a summer school. A newsletter is published at least twice a year, EWM has a website, a facebook group and an e-mail network. EWM coordinates a mentoring programme and awards a travel grant twice a year. === General Meetings === EWM hold a General Meeting every other year in the form of a week-long conference with a scientific program of mini-courses on mathematical topics, discussions on the situation of women in the field and a General Assembly. General meetings have been held in Paris (1986), Copenhagen (1987), Warwick (1988), Lisbon (1990), Marseilles (1991), Warsaw (1993), Madrid (1995), Trieste ICTP (1997), Hannover (1999), Malta (2001), Luminy (2003), Volgograd (2005), Cambridge (2007), Novi Sad (2009), Barcelona (2011), Bonn (2013), Cortona (2015), and Graz (2018). ===Activities at international conferences=== EWM holds satellite conferences to the European Congress in Mathematics and takes part in ICWM International Conference of Women in Mathematics, International Congress of Women Mathematicians and now World Meeting for Women Mathematicians. === Mentorship === EWM has a mentoring programme. == Convenors and deputies == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+List of elected convenors and deputy convenors of the standing committee of EWM !period !convenor !deputy convenor !deputy convenor |- |1993\u20131994 |Anna Romanowska (Poland) | | |- |1996\u20131997 |Sylvie Paycha (France) |Capi Corrales (Spain) | |- |1998\u20131999 |Laura Fainsilber (Sweden) |Irene Sciriha (Malta) |Inna Yemelyanova |- |2000\u20132001 |Irene Sciriha (Malta) |Christine Bessenrodt (Germany) |Laura Fainsilber (Sweden) |- |2002\u20132003 |Ljudmila Bordag (Germany) |Irene Sciriha (Malta) |Francine Diener (France) |- |2004\u20132005 |Laura Tedeschini-Lalli (Italy) |Marjo Lipponen (Finland) |Marie Demlova (Czech Republic) |- |2006\u20132007 |Marjo Lipponen (Finland) |Karma Dajani (Netherlands) |Laura Tedeschini-Lalli (Italy) |- |2008\u20132009 |Frances Kirwan (UK) |Marjo Lipponen (Finland) | |- |2010\u20132011 |Marie-Francoise Roy (France) |Frances Kirwan (UK) | |- |2012\u20132013 |Marie-Francoise Roy (France) |Lisbeth Fajstrup (Denmark) | |- |2013\u20132016 |Susanna Terracini (Italy) |Angela Pistoia (Italy) | |- |2016\u20132020 |Carola-Bibiane Sch\u00f6nlieb (Austria/UK) |Elena Resmerita (Austria) | |- |2020\u20132022 |Andrea Walther (Germany) |Kaie Kubjas (Finland) | |} == Similar Societies == There are many similar societies like the \"European Women in Mathematics\" society that celebrate women in Mathematics.
