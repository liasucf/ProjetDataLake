    "text": "Medvivo is a provider of telehealth and related services based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, England and owned by the Eight Roads venture capital fund. The company was founded in 2004 as Wiltshire Medical Services, in response to a change to the contract to run GP out-of-hours services for North Wiltshire Primary Care Group. Its name changed to Medvivo in 2013 after it was acquired by Moonray Investors, an arm of Fidelity Ventures, which became Eight Roads in 2015. The company acquired Medvivo Careline Limited, an alarm monitoring service formerly known as Magna Careline, in 2014 from the Magna Housing Group. In the same year the company was said to be one the major UK players in the telehealth market. It is part of the Argenti telehealthcare partnership which has a contract with Hampshire County Council for technology-based care. It is a member of the Innovation Council of the New Engineering Foundation. The company still runs the out-of-hours service for Wiltshire. It also runs an advice telephone line for health and social workers in Wiltshire and Bexley\u2019s emergency link line. Its service in Surrey is claimed to be the largest telehealth deployment in the country. Medvivo was involved, with other agencies, in a human trafficking operation at a travellers' site in Semington, Wiltshire, in April 2015. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Private providers of NHS services Category:Health in Wiltshire ",
