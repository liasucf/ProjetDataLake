    "text": "The United Monarchy () is the name given to the Israelite kingdom of Israel and Judah, during the reigns of Saul, David and Solomon, as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. This is traditionally dated between 1047 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, Rehoboam, around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Israel (including the cities of Shechem and Samaria) in the north and the Kingdom of Judah (containing Jerusalem) in the south. In contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, pointing to the lack of archaeological evidence. It is generally accepted that a \"House of David\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. There are many proponents to this view. ==Historical sources== According to standard source criticism, several distinct source texts were spliced together to produce the current Books of Samuel. The most prominent in the early parts of the first book are the pro-monarchical source and the anti-monarchical source. In identifying both sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes Samuel as having thoroughly routed the Philistines, begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler and appointing Saul by cleromancy. The pro-monarchical source describes the divinely-appointed birth of Saul (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel) and his leading of an army to victory over the Ammonites, which resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, when he is appointed king. Textual criticism also points to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a Golden Age of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, and Israel, which was comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. Modern archaeology also supports that view. Most scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later armour (1 Samuel 17:4\u20137, 38\u201339; 25:13), use of camels.(1 Samuel 30:17), cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as if they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard the conquest as legendary in origin, particularly because of the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE, rather than the 10th century, when most of the events described took place, based on both historical and legendary sources. It served primarily to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events that had been described in Deuteronomy. That gap in the historical record is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age collapse; cultural memories of times before the disaster often became embellished as stories of a \"lost golden age\", as in the Trojan Epic Cycle.Cf. ==Archaeological record== According to Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, the authors of The Bible Unearthed, ideas of a united monarchy are not accurate history but \"creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement\" that are possibly \"based on certain historical kernels.\" Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah around the 10th century BCE, but they cite the fact that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about 890 BCE and that to the Kingdom of Judah dates to about 750 BCE. That is supported by Jonathan Tubb, who argues that the story of the united monarchy was fabricated as a Golden Age tale during the Babylonian Exile. He accepts the historicity of David and Solomon but cautions, \"They must be seen... as local folk heroes and not as rulers of international status.\" Oded Lipschits wrote in the Jewish Study Bible that \"the premonarchic period long ago became a literary description of the mythological roots, the early beginnings of the nation and the way to describe the right of Israel on its land. The archeological evidence also does not support the existence of a united monarchy under David and Solomon as described in the Bible, so the rubric of 'united monarchy' is best abandoned, although it remains useful for discussing how the Bible views the Israelite past.\" On the other hand, Am\u00e9lie Kuhrt acknowledges that \"there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the united monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether), and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon,\" but she concludes, \"Against this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites, which is plausibly related to the tenth century.\" Kenneth Kitchen reaches a similar conclusion by arguing that \"the physical archaeology of tenth-century Canaan is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain.\" Aerial view of Khirbet Qeiyafa. Excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron Age site in Judah, found an urbanized settlement radiocarbon dated well before scholars such as Finklestein suggest that urbanization had begun in Judah, which supports the existence of a Judahite kingdom. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated, \"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\" The techniques and interpretations to reach some conclusions related to Khirbet Qeiyafa have been criticized by some scholars, such as Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin of Tel Aviv University. In August 2015, Israeli archaeologists discovered massive fortifications in the ruins of the ancient city of Gath, supposed birthplace of Goliath. The size of the fortifications show that Gath was a very large city in the 10th century BCE, perhaps the largest in Canaan at the time. The professor leading the dig, Aren Maeir, estimated that Gath was as much as four times the size of contemporary Jerusalem, which cast doubt that David's kingdom could have been as powerful as described in the Bible. In 2019, Finkelstein claimed that mounting evidence from archaeological digs has led him to believe that a united monarchy of sorts existed but under Jeroboam II, some two centuries after the reigns of David and Solomon. Finkelstein claimed that the Biblical narrative was likely invented under the reign of King Josiah to justify his expansion and that the historical united monarchy was the inspiration. Israel Finkelstein, in 2020, considers that Saul, originally from the Benjamin territory had gained power in his natal Gibeon region around 10th century BCE, and that he conquered Jerusalem in the south and Shechem to the north, creating a polity dangerous to Egypt\u00b4s geopolitical intentions. So, Shoshenq I, from Egypt, invaded the territory and destroyed this new polity, and installed David of Bethlehem in Jerusalem (Judah) and Jeroboam I in Shechem (Israel) as small local rulers which were vassals of Egypt. Finkelstein concludes that the memory of a united monarchy was inspired by the Saul's conquered territory serving first the ideal of a great united monarchy ruled by a northern king in the times of Jeroboam II, and next to the ideal of a united monarchy ruled from Jerusalem.Finkelstein, Israel, (2020). \"Saul and Highlands of Benjamin Update: The Role of Jerusalem\", in Joachim J. Krause, Omer Sergi, and Kristin Weingart (eds.), Saul, Benjamin, and the Emergence of Monarchy in Israel: Biblical and Archaeological Perspectives, SBL Press, pp. 43-51. ==Biblical narrative== ===Origin=== According to the Book of Judges, before the rise of the united monarchy the Israelite tribes lived as a confederation under ad hoc charismatic leaders, called judges. Abimelech, the first judge to be declared king by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo (Bet Millo), reigned over Israel for three years until he was killed during the Battle of Thebez. According to the biblical account, the united monarchy was formed by a large popular expression in favour of introducing a king to rule over the decentralised Israelite confederacy. Increasing pressure from the Philistines and other neighboring peoples is said to have forced the Israelites to unite as a state after the anointing of Saul by Samuel. The notion of kingship is treated as having been anathema and viewed as the placing of one man in a position of reverence and power that ought to be reserved for God. ===Civil war=== David and Saul become bitter enemies, at least from Saul's point of view, but sources describe Jonathan, Saul's son, and Michal, Saul's daughter and David's first wife, as assisting David to escape Saul, which ultimately leads to a brief reconciliation before Saul's death. According to the Second Book of Samuel, Saul's disobedience prompts God to curtail his reign and to hand his kingdom over to another dynasty. Saul dies in battle against the Philistines after a reign of just two years.Lemaire, Andre. \"King Saul.\" My Jewish Learning. 27 May 2014. His heir, Ishbaal, rules for only two years before being assassinated. David was king of Judah only but ends the conspiracy and is appointed king of Israel in Ishbaal's place. Some textual critics and biblical scholars suggest that David was actually responsible for the assassination and that his innocence was a later invention to legitimise his actions. Israel rebels against David and appoints David's son Absalom king. David is forced into exile east of the Jordan but eventually launches a successful counterattack, which results in the loss of Absalom. Having retaken Judah and asserted control over Israel, David returns west of the Jordan. For the remainder of his reign, he continues to suppress rebellions that arise among the people of Israel. This section of the biblical text and the bulk of the remainder of the Books of Samuel ate thought by textual critics to belong to a single large source, known as the Court History of David. Although reflecting the political bias of the Kingdom of Judah after the destruction of Israel, the source remains somewhat more neutral than the sources for the earlier parts of the text. Israel and Judah are portrayed in the later source as quite-distinct kingdoms. ===Golden Age=== Prior to the ascension of Saul, the city of Shiloh is seen as the national capital, at least in the religious sense. From an archaeological standpoint, the claim is considered to be plausible. Throughout the monarchy of Saul, the capital is in Gibeah. After Saul's death, Ishbaal rules over the Kingdom of Israel from Mahanaim, and David establishes the capital of the Kingdom of Judah in Hebron. After the civil war with Saul, David forges a strong and unified Israelite monarchy, rules from c. 1000 to 961 BCE and establishes Jerusalem as his national capital in 1006 BCE. Some modern archaeologists, however, believe that the two distinct cultures and geographic entities of Judah and Israel continued uninterrupted, and if a political union between them existed, it might have had no practical effect on their relationship. In the biblical account, David embarks on successful military campaigns against the enemies of Judah and Israel and defeats such regional entities as the Philistines to secure his borders. Israel grows from kingdom to empire, its military and political sphere of influence expanding to control the weaker client states of Philistia, Moab, Edom and Ammon, with Aramaean city-states Aram-Zobah and Aram-Damascus becoming vassal states. The imperial border is described as stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Desert, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates River. Some modern archaeologists believe that the area under the control of Judah and Israel, excluding the Phoenecian territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not exceed , of which the Kingdom of Israel had about . David is succeeded by his son Solomon, who obtains the throne in a somewhat-disreputable manner from the rival claimant Adonijah, his elder brother. Solomon's reign (c. 961 to 922 BCE) proves to be a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and cultural development. Solomon embarks on an aggressive campaign of public building and erects the First Temple in Jerusalem with assistance from the King of Tyre with whom he has maintained the strong alliance that was forged by his father. Like David's Palace, Solomon's temple is designed and built with the assistance of Tyrian architects, master craftsmen, skilled labourers, money, jewels, cedar and other goods obtained in exchange for land ceded to Tyre. Solomon goes on to rebuild numerous major cities, including Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer. Some scholars have attributed aspects of archaeological remains excavated from this sites, including six-chambered gates and ashlar palaces, to the building programme. However, excavation teams at Megiddo later established that the structures are from different time periods. Yigael Yadin later concluded that the stables that had been believed to have served Solomon's vast collection of horses were actually built by King Ahab in the 9th century BCE. ===End=== Map showing the Kingdoms of Israel (blue) and Judah (orange), ancient Southern Levant borders and ancient cities such as Urmomium and Jerash. The map shows the region in the 9th century BCE. Following Solomon's death in c. 926 BCE, tensions between the northern part of Israel, containing the ten northern tribes, and the southern section, dominated by Jerusalem and the southern tribes, reached a boiling point. When Solomon's successor, Rehoboam, dealt tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes, in about 930 BCE (there are differences of opinion as to the actual year) the Kingdom of Israel and Judah split into two kingdoms: the northern Kingdom of Israel, which included the cities of Shechem and Samaria, and the southern Kingdom of Judah, which contained Jerusalem. Most of the non-Israelite provinces became independent. The Kingdom of Israel, Northern Kingdom or Samaria, existed as an independent state until 722 BCE, when it was conquered by the Assyrian Empire. The Kingdom of Judah, or Southern Kingdom, existed as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire. ==Biblical chronology== Many alternative chronologies have been suggested, and there is no ultimate consensus between the different factions and scholarly disciplines concerned with the period as to when it is depicted as having begun or when it ended. Most biblical scholars follow either of the older chronologies established by William F. Albright or Edwin R. Thiele or the newer chronology of Gershon Galil, all of which are shown below. All dates are BCE. Thiele's chronology generally corresponds with Galil's chronology below with a difference of at most one year.Kenneth Kitchen, How We Know When Solomon Ruled: Israel's Kings, BAR September/October 2001 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Albright\u2013Thiele dates !Galil dates !Biblical name !Regnal name and style !width=20%|Notes |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|House of Saul |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |c. 1021\u20131000 |c. 1030\u20131010 |Saul |Shaul ben Qish, Melekh Ysra'el |Killed in battle, suicide |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |c. 1000 |c. 1010\u20131008 |Ishbaal (Ish-boseth) |Ishba'al ben Shaul, Melekh Ysra'el |Assassinated |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|House of David |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |c. 1000\u2013962 |c. 1008\u2013970 |David |David ben Yishai, Melekh Ysra\u2019el |Son-in-law of Saul, brother-in-law of Ish-boseth |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |c. 962\u2013c. 922 |c. 970\u2013931 |Solomon |Sh'lomoh ben David, Melekh Ysra\u2019el |Son of David and Bathsheba |} ==See also== * Biblical chronology * Historicity of the Bible * Ir Ovot * Kings of Israel and Judah * Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) (the northern kingdom after the split) * Kingdom of Judah (the southern kingdom after the split) * Israel (the modern country) * List of Jewish states and dynasties ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * Category:10th-century BC disestablishments Category:11th-century BC establishments Category:David Category:Former countries in Western Asia Israel, United Monarchy Israel Category:Political entities in the Land of Israel Category:Solomon Category:States and territories established in the 11th century BC Category:States and territories disestablished in the 10th century BC ",
