    "text": "Thank You Scientist is an American progressive rock band from Montclair, New Jersey, United States. Their debut studio album Maps of Non-Existent Places was named the Revolver Magazine \"Album of the Week\" in October 2014. Their second album Stranger Heads Prevail was released in July 2016. Their third album Terraformer was released in June 2019. ==History== Thank You Scientist was formed at the New Jersey Montclair State University's music program, when guitar player Tom Monda met saxophonist Ellis Jasenovic and trumpet player Andrew Digrius. Their musical taste for Frank Zappa, Harry Nilsson, The Beatles and Mahavishnu Orchestra would later become an influence and a seed for Thank You Scientist. In 2009 vocalist Salvatore Marrano (former vocalist of NJ rock powerhouse \u201cHello Eden\u201d), bass player Greg Colacino, drummer Odin Alvarez and violin player Russ Lynch joined the band, which became the original lineup for Thank You Scientist. The band self-released their \"The Perils of Time Travel\" EP in 2011, followed shortly after by their first full- length album \"Maps of Non-Existent Places\" in 2012. This album caught the attention of Claudio Sanchez, vocalist and guitarist for the progressive metal/rock group Coheed and Cambria and founder of Evil Ink Records, who signed the band into the young record label in summer 2014. It was the first band the label signed. A music video for \"My Famed Disappearing Act\" was released in August 2014. The deal opened multiple doors for the band, which soon started touring with Periphery in 2015, and with Coheed and Cambria later that year. a 2015 tour with Periphery , Bass player Greg Colacino left the band that year, and was temporarily replaced by James Robbins and later on by Cody McCorry of Karmic Juggernaut. Touring put new pressure on the band, which announced on September 2017 that Odin Alvarez, Ellis Jasenovic, and Andrew Digrius would leave the band, and were to be replaced by Faye Fadem on drums, Sam Greenfield on sax, and Joe Gullace on trumpet. In 2017 their song \u201cPsychopomp\u201d was included in Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps show \u201cJagged Line\u201d. They announced their next album, Terraformer, on April 5, 2019 and released the first single off that album, \"FXMLDR\" (pronounced as Fox Mulder and inspired by the television series The X-Files), on April 13. The album was released June 14, 2019. The band also released a video for \"FXMLDR\" made with solar equipment and in conjunction with Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps. ==Members== * Salvatore Marrano \u2013 vocals (2009\u2013present) * Tom Monda \u2013 electric guitar, fretless guitar, shamisen, sitar, vocals, synth, producer (2009\u2013present) * Ben Karas \u2013 electric violin (2013\u2013present) * Cody McCorry \u2013 bass, theremin, saw (2015\u2013present) * Fayehttps://www.facebook.com/ThankYouScientist/posts/10160719276249466?__cft__[0]=AZUkgHohAaYPfc_Q44jJ0F-mQE_e2wmPBBLT- BkDhxhp6gh9jZ2tp_ByPpnlq1hIifkcx40nJ2dWBMVuOoBCu71-3MHDh1KBrssT_VVUwVQnRnXPs1ajcpCq_M1ZQiiRWJGaKVrJpnzekcqBVGCBNIDhwwtyiA6n9vjP6HRFbhASxklEQ2uifbP7gpqrRo6Q6rNdkR1WeCaP2stfrByQItBp&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R Fadem \u2013 drums (2017\u2013present) * Sam Greenfield \u2013 saxophone (2017\u2013present) * Joe Gullace \u2013 trumpet (2017\u2013present) ;Past members * James Robbins \u2013 bass (2015) * Greg Colacino \u2013 bass (2009\u20132015) * Russ Lynch \u2013 violin, viola, mandolin (2009\u20132013) * George Marzloff \u2013 keyboards (2009\u20132010) * Ellis Jasenovic \u2013 saxophone (2009\u20132017) * Andrew Digrius \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn (2010\u20132017) * Odin Alvarez \u2013 drums (2009\u20132017) === Timeline === == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\"| Peak chart positions |- !style=\"width:35px;font- size:smaller;\"|US !style=\"width:35px;font-size:smaller;\"|US Alt !style=\"width:35px;font-size:smaller;\"|US Heat !style=\"width:35px;font-size:smaller;\"|US Hard Rock !style=\"width:35px;font-size:smaller;\"|US Rock |- ! scope=\"row\"| Maps of Non- Existent Places | * Released: 8 June 2012 * Label: Evil Ink / Universal Music * Format: CD, digital download, vinyl | \u2014 | 25 | 4 | 14 | 48 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Stranger Heads Prevail | * Released: 29 July 2016 * Label: Evil Ink * Format: CD, digital download, vinyl | 193 | 14 | 3 | \u2014 | 14 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Terraformer | * Released: 14 June 2019 * Label: Evil Ink * Format: CD, digital download, vinyl | 73 | 15 | 8 | \u2014 | \u2014 |} ===EPs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"| EP details |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Perils of Time Travel | style=\"text-align:left;\"| *Released: January 10, 2011 *Label: Self-released *Formats: Digital download |} == References == Category:American progressive rock groups Category:Rock music groups from New Jersey ",
