    "text": "Kabyle , or Kabylian (native name: Taqbaylit, ), is a Berber language spoken by the Kabyle people in the north and northeast of Algeria. It is spoken primarily in Kabylia, east of the capital Algiers and in Algiers itself, but also by various groups near Blida, such as the Beni Salah and Beni Bou Yaqob.(extinct?) Estimates of the number of Kabyle speakers range from five million to about seven million worldwide, the majority in Algeria, according to INALCO. ==Classification== Kabyle is one of the Berber languages, a family within Afroasiatic. It is believed to have broken off very early from Proto- Berber, although after the Zenaga language did so.'The Saharan Berber diaspora and the southern frontiers of Vandal and Byzantine North Africa', J. Conant and S. Stevens (eds),North Africa under Byzantium and Early Islam, ca. 500 \u2013 ca. 800 (Dumbarton Oaks Byzantine Symposia and Colloquia. Washington, D.C.) ==Spoken examples== File:WIKITONGUES-_Ghiles_speaking_Kabyle.webm|Wikitongues - Ghiles speaking Kabyle File:WIKITONGUES- Sophia speaking Kabyle.webm|Wikitongues - Sophia speaking kabyle ==Distribution== Kabyle Berber is native to Kabylia. It is present in seven Algerian districts. Approximately one-third of Algerians are Berber-speakers, clustered mostly near Algiers, in Kabylian and Shawi, but with some communities in the west, east and south of the country. Kabyles are the largest Berber group in Algeria, but may not constitute a majority. The populations of B\u00e9ja\u00efa (Bgayet), Bou\u00efra (Tubirett) and Tizi Ouzou (Tizi Wezzu) provinces are in majority Kabyle-speaking. Kabyle is mainly spoken in the provinces of Boumerd\u00e8s, and as well as in Bordj Bou Arr\u00e9ridj, Jijel, and in Algiers where it coexists with Algerian Arabic. Kabyle Berber is also spoken as a native language among the Algerian Kabyle-descended diaspora in European and North American cities (mainly France). It is estimated that half of Kabyles live outside the Kabylian region. ===Official status=== After the 2001\u201302 widespread Kabyle protests known as the Black Spring, the Berber (Amazigh) language (with all its Algerian dialects and varieties) was recognized as a 'national language' in the 2002 Algerian Constitution, but not as an 'official language' until 2016 after a long campaign by activists. The Arabic language is still the only de jure official language of Algeria. French is not recognized in any legal document of Algeria but enjoys a de facto position of an official language as it is used in every Algerian official administration or institution, at all levels of the government, sometimes much more than Arabic. The Berber (Amazigh) language faces an unfavourable environment, despite a public radio (Channel II, which dates back to the Algerian War), as well as a public TV channel (Channel IV or Tamazight TV). Since private ownership of TV channels is illegal in Algeria, Kabyles have launched a private Kabyle speaking TV channel, called Berb\u00e8re Television, that broadcasts from Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in France (93). In 1994, Kabyle pupils and students boycotted Algerian schools for a year, demanding the officialization of Berber, leading to the symbolic creation of the \"Haut Commissariat \u00e0 l'Amazighit\u00e9\" (HCA) in 1995. Berber was subsequently taught as a non- compulsory language in Berber speaking areas. The course being optional, few people attend. President Bouteflika has frequently stated that \"Amazigh (the Berber language) will never be an official language, and if it has to be a national language, it must be submitted to a referendum\". In 2005, President Bouteflika, stated that \"there is no country in the world with two official languages\" and \"this will never be the case of Algeria\". Nevertheless, after four decades of pacific struggle, riots, strikes, and social mobilization, including the Berber spring (1980, riots and strikes in the Kabylie region of Tizi Ouzou, Bouira and Beja\u00efa, as well as Algiers) and the Black Spring in 2001, President Bouteflika and his government stepped back and submitted to the Kabylie pressure by recognising Amazigh (Berber) as a \"national language\" without a referendum. ===Dialects=== Geographic distribution of Kabyle dialectsK. Na\u00eft-Zerrad, \u00ab Kabylie : Dialectologie \u00bb, in : Encyclop\u00e9die berb\u00e8re, vol. 26 (Edisud, 2004) Many identify two dialects: Greater Kabylie (west) and Lesser Kabylie (east), but the reality is more complex than that, Kabyle dialects constitute a dialect continuum that can be divided into four main dialects (from west to east): *Far-western: villages such as Tizi- Ghennif, Boghni and Draa el Mizan. *Western: villages such as At Menguellat, At Yiraten, At A\u00efssi, At Yanni, *Eastern: ** Eastern-West: villages such as At Mlikeche, Eastern-center : At A\u00efdel, At Khiar ** Eastern-East: villages such as At Sliman. *Far-eastern: villages such as Aokas, Melbou, At Smail. Also known as Tasa\u1e25lit and considered as a separate language by some according to Ethnologue. Mutual intelligibility with Far-western is difficult to absent. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Phonological differences |- ! colspan=1 rowspan=2 | ! colspan=1 rowspan=2 | Far-western ! colspan=1 rowspan=2 | Western ! colspan=2 rowspan=1 | Eastern ! colspan=1 rowspan=2 | Far-eastern |- style=\"text- align:center;\" !

Historically, it is thought to be the result of a pan-Berber reduction or merger of three other vowels. The phonetic realization of the vowels, especially , is influenced by the character of the surrounding consonants; emphatic consonants invite a more open realization of the vowel, e.g. a\u1e93ru = 'stone' vs. amud = 'seed'. Often /a, i, u/ are realized as . ===Consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |+ Kabyle consonant phonemes |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | ! colspan=\"2\" | Bilabial ! rowspan=\"2\" | Labio- dental ! colspan=\"2\" | Dental ! colspan=\"2\" | Alveolar ! colspan=\"2\" | Post- alveolar ! colspan=\"2\" | Palatal ! colspan=\"2\" | Velar ! colspan=\"2\" | Uvular ! rowspan=\"2\" | Pharyngeal ! rowspan=\"2\" | Glottal |- class=small ! plain ! lab. ! plain ! emph. ! plain ! emph. ! plain ! emph. ! plain ! lab. ! plain ! lab. ! plain ! lab. |- ! rowspan=2 | Stop and Affricate ! voiceless | || || ||(t ) | \u1e6d || tt || || \u010d || || || ||(k ) | k || q || q || || |- ! voiced |(b ) | b || ||(d ) | || zz || || \u01e7 || || || ||(g ) | g || (q ) || || || |- ! rowspan=2 | Fricative ! voiceless | || || f || t || || s || \u1e63 || c || c || k || k || || || x || x || \u1e25 || h |- ! voiced | b || || || d || \u1e0d || z || \u1e93 || j || j || g || g || || || \u0263 || \u0263 || \u025b || |- ! colspan=2 | Nasal | m || || || n || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! colspan=2 | Trill | || || || r || \u1e5b || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! colspan=2 | Approximant | || || || l || l || || || || || y || || || w || || || || |} ====Assimilation==== In the Kabyle language there are various accents which are the result of assimilations (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle). Some of these assimilations are present among all Kabyle \"dialects\" and some not. These assimilations are not noted in writing, such as: *Axxam n wergaz (\"the house of the man\") is pronounced either \u00ab axxam n wergaz \u00bb, \u00ab axxam bb wergaz \u00bb or \u00ab axxam pp wergaz \u00bb. (N+W=BB) *D taqcict (\"it's a girl\") is pronounced \u00ab tsaqcict \u00bb. (D+T=TS) *Here is a list of some of these assimilations: D/T+T=TS, N+W=BB/PP, I+Y=IG. Gemination affects the quality of certain consonants, turning semivowels and fricatives into stops; in particular, geminated \u0263 becomes qq, geminated y becomes gg, and geminated w becomes bb. ====Fricatives vs. stops==== Kabyle is mostly composed of fricatives, phonemes which are originally stops in other Berber languages, but in writing there is no difference between fricatives and stops. Below is a list of fricatives vs. stops and when they are pronounced (note that gemination turns fricatives into stops). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:right;\" | Consonant !

Kabyle language edition of Wikipedia. The most ancient Berber writings were written in the Libyco-Berber script (Tifinagh). Such writings have been found in Kabylie (also known as Kabylia) and continue to be discovered by archeologists. Tifinagh alphabet disappeared in the seventh century, when Latin became the official and administrative language in North Africa, as in rest of the former Roman empire. The first French\u2013Kabyle dictionary was compiled by a French ethnologist in the 18th century. It was written in Latin script with an orthography based on that of French. However, the Kabyle language really became a written language again in the beginning of the 19th century. Under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. \"Tamacahutt n wuccen\" by Brahim Zellal was one of the first Kabyle books written using this alphabet. After the independence of Algeria, some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Libyco-Berber script, which is still in use by the Tuareg. Attempts were made to modernize the writing system by modifying the shape of the letters and by adding vowels. This new version of Tifinagh has been called Neo-Tifinagh and has been adopted as the official script for Berber languages in Morocco. However, a majority of Berber activists (both in Morocco and Algeria) prefer the Latin script and see the Tifinagh as a hindrance to literacy in Berber. Kabyle literature continues to be written in Latin script. The use of Tifinagh is limited to logos. Mouloud Mammeri codified a new orthography for the Kabyle language which avoided using French orthography. His script has been adopted by all Berber linguists, the INALCO, and the Algerian HCA. It uses diacritics and two letters from the extended Latin alphabet: \u010c\u010d \u1e0c\u1e0d \u0190\u025b \u01e6\u01e7 \u0194\u0263 \u1e24\u1e25 \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e6c\u1e6d \u1e92\u1e93. == Grammar == ===Nouns=== Kabyle has two genders: masculine and feminine. As in most Berber languages, masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (a-, i-, u-), while feminine nouns generally start with t- and end with a -t, e.g. aqcic 'boy' vs. taqcict 'girl'. Plurals generally are formed by replacing initial a- with i-, and either suffixing -en (\"regular/external\" plurals), changing vowels within the word (\"broken/internal\" plurals), or both. Examples: ::argaz \u2192 irgazen \"men\" ::adrar \u2192 idurar \"mountain\" ::afus \u2192 ifassen \"hands\" As in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or cases of the noun: free state and construct state (or 'annexed state'). The free state is morphologically unmarked. The construct state is derived either by changing initial /a-/ to /u-/, loss of initial vowel in some feminine nouns, addition of a semi-vowel word-initially, or in some cases no change occurs at all: ::adrar \u2192 wedrar \"mountain\" ::tamdint \u2192 temdint \"town\" ::tamurt \u2192 tmurt \"country\" ::asif \u2192 wasif \"river\" ::iles \u2192 yiles \"tongue\" ::taddart \u2192 taddart \"village\" As in Central Morocco Tamazight, construct state is used for subjects placed after their verbs, after prepositions, in noun complement constructions, and after certain numerals. Kabyle also places nouns in construct state when they head a noun phrase containing a co-referential bound pronoun earlier in the utterance. Examples: *Free: Yewwet aqcic. \"He has beaten a boy\". (Verb\u2013object) *Annexed: Yewwet weqcic. \"The boy has beaten\". (Verb\u2013subject) After a preposition (with the exception of \"ar\" and \"s\"), all nouns take their annexed state: *Free state: Aman (water), Kas n waman (a glass of water). === Verbs === Verbs are conjugated for three tenses: the preterite (past), intensive aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (ad+aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the aorist alone is rarely used in Kabyle (in the other languages it is used to express the present). *\"Weak verbs\" have a preterite form that is the same as their aorist. Examples of weak verbs that follow are conjugated at the first person of the singular: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Verb ! Preterite ! Ad + aorist ! Intensive aorist |- ! If (to outdo) | ife\u0263 | ad ife\u0263 | ttife\u0263 |- ! Muqel (to observe) | muqle\u0263 | ad muqle\u0263 | ttmuqule\u0263 |- ! Krez (to plough) | kerze\u0263 | ad kerze\u0263 | kerrze\u0263 |} *\"Strong verbs\" or \"irregular verbs\": {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Verb ! Preterite ! Ad + aorist ! Intensive aorist |- ! Aru (to write) | uri\u0263 | ad aru\u0263 | ttaru\u0263 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Kabyle subject affixes ! colspan=\"2\" | Person ! sg. ! pl. |- ! colspan=\"2\" | 1 | ... -\u0263 | n-... |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | 2 | m | rowspan=\"2\" | t-... -\u1e0d | t-... -m |- | f | t-... -mt |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | 3 | m | i/y-... | ... -n |- | f | t-... | ... -nt |} Verbs are conjugated for person by adding affixes. These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes). The epenthetic vowel e may be inserted between the affix and the verb. Verbs are always marked for subject and may also inflect for person of direct and indirect object. Examples: : \u00ab Yu\u0263-it. \u00bb \u2013 \"He bought it.\" (He.bought-it) : \u00ab Yenna-yas. \u00bb \u2013 \"He said to him.\" (He.said-to.him) : \u00ab Yefka-yas-t. \u00bb \u2013 \"He gave it to him.\" (He.gave-to.him-it) Kabyle is a satellite-framed based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion: *d orients toward the speaker, and could be translated as \"here\". *n orients toward the interlocutor or toward a certain place, and could be translated as \"there\". Examples: * \u00ab iru\u1e25-d \u00bb (he came), \u00ab iru\u1e25-n \u00bb (he went). * \u00ab awi-d aman\u00bb (bring the water), \u00ab awi-n aman \u00bb (carry away the water). Kabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle ur attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its arguments. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by \u00ab ur \u00bb before the verb and the particle \u00ab ara \u00bb after the verb: *\u00ab Urare\u0263 \u00bb (\"I played\") \u2192 \u00ab Ur urare\u0263 ara \u00bb (\"I did not play\") Other negative words (acemma... etc.) are used in combination with ur to express more complex types of negation. This system developed via Jespersen's cycle. Verb derivation is performed by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms: causative, reflexive and passive. *Causative: obtained by prefixing the verb with s- / sse- / ssu-: ::ffe\u0263 \"to go out\" \u2192 ssuffe\u0263 \"to make to go out\" ::kcem \"to enter\" \u2192 ssekcem \"to make to enter, to introduce\" ::irid \"to be washed\" \u2192 ssired \"to wash\". *Reflexive: obtained by prefixing the verb with m- / my(e)- / myu-: ::\u1e93er \"to see\" \u2192 m\u1e93er \"to see each other\" ::\u1e6d\u1e6def \"to hold\" \u2192 myu\u1e6d\u1e6daf \"to hold each other\". *Passive: is obtained by prefixing the verb with ttu- / ttwa- / tt- / mm(e)- / n- / nn-: ::krez \"to plough\" \u2192 ttwakrez \"to be ploughed\" ::e\u010d\u010d \"to eat\" \u2192 mme\u010d\u010d \"to be eaten\". *Complex forms: obtained by combining two or more of the previous prefixes: ::en\u0263 \"to kill\" \u2192 mmen\u0263 \"to kill each other\" \u2192 smen\u0263 \"to make to kill each other\" Two prefixes can cancel each other: ::enz \"to be sold\" \u2192 zzenz \"to sell\" \u2192 ttuzenz \"to be sold\" (ttuzenz = enz !!). Every verb has a corresponding agent noun. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with \u00ab am- \u00bb or with \u00ab an- \u00bb if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions, however). *Examples: ::\u1e6d\u1e6def \"to hold\" \u2192 ana\u1e6d\u1e6daf \"holder\" ::inig \"to travel\" \u2192 iminig \"traveller\" ::eks \"to graze\" \u2192 ameksa \"shepherd\" Verbal nouns are derived differently from different classes of verbal stems (including 'quality verbs'). Often a- or t(u)- is prefixed: ::ffer \"to hide\" \u2192 tuffra \"hiding\" (stem VI), \u00ab Tuffra n tidett ur telhi \u00bb \u2013 \"Hiding the truth is bad\". ::\u0263e\u1e93\u1e93 \"to bite\" \u2192 a\u0263\u1e93a\u1e93 ::zdi \"to be united\" \u2192 azday ::ini \"to say\" \u2192 timenna === Pronouns === Pronouns may either occur as standalone words or bound to nouns or verbs. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Person ! Singular ! Plural |- ! 1st (m) | nekk / nekkini | nekni |- ! 1st (f) | nekk / nekkini | nekkenti |- ! 2nd (m) | ke\u010d\u010d / ke\u010d\u010di / ke\u010d\u010dini | kunwi / kenwi |- ! 2nd (f) | kemm / kemmi / kemmini | kunnemti / kennemti |- ! 3rd (m) | netta / nettan / nettani | nutni / nitni |- ! 3rd (f) | nettat | nutenti / nitenti |} Example: \u00ab Ula d nekk. \u00bb \u2013 \"Me too.\" Possessive pronouns are bound to the modified noun. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Person ! Singular ! Plural |- ! 1st (m) | (i)w / inu | nne\u0263 |- ! 1st (f) | (i)w / inu | nnte\u0263 |- ! 2nd (m) | (i)k / inek | nwen |- ! 2nd (f) | (i)m / inem | nkent |- ! 3rd (m) | (i)s / ines | nsen |- ! 3rd (f) | (i)s / ines | nsent |} Example : \u00ab Axxam-nne\u0263. \u00bb \u2013 \"Our house.\" (House-our) There are three demonstratives, near-deictic ('this, these'), far-deictic ('that, those') and absence. They may either be suffixed to nouns, or appear in isolation. Examples: \u00ab Axxam-a / Axxam-agi\u00bb \u2013 \"This house.\", (House-this), \u00abWagi yelha\u00bb \u2013 \"This is nice.\" (This is-nice). ===Prepositions=== Prepositions precede their objects: \u00ab i medden \u00bb \"to the people\", \u00ab si taddart \u00bb \"from the village\". All words preceded by a preposition (except \u00ab s \u00bb and \u00ab ar \u00bb, \"towards\", \"until\" ) take the annexed state. Some prepositions have two forms: one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts, e.g. ger 'between' \u2192 gar. Some prepositions have a corresponding relative pronoun (or interrogative), for example: ::\u00ab i \u00bb \"for/to\" \u2192 \u00ab iwumi \u00bb \"to whom\" ::\u00ab Tefka aksum i wemcic \u00bb \"she gave meat to the cat\" \u2192 \u00ab Amcic iwumi tefka aksum \u00bb \"The cat to whom she gave meat.\" === Syntax === Negation Predicative particle 'd' The predicative particle 'd' is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle (or any other Amazigh language). \"d\" is equivalent to both \"it is + adjective\" and \"to be + adjective\", but cannot be replaced by the verb \"ili\" (to be). It is always followed by a noun in free state. Examples: *D taqcict 'it's a girl' *D nekk 'it's me' *Nekk d argaz 'I'm a man' *Idir d anelmad 'Idir is a student' *Idir yella d anelmad 'Idir was a student' The predicative particle \"d\" should not be confused with the particle of coordination \"d\"; indeed, the latter is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state. ==Vocabulary== Kabyle has absorbed some Arabic and Latin vocabulary. According to Salem Chaker, about a third of Kabyle vocabulary is of foreign origin; the number of French loanwords has not been studied yet. These loanwords are sometimes Berberized and sometimes kept in their original form. The Berberized words follow the regular grammar of Kabyle (free and annexed state). Examples of Berberized Arabic or French words: :kit\u0101b (Ar.) > taktabt \"book\" :machine (Fr.) > tamacint \"machine\" Many loanwords from Arabic have often a different meaning in Kabyle: :al-m\u0101l \"property\" (Ar.) > lmal \"domestic animals\" (cf. the etymologies of English cattle and fee) All verbs of Arabic origin follow a Berber conjugation and verbal derivation: : fahim (Ar.) > fhem \"to understand\" > ssefhem \"to explain\". Only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, Arabic is used. They are yiwen (f. yiwet) \"one\", sin (f. snat) \"two\". The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: sin n yirgazen \"two men\". ==Sample text== In Moulieras (Auguste), Les fourberies de Si Djeh'a. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Aqerruy n tixsi !
