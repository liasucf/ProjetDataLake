The Boston Pride selected Sammy Davis with the 1st overall pick, having made a trade with the yet unnamed Toronto expansion team. Davis becomes the third Terriers hockey alum to go first overall in a professional hockey draft, following Kayla Tutino in the 2016 CWHL Draft, and Rick DiPietro in the 2000 NHL Draft. A total of 30 players were drafted, of which 16 were American, 13 were Canadian, and one was Czech. The draft included players who have already finished their college eligibility for the first time. The draft took place remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes from the WNBA and the National Lacrosse League presented the draft, as well as HC Bern general manager Florence Schelling, UFC contestant Roxanne Modafferi, and former NHL player Pat LaFontaine. Autumn MacDougall, who skates for the University of Alberta Pandas women's ice hockey program, became the first player in the history of USports women's ice hockey selected in the NWHL Draft. Taken with the 14th overall pick, MacDougall was followed by another USports skater, as Erin Locke, a forward with the York Lions women's ice hockey, was taken by the Toronto expansion team 15th overall. ==Results== ===Rounds 1\u20132=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
