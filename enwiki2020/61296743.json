Like so many of the mountains in Kananaskis Country, Mount Warspite received its name from the persons and ships involved in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, a major sea battle of the First World War. Mount Warspite was named in 1917 for the British battleship HMS Warspite, one of the most decorated and revered ships in Royal Navy history that fought during the Battle of Jutland in World War I, and survived to also serve in World War II.Battle of Jutland Alberta Historic Places The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1922 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Mount Warspite is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods.
